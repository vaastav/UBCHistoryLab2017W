ALEXANDRIA. VA. MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1372. j Tiie President's Message, which is issued , to-day in a supplement to the Gazette, will be read with iuterest, containing, as it does, re commendations and suggestions for the consid eration of all well wishers of the country. Its spirit and temper are moderate, and the op ponents of the administration will generally be found making no captious opposition, but rath er willing to accord praise whenever it can prop erly be bestowed. Direct Trade with Europe.?The llich moud Whig, in an article on this subject, says: "One of the errors which, in our opinion, has heretofore defeated the establishment of a direct trade between Virginia and Europe has arisen from the fact that there has been no con cert of action between our own cities aud those of the interior. At intervals Alexandria, Rich mond and Norfolk have severally essayed move ments, in their own behalf, looking to this trade; which hardly could have been success fully perfected by the united zeal, intelligence and means of all combined. The main cause, however, in the past failures, may be traced to the fact that it was without the earnest co operation of European merchants and capital, an impossibility to succeed under the over shadowing influences of the city of New York, whose power has wilted every similar effort by other communities more powerful in material wealth than all of the cities of Virginia com bined. The fact is becoming apparcut that to overcome these influences the interests of Eu ropean merchants and capitalists must be en listed; for, as has been well observed by a dis tinguished Virginian, t;The supremacy of New York must be fought with the capital and in telligence of England, "France and Germany.'" Mr. Ethan Allen issues a circular letter in answer to an inquiry as to the intentions of the Liberal Republican National Committee, lie says that they mean to lay on their oars and witch the tide of affairs. He is gratified with the indications as to the President's policy,and regards it as not impossible that Liberalism has obtained a substantial triumph, although it failed to elect its candidates. The carrying out of the doctrines proclaimed at Cincinnati and Philadelphia is all they ask. If Gen. Grant means, in good faith, sustained by the Repub lican party, to give the country genuine reform and a pacific policy,the vocation of Liberalism, he says, is gone. Mr. Allen recognizes Sumner, Trumbull, Schurz, Tipton and others, as the leaders of the organization, and suggests that the party may await to hear from them, with the assuranoe that it will not be an uncertain sound. ?. The Richmond Whig says:-'"If Virginia be true to herself?cherishing and defending her great laws of improvement, provided by vast outlays of treasure in aid of her own growth and prosperity; frowning down all efforts, whencesoever they may come; to cripple them or to divert them to the uses of others, and alien, interests; inducing, by liberal legislation, the introduction of capital; encouraging her young men to work out their destinies at home, rather than in other States; inviting a healthy immigration of sold men from other parts the time is near at hand when plenty and prosperi ty shall prevail within all her borders, But let her "slumber and sleep" while "foes with in and foes without" conspire to sap the very fountain from which her hopes of future pros perity do spring, she will wake, it ever, when it is too late to retrieve the damage, to find that lthe sceptre has departed from Judah.' " The message of Governor Jacob to the Leg islature of West Virginia, which m*t at Charleston on the 19th of November, reminds that body of the importance of its session, on ? account of the adoption of a new constitution, making necessary many changes in the organic law of the State. The first subject to which attention is called is the county organization. The distruction of the township system, with board of supervisors and recorder, has swept away nearly all laws on the subject of local affairs. The establishment of the county court system will require a revision of the laws of probate. The correspondence between the President and General Porter, his private secretary, ex presses their mutual esteem, and the regret they feel at sundering the1'ties that have bound them to each other." While regretting the separation rendered necessary by the step taken by Gen. Porter, (who has been elected Vice President of the Pullman Palace Car Co.) the President could not ask him to forego such an opportunity for personal advancement in a pecuniary point of view. France is again gTeatly excited. A vote taken in the Assembly showed that the Government party was in a minority. The Cabinet Minis ters forthwith tendered their resignations, but they have not yet been accepted by the Presi dent Periodicals, &c.?Leonard Scott & Co., New York, have republished the November number of Blackwood's Magazine.

The New York Herald says :?"The week in Wall street closed quiet, as if speculators were awaiting the doings of Congress before enteriug on any fresh Northwestern enterprises. Gold was steady, aud its firmness disappointed those who looked for a greater decline after the re duction of the Bank of England rate of dis count. The bank statement was a good one and promises a more satisfactory condition of the luouey market." The remarks of the public journals in this country, of all parties, on the character and the death of the late Mr. Greeley, are honora ble to their magnanimity and good feeling. Dif ferences of opinion in politics have made no difference in their expressions of kindness and sympathy, llis warmest opponents "war not with the dead." "A generous foe regards with pitying eye, Thenmn whom f?te has laid, where all must lio." A dispatch from St. John's, N. B., states that a violent storm prevailed there Friday night, doing great damage to shipping in and outside the harbor. One schooner was wreck ed iu the harbor, and five of the crew perished.

Walker made a speech on the sub ject of Immigration, from which the following is an extract: ? We have not one-quarter the population in Virginia that we ought to have. I go heart aud soul for keeping our young men at home, but we want others to help us build up the Commonwealth. The importance of immigra tion is generally conceded and it is not nececcs sary for me to say anything on the subject. As 1 came in the door the gentleman from Roauoke county (Mr. Logan) was speaking. I heard him say that he was opposed to gene ral immigration?an omnium gatherum to over run aud swamp the State. I agree with him. We want no pauper immigrants nor others to break down Yirgiuia. We can keep that class out. What we want is honest, indus trious, thrifty citizens?who will come and im prove and build up our lands. These we can easily obtain, both from the North and from Europe. But there are difficulties which must be met. We have no government lands. Most immigrants go West. They have every assistance rendered them, both in Europe and New York?and when they get in the West, they find cheap lands at government prices, and have no difficulty in locating. It is not essential for us of the South to organize such a system, but there are essentials that cannot be overlooked. Immigrants arc here?but too gradually to do much good. Private enterprise does much?but not enough. The first essential is: Correct information, sent in proper form, to be recognized wherever sent. While recognizing the value of private enterprise in this respect, there is no doubt that it has also done much injnry at times. The proper statistics, showing advantages? aud we have greater advancages than any oth er State in the Union?should be published. Our facilities to market?by rail and boat render our lands cheaper by one-half than in other States. Such statistics should go abroad by State authority, and they would everywhere be recognized and acted upon. The second essential is that some provisions or plan be devised by which emigrants, when they arrive here can find a home without hunting the State over and then probably having difficulty in purchasing the land he wants. This is a se rious difficulty. The peoplo of Virginia, like those of the old country, have a strong love for their homes?and generally are disinclined to sell. But still there is much land for sale. All such land should be placed, and its advantages given so that the immigrant may really be lo cated before he gets here; and if the represen tions made to him hold good, he settles down at once. I would like for the farmers of this Conven tion to devise some plan to meet all these diffi culties. We want system in the information as to the* location, character and prices of our lands?to aid the immigrant in finding a home. With this information scattered abroad, and our facilities of locating them, with a good line of steamers to bring them to our shores, we can bring into the State from three to five hun dred desirable immigrants per month. With in one year, one thousand have been landed at Norfolk?not all of whom have stopped in Virginia. The steerage passengers by the Al lan ships bring five hundred each. If' we oould bring every month three to five hundred indus trious, skilful men, with a capital of ?500 each, what an effect it would have upon our State. I beg you to let your action be practi cal, and it will result in great good to the State. We are in a peculiar position, and the crisis N not yet passed. Men like you can give tone to public sentiment, if you act properly. Ques tions are now coming up in the civil govern ment in which you should have a voice, for what affects the interests ef the country affects yours also. Thomas Smith, senior member of the firm of Smith & White, dry goods merchants of Pe tersburg, and the proprietor of a large whole sale house in Norfolk, died in the latter city on Friday. Governor W.

A resolution was adopted and a committee appointed to communicate with the authorities of the several railroad companies in the State, and it' possible iuduco them to so adjust the tariff of freights on their respective roads, as not to chargc more per mile for transporting the productions of Virginia?than they do on like productions of other States. The Question of fertilizers was laid on the tabic. A communication was read from the Super intendent of the Commis*ioners of Emigration of New York, containing the information that that society have now under their charge a lar^e number of emigrauts (single and families) crc sirous of obtaining employment. Some of these emigrants are mechanics and tradesmen, and others arc farmers and farm hands and laborers. A report on tobacco was read, containing much valuable statistical and practical informa tion, and demonstrating that as a paying crop none excels tobacco in the region of country adapted to its growth aud lull development. The report recommends the sending of a com mittee to the Legislature to ask the repeal of the law, which requires the withholding from the producer of eight pounds from each pack age of tobacco iuspccted and sold in our marr kcts. The report further recommends the for mation of township and county agricultural clubs throughout the State. The following resolution was unanimously adopted: Resolved, That the sense of this Council is that the late amended law, making the tax on manufactured tobacco uniform, and reducing the same to 2U cts., is a step in the right direc tion, and that the planters of Virginia will hail with pleasure the day when the whole Internal Revenue on tobacco will be abolished. In commenting upon the proceedings of the Convention the Petersburg Indexsays:?"The proceedings were characterized by a more than usual definiteness of aim and desire to act rath* er than to make orations. It can hardly be but that good will come of the assemblage and the council held by its means." Per contrn, the Richmond Dispatch says : "The Convention of farmers in Petersburg seems to have resulted in nothing decisive or practical. There was a great deal of discus sion, some personal wrangling, and there were debates over subjects that ought not to have been introduced. But we cannot sec that any thing whatever was accomplished by the gath ering. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, upon being elect ed Psesident of tnc State Society, gave 80?ce excellent advice to the farmers. Let farmers follow this, and they won't want much help from the State. Economy, industry, close husbandry, the saving of everything, the wast ing of nothing, and tilling well a small area rather than skimming unfriuifully a large one. These rules will take care of .the farm and in sure its production." And theRiehmondWhig says :?"YVe are informed that the constitu tion has given so much dissatisfaction to some of the farmers who were present that they in tend to issue a call for a Convention to be held in Richmond on the 14th of May, 1873, for the purpose of forming a "State Agricultural Con gress." At the recent term of Judge Rives' Court, in Abingdon, the Virginian says: "The old case known in this county for the last forty years, as the Vint & Allen case, came up and was disposed of at last.

Wiirrentun Index, Mr Greeley's LrFE insured.?Horace Greeley was insured for $10/101) in the National Life Insurance Company of Uuited States of America, being part of $100,000 that the Tri bune Association had on his life. The New York Sun says, at the time of effecting the in- j surance .the Tribune's stock, was changing hands at from $3,500 to $4,000 a share, show ing the total valuation of the institution to have been from $350,000 to $400,000. One hundred thousand dollars was then viewed as a very mod erate estimate of the pecuniary loss which the Tribune would sustain in the death of Horace Greeley; but the chances of that dire calamity to the Tribune seemed so remote that no motion was made to ineroase the life insurance not even after the hundred shares which represent the en tire Tribune Association had rison to $10,000 each. Some of the Tribune's stock was recently sold at a smaller figure, but the stockholders still estimate the eutiro property at a rouod million. Tjie New York Gas Companies charged that city in 1871 with $*41,436.41 for a ten months' gas bill for 18,307 lamps.

The bills charged more per thousand feet than private citizens paid. Thk Xri'i iAi.s of James 1'. Willettof Wash imrton ami Miss Laura Welch, daughter of our , popular townsman JamesS. Welch, attrac ed I an immense number o. persons to tans Church last Thursday evening Long before tho urrivnl of the bridal party the doors ol the .acred edifice had to be closed to the great chavirin of the outside multitude, who d?.ubt l,-.s supposed its capacity had not already beeu wli tested. The following named gentlemen acted ns u>hcrs: Mes,rs. McKenncy, McBlair, KouflF. Berry, and Ashley.

She looked charming in an elegant white corded silk dress en trame and pearls, and the gentleman to whom she was about to nilclit her haud, as he moved up the aisle, was perfectly composed, his maiuly bearing s,-,?ming to indicate consciousness of the great prize he was about to bear away from our town. The marriage ceremony was perwrmea by Rev. Dr. W. \V. Williams, Hector of Christ Church, amid profound silence and atten tion. The happy couple repaired thence to the residence of the bride on First street, where for two hours the...received the hear y congratulations of a wi...;?ircle of friends, lhe bridesmaids, it sliou^- * stated. lent no incon siderable charm to L K -egant scene presented in the spacious, antly-hfjhied parlors of Mr. Welch's hosier Ly mansion, Miss tannic Welch, especially'1hooking like a bride, her pracful figure and flowing robes adding greatly to the splendor of the occasion, She too wore a full set of pearls. The bridal presents dis played on a side table in one of the payors were of the most costly kind, and in sufficient variety to bring each and all into use or orna mentation hereafter. The supper room was abundantly supplied, no pains or expense I av in" been spared by the host; and the ur?t company, It is safe to say, took their departure impressed with the conviction that at no time litis a reception been held here which was at all comparable with that given by Mr. and Mrs. Welch on the occasion of their daughter s mar riairo.

Tiik Lwiislativk Trouiu.k in Alabama. \ dispatch from Montgomery on Saturday ui-ht says : This morning detachments of the Seventh United States Cavalry marched to a point twenty yards from the Capitol grounds and bivouacked. Intense excitement ensued, but learning that the troops were intended tor a mere posse comitate, and not to drive the Legislature from the Capitol, the excitement subsided somewhat. The Legislature at the Capitol passed a bill and sent it to Governor Lewis but he refused to receive it. A joint resolution was then passed, raising a committee to communicate the facts of the situation oy telegraph to the Government at Washington, and appointing a delegation to uresent a written statement of the case to the 1 ffldeut:, .1, Legislature expresses great confidence that the President will sustain it when the facts are laid before him. In answer to a committee ot the Capitol Legislature, Governor Lewis yes terday replied that two bodies claimed his re c Coition : that the members of the other re ceived a majority of the votes cast, and that he could not recognize the Capitol legislature be cause if the persons who, he said did not re ceive a majority were not excluded, the bod> would be without a quorum. 1 ThoCourtlIoa.se body did notlnog to day but has boon in secret session a considerable portion of the day. The Washington Chrouiclc of yesterday says. "A private dispatch to the Second Assistant Postmaster General, yesterday, announced the renomiuatinn of Senator Spencer by acclama lion on Friday evening. N 0 explanation ac couipanics the statement.. Our inference 18. in the absence of information to the contrary, that the nomination was made by a caucus of the bolters' branch of the Legislature. If there has not been a union of the two bodies we may look for another nomiuauon and elec tion in"the other body. In such an event it will be impossible for Congress to recognise either body, and the election will be rewauded to the Legislature. There ought to uo enough respect for law and right in Alabama to prevent the spectacle presented. Falls Cuurcii.?At Falls Church ou Thanksgiving clay all business was suspended.

The Electoral College.?Some interest is manifested as to the probably action of the presidential electors i'or the States which were carried by Mr. Greeley. In consequence of the death ot Mr. Greeley the votes which would have beeu given to him must now be east for somoone else. Suggestion has been made that the entire body of electors ca*t their votes for Gonernl GraDt, but it seems to meet with but little if any favor, and is without doubt imprac ticable. If tim? affords to obtain a concert of action between all the Greeley electors the eompilment of their votes may be bestowed up on some such distingished conservative as Mr. Buckalow, of Pennsylvania, Gen. Hancock, Mr. Hendricks of Indiana and others, and if this is inpossible, the individual electors can of course follow the bent of their own inclinations.
