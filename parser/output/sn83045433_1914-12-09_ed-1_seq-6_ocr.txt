WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER , 114. the outstanding features of his address were his admirably presented appeal for a wise economy in the expenditure of the people's money, and his un compromising opposition to any investigation or agitation for the purpose of putting the army and navy on anything like a war footing. The President's appeal for a government-owned merchant marine was disappointing and noncon vincing. There was an expectation that he would have some enlightening facts to submit upon the demands of our foreign trade with relation to the carrying capacity of the ships at our command. In stead, his argument was fairly well illustrated in his own dogmatic assertion that "it may seem a re versal of the natural order of things, but it is true, that the routes of trade must be actually opened by many ships and regular sailings and moderate charges before streams of merchandise will flow freely and profitable through them." There was no escaping the impression that de cidedly it was a "reversal of the natural order of things." The specter of government ownership ap- A special help, of course, has been the develop ment of the business of furnishing supplies to the belligerent nations in Europe. This, no doubt, is a temporary business, but it has come in mighty handy for the country just at this time. In the great farming region west of the Mississippi River, and to a lesser extent in the Eastern States, the high prices of agricultural products have in these districts staved off the ill effects of the war whose general influence has affected the country con sidered as a unit Now, if our agitators and politicians can only let us alone, and ft the Interstate Commerce Com mission will see the light, fairly good times may perhaps be seen in our country whether or not the war in Europe comes to a speedy end. Unimportant If True By DR. 

ERITAS Villa and Zapata have publicly announced an agreement to work together and "retire to private life when their work is accomplished." according to the latest from Mexico City. Well, tnere can't I peared a little less alarming, though the taxpayer be much left for them to do. Not very many people are left alive in Mexico and most of them must be broke. President Wilson must be commended for dis playing the courage of his convictions in refusing to grant the department clerks two half holidays on which to do their Christmas shoppine. He would have done better, however, had he refrained I gage private capital, and engage it in abundance, could hardly feel comforted when the President added : "It is not a question of the government monopo lizing the field. It should take action to make it certain that transportation at reasonable rates will be promptly provided, even where the carriage is not at first profitable; and then, when the carriage has become sufficiently profitable to attract and en- froni giving reason or excuse. In explaining that "he does not find that he has any real sanction of law for such an executive order" he asserts a truth that is no less obvious than that there is nothing in the law to forbid such an executive order. Senator William Alden Smith says the United States troops were withdrawn from Mexico in compliance with twenty-four hours' notice served on President Wilson by Carranza, a charge even more worthy of investigation by the Senate than the allegation that United States Senators were paid $75,000 to use their influence to have our sol diers ordered home. If Senator Smith's charge is true, it would indicate that even if his colleagues got the money they fell down on the job. Representative Henry met defeat yesterday in his first attempt at this session to bring up his cotton finance bill, which he persisted in despite the efforts to dissuade him by Postmaster General Bur leson and Secretary of the Navy Daniels, who were in the House to hear the President's message. The cotton situation is steadily improving, 760,349 bales being exported in November, bringing the total for the past three months up to 1,400.000 bales. Mr. the government ought to withdraw. Upon the subject of economy the address faith fully voiced the people's views, no doubt. "I as sert with the greatest confidence," said the Presi dent, "that the people of the United States are not jealous of the amount their government costs if they areure that they get what they need and de sire for the outlay, that the money is being spent for objects of which they approve, and that it is being applied with good business sense and man agement." Yet, with a "war" tax in force in time of peace, the taxpayers will not be blamed if they look askance at several items in the billion-dollar budget now before Congress. Seldom has President Wilson been so bitterly outspoken as he was yesterday in his antagonism to those who would see the country better prepared for war. He spoke with forceful earnestness, and as one empowered to enunciate on behalf of the people a permanent policy opposed to a standing army, while admitting, though with apparent re luctance, the wisdom of maintaining a navy- But the solemn faces of the Republicans, as the mem bers of the President's party greeted with cheers and derisive laughter his cutting reference to "some among us who are nervous and excited," Henry has got all the glory possible out of cotton; ! showed plainly that the question of our national he might as well stop wasting the time of the House. The Industrial Relations Commission in its re port to Congress gives nine causes of industrial unrest, nearly all of which have long been recog nized, not only in this country, but in Europe, defenses was not disposed of by the President's broadside. "What is meant by being prepared?" he demanded. "Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief notice to put a nation in the field, a nation of men trained to arms? Of course, we are not ready to do that; and we shall never be in time of peace so long as we retain our present political principles and institutions." From Woodrow Wilson in the thoueh the commission went to the trouble of ex amining 514 witnesses, of which 181 were affiliated I year 1914 back to George Washington in 1793 is with employers; 183 affiliated with labor, and 150 not affiliated with either group. The witnesses in cluded seven members of the Industrial Workers of the World, and six representatives of the So cialist party. The commission has yet to submit its conclusions. If it can point the way to removal of the conditions disclosed as the result of so much labor and expense, it will confer a great and last ing benefit upon the country. Representative Prouty's plan to devote all reve nues of the District of Columbia to the payment of its expenses, the balance of the necessary expendi tures to be appr.rpriated from the Federal Treasury, is alluring in view of the discussion over what to do with the District surplus. As a matter of fact, it means a ruthless and doubly dangerous violation of the organic act of 1878. With a fair and liberal Congress in control, disposed to observe the intent a long, long way; Out tnere sun are patriots wno will ponder as they read the words of the twenty eighth President of the United States and then turn to those of the first: "If we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times prepared for war." Encouraging Business Reports. To the many indications that have been afford ed in recent weeks of a turn for the better in our business affairs and of the imminence of a country wide business awakening, must be added the facts contained in the address delivered by John Hays Hammond at the annual meeting of the National Civic Federation in New York a few days ago. Mr. Hammond's conclusions were based upon reports contained in hundreds of letters received from Combating Ideas. By 

JOHN D. BARRY. TN one of the leading colleges of the country there is a very interesting lecturer. His department is political econo my and he advocates what we sometimes call "advanced ideas." He belongs to the new type of teacher, the type that enjoys ridiculing and breaking down the old, academic con ventions. He is so unconven tional in his ways that if he had been born in an earlier pe riod he would hover have been permitted to instruct the youth of any respectable educational institution. Sometimes he goes so far that even his admiring students are shocked. In fact, I suspect that he particularly enjoys shocking the established conventions of youth. He knows that there is no other conservatism in the world more rigid. For several months I happened to be in fre quent contact with this professor. He had an amazingly brilliant mind and I used to enjoy hear ing his talk. His was the kind of talk one couldn't reply to unless one happens to be brilliant oneself. The best one could do was to listen in silence while one's pet ideas were rolled in the dust and then to go home quietly and think. The professor rather liked this attitude on the r takn Hav tax. King Coal has the laugh on King Cotton. Tne fruits of victory are sometimes very bitter. . f Charity encourageth a multitude of beggars, too. f v A girl's feet never get ccM if she has on silk hose. Is it possible to prepare for peace in time of war? It is rather unkind to call a wooden-legged man a stick. Love of country is a fine thing, but it gets people into a lot of trouble. Congress is in session again, and there is no talk of removing the war It looks as if the Chicago police force had been taking lessons from that of New York. Mr. Edison seems to think that sleep is a pernicious habit that ought to be broken up. There is reason to suspect that some people do favors just to get to talk about them. As a country, we are neutral, and some of the people n the country are neutral, too. It may be that the only way to get a larger navy will be to establish a merchant marine. I Mr. Bryan addressed a convention of Elks, which is quite different from a Bull Moose convention. If you will put off until tomorrow what you could do today you may avoid some mistakes occasionally.

"Borne of th-1 hie; men of the town were also very fond of Thoreau. When he was dvins of consumption Judtre Hoir. who lived acres, the street, used frequently lo take flowers to him, and I have heard llu- judce's brother, who of the law and appropriate the full amount of the , corresp0ndents in every section of the country by District s revenues, togetner wan an equal amount from the national treasury, it would work well. But whenever parsimony and ill will toward the people of Washington prevailed on Capitol Hill it would mean not only robbery of the taxpayers of this city, but a deteriorating Capital as well. Prouty is simply trying to disguise the old attack on the half-and-half system; but the other members of him as chairman of the federation's industrial eco nomics department. It may be said, generally, that the only really despondent chord in these communications to Mr. Hammond was sounded by the charity organizations. Many of these societies complained bitterly of the lack of funds. But taken as a whole all the people with whom Mr. Hammond put himself in communication and these included the House, happily, have been enlightened as to ; bank officerSi railroad heads, manufacturers, men in the personal animosities and spite which inspire such outbreaks, and the Prouty proposition will hurt the Capital less than it will its author. Congress evidently is about to enter upon an other discussion of what to do with the sur plus revenues of the District which it de clines to appropriate for improvements that are urgently needed. The taxpayers of Washington are helpless, but they can hardly be expected to view complacently the attempted diversion of the funds contributed by them so long as the public school system of the Capital, for instance, is suffer ing from lack of funds. Last April the Western High School was practically destroyed by fire and Congress at the last session made a meager appro priation for the purpose of restoring it, but no ap propriation was even asked for furnishing and equipment. Again this session there is failure to include in the District appropriation bill the amount necessary to equip the building when it shall have been restored. There is urgent need of increased school facilities in Washington and there has been unnecessary delay in rebuilding the West ern High School. Apparently, it is to be a hare and tortoise race between the completion of the building and the providing of a fund with which to furnish it But there is no reason for perplexity over what to do with the District's money while so many nrsainT needs of this sort are ignored. charge of life insurance companies, boards of trade, heads of trade unions, labor bureaus, provident loan associations, and the like declared that present conditions were improving and that the signs for trtc future, considering the experiences of the past eighteen months, were distinctly encouraging. One general phase of these reports may be men tioned, and that is the confidence in the establish ment of the new Federal reserve banking system as a favorable factor. The Federal banks will, it is felt, not only release funds for lending, but the re discount feature of their operation will tend to be come more and more important, so that greater effi ciency and elasticity will be given to our currency supply. Another feature common to all the reports was the practical consensus that nothing would help the business situation more than some proof that our railroad companies were to be no longer harried by public and government hostility. There was a universal recognition of the truth that a large number of the fundamental industries of the country either depend directly upon the railroads or take their business cue from railroad activity. These include, not to mention all of them, the iron and steel industry, the electrical trades, the equipment companies, the lumber interests, and almost every enterprise connected with construction and build ing work Numerous letters received by Mr. Hammond re- He had the kind of mind that resented what was accepted, or re spected, or conventional, or popular.
