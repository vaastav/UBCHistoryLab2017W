3RrV 7fim&&' r" HOW THEY LIKE IT. Opinions of Representative Citizens - on Harrison's Message. TARIFF AEG03IESTS INDORSED. Government Subsidies Suits the American Shipping Irfajne. orrosiXG views on tiie force bill The President's message to Congress is not read with undue eagerness in Pittsburg. Yesterday, hours after the publication of 3Ir. Harrison's missive, hundreds of prom inent and intelligent citizens were asked their opinions of the document. Very few, comparatively, had read it The majority ol the persons approached said that they had not seen it and intimated that they did not care whether they read it or not. Under such circumstances the gathering of senti ment was discouraging. Some representat ve citizens had perused it, and their opinions are given below: James B. Scott The President's indorse ment of the McKinlej biil suits me. "We are all for the tarill around Pittsburg. As for the Federal elections bill, everj thing de pends on the agencies employed to enforce it. It wouldn't work in some places, and would stir up dissension. Iu other localities it would be perlcctly satistactorr. Iu other particulars Mr. Harrison's views coincide witli mine. THE rKESIDENT 

INDORSED. Captain TV. "V. O'Neil, the river coal operator I have been a life-long Kepub can, and, as a Republican, I would indorse the President's views on public questions. I haven't had time to read the message in de tail, but, lrom what I have seen of it, I think Mr. Harrison is on the right track. Major Conrad Kay Harrison is all right. A. H. Logan, the oil man I would have absolute free trade all over the world, if that were possible. Let a mar make what he can, and sell if where he wiil, at the best advantage to himself. Intant industries, however, need protection. It is the best thing lor the country and people in the end. This has been demonstrated in the case of plate glass. Home production has brought down the price one-half, and it is becoming cheaper everv day. I am opposed to the Federal election bill. The country is cursed with too much legislation. I don't think the general Government has a right to dictate to the Stales in the matter ot holding elections. Why curround the polls with armed officers? The effect would not be beneficial or con tribute toward having an honest election and a iair count. 

THAI THE SHirn.G LEAGUE TTAXTS. George A. Kelly As a member of the American Shipping League, I am most in terested in subsidies for American steam chips and the passage of the shipping league and tonnage lulls. In a former message the President declared himself in lavor o restoring the American marine throuih Governmental aid, and I see in this message he calls attention to the two bills I have re ferred to, and uges their passage. This is in line with what the league desires, and meets my approbation. 1 was afraid the ocean mail service bill, in troduced by Senator Fry, was not in accord with the League measure, but I discovered on examination that it was framed to be in harmony with it. The restoration of the American marine is an important subject, ana we hope these bills will be passed by the House. Most of the Southern members had declared themselves in favor of the measures, but when they were indorsed bv the administration they were forced by the party Jash to occupy an inconsistent "posi tion, ana they fought us. Xpw, that the Democrats are coming into power, I think they will redeem their former pledges. The South will be greatly benefited by their pas sage. 

COKGEESS IIELrS TRAVEL. Division Passenger Agent Smith, of the Baltimore and Ohio road I haven't read the message, but I am a tariff man. I am glad Congress has reopened. It will mate more business for the railroads. Postmaster McKean The President is my chief. That is all I have to say. W. A. Herron The message strikes me as a very forcible document, and according to my way of thinking, the President's utterances on all the great questions of the day are sound. His views o. the tariff laws are particularlv forc.ole. These laws have not yet been tested, but when they have been I believe they will prove of great benefit. As for reciprocity, I am more and more convinced every dav that it will become one of the great bulwarks of the Republican party. I am astonished at the remark able Ehowiug nude by the farmers. The increase in tiie market price of their leading products far surpass my most sanguine expectations. That part of the messagf whicn deals with the question of fair and honest elections is simply unanswer able. The country is in a remarkably pros perous condition. Business is good, wages the same, and employment for all who nre really anxious for it." We have had a little financial flurry of late, but I attribute that almost entirely to stock speculations. 

PLEASED 1VITII HAEfilSOX'S VIEWS. District Master "Workman Joseph L. Evans I thorough! vadniire the President's unmistakable views regarding tariff legis lation. There is no doubt that the McKin ley bill is not understood by the great mass ot people. All that is needed is time in which to develop its merits, and then the sentiment iu its favor will bcoverwhclming. I am also plersed with the President's bold, honest and fearless stand on the question of honest elections. I do not see how any one can object to such manly views. Colonel Willi im H. Reed The message is clean cut, dignified and verv forcible, particularly as it refers to the great issues that now confront the people. The Presi dent's views on the euhjeet of free and hon est elections suit me to the litter. This is an issue that must be met, and the Repub lican party must be largelv depended upon to meet it. The indorsement of theMcKin Icy bill is also a strong point, ana a sound one. Taken as a whole, 1 regard the mes sage as one of the ablest that has ever gone before the people. Er-Secretarv William Martin, of the Amalgamated Association President Har rison is undoubtedly correct when he says the recent tariff legislation is not properly understood. My firm belief is that when the various branch's of it are in foil opera tion the people, and particularly the work ing classes, will find it an absolute blessing. From a hasty pei us.il I also think the ut terances on the subject of honest elections should meet with general approval. The last year has undoubtedly been a prosperous one, generally speaking", and I hope this condition may continue. 

STEOKG KECIPEOCITT AEGC21ENTS. Samuel P. Andrews. Prineinal nf ih Howard School I expected the late tariff legislation wouia receive hearty support, but with all due deference to Major Mc Kinley and his bill, I doubt whether it will suit the whole country, particularly the farmers of the great West. The arguments in favor of reciprocity are strong, and I think that this issue will have to be relied upou largely for the salvation of the Ke publican party. Major J. F- Denniston, City Treasurer The President's recommendation for a close inspection ot private pension bills is well timed. I have always held that the Gov ernment has. been very liberal in its deal ings with veterans, and I am not in favor of private pension unis, except in exceptional cases. General and private went into the annv with the same object in view to preserve the country at the expense of their lives, it necessary. The private took as many chances as the General, while his nnA dti.inc nptlTP firviiA ip nAt nA4l so great. I lavor private pension bills lor J w the recognition of exceptional services or unusual gallantry. K. S. Morrow, City Controller I haven't read the message yet, and I don't believe I'll have time to until Christmas. A 

GSAHITE STATE AGENT AERESTED. S. W.Ritter, of McKeesport, Sent to Jail to Await a Hearing. Detective Robinson yesterday arrested S. W. Rirter on Fifth avenue.
