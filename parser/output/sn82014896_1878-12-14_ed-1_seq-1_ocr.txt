Each man has some part to play: Tho past and the future ure nothing In the face of tho ntern to-day. Rise from your dreams of tho future, Of gaining some hard-fought field. Of storming some airy fortress Or bidding Rome giunt yield; Your future has deeds of glory, Of honor (God grant It may!) But your arm will never bo stronger Or tho need so great an to-day. Rise! If the past detains you, Hersunshlno and storms forgot; .No chains so unworthy to hold you As those of a valu regret: Sud or bright, sho Is lifeless ever, Cast her p.mthom arms away. Nor look back, havo to learn tho lesson Of a noble strife to-day. Rise! forthedny Is passing! The low sound that you scarcely hear Is the enemy marching to battle Arise! for the foe Is here. 5tay not to sharpen your weapous, Or the hour will strike you at last, When from dreams of a coming battle You may wake to And it past.

Some ot the Los Angeles papers have said a good deal on this subject. The following letter was addressed to a gentleman in Sacramento in connection with the pending discussion of the matter in he constitutional conven tion. It contains information that is surely of interest to Arizona people. It sho.vs how easily the public may ue misieu oy reckless newspaper charges. Until it is shown, and we doubt if it can be. that Mr. Stubbs does not present the facts fully and clearly, his letter will convince all fair men that tne railway company is not guilty of discriminating against Los Angeles, either to her own detriment or that of Arizona: Sax Francisco, November 23, 7S. Dear Slit: In reply to your in quiry regarding the alleged discrimi nation against Los Angeles in the mat- ter of Arizona freights, I invite your attonlion to the following facts: All rail rates on first-class freight are: Sanj Francisco to Yuma, $52 per ton : Sun Francisco to Los Angeles, $23 per ton ;j continued in session until June 4, of the same year, was composed of dele gates from nearly all the civilized! countries of the world.

Here are a few very interesting remarks made by President Hayes in his late annual message to Congress; the first being called out because of the failure of Congress to appropriate money enough to effectually apply present laws, and the second in consequence of the nearly universal extension ofj postal facilities: The following questions are present ed: Should Congress finally appro priate a sum Ibr ils expense largely in excess of its revenues, or should such rates of postage be established as will make the Depsriment self sustaining? Should the Postal Service be reduced by excluding from the mails all mat ter which does not pay its way? Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or diminish the expenses of the Postal Service? The International Postnl Congress, which met at Paris, May 1st, 1878, and Los Angeles to Yuma, 33.40 per ton That is to say, first-class freight, if shipped trom San Francisco to Los Angeles, and forwarded thence to Yuma, will cost $23 plus $35.40, or 53.40 per ton; while it can be ship ped from San Francisco direct for $32 per ton, showing a reasonable differ ence of 0.40 per ton in favor of the continuous as against the broken haul, with the cousent of the President, But this apparent difference does not August 13, 1878. in its origin the in reality exist, when it is remembered Postal Union compromised 23 coun that the railroad company docs not rc-j tries having a population of 350,000,000 ceive the bulk of the business or con-jof people.

David Swing of Chicago: As nations do not rise in a daj so in a day they cannot be overthrown. There are some singular records in history. It seems that a great nation cannot turn on its axis more than once in 400 or 500 years. Some of the old States lie outside the bounds ol history, but those inside these bounds show great uniformity in marking the time of radical changes of dinasty. Egypt was under shepherd Kings about 500 years. Her golden age when she so flourished in art spread over 300 years. The Hebrew Republic ran from Moses The Use of the Millions. Southern "Pacific- While the body of Millionarie Van- derbilt lay awaiting sepulture, thieves stole from ihe bell-pull the long stream er of bombazine which told of the presence of a corpse in the house.

On ship ments of gram and other cereals, the natural products of Los Angeles coun tv, the rates Irom San Francisco to Yuma arc the same as the rates to and from Los Angeles.

" Hie jacet" will hardly dolor an inscrip tion, aud something else will have to be devised. Millionaire Whitakor was gathered to his fathers, and soon the thieves and forgers began to conspire to steal what he had left behind him. An old millionaire, who some vears ago died m this city, spent the lastj years of his life in mouruiujj over the! way in which some people r- bbed! him, and he feared that others would. 1 To his last hour he was miserable lite Jieapmg up ol vast amounts of riches does not seem to have been attended, as a general tiling, with solid good, either to thos.c who heaped them Behold through wliat turmoils a France! or to'their heirs. A great part of this has come. The Atheist and Comma nists assailed her. Napoleon drained her of men and money by wars of am bilion, other rex-olmions came, then came the usurpation ot Napoleon, then the German war with defeat and a line of a thousand million of dollars, and yet to-day France comes out of Ihe-e commotions a wise and powerful Re public. Who Would be a Witness ? The following communication to the Silver Belt furnishes material upon indicates, a universal union, regulat-! which our law makers should carefully ing upon a uniform basis of cheap postage rales, the postal intercourse between all civilized nations. Geneual Siiekhax in his annual report to the Secretary of War pulls the wool over the eyes of that cabinet of ficer with the intention, through him, of deceiving,-Congress. Hu expresses groeUcorieeiirTorUs'vvollare,iPAri7'.ona and is apprehensive of au Indian war, The General recently made a llyini; trip through Arizona, and should have known belter than to have given ut terance to such au unfounded belief. The Indians of Arizona are better dis posed toward the whites now than for the past thirty years. All that is ue- meditate. All good citizens will glad ly sacrifice something in order to se cure the puuishmcnt of public en emies, but there are few who can af ford such sacrifices as are mentioned here.

The General, after stat ing his readiness to respond promptly to any summons of the Commission, says: "I am sure, from official and personal intercourse, that Secretary Schurz and Commissioner of Indihn Affairs Hoyt have been extremely anxious to and have labored hard for an honest administration of the affairs' of the Indian Bureau as organized by law.

Fremont, in a Report to tho Secretary of the interior, expresses the opinion that the control of Indians here should be transferred to the military. We ex press the contrary opinion, believing it is better to leave well enough aloue. The Indians of this Territory are con tented and happy, and, seemingly as harmless as doves, as now governed.
