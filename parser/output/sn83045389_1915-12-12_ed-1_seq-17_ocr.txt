There Is a narrow strip of Ditch tor-' r I lory which thrusts )'s way so ith w urdu between Germany and Uelgi un. It was round that strip of territory thiit ihe'Iermar. hosts poured into 1.>1-| gllim in the early days of the war. Ihe invader- moved rivl t along the Dutch frontier. And something happened, or 1* alleged to have happened. In that narrow strip What that something was no pen is yet allowed t" l"it to paper, for Import ant p#* rsoii a a - were involved Inimedi atel> afterwards an important diplo mat:'- p. rsot:aarrived posthaste from i Britain. There are many who believe 1 to tDif day that the secret visitor was no less a person than Sir lOdward Grey. He arrived on Sunday morning and disappeared the same l ight. The time Is not yet for the publica tion of the true story of those critical days. Sufli.e it to s.-v that rumor happily, ill founded- arose to the eft. that tierman troops had crossed Dutch, territory. The Krciich found a d??ctt ment on a captured German otlleerj which appeared t<> prove the assertion.; This is 'he tlrst incident relating to the war with which the Dutch orange book deals. The. < outmander-in-cliict of the Dutch army, General Snyders, insti tuted an iii'iuiry. The r?siiU proved that German troops had not crossed Dutch territory. That was the flsstj danger safely passed. The orange book has much to say on the subject of the British naval measures and ihe German submarines. Minister Loudon is a master of detail.; lie never allowed to pass a single at tack on Dutch rights. lie protested j i vf*I*\ titiic*. k<*pt prott*. liiiK. never allowing himself to be drawn a! hair's breadth from the point at Issue.! Moreover, lie tooli full advantage ot j ihe fact that the sympathy of Holland was of great import, both to Britain and to Germany. and thereby got con-; cessions from both. The British order in council of Ocio-', her -!?. 101-1. created grave ditllctiltics j for Holland, the country being, for thoi most part, dependent on oversea sup-, plies for manufactured articles and ; raw materials. The British government j tiled to Induce Minister Loudon to give! oflleial guarantees that supplies tin-, ported should not be sent to Germany.) Minister Loudon refused point blank. > \(>nioiomion'i't"ox'rii tin TO in Till .XIOt'THA IilTV ( lie points out in the orange hook that such an agreement would be con-! trary to Dutch neutrality. Another] crisis arose. It was solved by the I establishment of the Netherlands over-1 sens Trust. The trust is a combination of all the leading commercial houses in the Netherlands who give what the Dutch, as a. nation, cannot give?a col lective. guarantee that goods imported shall not be re-exported. The trust started work in tlie fall ,,f last year with seven clerks. To dav it has over -100, and its system has heen copied in other countries. (jerman submarines were a prolific source of anxiety to the Dutch in the cnrlv days of the war on commerce. The Dutch arc a practical people. They were the tlrst to paint the names of their ships In large letters. Never theless, two Dutch ships were sunk and others were subject to aerial attacks, jonkheer I.oudon protested. He was polite, but forceful. The orange book describes the note addressed to Berlin ns "an emphatic protest," and adds that die German government was asked to state whether the series of attacks rep (Continued on I'ngc.)

I It is indeed true, as the liquor men. state, that atilidrink sentiment has risen and fallen in this country, like a wave flashing on the sand and then re-j treating for about 100 years. The flood tide of ls;in was not the first one. The first great movement for tem perance was seen a century ago. Moral ? suasion was the reliance of the re-j formers, and tin* force of the move ment soon died out. There is observable in the prohibi tion movement a 'onsiant tendency to' get closer to the seat of the trouble.; First the drinker was attacked. Then I the liiiuor dealer was the object of as-' satilt. and to-day the "drvs" are after! the manufacturer, the brewer, the dis-' tiller and the interstate dealers tooth and nail.

[Special Cable to The Times-Dispatch. 1 HKRI.IN, December 1!.?"Knormous estimates of the number of shells tired by 111 allies on the western front in their last great drive are given by Eng lish. French, German and neutral newspapers," says lieutenant-'leneral Kohne, on,* of the foremost Herman artillery experts, in the Vossische Xeitung. "Tin- Berliner Tagehiatt claimed that during tli?? tl?r? ??? days of the bombard ment in the Champagne '.?oo.OOO shots were tired every hour. This would mean 50,000,000 shells in seventy-two hours. The estimates of the Paris and London papers vary between 10,000.000 and X0,0"0.000 shots. t>nt these guesses are far out of the way. "The proof thut the estimates men tioned arc all wrontr can easily be fur nished. General .1 off re stated in his order of September '-1 that 2.000 heavy and field guns would blast the way through the German lines. The French oomtnander probably exagger ated, so as to encourage his troops, but even if he really had concentrated 5,000 guns. they could not have thrown nearly the number of shells that is said to have been tired. "After r.Oo shots, a gun becomes so hot that it needs a long time to eool off. Kven in the most favorable cir cumstances, a gun cannot discharged 1,000 times in twenty-four hours. The : best average for field guns Is TOO shots a flaj : for the smaller heavy cannon r,0'?. and for the largest pieces, ."<00. Taking these figures as a basis, I can positively state that the French cannot have used more than 3,100,000 shells on the twenty-mile front on which they tried t? ? break through. "Kven with the aid of the American ammunition factories, the allies could hardly have had the Srt.ono.OOft shells which they are supposed to havu used . up. The French factories and arsenals, according to <1 statement of the .Min ister of Munitions, are aide to produce: :<00,0tiii shells of all sizes a day. It ; would, therefore, take them more than tive months to manufacture 50,000.000. and in order to a< cumulate this enor mous number of shells, the artillery would have to stay inactive almost . half a year, while, as a matter of fact, the French have been so active with 1 their guns all the time that they not ! only used up the product of their own j factories, but also a very large part of the shells furnished to them by ncti- 1 tral America."

This organization is tlie official representa tive of the t'reusot works and all the . other iron and steel manufacturers of France, and the medium through which the l-'reiich government is now secur ing large quantities ot war munitions for tiie use of the French and flus sian armies.

I say this is un fortunately true because 1 realize that 1 we will 1m- working for the next twenty years to pay what we owe. Not ' before that time can we begin to put ! any profits in our own pockets. The ' fear that so soon as the war is ended the manufacturers now busy making arms and cannon and shells will con vert their factories into the making' ot products to compete with Yours is i unbounded. "While we French iron and steel men have been doing surprising work in our ' munitions, while we are turning out more than the Knglish factories, while I our people have shown n marvelous t example of improvisiou, while we have d..ne all this with our best plant* and our mines in the hands of the ibr- ; mans, we are not superhuman.

Stevens, of St. Louis, former Washington cor respondent of the St. Louis C.lobe I'etnocrat, ami later secretary of the Louisiana I'uichasic Kxposition. Mr. Stevens's theme was "Lincoln ami Missouri," and lie made [>ut)lic, possibly for the first, time, a letter whieh President Lincoln sent to Gen eral Steele, whose military district in cluded the State of Arkansas. The letter is dated .January I'O, l*t',l, and, said Mr. Stevens in his address, "is an answer to the historic ?! controversy as to the course Mr. Lincoln would have pursued had he lived out his sec ond term." The origimil of the letter is now In the collection of \V. K. Bixby, of St. Louis. "In his letter," said Mr. Stevens, "the President authorized the organization of a State government by an election on the condition "that it be assumed at said election, and thenceforward, that the Constitution and laws of the State, as before the rebellion, are in full force, excepting that then; shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except in the punishment of crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted; but the Ceneral Assembly may make such provision for the freed people as shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent. as a temporary arrangement, with their present con dition as a laboring, landless and homeless class.' "The language as to freedom." said Mr. Stevens, "is the same as was in corporated in the (hirteenth amend ment to the Constitution of the United States nearly two years after this let ter was written by Mr. Lincoln, tien eral Steele was ordered to proceed with the election, allowing all to vote who would take the oath of allegiance prescribed in the President's proclama tion of I ?eeember ' S, LSfi.'l, Polls were to be opened and the election on this channe in the Constitution and for Governor was to br conducted in ac cordance with the laws of Arkansas, tieneral Steele was instructed to have the votes counted and to recognize the new Coventor and to declare the Con stitution as amended in full effect. \otiii.m; said ix i.iriTi:n Y HO IT \ I'M. It (k S| KI;'lt.\tiK "In his own words, written by him self. ihe President expressed his pur pose to make the way for the Con federate States to get back into the Union simple and expeditlous. Xoih ing was said about negro suffrage. Mr. Lincoln pledged himself to accept 'any provisions which ma> be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of such State which shall recognize and declare their per manent freedom, provide for their edu cation, and which may yet be consis tent as a temporary arrangement with 'heir present condition as a laboring, landless and homeless class." The address of Mr. Stevens to-night began with the conference between Lincoln and Francis P. lilair, of St. Louis, at Springfield. 111., in April, 1S57. and closed with the message Lincoln sent through Clair to Ceneral .Joseph C. Shelby ami the Missouri Confederates, a few weeks before the surrender of Lee. In the letter to Ceneral Shelby, said Mr. Stevens. Lin coln offered the aid of the Federal government to the Confederates west of the Mississippi Uiver to march t<> Mexico ami join Juarez, who was fighting the French under Maximilian. "The relationship between Lincoln and Missouri was continuous from the conference with I'dair in I ,s T. 7 to the message sent Shelby in I S>said Mr Stevens. "It was intimate it had a deciding influence upon national poli tics. It had no small part in the for tunes of the Civil War. "In the spring of IStJO came fruition of the Lincoln and Missouri relation ship.
