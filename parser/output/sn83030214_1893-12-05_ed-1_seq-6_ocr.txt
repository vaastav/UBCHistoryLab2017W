MESSAGE Thc Presldenl surprises, In whal he soys ami in whal lu- does nol say. His prudent and con? servative friends, who bolted Ihai be would re gani Uie depressed conditlou "f business, aro surprised. Y'-i h.- does nol derote his ?-niii--? message to the tariff, as when Congress had im power t" settle thc question, lt is :i chilling message for Industry. Thc flrsl snowstorm and tin* message appropriately came together, to warn people thal a hard winter is coming. Bad ,-is thc Wilson bill is. thc Presldenl commends it as thc fruit ol' "much patriotic and unselfish work," believes thal ii "deals with the subject as consistently and thoroughly as existing con? ditions permit," and Insists thal the people have ordered Congress to make a radical change in lin* tariff, anil iliiit "failure will be clear recreancy " to duty. i'm* :i full .var Democratic manufacturers iimi workingmen have been consoling them? selves iviih lin* assertion, so often repeated, thal the President would never favor a change of tariff which would prostrate American Indus tries. They have sahl thal be w.is too con? servative .-uni prudent a niau 1" favor such changes when Hie business of the country was prostrated, and in no condition to "stand an ad? ditional strain. Yet he commends to Congress a bill more r-nli--.il by far than mosl Democrats ever expected t" sec reported. Plainly they have been mistaken In him, for be ls one of tli"-.- who persuade themselves thal even thc in...-! violi-nt cbauges, if in the direction of Free Trade, will harm nobody. The manufacturers ?f ile* country know better, and thc working men know better, and gave Ihe Presldenl iln-ir warning In the elections ?>f November. Hut be flays no more attention than he would pay to ih.- sighing "f the latest autumn breese. The President even approves in advance nu 'Income tux derived from certain corporate In rest men ts." declares such :i tax "not only nb mlutely just .-ind easily borne," but one whirl) -.in be remitted without business disturbance. li is nu", he supposes iimi thc proposed turiif, sitb th" present Internal revenue laxes, will In lu* near future yield additional reveuuc, and -ecommenda an iii<-..ni<. tax only " to provide for a temporary deficiency." Bul he does nol iceni to grasp Ihe meaning of the Treasury re ions which he submits. Regarding these, be ;ays that tii<- estimated revenue for Ihe current rear falls short of i stlmated expenses by .vis. 100,000. As ti-., decrease In revenue for only Ive months bas been over $.'il,000,<ss>, tin itatemenl seems singularly oul of place in such i stat" paper. The present law, under Demo ?ratio conduct, yields less by aboul $70,000,000 early than it did lasi year, and the proposed ariff will mt off, according to Chairman wu ion. about $50,000,000 >carly from lasi year's -avenue. Ii is nol to thc President's credll thal ic avoids tin* problem thus presented. The President might bare gained dlfferenl deas from a study <>f th.* post.-ii returns, which, ie s;iys, show :i deficiency of $r-tOOO.oou for Ihe ?ear Instead of an estimated deficiency of 1,500,000, alni :i probable deficiency of $8,000, hui fm* thc next year instead of an estimated in-plus of $872,000, Yel be urges an exten i"ii of the fi'-.- delivery service. Thc silver ill recently passed he pronounces satisfactory ml far-reaching, bul thinks ii yel unknown tiiat other legislation may i><- expedient, and bercfore recommends further delay. In the ame breath bc urges a provision for the Issue f bonds, whirli would foi.upon Congress tbe uestlon whether the bonds should bc made ;iy:iiiii> in coin or In gold. Mosl properly he rges thal economy In expenditure is necessary i lin- depleted condition of Ibe Treasury, but vldently has little hope that the appropriation rill lu* much reduced. Economy comes to thc front In his considers on of naval affairs. After a merited but brief impliment to the condition and progrsM of io new Xaw, bo asks Congress to "take Into inalderatlon thc depicted condition "f the rcasury." Presumably be has tbe same lougbt In mind in urging that distribution ot I.- seeds by the Agricultural Departmenl should * stopped, th" cos! being $135,000 yearly. A null larger plaster for revenue deficiency ls iggcstcd in his approval of tbe wholesale sus ?tulon of thousands of pension payments on io mound of alleged "gigantic frauds." Prea lent Cleveland has ncrer explained bow his euston Commissioner Blade happened to be ie mau who iln-w tin- larges) pension for dis illlty while holding a fal Government office, it perhaps no explanation was needed, in its treatment of nearly all domestic <|ii'-s ms, lin* message is creditable in character, it more verbose than is usual for Mr. Cleve* ml. ami in tho main reasonable in its mg< ?stioiis.

Ths Herald! rIvs me tin* lirst In? timation of it," said S'-cretary Gresham to mt* tO-Ilifillt. Immediately preceding this statemenl is the correspondence published In all thc morning papers on Monday between Mr, Van Alon and Secretary Gresham and Mr. Yan Alen and thc President. Prom this it appears thal on the ?.nih of November Mr. Van Alen senl to Beere tary Gresham a long communication containing his declination of thc ott ?<? of Ambassador to Italy with his reasons therefor in detail. There is no doubl Ihai Secretary Gresham had official ami personal knowledge of this communication and of ile- declination ii contained, for on thc 2-Jd of November President Cleveland writes t" Mr. Van Alen in these words: "'iii.* Secretary of Slat" has submitted to ino your letter of the 20th inst., etc." It is consequently Impos sibli* that Secretary Gresham was Ignorant <>f Mr. Van Alen's declination, or Ilia! In* gol his first iiniiiiiiii.f it from "'Iii" Herald" Sun? day night. Wc approach with some hesitation tin* ques timi which Inevitably rises, lt is a plain i|ii'-s lioii of veracity. Wi- il., mt Uk.* to entertain th.- suspicion for a iii"iii"iit that tin* Washing? ton iorii-|i"iiii"iit of "'lin- Herald" has manu? factured this story out of whole cloth; that thc Secretary made m. such averment, but the correspondent Invented H.

It is well known, of course, that in iii" ni"-t in:;i--rt.'i;ii affair which th.* Administration his taken in hand bc restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy Seen* ian- G rt sham has made our cotitemisiran his most trusted confidant and thc dc|iosltnry of the mosl Intimate secrets ..f Ibe department. -Vint ii iniv al-" be said Ihat, although the il.ness of this relation gave lt faculties for parly Intelligence which made '-The Herald" ih- envy of Ihe whole newsjMijier press, lhere lia- i>'-di ii" complaint of unequal distribution if favors. ** Tho Herald " t"i ii_r the only news imper of Import .ince supporting the Hawaiian |..iln-y of lin- Administration if i- suspected, In tact, by attentive renders of "Thc Herald" that ih-- policy was Invented In timi tiltlce Ihe lust iee nf the special rceo-cnltion was irew -rally nliiiiti"'l.

These new "assess? ments" are "absolutely Just and easily borne," and can be "remitted without unfavorable busi? ness disturbance" when the times are better. Who would fancy from the President's soft, mellifluous tone that he was reviving the most odious of the war taxes? The President's hand has lost its cunning. He has not succeeded in inventing a new catch phrase in his message. Is lt possible that Mr. Cleveland had Josiah Quincy In mind when he spoke of the "covert as w. ll as open hostility of spoilsmen" to Civil Service Reform? Or was lt Logan Carlisle? Or perhaps Maxwell? It ls hardly necessary for me to state that tho questions arising from our relations erith Hawaii hui.- cms .1 serious embarrassment?(Tbs Prert** lent's Message. They have, indeed; and not embarrassment merely, hut loss of prestige ami shame. But all this has come since March 4, since Mr. Cleve? land meddled with a completed act of his pre decesaor which it was his plain duty to let alone. There was no embarrassment till then, nor any Iblng except honor and advantage.

Question for th" next regular meeting "f the teform Club: "Who are the 'ninny self-constl ited guardians' of Civil Service Reform referred . In the Message, and In what does their tuerulous Impra UcabHlty* consist?" Th-* President expresses the hope that "the lends of tariff reform" will "subordinate per? illa! desires and ambitions to ths general .l." They undoubtedly will. If there's any iiii-; "the friends ..f tariff teform" pride them lives .-ii it ls a willingness to "subordinate i .md ambitions." That ls iher fellow's "personal desires and ambitions." Th" pr lent tu ition differs somewhat from tat "f the opening of Congreaa two years ago. hen Democrats and Mugwumps wera hunting tr "tie* lorie of the situation." In this one tere seems to be no logia to hunt for. When tho President made h's first Free Trade I'loti iii li-.? it was nit an economic .-ry but a situ.iii.in "f surplus revenue that ii;,- nii-l bim.
