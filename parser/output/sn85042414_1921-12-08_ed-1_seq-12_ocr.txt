It will do away with all waste in the potato-rais ing industry, for it will give the farm er a market for culls, small potatoes and frozen potatoes. All potatoes can be sold, regardless of shape or size. Freezing does not injure the starch in the potatoes, so the farmer will not have to suffer that loss. It will mean, therefore, a ready market for wha: heretofore has been unmarketable. Then. too. it will standardize the potatoes which are shipped to other centers for table use. It will mean Grand Forks is peculiarly well sit uated for such an industry. It is in the very heart of the potato-raising dis trict of the northwest, and it has ad mirable facilities for shipping the crop.
