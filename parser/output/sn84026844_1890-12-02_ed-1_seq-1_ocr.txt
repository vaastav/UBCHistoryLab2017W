I.?lividon ly tho President understood that 1 would have tlio support of tlio Uepubl can Senators for the passage of tho Fci cral Elections bill, which accounts fi the strong ground taken in tho messa) for tlio immcdiato enactment ol tin measure. Tho message liad only hee read heforu the Senate when tho Ilepul ]ican managers arranged for a caucus I discuss means to carry out tho sugge tionsot tlio President on tho subject i ? national election law. Tho result i that caucus establishes tho fact that a effort will ho made to havo the pendin hill passed, if not before tho holidayi Ht least immediately after. Tho caucus discussed two featurcE Tho immediate changing of tho rules, t bo followed at oucii by the passage of th bill, and tlio advisability of endeavorin to pass tho hill, and then, if ft failure ri suited, to ctiaugo tho rules aa a matter c necessity. The latter plan was tho 011 favored by the conservatives, anil th ono finally adopted, in ore were only lew Republican Senators who appeare to havo any objection to the lattc scheme, and an such it became the sens of the caucus. In fihort, the Republica Senators will give the public to undei stand that a change of rules first become necessary before any such attempt wil be made. The federal election bill, wit! this understanding, cornea up in th Senate to-morrow morning. The ilgb will thuB begin over again just where i stopped when Senator Quay made an ai rangement with the Democratic Sens tors. The Democrats will use ever; ellort to defeat the bill, and then maki the effort to defeat any change of rule lhat maybe proposed later on. The; -say thej' can do this. With J.he Republicans practicall, mnited in Ike Senate, and with the lev -erage furniflhotl by the Administration the Democrats havo now a much harde contest on hand thau the one of lae summer. It now looks possible to pae the Elections bill, and the liepubhca: managers behind it are very delei mined. house caucus. About thirty of the Republican Rej s-esentatives met in the room of th Committee oc Appropriations.

The probabilities of the Jiepubl cans having a quorum of their own men bers entereu largely into the diecugsioj and while some members expresoe doubts, the majority were sanguine th the party jcould secure & Jull attendant of members if necessary.

JJHJ! r in our present financial system is its it lack of elasticity. Tho national-banking 8 system supplied this defect to some q extent by the authority which the .. banks have to increase their circulation m01 in times of stringency, and to reduce crefl when money becomes redundant; but, ven: by reason of the high price of bonds, bain this authority has ceased to be of much The e practical value. cate y The demand for money, in this noun- ' try, is so irregular that an amount of circolatica, which will be ample during N j ten months of t^e y.car, will frequently 0|jtf ,3 prove so deficient during tyje other two ^ 1 months as to cause stringency anH comipejcial disaster. Such stringency may oth< n OQCur without any speculative manipu- don lationao/money, though, unfortunately, Sup [< it is often intensi?ed by such manipula- dele v tions.

New York, Dec. 1.-?The Fosl Bays: 1 Money on call at the stock exchange f was 5 per cent this morning and gradu- j ally advanced to 14 per cent until 12:30 , o'clock, after wliich it was down to 5 1 again by o'clock. There was nothing to indicate that there was auything artificial about this wide range. The fact is that there was unusual demand for money to-day in connection with the 1 heavy settlements on the first of the i month in all lines of business. But the t settlement of taxes|in Brooklyn alone re- i quired several millions for use in the 1 next few days. All of the leading stock i houses had foreseen the probable de- i maud for money about this time and had borrowed ahead. It is, in fact, the balances of brokerage houses instead of thOBO of the" banks which have sup- ] I plied the call loan market on sttock ex- chaugo in the last week. There is, how- j ever,: reason to expect a much' easier ' njar^et for pajl loanQ before many* days. j PoniMjlvouiti ISuuk ITuiUiro. > Indiana, Pa., Dec. l.?The Indiana Deposit Company closed it doors to-day as a result of the failure of B.

American legislation should conserve and defend Anioiicnn trailo and the wugea ot American workmen. Equality ot representation and the parity ot the olectora mu6t bo maintained,or everything that is valuable in our system ot government is lost. To the Senate aitil Home of Iltprucntativa: The reports of tho several executive departments which will bo laid before Congress in the usual course will exhibit in detail tho operations of tho Government for the last llscal year. Only the more important incidents and results, aud chielly such as may be the foundation of tho recommendations I shall submit, will bo referred to in this annual message. The vast and increasing business of the Government has been transacted by the several departments during the year with faithfulness, energy and succees. The revenues, amounting to above four hundred aud lifty million dollars, have been collected and disbursed without revealing, so far aB I can ascertain, a single case of defalcation or cmbezzloment. An earnest effort has been made to Btimulate aseneo of responsibility and public duty in all oflicers and employes of every grade, and the work done by them has almost wholly escaped unfavorable criticism. I speak of these matters with freedom because the credit of the good work is not mine, but is shared by the heads of the several denartments with the great body of faithful oflicere and employes who serve under them, rhc closest scrutiny of Congress is illrited to all methods of administration md to every item of expenditure.
