I-OUIS LETTEB. traveling Men Organizing a. Mam math Club Purity .of Mississippi Water Cheap Turkey. St. Loots, Mo,, December 5. There is not anywhere in the United States a club house owned entirely by commercial trav elers and devoted to their uses, but there will be .one as soon as the handsome building nnw being planned by architects, for the Travelers' Protective association, is erected in St Louis. It will cost half a million dol lars and will be the swellest place of .the sort outside of London, both as to its exterior appearance and its appointments inside. One novolty in the arrangements of .the club, which has been proposed, is to be a cab service. The club is to own its cabs, and they are not only to be at trains for use of members, but they are also to be at the beck and call of any of them who may want to drive about the city. The rapidly flowing water of the Missis sippi river has swept away the theorists who begun when the cholera scare ran over the country th;s year to exhort the people to drink only water that had been boiled. At that time, of course, St Louis took all sorts of sanitary precautions, which, by the way, are still in effective operation, and among them warned those who lived in the tene ment districts not to use well water. Every body then resorted to hydrants. About this time arose theory of the medical men who in sisted that all running water must be boiled if the drinker would prevent the coming of cholera, typhoid fever and other disagree able visitors of that kind. Everyone knows how difficult it is in rf household to boil all the water that is used by a family, and care ful folks sighed as they went about the new duty thus laid on them. Fortunately, about this time, a party ot microscopists from the Smithsonian institute visited St Louis. They were examining the water supply of all the large cities. They found that the river wa ter used in St Louis was not only pure bur wholesome, and they promptly announced that, adding that it was better than that of any other large city where they had been. The St Louis Medical society wanted to be sure that the Eastern scientists were right and appointed a committee of microscop ists from its own members to examine the water. The examination was made this week, ana the conclusion reached was the same as that announced by the Smithsonian institute men. The housekeepers are overjoyed, and the troublesome water-boiling in the kitch ens all day long has ceased. Here is a bit of information for the house keepers that will make them all want to live in St Louis. Turkey on Thanksgiving Day sold in the markets here for 15 cents a pound, and fresh venison for 20 cents; and there was much more of both kinds of the meat than could be old, judging from the appearance of the stands late that night 2vot only on Thanksgiving Day, but all the year round, housekeepers in other parts of the country hive good reasons to envy their sisters here. St Louis is m the center of enormous natural game and fish preserves. The hunting and fishing clubs of the city are numbered by hundreds. During the eight months of the year, fish is abundant on the market stalls- at insignificant prices, and for the other four months, game is real ly cheaper than good beef. The mechanic here lives as well as the professional man of moderate circumstances in New York, Bos ton or Chicago. A comparison of house keepers' figures would show that the cost of living is 25 per cent cheaper here than in either of those cities. . Effect on Gould Stocks. The death of Jay Gould was generally known on Wall street before the opening of the stock exchange, and brokers and traders had a full opportunity to prepare themselves. The effect on the market was less than ex pected, Missouri Pact Ho having declined only lf to 54, Western Union X to 85, Man hattan X to 1.23. These are stocks known as the Gould properties and Gould has de Toted his attention of late years to their management to the exclusion of everything tee. The Union Pacific, another property which he began again to pick up a year ago, fell off tf, and the general market was steady to firm. Dealings at the stock exchange were aU tended with comparatively little excitement after the first ten minutes of business, and the board room presented nothing unusual ia its appearance, either in point of num ber of brokers in attendance or in any other respect Even the so-called Gould stocks were only moderttely active.

Ruth Weaver,' daughter of General Weaver, lato oresiden tial candidate, was married at Des Moines, la., to Harvey Denny, of that city. The wedding was witnessed only by friends of the family. Stocks' Stepping Stone. Fred A. Stocks, of Kansas, chief clerk of the treasury, has been appointed by the president a member of the board of control of the government's exhibit at the world's fair. In this position he represents the treasury department, as the board is composed of one representative from each department. He succeeds Gen eral Nettleton, who represented this depart ment on the board uhtil his resignation as assistant secretary. Internal Revenue. The total collections of internal revenue for the first four months of the present fiscal year were $56,258,020, an increase of $4,332,752, compared with the collections during the corresponding period ot tne last fiscal year. Cancerous. Emperor William is said to be suffering from cancer in the ear; a simi lar affection to the cancer in the throat of which his father, Emperor Frederick, died. Circulation.

A gentle man who is classed as a close personal friend of the president is authority for the state ment that General Harrison will form a law partnership next March with Attorney Gen eral Miller and others as advisory counsel, appearing in court only in very important cases, and that he will spend several months in European cities next year studying their industrial conditions with a view to writing a book on the subject A Governor Indicted. Governor Flower, with other owners of property at Long Is land City, has been indicted for maintain ing a nuisance, in the shape of swamp lands and cesspools. She is Dead. Mrs. Rachel Fleming, of St Joseph, Mo., the wealthy real estate owner who was indicted by the grand jury on the charge of renting houses to immoral characters, is dead, as the result of injuries received in a runaway accident Money for the Commission Gives Out, Washington, D. C, December 6. The Cherokee commission wired the secretary of the interior asking if the commission should proceed to negotiate with the Creek Indians for that part of the reservation coming with in the limits of the instructions to the com mission. This brings up a serious question, cs the Creeks have expressed a willingness to open negotiations, and this opportunity has never presented itself before. They have persisted in holding all their lands, and as their reservation is made up of very fine land the commission is anxious and also the secretary of the interior to improve the op portunity to enter upon negotiations. So far the inquiry has not been answered for the reason that the secretary -is embar rassed in his efforts to find money with which to pay the commission. The funds have practically been expended, and how to continue) the work of the commission under this condition is a serious question. The chances are favorable, however, for the com mission to be withdrawn from the field and the chance to negotiate with the Creeks not improved. The Antl-Optlon Fight. Washington, D. C, December 6. The fight has already commenced on the anti options bill. Strong delegations arrived last week from New York. Chicago and New Or leans, representing the speculators. They came loaded with ammunition and are in close consultation with the seuators who are relied upon to represent their side of the case in the senate. Senator Wash burn is looked upon as champion of the bill. Representative Hatch is also expected to as sist in many ways in the fight C. Wood Davis, of Kansas, is here. As the programme is announced by the option dealers, they do not propose to have the senate take up the bill for some days. Senators Vest and White are being relied upon mainly to defeat the bill. It is confi dently asserted that they will resume the plan of talking it to death. They propose to spend the whole session in this ramn ha. fore they will permit the bill to pass. Some New Ideas. Washington, D. C., December 6. Repre sen'ative W. C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, is in favor of a departure from the custom in the matter of the preparation of the dem ocratic revision bilL He thinks it should be done under the direction of Mr. Cleveland. Mr. Breckinridge slid the people bad confi dence in Mr. Cleveland, and he thought Mr. Cleveland should, with the assistance of his cabinet, prepare the tariff bill to be sub mitted to congress, m lieu of a mere mes sage of recommendation. By this means a great de il of time and trouble will be save! Mr. Breckinridge said that he was opposed to the extr session. Semtor Palmer, of Illinois, favors the ex tra session, provided the democrats can reach a definite agreement as to exactly what matters should be taken up. He thinks the extra session should be confined to orgaaiza toin, appointment of committees and the admission of territories to statehood. The State Bank Plank. Washtnoton, D. C, December 6. The state bank plank in the democratic platform is likely to oe the cause of a good oeal more trouble than was anticipated by the conven tion which adopted it. Talks with a number of democratic representatives show that a great difference exists on tins question. Many democrats from the east and west are absolutely opposed to doing anything what ever with reference to state banks, while many representatives voicing the demands of their constituency for- a larger carreacy insist that the plank in the democratic plat form shall be given practical effect. Rep resentative Livingston, of Georzia, said that he was ia favor of keeping this and every other pledge given to the peopled The peo ple, as added, were aow tenying poUtios, mata nartv that did wsImm its weali he Is besiad at the ealk. 

ADTS SUIT. Judge Riner Throws -It Out of Court. The "Transmlssourl Association of Railroads Declared to Be in Ac cordance w!h Law and Equity TheXaw only Aiminar at Trusts. ToprrA, November 3a At the opening of the federal circuit court in this city, Judge Riner handed down his decision in the Traas missouri Freight association case. Tho action was a suit in equity, brought in the name of the United States by United States District Attorney Ady, under the direction of the at- torney general, to dissolve the Transmit souri -association, and enjoin the railroads composing the association from further par ticipation in it The court's decision was in favor of the railroads, dismissing the complainant's bill. The judge held there was nothing illegal ia the contract between the railroad companies composing the Transmissouri association; that the contract was not in restraint of trade or against public policy; that there was Homing iu uio cuuauii ituilu uciiicu any of the companies composing it of the exercise of all their corporate franchises. Ihe court also held that the act of July 2, under the provisions of which the bill was drawn, was clearly not intended by congress to apply to railroad companies or common carriers, but was only intended to apply to combinations, conspiracies and trusts in re straint of. trade, similar to thos: trusts which had been formed before the passage of the bill, citing the steel rail trust and others, as examples of the kind of combinations or trusts which the act was intended to apply to. 'Cabbell Defeated. Topeka, "December 1. The state canvass ing board .finished the count on the electoral icket The board 'held that the returns from Sedgwick and Wilson counties showed that theoiame-of E. B. Campbell had been re turned instead of E. B. Cabbell, (p. p.), and that the 6,000 votes cast for E. B. Campbell for presidentialtelector could not be counted for E. B. Cabbell. Attorney General Ives, the only people'-e party representative on the board, objected to this action, but the four republican members stuck to it and adopted the following, offered by Secretary of State Higgins: "Resolved, That the board of state can vassers has no legal authority to make any changes of the returns as certified by the various county clerks, nor has said board any authority to cail for or demand any amendatory or supplemental returns. That the duty of said .board is a ministerial one, and consists in tabulating the returns from the various counties, so as to show the result on presidential electors, state officers, mem bers of congress, and members of the state senate, where the senatorial district is com posed of more than one county. The re turns of legislative districts to be accepted as certified by the abstract of the county clerks, mere clerical errors apnarent at a glance may be corrected, but with this possi ble exception, the face of the returns covern in all cases where it can beascertained there from what the result is." To Restrict Immigration. New York, December L The senate com mittee on immigration met here. Previous to adjourning the committee con sidered the following proposition, without, however, reaching a conclusion: "All immi gration exnept from North and South Amer ican countries shall be suspended for one year from March 1, 1893, the law be framed as not to hinder the fres return of American citizens or the easy admission of visi'ors." It is believed the resolution will be parsed at to-morrow's meeting. It was decided that as tho danger of the coming of cholera dur ing the summer of 1893 was apprehended, to limit the present consideration of the re striction of immigration to a Question of to tal suspension for one year. The committee also decided that it was advisable to submit to congress for consideration a law embrac ing the following propositions: "That no immigrant shall be admitted unless vhe can read and write his native language, and un less he possesses $100 in money or its equiv alent; that intending im migrants shill bring with them certificates from United States consuls, showing that they have a right to gain admission as immigrants ; that all per sons beeking final naturalization papers shall give reasonable notice to the court and some officials representing the government shall investigate the facts upon the other side. Politlcal Reasons Urged. Washington, D. C, December L Con. gressmen are beginning to arrive in the city preparatory to the meeting of congress. All of them have views on the question of call ing an extra session of congress, the opinion being equally divided on both sides of the question. Representative Holman, chairman of the house appropriation committee, said that so far ""as the tariff is. concerned he thought much more could be accomplished by doing that work in the ordinary manner, and through the ordinary channels than by calling an extra session. He was not prepared to say that there would be a deficit that will de mand an extra session of congress. . Representative Livinzston. of Georgia, a democrat with alliance leanings, said the people wanted to know how long the rob bing under the McEinley act was going or. He did not see how an extra session could be averted. Representative Tarsney, (Dem.,) of Mis souri, believed an extra session to be a mat ter of policy. The democrats should pass their tariff bill in time to give it a fair trial before the next election, and not make the mistake the republicans did in going to the country on on unknown issue. About Rev. Dr. Scott. Washington, D. C, December L Not withstanding his 92 years Dr. Scott has en joyed exceptionally good health up to the lime of his last sickness, and his mental rigor saemed to have kept pace with his physical soundness. ReT. John Witherspoon Scott, D. D., was born in Beaver county, Pennsylvania, June 22, 1800, and was 92 years old. He was ason of George McElroy Scott, a native of Bucks county. Dr. Scott graduated from college at Washington, Pa., and subsequently took a post graduate course at Yale. Afterwards he accepted a professorship in the college from which he graduated, which position he he'd for two years. At this time he married Mary Nenl and accepted a profesorshiD in Miami university in 1826. While there three children were born to him. Elizabeth, after wards Mrs. Lord; Caroline, afterwards Mrs. Harrison, and John Neal 8cott A number of years later Dr. Scott founded the Oxford, Ohio, female college and in 1850 became its president As he advanced in years, Dr. Scott gave np college work and, coming to Washington, was appointed to a clerkship in the interior department, which he held until President Hamsun's inauguration, when he resigned and took up his abode at tho White house. All Optimistic Now. Bscssxtr, December 1. Nobody aow talks of the failure of the conference which at first was the only prediction made as to Ihe outcome of the meeting So rapidly has the optimistic feeling grown that it is re ported that the conference likely to con clude its labors next week. It was said last week that the session would last until after Christmas.

Springfield, O., November 3a All cf Ohio using natural gas is greatly aroused over the unmistakable evidences that the supply is slowly failing. The pressure in the great Mercer county fields has decreased from 400 pounds to seventy-five and eighty pounds, and new wells are being constantly drilled in what has been a discouraging effort to fulfill contracts to supply gas to cities on the big pipe line such as Dayton, Springfield, Sydney, Troy, Piqua, etc. To facilitate the distribution of gas, a new fangled force pump is beiug used to hurry the gas through the mains. All manufacturers have been cut off, and nothing larger than a hotel is- now sup plied with the convenient fuel. The pressure is getting so unreliable and variable that hotels are taking out their burners. The local officials of the comnanv nm rh'Rronr- aged over the prospect, and consumers fear they will have to return to the use of coal. Some are inclined to think that the large flow from tho big wells in Indiana, and the largely increased flow of it there, hare some thing to do with the pressure here. As Viewed In Europe. London, November 30. The Post, discus sing the currency question and the confer ence at Brussels, complains that Senator Allison is a representative merely of the sil ver party in the United States, and that therefore little can be hopsd for from the conference, as there will be no chance to discuss any practical arrangement to utilize silver as a subsidiary currency. Tho Vienna correspondent of the Chronicle says: "The American proposals in the Brussels conference, which began, with the bi-metalic programme rejected at the con ferences of 1878 and 1881, have caused disap pointment here', as they fail to supply a basis for a further discussion without raising hopes in the silver market. Rothschild's proposition is also regarded with animosity." Tapped for Irrigation. New Yore, December 1. Dakota scien tists express the opinion that tho Missouri river is drying up. The volume of water is gradually decreasing, and the river men are of the opinion that the large number of arte sion wells in South Dakota is the cause of this. They claim that tho artesian basin of North and South Dakota receives its supply from the Missouri, and the immense amount of water used for irrigation in South Dakota, and that taken from the smaller streams tributary to the Missouri in Mon tana for similar purposes, are what is caus ing the decrease. Old rier men think that it will be but a few years until steamboat traffic on the Missouri will be a thing of the past The President's Message. Washtnoton, D. C, December 1 Owing to bis present family troubles tho president will do unable to complete his annual mes sage to congress in time for submission to that body on the opening day of the session, as the indications are that, owing to the death of Dr. Scott, Mrs. Harrison's father, he will be precluded from making any pro gress whatever during the remaining days of the present week. The president will probably send a brief message to congress on 'Monday, explaining why the message is delayed, it is learned from good authority that it will be about the same length as that of last year about 15, 000 words. Precautions Relaxed. Washington, D. C, December L Act ing Secretary Spaulding has made a further modification of the regulations governing tne admission of immigrants. It is based on the report by Surgeon General Wyman of the Marine hospital service to the effect that it is safe to relax during the winter the ex isting stringent precautions against the in troduction of cholera. Under the new ar rangement all vessels from foreign ports regardless of whether they carry immi grants, will be allowed to proceed as far as the local quarantine stations at Philadelphia and Baltimore, without examination at the federal quarantine stations. Can Be Cured. Chicago, Decembor 1. Eighty head of cattle from the Riverdale distillery, several of which were hopelessly diseased from lumpy jaw, while the rest are perfectly healthy, or slightly affected with lumpy jaw, had been kept with the others to test the the ory of contagion and had been treated for from two to three months, were slaughtered. Of the first thirty not one showed the slight est sign of disease. All were passed upon by the government experts as absolutely satis factory. The cattle mildly affected had been cured, while the healthy ones had not suf fered in the least from the exposure with the hopeless cases. Qushlng Oil Well. St. Marts, O., November 30. One of the most phenomenal oil gushes in this country. was completed on the Hollister farm in Port age, Hancock county, and when the pay was struck the flow of oil became so strong as to hurl the drill from the hole. The first houi the well flowed about 2,000 barrels. The entire surrouodine country is being flooded with oil, owing to the company's inability to construct sufficient tanks. Canvass Commenced. The state board of election canvassers met at 10 o'clock Monday, in the office of the sec retary of state, at Topeka, and commenced the official count of election returns. The tabulated returns of Secretary of State Hig gins are being compared with the returns by counties, and it will take several days to complete the count. After comparing the returns on tho electoral ticket down to Chase county the board adjourned. Worthy and Welcome. New Yoke, November 30. Among the passengers landed at Ellis Island ware 200 Hollanders, who were bound for San Luis valley, CoL, where they are to found a col ony. Last summer they sent a representa tive to this country to buy land for them. He selected Colorado, and on his report they sold out their farms and came over. They are made up of families and are well supplied with money. In the Spring. Gcthbie, O. T., November CO. Senators Higgins of Delaware and Perkins, of Kan. sas, the committee from the senate to inves tigate the matter of opening the Cherokee strip, while here, stated that it was theii opinion that the strip would be opened early in the spring and as the committee thai would so recommend to congress. Eighty Men Walk Out. Tbot, N. Y., November 3a A large num ber of the machinists employed in the gun shop at the arsenal ia West Troy have struck.

The Senate Not Likely 'to Wart for a BUI to Originate In the House, But Will Rush Through a Senate Bill. WAssnraroK, D. G, December 2. Senator Piatt called on Secretary Noble and two boats were spent in the consideration of matters relating to territories and Indian affairs. The senator; as chairman of the committee on territories, has a number of nutters of importance in that line to be passed upon during the next session, and is second to Senator Davis in committee on Indian affairs. Senator Davis, during the last session, owincr to illness, turned most of the business over to Piatt, and it is under stood that Piatt will practically be chairman of that committee during the coming sea-" sion. The conference was taken up mainly in a discussion of a bill to ratify the treaty which will open to settlement the Cherokee strip. The senator is known to be enthusiastically in favor of the bill, and the friends of the meesure consulted him freely last session when political maneuvering in the house knocked it out It is understood that the senator favors an aggressive fight, and while ordinarily such measures from constitu tional reasons originate m the house and pass that branch before being taken up in the senate, he favors rushin? a similar bill through the senate early in the session, and by this means emphasize the fact that cen sure for tardiness and delay belong to the house and not to the senate. If the friends of the measure, accepi thii advice from the senator there is no doubt but he will rush it through the senate at the most opportune time. It can bo thoroughly relied upon that the republican senate will do anything possible to get the strip opsn to homeseekers, but at the other end of the capitol it is very uncertain what will be done. To Colonize Negroes. Topeka, December 3. A project has been placed on foot here for the colonization of American negroes in Brazil and other coun tries to the south. The scheme is of such Bcope that should it be carried out it will greatly change the political and industrial aspects of the United States. It is nothing less than for a concerted movement of the black race of the United States into the Latin countries. About eight years ago the Freedman's Re lief association was chartered in this state and Chief Justice Horton and many of the state officers were members of it The asso ciation was under the direction of John M. Brown, a negro who is now clerk of Shawnee county. He had recommended himself for the place by his work as leader of the "exo dus," when he helped 70.000 negroes from the south into homes and employment in the norm, xne ureeamans association was chartered for the purpose of inducing the settling of negroes in Brazil, but its opera tions were temporarily suspended for the reason that the emancipation of Brazilian slaves did not take place as soon as was ex pected. But Mr. Brown has now resumed the task of solving the race question in the United States by the only meai.s that appear prac ticable to him. The work is to be prose cuted by the Central and South American Emigration association, of which he is pres ident; S. W. Winn, secretary, and William narna, treasurer. All the officers are resi dents of Topeka and men of influence and capability. Mr. Brown is an unusually bneht man and a nood talker. He knows everything about the negro, from the beginning of history down to the f last southern outrage. He has studied all the plans that have been devised in behalf of his race, but he thinks the settling of negroes in lands where the laws, the social order and the climate are congenial is the only thing to strive for; and these conditions are found in the Latin countries alone. He says it is out of the question to tako negroes to Siberia or to the Congo valley on account of the ex pense, which is about $100 a head. Besides, there is nothing there for them no civiliza tion, no intercourse with civilized people. On the other hand, Brazil is just now tak ing ranic among commercial nations, and reciprocity and other considerations will tend to give it a rapid advancement. That country, which is ready to welcome the ne gro, offers a bright future, while Africa holds nothing for him but retrogression. Mr. Brown says that, from the Mexican line to Cape Horn, the country is opsn to negro immigrants, and it will cost only $8 a head for passage from St Louis to any Brazilian port Brazil alone has territory enough to make forty-six states like Kansas, and it is thinly peopled. The soil is fruitful, the climate just what the negro wants, and the government hospi table to the last degree, for there is no race prejudice in Latin countries. Mr. Brown does not think that the negro has anything to hope for in the United States. Every expedient has been tried in his behalf, but without avail ; it is impossible to settle the race question without dividing the races. The last effort made by tho government was thoroughly unwise, said Mr. Brown. The federal election bill, or the "Force bilL" was designed to give the negro his rights in national elections; but the ques tion of wages and bread and butter, the only Suestion in which he is interested, are set cd by the local courts and nob by members of congress. As long as the negro has no voice in local government justice and right must remain unknown to him.
