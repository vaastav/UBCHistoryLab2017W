T3ie Republican. WEDNESDAY, i>i,C. ■ •-< . OF WALES. The people of the British Dominions are very justly excited over the prob.- b’a approaching death of the Prince of Wales, el lest son of the Queen, an J heir apparent to the throne of Englmd. Prince Albert Edward, the second child of Queen Victoria, was born on theOth of November, 1841. lie was married on the sHhof March, 180-3. to the Princes* Alexandria, daughter of of King Christian, of Denmark. To them have been born five children, two eons and three daughters. The eldest son, who by the death of the Prince of Wales, becomes heir apparent to the Ihrone, was born on the Bth of Janua ry, 18G4, and is continently nearly eight years old. As by law the crown de geends in regular order to the children of the Prince of Wales, it will appear that there is no danger of the existence of a vacancy in the lino of succession. In the contingency of the death- of all issue of the Prince, the succession wo aid devolve on his brothers* But it is in the probability that exists of the the Queen notsurving long the death of her son, hence the necessity of '.he establishment of a regen cy lor the young King, th-at *is likely to lead to grave consequences in the British realm By law the Regent has the power without the name of a King Such an officer has often been appointed to exercise roy .l authority. It Mas been of somewhat doubtful is sue inhere the power, of appointing a regent sxisted. But of late years Par liament has exercised the function, which by gradual growth has become one of its prerogatives and the appoint ment of a regent will abide in it at this time should the necessity arise Should tho death of the Prince of Wales occur at this juncture of affairs in England, the inhabitants of the country who lean towards Republican ism would endeavor to make their in fluence felt, and perchance m ike an attempt at gaming power. Such be ing the condition of things at present, it is not unnatural that some anxiety is felt about the recovery of the Prince and that many sarnest prayers ar e offered up that he may yet live to sit on the throne of liis ancestors. We dc not liclievd that the English people are yet prepared to change their present sys.em ot government, but that there is a growing disposition among them fur greater freedom of thought and action is unmistakable, and stran ger things have happened in the his tory of nations, than for the people of Great Rattan never to witness again another King or Queen ascend the throne. Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. —Many earnest Republicans were led to expect in the make apjofthe new Committees in the Senate, that Senator Sumner, of Massa chusetts-, wound be re-asslgned to his position, as Chairman of the Committee Relations, from which he was removed- last year, to give place to Senator Cameron. Whatever disap pointment may have been produced by Senator Sumner not being given his eld place, it is an undeniable fact that great dissatisfaction is expressed over the retention of Senator Cameron as Chairman of this most important Com mittee-. a man who is admitted to be in ao way qualified for the position, and one who never lias yet hesitated about resorting to any means to advance his political interests. 3lany better and more fitting men are to be found in the Sena'e, and it is z strange hallucina tion that keeps Cameron in this prom inent position before the Country. For Postsraster of the Senate. —Mr. N. D. \\ right, of the Deluvan Republican , is mentioned as a candidate for Postmaster of the Senate the com ing winter. As the editor of a sterl ing Republican paper, and a competent person for the office, he is certainly deserving of recognition, an i hailing from a locality that can always be relied on for ro; sing Republican majorities, this considerations should also move the Senators in his behalf. Tin Senate can not do better than to cdect Mr. Wright Poscmaser the next session, Mr. Thiers has written a letter of Bongratulation to M. Juies Janin, upon the speoh made by the latter on taking his s-at at the Academy last week. In this letter the President expresses a wish and a hope that the Assembly will soon lemove back to Paris, and the government also-. Among the Deputies the opinion is gaining ground that the time has come when a return might be made to the capital in safety. The Wharton Trial.— The trial of Mrs,. Wharton for the alleged poisoning of General Retch urn, at Baltimore, is now taking place at Annapolis, and at tracting unusual attention throughout tiie country.. The evidence is strong against the prisoner, and it is thought that her conviction is certain. Alexis.—Prince Alexis is still on his travels through the country A grand banquet was given him at Boston, Saturday Evening last. The affair wa presided over by Robert C Winthrop *nd was magnificent in all its details. And now conies the rumor that the Democrats m Washington talk of trv ingto impeach President Grant, foi unlawful acts in r latioo to Sau Du uiingo.

The Doper c ATI 70s says an endless stream of help is pouring into the lum bering districts, and the demand by no means decreasing. Good help com mands the best of wages. Urban Willetts, a Frenchman, re siding on the Fort Howard Military Reservation, was found dead in his shanty, on Tuesday morning. A brilliant Meteor was observed at Madison, early Wednesday evening. Sixty buildings have been put up at Peshtigo since the fire. Mr. Cavoit has rebuilt his mill, putting in a port able engine, about four miles south of Peshtigo. A woman preacher, till lately un known to fame, has lately been adding greatly to her laurels in Fond du Lac of late. Many think she is an abler speaker than Mrs. Van Cott. At on? of Rosco’s famous performan ces in Madison, the other night, the Democrat says the main prize, a watch which cost 312 in that city, fell to Miss . elle Hall, a young girl about twelve years of age, whose family are in meager circumstances. The Janesville Gazette says; “One of our oldest residents left his happy home a few nights since for an ev ning of social pleasure, and on his return found that his wife, child and furni ture had eloped together during his absence. There y hangs a tale.” The Lodi Journal reports that last week a forged order was passed on James McCloud to the amount of 350 by a boy sixteen years of age, who claimed that his name was Erikson. ETe was arrested and committed to jail. The AA'ood County Reporter says: “Robert Blow last week had eighteen sheep killed by a valuable dog. Twelve were killed outright, and six were slaughtered to save their lives.” Jas.

FROM THE NATIONAL CAPITAL. Washington Dec. Bth, 1871. To the Editor of the llepnh'ican: Congress assembled on Monday, December 4tb. at t lw o’vlotk, noon, and after some preliminary business was transacted, listen ed to the reading of the President’s Message. This is a plain, sensible, business-like document, clear and terse in its style, and full of useful information. It opens with the statement that during the year, success has generally attended the effort to execut e all laws, and that the policy has been, not to enquire into the wisdom of the laws en acted, but to learn their spirit and intent and to enforce them accordingly. The different reports from the heads of departments are all quite lengthy ; the sev eral recommendations made and many points are embodied in the President’s mes sage. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury shows ihatjfrom March Ist, 1809 to December 1, 1871, the national debt has been diminished over 277 millions of dol lars, and the revenues largely >n excess of the estimates, being some 12 millions dol lars more than the previous year, while the cos of collection has been less The net receipts for the year were a little over 383 millions, and the expenditures a little over 292 millions; the estimates fur the current year are ; receipts 350 millions, expendi tures 300 millions. The report of the Postmaster General shows that the deficiency in that’depart mont is growing less every year, the rev enues getting larger, while the expenditures are getting smaller. The deficiency for the last rear is a little over 4 millions, and this deficiency will, it is expected, become gradually smaller especially if Congress should abolish the franking privilege. The adoption of the telegraph system by the government is strongly recommended, and the establishment of Postoffice Savings Banks, as in England, suggested as a means whereby to meet the expenditure. The larger part ol the report is taken up by sta tistical tables. The report of the Secretary of the Interior embraces the several bureaus under that de" partment, Indian Affairs, Land Office, Pen sion Bureau, Patent Office, Census Office and Bureau of Education Jt contains many interesting statement? and tables. 

CCNGBESS. The committees in Ilia House, to the sur prise of many, were appointed immediately upon re-assembling. The chairmanship of the most important one, Ways and Means, was given to Mr. Dawes, of Mass., while Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, was pat at the head of the committee of Appropriations. The former committee is considered in favor of revenue reform, 4 being high-tariff men, 4 free-trade men and 1 revenue-reformer, who consequently will bold the balance of power. Much satisfaction is expressed at the appointment of the Commute es, and everybody, for a wonder, seems to be well satisfied. Many bills have already been in troduced, and all the old ones have been properly referred. Congress has entered upon its work in earnest, and it is to be hoped that such legislation may be bad, as will benefit the country and prove a bless ing to the people. Many important hills are before Congress, and many more will be introduced ; nany of them, of course, will fail lo become laws, but those that do ought to be the very best ones. I notice the name of your member, Mr. Hazelton, on the Com mittees of Elections, and Expenditures in the Navy Department. \V. PRINCE OF WALES. London, Dec. 11—2 p. m.— The dispatch bearer who left Sandringham at 11,30 p m. told outsiders that he did not hops to find the Prince alive when he returned, and that the mem bers of the royal family and others have given up all hopes of his recovery. The only special bulletins of t. e con dition of the Prince issued to-day are the following ; •‘Sandringham, 8 a m —The Prince passed a restless night. There has been further recurrence of graver symptoms. His state continues precarious. Sandringham, noon. —The Prince is in the same precarious condi tion. The syraptons are unaltered,” Since the last bulletin was receives the telegraph line to Sandringham had been closed to the general public, be cause the wire was burdened with mes sage- to the Queen from charlatans, quacks and officious persons tendering med.cal advice. London, Dec. 12—3 p. :n — An un official telegram, dated Sandringham, I p. m., says it is evident, from the dis tress which prevails there that the last hours of the Prince are approaching Whole household has been thrown in to t..c deepest gloom by the words of a special“messenger who left the sack chamber shortly after noon, with dis patches for London, He declared uu re servedly that he did not expect to find his Royal Highness living when he returned" It is evident that all hope is abandoned. Prayers for the recovery of the Prince were yesterday offered in the Angelican and Roman Catholic church es, Jewish synagogues and dissenting chapels There is a profound and wide spread feeling of grief. Business is almost wholly suspended throughout the country Morning and evening papers issue extra editions every hour The official bulletins are surrounded by great crowds of anxious and silent peo ple. 3 P. M. —It is reported that, with one exception, the Prince has been un conscious since the first of the month Mlle. Nillson in Court.— The usual monotony of the Essex Market Police Court was disturbed, ye-terday, by the appearance of Christine Nilsson, who came to complain that Charles Theodore Busch has lately annoyed her exceedingly by forcing himself into her presence. She further stated that whenever she appeared in the streets he was always following her, and in fact seemed determined to be in her com panv whenever possible. The offender was in the court-room, and endeavored o prove to the Judge the faithfulness of his attachment by trying to kiss the hem of her cloak, but was prevented by the police sergeant. He had a very mxious aspect, and watched the beauti ful singer's movements with devoted attention. In default of bail he was -eat to the Isiand.—W. Y Tribune. ,<> * Antiquarians mourn the great loss of Warwick Castle, England, which was ecently burned. The space between he arches in the great hall were filled with precious relics of the M ddle Ages. Coats of mail dinted with blows of lamuus fields, crests shorn by Saracen -abre, swords that the hand of the King-maker bad wielded, and picture worth ali the gold that could bespread upon them, were gathered in one of he finest collections in Europe, and not one of them left. Ex-President Andrew Johnson is utterly opposed to the passive policy. He is reported as having said at at* in terviewer (Cincinnati Commercial) who examined him on this subject: “What is that but a surrender? A surrender is as bad as a defeat, and worse. It we nominate a Republican on a Republi can platform, what have we got to eon tent for ? No; that would benothing but a disgraceful fight for spoils; and, if suc cessful, there would be an everlasting wrangle. The Democratic party has a higher mission than to surrender iis principles in the hope of gaining a share of plunder. This plan is a Val lundigham departure on a large seaie, and is a farce and a fraud. What was the Vallandigham departure? It placed the Democratic party iu the position of whining curs standing on the outside, and saying to the Radicals inside. “Nrw you get out, and let us in, and we ll carry yonr plans, and get on your plat form. Only let u have the spoils, an t we’ll do just as you are doing.’ That was the Vallandigham departure- It was a proposed sm render of principle for place and spoil. There should i e no craven and cowardly surrender if the sort. Neve, in the history of the government has pure Democracy more to fight for than new. - Three of the United States Senators are between seventy and eighty years old. They are Davis, of Kentucky; Cameron, of Pennsylvania, and Vick ers, of Maryland. Nine Senators are between sixty and seventy, and twenty seven are between fifty and sixty. Four Senators are under forty, viz.; Ames, of Mississippi; Clayton, of Arkansas; Osborn, of Florida, and Spencer, ol Alabama. It will be seen that Old and not Young America predominates in the Senate. [Fiom tbe Crawford Democrat, Meadville Pa] Atlantic and Great Western Railway. So much has been said through the public press relative to the Atlantic and Great Western Railway, that we have been to the pains of inquiring, at head-quarters, the true status of the Company, ai.d the follow ing is the result of our inquiries: By virtue of legal proceedings in the States ot Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, the road and property of the Company from Salamanca to Dayton has been sold, and purchased by Gen. Geo. B. McClellan, lion. Allen G Thurman and VV. Butler Duncan, as trustees, for the benefit of creditors and stockholders, under a plan of re-organiza tion agreed upon by a large majority of the holders of stock and debts. In pursuance of the plan three new corporations have been organized in the three States through which the road runs. The three trustees are directors in each of these companies, and Gen McClellan atid Mr. Duncan are ap pointed an Executive Committee to take charge of and manage the affairs of the three companies, and operate the road un til the final consolidation of the three com panies shall take place. This will be ac complished as soon as the time required by the laws of the several States shall have ex pired for proper notice to the parties inter ested. Gen. Geo. B. Wright, of Columbus, Ohio, has been appointed the representative of the Executive Committee in personal charge of all the affairs of the Company on the line, and H. F. Sweetser, Esq., General Manager—and both these gentlemen are now at Meadville, Pa. in charge. It is ex pected that this general supervision and management will be continued after the consolidation of the three companies, but until this consolidation takes place and a board of directors of the consolidated com pany elected, no speculations or promises should be indulged in as to the future. Upon the sale ot the road the lease to the Erie Company terminated, and the road is now virtually in the hands of the stock holders, to be operat and by them for the ben efit of its lawful owners. In view of the complications involved in adjusting the affairs ot the company to the new order ol things, it is hoped the public and patrons of the road will exercise patience, and extend to ihe new management that confidence and snppoit which is needed and we think de served, believing as we do that eveiy possi ble effort is being made to put the road in first-rate condition and provide for the prompt movement of all traffic which may be offered. We understand no changes will at pres ent be made in the operating force employ ed, where efficiency and integrity is found and the greatest economy secured. Until the consolidation is perfected and the new Boaru installed the present mana gers will feel compelled to postpone action on many matteis pressed upon their imme diate consideration- but they wish it under stood that all communications will be filed and carefully considered, and as soon as pos sible, action thereon. Mr. John P. Horton has been appointed General Northwestern Passenger Agent foi ling Cos, with headquarter- at Chicago, 111. He will have special supervision of the bus.- ness throughout the West, and should be respected accordingly. It is reported that Senator Sumner will not accept the caucus assignment to the Chairmanship of the Committee on Elections. New Advertisements. [Established in 1830.]
