Mew, Dec. 10.— dis tress among the people of this city and throughout the slate of Durango, on ac count ot the drought, is on the increase. The suffering among the lower classes cannot be described It is a famine of the worst kind, and the pleadings and cries of the hungry horde for food are becoming more pitiable with each succeeding day. In a number of instances storehouses have been attacked by mobs of men, women end children, made desperate by the pangs of hunger, and robbed of corn. There are hundreds of people actually starving in this city, and there have been many deaths attributed directly to that cause. The state government several days ago contracted for 100,000 bushels of corn, and that order has now been doubled. The corn will come from Kansas. It is estimated that it will take no less than 1,000,000 bushels of corn and beans to carry the sufferers of this state alone through the winter and until next year's crops are matured. _ ', H. M.

BUTTE'S SMOKE UOW. It Comes Pretty Near General mc a Kiot. Special to the Globe. Butte, Mont., Dec. lfi.— For hours to day it looked as though a mob of deter mined citizens would march en mass out to Meaderville and tear to pieces the works of the Boston and Montana company. '1 ho city struggled between riot and law. but law finally won the day. Last night dodgers Hooded the city, c:i Jlintr the citizens to a mass meeting to be held in frout of the city hall. The city authorities, however, had al ready taken the matter in their own hands and late last night, having re ceived no satisfactory answer from President Bigclow, of the company at Boston, Mayor Mueller engaged Con tractor Winters to begin work in the morning in covering the five neaps wiiose sulphurous smoke has for a week been killing people in Butte. There was delay owing to failure to secure tools, and the mob again assembled at 1 o'clock. They were assured that work would begin aud dispersed. One hun dred and thirty-six men are ;;t work to night covering ihe heaps with dirt, and work will be continued day and night until It is finished. It is estimated that 75.000 tons of ore is burning. The state of feeling may be imagined from the fact that eight deaths occurred in the city today, and there were live funerals. During the first nine days of this month, when there was no heap resting, and no smoke, there were eleven deaths, while during the past six days, with the heaps burning, there have been twenty-one deaths. «o» A 

FREE COINAGE BILLi. Such a Measure Certain to Be Passed. NEW York, Dec. 10.— According to the World, it is pretty certain that a bill for the free coinage of silver in some form will pass both the Demo cratic house and the Republican senate during the present session. The plan practically agreed upon by those who will control the matter in the house is said to be briefly this: '•To stop all "purchases of silver by the government; to throw open the mints to the free coin a of all silver hereafter to be produced from American mines, and to guard against the unload ing of foreign silver upon us by a sys tem of notification and inspection simi lar to that devised for the guarding of the sugar bounties."

SAINT PAUL MINN., THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 17, 1801. TO REVISE THE RULES Speaker Crisp Names the First of His Numerous Com mittees. Ex-Czar Tom Reed and Julius Caesar Burrows Represent the Minority. President Harrison Presents the Names of Seven oftha New Judges. Democratic Caucus Commit tee Work Done—Naval Men for War. Washington, Dec. 18.— The opening of the house today, after the holiday of half a week, was without soecial inter est. It was generally understood that no business would be transacted, and that the meeting would b; merely a perfunctory one, to enable the speaker to appoint the committee on rules. Speculation was rife as to the composi tion of that committee, aud there was quite a large attendance of members, but their time was principally em ployed in conversation with applicants for minor positions, whom they po litely referred to the officers controll ing the various departments of the house. Speaker Crisp announced tiie appointment of the committee on rules as follows: The speaker, chair man; .Messrs. McMiiiin, CatchingS, Reed and Burrows. Mr. Chites. of Alabama, offered a res olution providing for the appointment of a standing committee on order ot business, to consist of fifteen members. Referred to the committee on rules. Mr. Taylor, of Tennessee, rising, said that it was bis mournful duty to an nounce the death of his friend and col legae, Hon. Leonidas C. Hunk, who died suddenly from accidental poison ing at his home in May last Mr. Tay lor delivered a touching tribute to the deceased congressman, and the bouse then, as a mark of respect to the mem ory of the deceased, adjourned till Sat urday. .ti< Jii!li;» Favor* Hills. The appointment of the house com mittee on rules is recanted by members of the house as a return to the former policy of appointing member- of this committee without reference to their other committee assignments. Mr. Mc- Millin, of Tennessee, who is one of the new members of the rules committee, is prominent as a tariff reformer, and was one of the most active members of the ways and means committee, lie says, however, that lie is in favor of the ap pointment of Mr. .Mills as chairman of the last-named committee. Mr. Me- Millin's selection as a member of the rules committee is ascribed to his par liamentary ability, his effectiveness as a debater and the fact that he is person ally very well liked by the members of the Democratic side, and will, therefore, be of great assistance in securing the harmonious adjustment ot any differ ences which may arise as to party pol icy. Mr. Catchlngs, of Mississippi, is a firm personal friend of the new speaker. and was one of the active maagers of his canvass. He is an experienced member of the house, an active worker and a clear, forcible speaker. Speaker Crisp said this afternoon that he hoped to be able to announce the house committees by Wednesday, Dec. 23, and that he expected the usual Christmas recess would not begin until that date.

COMMITTEE BERTHS. Democrats Long on Material and Short on Vacancies. Washington. Dec. 10.— The Demo cratic caucus committee held a long session this morning and practically completed its labor in the assignment of the minority representation upon the senate committees. It is impossible to learn definitely the places assigned to any of the new senators, but It is under stood that they have all been well cared for and have received more considera tion > than usually falls to the lot of those serving their first term. As an ticipated, Messrs. Kvle and Irby, Alli ance senators, have been treated as Democrats in tne programme as ar ranged, and so assigned, while Senator Peffer was left to the Republicans to care f9?i - rr - -^ Out of nine Democrats who enter the senate for the first time no less, than five are of national prominence— Hill, Viles. Ijjice, Gordon aud Palmer— and, ffi?Vefort£ deserve more than tjie usual averse or recognition. Qn the other ttsno, there are {ewer vacancies than u's'uaj, becdlis^ only five Den\o-' ciatlc Sefcatcra— Messrs. Wilson, jump ton, Brown, Began and Eustis — haw been removed by death, resignation or tlits legislatures. "There are fortunately three Democratic vacancies in the for eign relations committee, but there are none on commerce, none on judiciary, none on appropriations, none on privi leges and elections, none on public buildings and grounds and none on finance. It is not considered probable that Gor. Hill will be given a position on the foreign relations committee. This would be too much ot a concession tor the senatorial love of precedents to en dure. It is far more likely that three senators will be transferred from com merce and other leading committees to the vacancies in the foreign relations committee, and that Mr. Hill will be provided lor by these transfers. IX WARLIKE HUMOR. i j! Naval Men Favor Prompt Action Against Chili. Washington*, Dec. 16.— The navy de partment is in a warlike mood. It was stated about the department yesterday that the Chilians are delaying their answer to our demand for information concerning the Valparaiso incident for the purpose of gaining time so that their new war vessel, th« Captain Pratt, which will be the most formidable of their fleet; is completed. The situation thus outlined was discussed with eases j ness, and the opinion was freely ad« vanced that President Harrison would in all likelihood take measures to check* mate Chili in this matter by sending I special message to congress within the next two weeks reciting th< fact that explanation and rep aration had been demanded of Chili without avail, and proclaiming the necessity of inform ins Chili that this country will resort to extreme measures if the desired response is fur ther delayed beyond a reasonable and specified time. The wisdom of this course, it is ar cued, would be apparent. The Captain Pratt is now building in France, and cannot be finished in less than two months or more. In the meantime, if Harrison and congress should cause a declaration of war by the United States against Chili, it would prevent France from delivering the vessel to Chili, and won Id save New York and our other Atlantic cities from danger or bombard ment by that vessel.

Better Transportation Facili ties Needed by Western Producers. Yearly Appropriations of Six and Seven Millions to Bo Demanded. T7/0 Conventions as a Re3ult of the Lottery Differences in Louisiana. The American Federation of Labor Will Aid Pittsburgr Printers. Kaxsas City, Dec. 10.— Gov. Thayer called the river congress to order at 10:30 o'clock this morning. Mr. Berlin, a member of the Missouri river commis sion, said the first thing to be done was to obtain an adequate appropriation for tiie work. The commission had tought against local appropriations and t'le re port of the. commission stated that the -Missouri river could be made to answer the requirements of commerce, but enough money must be appropriated to finish the work. Gov. Francis spoke of the great im portance to the West of the improve ment of the Missouri river. The United States had assun ed control of the waterways, and it was criminal in the national government to neglect the great waterways. 'I he price of grain was axed by the cost of transportation. A cent saved in transportation was a cent mad^ for the producer. A cent added to the cost of transportation was a cent added, not only to the price of every bushel exported, but to every bushel raised. The state commission and the Missouri state law, in the event of the improvement of the river, would not only force the rates along the river down, but would also reduce all railroad rates in the state. Yearly Appropriations. A number of addresses were made and suggestions offered by river pilots. at the rlose ot which the report of the committee on resolutions was read. The resolutions demand an appropriation of 16.000,000 a year for the Missouri im provements, and $7,000,000 a year for the improvement ot the Mississippi. 'There was no manifest opposition to the adoption of the resolutions, bit a motion in adjourn until 2p. m. was put and carried. Tne resolutions came up for discus sion at the afternoon session. A motion was made by Mr. Leonard, of Kansas, that the section naming the size of the appropriation asked for be stricken out, bufc. this was defeated. Mr. Leonard then moved that section It, which was a little side bcom for the Hennepin canal, bo etricken out. Mr. Murphy, of lowa, a brother of "ilejine pin" Murphy, made a haruj fight for the. resolution and Mr. Corcoran, of Mis souri, came to his aid. Many speakers objected to it as out of place and it was finally stricken out. Mr. Murphy at once arose and left the hall. The reso lutions were then adopted without further debate. Col- S. (". Robinson, of Mississippi, is one of the most energetic of the dele gates. lie believes that the two big rivers are so closely united that the pood of one is the srood of both. He favors a permanent organization and the united action of all the people. It is only by such work, in his opinion, that the end can be reached. Hon. Jonas McClelland, of Sioux City, be lieves in reciprocity in river Improve ments as well as \a other things. A permanent organization was stren uously urged upon the people of the Mississippi and Missouri valleys, and have complete surveys of the river, in order that the government should know exactly what to do in the matter, was advocated. A committee on permanent organization was appointed, and this evening, after adjournment of the con vention, the committee reported, sug gesting that there should be an annual convention, with delegates selected as to the present one, and that work be done systematically in the matter of influencing the representatives from the various sections represented. THE 

LOUISIANA FIGHT. Two Conventions, Each Claiming to Be Right. Baton Rouge, La., Dec. 16— Democratic conventions assembled at noon today, each claiming to represent the Democracy of the state. Nothing beyond the usual routine business of or ganization was done by either body except the appointment of a committee oy the McEuery people to confer with the opposition, and ascertain what, if any. grounds of compromise could by reached. In the meantime, the anti-McEnery faction had a large trouble of its own to settle. There was a desire on the part of the anti-lottery men to abrogate the Lafayette agreement and bring about the nomination of a new-ticket, on which the farmers were to have part, but not the leadership. Several conferences were held with the farmers, but the latter refused to move an inch. Insisting upon the terms of the agreement and L. S. Adams for governor. The conven tion will, therefore, doubtless carry out the agreement, as a refusal would result in another division and a straight-out farmers" ticket. WILL AID TilK PRINTERS.

TELEGRAPH MRS WIN. Atlantic & Pacific Men Secure Their Demands. Albuquerque, N. M., Dec. 10.— The strike of the telegraphers on the At lantic & Pacific at this point resulted today in a victory for the strikers. The point the latter insisted on was that their organization should not be at tacked by the company and an increase of wages. When the telegraphers resumed their duties at tne key their first action was to flash the news of their victory across the wires. Responses were received from all over the country congratulating them. It is believed here that the, result of the strike will be a great benefit to the strikers on the Southern Pacific. On that road but four men refused logo out between £1 Paso and New Orleans. The schedule was signed at 4 o'clock, and at 4:05 trains began to move on the Atlantic & Pacific. The telegraphers claim to have secured every concession demanded. Five delayed passenger trains from the East will arrive here at 0 o'clock tomorrow. They were held at Triniaad on account of snow blockades. THE NEW FEDERATION. Sei'eral Railway Organizations May Not Join. St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 16.— Grand Mas ter Frank Sweeny, of the Switchmen's Aid association, was asked today what action his organization would take in the matter of the proposed new federa tion of railway employes, the plan for which was outlined by a committee here yesterday. He severely scored the advisory council of railway men for the action taken yesterday. "The switch men," said Mr. Sweeny, "already be long to one le.deration — the Supreme Council of Switchmen and Firemen.

"Am I for Palmer?" interrogated Mr. Springer in reply to the question put to" him. "I should say 1 am. lam a Palmer man every time." "1 would like to vote for Mr. Cleve land," said Mr. Durberrow. talking on the same subject, "but owing to the complications in the East it does not look to one as. though he could be* nom inated.

CREIGHTON IN IT? The Chicago Mail Driver Under Suspicion. Chicago. Dee. 10.— Today brought only faint clues to the perpetrators of last night's sensational mail robbery. One conclusion is that the robbers were of the expert class. It is suspected also that there were in the gang men for merly in the postal service. The booty is now estimated at 82.500. An interest ing statement is made by a woman who says that she saw the mail van turn Into the alley. She adds that she saw no robbers.

DOINGS OF GRANGERS Patrons of Husbandry Put in a Busy Day at North field. They Discuss Free Silver, but Take No Stand on the Question. Serious Accident on the Lan^ don Branch of the Great Northern. Nobody Killed Outright, bat Three Men Are Cut and Bruised. Special to the Olobe. Nobthfield, Minn.. Dec. 10.— The second day's sesion of the Minnesota State Grange was called to order at 11 o'clock to hear the annual address of the master of the order, James A. Bull, of Edina Springs. There were a few more delegates present than there were yesterday, a number having arrived on the evening and early morning trains. The roll call by the secretary showed that nearly a hundred delegates were in the room. Mr. Bull occupied the better part of an hour and a half, but even then he touched upon some topics more briefly than he had wished to. He summed up the work of the organiza tion during the past year, and dwelt at length upon some of the more interest ing features. He pointed cut the work that the organization was doing in its co-operative stores, and particularly em phasized the fact that the members of the grange were getting much good from them. He said that from reports sent in it was learned that those who patronized these stores were saving fully 20 per cent on their purchases, and that a number of new stores would be put in operation in a short time. Another matter that came up for liis consideration, and to which he devoted the major part of his address, was the school of agriculture and the experi mental station at the state university. He thought tlie members of the grange and the old patrons of husbandry could feel deeply gratified in observing tho good that these institutions were doing; as it was largely due to the grangers efforts that they had been started. The Committee on Plauiee or mure properly the committee on the financial conditions of the coun try, was the first to report to the state grange. The report was was an exhaustive one, and took up some of the more popular questions of the day. dealing with them from the granger's standpoint. The issue of free silver was also discussed, but no declaration either for or against it was made. Sam Adams, chairman of the executive committee, said later to your correspondent that,, to pre vent discord in the ranks, it was thought best to make no decisions on mooted questions. Politicians fish ing for votes will therefore have to be Boarded if they wish to capture the grangers. The committee on resolutions submitted its annual report, after which came the committees on by-laws and the good of the order. The reports of these two committees were meager and of interest only to members of the or ganization. The committee on organi zation had more to say. It incorporated in its report much that had been touched upon by Master Bull in his ad dress concerning the school of agricult ure and the experimental station, and recommended that his advice be carried out. An adjournment was to take place nt 4 o'clock, the remainder of the committee could not be heard, and will therefore report tomorrow. A memorial service then took place in remembrance of members of the grange who had died the past year. Two of the deceased were residents of Northfield. .1. J. Alex ander, who was a member of the execu tive committee, and master of No. 110. Sister Chamberlain was also a North field resident, and fitting tributes were paid to both. Tomorrow two members of the executive committee will be elected to take the places of Alexander and William Chowen. whose terms ex pire this year. The fifth and sixth de grees will also be conferred upon sev eral of the members. RAN OX A 

BIIOKISN RAIL. Three or Four Persons Injured on the Great Xo.'thern. Park RIVER. Dec. 15.— A serious ac cident occurred this morning nt 11:50 on the Langdon branch of the Great Northern. The mixed train from Lang don for Larimore ran onto a broken rail at a point four miles north of Park River. The speed of the train when the obstruction was met did not exceed twenty miles an hour. The rail did not give way until the engine had passed over it. The first car, a passenger coach, tore up the ties, and the rest of the train, made up of heavily loaded freight cars, forced the engine and coach ahead until the latter rolled oil the road bed over a small wooden bridge, fol lowed by three of the freight cars. The stove in the overturned coach set fire to the woodwork, and the injured pSssen gers confined therein were only saved from being burned to death by the prornut action of the engineer, Bennett, and Conductor Maxwell, who, with the rest of the train crew, extinguished the Bra and rescued the injured men. No one was killed outright, and it is be lieved that none of the injuries will prove fatal. William Flannigan, of Langdon, was badly bruised and cut by flying glass. He was sitting close to the stove when the car left the track, and was covered with a shower of hot ashes. B. Stevenson, of Gardner, who was sitting with Flannigan, is also badly burned. Christian Oleson, of Gardner, is severely cut and burned. Ills injuries are the most serious. News of the accident was at once telegraphed to Grand Forks from Park River and a wrecking train was dispatched from that place, carrying half a dozen sur geons. So far as can now be learned those alone named are the only ones in jured. Engineer Bennett was badly shaken up, but not seriously hurt. Con ductor Maxwell reports that the train was running at the usual rate of speed, and that the accident could not by any forsight on the part of the train crew have been prevented.
