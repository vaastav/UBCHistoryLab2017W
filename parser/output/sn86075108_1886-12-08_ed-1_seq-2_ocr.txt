The workingmen of Anaconda have gracefully submitted to the slight, but inevitable reduction of wages, and the great works are once more in active op eration. The workmen of Anaconda have.actcd wisely and well. The Civil Service Commissioners are said to have in contemplation a plan by which they hope to popularize the sy* tem. Can it be jtossible that thpy pro pose to suggest to Congress a repeal ol the law ? asks the Courier-Journal. The appointment of Wm. A. lines a reeeiver of the Bozeman land office, is a just recognition of the Young MenV Demccratic club of Gallatin county, o! which lie is president, as well as a re ward for his faithful services during the ■ recent campaiga. It is said that the President's message will encourage Mr. Hewitt's tariff reform bill. This measure was endorsed by Mr. Randall, Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Morrison, and was largely engrafted upon the bill presented by Mr. Randall, after the fail uro ot Mr. Morrison's more drastic pro position. . Frederick Dubois, who has been elected delegate to Congress from Idaho, only went to that Territory three years ago. President Arthur appointed him United States Marshal largely to resist the en croachments of Mormon treason, and he now («mes back to Washington a pro nounced auti Mormon delegate. A lot of postal cards scut to England have ix-en returned for the reason that they violate a provision of the Interna tional Postal Agreement in that the ad dresses were printed on little slips and Darted on the cards in the same manner that newspapers are addressed*. The Courrier des Ltait-Uais says that it is not the alliance of Germany and Austria which is a guarantee of peace, but the Franco Russian alliance which will preserve peace aue-ng the the Euro pean Powers. The arbitrators cf Europe are no longer located at Berlin. Tlie w reck last Wednesday at Glvn don, on the X. P., was of more serious consequence than was at first supposed. An old postal employee was burned-to death and all the mall destroyed by fire. The lrlanre of the disaster is laid upon a train-dispatcher, who has been arrested for manslaughter. The North ern Pacific railroad h*s been noticeably free from disasters of this kind, and it is to be sincerely regretted that the record bas at last been broken. • With this issue we begin the publica tion of our new 6toiy, which everyone will perceive by the opening chapters, is as we have stated, a storv of more than ordinäre merit. We believe that a good short story is an attractive feature to a paper which circulates as does the Chronicle, among the firesides of farm ers. Contrary to the general belie*, these continued stories are somewhat expensive, especially to the Chronicle, which is so fa; removed from eastern centres. Secretary Whitney was very generous with Thanksgiving turkeys. He made arrangements to give each officer and employe of the navy department a fowl of such weight as each pieferrcd, and three hundred of the clerke availed themselves of the courtesy. On a simi lar occasion last year, the Secretary dis pensed about the t-ame number of tur keys to navy department employes. Nor wae Mrs. Whitnev behind the Sec retary in the donation of good cheer. She sent word to the home of the Little Suters of the Poor and to the Colored Womens' home, that ehe would like to provide Thanksgiving dinners for those institutions. A list of articles wanted was sent, and the order was prômply honoied by Mis. Whitney, who made some suitable additions to the bill ol fare for the old ladies and old men of the home, of con the in the for "» 60 00 the Secretary Whitnev, in his report, shows that our navy is in a woeful con dition, and if no improvement is made in six years, we will have no navy at all. _ "Doe." Wilson, the young man who successfully compelled Deacon Moen, of Providence, R. I., to give him $150,000, and upon Moen's failure to further "put up," entered suit against him, is out with a confession, in which he says that he is a son of Moen's by a former wife. The confession has made quite a sensa tion in the religious circles of Provi dence, of which Moen is the hub. fudge Wade of Helena has issued the temporary restraining order against the water contracts recently made by the c >uncil of Helena with a Mr. Woolston. This does not settle the case, however as the council will at once move that the-injunction be dissolved. The case nas become of great interest to the whole territory, and the result of the fight will be anxiously looked for. Judge Wade painfully sentenced Kemp oberts, the defaulting treasurer of Lew is aftd Clarke county, to two years in the penitentiary on Friday last. This was the lightest sentence possible to place UDon the crime, and it is altogether like ly that Mr. Roberts will be pardoned as soon as a petition now being circulated is presented to the acting governor, Webb. Mr. Roberts' crime was that of negligence and incompetency, rather than of rascality. Ife has the sympathy of a large number of friends. of Henry Watterson says: "Now we ap proach a city." He means that the President's letter to Mr. Stone, refusing to reinstate him to office, has the true ring of honest democracy. He believes that Mr. Cleveland has now caught the real meaning of the Democratic idea o representative, republican government, based upon party responsibility. "True civil service reform means the execu tion of the will of the people, rendered at the last election, to restore a just party responsibility by turning out of office the republicans, who are responsible for nothing, and putting in Democrats, who are tesponsible for the administration." S. it In the report of Postmae 1er General Vilas, which was made public several days ago, it is shown that the United States leads all the world, in its mail facilities, and in the number of letters sent The letters mailed in this country during the year were more than we'e mailed in France, Germany and Austria combined. The number of post offices in this country now is 53,614. The re port also shows a great deal in the line of reform. Owing to the reduction of the rate of postage- on tecond-olass mat ter, and the enlargement of the unit of weight for first-eiass matter, the ex penses of the postal department were expected to exceed its revenue for the fiscal year of 1886 at least $9,000,000. A decrease of expenditures, however, has made the actual' deficit about $3.000,000 less than that, and the deficit for the current year will be still lets. Figures show that the net increase of revenue in this d-partment was 3.2 per cent, and that the vnhtme of business by which it was gained, increased over 7 per cent. That is another proof which commercial and other statistics establish, that there lias been a steady return of business prosperity during the past year and a halt. This is the wav in which the country goes to ruin under Democratic rule, which must be very depressing to the Republican prophets of evil. 1 

ROAD LAW. According to Judge Wade's late deci sion and showing of what legally consti tutes a read, published elsewhere, is of great importance to the people of this county, who have year after year been clamoring for what they regard as their rights and entailing a vexatious amount of labor upon the county com missioners in the settlement of these questions. To us it seems imperatively necessary the forthcoming legislature should enact suitable road laws, that will protect many we now have in operation and provide for the legal opening of many more vet to be opened and placed at tl»e disposal of the many agriculturists yet to settle, in this and other valleys. SUBSCRIBE NOW. There are many citizens of Bozeman and Gallatin county, who are not sub scribers of the Chronicle, although they read it whenever an opportunity pre sents itself. We have the facilities for printing a much larger edition than is now published, and we are particularly desirous of placing the Chronicle in the family of every citizen. We try to make it a chan, newsy paper, a faithful re flector of every passing event of local and general import. The subscription price is within the reach of all, and the amount of good reading presented week ly is certainly as suitable in quantity and quality a» that furnished by other papers at the same price. During the vear 1887 we promise to make the Onwi'Nici.i even better than it has been in the pa«t, and propose to add many new- and attractive features to its make up and matter. Take it on trial for three months, and if it is not up tu your expectations, we will promptly *top it. 1 ROAD Litt NEEDED. We understand that there is more than the usual number ot petitions for new roads on file in the county clerk's office, awaiting the action of the county boaid. In view of the fact that the leg islature will provide other and probably more suitable road laws, we Ij-elieve that the commissioners would be justi fied in tabling the petitions until their next meeting in March. Even if noth ing is done bv the legislature, no harm will be sustained by a postponement ol the county commissioners until March, when road work is generally begun. Tlie matter of roads is one of vexatious import to our coiyunssioners and the l>eopl6 as well. Even session of tlie commissioners finds a large number of petitions on hand, and the principal part of the commissioners' labor is de voted to the adjustment of grievance* in this particular. Home of our legislators should immortalise himself by becoming familiar with the defects of the present road laws, and, bv the introduction of a hill, fill a long-felt want and cause the people to rise np and call him blessed. TWO 

PICTURED. A Dakota correspondent presents a dark picture indeed of the poor Dakota farmer, who, living upon the boundless "blizzardv" plains of that flat, op country, tills an almost barre» soil—un less he dwells upon the alluvial deposits of tlie Red River,—subsisting and: suffer in . during the long months of a rigorous winter of almost Arctic sever ity, without fuel at hand, except that shipped in, and for sale along the lints con at who of "put out that wife. the the the that case the the Lew the was place like as of ap the true the o f for of railroads. That which be with diffl* culty produces, brings him a very mea ger compensation. For instance, eggs five cents per dosen, butter three cents per pound; he raises from live to fifteen bushels of wheat to the acre, and ob tains for it at the railroad, 40 to 48 cents per bushel, and so it is down the whole list of farm productions. On the other hand, he pays as much for his groceries and necessary clothing as we in Mon tana; his fuel costs him $8 to $13 per ton, and, adding to all of this he lives in a land unbounded with anything in nature to gratify or please the eye. In summer re line of of ex the A has the in and it a the to of this as of he is surrounded by myriads of mosqui toes, and in winter bv the dpwlatedrear iness of excessive cold, and the dire and dreadful blizzard, which, with the force of a tornado, fihs the air with blinding snow, making it impossible to venture ^orth, oft-times for days. This is not an unreal picture of the prairie composing not all, but a vast portion of Dakota. Let us look at the other picture by plac ing them side by side, and conscientious ly draw your conclusions as to which presents the brighter view: In mountainous Montana fuel can be had for the cutting, while vast coal fields exist in every portion of its domain. Wood is sold to those who buy it for $4 to 5 per coni, coal from $4.50 to $6 per ton. Groceries and clothing are no higher here than in Dakota, while our farmer at this time of year gets 35 to 45 cents per dozen for eggs, almost the same per pound for butter; for oats he receives from $1.35 to $1.50 per cwt. and other cereals in proportion. The soil, composed of the rich washing of the mineral mountains, is very rich and everlastingly so, yielding him, year after year, under natural conditions, from 30 to 60 bushels of cereals per acre. His cattle range without expense on the mountain sides, in close Droximity; his lew lands are covered with a luxuriant growth of tlie most nutritious grasses known, which, when converted into hay, bring from $10 to $20 per ton. Protected by the high mountain ranges and visited by the warm, balmy "chinook" winds of the Pacific, his winter life enables him to procure his winter fuel aud fencing. Such is the picture that Montana farm ers—at least those of the Gallatin valley — can hold up to the view of their Da kota brethren and truthfully say: "Mine is an enviable lot." Let the farmers of this section, in view of these facts, wiiich bv no means fully or exhaustive ly do justice to the subject, make up their minds to provide for themselves a comfortable home and a valuable herit age for their posterity. for is re The Railroad Collision. The Pioneer Press gives the following particulars of the recent wreck on the N. P. Railroad: The through Pacific coast passenger train (No. 1) which left St. Paul yester day afternoon and the Fargo accommoda tion (No. 6) which left Fargo this morn ing on tlie Northern Pacific, came in col lision just west of Muskoda at 8 o'clock this morning The engineer of No. 1 saw the other train approaching and slowed up, but No. 6 was around a curve and struck at full speed. The engineer and fireman jumped and escaped with out serious harm except Fireman John Doyle, of No. 6, who was cut about the forehead and face. The shock disabled the engines and forced the tenders through the mail and baggage cars. The stoves in the mail car was overturned. setting the car on fire. Attention was at on«e given to saving the rest of tlie train and the mail car, with ail the mail, ex cept a few papers, was hauled away and left to burn When tlie shock came, E. R. Lennen one of the mail agents, was asleep in the car, and on awaking found himself in the wreck. By hard work he managed to crawl out of the broken top, and fainted on the snow. He was soon found and removed to a car, when it was discovered that his shoulder was dislocat ed his head cut aud body bruised, and internal injuries are feared. He was delirious all the morning. It was them discovered that Mail Agent C. M. Tennis of Rrainerd was missing, and Linnen stated that he was standing where the shock would throw him on the hot stove As soon as the flames would allow, search was made for the body, and HIS HEART AND A FEW BONES were found late in the afternoon. About noon a work train from Detroit arrived, and at once commenced to lay a track around the wreck, which was finished, and trains moved at 6:30 p. m. The tem perature was 20 below zero and blowing a gale and the large number of passengers wete obliged to remain in the cars all day or the waiting room of the depot. The loss of mail is complete, All tne mail from points between Fargo and Portland, including registered mail, was totally destroyed. No. 6 did not carry mail except in pouches, and this was saved. B ,th engines are badly smashed and besides the car and tender burned, several are badly broken and. the baggage car was on fire aid only pui out with difficulty. Conductor Eldred was sitting in the baggage car and the the tender went through it, crushing the chair he was sitting on, and hrusing him about the head and chest. His escape was marvelous. It was deemed best by Dr. Loyell not to inform Lennen of the death ofTennis. Nothing prevented the des truction of both trains but the engineer of No. 1, seeing the smoke of the other train, slowed up. The responsibility rests with the train dispatcher, who gave contrary orders. His name is Cole, and he is a dispatcher of over twenty years' exi>erience, and has been an employe of the Northern Pacific for many years. Why he should make such an error is a mystery to his fellow employes. The Office-Seeki ng Wants. At this season of the year we see manv evidences of a blind and infatuated de sire for office. Those who could ndt get to the state legislature, now rush to the state capitol, to solicit, with a zeal worth v of a better cause; every kind of menial office, as lackeys, and waiters, tending doors, making fires, sweeping ball and cleau'ng spittons; no matter what if but an office! What an hullucina ion, for a man of proper dignity of feeling, to leave his home, family and business, if be has any for such a motive. I trust all of my good friends who have good homes and loving ones will not desert them dunng lonely davs of winter for such trifling game. Sooner tend vonr flocks and herds and cut your wood, and then the short days of winter closes, and the long evenings come instead of hieing away to some tavern or «sore near by, to spend the hours in silly gossips, or per haps worse, pile on the wood until a cheerful fire blasas upon yonrown hearth stone or in year stove, and after danc ing the little beys and girls, if von bave any, upon yonr knee, and telling them amusing storks (not about ghosts or bears) until they are sleepy and put to bed, then address yourself to the older one«, or to your newspapers or books, as thè , , „ ____ _ , _ , ^ ~™pleted to Fort Benton by Christ mM THINGS TERRITORIAL. The census of Helena is now finished. When completed it will show the popula tion to be between 10,000 and 11,000. The Territorial Teachers' Association will meet at Butte, Dec. 28, 29, and 30. Railroads will give reduced rates to teachers. Many teams and men are now employ ed in the construction of the Montana Central. They expect to have the grad Sam Hauser, governor of Montana, has written the champion Thanksgiving proclamation of the year. He announces the dav as appointed by the president and recommends its observance without any useless verbage whatever.—Big Horn Sentinel!;; IIon.T. J. Lowery was buried in Hel ena Monday at 2 p. m. His funeral cortege was one of the longest known in the history of Helena. Rev. E. T. Webb, of the Episcopal church read the funeral services, and his burial was conducted by the Masonic order. The Montana bar passed many resolutions in honor of the one lost from their number, in the distirct court. It is rumored that the Consolidated Ten Mile Mining Reduction Company will shortly start operations on a large scale. The mines of the company are located at Red Mountain and belong to J. J. Hill, C. A, Broadwater and the Montana Central Railway Company. The company own thirty-four well de veloped mines on the mountain and work will probably open on eight or ten of them. Tne mines, formerly owned by J. J. Russeli, are now the property of this company and their purchase led to the building cf the Montana Ontra» to Red Mountain. Should the rumor prove true, employment will be given to 300 or 400 men. Postoffices in Montana have been dis continued as follows: Profile, Fergus county. Mail to halbert, Rapids, Yellow stone county. Mail to Stillwater. Hunt ley. Yellowstone caunty. Mail to Bil lings. Service has been discontinued be tween Billing and Huntlev. Manager Maguire, who is in San Fran cisco, says that he has secured the John L. Sullivan combination for a tour of the Montana circuit. The telegram did net say when ihev would come, but it will probably be within a month at least Local sporting men will probably try to make arrangements to have Jim P.ates stand before Jack Burke, who is with Sullivan, for a stated number of rounds. The following is among the appoint ments of postmasters Thursday: George W. Carlton, of Deer Lodge, Mont., vice E. 8. Stackpole, suspended. M. J. Haley, timber inspector for the government, is in Helena. The Utah & Northern folks are busy making estimates of material on hand and needed to complete the boardening oftoat road form Pocatello to Butte, General manager Callaway and presi dent Harris of the Northern Pacific ar ranged so that Butte has a morning train to Helena, it will leave Butte at 8.04 a. m. and returns about the Fame time the Helena train if ies. This ar rangement gives passengers going East or West via Union Pecific direct cannec tions through. A comparative monthly statement showing business transacted at Helena, Butte and Anaconda between the Unluu aud Northern Pacific lines for the month of October, 1885, has been complied at the Helena general office and shows an increase of about 800,000 pounds of freight on the Northern Pacific over the month of September, for Helena station. B itte shows a similar increase in favtr of the Union Pacific, while Anaconda is about even. The Union Pacific has just issued the following general order : All conductors and engineers will before going on duty, have their watches carefully examined by a competent and licenced watchmaker who will, if the watch is reliable, issue a numbered certificate. A variation of over30 seconds per week will be consider ed a sign of unreliability. The Journal of the Sixth Annual Convocation of the Missionary District of Montana, shows that the Episcopal church in this territory has 926 com municants, of whom 61 were confirmed the past year, value of church property $79,220; offerings during the year, paroch ial $16,415 92, diocesan $600,55, general $9.58,90. total $20,975.36, The Suuday school scholars number 689 and teachers 78. During the year there were 76 mar riages, 119 burials, 22 adult baptisms. There are twelve clergymen connected with the church. One cannot help but notice the favor able change in public feeling manifested ■ince tho works [Andaconda] were open ed. There is not that expression of anx iety and apprehension in {he faces of men out of employment. Thev are re lieved from the oppressive feeling in view of possible privation and suffering. The winter is robbed of its gloomy aspects. Wives and little ones are more hopeful. The dark cloud now has its silver lining, And business men are relieved; they are beginning to reach out after more trade; they are more willing to grant the usual credit until pay day comes; they are ad ding to the!» stock of goods and provi sions; they can see some hope of a favora ble settlemont with their many creditors. In every way the situation is improved and continues to improve.—Anaconda Review. A Mining Decision. An important mining decision has lately been rendered by Justice Field of the United States supreme court in which he defines what shall constitute the end lines of a lode mining claim. The Justice says; "If the first locator will not or can not make the explorations nece»*ary to ascertain the true course of the vein, and draws his end lines ignorantly, h - must bear the consequences. He can onlv. assert a lateral right to sc much of his vein as lies between vertical plains drawn through those lines. Junior loca tors will not be prejudiced thereby through subsequent explorations may show that he haa erred in his location. "The provision of the statute that the locator is entitled throughout their en tire depth to all the veins, lodes and ledge«, the top or apex of which lie in side the surfaire lines of his location, tends strongh to show that the end !in«s marked on tne ground must control. It often haDpens that the top or anex of mare than one vein lies within such sur face lines, and the veina -may have dif ferent cours a and dips, yet bis right to follow them outside ofthe side lines of thfe.locatioas must be bounded by the pimps drawn vertically through the amme ami line s. The planes of the end lines cannot b-s drawn at a right angle to the comee-of nJl the veina if they are not identical A strong eolation of atom water ap plied several times a day will remove Ttirts from intimais. 1 a ed of Bark Picture. Below we present a picture taken from life iff Dakota- To him surrounded by his herds in Gallatin valley, and those who are obtaining remunerative prices for all they raise in this garden spot, where fuel cau be had for the cutting, read this and be content: "No market, no fuel, no water, no fruit, no demand for labor," These are enumerated by Kimball, Dak., correspondent of "Farm and Fireside" as disadvantages of that part of the territory, which land agents and railroad speculators have lauded to the detriment of many restless people who were induced to leave compara tively comfortable homes at the East: "A four years' residence here has en abled me to speak advisedly, aud when I said that not one who came here and depended on farming for an income but has gone down hill I speak the simple truth. Those who came fullhanded and loaned their money, or invested it in stock, or went back to some reservation or isolated place and escaped taxation have made money. Crops are short and prices low. Wheat, live to fiften bush els per acre, 40 to 48 cents; oats, fifteen to thirty-five bushels, 15 to 18.cents;corn of previous years fair, but most of it frostbitten; flax, four to ten bushels per acre, 80 to 90cents per bushel; milk no sale; butter, 3 cents per pound; eggs, cents per dozen; Jive-stock, 1 1-2 to 1-2 cents per pound. Now look on the other side: Soft coal, $8 per. ton; hard $13; dried fruits,9 to 20 cents per pound, owing to quality and kinds. The high price of fuel has driven even well to do œople to the' use of hay, corn stalks, flax-straw, and through the sum mer season almost all residing in the rural districts have used <n>w chips, which is a polite name lor dry cow dung, for fuel. Add to this a third ot a man's time for hauling water and your readers will have something ot a correst idea of the inconveniences and that that with rare exceptions, it is impossible for laboring men to get employment." Important if It Holds Water. A Laramie, Wyoming, special to the Salt Lake Tribune says : One ofthe most Important decisions ever rendered in this territory was delivered here to-day by Hon. Jacob B. Blair sitting as United States judge. The case was that of the United States vs. J. B. Çimpson, indicted at this term of court for peijury on two counts. Simpson had taken up a home stead entry in the state of Wisconsin, afterward ommuted it to the cash entry moved to this territory and entered a homestead here, swearing in proving up that he had never made a homestead en try prior to the one made in this terri tory. The point involved was whether or not the homestead entry made in Wisconsin, afterwards commuted, ex hausted his rights undér the homestead law. Judge Biair instructed the jury that Simpson's entry in Wisconsin did not exhaust his rights under the home stead law, and re-entering in this terri tory 1^ did not commit perjury. This is the first time the question was ever raised in tlie courts of this territory, and as far as known, the first time ever rais ed. The caBe attracted much attention. Judge Blair's opinion is long and ex haustive. The rights of settlers under various land laws are fully discussed. The derision meets with general approv al, the members of the liar especially ex pressing satisfaction. Hire us statehood The question of statehood in Montana opens up a large field for speculation and involves a collateral issue known to con gress as tlie admission of Washington territory. Now, the facts are that Wash iugton territory is republican Charley Voorhees was elected nntplr on the anti Northern Pacific platform. There is nothing in the vote of the agricultur al territory to show that it is democratic whereas there is everything to show that the territory of Montana is democratic in every essential particular. It has car ried the lower house ami a majority on joint ballot and made a square stand ofi on the county offices, notwithstanding the fact that a number of county capi tal and county division contests entered into the fight for supremacy, which will be recorded is a great issue between the parties. The fact ft; the whole struggle has been based on the statehood issue, and there is every reason why dominant de mocracy should carrv its point, and any man in the territory of Montana who takes a diffrert view of the situation is no friend to this grand territory. Upon this great issue of statehood the Inde pendent stands with all of the power it can command among its constituency.— Independent. Effort to Compromise Difference*. A strongeffort will be made during this session to effect a compromise ofthe dif ference between the Senate and House on the Northern Pacific land grant forfeiture bills. The delay and doubt of pending legislation has effected the sale of Idnds by the road, and its officers are anxious to dispose of all controversy which effects titles. The Senate bill forfeits certain lands in Oregon and Washington territory, while the House bill covers all west of Bismarck, to which point the road was finished within the time specified by the erant. The North ern Pacific people will not say what they are willing to agree upon, but they have said they would not contest the Senate bill in the event ofrits becoming a law. A recent decision of the supreme court has established beyond all controversy that land forfeitures on the basis of de lay in completion of a road will not be withheld, and for this reason the House may now be more favorably disposed than heretofore. A Railroad Collision. In lefinent inform ltion was re »ived in Bozeman regarding a wreck on the rail road last Thursday. The Independent soon alia.« ed the w >r»t tears of those who were expecting friends by the following: There was a collision this morning (Wednesday) at 8 o'clock on the North ern Pacific, between the mail train No. and the ejurt bound passenger No. 6, on curve two miles west of Muska i i, Both locomotives were smashed and the mail car of No. 1 was burned. C «doctor Eldred and the enaineer and fireman of No, 6 Were all slightly braised about the head, and Mail Agent Linner was similarly hurt, besides a dislocation of the shoulder. All were surgically treat here and have gone to the hospital at Brainerd and are verv comfortable. Part the mail was destroyed. The mail trim was five hours late and the two trains bad conflicting orders. Denan ob Honduras .... Colonel ' Pat''Donan has looked over Honduras and, concludes that it is the last place that ana 'Ammo »n should seek' for an investment.

There are telegraph lines through the country, but tney belong to the Gov ernment, and were established for mili tary purposes. The topography is too rough for railroad purooses, and I do not think that foreign investors, however much they may be encouraged by Presi dent Bogian, will be liable to place their money in the country. There are Americans there now, but I cannot say how well they are doing." Townslte and Mineral Patent*. Secretary Lamar has written a letter to Commissioner Sparks of the general land office, that will reverse the practice of that bureau in issuing patents for mining claims. It has been the practice of the department in granting patent« covering lodes or mining claims that in terfere with townslte claims, to give sur face i mprovements and betterments to the tovvnsite claimants. In the case of. Du'• fen bach vs. Hawke, the supreme court derided that the fee simple to the ground was indivisible and included the surface as well as the subterranean pos sessions'. On October 25th, Commissioner Sparks addressed a leUer to Secretary Lamar, stating the practice of the de partment, citing the decisions of the court , and asking for instructions. The stcretarv replied that the decision of the court must be followed and conveyances made to lode claims including the sur face improvements. Newspaper and Advertiser.
