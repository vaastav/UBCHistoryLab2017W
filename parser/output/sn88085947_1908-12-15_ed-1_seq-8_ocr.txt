PRESIDENT'S PICTURE LESSON TO CONGRESS SENDB THEM PHOTOGRAPHS FROM CHINA SHOWING THE EVIL EFFECTS OF DEFOREST ATION. Sp*clal Correspondence to The Freer WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.—1n his valedictory message to congress President Roosevelt declared that If there was any one duty which, more than another, we owe it to our children and our children's chil dren to perform at once, it is to save the forests of the country. That this subject is very close to the president's heart is shown by the fact that he appended to his message and thereby put into the hands of every senator and repre sentative photographs showingfl as the president said, in vivid fashion, the appalling desolation taking the shape of treeless mountains and barren plains which immediately followed deforestation of the moun tains in China. Reproduced herewith are two striking photographs which the president presented to congress. They show the great lesson that is just being learned in America, that with the destruction of the trees comes the destruction of the soil, changing climate and general deso lation. The president said: "What has thus happened in nortern China, what has happened in central Asia, in Palestine, in north Africa, tn parts of the Mediterranean coun tries of Europe, will surely happen in this country if we do not exer cise that wise forethought which should be one of the chief mark* of any people calling itself civil ized." Most men are sorry not because they have sinned, but because of the result of their sin. Holiday gifts in pipes. 75c to $10.00; calabash, meerschaums, briars, endless variety, at M. A.

INTIMATE • CORREaPOTiDEHCE Dear Dad: What did I tell you? The Indianapolis News is in the Ananias club. As you may suspect, I am shedding no tears. I don't mind ordinary newspaper abuse; but it always seemed to me that the News was a little bit out of the ordinary in the cheapness of its spleen. Of course, it is Mr. Fair banks' knuckles that are smarting. While the president's letter talks about Delavan Smith, everybody knows that the paper gets its ani mus from Fairbanks. Having lost the presidential nomination, and been sidetracked for the vice presi dency. Fairbanks has continued his abuse of Taft and Roosevelt from motives which impel the political blackmail artist. The price of quit ting'was a fine foreign appointment in the diplomatic service. Just be tween us, he has a poorer chance for anything like this than Hooker T. Washington has to be selected an honorary president of the Colon ial Dames. "Curse him, but he can be agree able when he has a mind to." This was a remark I heard from a New York gentleman emerging from a conference with T. R. I was sitting in the anteroom, and the words were not intended for my ears. You see, T. R. was doing a little "ar ranging" in regard to Mr. Root go ing to the senate, and the New York party was getting an experi ence of T. R.s winning ways and manners. I got a look at the guns T. R. is going to take with him to Africa. A pair of Winchester rifles 45 61-9 caliber are all he will carry. He be lieves this will do for ail occasions. If it comes to getting through the hide of an elephant or rhinocerous he will use a steel capped explosive bullet. Sodium nitrate Is the chemical ■with which the millers bleach ordi nary flour. At a hearing recently the question came up whether this chemical was injurious to the per son eating bread, cake, pastry, etc., and an expert took tbe stand and deposed as follows: Ordinary bread contains twenty-five thousandths part per million, and a loaf of bread weighing 453 grains, or one pounu, would require, in order to get one gram of nitrous anhydride into the human system, the consumption of 10,000 loaves of bread, which would be equal to about 36 barrels of flour. The average individual con sumes about one-half a loaf of bread a day, or all told, 182 loaves of bread a year. Figuring that he would commence to eat his half loaf of bread the day he was born (not a likely supposition), and that ho retained uucbauged all the nitrate (also uulikelyj, be would be
