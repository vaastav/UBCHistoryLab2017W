That may be shown later. The Journal wants to again empha size the necessity for vaccination as u preventive. While sufficient data has not been tubulated for accurate Judgment, suf fice it to say that only u very small percentage of those vaccinated take flu, and those who do take it have it in light form, as a rule. But the most Important vaccination, beyond doubt, is that against pneu monia. Pneumonia, year In and year out, is the most fatal disease known to the American people. Dr. Evans of Chi ; cago, than whom there is probably no better authority, says that not more than one person In two hundred dies from the flu, when pneumonia does not set in. , - But more than twenty-five persons in rv'i-y hundred die. when pneumonia develops. More than two years ago nn English physician, connected with the British army 1n Africa, developed a pneu monia vaccine which is now being generally used by the United States army. One or more physicians in Albu querque now have that vaccinne. Tt bus been demonstrated, Dr. Evans says, that this vaccina is effective against pneumonia for eight months. There is no danger from its use and the cost is nothing compared with the insurance it gives. The eight months one is rendered, practically immune from pneumonia covers the months of greatest danger Just ahead of us, December, January, February and March. Because of the flu, when it is pre ventable by vaccination, probably, and because the death rate from it Is ren dered nearly nothing by vaccination against -pneumonia, this city should not be again subjected to fiuarantine, which, unless we make the quaran tine so rigid that people be no't al lowed to leave the trains here, may be continued for two or thres years. The Journal is not advocating com pulsory vaccination, but lr. Iocs be lieve that when the advantages cf vaccination against pneumonia have been generally understood there should be no, quarantine for the pro tection of these people wlio are so careless or so skeptical as to refuse to employ if. 1. ft: -i - ... the i:ii.uot) pkobi.im. .. .. In . his message to congress, the president made it very clear that he Is not an advocato, at this time, of government ownership ,(f railroads. (That his party may become such advocate, is hardly likvly. The south . is cservative and the railroads still "have great influence there In the nomination of candidates at the pri maries. Also the example of government operation of railroads through which the country is now going has not en-, tlearcd it to the people That it was necessary for unification of control, we have no doubt. The Interstate commerce laws hampered the com i panics to .such a degree tlar. capital could not be secured for betterments. Also the law prohibited pooling of tracks -and rolling stock where it could be shown that such pooling was destructive of competition. Even when acting under Instructions from the war council, roads were warned by the. United States attorney veneral that they must not violate the law. Then .the president ordered them taken over n a war measure. The administration of Director Gen eral McAdoo was probably a.", able as cauld have been given by any man in America. But it Was not popuI.tr. ..because It cost so much more to the traveling and shipping public than formerly and the service was not so , efficient. ; Also let it be undorstood-ttiat the . forty per cent increase in coft to the public was not a producer of reverues for carrying on the war. The cost whs enormously increased in order that the government might be saved from serious loss in operating ex penses. Whatever the government does-is so entagled with red tape that It is bound to cosj far more than It should cost. It Is notorious that when a federa.1 building is to be erected no intelligent contractor will bid less than about double the amount he would expect to bid on n building to be orected by a business ma or a corpo vat Ion. Then he nearly always loses money. But the president is right i'l st.Uing that railroads, if returned to opera tion by the owners, must be freed from the ruinous laws enacted by a congress composed of men bent upon currying favor with people who had been taught that the railroads were robbing the public, and must be pun ished. The people who insisted upon such regulation were not aware that they were doing themselves more harm than they were doing the roads. It took the war to reveal to the public real condition's of the common car riers. The greatest danger to tbis country js the demagogue. Usually he is a man with a glib tongue and an itch for office. In neralv all cases he has Vnade a failure of business or profes sional life, and he goes about telling other people now they could be rich and happy but for the "robber cor porations." Never paying taxes him self, he always know.i precisely how taxes should be levied and by whom paid. Unfortunately there are always peo ple who listen to theso glib whiffets of a shallow school that is bent on reforming something. Generally the greatest need is that the reformers reform themselves. It seems that Marshal Foch has in formed Berlin that the terms of the armistice nust be complied with or Germany will be occupied "by the arm ies of the allies. 'Icrmany sought to have the war ended dii her own terms, and when the rrmist'.co was signed the new German government fo'sns to regard the cat-lying out f-t the terms as on outrage. NOT IllXE BY 

TKIO PEOPLE. . Richard Mueller, chief of the Ger man Soldiers' and Workmen's coun cil, says: . - "We don't want a democratic re public. We want a socialistic, nay, a proletarian, republic. Enough has been said." . These men mean, as Haywood of the I. W. W meant, that government shall be of one class, and that the most ignorant class of the whole world men who havs saved nothing for themselves, who recognize no binding family ties, who recognize no rulership of God, who desire that they shall take over and use for themselves the things other people have earned. President Wilson declared the pur pose of the United States in entering the war was to "make the world safe for democracy." But the Bolshevists of Russia, Germany and the United States want no' democracy; they want rule by a class, by those who not only have no property but who want all property owned in common. These modern proletarians repre sent no considerable portion of the working class of any country. They may better be described ns riff-raff, Mostly they ,have been frequenters of saloons and dives, and have resented the fact that now and then they had to work for bread and lodging. They do not build homes; they do not want the responsibility of sup porting families; they would not have wifo and children to hamper them; the harlot, satisfies their lust and they would have the state rear all children. Who would pay the taxes they never state in their literature. What the modern proletarian wants is a world in which one person is not more respectable than another, where morality would bo regarded as brand ing man or woman as an enemy worthy of death. '. ; In' Russia a wholesale., slaughter of all the people who had acquired prop- crty was planned, and some thousands of them were actually butchered, though the signing of the armistice prevented the enactment of an 'en larged St. Bartholomew's. 1 ; President Wilson, speaking for the American peop'e, demands that the world be made safe for democracy. Democracy means rule of the people, for the people and by the people; not rule of a certain class of the people. Henry Ford announces that lie is going to start a newspaper through which he hopes to get before the country the things he hoped to do lit the senate. It will be far cheaper for Mr. Ford if lie will confine his Jour nalistic experiences to the advertising columns. ' " ' When we are casting up the ac count against the German people, we should take into : consideration thnt there must have bf en 'many thousands of German soldiers Who never shot a ntirse or crucified a Belgian woman or ravished a girl in the occupied ter ritories, f i The crown prince blames the gen eral staff for failure of the war. The kaiser blames von Bethmann-Hollweg and von Jagow. This seems to be the time in Germany for passing the buck, If Mooney was not guilty of w pre paredness day bomb outrages, who was? He may be Innocent, but if ho, was there is little doubt that he knows who was guilty. . - '-..."
