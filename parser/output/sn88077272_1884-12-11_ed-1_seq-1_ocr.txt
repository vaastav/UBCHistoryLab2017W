POWDER IN A KITCHEN Accidentally Exploded, Tears the House to Pieces. House to Pieces. Eight Persons Receive Fearful Blast--- House to Pieces. Eight Persons Receive Fearful Blast---One Expected to Recover. Doveb, N. H., December 5. Stephen Young, a well-to-do farmer of Strafford Corner, "eighteen miles from here, had oc casion to drill through rock for a well in the rear of his house. He employed Geo. L. Goodwin to do the work, assisted by Z. Taylor Berry. A basket of Atlas powder cartridges was used in boring the well, one of which Goodwin attached to a battery, which did not work. He placed the battery and cartridges in the kitchen, on a basket containing other cartridges. About five o'clock. George Young, of Lowell, Mass., a visitor, in company with Miss Sadie Greenfield, took the battery in his hand. Instantly a loud explosion followed. The house was demolished, the first floor being blown into the cellar, and the back part of the house blown out. At the time, eightpersons were in the house, and all wereterribly injured. George L. Goodwin, died this morning. Thelfollowing four will die: George Young, jr. , Joseph May, Mary Anne Young, and Z. T. Berry. Those in- i'ured, but not fatally, are Sadie Greenfield, 511a Ready, and Stephen Young. At Ip. m. Z. T. Berry, Joseph May's and George Young's death was hourly ex pected. Mary Anne Young may linger some days. The house took fire, and with its contents, was burned to the ground. Everybody was afraid to go near the house during the fire, fearing a further explo sion of cartridges. The explosion was heard a distance of fifteen miles. Money and notes of considerable value were lost. Of the seven survivors, it is doubtful if any will recover, except Miss Sadie Greenfield. To-night the death of George Young, Mary Young, Zachary F. Berry and Joseph May is expected at any moment. Ella Ready, heretofore thought only slightly injured, is growing rapidly worse from internal burns. Stephen Young, aged eighty-three years, became prostrate this afternoon from his wounds, and it is thought his injuries may prove fatal, ow ing to his extreme age. Miss Greenfield is out of danger. She is a sister of High Sheriff Greenfield, and was soon to be married to Geo. Young. Stephen Young is the wealthiest farmer in town. The faces of the victims are black from the dynamite. Two surgeons are in constant attendance. The moans of the sufferers are dreadful. The scene of the explosion is visited by crowds, but nothing marks the spot except a pile of bricks from four large chimneys. The Cotton Crop.

An excit ing event occurred on the Kingston and Pembroke Railroad out-bound trained last evening. It seems that one of the passen gers had a valise which contained some kind of chemicals that heat affected, and while the train was running at a good speed an explosion oc cur ed. About thirty people were in the car. and a great commotion followed. The fire communicated to the seats, and but for the efforts or the trainmen and passengers who applied snow in the absence of water the coach would have been destroved. The contents of the valise are unknown. Smuggled Chinamen Drowned. Victoria, B. O, December 5. A few days since it was reported that a three-ton sloop, which left here with nineteen China men, who were to be smuggled, and two white men. for the American shore, had been swamped and all hands lost. In addition to this disaster, two more white men, who left Voul Bay seven weeks ago in a leaky boat with twelve Chinamen, for Washington Territory, have not since been heard of, and all are believed drowned. The temptation to smuggle Chinamen across the border is very strong, as for each one landed the owners of the boat receive twenty-five dollars. To Answer for Murder. London, December 4.

Lord Chief Justice Coleridge, in pronouncing the de cision of the Court, said all the Judges agreed that the act of the prisoners amounted to murder, and conviction must be affirmed. The Judges throughout the hearing showed great horror for the act of which the prisoners were guilty, and were unwilling to set a precedent which should allow such a crime to be considered other than murder.

PRESIDENT-ELECT. After Laying Down the Duties of Governor He Shall Listen to His Friends—Things May Not Move Fast as Some Wish. New York, December 4. A Washington special to the Evening Post says: "A prominent Democratic member of Congress who has recently visited Governor Cleve land, says the latter said to him: 'I in tend to resign on the 6th of January, and as Lieutenant Governor Hill will adminis ter the Executive office for the next year, I have turned the writing of the message over to him. After laying down the duties of Governor, I shall listen to what ever my Democratic friends have to say. I shall divide my time between Albany and Buffalo until the day arrives to go to Washington. I intend to give due consid eration to the counsel of our party friends. It may be that when I enter the Presiden tial office some things may not move as fast as some Democrats wish. But 1 think it would be better to go slow, and be sure. We cannot hope to avoid mistakes, but if we proceed slowlv we will make fewer mistakes than if we go with a rush.? The member of Con gress with whom Mr. Cleveland talked says the Governor will become President without anv ambition for a second term : that he holds to the second-term principle laid down in his letter of acceptance, and declared that his great object is to admin ister the Government as to lay the founda tion of a lone-continued Democratic rule. Governor Cleveland spoke to his visitor of the efforts of certain hotels in Washington to use him tor advertising purposes, by offering him their hospitalities free of charge, and emphatically declared he would not stop at any hotel that sought to get him as a guest. The Governor incidentally alluded to the report of a quarrel between himself and Hen dricks, savinc that thev did not in their conversation discuss politics, and that two men never parted more pleasantly . 1 hi s Congressman drew from his conversation with Mr. Cleveland that the latter has not yet made up his mind with regard to a single Cabinet appointment. He is defer ing these matters until he retires from the Governorship." France and China. Paris, December 4.

The Pall Mall Gazette discredits the dispatch vesterdav from Hong Kong to the Times, which stated that China was determined to resist France a l'outrance, and would insist on her suzerainty over Anam. The Standard's Hong Kong dispatch says the Chinese appear to have aban doned 'all hopes of mediation, and are determined upon a vigorous policy. Twelve men-of-war are ordered to engage the French fleet, and break the Formosa blockade. There are twenty -four Germans on the fleet. One commands a ship under the Chinese Admiral. Satisfaction is ex pressed, as a short and sharp campaign will make one of the combatants readier to entertain propositions of peace. The present situation is ruining trade. Heir to a Million.

LUCRETIA BORGIAS. Clearing up Mystery of the Dosed Milk at Fort Spring, Va. Two Servants Arrested for the Attempted Poisoning of Fourteen Persons. Wrrrnt Sulphur Springs, Va., Decem ber 7. Excitement continues intense in this county over the poisoning at Fort Spring, and County Attorney Dennis is at the scene, working up testimony. Doctor Beard, of Anderson, and Crowley, of Lew- isburg, are in attendance upon the sick, of which several are yet in a precarious con dition. Three attempts were made, and arsenic and strychina used each time. The families of Mathew Mann and Jas. W. Goodwin, his son-in-law, reside within fifty yards of each other and take their meals together in all fourteen persons. On November 24 the first attempt was made, the milk having been poisoned, but the acrid taste of the strychnine pre vented the families from drinking it. Mr. Godwin discovered it, and was made dan gerously sick, but the milk was thrown away without examination. On the 27th a second attempt was made. The family partook of biscuit, and Mann and his wife narrowly escaped death. Still no steps at detection were taken. The last attempt was on Monday night last .o t which time the milk was poisoned, and was partaken of by all but two persons. The result was that twelve members were in violent convul sions. Dr. Beard was summoned by tele graph, and upon examination of the milk found particles of strychnine glittering on its surface. He offered it to three dogs; two refused it, and the third lapped six swallows and died in ten minutes. Another physician was summoned, and everything possible was done for the sufferers. The adults have been removed from danger, but four little children are now wavering between life and death. The use of arsenio and strychnia together prevented sure death. Had either been used singly death must have inevitably followed. What lent mystery to the affair was that persons about the house, including servants, had been poisoned. A detective from Charles ton came to the spring and worked up the case. After two days Esther Ellis and Mary Johnson, colored women who lived near by, were arrested and committed to jail. They had been discharged from the employ of the families, and were supposed to have been actuated by revenge. They procured the poisons separately at Lewisburg, and are supposed to have placed it in the milk and flour at nigut. In their desire for re venge they used too much poison, and thus were saved the lives of nine ont of thirteen persons. The four little children have suf fered excruciatingly, and may have died before this time. Imports of Merchandise. Washington, Chief of the Bureau of Statistics, has submit ted his annual statement showing imports of merchandise, with the rates of duty and amounts of duty collected thereon.

James Gordon Bennett, the elder, In an editorial published in the New York Herald in 1840, when there was not a jobbing house within a mile of Clatlin's present warehouse in New York City, predicted that all the land below Canal street would soon be oeeu- Eied by wholesale trade, and advised is readers to make investments in real estate. In fifteen years from that time Claflin built his great warehouses on a plot formerly occupied by rookeries, and the predicted transformation soon became a fact. A German paper estimates that France at present owns 600 miles on the West African coast, England 850 miles, or after the annexation of the whole of the Niger delta, 1,300 miles; Portugal, 800 miles; the Republic of Liberia, 350 miles, and Germany, 750 miles. The remaining 900 mile's is owned by the natives, but will doubtless be seized by the European Powers in a short time. The coast is chiefly valuable as opening a way to the fertile interior.

Secretary Lincoln's Annual Report—More Guns Needed—Comments on General Hazen's Opinion on the Greely Expedition. a a Washington, Nov. 29. Robert T. Lin coln, Secretary of War, makes his annual report to the President. The total expen ditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1SS4. are $42,332,876 21, the appropriations, $45,570,551.53. The estimates for the fis cal year ending June 30, 1SS6, are $50,850, 500.58, being less than the estimates for 1885. Gratification is expressed that Lieutenant-General Sheridan reports that the army is now, and has been for some time past, enjoying almost absolute rest, ex cept that part of it on the frontier of Canada and Mexico and stations near the Indian Agency. The number of cadets at West Point September 1, 1884, was 314, and their conduct has been excel lent The number of patients in the Gov ernment Hospital for the Insane is 72; num ber of prisoners at the military prison, 467. It is recommended that the officer in charge of this prison be given the rank and pay of Colonel. The number of trials by general court-martial during the year was 2,280, an increase over last year of 295 ; number of convictions for desertion, 700; number of trials by garrison and regimental courts- mart ial, 10,983, an increase over last year of 1,665; total increase of trials by courts- martial ot l.you. The report of the Quartermaster-General's Department snows that at the beginning ot the last fiscal year there remained m the Treasury as balances applicable to expenses of prior years the sum of $1,295,279.01. There was appropriated for the year the sum of $10,156,734.85, including $200,000 for military posts and $2,500 for road to National Cemetery at Chattanooga, Term. The balance undrawn on the 30th of June, 1884, was $1,193,962.54. Of the $500,000 appropriated by Con gress for persons made destitute by the floods of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers $326,618.24 was expended on the Ohio and its tributaries and $160,439.34 on the Mis sissippi, leaving unexpended $12,942.42. The Uaymaster-General, In ins report, ac counts for $15,180,160.86. He recommends, with the Secretary s concurrence, that offi cers of the army be permitted to furnish the bonds of an approved guaranty company. The Chief of Engineers shows the urgent necessity of beginning at once the construc tion of coast defenses, bteel forts and tur rets to resist guns which send a projectile weighing a ton through sixty feet of sand, and which must have like guns, with ma chinery to load and manipulate them, can not be built in the time an enemy would give after the cessation of diplomatic inter course. The balance in the Treasury July 1, 1883, for improving harbors and rivers was $10,021,649.55. The amount appropriated for 1884 was $1,319,634.62, and the amount drawn from the Treasury was $8,228,703.54, leaving a balance of $3,112,580.03 in the Treasury July 1, 1884. Ot the 147 places enumerated in the River and Har bor act of August 2, 1882, seventy six were reported as not worthy of improve ment During the j-ear ending September 9, 1884, the channel of the South pass of the Mississippi River was maintained unin terruptedly. During that time $100,000 was paid for maintenance of the pass and $50,000 in interest on the $1,000,000 re tained was paid Mr. Eads, making the total expenditure for the improvement to the latter date of $5,000,000. The Secretary urges Congress to make liberal and permanent appropriations to the Ordnance Department for the purchase of gun material. The steel-makers of the coun try require the inducement of being fairly remunerated for outlays necessary to enlarge their plants sufficiently to produce st;l in masses of sufficient size and of suit able quality for gun construction. The manufactureFand test of experimental guns Will require four or rive years, and prompt action by Congress in making this appropriation and establishing Government gun factories to secure within a reasonable time efficient means of coast defense. Under the head of the Chief Signal Offi cer's report, the Secretary goes into the Greely expedition and the Proteus matter. It is given in full: "The Chief Signal Offi cer describes with sufficient detail the events connected with the closing of the work of exploration in the Arctic region and the return of the survivors of the party under Lieutenant Greely. The survivor were relieved at Cape Sabine on June 22, 1884, by a naval expedition under the com mand of Commander W. S. Schley. The zeal and enterprise of the reliev ing expedition were such as to en title all its officers and men to the highest commendation: and while it reached Cape Sabine at the earliest possible moment, the vfinal catastrophe to the few survivors of Lieutenant Greety's party was, but for the rescue, only a few hours dis tant The Greely party numbered twenty five persons of whom only seven were rescued alive and one died after the rescue. Of the dead all perished from starvation ex cept an Esquimaux, who was drowned, and Private Henry, who was executed by order of Lieutenant Greely for repeated thefts of food from the insufficient supply of the en feebled and distressed company. The Secretary of War observes with regret that the Chief Signal Officer has chosen to make in his annual report a formal express ion of opinion that, after the arrival of the wrecked Proteus party on September 13, 1883, at St. John's, there was still time, as known from previous experience and shown by subsequent facts, to send efficient relief, stating that Captain Melville and others volunteered to go, giving their full plans for the relief. A contention as to what would have been the probable result of an expedition to the Arctic regions started in the autumn, with such preparations as could be made after the middle of September, is now useless for any practical purpose,but a few words may properly be given to the subject as there may be persons whose humane considera tion for the terrible situation in which Lieutenant Greely and his party existed for months may not be accompanied by knowledge of the opinion of experienced persons as to the danger of disaster and the little hope of success of any attempt to ap proach him at that season. The Proteus party, after the wreck of that ship, reached St John's September 23, 1883. Lieutenant Garlingtou, in charge of the party, was on that day asked by tele graph whether anything more could be done that year. He replied, on September 14 "By the time suitable vessels could be pro cured, filled, provisioned, etc., it would be too late in the year. Notwithstanding this response, on the same day, by direction of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, telegram was sent to Lieutenant Garling ton asking for full replies from himself and from Commander Wildes, commanding the United States steamer Yautic, upon certain questions propounded, and further asking whether it was a feasible project to charter a steam sealer to go northward, the telegram making also some suggestions as to the out fitting of the ship and men. To this Lieu tenant Garlington replied by telegraph Sep tember i5, at length, saying, among other things: The ultimate result of any undertaking to go North at this time extremely problemat ical; chances against its success, owing to dark nights, now begun in those regions, making ice navigation extremely critical work. There is no safe winter anchorage on west shore of Greenland between Disco and Pendora Harbor, except, perhaps, North Star Bay, winter quarters of Saunders. Rowever, there is a bare chance of success, and if recommendations are approved 1 am ready nil anxious to make the effort. Under date of September 14, 1883, Chief Engineer George W. Melville, United States Navy, submitted a proposed method of re lief for the Greely party, which was in sub stance to use the steamship Yautic. but there was no suggestion in his proposition f any hope of getting the Yant i- further north than Cape York, his plan being to sledge northward from there. Under date of September 15, 1888, Dr. James Laws, who was Sm-geon in the 'Hartstone Expedi tion sent out to the relief of Dr. Kane in 1355, strongly urged the utter impractica bility, from his fc experience, of any expedition, however well fitted, being able to reach a point where it could be of the slightest service to the Gree ley party. He said that before an expedi tion could reach the shores of Greenland it would be dangerous to proceed above Disco Island. Captain George E. Tyson, who, as is well known, was with Hall's last expedi tion, and was in command of the party which floated down from the Arctic regions on an ice floe, offered his services to lead an expedition, but he made no suggestion to go ii) the autumn of 1888. On the contrary, he expressed, hi personal conference, his firm conviction of the impracticability and dan ger of undertaking such an expedition in the autumn. The . deplorable situation of the Greely party, then feared but since known to exist, did not lessen the perils which wonld have beset any relief party started at the begin ning of an Arctic winter. The Secretary of War knows of no one whose opinion would be considered, except the Chief Signal Officer, who would not have regarded such an expedition not only as substantially hope less for any relief earner than was actually given, but perilous in the extreme, if not foolhardy. Nothing is more illustrative of the im possibility of overcoming at all times the difficulty of Arctic travel, whether by land or sea, than the fact that two-thirds of Lieutenant Greely's party starved to death at Cape Sabine with 150 pounds of meat un touched at Cape Isabella, distant about thirty miles, and with 250 rations untouched at Littleton Island, at about the same dis tance, but separated by Smith's Sound. It probably never occurred to any one that the Greely party could not easily reach and use both of these stores. The conclusion reached after most anxious and careful consideration, was, on the 19th of September, 1883, embodied in a written memorandum of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy, which was given in full m the beeretary s report It may be added that the Secretary of War, while deploring the terrible loss of life incurred by the Lady Franklin Bay ex pedition, has never seen reason to doubt the propriety of these conclusions reached by the Secretary of the Navy and himself, upon all the considerations which were available to them. To some of the criticisms made by the Chief Signal Officer in his report no refer ence seems to be required beyond saying that the "Proteus " Court of Inquiry, so called, had the merit of basing its conclu sions as to the officers with whom it dealt upon such information of facts and condi tlons as was attributable by the officers themselves at the time of their action, as well as by the court But the expression of the Chief Signal Officer, above referred to, is an intrusion of an official opinion as to the propriety of the course of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy in not Hazarding more lives in 1883 in a nearly hopeless adventure, upon his telegraphic request This excursion into an official jurisdiction beyond his own and his dictum upon the exercise of a superior re sponsibility which he was not invited to share are extraordinary in their time and place, and are hardly excusable even under whatever of irritation may have been caused by the findings of the "Proteus" Court of Inquiry. Waiving, however, that considera tion, if there had at the time been given more weight to the views of that branch of the public service, uuder whose manage ment there had been one futile and one dis astrous expedition in the .Northern seas in two successive years, than to the views of men having experience in such matters, it is now hardly to be doubted that we would have had last summer the news of two Arctic calamities instead of one. It is not thought that the public would wish better evidence of this than is to be found in the official report of Commander SclUey, which the Secretary quotes. U. S.
