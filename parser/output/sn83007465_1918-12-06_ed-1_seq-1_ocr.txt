A LIVE PAPER ^ || ^ 11 A LIVE TOWN i 68TH YEAR. NO. 14. SEMI PRESIDENT GREETS A COLD CONGRESS i Half Sullen and Lukewarm Body Hears Much Heralded Address. EMBARRASSING SITUATION Republicans Sat Unmoved While President Wilson Spoke of Proposed Trip to Peace Con ference. Washington, Dec. 5.?President Wilson met a new experience whei he appeared before congress Mon day. Reading his annual message before a Joint session of the tw houses the President failed to re reive the acclaim and general up plause of previous occasions. He encountered a congress with man) openly exhibiting hostility while others were plainly engaged In manu factoring enthusiasm. T# iU* T?- IJ a Ji J * - ji me rresmeni oia not sense tno difference he was probably one of the few persons unaware of the chilly atmosphere. Newspaper men and others who have seen the President deliver more than a dozen messages ?o congress regarded the situation J as unique and embarrassing. Practically the entire Republican side sat unmoved while the Pr"-< dent spoke. The applause there when he entered and departed from the chamber was of the perfunctory sort, apparently attaching to the office of the distineu'shed spokesman in the house chamber. On the Dem ocratic side there were many mem bers of the senate who rendered grudging tributes, or none at all. The applause among Democrats o the house was more general. This was largely due to the efforts of "Representative Tom Heflin, of Ala bama, who seemed to have the role of administration cheer leader. President's Reception Lukewarm. Kven the partisan chronicler of the days events must regard the President's reception as lukewarm on the whole. Republican disapproval of th President's course in going abroa< and his neglect to taK,e members o congress into his confidence, put a damper upon the entire assemblage This disapproval is hy no means con fined to the Republican membership of congress, but the Democrats as a Tule are more tolerant in their views. The different receptions accorded the President was regrettable from more than one angle. It came just 'before the President sails for tho peace conference, to which he should KO with the plaudits of the entire nation echoing in his ears. It suffered severely by contrast with the acclaim given the President when he appeared before congress less than a month ago and read the harsh nrmlstice terms accepted by German) and announced that "thus the war comes to an end." Half of Congress in Sullen Mood. When the President appeared a the caplthl on that occasion tha ncene was a memorable and inspir lng one. With few exceptions* mem bars of congress were unstinted In the approbation. Monday the President found half of congress revealing a sullen mood and the other half accentuating that sullenness by attempting to stage demonstrations comparable to those of former occasions. Unquestionably it was embarrass lng to the President's friends, and f probably to Mr. Wilson, to note that while about one-third or one-half o the legislators present arose and In terrupted bis message by applause the remainder of the legislative as semblage was sulking.' The Republicans, both of the sen nte and house, sat stolidly In their; seats, with arms folded or inert and With no flntinfiHnn nr annrnnlaMAi I showing on their faces. Quite a num her of the Democratic senators wen apathetic and left to their more emn tional house brethren the stAging of Intermittent demonstrations In Mr Wtlaon'a honor. It wan noted, for Instance that Senator Martin, of Virginia. Domo eratlc leader of the senate, showed no enthusiasm during the President'* address. Upon occasions he con versed In a whisper with Senttor > Lodge, ranking Republican of the HE L

Mr. Bryan wired from Jacksonville, Fla., early this morning that he would give a "y positive answer to the invitation tomorrow after reaching his home at Ashevllle. The likelihood is A that he will attend. Others speakers will be Judge Patterson, chairman of the Georgia state highway commission; and Captain Gaillard. president of the Portland Cement company. ti Ii foreign relations committee, who sat u near him. H Senator Martin Has No Comment. a After the President's message Sen g ator Martin declined to make auy n comment whatever upon the Presi j, dent's annual mssage. A simila j course was pursued by Seator Lodge c who is known to be piqued becaus \ the President has not called into con- j, sultation members of the foreign re ? Nations committee prior to his de pr.rture for the peace conference. I; The fact that the constitution de M signates the senate as one-half of the nation's treaty-making power and it must ratify any peace nego 'ated by the President, has Incured senate resentment that the Presi j dent has remained aloof from its ad p vice p?d that no member of the > - , - ?nber is to go to the peace ^ conferenre. G Democratic comment on the Pies ident's message was along the gen- ^ eral line that it was an excellent s state paper, etc. As a rule the Dem- g ocratic commentators made slight or no reference to the failure of the President to detail his plans and c reasons for attending the peace conference. Republican comment we p openly critical. That 's when a Re- j publican talked for quotation he j was critical and when he said things not for publication he was bitter, ex ^ tremely cynicai and occasionally q somewhat profane.

AT BOTTOM OF THE LISTJ Manager of Division Has Pledged South to Show It is as Loyal as New England States. The following letter has been received by J. H. Witherspoon, ReJ Cross Roll Call chairman for Lancaster county, from E. R. Black, manager of the Southern Division, relative to the membership drive to be carried on December 16 to 23: "In connection with your Christmas Roll Call I want to call your attention to an incident and a promise. "At n Th./I ? 1 - XT ? V ? .?vu V/I lino Hireling III ixew York recently the blackboard contained the names of each division, the population of each division, the number of members of the Red Cross in each division, and the percentage in each division of members of the Red Cross to the population. The New England division had about ten million population, three million three hundred thousand members in the Red Cross, and showed a percentage of membership of thirtythree per cent. The other divisions followed with large memberships. The southern division was last. it showed a population of about ten million, membership about six hundred thousand, having a percentage of membership to population of six per cent. "I was greatly eharrassed at thesefigures. I realize that in our division we have a large negro population and a large rural population. These two facts however, furnish no excuse for our low membership. They are rather conditions which, make our work harder, but which can be overcome. At this meeting I grew restive under the situation shown hv these figures. I promised that meeting?that if they would forget those figures of the southern division and would have another meeting in January I would give them the answer of the southern division to the < h a'lenire of the fienros nrnaent. pel by the Now England division, and | I pledged that th!s answer would show that the southern people we'd ! iust as responsive to the call of the Pod Cross as were the New England people. This means that I have pledged out division to quadruple its present membership. "I tell you of this incident and this pledere in order to let you kno.Nf that the honor of our division is at\ stake. It is with the utmost confldenre that I call upon you to exe't every effort to help me keep this pledge made in your behalf as well as in my own behalf. This pledge can he kept if you and the other loyal Poll Call chairmen in our division feel with me that the south in its warm-hearted purposes Is equal to any other section of thi9 country. I am not going to say any more. I call you whole-heartedly to help me redeem my pledge.
