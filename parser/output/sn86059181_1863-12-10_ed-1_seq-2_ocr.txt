THURSDAY ......DECEMBER 10 K- M. THAYER, Editor. J. H. SILVERTHORX, Associate. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow-Citizens of the Senate mmd ZfoM RtpretcrUaUvtt i Another year of health and of suffi ciently abundant harvests has passed. For theae,&Dd especially for an improved condition of our national affairs, our re newed and proper gratitude to God is due. We remain in peace and friend ship with foreign powers. The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in foreignwars, to aid inex cusable insurrection, have been unavail- fler Brittanic Majesty's Government, as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of hostile expeditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neu trality, which he proclaimed at the be ginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy and im portance have arisen out of the blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the Government and several of the mari time powers, bnt they have been dis cussed, and, so far as was possible, ac commodated, in a spirit of frankness, justice and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying that our Prize Courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the re spect and confidence of maritime powers. The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain fo the suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 18th day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and barba rous traffic has been brought to an end. I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the adjust ment of possessory claims in Washing ton Territory, arising out of the treaty of tne iota ot June, tsw, between the Uni ted 8tates and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country. A novel and important question, in volving the extent of the maritime ju risdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the Island of Cuba, has been debated, without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed in an amicable spirit to refer it tothe arbitrament of a friend ly Power. A convention for that par pose, will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought proper to subject to the approval f the Senate, to concur with the interested Commercial Powers, in an arrangement for the liquidation of Scheldt dues, upon'prineiples which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili, touching the seizure at Silona in Peru by Chilian officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States, has been brought to a close hy the award of his Majesty, the King of the Belgian'?, to whose arbitra tion the question was referred by the parties. Ihe subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and," although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been 'as large as they expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his Majesty's decision. That decis ion waspronrptly complied with by Chi ii, iiuui? imuiiinnii'm xeguru UJ 15 reached that country. The joint commission under the act of the- last session for carrying into effect the convention with Peru, on the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima and is engaged in the business entrusted to it Difficulties concerning the inter-oceanic transit through Nicaragua, are in course of amicable adjustment, in conformity with the principle set forth in my last annual message. I have received the representative from the United States of Columbia, and have accredited a Miuister to that Republic. Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war, have forcef upon my atten tion the uncertain state of fnternation al questions touching the rights of foreigners in this country, and of United States' citizens abroad. In re gard to some governments, these rights are, at least partially, defined by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that, on the instance of civil war. a foreiffter residing in this country, within the lines of the insurgents, is to he exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the Government of his country cannot expect any privileges or immunities from that character. 1 regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some in Btances.in behalf of foreigners who have hved in the United States for the great er part of their Uvea There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries, who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully natural ized, have evaded the military dntv re quired of them, by denying the fact, and thereby throwing upon this government the burden of proof Jt has been fdlnd difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want .of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the clerks of courts where a declaration of inten tion may be made or naturalization ef fected, to send periodically lists of the names of persons naturalized, or declar ing their intention to become citizens, '.o the Secretary of the Interior, in whose Department these names must be arranged and printed for gen eral information. There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently be come citizens of the United States, for the sole purpose of evading the duties imposed by the laws of their native couq try, to which, after becoming naturalized here, they at once repair, and though never returning to the United States, they still claim the interposition of this Government aa citizens. Many altera tions and great prejudices have hereto fore arisen oat of this abuse. It is, thetefcr, submitted to tout considera tion. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States, residing abroad, may claim the interposition of this Govern ment The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens, under pretense of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into tne military service. I sebmit the expediency of ?uch an amendment of the laws, as will make the fact of .voting an estoppel against any claim of exemption from military service, or other civil obligations on the ground of alienage. In common with the Western Powers, on relations with Japan have been put in serious jeopardy, through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the Empire, to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring that country into the society of na tions. It is to be hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difn calties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there, for the dam ages he sustained in the destruction by r- r. .1 . . . .. - . . . nre oi ine residence ot the Legation At leaao. r Satisfactory arr; ! men: - have been made with the em; r of I ;;: which, it is believad. will result in t-ffecinz a continuorrt line -of Tlf raph tlirtwgU tnat tmpire trom our racihe cost I recommend to your Favorable consid eration the subject of an international teiegrapn between this uapitai ana tne National Forts on the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Such constw tions.established with a reasonable outlay, would be economical ae well as effective aids to the diplomatic, military and na val service. . The Consular system of the United States, nnder the enactments of the last Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so, with the increase of trade which will ensne when peace is re stored. Our ministers abroad have been faith ful in defending American rights. In- protecting our commercial inter terfsts, oar consuls necessarily have to encounter increased labors and respon sibilities growing ont of the war. These they have, for the most part, met and lisclBrged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgment justly includes those consuls residing in Morocco, Egypt, Chi na and other" central countries, and are charged with complications and extraor dinary powara. The condition of the several organ ized Territories jg generaiy satisfactory, although the Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The Mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idahoe, Xew Mexico and Arri zonia are proving far richer than hereto fore understood. I lay before you com munications on this subject on ths Gov ernment ot ew Mexico: I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a' system for the encouragement of emigration. Althongh this source of national wealth is Bowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection oc cured, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, espec ially in agriculture and in our mines as well of iron and coal as of precious met als. While the demand for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands desti tute of remuneration and . occupation are thronging our foreign consulates and offering to emigrate to the United States it essential but very cheap assistance can be afforded them It is easy to see that under the sharp discepline. 'of ;ivif war the nation is begining a new life. This noble effort demands the aid, and ought to receive the attention and sup port of the Government Injuries, nnforseen by the Govern ment, and unintended, may in some cases have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both on sea and on land, by persons in the ser vice of the United States. Ae this Gov ernment expects redress from Other Pow ers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the exist ing Judicial tribunals are inadequate for this purpose, a special Court may be au thorised, with power to hear and decide such claims, of the character referred to as may; nave arisen under the treaties and the public laws. Conventions for adjusting claims by your commission have been proposed to some Govern ments, but no definite answer to these propositions has yet been received from any. In the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants. Decrees of restitution have been ren dered, and damages awarded by the Ad miralty court, and in other cases where this Government may be acknowledged to oe iij.uic iu j,i incline, uuciwucii uv amoSnt of that liability has been enter tained byn informal arbitration lliai The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the United States, on the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of Foreign Consuls in this country. While such a demand may not be an indica tion of public law, or perhaps of iry existing treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expedi ency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such Consuls, ns are not oitiaens of the Uni ted States, derived from the emoluments of their office. o from property not sit uated in the United States, is submitted to your sarious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity that ought to be reciprocated, exempts oar Counflabj in all other coun tries from taxation. To the extent thus indicated the Uni ted States, I think, ought not to be ex ceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.' ' I!M nfni The operations of the Treasury during the last year have been suc cessfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking law, has proved a valuable support of the pub lic credit, and the' general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectatibnV of its favorers. Spme amendments may be required, to perfect existing laws, but no change in their principles or general scope, is believed to be needed. Sice these measures have been in op eration all demands on tho Treasury, in cluding pay of the army and navy, have been promptly met arid fully satisfied No considerable body of troops, it is be lieved, was ever more amply provided for, more liberally and punctually paid, and it may be added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war more cheerfully borne.

It is sufficient to say here that it i not Deneved that the actunl results will ex hibit a state of the finances, less favor able to the country than the estimates of that office heretofore submitted. While it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both the disbursements and debts will be found very consider ably less than has been anticipated i he report of the Secretary of War is a document of great iatfrMCv fj 1 ii i It consists ot, 1st, the military opera lions of the year detailed in the report of the General-in-Chief 2nd, tho or- sl isrtam issig 'sub OS t ,l i mwl . . - - Mnacc.

It has appeared impossible'! to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content myself witbreferring your attention to the re port iteelf. The duties devolving on the nataCbranch of the(T-ervici .during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been con stantly increasing in efficiency, as the navyaas expanded. let on so long a line it has, so larj.oeen impossible to entirety suppress illicit trade. From the returns received at thftrXavy Department, it ap pears that more than 1,000-Te.ssei.s have been captured since the blockade was in stituted, andht the value of the prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over $13,000,000. The naval force of the United States consists at this time of 588 .vessels, com pleted and in course of construction, and of these 75 ore iron clad, armored steam ers. J 1 J2 The events of the war gave an in creaied interest and importance to the Navy which will probably expend beyond the war itself. J?. i . f 2 Thj? armed vessels in onr navy cora- i pleted and in service, or under contract ana approacnieig completion, are benev-edt-xeeed in number those of nny other power. While they may be relied upon for harbor defence and seacoast service, othewof greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purpqes and to maintain our rightful pos ition on the ocean. The change that haa taken place in naval warfare since the in troduction of steam as a motive power for ships .of wardemands either a corres ponding change in some of our existing navy yards, or the establishment of new. ones, for the construction and necessary repair ot modern war vessels. ro in considerable embarrassment, delay and public injury have befcp experienced from the want of such Gdrrernment establish ments. The necessity of such a navy yanrr so famished, at some snitable place upon the .Atlantic seaboard, has, on re peated occasions, been brought to the at tention ot Congress by the Navy Depart- ment, anu'is again presented in the re port of the Secretary, -which accompanies this communication. I think it my duty to invite yonr special attention to this subject, and also that of the establishment of a Yard and Depot, for naval purposes, upon oe of tho Western rivers. A na val force ha been created on these in terior waters, and under many disadvan tages, within little mote than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commence ment of the present administration. Sat isfactory and important a3 have been the performances of the heroic men of the navy at this period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the servi ces of onr mechanics and citizens in the production of war vessels, which has cre ated a new form of naval power. Our country has advantages superior to any other nation, in our rofioojrfcs of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quanti ties of fuel in the immediate vicin ity of both, and all accessible and in close proximity to navigable waters without the disadvantage of pub He risks. The resources of the nation have been developed and its power display ed U-the"con8triction of t navy:ot ioeh uiajimiiwr, -wmvit iia, . mr "Ty pen- od of its creation rendered signal service to the Union. . The increase of the num ber of seamen in the public service from 7,000 men in the Spring of 1861, to about 24000 at the present time, has been accomplished without special legislation or extraordinary bounties to cromote that increase. Tt has been found, howev er, that the operations of the draft with high bounties paid for army recruits, is begining to effect, injurioosly the naval service and will, if not corrected, be like ly to impair its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the arm-. 1, therefore, resjectiWy suggest that Con gress might aid both the army and na val service by adequate provision on this subject which would at the same time be equitable to the communities more es pecially interested. 1 commend to your coisideratipn the suggestions of the Secretary of the N.vy, in regard to the policy of fossrering and Graining seamen for naval servfee. The aval Academy is rendering signal ser- vice in preparing miasnipmen lor highly responsible duties, which in after"life they will be required to perform. In or der that the country should not be de- prived of the proper quota oUeducated officers for which legal provision has been made at the naval school, the va cancies caused by the neglect or omis sion to make nominations from the States. in insurrection,, have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than at any previous period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congress. During the past year the financial con dition of the Post Office Department has been one of increased prosperity, and I am gratided to be able to state that the accounts of Postal Revenue has nearly equaled the entire expenditure, the latter amounting to 1 l,ol4.000.84, and the former to f Il.loo, (8V.-W, leaving a de-' hciency of bdtf 150,41 i.2T. In 1860, the Jear immediately preceding the rebel ion, the deficiency amounted to $5,656, 705.4'J. The posjal receipts of that jear were f2.645,722.:i!i less than those of 1862. The decrease, since I860, in the annual amount of tranjportation. has been only about 25 per cent, but the annn al expenditures, on account of the same, have been reduced 35 per cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration ot the whole seryico. The international conference of postal dolega'es from the principal countries of Europe and America which was called at the suggestion of. the Post Master General met at Paris on the 11th of May last and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of July. The principles es tablished by the conference as best ad apted to facilitate postal intercourse be tween nations aud aa the baais of future conventions, t inaugurate .a general system of uniform international charges, at reduced rates of postage, cannot fail to produce beneficial reeustptrO : I refer you to the report of the Secre tary of the Interior, which is herewith laid before yon, for rae useful and varied information in relation to the public lands, Indian, affairs, Patents, Pensions, and other matters of public concern per- i tity of lands disposed of during theTast raining 10 mis uepariment. lnaquan and first quarters of the present fiscal ear was o.s41,'5'.' acres, of which 131. -911 acres were sold for cash; 1,466,514 acres were taken up under the Home stead law, and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for nxititary bounties, railroads, and other purposes. It also appears that the sale of public lands is largely on the increase. It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest stateemen, that the people of the United States had a higher and more enduring interest ganiialion of colorea persons m tne war in th? enrlr settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be de rived from the sale of them. This opin ion has had a controlling influence in 'innin;: legislation upoa the subject of our national domain. I may cite, as an instance of this, the liberal measures adopted. in reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their limits, in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railroad companies of alternate sections of lands upon the contemplated lines of their roads which, when completed, will largely mul tiply the facilities of reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received its most signal and beneficial illustra tion in the recent enactments granting homesteads to actual settlers. Hi nee the first day of January last the before men tioned quantity of 1,450,514 acres of land had been taken up under its pro visions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish a gratifying evidence of the increasing settlements upon the pub lic lands, notwithstanding the great strug gle in which the energies of the nation haVe been engaged, and which has re quired so large a withdrawal of our citi zens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, suggest ing a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the United States. T doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essential ly changing the general features "of the system, secure, to the greatest practica ble cxtept, its benefits to those who have left their homes in defense of their coun try in this arduous crisis. I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary of War as to the propriety of raising by appropriation of the Leg islature a revenue from the mineral lands of the United States. The measures provided at yonr last session for the removal of certain Indian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional action of the Seuate. They contain stipulations for extin guishing the possessiouary rights of the Indiana to large and valuable tracts of land. It is probable that the effects of these treaties will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of those tribes as have been brought in- to trequent and bloody collision with our out-lying settlements and emigrants. The sound poiiev and our imperative duty to those Wards of the government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material well being, to their pro gress in the arts of civilization and aboye all to that moral training, which, under the blessings of Uivioe Providence, will confer upon them the elevating and sanctifying influence of the hopes and consolations of the Christian faith. I suggested in uiy last annual message the propriety of remodeling this Indian sys tem. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary will evince the urgent need of immediate Legislative action. 1 commend the benevolent institutions established or patronized by the Govern ment in this District to your generous and fostering care. The attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communications between the Mississippi and the Northern Atlantic seaboard, which proposition failed for the time. Since which time, on a call of the great est respectability, a Convention has been called at Chicago, upon the same subject, the summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the President Bim oongicsM, mm nincu J uow nave Uic honor to iay before you. That this inter est is one which will ere long force its 0 n way, I do not entertain a doubt While it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done, now, augmented interest is given to this sub ject by the actual commencement of work on the Pacific Railroad, under aus pices favorable to its rapid progress and completion. Enlarged navigation be comes a palpable need to this great road. Itransmit the Second Annua! Report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention tothe developments in that vital interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with va rying results, j a H The rebellion had been'pre'ssed back into reduced limits, yet the tone of pub lic feeling at home and abroad was not satisfactory. With other signs, the pop ular elections just past, indicated uneasi ness among ourselves, while amid much that was told and menacing, the kindest words coming trom England were utter- j cd in accents of pity that we were too Olind to surrender. Uur commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and farnished from foreign shores, and we wer threatened with such additions from the same quar ter as would sweep our trade from the sea and- raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European govern ments anything hopeful upon this sub ject. The Emancipation proclamation, which was issued in September, was running its assigned period to the be ginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that .... V 1 r .. 1. 1 . , . colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of emancipation, and the employment of black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which hopes, fears and doubts, contended in nncertain conflict According to our political system, as a matter of civil ad ministration, the General Government has no lawful power to effect emancipa tion in any State, aud for a long time it bad been hoped tho rebellion could have bean suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come and that if it should the crisis of the contest would then be presented. It came, and i as intended. It was followed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months have been passed. We are permitted to take an other review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi River the country dominated over by the rebellion is divided into dis tant parts, and practical communication between them severed. Teunessee and Arkansas have been so substantially cleared of insurgent control and influ ence, that citizens in each, who were the owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emaucipation in their respective States. Of those States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, in Mary land and Missouri, neither of which, years ago, would tolerate any whispering on the extinction of slavery fn their territories, the only dispute now is aa to the best mode of removing it from their own limits. Of those who were slaves at the begin ning' of the rebellion, folly 100,000 are now in the United States military ser vice, about one-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thug giving the double, advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause, and supplying the places which other wise mnst be filled with so many white men. So far as tested, it ia difficult to, say they are not ar good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty lias marked the measure of emancipation, ahdmrmitig the blacks. Isu . JK fa. - These measures have been much dis cussed in foreign countries, and cotem porary with such discussions the tone of the public sentiment there was much im proved. While the same measures have been fully discassed, supported, critioized and denounced7the annual elections are especially encouraging to those whose special duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we have the reckouiug. The crisis which threat ened to divide the friends of the Union is passed. poni' if a leo Looking now to the present and the fu ture, and with reference to-a resumption of the National authority within those States wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought lit to issue a .Proclamation, a copy of which i here with transmitted. Upon examination of this proclamation, it will appear, as is believed, amplv justified by the Constitu tion. True, the form of an oath is given, yet no man is coerced to take it. A nmu is only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Consti tution authorizes the Executive to grant it on terms as fully established by judi cial and other authority. It is also proposed that if any of the States named desire to reunite with the Government, it shall be in the mode pre scribed and set up. Such Governuient shall be recognized and guaranteed by the United States, and that-under it the State shall, on subscribing to the consti tutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the United States to guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form of government and to protect the same, is explicit and full But why tender the benefits of this proclamation only to a State government set up in this particular way I liius sec tion of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to a Repubheau government in the Union may be too feebla for an opposite and hostile element external to. and even within the State; and such arc precisely the case with which we are now,. dealing. An attempt to guarantee and protect a revised state of Government constructed in wlioie or in a preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and vio lence it is to be protected, ig simply ab surd. I here must be a test by winch to separate the opposing elements so as to build only from the sound one: and that test is a sufficient and liberal ,oy,e, which accepts as sound wuoevcr win maKe a sworn recantation of his former unsound ness. Uut it it be proper to requixe a test ot admission to the political body. an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States aud the Union uuder it, why not also to the law and proclama tion in regard to slavery? Those laws and proclamation were enacted and put lortn ior wc 'purpose 01 aiumg 111 tne suppression of the rebellion, io give them the tultest ettect, there baa to be plege lor tneir mauuuir.cinee. i;i my judgement they have aided aud will fur ther aid the cause for which they were enacted. Togiveupthis principle would be not only to rolinquish a lever ol' pow er but it wcraia also oc a crnei ana as tounding breach ef faith. I mar odd. at tins point, tnai wnne 1 rem;. m m my present position I shall not attempt to retract or inoduy Uiei!.inancirtion Proclamation, nor shall 1 return to slavery any person who is made free by the terms of the Proclamation, or by any net of Congress, r or these and otber reusoifs it is thought best that the support, ot theso persuua enuu oe iriciuueo. in rap oatn anil it. tfl hpllPVPrl thit f lip f.Y-irt!nr ,t,o claim it in retnrn for pardon and restor.a- tiou of torleitcd rights, whlcu he h.i.; clear constitutional power to withhold altogether, or gr.ant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest fop-pullic intrer It should be oSservod also that thiTpart of the oath is subject to the ..modifying and abrogating power of legislation. The proposed acjjuiescsiMie of the Na tional Executive in any honorable tem porary State arrangement for the freed; people, is made with a view of possibly modifying the confusion, distress and destitution which must at last attend all classes, by a total revolution of labor throughout the whole State. It is hoped the already deeply afflicted in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction, and to this extent This vital matter is left to them selves. While no power of the National Execntive to prevent an abuse 13 abridg ed by this proposition, the suggestion in in the proclamatiou, as to maintain ing the political framework of the States on what is called reconstruc tion, is made in the hope that it may do good without harm. It will favor labor and avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation now, upon this subject? This question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon. In some, the elements for resumption have been ready for action, but remain inactive ; apparently for want or a rallying point a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that of A? And if A and B should agree, how can t.hpv know that the fiener.il (iiivcrnmAni here will respecttheir plan. By the Pro- elamation, a plan is presented wL may be accepted by them as a rallying rpoint and which they are assured in ad I r . . . ... , vance win not be rejectea nere. ihis may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive, consists in the dan ger of commitments in points which could be more safely left to further de velopments. Care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embar rassment from this source. Iu saying that on certain terms certain .classes will be pardoned, with their rights re stored, it is not said that other classes on other terms will never be included. In tayhrg that a reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a spec ified way, it is not said that it will never be accepted in any other way. The movements by State actions for emancipation in several of the States not included in the Emancipation Proc lamation, are matters of profound con gratulation, and while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnest ly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings remain unchanged, and I trust that Congress wiH opiit no fair opportunity of aiding tnese import ant steps to the great consummation. In the midst ot' other cares, however important, we must not lose sight of the fact tL-t the War Power is still our main reliance. To that power alone ean we look yet for a time, to give confidence to the people in the contested regions that the insurgent power will not again over run them. Cntii that confidence shall be established, little can be done any-' where for what is called reconstruction Hence onr chiefest cake must still be di rected to our army and navy, who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well, and it may be esteemed fortu nate that in giving the greatest efficien cy to their indispensable arms, we do , also honorably encourage gallant men, from commander to Ren-tineT, who com pose them, and to whom, more, than .all others, the world must stand indebted for tbe home of freedom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged and perpetuated.

I. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare and make known to all persons wbo haye directly, or by implication,- par ticipated in the existing rebelliou, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is granted to them, and each of them, for the restora tion of all their rights, if third parties shall have intervened and upon the condi tion that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation and shall be of the tenor and effeet of the following, to wit : I do solemnly swear in presence of Almighty God that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the -United States and the Union of the States therunder, and that I will in like manner abide by, and faith fully support all acta of Congress passed during the existing rebellion with refer ence to slaves so loug and so far as not yet repealed, modified or held void by Congress or by decision of the Supreme Court And that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully support all the proclamations of the President, made during the existing rebellion, having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of tho Supreme Court So help me '(Sod. , The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or dit lomatio officers or agents of the so-called Confederate Government; all who have left Judicial positions under the United States to aid tne rebellion, or vho shall have been military or n-jval officers of the rank of Colonel in the army or Lieutenant in the navy. All who left seats in the United States Congress 'o aid in the rebellion. All who resign ed their commissions in the army and navy of the United States, and afterwards ' aided the rebellion. And all who have en gaged in any way in treating colored per- 1 sons, or white persons in charge of such, oHktwho thfin lawfully as prisoners of t j ji- 1. . . . war, aim wnicu persona may De lounu 111 t,,c United States service as soldiers, Seamen, or in ahy other capacity. And I do further proclaim, declare aiid make known that whenever iu any of the States ol'Arkansas-jTexaSjLoiiisiana.Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Sonth'Carolihii and North Carolina, a number of persona, not less than one tenth of the number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential slection in the year of our Lord, 1860, each hav ing taken the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by tho election laws of the State existing immediately before the so:called act of secession and excluding all others, Bhall establish a State gov ernment, which shall be Republican in form, and no wise contravening eaid oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, shall receive there "under the benefits of the constitutional provision, which declares that the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect them against invasion, ou application of the Legislature, or Executive, when the Legislature cannot be convened, against domestic violence. And I do further proclaim, declare and make known, that any further provision which may be adopted by said State government, in relation to the freed people of such State, it shall re cognize and declare them permanently freed, and shall provide for their edu catiou, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their- present condition as a laboring, landless a,1l homeless class, wiil not be objected to by the National Executive. And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal Stats government in any State, the name, the boundary, the subdivision, the constitution and the fed eral code of laws, as before the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to modi fications made necessary by the condi tions hereinbefore stated and such others, if any, contravening said conditions which may be deemed expedient by those fram ing the new State Government. To avoid misunderstanding it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to State Governments, has core ference to States wherein loyal State Governments have all tbe while been maintained, and for the same reason it may be proper to further say that when their members of Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats constitu tionally rests exclusively with the ! respective Houses, and not to any extent witu the .executive; and still further, that this proclamation is in tended to present to the people of the States therein the national authority has been suspended, and loyai State Govern ments have been subverted, a mode by which the national authority over every loyal State Government may be estab lished within said States, or any of them. Aad while the mode presented is the best the Executive can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be un derstood that another possible mode would not be acceptable. Given ander my hand, at the City of i Washington, this 8th day of December, Anno Domini, one thousand cijrht 4iun- i dred and sixty-three, and of the Inde- penitence ot lite united states ot Amei ica, eighty-eight.
