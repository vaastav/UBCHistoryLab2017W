There seems to be a marriage wave j sweeping over Newberry; the marri- j age habit is 'spreading and becoming ; epidemic.

Miss Lila Summer entertained on Friday afternoon in honor of Miss Carolyn Caldwell, who on Wednes- ; day becomes the bride of Mr. Claude ' Sligh. Thirty-five guests were pre-' sent and joined in wishing the guest i of honor all the happiness of the world. Delightful refreshments were . served and the lovely home was enhanced bv the blooming bulbs and rosy cheeks of the many pretty girls, present. The dwelling known as the Proctor ? Todd house, in Vincent street just; across the railroad tracks, now i owned and occupied by Mrs. Will i JBedenbaugh, was damaged by a fire ; which started at 4:15 o'clock on! Thursday afternoon, in the overhead j ceiling of the second story, burning ! ?oiii"nor anH the roof of the build-! Li 1 W ing. Most of the damage to the 1 household effects was done by the 1 water. The promptness and good j work of the fire department saved j the building from destruction and j proved the efficacy of the pump on the fire truck. Friday's State reported the follow-! ing pleasant news item: "Reedy! River association has the honor of? having subscribed the largest per 1 capita amount of $96, while Abbeville comes a close second with $90. In the Reedy River the churches are largely in the country with the exception of the Newberry churches, and > /* . 1 officials of the canvass are gratmea | at the showing made by that associa- j tion.".

He was not charged with j oerit larcenv. but they made it dis- j orderly conduct, wishing to be as I easy on him as possible. We uphold j the officials in their generous treatment of the feeble and needy old soldier. The building occupied by The Herald and News office and other business firms at the corner of Califwell and Friend streets has been sold by the Exchange bank to Miss Anne 0. Ruff for $10,000. Miss Ruff is one of the leading business women of iVewherrv and understands the art of j money making, being well versed in the ways of the successful pursuer of fortune. The building she has just bought is in a desirable loca- i tion and is a good place for any j business. She shows her foresight by h's purchase, as she will save rent cn her store, and saving rent in these j ilays of "high cost of rent" is worth j javir/-. ' { CAPITAL NEW * (By John Columbia, Dec. 14.?The general assembly, which convenes on January 13. is sroing to try an interesting ex periment this year in regard to the appropriation biil?experiment, so far as this state is concerned, though -the budget system is recognized in a good many other states, and in his recent message to Congress President Wilson recommended a budget system for the federal government. The budget commission appointed by the last session of the general assembly has been busy whipping into sjiape a budget for the year 1920, to be presented to the coming session of the legislature. The commission is composed of the governor, with the assistance of the chairman of the ways and means committee of the house and the chairman of the finance committee of the senate, who hold public hearings during the month of November, to determine the needs of the various state departments and institutions. Estimaes are furnished the governor by the comptroller general, and a budget is to be submitted by the governor within five days after the legislature convenes. Within five days thereafter the ways and means committee of, the house* and the finance committee of the senate are to begin joint meetings to consnhmit.t.ed. Of UCI tllW 

VUU^W w*w course the legislature is not bound in any way by the budget, but the idea is 10 get the whole .matter on some kind of definite basis upon which to work, and also to get the appropriation. bill into the legislature and out of the way before the closing hours of the session. Senator Christensen, of Beaufort, is chairman of the finance committee of the senate, and Representative Bradford, of Yorfo is chairman of the ways and means committee 01 tne house. On account of Senator Christensen's recent illness, from which he has recovered, Senator Ketchiri, of Fairfield, took his place at the hearing recently held in Columbia. The working- . cf the budget law be watched with considerable interest. Heretofore it has been the custom for the ways and means committee of the house to hold headings and frame, the appropriation bill, which has always been introduced late in the session, and after the bill is passed by the house, it goes to the finance committee of the senate, which remodels it and sends it in to the senate. For several years, however, the committees of the two houses have been holding their hearings in joint session, to save time af ter the bill reaches the senate committee. Tko wishe" of the senate have generally largely prevailed in the matter of appropriations for some years past. At several sessions in recent years the house has threatened to reject the report of the free conference committee, to which the bill is sent to adjust the differences between the two houses after the1 senate rewritten the house bill. To reject the report of this committee would m ?an that the appropriation bill would die, and the legislature wpuld hrv to remain in session and pass another one, or the governor would have to call an extra session for that purpose. The house, however, has never carried out its threat, but the report of the free conference committee has always been adopted in the final rush hours of the session. If the budget system will bring about consideration of the appropriation bill earlier in the sfessjon, even if it accomplishes nothing else, it will be well worth while. The appropriation measure as it finally comes from conference, carrying millions of dollars, is now rushed through at the very close of the session, oftimp* in the hours between midnight and daybreak, with sometimes only a scattering attendance of members. nnrJ it would be incalculably better to dispose of the measure earlier in the session, both on account of it? importance, and to clear the decks for constructive legislation. mi T~ ? rt ^AAri 1 nnfj. i nere rias uccu <x uvui woman suffrage literature coming into South Carolina from Alabama, and some of it is very interesting. It has caught the attention of the suffragists in this State, an J there have been some replies to it in the press. Opinions vary as to what course the legislature will pursue in this regard. It may decide to let the matter lie over until the next session, and give the people of the State an opportunity to express themselves in the election this summer. Perhaps that would be the best solution of the entire matter. This thing of legislatures voting away the rights of the states without submitting the ques ion to the people is a serious matier. This proposition has nothing to do with the question of woman suffrage, but only in the matter of its bestowal. Already the state has surrendered ics police power to the federal government in the matter of the prohibi'k.n amendment, and to vote to ratify a sV.ui'Mza amendment would he another long step in the relinquish ???? I SAND GOSSIP ' J K. Aull.) i ment of rights reserved by the states J I in the framing of the constitution, j t Already there is talk of the politi- i j cal campaign the coming summer, and \ i considerable speculation as to the ( j probable candidates. It is not prob- j able that Governor Cooper will be ' j opposed for re-election as governor, j ! The Lexington-Dispatdh News says j i that "there hg!s been a rumor that j his excellency would enter the lists i against Senator Smith for the United J ' States senate," but it is generally j l expected that Governor Cooper will j i be a candidate for a second term. | There has so far been no definite I . announcement of any opposition to j ! Senator Smith, though the names of | ; several gentlemeif have been spoken j of in this connection. There have been some speculation ; as to candidates in opposition to | Congressman Mann, of this district, : who was elected to fill th3 unexpired I term of Congressman Lever. Among ! j those mentioned are Mr. H. P. Fulmer I of Orangeburg, and Solicitor George . Bell Timmerman of Lexington, both | of whom were candidates against Mr. j Mann. It has been stated that Mr. ^ tTr-i 11 nnnnco Mr Iyj C" LH V U3 VU1ICU vv m Vf^uuv Junius T. Liles for reelection as lieutenant governor. I There is not as much political talk at this time as there usually is on ,the eve of campaign year. i ? The anti-saloon league wants to t raise $400,000 in South Carolina for j the enforcement of prohibition and to carry the prohibition gospel to 1 Cuba and South America, and else. where. With prohibition a law by j federal . enactment, and with the ! strong arm of the federal government I guaranteeing its enforcement to the extent of the government's ability, it i would seem that $400,000 is a pretty I big amount to ask South Carolina to | contribute to a private organization to help out the government, which is j taxing the people for that very purpose. Surely foreign countries can regulate ?' their own police affairs. Possibly, however, soft jobs are going glimmering . unless the anti-saloon leaguers can launch new propaganda. j This is said ***'th ^"e + I a number * of faithful prohibition | workers, who have twe \,<uare 01 hnmftnit.v at heart, but without re spect to the pap-suckers in the ranks. TO BUILLD COLORED SCHOOL IN MT. BETHEL-GARMANY At the request of the board of trustees of the Mt. Bethel-Garmany school district I went on last Thursday night, as bad as was the weatjjer. to the Pleasant Grove colored church to talk with the colored people in regard to the school work and to urge them to cooperate with the* trustees and do some work themselves and to out up some money so that they might have a suitable house in which to ! teach the school. The weather was cold and raining, | but I went. We drove by the home of | Mr. B. B. Leitzsey, one of the trustees of the district, and he went along and so did Misses Nickles and Young the two young ladeis who are teaching at Mt. Bethel-Garmany. Mr. 1 John Oxner, another of the trustees of the district was presentNand des | pite the bad weather there was a very j good crowd gathered, some 50 or 75. ! And there was a good fire and the 1 colored people have a very nice . church at this place. , The purpose of the meeting was to interest the colored people in the mat- | ter of doing something themselves to help secure a new building and to . supplement any aid that may be 5 available from outside sources. Mr. ' | Leitzsey presided and made a good talk to the people and then I talked ' to them and tried to point out their opportunity and their duty at this time and U. S. Gallman the supervisor i of colored schools talked very sensibly < and told them what the colored people . of Vaughnville had done and what? a J nice building they have at that place, I and that the way for these people to < do was to get busy and help themselves by their money and their work i I and then they could get outside help. I j There are some 250 children and they ; I have but one house in the district for < the colored people that '"amounts to J anything. Those present agreed : unanimously to report this Tuesday morning with axes and muscles and go to work to build the house and I am satisfied they are going to do it. And soon they will have a comfort- ( j able school house. I E. H. A. , Attention W. O.
