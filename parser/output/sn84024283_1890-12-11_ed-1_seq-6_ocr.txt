DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. Annual Report or Attorney-General Mil ler Justice Declared to be OUstructeU lu Many Places, Officers and Witnesses Assassinated and the Murderers Pro tected Under State Courts The Work of the Year. Washington. Dec. 5. The annual report of Attorney-General Miller for the last fiscal year shows that the du ties of the Department of Justico have been extensive and varied. Tho en forcement of the laws and the difficul ties therein encountered are set forth. Tho report says: In some parts of the country the lawless ness to which attention was called in the last annual report of this department con tinues. The enforcement of the Internal Kevenue laws and of the United States Elec tion laws is particularly resisted, and offi cers of the internal revenue, as well as United States marshals are freijuently met with vio lence, and are occasionally the victims of as sassination at the hands of those guilty of violation of these and other laws, ami their friends. Several assassinations of officers and witnesses, with the purpose of imped ing the execution of laws and orders of tho United States courts have occurred during the past year. Within the last ten days, a deputy marshal, attempting to serve a war rant for the arrest of a man for violation of the postal laws, was shot and instantly killed by the man sought to be arrested; and, at a preliminarv examination before a magistrate of the State, the prisoner was promptly dis charged. It is certainly an anomaly in government, that those who have committed murders for the purpose of stopping prosecutions in the Federal courts should not only not be pun ished, but not even he put upon trial, although in at least two cases in one district during is:), well known. Yet such is the fact. It is needless to say that the Federal courts have no adequate jurisdiction of these of fenses. Section 5509 of the Revised Statutes provides that if any person attempts by in timidation, threats, etc., to prevent any citi zen from exercising the right of suffrage, and in so doing commits a felony, or if two or more persons conspire to debar any per son from the enjoyment of any of his civil rights and in so doing commit a felony, such felony shall be punished according to the laws of the State wherein the same is com mitted. If Section 6509 were so broadened as to make any felony, committed while in the act o" violating any statute of the United States, triab.'e in the United States courts, and pun ishable according to the laws of the State wherein the same is committed, it would greatly help in the administration of justice. So long as persons who kill officers, wit nesses or jurors, for the purpose of imped ing the administration of justice, can only be tried and punished in a Federal Court as for a minor offense, the administration of the United States laws and the laws themselves in many districts will have little respect. The Supreme Court has recently decided that there is a "peace of the United States." Is it not the duty of Congress to provide by law for the preservation of this "peace" everywhere and at all times. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the sit uation, the officers of this department have been diligent in executing the laws. In prosccut ions for violations of the Election laws, in several districts, convictions and pleas of guilty have been obtained in a large number f cases. As illustrating one of the difficulties met in such prosircutions, the dis trict attorney for one district reports that, in it certain county, u number of whose citizens were convicted of violations of the Election laws, the county court ordered all lines and costs assessed against them in the United States Court to be paid out of the county treasury; and that in another county, a num ber of whose citizens were in like manner convicted or had pleaded guilty to indict ments for such offenses in the United States court, fl,30u was actually paid out of the county treasury upon such lines and costs in one day. Thee facts Bpeak for themselves. The crowded condition of the Supreme Court docket is brought to public attention. The docket of the court, at the close of tho last term, as compared with the condition at the close of the term next preceding shows an increase of thirty-tw caueu undinpoed of, appellate and original. Five thousand, fivt hundred and Bixty-nine petitions, represent ing 2.S09 vessels, and claims of about $42,000. 000, have been filed in the Court of Claim under the French Spoliation act, and during thepuftt year twenty-four cases have been decided favorably for the claimants, involv ing an allowance of S102.K03. During the past fiscal year l,7fi8 civil suits, to which the United States was party ter minated. There were terminated during tho year 16,126 criminal prosecutions, 187 under the Customs laws; 6,720, under the Internal licTenue laws ; 683 under Post-office laws ; 30 under Election laws; 3 under the Civil Kigh'-s act ;(31 under the Intercourse act; 246 under the Pension laws; 55 for embezzlement; 2 under the Inter-State Commerce laws; under the Naturalization laws, and 6,891 ml cellaneous prosecutions. The aggregate of fines, forfeitures and po alties imposed during the year in crimlnu.1 prosecutions was f5Il,K64, and the amount of these fines, forfeitures and penalties coV lected during the year was $s7,C2tt. A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. Awful Loss af Lite Vador Falling WhIu Th Dead, Iajareal and Missing'. Joi.iet, 111., Dec. 4.

The State of Finance and Trade Through out the Country as Indicated by It- G. Hun & Co's Weekly Keview The .Money Stringency Continues, Hut tfo. Causes lor It Oraduly 1. using Away Trade Gen erally Itrislc and Labor Troubles Few Business Failures. A.tc New York, Dec 6. IL G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade says: Stringency in commercial loans, noticed last week as the chief cause of the present disturbance, is now almost the oulv remain ing cause. The influence of kuropean troubles has passed. Foreign commerce is heavily in favor of this country. In do mestic affairs there has been a distinct im provement in the disposition of banks and money lenders to give necessary support to legitimate business, curtailing speculative advances as far as possible. This wiser disposition is shown not only, in much larger issues of clearing-house certifi cates and larger loans here, hut in dispatches from many other places. Very numerous and full reports from other cities this M eek show that the cheapness of cotton at the South and delay of winter weather at the North, have somewhat reduced transac tions, and caused more tardiness in collec tions than heretofore; but colder weather and the approach of the holiday season already begin to have a favorable effect ai many points. Thus, at St. I.ouis, trade is im proved in all seasonable lines; excelcnt at l'.altimore and better at Detroit and Boston. At most Southern points the slower move ment of cotton on account of low prices is named as the principal cause of delay in collections. There is greater ease at Cincin nati and one or two other points, and at Chicago necessary advances for legitmate business are made to the exclusion of long-drawn or speculative demands. The country trade is healthy, and no fears for the future are expressed. At Boston there is a better feeling, colder weather giving more life to the woolen trade and sales of wol reaching 2,128,000 pounds. Providence notes quiet trade, print cloths weak and money tight. Philadelphia reports some activity in holiday trade, though retail dry goods busi ness is below expectations and the grocery trade is only fair. Wool is extremely dull. In general, the volume of trade throughout the country is so heavy that, with the ad vance or 7V2 per cent, in prices since a year ago, larger supplies of money are absorbed. The amount of currencv in circulation is now over $1,604,000,000, being $S7 ,000,000 larger than a year ago. There is no -especial change noted in the great industries! though pig Iron is weaker in tone. Demands for flu ished products of iron and steel are still large, though distinctly less than a month ago, and rails are weak with scanty sales. The woolen manufacture is much more hope ful and confident than it was six months or a year ago, but manufacturers are moving with caution. Labor troubles are very few, and the industry of the country is remarka bly well employed at fair wages. The failures during the last seven days number, for the United States 2S2 and for Canada 30, or a total of 312, as compared with a total of 249 last week. For the correspond ing week of last year the figures were 316, representing 271 in the United States and 45 in Canada. A BIG

VERGING ON A CRISIS. The Dominion Declared to be on the Verge itf a Commercial Crisis The Ex port and Import Trade Show an lui mvuse Fulling: OCT. Ottawa, Ont, Dec. 6. The Official Gazette of the Government to-day shows that there is a deficit of nearly Sl.000,000 in the treasury for five months ending December 1. Importa tions are steadily fallimgoiT and the rev enue from customs duties shows a shrinkage of over $500,000 for November as compared with the corresponding month of last year. A leading politi cian said last night that however much be regretted to make the admission, Canada, be believed, was on the verge of a commercial crisis. The export trade efcowa aa enormous shrinkage, more e-pecially to the United States, which last year took forty-five per cent of all Canada had to sell. The Govern ment is exerting every means to secure new market bui with little ehcourag ment to snipper as yet. 'VThat, Nwver?" L'oxnox, Dec. 6. The overbearing tone of the President of the United States in regard to the Dehring Sea question has aroused much surprise in official circles here, it having been be lieved that the United States would not insist upon its claim to exclusive juris diction. The Foreign Office is reticent, but semi-official intimations are given currency to the effect that England will n-'ver consent to recognize American control of the waters in question beyond the usual limit, and that tho Hntisb will be prepared next season to defend British vessels against seizure.

APOSTLE OF BOODLE Hanison'a Epistle to Congress - Proves Him to Be Such. Xariff Robbery, Steamship Subsidies, Rec iprocity Humbug and Federal Con trol ot Elections Upheld by the President. Monopoly Upheld Otnd:lly, Chicago Herald. 1 All those enlightened Republicans who have hoped against hope that a way out of tho monopoly camp would be found for their party and that Presi dent Harrison might prove to be their Moses will find no comfort in the Ex ecutive message. It not only indorses and adheres to McKinleyism, but it favors steamship subsidies, calls for the passage of the bayonet election bill, and even ventures to say of the present cor rupt and shameless Congress, already repudiated as no other Congress ever was, that "its work may be confidently submitted to the considerate judgment of the people." If progressive Repub licans can find in such a manifestation of IJourbonism a single ray of comfort the Herald wishes them much joy. The message is an intensely partisan production, bearing evidence of hasty preparation and of the use of such ex cuses and subterfuges as came first to hand in a disorderly scramble after something to say. To all intents and purposes it is a confession that the Mc Kinley bill is all that the opponents of that measure have represented it to bo, for the people are now told that that infamous law was not expected to prove beneficial . immediately. They must wait a year or two until the riotous rob bers of the trusts fall out over the spoil, or until the sagacity of men de vises new schetnes of competition by which its outrages may be evaded. In thus committing his party to the con tinued defense of a law designed to op press the many and to enrich the few the President will strengthen himself with the mill-owning fraternity which contributes campaign fat and makes and unmakes Presidential candidates. To this extent ho is at least honest in his dishonesty, and his occasional ref erence to the subject of wages as though a fallacy so thoroughly ex ploded as that could be made to do duty any further shows that he is as callous to the scorn of intelligent men as he is unmindful of the hardships of the oppressed. In a word, then, the Republican poli cy, as outlined by the President who hopes to succeed himself, comprehends these three points: 1. Unlimited mon opoly tariff taxes. 2. Unlimited power by the Davenports, Quays and Dudleys over the people's elections. 3. Unlim ited subsidies for steamships. Hope lessly infatuated as such a course must appear to all who are not under the spell of monopoly, it should be borne in mind that Mr. Harrison lives in an at mosphere of privilege, injustice, cant and selfishness. The great leaders of his party are monopolists or attorneys of monopolists. Not one among them stands for any thing else. They fatten on the people. They have profited so long by unwise and unjust, laws, and the successful oppression of others has seemed so respectable to them and to others, that they naturally exert a pow erful influence upon a weak and vain man, who owes to them all that he is and all that he hopes to be. They have paid for the McKinley bill in cash con tributions. They will never give it up until a triumphant Democracy ruth lessly sweeps away frodi them the pow er to corner markets and to choose Presidents. Dubious as tho last ditch attitude of their leaders must appear to honorable Republicans, Democrats will accept tho situation cheerfully and proceed to ar range their forces for the final struggle in 1892. The McKinley bill will be a robber bill in that year the same as it is to-day. Time may obliterate some of its baldest oppressions, but it can not temper the wrath of the millions whom it has plundered. A Collection of Platitudes. f IChicago News. In the collection of weak platitudes which constitute President Harrison's annual message to Congress tno Chief Executive has succeeded in disappoint ing that portion of tho Republican party which is not wedded to discredited idols. It v.ras hoped by many moderate and progressive Republicans that President Harrison would at least take somo cognizance of the recent popular rebel lion against high taxation. It was even hoped by some that the President might rise to the occasion with a manifestation of real statesmanship by severing the relations of his party with its discred ited Bourbon leaders. How has the President met theso ex pectations? By a sorry display of tenacity to the very principles which the American people, including hundreds of thousands of progressive Republicans, have pro nounced against in thunder tones. The President's shuffling apology for the McKinley law is tho weakest point in a remarkably weak public document. His adherence to Mr. Blaine's reciprocity policy, as embodied in the eleventh hour amendment to the McKinley law, settles once for all the rumors of a split between the President and Mr. Blaine. It is now more clear than ever that Secretary Blaine's policy of reciprocity, however reluctantly adopted, is relied upon by the Bourbon Republicans to lessen the nauseousness of the McKin ley law in actual operation. .The Presi dent writes of the reciprocity question with the unfamiliarity of a tyro, but he has at least made it clear that James G. Blaine will hereafter hold tho Re publican policy on tariff matters in the hollow of his hand. President Harrison reserves the dis credited and utterly obnoxious Federal elections bill for the clfmax of his mes sage. In his adherence to the policy which materially helped to create the recent political Waterloo for the Re publicans Mr. Harrison again demon strates the quality which marks Bour bonisni the world over namely: "never to learn and never to forget" In this portion of his message President Har rison has widened the gulf between moderate rational Republicanism and that portion of his party which still be lieves that the "bloody shirt" will never fail as a talisman of power. Mr. Harrison's utterances on other National topics are characterized by conservatism and trite moralizing. He handles several minor topics with wis dom and moderation, but the effect of the entire document will be almost de stroyed by its tame subservience to nar row and discredited political motives. In short, it is a spiritless and perfunc tory statement of the opinions of Bour bon Republicans. It is a synopsis not of personal convictions but 01 partisan precepts of principles formulated by others but accepted and probably now believed in by himself. Small Effort of a 8mU Man. Chicago Times.! But why do we characterize Benjamin Harrison as a Bourbon? Because of his declarations regarding tho election law. which the Senate did not pass, and because notwithstanding the verdict of his countrymen expressed with unmis takable emphasis, he stands by the discredited McKinley bill, which he signed, as his message shows, without full comprehension of its import. He states that its terms conflict with a rec iprocity treaty existing between the United States and the petty kingdom or Hawaii, and be asks that it bo cured in this particular, but in no other. He de fends the force bill and urges its pass age. It is a bill which would revive in the South the bayonet rule and the scandalous carpet-bag days, and is therefore a generation behind the time. There is no likelihood that, notwith standing the President's advocacy, tho Senato will pass a measure so abhorrent to the popular sense of liberty and jus tice. Tho McKinley tariff bill, which the President approved and which he con tinues to advocate, hud a well-defined purpose regarding nine-tenths ol tho schedules. It was drawn in tho spirit of tho tariff resolution passed by the convention which nominated Harrison. Its motive was to discourage importa taion of such articles as are made- at home, yet we find the Prosident declar ing that "already we begin to he ir from abroad and from our custom houses that the prohibitory effects upon our impor tations imputed to tho act are not justi fied." Then it is not efficient. Wherefore the President rejoices and demands a fair trial for it. The in creasing price of commodities, which tells the real story, the President attrib utes to silver legislation, which ho ap proved. Altogether he is in a melan choly muddle about the matter, and knows nothing more than this, that ho stands for a high protective tariff, which the people have condemned, and hopes when his own day of trial comes tho people may judge it moro leniently. Tho President is not willing to leave to his Secretary of State any credit for ad vocacy of reciprocity, but he goes far ther than the Secretary in suggesting that reciprocity mean something. We are to confine free trade to people with whom we have precious little trading that is, we are to have a shadow, not a substance. The message is important only in so far as it indicates that there will bo no repeal, and no modification except for the correction of errors, as in the Hawaii an matter, of the McKinley law, and that on tho great economic questions of the tariff the Republican position, de clared at Chicago, will not bo substan tially changed, notwithstanding popular" disapproval. The Republican is a high tariff party. The reciprocity suggestion is a mere anchor to windward thrown out for what it is worth that is, for next to nothing. The message has 'this further inter est. It is the last but two that Benja min Harrison, undoubtedly the smallest man who ever occupied the Presidency, will formulate. Benny la To Old to Le irn. Chicago Post. There is nothing in President Harri son's message to indicate that its author has been impressed with the lesson of last month's elections. Those phenom enal expressions of public opinion con veyed .to all tho world tho people's unequivocal disapproval of the work of the controlling party in the Fifty-first Congress. Whoever. in that party had taken conspicuous part in the business ' of the session was selected for special rebuke. The single exception was Mr. Reed, and he was re-elected before the tariff bill had gone into effect McKin ley was defeated, and Lodge, though ho escaped that fate, was returned by a majority so greatly decreased as to amount to a moral defeat A majority of the House that favored the theories of McKinley and Lodge received tho special intimation of their constituents that these theories were hateful to the American sense of right. Thus spoke the American people, almost without regard for party, on No vember 4. They spoke in vain to Pres ident Harrison. Within a month from that day he addresses Congress with what amounts to a special plea in defense of the very measures repudiated by the people at the polls. Less than thirty das ago the voters declared in thunderous tones their repudiation of the McKinley tariff bill and of tho Lodge election bill; Mr. Harrison's retort to this is a mes sage to Congress impugning the popular verdict and urging Congress to continue in the lines of those very measures. t The American people have declared their will in unmistakable tones, and President Harrison has told the Amer ican people that they don't know what they want. It is difficult to conceive what mo tives could have prompted the ut terance of such a mewasre at such a time. President Harrison has of fered to his fellow partisans in tho Fifty-first Congress the choice between his own expressed will and tho ox pressed will of the people. He can hardly expec4; that he will bo preferred in such an alternative, or if ho should be, that the outcome would be profita ble to his own or his colleagues' politic al hopes. Tho message has tho sole merit of consistency; but it is the con sistency of a defeated man who can not or will not acknowledge his defeat. The Force ISdl His IV t Theme. Detroit Free fress. The President stands by his guns in respect to the tariff and force bills, and is careful to put his advocacy of them in the rear of his message, so as to se cure reading for the remainder. Had he started off with these topics, tho rest would have received scant attention from the public Tho most noticeable thing about his treatment of tho tariil matter is that he has evidently learned nothing by experience. His economic argument is the same dre;iry twiddle he used to indulge in when he was n.ak ing his campaign and talking about the superiority of markets to maxims. He stil entertains tho long exploded notion that a nation only profits by what il sells and that every thing received in exchange for what it exports is a dead loss to it. It is a bad symptom that in this era of civil service reform the censut of the United States should for the firsl time in the history of the country be questioned. There is discouraging evi dence in it that it was the partisan action of a President pledged lo disre gard partisanship in auch matters thai has wrought this serious injury. Bos ton Herald.
