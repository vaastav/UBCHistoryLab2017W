Edinburgh, Dec. 10.—The court of ses sions today dismissed the action brought by the Spanish minister of marine against the Clyde Banking company for £75,000 damages owing to delay in the delivery of four torpedo boat destroyers, which it was claimed, were required for the Spanish-American war but were not delivered within the contract time. The sessions court held that as the contract was made with a state which was a monarchy, the monarch alone could enforce a claim.

FATE IS WITH JURY The fate of Patrick Hayes, whose trial for ehe murder of William J. McCaine has been in progress in Judge McCler nan's court for two or three days, is now with the jury. The case went to the jury at 12 o'clock and at a late hour this afternoon no ver dict had been reached. The evidence was concluded last even ing and the arguments ended at noon to day. Then the case went to the jury, and the matter of whether Hayes should be hanged, imprisoned or freed lay with them for a decision. The courtroom was packed when the arguments were delivered this morning, and a crowd loitered in the room all afternoon awaiting the verdict. The failure of the jury to reach a prompt conclusion had been predicted, and so the event was no surprise. _. , , ,___ . insn^edThe jury and we^e present at a disagreement or a verdict'ot murd'er the second de 8 re, tv., prOhah,,, I A nn ATflll I inn B B S I 0 N b I B E L HOW THE M.

But about an hour or two j after 'the fire had been going it was dis covered that the interference with the supply was at the Butte & Boston smelter, controlled by the Amalgamated people, who also controlled the water works. Of course nobody alleges any thing. It was just a coincidence. But Heinze prefers now his own water sup ply, his own bank, and, to tell the truth, his own postoffice, for scandal of scan dals, Mr. Heinze has now no confidence in the United States mail. lowing statement Superintendent Gillie being in Anacon- ; da today, the above extract was sub- i mitted to Eugene Carroll, superintendent of the water company, who made the fol The Montana Ore Purchasing company put in its own water pipe system, using four-inch mains.

The Montana Ore Purchasing company turned on eight streams, having a pressure of from 65 to 75 pounds, as the records of its own meter will prove. The entire Boston & Montana fire brigade rushed to the assist anee of the Montana Ore Purchasing t company and turned on two more ! streams.

That is all I' care to say on the subject. The people of Butte and the firemen and miners of both companies know the facts. A member of the Butte & Boston fire brigade was asked this afternoon If the members of his company did all they could. Of course we did. We worked like beavers.

"—FINANCIAL MATTERS HENRY CLEWS' OPINIONS AND COMMENT ON THE MARKET. ATTEMPT TO RAISE VALUES President Roosevelt's Message De clared Dictated by ilound Judg ment and Thorough Under standing. hearty (By Associated Press.) New York, Dec. 10.—According to Henry Clews the Wall street situation is practically unchanged. Du the one side we see stocks powerfully concentrated in few hands and an attempt made ,o ru : values to u still higher level by means of various deals, by encouraging easy money and by other artifices best known to skililul manipulators. Con tinued prosperi y and large railroad earnings ha c afforded a strong basis for such a mo\eoicat, and at the moment there are no signs of pronounced weak ness, except lit' unsatisfactory devel opments in Anurig. «mated Copper, which have undoubtedly impeded the efforts for a renewed ull campaiign. The large interests are unqu slionably committed to tlie long side of the market; they have stocks i are slow to bi certainty of t fered. Trust Evils Self-Corrective. Many of the trust evils would be self corrective under reasonable publicity. The president apparently left the cur rency question to hi-- able secretary, Mr. Gage, who treats this important problem with unusual fun n and clearness in his annual report. There is no domestic question of greaitr importance for con gress to wrestle with than this one. The country n oils a -ch ntiiic and auto r matic currency system in keeping with modern progress. The change can best 'be made under prosperous condition. When reaction sets in and credit con tracts, prejudice and ignorance will be more difficult to overcome than now. Mr. Gage's remarks on the currency should be thouglufu!;y read by every well-wisher of hi country. Labor and Capital The president s in. ; age 11 which the public | nless tuey s,-e more j than has been uf is a pro nouncement upon (.lie grout affairs of the day' which will meet ui.ii instant and approval, buih at home and abroad. Us enil.u nt cousei vutism must dispel any apprehension of radical rec ommendations that may perhaps have existed among a few. Tue president's attitude towards the vast business inter est of the country is an earnest of sound judgment and thorough understanding. The interests of labor air! capital have alike and equally been considered. The policy of publicity in nga.fi to the af lairs of so-caiicd tiusts is a very salu 'ary recommandation which must carry with it tlie opinion of all fair-minded men. Message Universally Approved. Those who anticipated a "strenuous" message from President Roosevelt were disappointed. Tlie president's first mes sa g ( . was a calm and conservative docu rnen t, entirely free of radical or dema gogical features. While his treatment of disputed questions could not be expected p i ea se everybody, all agreed that his recommendations were strictly within limits of safety. The financial com munity was chiefly Interested in his ut terances regarding trusts. These he treated in a frank, judicial and temperate eplrit! and his ideas upon publicity, need less to say, met with universal approval, If such legislation as he suggests were now in force Wall street would be free today from one of its worst uncertainties, and Amalgamated Copper would not be the scapegoat of the market.
