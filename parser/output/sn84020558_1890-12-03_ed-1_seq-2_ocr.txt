PRESIDENTS MESSAGE Tho message of President Harrison which was printed in full In yesterdays Republican will stand as an exceed ingly nblo stato paper It ia not radical in tho advocacy of any measures favored yet it deals with them in a very strong and able manner Tho varioua Execu tive Departments of tho Government are not dealt with in detail but a concise and clear statement of their magnitude given nnd then Congress is referred to tho reports of tho various Secretaries Referring to tho values of farm pro ducts and tho operations of the tariff the President snows that same versatile knowledge of tho subject which he showed in his numerous speeches in 1883 and which so agreeably surprised his friends As he well says there lias been a marked increase in tho price of farm products tho past year and every attontion possiblo is being devoted by tho administration to tho farming in terests His position in favor of protec tion to American intercsta and American industries is in lino with that policy which stands for tho greatest good to the greatest number Ho clearly shows tho absurdities of tho domogoguic cries of increased prices caused by tho tariff when in fact there was a general upward tendency of tho market from other sources and articles not at all affected by tho tariff shared in the ad vance tmports at Now York for the first three weeks of November being tho first under tho McKinloy bill in creased 8 per cent over 1889 and 7 per cent over 1888 for the corresponding porloda in thoso years Tho cries against the tariff camo largely from abroad and nro re echoed at home by a claas who would rcduco laboring men to tho lowest possiblo margin England Franco Austria and Germany may well cry out againat Americas tariff when that tariff enables homo manu factories to spring up which will furnish tho articles heretofore imported from thoso countries Tho reciprocity clauso of tho tariff bill is especially commended and thero is now no question of reciprocity being one of tho principles on which tho Re publican party will conduct ita cam paign in 1892 With steamship lines to tho countries south of us which tho President so earnestly recommends thoro will bo doveloped a trade that will turn millions of dollars to tho balance in favor of tho United States Congress can scarcely fail to appropriate sums for tlio encouragomont of this ocean carrying trade Upon tho Mormon evil tho Prcsidont Bhows great familiarity nnd that ho has investigated tho subject thoroughly Tho reports of the Governors of Idaho Wyoming Utah and Arizona submitted to tho Secrotary of tho Interior con tained much valuablo Information from men thoroughly conversant with tho subject Secretary Noble also laid con siderable stress upon this terrible blot onlho Nation and tho President shows that he too considered well tho hypoc risy and treason of this organization His remarks should bo carefully read by ovory voter Ho says The Increasing number and Influence ol the non Mormon population In Utah Is observed with satisfaction The recent letter of Wllford Woodruff president of tho Mormon Church In Which ho advised his people to rofroln from THE 

ARIZONA REPUBLICAN PHCENTX WEDNESDAY MORNING DECEMBER 3 1890 contracting any marriage forblddijn by the laws of the land has attracted much attention and It Is hoped that Its Influence will to highly bene ficial In restraining Infractions of the law of the United States but tho fact should not bo overlooked that tho doctrine or belief of Jtlie Church that polygamous mar riages are rightful and supported by Dlvlno rev elation remains unchanged President Woo ruffdoes not renounce tho doctrlnobut refrains from teaching It and advises against tho prac tice of It ticcuuso tho law Is now against It It li quite true the law should not attempt to deal with the faith or belief of any one but this Is quite another thing and the only easy way to deal with the Territory of Utah Is that those who believe polygamy to bo rlgutM shall not have tho power to make It lawful His advocacy of a National olectijin law is tho clearest and most forcible argument in favor of such a law wehavo over seen presented It is so pertinent to tho question in every phase of it that it is here quoted in full If an Intelligent and loyal company of Amer ican citizens wore required to catalogue tho es sential human conditions of national life I do not doubt that with absolute unanimity they would begin with free and hoaest election and it Is gratifying to know that in general thero Is a growing and non partisan demand for better election laws But against this sign I hopo and progress must be set the depressing and undeniable fact that election laws tnd uwthods are sometimes cunningly contrived to ensure minority control A whole volume would be needed to complete the list of shortcomings and fraud In my last annual message I sug gested that the adaptment of the existing law providing for federal supervising of Con gresslonal elections offer od an effective method of reforming theso abuses Tim need of such a law has manifested Itself in many parts of the country and ita wholesome restraints and pen alties will be useful in all The constitutional ity of such legislation has been affirmed by the Supreme Court Its probablo eflectlvcnets Is evidenced by the character ol tho opposition that Is made to it It has been denounced as It It were a new exercise of federil power and un Invasion of the rights of tho itate Nothing could be further from tho truth Congress has already fixed a ttmo for the election of members of Cougress which must be by written or printed ballots It has provided for the appointment by Circuit Courts upon the petition of a cer tain number of citizens of election super visors and made It their duty to supervise tho registration of voters conducted by tho a- to ofllcers to challenge persons ofTerlng to resis tor to personally Inspect and scrutinize the registry lists and to affix their names to the lists tor the purpose of Identification and preven tion of frauds to attend at elections and re main with tho boxes until tho votes are all cast and counted to attach to the registry list and election returns any statement touching the ac curacy and fairness of the registry and election to take and to transmit to tho clerk of the House of Representatives any evidence of fraudulent practices which may bo presented to them The same law provides for the appoint meut of deputy United States marshals to attend tho polls and support the supervisors in the dis charge of their duties and to arrest persons vio lating the election law The provisions of this familiar title of tho Revised Statutes hive been put Into exercise by both the gteat political parties In tho North as well as iu the South It is not therefore a ques tion whether wo shall have a federal election law for wo now have one and have had one for nearly twenty years but whether we shall have an effsctlve one The present law stops Just nhort of effective ness for It surrenders to the local authorities all control over tho certification which estab lishes the right to a seat In tho House of Repre sentatives This defect should be cured Equal ity of representation and the purity ol elections must be maintained or everything that Is valua ble in our system of government will be lost The qualification of an elector must be sought In the law not in the opinion prejudice or fears of a class however powerful The pith ol an elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush fear and the enticement of fraud the courso true and open that none shall gainsay it Such a law should be absolutely non partisan and impartial It should glvd the advantage to honesty the control to majority Surely there is nothing sectional about this creed If itsball happen that the penalties of the laws intended to enforce these rights fall hure and not there It Is not because the law is sectional but be cause happily crime li local and not universal Nor should it be forgotten that every law whether relating to electlonn or to any otter subject whether enacted by the Stato or by the Nation has force behind It The court the tiar thai or constable the po comltatus tho prison are all and always behind the law One cannot be Justly charged with unfriendliness to any section or class who seeks only to restmln violators of law and of personal right No com munity will find lawlessness r roll table no com munity can afford to have it known that the officers who are charged with the preservation of the public peace unci tho restraint of their criminal classes arc themselves the product of fraud or violence The magistrate is then w ith out respect and tho law wltho at sanction The lawlessness can be made to run In one channel Tho killing of a United States Marshal carry ing a writ of arrest for an election oPenso Is full of offense to the men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crlma against life or property But It is said that this leglslttion will revive animosities and some bavo even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made impossible they may be supplanted by Intimi dation and violence If the proposed law gives anyquallfledelectorbyahalrs width morethan his equal influence or detracts so much from any other qualified elector It is fatally im peached But if tho law is equal and the animosity to evoke grow out of tho fact that some electors have been accuiitomed to exercise the franchise for others as well as for them selves then theso animosities ought hot bo con fessed without shame and cannot be given any weight In the discussion without dishonor No choice Is left to mo but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secure to tho citizen his con stitutional rights and to recommend that the Inadequacies of such laws be promptly remedied If to promote with zeal every project for the development of its material Interests rivers harbors mines and factories and the Intelli gence peace and security under the law of its communities and its homes Is not accepted as sufficient evidence of friendliness to any state or section I cannot add connlvanco at election practices that not only disturb not only all local results but rob the electors of other states and sections of their most priceless political ngnts As a whole tho messago is a very strong one one which cannot well bo nttacked and one which the people will read with interest and will fullvendoise J O
