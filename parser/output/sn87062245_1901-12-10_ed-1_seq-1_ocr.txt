5 5 - PHILIPPINE TARIFF BILL Ways and Means Commit tee Agreement SALIENT FEATURES OF MEASURE No Voto Taken But All Day Hear ing Practically Docidos Terms of Bill May Bo Roportod Today No Important Ohangos Llkoly To Impose the rates ot the Dingier bill schedule upon goods imported into tho United States from the Philippines to collect duties at the rates fixed by the Philippine Commission upon articles im ported Into the Islands from this coun try to rebate the Internal revenue tax upon goods Imported into the Philippines which pay an Internal revenue tax in this country these are the three simple but Important points Included In the Philip pine tariff bill which the Ways and Means Committee Is preparng to submit to the House of Representatives Notwithstanding all the discussion and tnrllf talks these are the three material propositions which will be embodied in the hill A meeting of the Republican members of the committee was held yes terday It lasted practically all day and the committee heard Secretary Rout and Colonel Edwards In charge of the IrroMr division of the War Department for troro than two hours yesterday aftcrnooi No Inportnnt llodlfleati w While no vote was taken befcr ad journment the understanding wi hat the bill should contain the provisions men tioned There will be no modifications of any Importance in the rates of tc Ding ley tariff or the commissions tariff save that to obviate a double payment of rev enue by the manufacturers of spirits beer and tobacco This understanding however was not arrived at without considerable opposi tion and for a time a division of the Re publican members ot the committee was threatened Representative Russell fa vored and strongly urged what was prac tically a horizontal lowering ot the Ding ley rates IS or 20 per cent upon goods Imported from the Philippines and a similar reduction in the rates of the commissions tariff One or two other members looked with more or less favor upon this proposition Reciprocity Plan Short Lived There was also another proposition along the same line to enact the Dlnxley tariff and the commissions tariff but to make certain modifications In the na ture of reciprocity agreements whereby It was thought to promote the trade re lations between this country and Its In sular possessions In the Orient Tho United States now conducts but a very small percentage of tho commerce with the Islands tbc great bulk going to Spain Great Britain and Germany The proposition did not live long how ever after Secretary Root bad begun his statement before the committee There was much discussion during the morning and nn adjournment was taken to have the Secretary of War appear before the committee With Colonel Edwards Mr Root went Into a detailed explanation ot the manner In which the schedules had been determined ot the hearings that had been given and generally reviewed the entire subject Mr Hoot Ilefore Committee Mr Root explained that the matter ot differential rates had been taken Into con sideration and that as a matter of fact coneessions had been made on goods Im ported into the Islands from the United States This was done not by stipulating explicitly that goods manufactured In the United States should be admitted at low er rates than those of any other country but the rates were made lower upon the classes and kinds ot goods shipped from this country Tliero aic two propositions beforo tho committee in regard to the relief of those who pay an internal revenue duty One Is that goods which are subject to the col lection of an Internal revenue In this country shall not bo compelled to make that payment here If they arc shipped In bond to the Philippines and pay the tarn duties there The other is that the pay ment of Internal revenue Bhall be made hero and that the amount shall be re bated on payment of duty upon entering the Philippines It Is probable that the latter proposition will be adopted Ihfttie nt riist in Dotilit The absence of Representatives Steele and Hopkins gave rise to some uneasi ness yesterday as It left the committee politically nine to six with at least two of tho members doubtful as to the stand they should take Representative Mct calf of California tho new member of the roiniuKtec was anxious that all possible be done to stimulate the Oriental trade or the Pacific Coast and was doubtful if this would be effected by the proposed bill The bill was not entirely satisfactory to two other members so there was a possi bility that from one to three or the Re publicans might oppose the views or the majority ir two did so with Represent atives Hopkins and Steele away It would Lave blocked the progress or the bill It Is thought however that aB the re sult ot Secretary Roots statements all op position will be withdrawn by the Repub lican members and that the programme for presenting the bill to the House will be carried out Threatened lllvlslon Averted What promised to create a division of tbo Republicans on the subject ofStartj tor the Philippines is thus avertcdjfjp rat as the commlltco is concerned although It Is not improbable that numerous amendments will be offered when tho bill reaches the House The Democrats will hold a conference today mid decide upon their plan ol action In regard to the bill It Is not probable that they will make any strenuous opposition to tne Republi can programme The only question now with the Democrats Is the leaslblllty or the tariff There will bo a meeting of tho full com mittee today and It is probable that the bill may be reported to the House today or tomorrow as the administration lead ers desire to have the tariff enacted as soon as possible The commissions tariff was adopted last September but was only put Into effect on November 15 and has thus been In operation less than four weeks At the meeting of the full committee torta Chairman Pvyne will name a sub committee to which will be referred such portions of the Presidents message as in ly come within their purview The Itepubllcnn memberi ot the Ways and Means Commltteo will meet In further conferenco this morning nt 10 oclock They decided last evening that the measure as agreed upon should be temporary but as to other details there Is still some diversity of opinion It Is believed however that it will be reported to the House and passed this week A regular meeting of the Ways and Means Committee will also be held this morning when the committee will be formally organized and that part of the Presidents message relating to the tariff subject will be distributed among the sub committees
