War against Austria was formally declared at 6:03 o'clock yesterday aft ernoon, when President Wilson signed the Joint resolution which, had been put through both houses of Congress earlier in the afternoon with but a sin gle vote cast against it. The vote against the resolution was cast by Representative Meyer London of New York, socialist. 1a Follette Explains Absence. Senator La Follette of "Wisconsin, one of those who voted against war with Germany, was absent from the Senate chamber at the time the vote was taken in that body. He announced on the floor of the Senate later that he had gone to his room to draft an amendment providing that the United States should not observe any agree ment of the entente allies to deprive Austria of the possession or control of any territory which she held August 1, 11*14. He said that he did not hear the summons to vote. If his amendment had been adopted. Senator La Follette said, he would have voted for the resolution. Without it he would have voted against the res olution. His amendment would without doubt have been defeated, members of the Senate said today. The vote in the House, which was taken some two hours after the Senate had adopted the resolution by 74 to 0, was 361 in favor of the resolution and one against it. Miss Rankin of Montana voted for the resolution. She shed tears when the vote on the resolution declaring war with Germany was taken and de clared that while she desired to sup port her country she could not vote for war. Jn explanation of her vote for war with Austria, Miss Rankin said she still believed war "stupid.'' She supported the resolution because it , was merely a technicality in the prose- ! cution of war already declared. Signed by the President. As soon as the resolution was signed by the Speaker and Vice-President it was sent to the White House for the President's approval. He signed the resolution without ceremony as if he were signing any ordinary routine measure, and a moment later It was on its way to the State Department to rest among the other archives of the government. In accordance with the President's recommendation, action with regard to Turkey and Bulgaria. Germany's other allies, was left to the future. Text of Resolution. The text of the resolution declaring war on Austria is as follows: "Whereas the imperial and royal i Austro-Hungarian government has committed repeated acts of war against the government and the peo ple of the United States of America: Therefore be it "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress as sembled. That a state of war is here by declared to exist between the United States of America and the imperial and royal Austro-Hun garian government; and that thf President be, and lie is hereby, au thorized and directed to employ tho entire naval and military forces of the United States and the resources of the government to carry on war against the imperial and royal Aus tro-Hungariar. government: and to bring the conflict to a successful termination all the resources of the country are hereby pledged by the Congress of the United States." Senate and House Adjourn. After passing the war resolution yes terday both *he Senate and House ad journed until next week, the former un til Monday and the latter until Tues day, to give committees and leaders time to work on appropriation bills and other legislation. 

COLD WAVE VISITATION WITH SHORTAGE OF COAL Blanket of Snow Over Wide Terri tory in Central and South western States. KANSAS CITY, Mo., December 8.? The first general snowstorm .of the season has struck the central and southwestern states, blanketing Ne braska. Kansas. Missouri, northern Ar kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas pan | handle district. The panhandle country (got only a half-inch, but in southeast ern Kansas and northern Arkansas the fall ranged from S to 12 inches. The storm was accompanied by low temperatures, Concordia, Kan., report ing 4 degrees above zero. The cold wave was accompanied by complaints about fuel from many Kansas cities, some being without and others short of coal. The snow has interfered with street car and railroad traffic, and many trains ar<* running behind schedule. The weather observer here said the snowstorm and cold wave were moving eastward. COMFORTS FOR BELGIAN ARMY. Appeal Is Made for Garments or Money to Buy Them. The Belgian army has been reorgan ized and is "on the job," although the American public doesn't hear much about it these days, for it is a small army and is holding a small sector. But what its sector lacks in size it makes up for in cold and dampness, and although the Belgian boys have guns, ammunition and, to some extent, uni forms. they ha<"e not the woolen com forts that are as essential as any of these. Many of them spend their occasional leaves in London, where Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Norton of the Sunday School Times are doing splendid work for them, trying to provide woolen com forts. One of these soldiers last winter told Mrs. Norton how he had seen nine brave and able-bodied comrades freeze to death because they were too scantily uniformed. Any persons in the District who wish to assist may send either knitted gar ments or the money to buy them to | Mrs. Ellen Middleton Young. 1312 I Rhode Island avenue northwest, who I will in turn forward the gifts direct to j Mrs. Norton in London.

Arthur Quy Erapey, two au diences of National Geographic Society members yesterday got thriils compar able wltl* a personal inspection of front line trenches, at the New Masonic Tem ple auditorium. The chairi represented the trench. A gas mask, a bomb and a swagger stick were helpful proper ties. The audience stealthily made Its way out into "no man's land" with Empey and his nineteen pals; they lay prone with him when rocket lights flared up, they shuddered with him when one "Tommy" sneezed, and shivered when another cut a barbed wire with a re sounding twang, right in front of a German trench. Vivid Word Picture. All in all, the author of "Over the Top, ^ the "Billy Sunday of the western front' (the*basis of the comparison is rhetorical not religious), gave about the most vivid word picture yet heard in Washington of what goes on in the trenches. Empey believes the war begins at home. "Every American ought to constitute himself a secret service agent and re port to the nearest police station any word from any supposed American citizen which is aimed at our govern ment, at our allies, or at premature peace," he said. "Maybe some persons might be Ipcked up unjustly, but we ought to intern everybody under sus-1 picion and there will be plentv of time to say we are sorry?after the war is! over." The speaker aroused enthusiasm by his tribute to the English officer. "Never have 1 seen such coolness," he said, "and never have 1 known a British officer to allow any one else to precede him in a place of danger." Speaker's Humor Interjected. The young American's irrepressible humor leavened the harrowing descrip tions of trench experiences. He told how a Scotchman and an Irishman sim ulated shell shock. But he was the butt of most of his own jokes. There was the time when "Old Pepper," nick name for his commanding officer, sent arourtd a request for volunteers. "Empey. here's your chance, says I," he continued. "About eighty Tommies will ofTer to go. They don't want but twenty. Here I, with my live feet even, will look like a valley between | two mountain ranges of men. I could j lust hear 'Old Pepper' saying, 'Step out, Empey,' and, 'Men, 1 want you to look at this man. an American, who volun I teered to come over here and see this war through; now he offers to per form a most dangerous duty. Empey. my man, we all admire your courage, j But you are too small. Fall out. There may be a reward for you later." But Empey miscalculated. Only | twenty volunteered, lie among them I and from that raid only three returned . alive. That was where Empey had his I shoulder shattered by boche bullets, and the side of his face torn off bv shrapnel. That is why he is now in this country.

Representative Keating Offers Bill to Establish a Federal Employ ment Service. A bill to establish a government em ployment service has been introduced by Senator Robinson and referred to the labor committee. A board of three would be named in each state to co operate. Practically the same bill was introduced in the House by Represen tative Keating of Colorado. The bill extends and unifies all labor exchange activities of the government, placing them on an independent basis in the Department of Labor in charge of a director to be appointed by the President. It also provides an inducement for improved service by granting financial aid to state and city employment bu reaus co-operating with the national service. Comprehensive System Now Lacking The war work of the government. It is pointed out. Is being seriously ham Dered because a comprehensive system of labor distribution is lacking in this country. The service proposed in the bill is in accord with proposals for the efficient organization and conduct of labor placement on a nation-wide scale, but goes further toward meeting the situation by providing for unified con trol and uniformity of policy, specify ing clearly the functions of the ne.w service and giving direct financial in ducement to states and cities for fit ting into the government's plan. The measure, which has the indorse ment of the Association for Labor Legislation and the Association of Pub lic Employment Officials, has been pre pared in co-operation with the De partment of Labor and other #federal government bodies.

WEYGAND'S RECORD. Successor to Gen. Foch in War Coun cil Rapidly Advanced. PARIS, December 8.?The undisguised surprise which greeted the appoint ment of Gen. Weygand to replace Gen. Foch on the interallied supreme war council?his name, it was pointed out by L'lntransigeant, being then heard for the first time by civilians?has led I to the publication of a short semi | official biography. It says that Gen. I Maxime Weygand was born in Brus sels in 1867: lieutenant colonel of cav alry at the beginning of the war; chief of staff of a group of armies November, 1914; major general, 1916; lieutenant general November last.

Appropriations of $333,000,000 for mail service, including a new item of $1,200,000 for censoring foreign mails, was reported by the House post office committee yester day, breaking all regular speed records for presentation of supply bills. There was considerable interest in whether this report would provide for pneumatic tube service. It does not. The censorship of foreign mails is to be conducted under authority already given by Congress. The committee added to the usual ap propriation for transportation of foreign mails $2,000,000, making a total of $3, 200.000 for that purpose to maintain the facilities built up for service in connec tion with American expeditionary forces abroad. Abandonment of the pneumatic tube service maintained by certain city post offices has long been urged by Postmaster General Burleson and Representative Moon, chairman of the committee, and the question was the subject of much de bate at the last session of Congress. Mr. Moon said, in ? explanation of the absence of any appropriation for the next fiscal year, that the law authorizing the tube service expired a year ago and Con gress extended it until June 30, 1918, pending a report and recommendations from a special congressional committee. That committee has not yet reported. CAMP McCLELLAN TrF.AT.TTTV Private Leo Madigan Says He Has Gained 25 Pounds There. Camp McClellan at Anniston, Ala., is a great health resort, according to Private Leo Madigan, a member of Com pany B, 312th Field Artillery, who re cently visited friends in this city. It is his honest opinion that some of the physically unfit for military service could be put in good physical condi tion, in a few weeks if they were sent to Camp McClellan. "I've gained twenty-five pounds dur ing my stay there," he said to his | friends, and the great improvement in ! his appearance was evidence of the ! change that had come as a result of training, good food and regular hours for arising and retiring. Private Madigan is the youngest son of the late Frank P. Madigan, an older brother, Francis W. Madigan. being a mess sergeant at Camp Meade. When President Wilson called for volunteers the young man was among the first to respond. Enlisting sooa after he celebrated his twenty-first birthday, the young man chose the cavalry branch of the District militia in which to serve his country. "It is true I preferred the cavalry to the artillery," he wrote friends, "but I see no reason why a man actuated by patriotic motives in enlisting in the service should not be willing to serve in one branch of the service as well as in another." 

WA1ER-PQWER BILL TO BE URGED UPON CONGRESS Has Support of Preaident?Develop ment by Company in Utah Saved Million Tons of Coal. Effort to put through Congress a water-power development bill, which will be supported by President "Wilson, will be one of the outstanding fea tures of the legislative activities of this session.' This bill is now being drafted. The solicitors' offices of the War Depart ment. the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior are trying to prepare such a measure as will reconcile the differences of opin ion between those who are eager for water-power development and the con servationists. Emphasized in Presidents Message. The need for water-power develop ment was emphasized by President Wilson in his message this week to Congress. Secretary Lane has pointed out that two big things that must re ceive the early attention of Congress are water-power development and the opening up of withdrawn oil lands. Leaders in Congress are prepared to carry forward both of these measures and to make a hard fight, if necessary, for their passage, just as soon as the administration gives the word. Several bills have been introduced in the Senate for water-power develop ment on public lands and navigable streams. Bills relating to water-power development on public lands have twice been passed in the House. The diffi culty previously has been to get those urging water-power development and those urging conservation reconciled to any bill. What the passage of a water-power development bill would mean is brought out in forcible figures which have been collected by the Department of the Interior. They show.with par ticular emphasis at this time, when the shortage of transportation facilities is forcing the pooling of the railroads of the country under government opera tion, and when the shortage of coal has been so persistently felt. Million Tons of Coal Saved Utah. Among these statistics is found the fact that development of 500,000,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity have saved Utah 1,000.000 tons of coal this year. This is the big saving made through the work of one power com pany. The supporters of the water power bill hope that the following fig ures regarding this one company may impress Congress: Total kilowatt-hours of hydro-elec tric power generated by this one com pany in 1917, 500.000,000. Number of additional tons of coal that would be required to do the work oerformed by this amount of electric power, 1,000,000. Railroad cars necessary to haul this coal, 25,000. Coal saved each month, R3.333 tons. Coal saved each day, 2,740 tons.
