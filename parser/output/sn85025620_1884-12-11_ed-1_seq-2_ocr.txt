The Vermont legislature has refused to create a railroad commission with powers and duties similar to those of the admirably constituted Massachusetts board, and has blso rejected a bill tc prevent discrimination against "short hauls." The reported plague in Western Vir­ ginia and Eastern Kentucky, resemble! cholera and is called cholera by the people. It is propagated- like cholera, through drinking water polluted with its germs. It acts quickly and with most of the symptoms of cholera. That it is sporadic is true nevertheless it rages under conditions almost exactly like those which prevail in cholera seasons and districts, except that the scourged reigon is mountuuous and high above the sea level, and that the cause Which first led to the use of impure water was drouth. Emigrants are pouring into California at the rate of 1500 to 1800 a week. IVIost of them settle in the southern part of the State and engage in fruit and wine growing. Many of the emi­ grants are men of means, who go to the country in search of health and are led to devote themselves to congenial busi­ ness. The poorer classes go to the northern counties and engage in agri­ cultural pursuits, while about 30 pe» cent of the whole number push ttDhortli to Oregon and Washington Territory The population of California is now about 1,000,000. "The Secretary of the interior is very explicit upon one subject that is a prom­ inent topic of public discussion. As to education by national aid, the.Sedretar.y says: *1 am of the opinion that the school systems of •hts several States should not be tuterf rred with by such •aid, and that it is not wise for the gen­ eral government to attempt to build up a school system of its own, but that all national appropriations for school pur­ poses should be placed under the con­ trol of the States, with only such guards as shall secure its faithful application to the purposes for which it was appro priated." The latest reports from inany of the leading winter wheat growing states, including Tennessee, Virginia, Ken* tucky, Maryland, Missouri, Kansas, Indiaua, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsyl vania, all of which excepting thy three latter states show a lar£tt decrease in area, compared with list year, varying from 10 to 33 1-3 per cent, nttd in ull the Southern states tlve condition is re ported very pov compared with last year. Ohio, Michigan and Pennsyl­ vania report a slight decrease in acre5 age tend fair condition. These facts are deemed important in their relation to the prices of wheat next year. The line officers of the army are pre­ paring to make a strong push for legis* atiou by congress to accelerate promo­ tions, which is now almost stagnant. A bill is to be introduced fixing the age for compulsoty retirement at a Inauttk lower figure than sixty-four, as now, and providing that captains shall go on the retired list at the age of fifty. I* is thought the passage of such a bill as this is the only possible method of keeping up the promotion of aged offi­ cers into position of usefulness in tile army in time of peace. It is not men­ tioned, and therefore deemed out of the question, to remedy tlio evil by reduc­ ing the number of cadets of West Points which is the nursery of army officers. A comparatively slight reduction would keep the chances of promotion, and really the number of officers now tn the army vastly out of proportion to the number of soldiers. The same evil prevails in the Navy, and to a greater extent. President Arthur approves of the rec­ ommendation of the postmaster-gen­ eral that the unit of weight in the rat­ ing of first class matter should be one ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is. He says in view of the statis­ tics furnished by the department it. may le well doubted whether the charge would result in any loss of revenue that it would greatly promote the con­ venience of the public is beyond dis­ pute. It is to be hoped that this change will be made. The saving of expense to the people would bo considerable, and a great source of annoyance avoided. Comparatively few people possess letter scales, and therefore cannot determine, in a vast number of canes, how much postage is required. Very frequently, too much postage is paid, to make sure of instant transmission, and still often* er, too little. "With c, two-cent stamp for one ounce, instead of half an ounce, 88 now, there would be no question in letter* 4° Vaat •, l|J.M*,"W*' t*

To the Congress of tke United States: Since the eta* of your last session the Amer­ ican people, in the exercise of their higha^ right of suffrage, have chosen their. eftfe* magistrate fgr thd four yean iS&suing. When it is r$0imbered t*m!, at no period in the count's flftYory has the long political con­ test which customarily precedes the day of the national election been waged with greater fervor and intensity, it Is a subject of congratulation that after the controversy at the polls was over, and while the felight preponderance by which the issue had been determined was as yet unascertained, the public peace suffered no disturbance, but the people eVe^whcfreViaWntly and quietly awaited Be fcoRnl* Nothing could more rtrikinjrly illustrate the temper of the American citizen, his love of order and his loyalty to law. Nothing Could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our politic*! Institutions Eight years have p&ssed since a controversy concerning the result of a national election sharply called the attention of the congress to the neces­ sity of providing more precise and definite regulations for counting the electoral Vote. It is of the greatest importance that thift question be solved before conflicting claims to the presidency shall again distract the country and I am persuaded that, by the people at large, any of the measures of re­ lief thus far proposed would be preferred to sontinued inaction. 

FORKTGN HKI.ATIONS, ENTIREI.T AMICAJ5IA Our relations with all foreign powetft fcdft tinue to be amicable. With Belgium a con­ vention has beteil signed whereby the scope of present treaties has beeA si eilaj^ti as to secure to citizens of cither fcountry within the jurisdiction of the other equal rights and privileges in the acquisition and a!ienationxf property. A trademark treaty has also been Concluded. The war between Chili atid Peru is at an end. For tfce Arbitration of the claims of Am'Hoan citizens who during its sowtiftuance suffered through the acts of the Chilian authorities, a convention will soon be negotiated. Tbe state of hostilities be­ tween France and China still teofttitittefc to be an embarrassing- feature ift oxir Eastern rela­ tions. The Chinese ^oVefctjiiient has promptly adjusted and Wd the claims of American tttizeiia Whose property was destroyed in chfe recent riots at Canton. I renew the rec­ ommendation of my last annual message, that the Canton Indemnity fund be returned to Chin* the true interpretation of tha recent treaty with that country permitting the restriction of Chinese immigration is likely to be a£aiti a subject of your deliberations. It may be seriously qttestitonM Whether the statute passed afc tft« last session does not Violate tne treaty rights of cer­ tain Chinese, who left this country with return certificates, valid under the old law, and now seem to be debarred from anding from lack of certificates required by the new. The recent purchases by the United States of a large trading fleet, here­ tofore under the Chinese flag, enhanced our commercial importance in the East Ih view of the large number Of vessels built or pur­ chased by America^ citizens in other coun­ tries and exclusively employed in legitimate trade between foreign ports under the rec­ ognized protection of our flag, it might be well to provide a uniform rate for their reg­ istration and documentation, so that the b°na ma^ority of ordinary People in all the large cities of the East who are aware of the low price of wheat are taxed as much as ever for flour and bread. This gross injustice elicits ^very strong compliments through the newspapers, and frequent suggestions are found in favor of govern­ ment regulation of this matter, as in Europe. There the law compels all bakers to make their loaves of a uni­ form weight, and the people know what they are buying aud how much a pound they are paying. Here, where wheat was never so low in the ©emory of liv­ ing man, the people are taxed as much as ever for flour and bread. In an in­ terview with a New York baker he said "Well, suppose flour has gone down, do yon suppose we're going to lower our price, so long as we have no trouble in .getting the prices we now ask? It •int reasonable to think so. I hope you newspaper fellows ain't a-going to play the same trick on us here as was played in England some time ago. Why, the London papers showed up the' bakers fearful. They said that though breadstuff's was low, bread was high and country papers followed suit and Lord bless you the bakers had to give in. SowiU we if it comes to the yftfc property rights of our citizens therein shall be duly evidenced and properly guarded. Pursuant to the advice of the sen­ ate at the last session, I recognized the flag of the International Association of THE 

CONGO Ss that of a friendly government, avoiding, In so doing, any prejudgment of the conflict in territorial claims in that region. Subse­ quently, in execution df the &cpre&ed wish of the congress, 1 s^jwihte^l a commercial hgent for the Congb basin. The Importance of the rich prospective trade of the Congo valley has led to a general conviction that it should be onen to all nations upon equal terms. An international conference for the consideration of this subject was called by the emperor of Germany, and is now in ses­ sion at Berlin. Delegates are in attend­ ance on behalf of the tTnited States Of the Hfciilts of the con­ ference JrtU will b« duly advised. The government of Corea has generally aid­ ed the efforts of the Uriited States minister to secure suitable premises for the United States legation. As the conditions of diplo­ matic intercourse with Eastern nations de­ mand that the legation premises be owned by the represented power, I advise that an appropriation be made for the acquisition of this property hy the government, The United 8tatefe already possesses valuable premises at Tangiers, as a gift from tbe feultah of Morocco, and they have lately received a similar gift from the Siamese government The govern­ ment Of Japan stands ready to present to us extensive grounds at Tokio, wherein to erect a suitable building for the legation court house and jail, and similar privileges can probably be secured in China and Persia. The owning of such premises would not only effect a large saving of the present rentals, but would permit of the due assertion of the extra territorial rights in these countries, and would the better serve to maintain the dignity of the United States. The failure of congress to make appropria­ tion for our representation at the court of the khedlve has proved a serious embarrass­ ment in our intercourse with Egypt and in view of the necessary Intimacy of diplo­ matic relationship due to'the participation of this government as one of the treaty powers in all matters of administration there affecting the rights of foreigners, I advise the restoration of the agency and consulate general at Cairo on its former basis. I do not conceive it to be the wish of congress that the United States Rhould withdraw altogether from the honorable po­ sition they have hitherto held with respect to the khedive, or that citizens of this re­ public residing or sojourning in Egypt should hereafter be without the aid of and protec­ tion of a competent representative. With France the traditional cordial relationship continues The Bartholdi statue of "Liberty Enlightening the World," tlve generous giftof the people of France, is expected to reach New York in May next I suggest that con­ gressional action be taken in relation to tbe spirit which has prompted this gift, and in aid of the timely completion of the pedestal on which it is to be placed Our relations with Germany, a country which contributes to ours some of the best elements of citizen­ ship, continue to be cordiaL The United States have extradition treaties with several of the German states, but by reason of the eonfedcration of these states under the penal rule, tbe application of such treaties Is not as uniform and comprehensive as the Interests of the two countries require. I propose, therefore, to open negotiations for a convention of extradition, to. embrace all the territory of the empire It affords me pleasure to say that our intercourse with 

QREAT BBJTAZK continues to be of a most friendly characters The government of Hawaii has indicated its willingness to continue for seven years tfe previsions of the existing reciprocity treaty. Such continuance, in view of the relations of that country to the American system of states, should, in my judgment, be favored. The revolution in Hayti against the estab­ lished govenment has terminated While it was in progress it became necessary to en­ force our neutrality laws by instituting pro­ ceedings against Individuals and vessels charged with their infringement These revolutions were in all cns&j successful. Much anxiety has lately been displayed by varfotfi European governments, and espe­ cially by the government of Italy, for the abolition of our import duties upon works of art It is well to consider whether the narrow discrimination in favor of the works of American artists, abroad la hot likely to result, afc they themselves sebm vety generally t6 belieVe it may, i& the prac­ tical occlusion of oUr painters and sculptors from the rich fields for observation, study and labor which they have hitherto enjoyed. There is a prospect that the long-pending revision of the foreign treaties of Jftjan may be concluded at a new Conference to be held at Tokio. While this government »oliy recog­ nizee the equal antj independent station of Japan in the community of nations, it would not oppose the general adoption of such terms of compromise as Japan may he dis­ posed to offer in furtherance ©f Uniform policy of intercourse With Western p&tiohs. Ourlng the past year.,tie increasing good between our bw'h 'government and that ofMexwp nas been variously manifested. I*ie treaty of commercial reciprocity con­ cluded Jan 20, 1883, has teen ratified and awaits tbe necessary tariff legisla­ tion of eongregg to become effectiveL fhi® legislation will, I doubt not, be among the first measures to claim your attention. A full treaty of commerce, navigation, and consular rights is much to be desired, and such a treaty I have reason to believe thift the Mexican government stands ready to oonclude. Some embarrassment, has Peen occasioned by the failure of cohgiress. at its last sesSioh TO Srevent provide. means for the due 'execution of the treaty of July 29,, 18&3, for the resurvey of the,Mexican boundary id the relocation of -boundary monuments, ith the republic of Nicaragua a treaty has been concluded which authorizes the con­ struction bv the United States of a canal, railway and telegraph lino across the Nica raguan territory. By the terms of this treaty sixty miles of the river San Juan, as well as the Lake Nicaragua, an inland sea forty miles in width* ate to con­ stitute a part of the projected gnterbrisg. This covers for actual eaiial construction seventeen miles On the Papitic side ahtt tliii- ty-sik miles .on tH5 Atlantic. To the United States, \vhose rich territory on the Pacihc is, fw the ordinary purposes of commerce, practically cut off from communication by water with Atlantic ports, the political and commercial advantages of such a project can scarcely be overestimated It is believed that when the treaty is laid before you the justice and liberality of its provisions will command universal approval at home and abroad. The death of our representative at Russia, while at his post at 8t. Petersburg, afforded to the imperial eroVerttment a re­ newed opportunity id. testify its sympaT thy itt a manner, befttting ..the iiUiniaie frienaliriess which has ever marked the intercourse of the two., countries, The cottroe Qf the government in raising its •Representative at Bangkok to the diplomatic rank has evoked from Siam evidences of warm friendship. The Siamese government has presented to the United States a commo­ dious mansion and grounds for the occu­ pancy of the legation, and I suggest that by Joint resolution congress attest its appre­ ciation of this generous gift. This govern­ ment has more than once been called on of late to take action in fulfillment of interna­ tional obligation toward Spain, agitation ih THR tStAW Of CUBA hestilfe t5o the Spanish crown having been fermented by persons abusing the sacred right' of hospitality which our territory affords. The officers of the government have been instructed to exercise vigilance to infractions of our neutrality laws at ey West and other ports near the Cuban coast I am happy to say that in the only Instance where these precautionary measures were successfully eluded, the offenders when found in our territory were subsequently tried and convicted The growing tieed of close relationship of iticercourse and traffic tfet\V"eeil the Spanish Antilles and their nat­ ural market in the United States led to the adoption, in January last, of a commercial agreement looking to that end. This agree­ ment has since been Superseded by a more carefully framed and comprehensive con­ vention, which I shall subject to the senate for approval. It has been the aim of this negotiation to open such a favored reciprocal exchange of production carried on under the flag of either country as to make the inter­ course between Cuba nnd Porto Rico and ourselves seaicely less intimate than the Commercial movement between otir domestic ports, and to insure a ramotal of the burdens oii shipping in the Spanish Indies, of which jtt tbe past Our shipowners arid shipmasters have so often had cause to complain. The negotiation of this convention has tor a time postponed the prosecution of certain claims of our citizens which Were declared to be without the jurisdiction of the late Span­ ish-American claims commission, and which are, therefore, remitted to diplomatic chan­ nels for adjustment The speedy settlement of these claims, will now be urged by this government Negotiations for a treaty of commercial reciprocity with the Dominican republic have been successfully concluded, and the result will shortlv be laid before the senate. Certain questions between the United States and the Ottoman empire still remain unsolved. Complaints in behalf of our citizens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The p'oirte has sought to withhold from our commerce the right of favored treatment to which we are' entitled by existing conven­ tional stipulations, and the revision of the tariff is unaccomplished. The final disposition of pending questions with Venezuela has not as yet been reached, but I have good reason to expect an early settlement, which will provide the means of re-examining the Caracas awards, in conformity with the ex­ pressed desire of congress, and which will recognize tbe justice of certain claims pre­ ferred against Venezuela. fcENTBAIi AND SOUTH AMERICA. The Central and South American commis­ sion, appointed by authority of the act of July, 1884, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has been furnished with instructions which will be laid before you. They contain a statement of the general policy of the gov­ ernment for enlarging its commercial inter­ course with American states The commis­ sioners have been actively preparing for their responsible task by holding confer­ ences in the principal cities with merchants and others interested in the Central and South American trade The International Meridian conference, lately convened in Washington, upon the invitation of the government of the United States, was com­ posed of representatives of twenty-five na? tions. The conference concluded its labors on the 1st of November, having with sub­ stantial unanimity agreed upon the meridian of Greenwich as the starting point whcnce longitude is to be computed, through 180 degrees eastward r.nd westward, and upon the adoption, for all purposes for which it may be found convenient, of a universal day, which shall begin at midnight on the initial meridian, and whose hours shall be counted from zero up to twenty four. The formal report of the transactions of this conference will be hereafter transmitted to congress. This government is in frequent reoeipt of in­ vitations from foreign states to participate in international exhibitions, often of great interest and importance. Occupying as we do an advanced position in the world's pro­ duction, and aiming to secure a profitable share for our industries in the general com­ petitive markets, it is a matter of serious concern that the want of means of partici­ pation in these exhibits should so often ex­ clude our producers from the advantages enjoyed by those of other countries. During the past year the attention of congress was drawn to the formal invitations in this re­ gard tendered by the governments of En­ gland, Holland, Belgium, Germany and Austria The executive has in some in­ stances appointed honorary commissionera This is, however, a most unsatisfactory ex­ pedient, for, without some provision to meet necessary working expenses of a commis­ sion, it can effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibitors. An international inventors' exhibition is to be held in London next May. This will cover a field of special im­ portance in which our country holds foremost rank, but the executive is at pres­ ent powerless to organize a proper represen­ tation of our vast national interests in this direction. I have in some previous messages referred to this subject It seems to me that a statute giving to the executive gen­ eral discretionary authority to accept such invitations and to appoint honorary com­ missioners without a'salary and placing at the disposal of the secretary of state a small fund for defraying their reasonable expenses wc uld be of great public utility. This government has received official notice that the revised international regulations for preventing collisions at sea have been adopt­ ed by all the leading maritime powers except the United States, and came into force on the 1st of September last For the due protec­ tion of our shipping interests, the provis­ ions of our statutes should at once.be brough into conformity with these regulations. Thn question of securing authors, composers ard artists copyright privileges in this country in return for reciprocial rights abroad is one that may justly challenge your attention. It is true that a convention will be necessary for fully accomplishing this result, but until congress shall fix the extent to which foreign holders of copyright hhall be here privileged, it has been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such convention. For this reason the United States were not represented at the recent conference at Berne. I recommend that the scope of the neutrality laws of the United States be ao enlarged as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed in our territory and •taed *eainstute pease of trftnidly iifttton. 4g r, ?r-» Existing statutes prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions and restrict the shipment of explosives, though the enactments in the latter respect were not framed with regard to international obligations, but simply for the protection of passenger travel. Ail these statutes were framed to meet the special •gi. _r. sort to aTihed vessels, or to filibustering parties, I see no reason why overt prepara­ tions in this country for -the commission of criminal acts such as aru here under con sideration should not be alike punishable whether such acts are intended to be.com­ mitted in our own country or in & country with Which we are at peace. ptompt and thorough treatment of th'- ques­ tion is one whu£ intimately" concerns the n&£lGaai Adnor. Our existing floh iifeigh KATtTBAUKATIOK LAWS only a historical interest.

There are special pro Visions of law favoring the naturalisation of those who serve in the army or in merchant vessels, while no similar privileges are granted those who serve in the navy or ma­ rine corps A uniform rule of tiaturaiiiM tiott fitlch tne constitution contemplates, should, among other things, clearly define the status of persons born within the United States, subject to a foreign power (seotion 1992), and of minor children of fathers who have declared their intention of becoming citizens, but have failed to perfect their nat­ uralisation. It might be well to provide for a central bureau of registry. Wherein should be filed authenticated tra^criptS Jf,. fetery record bf hatuirftligdtioh in the 'Several fed­ eral and state courts, and to make provision also for the vacation or cancellation of such record in cases where fraud had been prac­ ticed upon the court bv the applicant nim self, or where he had removed or forfeited his acquired citizenship. A just and uniform law in this respect would strengthen the hands of the government in protecting its citizens abroad, and would pave the way for the conclusion of treaties of naturalization with foreign countries. The legislation of the last session effected in the diplomatic and consular service certain changes nnd reductions which have been iroduefcive of embarassment The popttla and cdninierbial activity bf bur cduacrt are steadily oh the increase, atid tire giving rise to iiew. Varying and often delicate Re­ lationships with other countries Our for­ eign establishment now embraces nearly double the area of operations that it did twenty years ago. The confinement of such a service within the limits of expenditure then established is not, it seems to me, in ac­ cordance with true economy, and a com­ munity of sixty millions of people should be adequately represented in its intercourse with foreign nations A project for the re­ organization of the consular service and for recasting the scheme of extra territorial Ju­ risdiction is iiow before yott. If the limits of a short session will hot allow its full„coiisid eratioil, I trUst you will hot fail to make suitable provision for the present needs of the service. It has been customary to de­ fine in the appropriation acts the rank of each diplomatic office to which a salary is attached I suggest that this course be abandoned, and that it be left to the presi­ dent with the advice and consent of the sen­ ate, to fix from time to time th diplomatic grade of the representatives of this govern­ ment abroad, as may seem advisable pro­ vision being definitely made, however, as now, for the amount of salary attached to the respective stations. 

FINANCIAL. THE SECRETARY'S REPOBT. The condition of our finances and the operations of the various, branches of the public service which are connected with the treasury department are very fully dis­ cussed in the report of tbe secretary. It ap­ pears that the ordinary revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1884, were: From customs $11)5,007,489 76 From internal revenue 1'J1,58(.072 51 From all other sources 31,806,307 05 Total ordinary revenues....$348,519,809 02 The public expenditures during the same period were: For civil expenses For foreign intercourse. For Indians For pensions For the military establishments, including river and harbor im­ provements and arsenals 39,129,603 36 For he naval establishments, in­ cluding vessels, machinery and improvements at navy yards For miscollaueoiise xpenditures,in­ cluding public buildings, light houses and collecting the revenue 43,939,710 00 For expenditures on account of the Total merchandise.... Specie 22,312,907 71 1,260,766 37 6,475,999 29 65,429,228 36 Total $705,123.955 More than 63 per cent of the entire value of imported merchandise consisted of the following articles: Sugar and molasses. $103,884,274 Wool aud woolen manufactures 63,542,292 Silk and its manufactures 49,999,128 Coffee 49,686,706 Iron and steel and manufactures thereof 41.964,599 Chemicals 38,464,965 Flax, hemp, jute and like substances and manufactures thereof 33,463,338 Cotton and manufactures of cotton.. 30,454,476 Hides and skins other titan fur skins. 22,350,906 SILVER DOLLARS. I concur with the secretary of the treasury in recommending the immediate suspension of coinage of silver dollars and, of the issu­ ance of Bilver certificates, and this is a mat­ ter to which, in former communications, I have more than once invoked the attention of the national legislature. It appears that annually for the past six years there have been coined, in compliance with the act of Feb. 28, 1878, more than twenty-seven mil­ lion stiver dollars, and the number outstand­ ing is reported by the secretary to be nearly one hundred and eighty-five million, whereof but little more than forty mlllon, or less than 22 per cent, are in actual circulation. The mere existence of this fact seems to me to furnish of itself a cogent argument for the repeal of the statute which has made such a fact possible. But there, are other and graver considerations that tend in the same direction. The secretary avows his conviction that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely at no distant day to become our sole metallic standard The commercial disturbance and the impairment of the natioual credit that woulfi be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimated. I hope that the secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal from circulation of tbe $1 and $2 notes will re­ ceive your approval It is likely that a con­ siderable portion of the silver now incum­ bering the vaults in the treasury might thus find its way into the currency. While trade dollars have ceased, for the present at least, to be an element of active disturbance in our currency svstem, some provision should be made for their surrender to the government Tn view of the circumstances under which they were coined, and of the fact that they have never had a legal tender quality, there should be offered for them only a slight ad­ vance on their bullion value The secretary, in the course of his report,. considers the propriety of beautifying the designs of our subsidiary silver coins, and of so increasing their weight that they may bear due ratios of value of the standard dollar. Bis conc u sions in this regard are cordially approved 

TAXATION. In my annual message of 1882 I recom­ mended the abolition of all excise taxes ex­ cept those relating to distilled spirits. This recommendation is now renewed In case these taxes shall be abolished the revenues that will still remain to the government will, in my opinion, not only suffice to meet its reasonable expenditures, but will afford a. surplus large enough to permit suoh tariff re­ duction as may seem to be advisable when the results of the recent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters these reductions can be most judiciously effected. One of the gravest of the problems which appeal to the wisdom of congress for solution is the ascertainment of the most effective means of increasing our foreign trade, and thus relieving the depres­ sion in which our industries are now lan­ guishing. The secretary of tbe treas­ ury advises that the duty of in­ vestigating this subject tfc entrusted v\ t80.63 17,292,601 46 District of Columbia 3,407,049 63 For interest on the public debt.... 04,578,378 48 For the sinking l'und 46,790,229 50 Total ordinary expenditures. ...$-290,916.483 83 Leaving a surplus of $57,603,396.09. As com­ pared with the preceding fiscal year there was a net decrease of over $21,000,000 in the amount or expenditures. The aggregate receipts were less than those of the vear previous by about $74,000,000. The fafling off of revenue from customs made up nearly $20,000,000 of the deficiency, and about $23,000,000 of the remainder was due to the diminished receipts from internal taxa­ tion. The secretary estimates the total re­ ceipts for the fiscal year, which will end June 30, 1885, at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures at $290,620,201, in which are included the interest on debt and amount payable to the sinking fund. This would leave a surplus for the entire year of about $39,000,000. The value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during tbe year ending June 30, 1884, was as follows: Domestic merchandise. $724,964,852 Foreign merchandise 15.548.757 ...$740,513, G()9 ... $67,133,383 Total exports of merchandise and speoie $807,646,992 The cotton and cotton manufactures in­ cluded in this statement were valued at $208,900,415, the breadstuff's at $162,544, 715. the provisions at $114,416,547 and the minerals at $47,103,248. During the same period the imports were as follows: Merchandise $C4B,697,693 Gold and silver 37,426,262 '^vy.TT rVjr In the drat instance to a competent commis­ sion.

The bonds of that issue still outstanding amount to a little over $200,000,000, about one-fourth of which will be retired through the opera­ tions of the Binkmg fund during the coming year. As these bonds still continue the chief factor of the circulation of the national banks, the question how to avert the eon traction of the CurtenCy Caused bf their M tireiiiatft ib piie bf tidiistahtly iiicr.*asj^ng im­ portance. It seems to be generally conceded that the law governing this matter exacts from the banks excessive security, and that on their present bond deposits a larger cir­ culation than is now allowed mav be granted with perfect safety. I hope that the bill whioh passed the senate at the last session, permitting the issue of notes equal to the face value of deposited bonds, will commend itself to the approval of the house of repre sentativea THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. DECREASED EXPENSeS. In Jhe expenses of the war department the eeeretairy f&portt a decrease of mote than sp.p00,00Q, of which a reduction of $5,d00. 000 was effected in expenditures for livers and harbors and $2,700,000 in expenditures for the quartermaster's department Out­ side of that department the annual expenses for all the army bureaus proper (except probably the ordnance bureaus) are sub­ stantially fixed charges which cannot be ma­ terially diminished without a change in the numerical strength of the army. The ex­ penses in the quartermaster's department can readily be subjected to administrative discretion, and it is reported by the secre­ tory of war that as a result of exercising such discretion in reducing the num­ ber of .^draught and, tyick animals in the army, the annual cost pf supply­ ing and caring for such animals is now $1,108,085.90 less than it was in 1882. The reports of military commanders show that the last year has been notable for its freedom from Indian outbreaks. In defiance of the president's proclamation of ..July 1, 1884, certain intruders sought to make set­ tlements in the Indian Territory. They were promptly removed by a detachment of troons. During the past session of congress a bill to provide a suitable fire-pioof build­ ing for the army medical museum and the library of the surgeon general's office re­ ceived the approval of the sqnate. A similar bill, reported favorably to the house of rep­ resentatives by one of its committees, is still pending before that body. It is noped that during the coming sassion the mea sur may become a law, and thereafter imme­ diate steps may be taken to secure a place of safe deposit for the valuable collections now in a state of insecurity. The funds with which the works for the improvements of rivers and harbors were prosecuted during the past year were derived from the appropriations of the agt of Aug. 2, 1882, together with such few balances as were on hand from pre­ vious appropriations. The balance of the treasury subject to requisition July 1, 1883, was $10,021,649.55. The amount appro­ priated during the fiscal year 1884 was $13,196.346.27,and the amount drawn from the treasury during the fiscal year was 8,228,703.54, leaving alalance ot $3,112, in the treasury subject to requisition July 1,1884. 

SEACOAST DEFENSES. The secretary of war submits the report of the chief of engineers as to the practicabil­ ity of protecting our important cities on the seaboard, by fortifications and other de­ fenses able to repel modern methods of at­ tack. The time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive and when the possible results of delay in making such preparations is seriously considered, delav seems inexcusable. For the most important cities, those whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation, adequate defenses, inclusive of guns, may be made by the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000, a sum much less than a victorious enemy could levy as a contribution. An appropria­ tion of about one-tenth of that amount is asked to begin the work, and I concur with the secretary of war in urging that it be granted. The war department is proceed­ ing with the conversion of ten-inch smooth­ bore guns into eight-inch rifles, by lining the former with tubes of forged or of cod wrought iron. Fi ty guns will be thus con­ verted within the year. This, however, does not obviate the necessitv of providing means for the construction oi guns of the high­ est power, but for the purposes of coast de­ fense and for the armament of war vessels The report of the gun foundry board ap­ pointed April 2. 1883, in pursuance of the act of March 3, 1883, was transmitted to congress in a special message of Feb. 8,1884. In my message or March 26, 1884,1 called attention to the recommendation of the board that the government should encourage the production at private steel works of the required material for heavy cannons, and that two government factories, one for the army and one for the naVy, should be estab­ lished for the fabrication of guns of such material. No action having been taken, the board was subsequently reconvened to determine more fully the plans and esti­ mates for carrying out its recommendations It has received information which indicates that there are responsible steel manufactur­ ers in this country who, although not pro­ vided at present with the necessary plant, are willing to construct the same and to make bids for contracts with the govern­ ment for the supply of the requistc material for the heaviest uiis adapted to modern war fare, if a guaranteed order of suilicient mag­ nitude. accompanied by a positive appropria­ tion extending over a series of years, shall be made by congress All doubts as to the feasibility of the plan being thus removed, 1 renew my recommendation that such ac tion be taken by congress as will enable the government to construct its own ordnance upon its own territory, and so to provide the armaments demanded by considerations of national safety and honor. THE 

NAVV. THE NEW CRUISERS. The report of the secretary of the navy ex­ hibits the progress which has been made on the new steel cruisers authorized by the acts of Aug. 5, 1882, and March 30, i883. Of the four vessels under contract one, the Chi cago, of 4,500 tons, is more than half finished the Atlanta, 3,000 tons, has been successfully launched, and her machinery is now fitting the Boston, dlso of 3,000 tons, in ready for launching and the Dolphin, a dispatch steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for delivery. Certain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers are discussed by the secretary, who insists that the correct­ ness of the conclusions reached by the ad­ visory board and the department has been demonstrated by recentdevelopments in ship­ building abroad. The machinery of the double-turreted monitors, Puritan, Terror and Amphitrite, contracted for under the act of March 3,1883, is in process of con­ struction. No work has been due during tbe past year on their armor, for lack of the necessary appropriations. A fourth mon­ itor, the Monadnook, still remains un finished at the navy yard in California. It is recommended that early steps be taken to complete these vessels, and to provide also an armament for the monitor Miantonomah. The recommendations of tbe naval advisory board, approved by the department, com' prise the construction of one steel cruiser of 4,500 tons, one cruiser of 3,000 tons, two heavy-armed gunboats, one light cruising gunboat, one dispatch vessel armed with Hotchkiss cannon, one armed ram and three torpedo boats The general designs, all of which are calculated to meet the existing wants of the service,nre now well advanced, and the construction of the vessels can be undertaken as soon as you shall grant the necessary authority. THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS. The act of congress approvied Aug. 7,1882, authorized the removal to the United States of the bodies of Lieutenant Commander G. W. De Long and his companions^ the Jean nette expedition. The removal has been suc­ cessfully accomplished The remains were taken from their grave in the Lena delta, in March, 1883. but were letained at Yakutsk until the following winter, the season being too far advanced to admit of their immediate transportation. They arrived at New York Feb. 20, 1884, where they were received with suitable honors. In pursuance of the joint resolution of congress approved Feb. 13, 1884, a naval expedition was fitted out for the relief of Lieut A. W. Oreely, United States army, and of the party wto had been engaged under his command in scientific observations at Lady Frankl bay. The fleet consisted of the steam sealer Thetis, purchased in England the Bear, purchased at St John's, Newfound­ land, and the Alert, w^jh was generously nrovided Ler the Britisirgovemment prep- mr aratlons for the expedition were promptly made bv the secretary of the navy, with tht active co-operation of the hecretary of war. Commander George W. Coffin was placed in command of the Alert, and Lieut W. H. Em­ ery in command of. the Bear. The Theis was intrusted to Commander Wlnfleld a Schley, to whom also was assigned tbe su­ perintendence of the entire expedition. Im­ mediately upon its ttrtiVal at ^pernavik. the fleet began the dangeious ila vigati&ii of Melville bftV, ana °f every obstacle, reached Littleton islnmfTHl june 22. a fortnight earlier than any vessel had oe *e attained that point On the same day it •oSS&a fca Cape Sabine., where Lieut Greeley and tithe* KurWVors of his party were discovered After taklhg on board tne living and the bodies of the dead, the relief ships Bailed for 8t John's, where they arrived on Juiy 17. They were appro­ priately received at Portsmouth, K. H., on Aug. 1. and at New York on Aug. 8. One of the bodies was lauded at the former place. The others were'put on shore at Governor's island, and with the exception of Otte, whiehwao lhtenred in the national cemetery, iferei forwarded tlietlOfl to-the destination in didated by friepds. The ergafliiflUon and conduct of the feligf- expedition reflects great credit upon all who cOEtriWMwn .to its success. In this, the last of the state iSes sages that 1 shall have the honor to transmit to the, congress of the United States. I can­ not Cue Strongly urge on its attention the duty of restoring our flUfy as rapidly as pos­ sible to the high state of efficiency Whiwh formerly characterized it As tbe long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied se­ curity may at any time be disturbed, it is plain thai the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by consid cratiofls of use, economy, of Just regard for our future tranquility and of true appreoia* tidtl 0f the dignity and honor of this reptib* lia POSTAL AFFAIRS. TBI SEDUCTION IN LETTER POSTAOI. The report of the postmaster general ac­ quaints you with the present condition and needs of the postal service. It dfoeieses the gratifying fact that the loss of revenue £rcfffl the reduction in the rate of letter postage, as recommended in my message of December, 1882 and effected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been muoh less than was generally anticipated My recommendation of this reduction Was based upon the belief that the a£tuaiiaiiiftg ojiin receipts from letter post* age for the year imm^diiitcjly Succeeding the change of rate would be $3,000,060. It h&S proved to .be only $2,275,000. This is a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon be restored to its former, volume by natural increases of sealed correspondence^ I confidently repeat, therefore, the recom­ mendation of my last annual message, that tbe single rate of postage upon drop letters be reduced to one cent wherever the pay­ ment of two cents is now required by law. The double rate is only exacted at offices where the carrier system is in operation, and it appeals that at these offices the in­ crease in tax tipoti, ideal fetters defrays the cost not only of its owii fc^llecbiojl and delivery, but of tbe collection and deliv­ ery of all other mail matter, and this is an irregularity that ought no longer to exist I approve the recommendation of the post­ master general that the unit of weight in the rating of first-class matter should bp:.pne ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the de­ partment, it may be well doubted whether the change would result in any loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the convenience of the public is beyond dispute. The free delivery system has been lately applied to five cities, and, t^je total number of offices in which it is now ih operation ia 159. Experience 6howB that its adoption under proper conditions is equally an accom­ modation to the publio and an advantage to the postal service. It, is more than self-sustaining, and, for the .reasons urged by the postmaster general, may properly be extended. It is the opinion of that officer that it is proper to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-delivery offices may be secured by the payment of extra­ ordinary postage. This scheme may be made effective by the employment of a special stamp, whose cost shall be commen­ surate with the expense of the entire extra service. In some of the large cities private express companies have undertaken to out­ strip the government mail carriers by afford­ ing, for the prompt transmission of letters, better facilities than have hitherto been at the command of the postoffice. It hat always been the policy of the government tc discouitige such enterprises, and in no bettei way can that no. icy be maintained than in supplying the public with the most efficient service that, with due regard to its own best interests, can be furnished for ita recom­ mendation. 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. PROPOSED REPORSTS. The attorney general renews the recom­ mendation contained in his report of last year, touching the fees of witnesses and jurors He favors radical change in the fee bill, the adoption of a system by which at­ torneys and marshals of the United States should be compensated solely by salaries and the erection by the government of a penitentiary for the confinement of offend­ ers against its laws. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. SECRETARY TELLER'S RECOMMENDATIONS. Of the varied governmental concerns in charge of the interior department, the re­ port of its secretary presents an interesting summary. Among the topics deserving par­ ticular attention I refer you to his observa­ tions respecting our Indian affairs, the pre­ emption and timber culture acts, tbe failure of railroad companies to take title to lands granted by the government and the opera­ tions of the pension office, the patent office, the census bureau and bureau of education. Allusion has been made already to the cir­ cumstance that both as between different Indian tribes and as between the Indiaus and the whites, the past year has been one of unbioken peace. In this circumstance the president is glad to find justification for the policy of the government in dealing with the Indian question, and confirmation of views which were fully expressed in his first com­ munication to the Forty-seventh congress The secretary urges a new enactment of a statute for the punishment of crimes com­ mitted on Indian reservations, and recom­ mends the passage of tbe bill now pending in the house of representatives, for the pur­ chase of a district of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux reservation. Both these measures are worthy of approval. I concur with him also in advising the repeal of the pre-emption law, the enactment of statutes resolving the present legal complications touching lapsed grants to railroads, and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads under 6uch enarantee as shall in­ sure its ultimate payment 

UTAH. STRINGENT MEASURES SUGGESTED. The report of the Utah commission will be read with interest It discloses the results of recent legislation looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that terri­ tory. I still believe that if that abominable practice cannot be suppressed by law, it can only be dealt with by tne most radical legis­ lation consistent with the restraints of tne constitution. I again recommend, therefore, that congress assume absolute political con­ trol of the Territory of Utah, and provide for tho appointment of a commission, with such governmental powers as in its judg­ ment may justly and wisely be put into their hands. FOREIGN TRADE. HOW TO EXTEND IT. In the course of this communication refer­ ence has more than once been made to the policy of this government as regards the ex­ tension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare the general principles that should, in my opinion, underlie our nation 1 efforts in this direction. The main conditions of the problem may be thus stated: We are a people rich in mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention wecoveravastextentof territory, rich in agricultural products and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manufacture. We have a system of productive establishments more than sufficient to supply our demands. The wages of labor are nowhere so great The scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher moral and intellectual qual­ ities that go to the making of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present needs of the government These are elements from which it is sought to de­ vise a scheme by which, without unfavora­ bly chanaring tbe condition of workingmen, our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets pro­ vided for the sale, beyond our borders, of the manifold fruits of our industrial enterprise. The problem is complex and can be solved by no single measure of innovation or re­ form. The countries of the American conti­ nent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natural market of supply and demand It is from them that we should obtain what we do not produce, or do not produce in sufficiency, ana it is to them that surplus productions of our fields, our mills, ana our workshops should flow, under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with foreign competition, four paths of pcgicy seem to point to this end. Fiist, a series of reciprocal commercial treaties shall foster between the United States am chom an unhampered movement of trade. The conditions of -theetf tNMiis should be the free admission of such' t3efch»ndlse as this country does not produce, in retitttt for the admission free or under a favored scheme of dudes of our own products, the benefits of such exchange to apply on those goods carried under the flag or the' parties to the contract the removal on' both sides from Ves&l* W. privileged of all tonnage dues and national Ittttjtfrte, so' that' their vessels tuay ply unhindered b£6*eea:our ports and those of tiie other contracting parties, though without infringing on' the^ri&erved home coasting trade. The removal ot burdens on the exported countries coming with the treaties, and the avoidance of the feftfWCCalities, restrictions, Secoudly, the establishment of tiw eonsular service of the United States on .a salaried [ooting, permitting the relinquishment ot oonsular fees for not only as respects vessels consular fees for not only under the national flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty nations carrying goods entitled to the benefits of the treaties. Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor thecpnstruetion and maintenance of a steam carry iuV fttorimi Under tbe flag of the United Statea Fourthly, ttw establishment of an uniform currency basis ldf the countries of America, so that the coined products of our mines may circulate on equal terms throttgh oift the whole system of commonwealths. This woitfld require a monetary union of America, whereby the eutput of tbe bullion producing countries and Urt circulation of chose which yield neither gold SW silver, could be adjusted in conformity with the pop­ ulation, wealth and commercial needs of each. As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock, tbe surplus production if our mines and mints might thusbe utilized and a step taken toward the general remone fit*ttojj of silver. To the accomplishment of these encTS,' to tax. as they can be attained by separate treaties, ftfe negotiations already concluded and now in prfijm* have been directed, and tho favor with wniSfe thi* enlarged policy has thus far been received war/arts ttie. tyelief that its operations will, ere long, embrao# #11 nearly all the coun­ tries of this hemisphere. It Is by no means desirable, however, that the pffllcy under consideration should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful enlargement of our trade with Europe. Asia and Africa should be sought by reducing tariff burdens on such of their wares as neither we nor the other American states are fitted to produce, atid ^11$ enabling ourselves to obtain in re­ turn a betted .market for our supplies of food, of raw material and of the manufactures in which we ft seems to me that many of the emban^il^ ele­ ments in the great national conflict between protecti6'fi atra free trade may thus be turned to good account* (bat the revenue may be reduced so as no longer t»v«rtax the peo­ ple the protective duties may be *«tained without becoming burdensome that our shipping interests may be judiciously en­ couraged, the currency fixed on a firm basis, and above all snch a Unity of interests estab­ lished among the states of the American sys­ tem as Will be of great and ever increasing advantage ft thein alL Ail treaties in the line of this polic'y Which have been nego­ tiated. or are in pi oeesft of b$ing negotiated, contain a provision deemed to be requisite under the clause of tbe constitution limiting C?,the house of representatives the authority to' originate bills for raising revenue. nome ooasnng reduction of bui products, at those & the beffelro and specialties by 1or& intercourse hi a^few feeliiy remarks, mad» fonnrtai* 2*th those£unteies4s at prdMMpampered THE 

CIVIL* fvfeltflCE. WORK OF THE LAW AND COMMLSSF6^. On the 29th of February last I transmitted to congress the first annual report of the civil service commission, together with com­ munications from the heads of the several revenue departments of the government, respecting the forking of the law under which the comission has fre£ft acting. The good resulte therein foreshadowed fte?* been more thau realized. The system has fully answered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faithful public ser­ vants, and in protecting the appointing offi­ cers of the government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for ublic employment. The law has bad the unqualified support of the president and of the heads of the several de­ partments, and the members of the commis­ sion have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their report will shortly be submitted, and will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall commend them­ selves to the executive and the commission, ere "barged with the administration. 

MISCELLANEOUS, BANKRUPTCY—THE CHOLERA. In view of the general persistent demand throughout the commercial community for a national bankrupt law, I hope that the differences which have hitherto prevented its enactment may not outlast the present ses­ sion. The pestilence which for tho past two years has been raging in the countries of the East recently made its appearance (ft European port* with which we are in con­ stant communication. The then secretary of tbe treasury, in pursuance of a proclamation of the president, issued certain regulations restricting, and for a time prohibiting the importation of Rigs iiid the admission of baggage of immigrants and Of travelers ar­ riving from infected quarters Lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law, I approve the recommendation of th€ present secretary, that congress take action In the premises, and I also recommend the Immediate adoption of such measures as will be likely to ward off the dreaded epi­ demic. and to mitigate its severity in case it shall unhappily extend to our shorea 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The annual report of the commissioners of the District of Columbia reviews the opera­ tions of the several departments of its mu­ nicipal government, and I ask your careful consideration of its suggestions in respect to legislation, especially commending such as re.ate to a revision of the civil and criminal code, the performance of labor by persons sentenced to imprisonment in the jail, the construction and occupation of wharves along the river front and the erection of a suitable building for district offices. I rec­ ommend that in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, the general of the armies of the United State.* and twice president of the nation, congress confer upon him a suitable pension. The measures that seem to me necessary and expedient have now, in obeyance to the constitution, recom­ mended for your adoption. As respects others of no less importance I shall coutent myself with renewing the recommendations already made to the congress without restat­ ing the grounds upon which such recommen­ dations were based: The preservation of forests on the public domain thegrant.ng of government aid for popular education the amendment of the federal constitution so as to make effective the disapproval hy tho president of particular items in appopri ation bills the enactment of statutes in re­ gard to the filling of vacancies in the presi­ dential office, and the determining of vexed questions respecting presidential inability, are measures which may justly receive your serious consideration As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service. I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of the national legislature, with whom I have been brought into per­ sonal and official intercourse, my sincere ap­ preciation of their unfailing courtesy, nnd of their harmonious co-operation with the executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation and to my fellow citizens generally I acknowl­ edge a deep sense of obligation for the sun port which they have accorded me in the ad­ ministration of the executive department of the government [Signed] 

CHESTER A. ARTHUR. WAbHiNOTON, D. C., Dec. 1, 1884. HOW DOTTIE KILLED THE 'GATOR. Miss Dottie Steck of Dell wood. Pa., who is visiting relatives at Little Rock, Ark., is the heroine of the day. For years a monster alligator has inhabited the swamps near Tucker's lake, Jeflereon county, scaring peo­ ple for miles around. Miss Steck determined to capture the monster. She set out with two young ladies and several gent emen. The party soon struck the trail and tracked the alligator to his den. A hole in the sandy bank indicated the location, and a few min­ utes1 digging revealed the object of the search, and the ominous growls and furious lashings that arose from the spot in­ formed the adventurers that the king of reptiles was within. The egress from the den to the lake having been securely stopped up, tbe enraged beast found its avenue of escape cut off, and rushed up and down its bed uttering wicked growls, furiously lash­ ing the mud, and scattered the water mall directions Pieces of timber and fence rails were pushed into its mouth, only to be crushed and snapped off by its ponderous jaws. A rope and chain, made into a lasso, was thrown over the brute's head Then he was suddenly jerked to the bank. The appearance of the monster in the midst of the venturesome party created a panic, and all save the Heroine beat a hasty retreat, selecting the further side of a friendly oak as a place of safety. With gun in hand, the young lady stood within a few feet of the now thoroughly en. raged beast, which was growling, struggling and slashing its tail on tbe ground in a frightful manner, and when the opportunity presented itself she fired both barrels ih rapid succession. The aim did its work. The alligator gave tremendous lurches and roared, and expired. Both shot- had entered one of tbe few penetrable places, at the ba«e of the jaw. It measured a fraction over ten feet In length. The hide was removed and to in the poasesaion of Mua Stock.
