tho Panama route wo aro told that tho Monroo Doctrine has no applica tion to tho case that a niero privato en tcrprito can by no possibility bring up any international question and that therefore Congress is not warranted in meddling witli the business To all of which wo beg leave to dissent We aro fully awaro that what is culled tho Mom oo Doctrine is no part of the Constitution or laws of tho United States It is simply tho declaration by a patriotic President of what ho rightly believed to bo tho universal sentiment of tho American peoplo concerning Kuropean intervention in tho affairs of tho Western Hemisphere Tho language of the famous declaration which was inado in Piosident Monroos annual message December 2 1823 is as follows Wo owe It to candor and to the amicable relation existing between the United States and thu Euro peon lovvcr to declare thnt wo should consider any attempt on their part to eittmt tlittr talent to any portion of this hemisphere tut dangerous to our peace and safety Willi the exlslfns colonies and dependencies Europvnn Power we have not Interfered and shall nut Interfere lint with the covemmenl which havo declared their Inde pendence and

vtlicr maimer llirlr ileMnu by a Euroiwan Power In any other lluht than as tlio manifestation ofan unfriendly disposition tovvurd the United mates This declaration voices tho will of tho American people Its letter and spirit concur Jt docs not merely deprccato the extension of Kuropean systems to this half of tho world but clearly and without equivocation says that this country would regard as unfriendly any attempt by n Kuropean Power to attempt to roiitrol in any manner tho destiny of any Independ ent government on this heinisphcie If any hair splitting statesman shall attempt to overthrow tho Monroo Doctrine be cause it has never been otherwise formu lated than as above or becauso it lias liovcr been enacted by Congress ho will Hire us badly as Senator John M Clayton did when hu mado tlio fame attempt in 1833 If any party speaking through ita representatives in Congress should treat tho declaration as anything less than a cherished tradition and a deeply planted sentimont in tho American heart that party would godownat tho next election Mr Thomson tells the interviewers that lie does not antagonize tho Monroo Doctrino that ho is to be an ollicer of a comiuuiy engaged In a privato enterprise and that at any time when American in tercsU bhall bo in jeopardy ho v ill resign Wo entertain for tho ex Secretary the kind feelings with which ho inspires all who como in

NATIONAL KEPUBLIOAST THUBSPAY MOIOTDSTG DECEMBER 16 1880 branch If they had any Unexpressed and anti American design then ho should be unwilling to servo their purposes Slnco 1835 tho subject of an Isthmus Canal lias been repeatedly ogltatcd in Congress The importance of having a water passage connecting tlio two oceans and obvintlng the necessity oMlio long and dangerous passage around Capellorn has not been deemed greater than the imporumeo of having it open to tlio frco and equal navigation of ail nations But under what guaranty Bhall this freedom and equality oxist Aro tho French capitalists likely to depend upon the weak government of Panama to pro tect their right to collect reasonablo tolls from tho worlds commerco Will tho French government withhold protection to its adventurous citizens What con cessions has tho Panama government made to tho Do Lcssops company What Becrct negotiations on tlio subject havo been aro being or may hereafter bo made between Franco and the govern ment of Panama7 Aro American inter ests safe when under foreign auspices n company witli a foreign charter engages millions of dollars in nn onterpriso which invades Central America to cut it now road for comnicrco between Western Kurope and the rich Ent Havo Ameri cans nothing to say why a French or other Kuropean toll gatherer should not tako possession of tho short water routo to tho Pacific and sit exacting tribute at the gateway between our Kattern and our far Western States Tlio French Company understood if Mr Thompson does not that our people would bo exceedingly scnsltivo on this question They desired to placato tho feeling in advance They determined to make an appeaninco of enlisting Ameri can capital They determined also to offset if possible tlio harm already dono them by tho Presidents communication to Congress on tho subject Tho Ilrt of theso was easily dono by tlio advertise ment of n prospectus and vague pub lished btatements as to subscriptions The second was amore dltllciilt matter j but at last the plan was hit upon It was not to securo the services of Mr K V Thompson of Tcrro Haute Ind Had this been the wish ho would have resigned and gono to Tcrro Haute before entering the French concern No The schemo was not as wo have said to employ Mr Thomp on but to go Into tiie Govern ment of the United States and employ the Secretary of the Navy as the seeming head of what should seem an American branch of an objectionablo pcrchaneo an inadmissible project connected with American interests This would seem llko American acquiescence and encour age subscriptions Tho scheme is a harmless one It is safe to let whatever company chooses to do so demonstrate the impracticability of the Panama route But it is not safe to allow tho occasion to pass without somo declaration by Congress which will mako known to tho world tho Nations determination never to tolerate Kuropean primacy on tho Isthmus or allow a European toll gate to bo hung ou any American highway American protection for ovcry American interest in North South and Central America Tills is manifest destiny The NoKro In tlio South Tho negro is to day regarded by the whito peoplo of the South precisely us he has been for two hundred years Thero never has been a time sinco tho founda tion of this Government when the South ern people as a people looked upon tho negro as capable in nny degree of self government much less as capablo of shaping or contributing in any manner to tho creation of laws and constitutions under which he in common with them selves was to live ond prosper That the people of tho South look upon tho negro in tills light is not strange Fromthoday tho Irstenrgoofslaveswashindedonthobanks of tho James in 1020 down to tho dawn of reconstruction in 1807 at the fireside in the play ground in tho field in tlio shop in tho press at tho bar on tho bench in tlio pulpit on tho public plat form and in the halls of legislation of tho South tho broad declaration was mado and Insisted upon that the negro was an inferior being whose highest good was to bo found in serfdom Thero never roo a man of nny political party in the South taking issue witli this infamous declara tion who was not silenced by public opinion and forced cither to change his views or withdraw from public lifo Nothing is truer than that Washington Jefferson Madison and Monroo meas ured fully tho evils of human slavery deprecated its existence in the new He public and earnestly desired its extinc tion Washington died before slavery becamo the god of tho South while Jef ferson Madison and Monroe lived to see tho unholy institution grow into gicat propottions and were compelled to yield to the demands mado or its support and extension What is true of thcbo great men is tmo oho of tho statesmen of tlio South without exception Few men over spoke words of moio prophetic power nnd import than Henry Clay regarding the horrors of slavery and tho blessings of freedom Yet oven Ills imperial will yielded to the siren song of tho slave power Tho early annals of abolition show thai at tho close of tho devolution thero ex isted in many parts of tlio South quite a body of citizens notably among tho Quakers and Methodists who wcro in favor of tlio abolition of Bluvery yet in side of forty years this sentiment died out entirely and those among whom it existed either lapsed Into utter quiet or sought a country whero tho oxpiossion of their views would not entail upon them loss of social position if not of lifo itself May wo not truly Bay that tho South hos been educated to look upon tho negro ns unfit for freedom and necessarily unfit for any pat ticipation in Government When tho North fined tlio negro wo struck down n faith tho South had cherished for more than twohundrcd years Whenwoelothcd him with tlio right of franchise wo vio lated a fundamental priuciploof Southern thcoilcs ii ml when wo placed him in offi cial position wo outraged ovcry cherished idea nnd instinct of tho Southern whites Such being tho case tho South to day pro fessedly assents to negro sutlVage not be causo its peoplo bellevo it is n right to which he is entitled or which hots In nny way qualified or competent tOciijoybutfor two reasons first tlioy uro powerless to le gally prevent it and secondly becauso by conceding tho negiothoilghttovotetheir political power in tho way of national rep resentation is increased to a very large dcgieo Hating tlio sourco from which tliiB added powor springs they still value that powor sufficiently to protest against tho nogcs disfranchisement Thelrfirat thought was and wherovor tlioy have gono into power in tho South they havo acted upon thnt thought wo will take the power the negro gives us but wo will sco to It that ho derives no advantago from It Actltignpon tills idea In all the South to day tho whites havo accom plished their designs They havo secured political power from tho numerical strength of the negro while as a rule they havo reduced him to an absoluto nullity so far as participating in tho Government is concerned A Healthy Urcczo from tlio South Senator Brown of Georgia mado a most sensible nnd practical speech yester day It was progressive and patriotic How il must havo startled somo of tho Northern Democratic Senators Tho Notion will spring into a new life if such utterances as theso can find n generous response among tho South ern people Wo bellevo that bravo leadership Is tho ono thing needed In Senator Browns speech thoro is no hatred or dcflnnco on tho ono hand no apology nor obsequiousness on the other It abounds in truth nnd counsels wise tie cepsoncoof national nld in tho great work of education so necessary for tho progress and improvement of tlio South How long will It bo before such senti ments prevail ovcrywhero Cannot the South learn that she Is nottoconsldertho changes thnt havo taken place as her degradation Her industrial system has gono down because It was not in harmony with tlio spirit of age and licr social structure so far as it was oristocrotlo and exclusive could not survivo the death of the feudalism on which it was based But her future is to bo much greater than her past It remains for tlio present generation to say whether they will bo a part of the now growth or whether their beloved section shall await their decay and tho infusion of new blood About StcnlliiK u Sent In tlio United States Semite If a majority voto can unseat n Senator after ho has been duly sentcd as the re sult of a contest then the validity of such action would not be limited to any ono Senator Show us tho road sold tho late Zacli Chandler how to vacato scats in this body by a majority vote if you darol Ifii mojority voto cannot unseat a Sen ator after ho has prevailed in one contest then any such attempted nctlon in Sen ator Kelloggs case would bo a nullity and ho would be as much entitled to speak and vote afterward os he hod been before Tho Vice President would prob ably so rule On nn appeal tho Senate would reverse this during tho remainder of this session but that would bo easy of correction on the of March if tho Ilupubl leans including Senator Kellogg were in the majority
