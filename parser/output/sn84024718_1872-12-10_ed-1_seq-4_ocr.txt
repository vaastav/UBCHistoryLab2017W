THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The fourth annual message of President Grant was delivered to Congress on Monday of last week, the 2od inst. In lieu of publish ing it in extenso, we publish a synopsis of it, as it would, if published in full, occupy most of our space to the exclusion of tbe news and would not be read by one iv twenty of our readers. — Tbe synopsis we give below will be read and will give the reader all tbe information respect ing its recommendations which tbe full text would furnish. It commences wih a recognition of tbe bless ings which the American people have erjoyed with in the past year, the only exception being the great fire in Boston. It refers to tbe Geneva arbitration and its satisfactory results, which left the two govern ments, American and English, without a shadow on their friendly relations, which, it is sincerely hoped, may forever remain equally unclouded. It recommends the immediate crea tion of a board of commissioners to decide on the amounts to be paid individuals. It compliments Mr. Adams and Mr. Bancroft Davis for their eminent services in the matter of tie Geneva and the San Juan arbitra i >n-; the decisioo of tbe latter leaving the United States for the first time without any question as to disputed b undaries. In regard to rhe fisheries, and to our rela tions with the British North American Pro vinces, the President says that he nas received nonce that the Imperial Parliament and the Dominion Government have passed 'aws to cirry the provisions of tbe treaty of Washing ton into operation, and he then, fore recom mends legislation by Congress in the same di rection. He speaks of the friendly relations of the United States with all tbe governments of Eu rope. Referring to the Vienna International Exposition, he recommends the fitting out ol two national vessels to convey tbe goods ol ex hibitors to Trieste, and suggests that a proposi tion be made to have the next great exposition in this country in 1876 at the time of the Ceo- tennial celebration in Philadelphia. He refers to the disturbed oondidon of Cuba, and says that do advance towards pacification iv that bland has been made. While the in surrection bad gained no advantages, and ex hibited no more ol the elements of power or of E respective sucaess than a year ago, neither ad Spain succeeded in repressing the insurrec tion. The parties to the strife were standing in the same attitude as for a long time past.— The cominuation of slavery in that island he regards as among the strongest causes of the continuation of the strife; and he thinks that the abolition of slavery and institution of other reforms there could not fail to advance the re storation of peace and order. It was greatly to be boped that the present liberal government of Spain will adopt that view. Referring to our relations with China and Japan, the President recommends previsions for maintaining four American youths in such of thos? countries as furm a part of the diplo matic family of ministers. He gives details of the revenue received in the past year, and of the reduction to the amount ot over one hun dred millions of the public debt. He expresses a doubt whether any further reduction in taxa tion is practicable for the present, and he re commends that no more legislation be bad on that suljectexcept to correct errors of omission ■ or commission in the present laws until suf ficient time shall have elapsed to prove that it can be done aod sbail leave sufficient revenue to meet current expenses, pay interest on the public debt and provi-Je lor the sinking fund He suggests, also, that tbe currency shall be as suon as possible brought to a par with gold. He says that various enter prises will be brouuht to the attention of Congress for the cheapening of the transportation of produoe from the West to the Atlantic sea coast, and suggests, that steps be taken to gain all the available information to ensure equitable aud judicious legi-latioo. In this connection he re fers favorably to the proposed route to connect the Miesixsippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charleston and Savannah by way ot tbe Ohio and Tennessee rivers ; also, to the propoced ex tension of the James River and Kanawha Canal and to tbe Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and to tbe proposed canal around Niagara Falls. He sa} a that there should be an almost con tinuous ty.»teui ot land-locked navigation from Maiue to the Gulf ot Mexico. Nature ioving ly provided a greater part of the route, aud tbe obstacles to be overcome being within the skill of engineers. He calls attention to the weakness of the American navy, and endorses tbe recommenda tions hi the Secretary of the navy in that res pect. He recommends subsidies to steamship lines to Brazil, and between San Franci-co," .New Z_a and and Austr alia Also au i_crease of the salaries ot heads of bureaus. lie lavors the abolition of the franking pri viltge, and recommends a modification of its existing evils. He also r commends the adop tion by Congress of the best niehod of acqutr iug title to ait telegraph lines now in operation, and of connecting that service wuh the postal service, it is nut probable that the Butject can secure proper consideration at tbts session, but be tbiuk. the movement'might be initiat ed, 60 that future action may be bad—fair to the government and to the private parties con cerned. fle calls attention to the alarming falling off in the American carrying trade, and says that the annual expenditure of $5,000 000 for the next five years would be a profitable invest ment. iieferring to ku-klux outrages, the President expressses his conviction that the tioie is not far distant when the obvious advantages ot good order and peace will induce an abandon ment of ail such combinations, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or in flict puuishment in order to protect citizens from the lawless doings of such combinations. He makes suggestions in regard to the In dians that t h_y shall all be confiued to the ter ritory south et Kansas, and that farms be se cured to them in tee and in severalty. He recommends that a further census be taken in 1875, but that no re-apportionment of members ot Congress be made under it. in only one of the Territories (Utah) is the conddioo of _ff_irs regarded by the President as unsatisfactory. It had seemed to be the policy of the Uiah Legislature to evade ail re sponsibility to the United State government, and even to hold a position hostile to it. He recommends a carelul revision of the present laws, and the enactment of laws that wili secure the perfect equality ot all ciuzens beforo the law aud the ultimate extinguishment of polyg amy. He favors action to give greater eclat and success to the observance of the Ceoteunial an niversary of American independence. in regard to the civil service, he says he will carry out the rules during his term of office, but suggests that there should be direct action of Congress to make tbe system binding on his successors, so as to secure to the public service a practical method of ob aining laiihful and ef ficient officers and employes. — .m. ■—_- Elegant—Rev.
