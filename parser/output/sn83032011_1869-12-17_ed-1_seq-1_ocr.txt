In coming btiforo you for tlio first tltno ns Chief MiijIstrnto or this Krcnl nation, it Is with Rrntltuilo to llio Giver of ail gooU for tho ninny benefits wo enjoy. Wo nro blessed with pcaco nt nomu, una wo uro without ciitanglinc; nllinnt'esitbroiul to forbotlo troubli'.wlth n territory unsurpassed in fertility, of nn nrea cqunl to tho abundant support of live Hundred millions of people, and abounding In every variety of useful inlnerala In quantity sufficient tonupply tho world for KcwrnUons, with nbun dant crops, with n variety of climate adapted to tho production of every hpecirs of earth's riches, nnd suited to tho habits, tastes and requirements of every living thine: with it population of -10,000,000 of.frec people; all speaking one lauguflgo, with facilities for every mortal to ncqulro an cdueatlon,wlth in stitutions closing to nono tho avenues or fame or any blessing of fortuno that mny bo coveted, with freedom of tho pulpit, tho prcsss nnd tho school, with a revenue flowing Into tho national treas ury beyond tho requirements of tho government. Happily, harmony is rapidly being restored within our own ooruirs. .uanuiaeiurcs Hitherto un known In our country are Bprlniring un in all sections, producing a degree of national independence uncqualcd by mat or any other power. These bless ings, and countless others, uro entrust ed to your caro and initio for safe-keen- ing for tho brief peiiod of our tenure of olllco. In a short tlmo wo must each of us return to thoranksof thopcople.who have conferred upon U3 our honors, and account to them for our stewardship. I earnestly dealro that neither you nor I may bo condemned by a free anil en lightened constituency, nor by our own coi.sclences. Emerging from a rebel lion of gigantic magnitude, aided as it was liy tno sympathies and assistance of nations witli which wo wore at peace, eleven States of tho Union were four years ago left without a legal Stato Government. Auatlonal debt had been contracted. American commerco was almobt driven from tho seas j tho indus try of one-half of tho country hud been taken from the control of the capitalist and placed, where nil labor rightfully belongs, in the keeping of tho laborer. The work ofrestoringStategovernmeuts loyal to the Union, or protecting and fostering free labor and providing means for paying tho interest on tho public debt has received ample atten tion from Congress. Although your ef forts havo not mot with tho success in all particulars that might have been do- sired, yet, on tho whole, they havo been more satisfactory than could havo been reasonably anticipated. Seven Stales which passed ordinan ces of becession havo been fully restored to their places lu.tho Union. Tho eighth (Georgia) held nn election, nt which sho ratilled;iicreoiPititutlo:i,Republicau in form, elected a Governor, members of Congress, a Stato Legislature and all other officers required. The Governor was duly Installed.nnd tho Legislature met and performed all the acts required of them byho recon struction acts of Congress. Subsequent ly, however, in violation of tho consti tution they had just ratified, ns since decided by tho Supremo Court of tho Stato, "they uuteaied the colored mem bers or the Legislature, nnd admitted to scats some members who arc disquali fied by tho third elauso or the Four teenth Amendment to thcConstitution, one article which they themselves had contributed to ratify." Under these cir cumstances, I would submit to you whether it would not bo wise, without delay, to enact n law authorizing tho Governor of Georgia to conveno tho membeHorlginally elected to the Legis lature, requiring eacli member to take tho oath prescribed by tho reconstruc tion acts, and none to bo admitted who nro Ineligible under tho third clause of tho pouriecntn Amendment. Tho freedmcn, under the projection which they havo received, nro making rapid progress in learning, nnd no com plaints nre heard of luck of Industry on their part when they receive fair remu neration for their labor. The menus provided for paying tho interest of the public debt, with allot tar expenses of tho Government, aro more than ample. Tho loss of our commerce is theonly result of tho Into rebellion which has not received sufficient atten tion from you. To. t(ils subject I call your earnest attention. I will not now suggest plans by which this object may bo cflectcd, but will, if necessary, make it tliu subject of a special messagedurlug tho session of Congress. At tho March term Congress by n Joint resolution tuithorlzwd llieKiecutlvo to order elec tions In tho Stales or Virginia, Missis sippi nud Texas, to submit to them tho Constitutions which each Inul previous ly lu conventions formed, uud submit tho Constitutions cither en tiro or in Beparnto parts, to bo voted upon nt tho discretion of tho Executive. Under tills nuthority elections wero called. In Virginia tho election took place on tho Cth of July, 1809. Tho Governor ami Lieutenant-Governor elected havo been Installed. The Legislature met and did all required by this resolution, nnd by all tho reconstruction nets of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful nuthor ity. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives, nud tho Stato, bo fully restored to her placo In tho family of States. Elections wero called In Mississippi nnd Texus, to commenco on tho ilOth of November, 1809, nnd to last for two days in Mlssls-dppl nnd four days In Texns. Tho elections havo taken place, but tho result is not known. It is to bo hoped that tho nets of tho legisla tures oftheso Stalin, when thoy meet, will ba such as to receive your appro val antl thus closo thu work of m-ou structlon. Among tho evils growing out of tho rebel llon,nud not yet referred fo, Is that of un Irredeemable currency. It is nn evil which I hopo will recclvo your most earnest attention. It is duty, mid ono uf tho hlghc.it duties of Government, to secure to tho citizens a medium of oxchnugo of fixed nnd un varying vnluo. This Implies n return to n specio basis, and no substltuto for It can bo dovisod. It should bo com mciictd now.and reached at tho earliest prnctleablo momont consistent with a fair regard to thu Interests of tho debtor chiss. Immediate resumption, if prac- tiauie.wouiu not bodeslrablo. It would compel the debtor class to pay boyond their contracts tho premium on gold nt tho dato of purchase, nnd would so bring bankruptcy and ruintotliousauds. Fluctuation, however, in tho paper vnl uo of thu measure of all vnlues, gold, Is detrimental to tho Interests of trade It mnkes the man of business nn involun tary gambler, for in nil sales, where fu ture payment is to bo mude, botii par tics speculato as to what will bo tho valuooftho currency to bo paid nnd received. 1 earnestly recommend to you then such leglslntion ns will Insuro n gradual return to specie payments and put an linmediato stop to fluctua tions In tho valuo of currency. Tho methods to secure tho former of theso results uro as numerous as nro tho spec ulators on political economy. Iseo but ono way, and that is to nutliorlzo tho treasury to redeem Its own naner nt n fixed prlco whenever presented, nnd to Witiiiioiel from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold naln for gold. Tho vast resources of tho nation, both developed nnd undeveloped, ought to mai:o our credit tho best on earth, with n Ies3 burden of taxation than tho citi zen has endured for six years past. Tho entiro public debt could bo paid in ten years, but it is not desirablo that tho peoplo should bo forced to pay it in that time. Year by year tho ability to pay increases in a rapid rate, but the burden of interest ought to be reduced ns rapidly as can bo dono without tho violation of contract. Tho public debt Is represented In great part by bonds having from flvo to twenty nnd from leu to forty years to run, bearing infer- est at the rnto of Bix per cent, nnd five per cent, respectively. It Is optional witli tho government to pay theso bonds at any period after tho expiration of tho least tlmo mentioned upon their face. The tlmo has already expired when n great part of them may be taken up, and is rapidly approaching when all may bo. It is believed that all which aro now duo may bo replaced by bonds bearing a rate of Interest not exceeding four and one-half per cent, and as rapid ly ns tho remainder beoomo duo that they may bo replaced in tho samo way. To accomplish this it mny bo necessary to authorize the interest to 1k paid at either of threoor four of tho money cen tres or Europe, or by nny Assistant Tjeasurer of tho United States, nt tho option ortho holders or tho bonds. I suggest this bubject ror tho considera tion or Congress j also simultaneously with this, tho propriety ol redeeming our currency, as beroro suggested, at itsmaiket value,atthe time the law goes Into effect, Increasing tho ruto at which currency will be bought nnd sold from day to day, or week to week, ut tho samo rnto of Intcrestiis tho Government pays upon its bonds. l'ho subject of (ho tariff nud internal taxation will necessarily receive your attention. Tho revenues of tho country aro greater than tho requirements, and may with snfety bo reduced; but as tho funding of the debt Inn four or a four nnd n half per cent loan wonld reduce tho annual current expenses largely, thus, arter funding, Justifying a greater reduction of taxation, this may bo re duced safely from sixty to eighty mill ions per annum at once, and may bo still further reduced from year to yenr ns tho resources of tho country nro de veloped. Tho report of tho Secretary or tho Treasury shows tho receipts of tho Government for tho fiscal year end ing Juno 30, 1600, to bo i!70,9I3,747,and tho expenditures, Including Interest, bounties, etc., to bo $321 ,100,597. Tho estimates for the ensuing year uro more favorable to tho Government, and will, no doubt, show n much larger decrease of tho public debt. Tho receipts in the Treasury beyond expcudituiesliave ex ceeded tho amount necessary to placo lo tho credit of tho Sinking Fund, as pro vided by law. To lock up tho surplus In tho Treasury, nnd withhold It from circulation would lend to such a con traction or tho currency as to cripple trade and seriously afTect tho prosperi ty ortho country. Uiidcrthesocircum- stances tho Secretary oj tho Treasury and myself heartily concurred In tho propriety of usi'ig all tho surplus cur rency in tho Treasury In tho purchaso or government' bonds, thus reducing tho Interest bearing Indebtedness or tho country, and or submitting to Congress tho question or llio disposition to be mado or tho bonds so purchased. Tho bonds now belt! by tho Treasury amount to about 75,O00,000, Including those buiougiui; to tho Sinking Fund. I recommend that tho wholo be placed to tho credit or tho Sinking Fund, Your attention is respectruily invited to tho recom mendatlons or theSecretnry or tho Treasury ror tho creation ortho oftlcoof Commissioner or Customs Revenue, ror tho Increase of salary to certain classes of officials aud tho substitution of in creased national bank circulation to re place tho outstanding threo per cent. certificates, nml most especially to his recommendation for tho repeal of laws ullowlng shares of Hues, penalties, for- feltuies, etc., to ufficcrs or tho Govern ment aud to Informers. Tho office of Commissioner of Internal Ruvcnuo Is ouo or tho most arduous nnd responsible under tho government, It rails but little, If uny, short or a Cabin et position In its imporlauco aud res ponsibilities. I would ask mr It, there fore, such legislation us lu your Judg ment will place tho oflUo upon a foot ing of dignity eonimennirato with its Importanco antl witli tho character nnd qunliticatiousof tho'class or men requir ed tu fill It properly. As thu United States Is tho freest of all nations, so, too, its peoplo sympa thizu with all peopled struggling for liberty and self-government. Hut while so sympathizing, It is duo to our honor that wo should abstain from enforcing our views upon unwilling nations, and from taking an Interested part, without invitation, in thoquarrois iriwcon dif ferent nations or between governments and their subjects. Our course should always bo in conformity with strict Jus tice aud law, International and local. Such has been tho policy of tho Admin iatratlon in dealing wllh thuso ques tions. For nioro than n year a valua ble) province of Spain, nndnncar neigh bor of ours, lu whom nil our peoplo cannot out icei a Ucep interest, hns been struggling for Independence and rroo- tlom. Tho people add government or mo united States entertain thu samo warm feelings and sympathies for tho people of Cuba in their iieudlmr strut?- glo that they manifested throughout tho previous struggles between Spain nnd her former colonies, in bchalfortho latter; but tho contest hus novcr assum ed n condition which amount?to n wnr In tho senso ot International law, or which would show the existence or a ittfaclo political organization of the lip surgents sufficient to Justify n recogni tion of belligerency. Tho prineiplo Is maintained, liowovor, that this nation is its own Judgo when to accord tho righfs orbclligorcncy.elther to a people struggling to freo themselves from a government they bcllovoto bo oppress ive, or to independent nations nt war with oach other. Tho United states have no disposition to Interfcro with tho existing relations or Spain to her colonial possessions on this continent. They beilovo that In duo time Spain and the European powers will find their interest in terminating theso relations and establishing their present denen- dencics independent powers, members ortho ramlly or nations. These depen dencies nro no longer regarded as subject to iransier rrom ono European power to another. When tho present relation or tho colonies ceases, they aro to becomo Independent powers, exercising tho right of choico and of seir-control in tho determination of their future condition nnd relations with other Towers. Tho United States, In order to putn ston to bloodshed in Cubaand In the Interest of a neighboring peoplo, proposed their good offices to bring thoexlsting contest to a termination. Tho offer not being accepted by Spain on n basis which wo believed could bo received by Cuba wa3 withdrawn. It is hoped that tho good ollicoa or tlio United Slates mav vet provo advantageous for tlio settlement of this unhappy strife. Mmnwhlle, 11 legal expeditious against Cuba havo been broken up. It has been tlio en deavor of tho Administration to execute tho neutrality laws in good faith, no matter how unpleasant tho tnsk, made so by tho sufferings we havo endured from lack of liko good faith towards us by other nations. On tho 20th of March last tho U. S. fcchooner Llzzio Major was arrested on tho high seas by a Spanish rrlgato and two passengers taken from it and carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representations or theso racts wero mado to tlio Spanish Government us soon as official information of them reached Washington. Tho two pnssen gers wero set nt liberty, und the Spanish Government n-sured tho United States that tho captain of tho frigate in mak ing tho capture hud nctcd without law; that ho had been reprimanded for tho irregularity of ids conduct, und that tho Spanish authorities In Cuba would not sanction any act that would violate tho rights or treat witli disrespect the sovereignty of this nation. Tlio question of the seizuro of tho brig Mary Lowell nt ono of tho Bahama Islands by the Spanish authorities in now tho subject of correspondence be tween tills government and those of Spain and Great Britain. Tho Cnptuln Geueral of Cuba, about May Just issued n proclamation authorizing search to bo mado of vessels on tho high seas. Immediate remonstraiico was made against this, whereupon the Captniu General Issued n new proclamation, limiting the right of search to vessels of tho United States, bo far as author ized under the treaty of 1795. This proclamation, howevcr.was immediate ly withdrawn. I iiao always felt that tho most Intimate relations should be cultivated between tho Republic of tho United Siates and nil independent na tions on this continent. It may bo well worth considering whether new treaties between tho United States aud them may not bo profitably entered into to secure moro intlmato relations, friendly, commercial or otherwise. Tlio subject of an Inter oceanic canal, to connect tho Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through tho Isthmus or Darleii, is ono In which commerce Is greatly Interested. Instructions havo been given to our Minister to tho Republic of the United Stales of Colombia to' endeavor to ob tain nuthority for u survey by this Government In order to detennlno tho practicability of such nu undertaking, and it charter for tho right of way to build, by prlvato enterprise, such a work, if tho survey proves it to be practicable. In order to comply with tho agreement of tho United States ns to n mixed commission ut Lima ror the adjustment claims, it becamo necessary to send n Commissioner and Secretary to Lima in August last. No appropria tion having been mado by Congress for (Ids- purpose, It Is now uskod that out do mndo covering tho past and future expenses of tho commission.

Tho conduct of tho war between the allies nnd tho Republic of Paraguay has mndo the intercourse with that country so difficult that it has oeen uecmeti ituvlsablo to wIHnlmee- our represcntativo from her. Towards thO ClOSO ortllO Inst Allmlnlalrnllnn n convention was signed ut London for moseuiementornll outstanding claims between Qreat Britain and tbn TTnltwi States, which failed to rtcelvo tho ad- vfco and consent of tho Senoto to its rat ification.

Great oven us is that difference, not n word was found In tho treaty, and not an inference could bo drawn from It. to remove tho smisn nf tho unrriendliuess or tho courso or Great Britain In our strugglo ror existence which had so decnlv nnd universally impressed iUeli upon the people or this couniry. ueiicving that a convention thus misconceived In its scope aud inn dequuto In Its provisions would not havo produced tho hearty, cordial set tlement oi pending questions which nlono is consistent witli tho relations which I desire to have cstnhlfihrvl lw- tween tho United Statesaud Great Brit nin. I regarded tlio notion nf Din Ron. atoin rejecting tho treaty to havo been wisely taken, in tho Interest or peace, anu as n necessary step .In tho direction or a perfect and cordial friendship bo- tween mo two countries. A sen.seitlv people conscious of their power, are more ni cuso under a great wrong whol ly unatoncd. than under tbn restraint of it settlement which satisfies neither their ideas of justico nor their senso of tho grievnuco they hove sus tained. Tho rejection of tho tre.ttv won followed by it stato of public feeling on botn sid03 which I thought not favora blo to nn immediate nttcmntnt renow. ed nefrotiations. 1 necordintrlv sn in. structed tho Minister or tho United States to Great Britain, and found that my views in this regard wcroshared by her Majesty's Minister. I lmno that tim tlmo may soon nrrlvo when tho two Governments can nnnroach the solution or this momentous question with an ap preciation or what is duo to tho rights, dignity and nonor oreacfi.and with tho determination not only to removo tho causes or complaint In tho past, but to lay the foundation of n broad principle or public law which will prevent future, difficulties nud lend a llrm and contin ual peaeo and friendship. This is now tho only grnvo question which tho United States hnvo with nny foreign nation. Tlio question of renewing a treaty ror reciprocal trado between tlio United States and tho British provinces on tills continent lias not been ravorably considered by tlio Administration, Tho advantages or such a treaty would be wholly In mvor or tho British prov inces except possibly n row engaged In the trade between tlio two sections, No citizen of the United States would bo benefited by reciprocity. Our inter nal taxation would provo a protection to tho British producer almost equal to tho protection which our manufacturers now receive from tlio tariff. Some ur- range mcnts, however for the reg ulation of commercial intercourse be tween tho United States and tlio Do minion of Canada may bo desirable. The commission for adjusting tho claims of tho Hudson Bay and Fugct's bound Agricultural Company upon the United States has terminated Its la bors. Tho award ol $050,000 has been made.and all tho rights and titles of tho Company on tho territory of thu United States have been extinguished. Deeds for tho property or tho company have been-dellvered. An appropriation by Congress to meet this sum Is usked. Tho commissioners ror determining tho Northwestern land boundary be tween thu United States and thoBrltlsh possessions, uudor tho treaty or 1850, have completed their labors and the commission has beeu dissolved. In conformity with the recommenda tion or Congress a proposition wasearly mado to tho British Government to abolish the mixed courts created under tho treaty or April 1, 1602, ror tho blip presslou or the sluvo trade. Tho sub ject Is still under negotiation. It hav ing como to my knowledgo that a cor porate company organized under tho BiltUh law proposed to laud upou tlio shores or tho United States and to opo rato tlicro a sub-marlno cablo under a concession from his Malesty, the Em poror of tho Frcuch, of an exclusivo right for twenty yeurs of communica tion between the bhorcs of Franco sad tho Uulted States, with tke very ob jectionable featuro of subjecting all messages conveyed thereby to tho scru tiny and control or tho French govern ment, I caused tho French and British legations ut Washington to be mudo ac quainted with tho probablo policy of uongrcss on tho subject, ns foreshadow ed by tlio bill which passed tho Senate m March last. This drow from tho representatives of tlio Company an -. agreement lo nccept as tho basis of their operations tlio provisions or that bill, or or such other enactment on tho subject ns might bo passed during tho npproachlng session or Congress j nlso to uso their influence to secure from the French Government n modification or their concession so as lo permit the lauding upon Frencli Boll or any cablo belonging to nny company incorpor ated by the authorities or tho United States, or of nny State In tho Union. nnd on their part not to opposo tho es tablishment or any such cable. In con sideration or this agreement, I directed tno withdrawal of all opposition by tho umieu states authorities to tho Inudlnir of tho cablo nnd to tho working of U until tho mooting of Congress. I regret to say that thcro has been no modifica tion mado In tlio company's concession, nor so far as I can learn havo thoy at tempted to Hecuro ono. Their conces sion oxcludes tho capital nnd tlio citi zens of tho United States from compe- tiiion upon tno shores of Franco. I recommend legislation to protect tho rights of citizens of tho United States. as well as tho dignity und sovereignty of tho nation against such nu nssurap- lion, i shall nlso endeavor to sccuro by negotiation an abandonment of the principle of monopolies in ocean tele graphic cables. Copies of tills corres pondence aro herewith furnished. The unsettled political condition of other countries less fortunato than our own, sometimes Induces their citizens to como to the United States ror tho solo purpose or becoming naturalized. Hav ing secured this, they return to their nntivo country and reside, without dis closing their chango of allegiance. They accept official positions of trust or hon or which can only bo held by citizens of their nativo land. They Journoy under passports describing them us such citizens, nnd it Is only when civil dis cord, nrtcr, perhaps, years or quiet, threatens their persons or their proper ty, or when their native Stato drafts them into its military service, that tho ract of their chungo of allegiance is mado known. They reside permanently away from thu United States, and they cuulributo nothing to its rovenuos ; they avoid tho duties or Its citizenship, and tliuy only muko themselves known by a claim of protection. I have directed tho diplo matic and consular officers or the Unit ed States to scrutinize carefully all such claims of protection. Tho citizen of tho United States, whether native or adopted, who dis charges his duty to his country, is on titled to its couiplcto protection. While I havo a volco In tho direction or affairs I shall not consent to imperil this sacred right by conferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants. On tho accession of tho present Administration it was found that the Minister for North Gor many mado propositions for tlio nego tiation of n Convention for tlio protec tion of emigrant passengers,to which no responso had beeugivcn.lt was conclud ed that to bo effectual all tho maritimo powers engaged In the trado should Join in such a measure. Invitations havo boen extended to tho Cabinets of Lon don, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels, Tho Haguo,Copenhagen and Stockholm to empower their Representatives at Washington to simultaneously cuter into negotiations, and to concludo with tho United States conventions Identical in form, making uniform regulations as to the construction of the parts of vessels to bo devoted to tho uso of emi grant passengers, as to the quantity of food, ns to the medical treatment of the sick, nnd ns to the rules to bo observed during tho voyage, in order to becuro ventilation, to promoto health, to pre vent Intrusion, and to protect tlio fami lies, and providing for tho establish ment of tribunals in tho several coun tries for enforclug such regulations by summary process' And your attention Is respectruily called to tho law regulat ing tho tariff on Russian hemp, and to tho question whether to fix tho charges on Russian hemp higher than they are fixed upon munllla is not a violation of our treaty with Russia placing her pro ducts upon the same rooting with those or tlio most ravored nations. Our manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under tho encour agement which they now recclvo. With the Improvements in machinery already effected and still increasing, causing machinery to tnko the placo of skilled labor to a largo extent, our lm- ports of many urticles must fall off largely within a very row years. Fortuuately, manufactures aro not con ilncd to a row localities as formerly, and It Is to bo hoped will becomo moro and moro diffused, making tlio interest in them equal In all sections. They givo employment and support to hundreds of thousands of people at home, and retain with us tho means which other wiso would bo shipped abroad. llio extension or railroads In Europe und tho East Is bringing into competi tion with our agricultural products like products of other countries. Sclf-iutcr- est, If not self-preservation, therefore, dictates caution ogalnst disturbing nny Industrial interest of the country. It tenches us also tho necessity of looking to other markets for tho salo of our sur plus. Our neighbors soutii of us, and China nnd Japan, should receive our special attention.
