"When anything goes wrong with the kaiser's plans he turns in and lielcs Belgium sonic more and when there's a blowout in the old Democratic party MarsoJIeury, -figuratively speaking, kicks the stuffin' outen one W. J. Bryan. In Mr. AVatterson's latest ho says of the millionaire commoner of Lin coln : - - "That Mr. Bryan is a man o judgment, char acteristically infirm, we arc bound to believe for the reason that he has shown it alike in his poli tical vaticinations and his personal dealings. But in matters relating solely to Ins own intcrst, he has been circumspect, to a degree; albeit, at the same time regardless of other interests. He especially understands the show-business. Tims, without the least concern where, or whom, it hits, he rushes to the front now with National Prohibition and Wo man Suffrage as paramount issues. His pretext is as always, the. Democratic party. But that is transparently absurd. The real and obvious rea son is that they insure him certain chautauqua en gagements and paying audilmccs. "Even the grape juice incident was thrift, wine being the most expensive item in diplomatic enter tainments, and, then having cut one-third oft' the cost of his living, he coolly claims that $12,000 a year is still insufficient for his support, and pro ceeds to double, or tveble it by the most flagrant neglect of official duties, the stipend for which he knew when he accepted office. "None of these delinquencies shocking delin quenciescan be explained on the "Worhf's hypoth esis of 'noble ideals' of any kind of service, na tional or international. As a common, every-day observation they show Mr. Bryan a self-seeking man, after everything in sight and out of sight, the money-bug alternating with the office-bee, in warping his sense of propriety and obscuring his valuation of the great place given him to keep him out of mischief and to bring him into some kind of proportion to that Democratic party which he pretends to hold so dear." DEMOCRATS ALARMED. A "Washington dispatch to the New York Sun says that administration leaders are greatly con cerned about the revenue, and fear that they may be compelled to revise tup taxation laws before the next Presidential election. They have new cause for alarmjn the fact that in May, 1910, sugar will go on the free list. Sugar is the largest single item of revenue. Under Republican tariffs it yielded nearly $60,000,000 a year. The Democratic tariff provided for a sliding scale of reduction on the product, with the stipulation that it should go on the free list in 191 G. Furthermore, the yield from the income tax this year is likely to fall off mater ially because of the hard times. There is, therefore, talk among some Democrats about restoring the sugar duty. A serious effort will also be madevto keep down appropriations, but without much pros pect of success. THFsTl55NrT LISTEN RIGHT. In President Wilson recent message to Com gress he opened with thisIoijr-flush sentence: . "Gontlomen of the Congress, iho sossion upon which you nro now ontorlng will bo tho closing session of tho Sixty third Congress, a Congress, I venture to say, whioh wilJ long be rcnicmborcd for tho great bo.ly of thoughtful and constructive work which it has tlono, ft loyal response to tho thought and needs of tho country. I should like in this nddress to review tho notablo record and try to make ndoqunto-assessment of it; bat no doubt, wo stand too near tho work that has been dono and nro ourselves too much part of it to play tho rolo of historians toward it." And further along he makes tlfo following ad mission and begs Congress to right the wrong it has done by saying: "I havo como to ask'ym to romedy and correct these mis takes and omissions, oven nt this short session of a Con gress whioh would certainly scorn to havo dono nil the work that could reasonably bo expected of it. Tho timo mid tho circumstances nro extraordinary, and so must our ef forts bo also." Surely the schoolmaster forgot himself for a season. If "the Congress' made such a "notable record," why should it have any mistakes to cor rect 1 Probably Mr. Bryan is one of the mistakes the President is apologizing for. HOW IT 

DON'T WORK. Wo find in the Boston Advertiser some instruc tive figures concerning government ownership of railroads in Kussia. There are 13,000 miles of pri vate lines and 28,000 miles of public lines. The rates on both government and private roads are high and the wages low. An employee's wage for one dav in Russia will purchase 10 miles third class travel; in America an employee's wage for one day will purchase 12 1-2 miles first class travel. Yet tho cost of operation on the government lines con sumes 70 per cent of tho gross revenue; on the pri vate lines 59 per cent. The government roads em ploy 20:i men for every 10 miles of track, while the private lines employ only 169 men for the same nuinlfer of miles and handling a larger traffic.

To an active external commerce the protection of a naval force 3s indispensable. This is manifest with regard to wars in which a state is itself a party. But besides this, it is our experience' that the most sincere neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of nations at' war. IV secure respect to a neutral flag requires a' naval force organized and ready to vindicate it from insult .or aggression. This may even prevent the - necessity of going to war by discouaging belligerent-powers from committing such violations of the rights of the neutral party as may, first or last, leave no other option.

The death of Joseph Smith, head of the roorganied Church of tho Latter nificancc, since this branch of tho Mor r.ifieance, since this brnnoh o ftho Mor nion church is free from tho taint of polygamy and is a society of laborious, orderly nnd law-abiding citizens. As the father of tho man who hat just died was tho founder of tho ori ginal church, tho "finder" or author of tho famous "Hook of Mormons," his branch is in a scnso tho main division of tho sect; but as Hrighnm Young, who quarreled with him, was tho stronger character of tho two and had tho ad vantage of being able to offer tho car pal doctrine of polygamy as a part of the "rovoaled" religion, ho won the most followers. Tho Missouri "Saints," however, will probably continue ccist- ence under a new head, as many another small religious body is able to do. A shorthand reporter lias been at Smith's bedside for several weeks and thero will likely bo no doubt as to his "last words." It is not unlikely that a new "revelation" will be disclosed lit si feature of his final utterances. A year or bo ago a phonographic sermon, prepared in advance by a deceased Michigan citizen, was made a part of his funeral ceremonies, the assembled mourners being startled by the voice of tho man they had come to bury.
