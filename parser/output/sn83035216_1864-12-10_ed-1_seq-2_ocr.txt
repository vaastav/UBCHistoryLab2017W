Tba hrcpoeed Overland Teloerapb between Aarerlca and Europe, by the war of Bchrina; oralis ana Atmiio xlursia which was sane tiontd by Congress at tba last tension, bat been undertaken under very favorable circum stances by an association of American eitiaent wiin tbe cordial good will and support, aa well of tbie Government at those of Great Britain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of tba Soath American Sutee of their high appreciation of the enterprise, aod their readiness to eo-operate in constructing lines tributary 10 that world eucirciing com momcation. I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphio communication be tween the eastern coast of America and Great Britain haa been renewed with a full rrpecta lion or Its early accomplishment, lhuii It hoped that with tbe return of domestic peace, the coaotry will oe aoie to resume tub vnergy aod advantage ner former bign career cf coin EGTIT.

Tbe evil was promptly corrected on tbe arrival of tbe surcersor in tbe consulate, aud our relations with Egypt as well as our re lations with the barbary Powers, are eutirely satisfactory. CHINA. Tbe rebellion wbich hat to hng bean fla grant in China, hat at latt been suppressed, with tbe co-operating good offices af this Gov ernment and of the otber Western Commercial Power. Tbe judicial consular establishment bas become very diffiealt aud onerous, aod it ill need legislative action to adapt it to the extension of our commerce, aod ta tbe more intimato intercourse which baa been instituted with tha government and people of that rati Empire. China seems lo be accepting, with hearty good will, tbe conventional laws wbich regulate commerce and social intercourse among the Western nations. JAPAN. Owing to tba peculiar situation of Japan and tbe anomalous form of its government, tha action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations is Inconstant and capricious. Nev ertheless, good progress has been t fleeted by tba Western Powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecnuiary claims have been allowed or pnt in course of settlement, and tbe Inland Sea h.o been re-opened to commerce. There it reason also to believe that these pro ceedings have increased rather than diminished tbe friendship of Japan toward tbe United States. BL CKADE RAI ED. The port of IV oi folk, Fernandina and Feniacula, have been opened by Proclama tion. It is Loped tbat Foreign merchants will now consider whether it is or not safer aod more profitable to lbeme!ve, as well as just 10 the United Slates, lo rcort to these and other open ports, than it is to pursue through many hazards and at rest cost, a contraband trade wt'h other ports which are elo-ed, if not by actual military rperations, at lenst by a lawful and eff.c tive blockade. THE SLAVE TRADE. For myself I have no doubt of the pow er and duty of tbe Executive, ander the law of nations to exclude enemies of the boman race from an aylum in the United S ates. If congress should thiuk the pro ceedings in such cases lack the ' anthoaitv oi law, or ooght to be further repndiited by it, I rccommed that provisions be nude tffectaally preventing; foreign slsre traders from arquiriog domicile and facilities for tbeir criminal occupation in onr country. It is possible that if it were a new and open question, the maritime powers with the light they now ei joy they would not aoncede the privileges of a naval belliger. ent to the insurgents of the Uui ed S ate, destiinie at tbey are, and always have been rqnally of ships and of ports and harbors Difloyal emissaries bave been nei'her les a6sidu( us uor more successful during the last rear than tbey were before that time, in their efforts, ondcr favor of that privil ege, to emuro:! our country 10 foreign wars. He desne and determine ion of the maritime States to defeat tbat design, are believed to be aa sincere, and cannot be mo e earnest than E irope. Kevertbeless, unfbrsecn poli'icil d'ffi :ulties have arisen, and partially in B az;lliau and BiiiUli pons, and on tbe Northern boundaries of tbe United S'etes, abicb bare require) are likely lo coutiuue to require, the prac tice of conitsDl vigilance aud a l ist and conciliatory spirit on tbo part of the Unit ed ti!e, as will at lue uaiiout concerned and their governments. Commissioners have been appoiu'.ed un der the treaty w'un Great B iiaio, rn tbe adjustment of tba claims of the Hudson IJjy and Pgeta Sound Agricultural Cora pauies in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution or tbe task assigned to lbm PR TECTI N OF OUR CANADIAN B RDER. Iu view of- tba iusecurity of life in tho region adjacent lo tbe Canadian border, by tne assaults ana aepreoatioos commilt. ed by inimical aod desperate, persons who are harbored there, it bas been thought proper to give notice that, after the expira tion of six months, (the period condition ally s'ipulated in the existing arrangements with Great B. itain), the United States must bold thtmeelvei at liberty to iucrease their naval armament opou the lakea, if tbey ahall Cud tbat proctcdiug necessary 'Ihi condition of the border will necessarily com iuto consideration to eonuecUoo with tha question of continuing or modifying tbs rights of transit, from Canada though th Uuited Stairs, as well a tbe regula tions of import which were temporarily established by tba Reciprocity Treaty of the 5th of J one, 1854. J desire, however, to ba oodei stood, while making ibis state ment, that tba Colonial authorities are not deemed to be intcalioaally unjust or no friendly toward the United States, bot on tba. contrary, there is every reason to ex peel that, with tbe approval of tbe Imper ial Government, they will take tbo necess ary measures to preveut new incursions across the border. FOREIGN IMMIGRATION. Tbe aet passed at t he last session for tba encouragement of immigration bas, as far as was possible, been put into operalioo. It eoems to nerd an amendment which will enable tbe officer of tbe government to prevent tbe practice of frauds against tbe immigrants wbile on their way a ad on tbeir rrlal U the ports, ao as to eecare to them here free choice of avocation and place oifettlement.

FINANCES. Tbe flnsprial affairs of the Government have been tarcctsfnlly administered during the past year. Tba legislation ol tbe la&t srutoo of Congress has beneficially affect ed tbo revenue, although sufficient time hat not yet elapsed lo experience the full effect of tie viral cf tbe provision of tht Acts of Congress imposing increased ttxa lion. The receipts during the year from all tonrces, npon tbe baia of warrants sign ed by the Socre'ary of the Treasury, in eluding the loans tud tho balance in the Treasury on the first day of July, e'ghtren hnndred and slxiy-three were $i,3U4,798, 007.62, and the ggregte disbursements upon tbe same basis, were $ 1,293,056, 101 -89, leaving a balance in ti e Treasury, a .hown by- warrants,, of $93,739,905.73.

For the avtual receipt! and diiburse mentt for the II it q-iarter and the ertimat ed receipt and disbursements for the three remaining- qnarters of the current fiscul year and the general operations of tbe Treeiu'y in detail, I refer you to the re poit of the Secretary of (he Treasury; I concur with hira in tho opini-o that tbe proportion of tbe monies required to meet the exjeosis consequent upon the war derived from taxation, should be still further increased, and 1 eariietly invite yonr attention to Ibis snhj-xt, to the end tbat therefmiy be such additional Legisla tion as shall be nqnirod to meet tbe jtst expt'dions of tbe Secre'ary. P PULAR LOANS. Ti e pnblic debt on the first day i.f July last, as appears by tbe books of tho T eas : nry, amouuted to one billion, seven linn dred and forty thousand million, six bun dred and oine'y thousand, four hundred and eighty nine dollars and forty nine cents Probably should the war coniinue for another year, that amount may be iticreas ed, by not fur from five hnndred milliocs. Held as it is fur the most part by our own people, it has become a rubstan'iul branch of national, though private properly. For obvious reason, the more nearly thit prop erty can be distributed among all tho pen pie the better; to favor, such general distri bution, greater iLducements to become owners, might perhap, with good effect and without irqury, I e presented to person of Tmilcd ire a tiii. With this view I sug gest Buc'.ucr it mtglii not- be kotb expedv ent and rcmpettul for Cong ess to provide, that a limited amount of some future issue o' public securities niiirht be held by any bona fiVe pn'rhafe, exempt from taxa oi aud from sc x ire fjr debt, under such re strictMos and limitations as m'abt le necessary to guard agm'nsi the abuse cl so mportaot a privilege. Ibis would enable p: udent personv to set aside a small annuity Hgaiust a poUible dtiy of want. Privileges like these would reudcr the possession of such s. curitics- to the amount imitcd, most desirable to persons of small means, who m'ght te able to savo enough for the pnrpose. The greak adanioge of cinzrns beiuir creditor as well a debtors. h relation to the public dubt is obvious. Meu rendily perceive that tbey cannot be much oppressed by n debt which they owe lo themselves. lite pnViic debt on the first day of July lust, although somewhat xcceding tbe es nnate of the Secretary of tbe Treasury, m-ide to Congress at the commencement of tbe last session, fell short of the estimate of that offijer, mado in the preceding December, as to itsproba bla amount at ibe beginning of this year, by the sum of $3,995,079 33. This tact xbibitt a setitfaciory condition and con duct of tbe operations of ibe Tieusury. i of NATIONAL BANKS. Tht. National Banking sjrs'em Is prov- ng to be acceptable to cupi'alist and to th" people. On the 15 h of November fire hundred aud eighty four National Banks hud been organized, a cocsiderable number of whic. weie conversions from S ate Bjuks. Changes from tbe S ate system to the Nations! system, are rapidly taking plice, and it is hoped, Ir.a'. very soon, there will be in the Uni'ed States, no bank of issue not unauthorized by Con gress, and no bank note circulation not secured by the Government. That the Government and the people will derive geje al beuefit f.om tb ichene in tbe banking sjsttrj, can scarclj be question J n-L VT ... eu. tui n a' ion I system win creates reliable aod permanent infl ience in sup- t .1 it . T .1 . . pors of ma national credit, and protect toe peopie against losses in tbe ose of pa per money. Whether or not, aoy farther legislation la advisable for the suppression of state mux issues, it will be for Con groi to determin. It seems quite clear tbat tba treasury cannot be satisfactorily conducted onless the Government can ex ercise a restraining power over the bauk not circulation of the country. MILITARY AFFAIRS. The report of the secretary of War, and the accompanying documents, will de tail tbe campaign of Ibe armies in tbe field since lb date of tbe last Annual Message; and' also the operations of tbe several administrative bureau of the War Department, daring tbe last year.

GROWTH OF THE NATION. It is of noteworthy iutetest l but tho steady expansion of population, improvement and goverounentul institntious over the new and unoccupied portious -of onr country, have scarcely been impeded, much less checked or destroyed by our great civil war which at the first glance would seem to have ab sort ed almost the entire euerg'es of the nation. TERRITORIES. The orgm'zvtion aud admission of the State of Nevada has been completed in conform ty with the law, and thus our ix- cedent system is firmly established in the mountains which once scene! a barren and uninhabitable waste botween the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on me coast or the PaciQu (Joeau. fit. .

It Is' peculiarly the peoples' department. In which they feel more directly concerned than in any other. I commend it to the costinned alteution and fostering cere of Congress. THE WAR AND 

SHERMAN'S MOVEMENT. war Anna el Messsgn. All the important lines and posi tions then occupied ry our forces bao been tnaitiiaina, and onr armies have steadily ad vanced, thus (''iterating the negroes It-It in tbe rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States, bare again produced rensjnably fair crops. ) The most remarkable feature In the military operations of the year is General Sherman's at tempted march of three hundred miles directly through the enemy's region. It tends to show a great increaso of our relative strength that our Ueiieral-iu-Cbief should feel able to con front aud bold io check every active force of the enemy and yet to detach a well-appointed large army to move on sucn an expedition. Tha result not jet being known, conjecture in regard to It Is not here tnauigea in. Important movements bave also occurred doring the year to the effect of moulding soci- oty for durability in the Union. Although short of complete tnceess, it is much in tbe right direction, that 12 000 cllircns in each of the Slates of Arkausts and Louisiana, have organized loyal State Governments with free Constitutions, and are .earnestly struggling to maintain and administer tbem. 1 be move ment in the same direction, more extensive, though less definite, in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, should not be overlooked. . Bot Maryland presents tba example of complete success. Maryland is secure -to liberty and union for all tbe future. Tbe genius of rebel lion will no mora claim Narrlaud. L:ke an other foul spirit, it may aeuk to lesr her, bwt it will woo ber no more, THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. Congress, a amendment of tbe Constitution, abolishing slavery tiiroaghout tbe U. a., pusncd tbe ceo ate, but failed, for lack of tha requisite Iwo thirds vote, in the House of Representatives. Although tbe present is tbe same Congress, and nearly the same members, without ques tioning the wisdom and patriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recom mend the reconsideration and passage of tbe measure at tbe present session. Of coarse, the abstract question is not changed, but an inter vening election shows almost certainly that the next Congress will para the measure if this docs not. Hence, there is ouly a question of time as to when tbe proposed amendment will g to tbe Slates for tbeir action ; and as it is to so go. at all events, may ire uot agree tbat tbe sooucr the better T It is rot claimed that the election has imposod a duty on members to change tbeir views or tbeir votes any further than as an additional element to be considered Tbeir judgmonl may be effected by it. It is tbe voice of the people, now for the first time heard upon the questioo. In a great National crisis like ours unanimity cf action among those seeking a common end, is very desirable almost indiapecsuble aud yet no approach to such unanimity Is attainable an loss some deference shall be paid to te will of the ma jority, simply because it is the will of the ma jority. In this ease the common end's tbo muKitninwg of tbe Uuion, and among tbe men is lo secure tbat eud, such will, through the election, is most clearly declared io furor of such constitutional auieudmeut.
