The Man Prom Brodneys By GEORGE BARR MCITCHEON Copyright, 1908, by Dodd, Msad « Co. "Ah, the' flcklefy of' women!" he sighed. "There's a new word for you, Selim—ficklety." It was far past midday when he heard from Rasula. He had seen the princess but once, and then she was walking briskly, wrapped In a rain coat, followed by ber shivering dogs and ber two Rapp-Thorberg soldiers. Sonjehow she failed to see Chase as he sauntered hungrily, almost implor ingly, across the upper terrace, In plain view. Perhaps, after all, it was not the weather. Rasula's messenger came to the gates and announced that he had a letter for Mr. Chase. Rasula had this to say: We have reason to suspect that you were right In your suspicions. The gold en plate has been found this day in the cave below the chateau, Just as you have said. This much of what you have charged against Jacob yon Blitz seems to be borne out by the evidence secured. Last night there was an attempt to rob the vaults in the company's bank. Again I followed your advice and laid a trap for the men engaged. They were slain in the struggle which followed. I have to in form you, sir, that your charge against Jacob von Blitz does not hold good in the case of the bank robbery. Therefore I am impelled to believe that you may have unjustly accused him of being im plicated in the robbery of the treasure chests. He was not among the bank thieves. There were but three of them— the Boer foremen. Jacob von Blitz came up himself and joined us in the fight against the traitors. He was merciless in his anger against them. Tou have said that you will testify against him. Sir, 1 have taken it upon myself to place him under restraint notwithstanding his ac tions against the Boers. He shall have a fair trial. If It is proved that he Is guilty, he shall pay the penalty. We are just people. Sir, we, the people of Japat. will take you at your word. We ask you to appear against the prisoner and give evidence In support of your charge. He shall be placed on trial tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. On my honor as a man and a believer I assure safety to you while you are among us on that occasion. I, Ra sula, will meet you at the gates and will conduct you back to them in safety. If you are a true man, you will not evade the call. RASULA. "Weil, it looks as though Von Blitz has spiked your guns," said Depping ham. "The dog turns against his con federates and saves his own skin by killing them." "In nny event," said Browne, "you spoiled his little game. He loses the treasure, and he didn't get into the vaults. Rasula should take those points into consideration." "He won't forget them, rest assured. That's why I'm sure that he'll take my word at the trial as against that of Von Blitz," said Chase. ■ "You—you don't mean to say, Mr. Chase, that you are going into the town?" cried Lady Agnes, wide eyed. "Certainly, Lady Deppingbam. They are expecting me." • "Don't be foolhardy, Chase. They will kill you like a rat!" exclaimed Depplngham. "Oh, no, they won't" said the other confidently. "They've given their prom ise through Rasula. Whatever else they may be, they hold a promise sa cred. They know I'll come. If I don't they'll know that I urn a coward. You wouldn't have them think 1 am a cow ard, would you. Lady Depplngham?" The next morning he coolly set forth for the gates, scarcely thinking enough of the adventure to warrant the mat ter of fact goodbye that be bestowed upon those who were congregated to see him off. His heart was sore as he strode rapidly down the drive. Ge nevra had not come down to say fare well. "By heaven," he muttered, strangely vexed with her, "I fancy she means 1L She's bent on showing me my place. But she might have come down and wished me good luck. That was little enough for her to do. Ah, well!" he sighed, putting it away from him. As he turned into the tree lined ave nue near the gate a slender young wo man lu a green and white gown arose from a seat In the shade and stepped a pace forward, opening her parasol quite leisurely as he quickened his steps. Her eyes gleamed brightly, and she was breathing as one who has run swiftly. "You are determined to go down there among those men?" she demand | ed, the smile suddenly giving way to a look of disapproval. She ignored his hand. "Certainly," he said after the mo ment of bewilderment. "'Why not? I ! —I thought you bad made up your ' mind to let me go without a—a word for good luck," She found great diffl I culty In meeting the wistful look in his ' eyes. ."You ar e go od t o_com e down fiére to say goodby. Wë'ré almost strangers again." "I did not come down to say goodby," she said, her lips trembling ever so slightly. "I don't understand," he said. "I am going with you into the town— as a witness," she said, and her face went pale at the thought of It. "Genevra," he cried, "you—you would do that?" "Why not, Mr. Chase?" She tried to speak calmly, but she was trembling. After all, she was a slender, helpless girl—not an amazon! "I saw and heard everything. They won't believe you unsupported. They won't harm me. If I swear to them that what you say is true they"— Her hand was on his arm now, trem bling, eager, yet charged with fear at the prospect ahead of her. He clasped the little band in bis and quickly lifted it to his lips. "I'm happy again!" he cried. "It's all right with me now." She withdrew her hand on the instant "No, no! It isn't that," she said, her eyes narrowing. "Don't misinterpret my coming here to say that I will go. It isn't because—no. it isn't that!" "I was unhappy because you had for saken me," he said gently. "You are brave—you are wonderful! But I can't take you down there. I know what will happen if they find him guilty. Goodby, dear one. I'll come back— aurely I'll come back. Thank you for sending me away happy." "Won't you let me go with you?" she asked after a long, penetrating look into bis eyes. "I would not take you among them for all the world. Yon forget Neither of us would come back." "Neither of us?" she said slowly. "I wouldn't come back without you," he said quietly, earnestly. She under stood. "Goodby! Don't worry about me. I am In no danger." "Goodby," she said, the princess once more. "I shall pray for you with all my soul." She gave him her hand. It was cold and lifeless. He pressed it warmly and went quickly away, leav ing' her standing there in the still shade of the satinwoods. looking after him with eyes that grew wider and wider with the tears that welled up from behind. Hours went by—slow, tortuous hours in which the souls of those who watched and waited for his return were tried to the utmost. Once there came to the ears of the watchers on the mountain side the sound of distant shouts, later the brief rattle of firearms. The blood of every one turned cold with apprehension. Every voice was stilled, every eye wide with dread. Neenah screamed as she fled across the terrace toward the drawbridge, where Selim stood as mo tionless at a statue. Luncheon time passed, and again, as if drawn by a magnet, the entire household made Its way to the front of the chateau. At last Selim uttered a shout of joy. He forgot the deference due bis bet ters and unceremoniously dashed off toward the gates, followed by Neenah, who seemed possessed of wings. Chase was returning! They saw him coming up the drive, his hat in bis band, bis white umbrella raised above bla head. The eager, Joy ous watchers saw him greet Selim and his fluttering wife. They saw Selim fall upon his knees, and they felt the tears rushing to their own eyes. "Hurray!" shouted little Mr. Saun ders in his excitement. Bowles and the three clerks joined him In the ex hibition. The princess was conscious of the fact that at least five or six pairs of eyes were watching her face. She closed her lips and compelled her eyelids to obey the dictates of a re sentful heart. She lowered them until they gave one the Impression of indo lent curiosity, even indifference. All the while her incomprehensible heart was thumping with a rapture that knew no allegiance to royal conven tions. A few minutes later he was among them, listening, with his cool, half satirical smile, to their protestations of Joy and relief. "Nonsense," be said in his most dep recating voice, taking a seat beside the princess on the railing and fanning himself lazily with his bat, to the mor tification of his body servant, who waved a huge palm leaf in vigorous adula tion. "It waa n othing. Just be fng a witness, that's all. You'll find how easy it Is when you get back to London and have to testify in the Skaggs will contest. Tell the truth, that's all." The princess was now looking at his brown face with eyes over which she had lost control. "Oh, by the bye," lie said, as if struck by a sudden thought, "It is my painful duty to annouuce to the Mesdames von Blitz that they are widows." There was a dead sileuce. The three women stared up at him, uncompre hending. "Yes," he went on solemnly, "Jacob Is no more. He was found guilty by his judges and executed with com mendable haste and precision. He took \ 3) ✓ The princess was followed l>y her two Rapp-Thorberg soldiers. his medicine bravely—twelve leaden pills administered by as many skillful surgeons. But It Is yet too early to congratulate yourselves on your free dom. Rasula has promised to kill all of us, whether we deserve It or not." "They shot him?" demanded Dep pingbam when he had flnlabed. "Admirably. By Jove, those fellows can shoot! They accepted my word against bis—which Is most gratifying to my pride. One other man testified against him—a chap who saw him with the Boers not ten minutes before the attempt was made to rob the vaults. Rasula appeared as counsel for tbe de fense. Merely a matter of form. He knew that he was guilty. There was no talk of a new trial; no appeal to the supreme court, Britt; no expense to the community." He was as unconcerned about It as if discussing the most trivial happen ing of the day. Von Blitz lived not ten minutes after sentence was passed. "As to their intentions toward us," said Chase, "they are firm in their de termination thnt no one shall leave the chateau nlive. Rasula was quite frank with me. He is a cool devil. He calmly notified me that we will all be dead inside of two weeks. No ships will put In here so long as the plague exists. 1 nslced him how we were to die, and he smiled as though he was holding something back as a surprise for us. He came as near to laughing as I've ever seen him when I asked him If he'd forgotten my warships. 'Why don't you have them here?' he asked. 'We're not ready,' said I. 'The six months are not up for nine days yet.' I also made tbe interesting dis covery that suits have already been brought in England to break the will on the grounds of insanity." "But what good will that do us if we are to die here?" exclaimed Bobby Browne. "None whatsoever," said Chase calm ly. "You must admit, however, that you exhibited signs of hereditary In sanity by coming here In the first place. I'm beginning to believe that there's a streak of it In my family too." "And you —you saw him killed?" asked tbe princess in an awed voice, low and full of horror. "Yes. I could not avoid it." "They killed him on your—on your"— She could not complete the sentence, but shuddered expressively. "Yes. He deserved death, princess, i am more or less like tbe Moslem in one respect. I might excuse a thief or a murderer, but I have no pity for a traitor." "You saw him killed?" she said in the same awed voice. Involuntarily drawing away from him. • "Yes," he said, "and you would have seen him killed, too, If you had gone down with me to appear against him." She looked up quickly and then thanked him almost In a whisper. [to be continued.] Bum Fence Posts for Fuel. Lewiston—Because of bad roads a famine in firewood exists on Nez Perce prairie and farmers are pull ing fence posts and cutting them for fuel. Wood is now worth $10 a cord. SODA WATER TANK BURSTS IN PORTLAND. OR., STREETS 'Portland. Or., Dec. 7.—With a concussion which shook nearby buildings to the foundations, wreck ing two-score glass windows, some of them of valuable French plate, throwing tenants of the buildings and pedestrians on the street into a panic of fright, causing damages estimated to be at least $2000, and with a roar which was heard dis tinctly more than a mile away, a wrought steel tank containing car bonic gas fell from a wagon and ex ploded. THE TAR POLICIES An Outline of the Recommendations of the President to Congress in His Annual Message. Washington, Dec. 7.—The program placed before congress by President Taft in his annual message is the most extensive and ambitious ever proposed by a chief executive. It even dwarfs the recommendations made by Roosevelt. Ten main poli cies are urged by the president, be sides a list of minor items covering routine matters and questions of secondary importance. They are: Supervision of the issue of stocks and bonds by interstate corporations. Readjustment of the duties and powers of the interstate commerce commission. Expansion of the duties of the bureau of corporations. Creation of a new bureau in the department of justice to deal with violations of law by interstate car riers. Establishment of a so-called "rail road court." Amendment of the Sherman anti trust law. Creation of a postal savings bank. Ship subsidies. Amendment of the procedure re garding the granting of injunctions. Conservation of natural resources. One of the minor policies favored by the president is the consolidation into a national health bureau of all instruments for the investigation, prevention and cure of disease, which are now included in the na tional government or may properly be included. • • i l '»* . 1 Would Control Stocks. 'S'] The recommendation for the con trol of the issue of stocks and bonds by corporations is aimed at the evil popularly known as stock water ing, while those for the expansion of the duties of the bureau of cor porations and the creation of a new bureau in the department of justice to deal with violations of the anti trust, anti-rebate and railroad laws suggest closer inspection and con trol of interstate corporations. Those for the readjustment of the duties and powers of the interstate commerce commission, the creation of a railroad court and the amend ment of the Sherman anti-trust law, are partially in line with Roosevelt's plans and partially to the initiative of President Taft himself. The work ings of the railroad rate law have not been entirely satisfactory in practice, and this proposed legisla tion is for the purpose of remedying the defects in the act. President Taft would divide the executive and judicial functions of the commission, giving the last named to a court proper. ONE
