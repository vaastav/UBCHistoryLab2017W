First Epistle of Mr. Taft Deals Altogether With the Prob lem of Trusts.. DEFENDS SUPREME COURT Washington, Special: President Taft'p annual message, sent to congress, dealt entirely with the trust Ques tion. The president says that between now and the Christmas holidays he will »end in a series of messages, each one dejiii/ift with separate matters of legis lation for the consideration of congress tiiis winter. Text of the Message. TIK- full text of the message is as follows: To mo oonate and I-Iouuc of Representa tives: This message is the first of several •which 1 shall send to congress during, the Interval between the opening of its regu lar session and its adjournment for the Christinas holidays. The amount of in formation to be communicated as to the operations of the government, the number or Important subjects calling for com ment by the executive, and the transmis sion to congress of exhaustive reports of special commissions, make it impossible to Include in 0110 message of a reasonable length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the attention of trie national legislature at its first regular «SJJ:SiOR. Supreme Court Decisions. In .May lust the supreme court handed down iM-oisiiuiis in the suits in equity brought t.y tho United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard oil trust and of the American Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch-making and serve to "advise the business world authoritatively of tho scope arid operation of the anti trust r.c! ot' 18U0. The decisions do not de part 1.. any substantial way from the previous decisions ot' the court in con struing and applying this important stat ute, bii.l they clarity those decisions by further riciining the already admitted ex ceptions to the literal construction of the act. Ky the dccrees, they l'urnish a use ful jiivi-iruent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of il'i^al trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or sup plemental legislation to make it easier for tho entire business community to square with the rul« of action and legality thus tically established and to preserve the benolit. freedom and spur of reasonable c.ou-.in.il'.um without loss of real efficiency or progress. Ho Change in the Rule. The statute in its /irst section declares to iijygal "every contract, combination in t.ie form of trust or otherwise, or con spiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among Uie several states or with foreign nations," and in the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person v.-nu shall monopolize or combine or con fcpli-K any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nations." In two early casej, where the statute was invoked to enjoin a transportation rate atjreoment between interstate rail road companies, it was held that it was no tleiVn.se to show that the agreement as to rat-?s complained of was reasonable at ct.inn.i.r. law, because it was said that the statute was directed against all con tracts u.:,A combinations in restraint of trade whether reasonable at common law or not. it was plain from the record, howc%v~. that the contracts complained of in those cases would not have been doomed reasonable at common law. In subsequent cases the court said that the 6tatu .-• inuld be given a reasonable con struction a.nd refused to include within Its inhibition, certain contractural re straints i'f trade which it dominated as Incident?.! or indirect. These fuses of restraint of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were instances which, at com mon law, would have been called reason able. In the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, o._-rotore, the court merely adopted the tests of the common law, and in de fining exceptions to the literal application of the s'atute, only substituted for the test of being incidental or incorrect, that of being reasonable, and this, without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now b?en decided would have been de cided the same way if the court had originally accepted in its construction the rule at common law. It has been said that the court, by intro ducing Into the construction of the stat ute common law distinctions, has emas culated it. This is obviously untrue, iiy Its judgment every contract and combi nation in restraint of Interstate trade with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition, or of establishing In whole or part a mo nopoly of such trade. Is condemned by the statute. The most extreme critics cannot instance a case that ought to be condemned under the statute which is not brought within its terms as thus con strued. The suggestion is also made that the supreme court by its decision in the last two eases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited discretion to de termine whether a case of restraint is •within the terms of the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at common law is well understood and Is dearly defined. It docs not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which. In order that it :-hall be enforcable at all, it must be incidental. If It exceeds the needs of that contract, it is void. The tev-t of reasonableness was never applied by the court at common law to contract" or combinations or conspiracies In reselralnt of trade whose purpose was or whos" necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to control prices, or establish monopolies. The courts never assumed power to say that such contracts or combinations or conspiracies might be lawful If the parties to them were only moderate in the use of the power thus secured uid did not exact from the pub lic too preat and exorbitant prices. It Is true thai many theorists, ana others en gaged in business violating the statute, have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts: but no court of author ity has ever attempted it. Certainly there Is nothing In the decisions of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of Judicial discretion in enforcing this statute can derive the slightest sanc tion. Statute Matter of Growth. We have been 21 years making this stat ute effective for the purposes for which It was enacted. The Knight case was dis couraging aftd seemed to remit to the •tates the whole available power to at tack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, however, the error of for Jet! sentenoes as ariS Mi" eoTwnttting of fctudied 

PRESIDENT SENDS HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS that judg­ ment was corrected, and only In the lost three or four years has the heavy hand of the U-.v been laid upon the great- Illegal combii:at .ona that have exerclseo such an absolute dominion over many of our In dustries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pending, hut Juries have felt averse to convicting on men of respectable man ding lb society whoso offense has been regarded as the offense merely statutory. Still, becomes bettor understood of it law, we CM be partakes confident more and deliberate oeflanoe of the that Juries wOl convict individuals and that jail sen tences will be Imposed. Remedy By Dissolution. in the ouinuam oil ctue iue supreme and circuit courts found the combination to be a monopoly of the interstate busi ness of refining, transporting and market ing petroleum and its different products, euected and maintuined through 37 dif ferent corporations, tho block of which was held by a New Jersey company, it in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, directed the transfer pro rata distribution by the New Jersey company of tho stock held by it in the 37 corporations to and among its stockholders and the corporations and individual defendants were enjoined from conspiring cr combining to restore such monopoly and all agreements between the subsidiary corporations tending to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. In tho Tobacco case, the court found that tho individual defendants, 2t) in num ber, had been engaged In a successful effort to acquire complete dominion over the manufacture, salo and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad, and that this had been done by combina tions made with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices and es tablish a monopoly, not only in the manu facture of tobacco, but also of tin foil and licorice used in its manufacture and of its products of cigars, cigarets and snuffs. Tho tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the w^ll of the court and end the violation of the statute. There was here no single holding com pany as in the case of the Standard Oil trust. The main company was the Amer ican Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling and holding company. The plan adopted to destroy the combination and restore competition involved tho redlvl sion of tho capital and plants of the whole trust between some of the compa nies constituting the trust and new com panies organised for the purposes of the decree and made parties to it, and num bering, new and old, 14. Situation After Readjustment. The American Tobacco company (old), readjusted capital, JKi.OOQ.OOO: the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company (new), capi tal, ?U7,000,000 tho I'. Jjorillard company (new), capital, $17,000,000 and the R. J. ficynol.-Js Tobacco company (old), capital, 17,025,000, arc ciliefly engaged in the man ufacture, and sale of cnewlng and smok ing tobacco and cigars. Tho former one tin foil company is divided into two, one of 5825,COO capital and the other of $100,000. The one snuff company is divided into three companies, one with a capital of $15,000,000, another with a capital of £,000, 000. and a third with a capital of 000,040. The licorice companies arc two, one with a capital of 55.75S,300, and another with a capita! of ?2.000.0!)0. There is, also, the British-American Tobacco company, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $£(.000,000 the Porto Kican Tobacco company, with a capital of Sl.KOO.OOO, and the corporation of United Cigar Stores, with a capital of $'.1,000,000. Under this arrangement, each of the different hinds of business will be dis tributed between two or more companies with a divl.-.ion of tho prominent brands in tho same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only possible but necessary. Thus the smoking tobacco business of the country Is divided so that the present independent companies have 21.39 per cent, while the American Tobac co company will have 33.03 per cent, the Liggett & Meyers 20.05 per cent, the Lorillard company 22.32 per cent, and the Reynolds company 2.CO per cent. The stock of the other 13 companies, both pre ferred and common, has been taken from the defendant American Tobacco company and has been distributed among its stock holders. All covenants restricting compe tition have been declared null and further performance' of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different com panies ha: now been given voting power which was denied it under tho old or ganization. The ratio of tho preferred stock to the common was as 76 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change in the character of the ownership and control of each company. In tho original suit there were 29 de fendants who were charged with being the conspirators through whom tho Il legal combinations acquired and exercised its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants will hold amounts of stock in the various distributee com panies ranging from 41 per cent as a max imum to 2$^ per cent as a minimum, ex cept in the case of one small company, the Porto Rlcan Tobacco company, in which they will hold 45 per cent. The 29 individual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock except from each other, and tho group la thus prevented from extending its control dur ing that period. All parties to the suit, and the new companies who are made parties, are enjoined perpetually from In any way effecting any combination be tween any of the companies In violation of the statute by way of resumption of the old trust. Each of the 14 companies is enjoined from acquiring stock in any of the. others. All these companies are en joined from having common directors or officers, or common buying .or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to each other. 8ize of New Companies. Objection was made by certain indepen dent tobacco companies that this settle ment was unjust because it left com panies with very large capital in active business, and that the settlement that would be effective to put all on an equal ity would be a division of the capital and plant of the trust Into small frac tions In amount more nearly equal to that of cach of the independent companies. This contention results from a misunder standing of the anti-trust law and its pur pose. It is not intended thereby to pre vent the accumulation of large capital in business enterprises In which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of pro duction, sale, and distribution. It is di rected against such an aggregation of capital only when its purpose is that of stifling competition, enhancing or controll ing prices, and establishing a monopoly. If we shall have by the decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units Into which the capital and plant have been divided, we shall have accomplished the useful pur pose of the statute. Confiscation Not Purpose. It is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts. Methods of punishment by line or imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of tho corporation or by forfeiture of its goods in transportation, are provided, but the proceeding in equity is a specific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital In violation of the statute. Effectiveness of In Deere*. I venture to say that not In the history of American law has a decree more ef fective for such a purpose been entered by a court than that against the tobacco trust. As Circuit Judge Noyes said In bis judgment approving the decree "The extent to which It has been neces sary to tear apart this combination and force it .Into new forms with the attend ant burdens ought to demonstrate that the federal anti-trust statute is a drastic stat ute which accomplishes effective results* which so long as it stands on the statute books must be obeyed, and which can not be disobeyed without incurring far-reach ing penalties. And, on the other- hand, the suecestiil reconstruction of this or ganisation should teach that the effect off enforcing this statute Is not to destroy, but to reoonutruct not to demolish, but to re-create in accordance with the con ditions which the congrcss has declared shall exist among the peoplo of the United States." Common Stock Ownership. It has been assumed that the present pro rata and common ownership In all these companies by former stockholders of the trust would Insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the companies Into which the trust has by decree been disintegrated. This'Is erron eous and Is based upon the assumed In efficacy and innocuousness of judicial In junctions. The companies arc enjoined from co-operation or combination they have different managers, directors, pur chasing and sales agents. If all or many of the numerous stockholders, reaching into the thousands, attempt to secure con certed action of the companies with a view to the control of the market, their number Is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed, and its prime movers and all Its participants would be at once subjected to contempt proceedings and imprisonment of a summary charac ter. The immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the companies under different mana gers, and then competition must follow, or there will be activity by one company and stagnation by another. Only a short time will inevitably lead to a change In owner ship of the stock, as all opportunity for continued co-operation must disappear. Those critics who speak of this disin tegration in the trust as a mere change ot gHrment« ve not given eon=ideration to the Inevitable working of the decree and understand little the personal danger °f attempting to evade or set at naught the solemn Injunction of a court whose object Is made plain by the decree and whose Inhibitions are set forth with a de tail and comprehensiveness unexampled in tile history of equity jurisprudence. Voluntary Organizations. Tho effect of these two decisions has led to decrees dissolving the combination of manufacturers of electric lamps, a south ern wholesale grocers' association, an In terlocutory decree against the powder trust with directions by the circuit court compelling dissolution, and other combi nations of a similar history are now nego with tho department of justice I oolong to a disintegration bv decree and roorgaization in accordance with law. It .•seems possible to bring about these reor ganisations without general business dis turbance. The Cry for Repeal. But now that the anti-trust act is seen to be effective for tho accomplishment of the purpose of its enactment, we are met ny a cry from many different quarters for its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress, to bo an attex.pt to restore old fashioned methods of destruct ive competition between small units, and to make impossible those usful combina tions of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to continued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent decisions the supreme court makes ciear that thero is nothing in the statute whieli condemns combina tions of capital or mere bigness of plant organissod to secure economy in produc tion and a reduction of its cost. It is onlv when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of im mense size are the stifling of competition, actual and potential, and tho enhancing or prices and establishing a monopoly, that tho statute Is violated. Mere size is no sin against tho law. Tho merging of two or more business plants necessarily eliminates competition between tho units tnus combined, but this elimination is in contravention of the statute only when the combination is made for purpose of ending this particular competition in or der to secure control of, and enhance, prices and creato a monopoly. Lack of Oefiniteness. Tho complaint is made of the statute that it Is not sufficiently deflnito in Us description of that which is forbidden, to enablo business men to avoid its viola tion. The suggestion is, that we mav have a combination of two corporations, which may run on for years, and that subsequently the attorney general may conclude that it was a violation of the statute, and that which was supposed by the combiners to bo innocent then turns out to be a combination in violation of tne statute. The answer to this hypo thetical case is that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable them to suppress competition, con trol prices and establish a monopoly, they know the purpose of their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly lri mind. If what they do is mere ly for the puropso of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of sup pressing competition by use of the bigness or the plan they are creating, then they cannot be convicted at the time the union is made, nor can they be convicted later, unless it happen that later on they conclude to suppress competition and take the usual methods for doing so, and thus establish for themselves a monopoly. They can, In such a case, hardly complain if the motive which subsequently is dis closed is attributed by the court to the original combination. New Remedies Suggested. Much Is said of the repeal of thist stat ute and of constructive legislation In tended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest merchants and business men to follow. It may be that such a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discussions which have been brought out in recent days by the fear of the" continued execution of the antl-tru8t tradesmen law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and have offered no line of distinction or rule of action as defi nite and as clear as that which the su preme court itself lays down in enforcing the statute. Supplemental Legislation Needed. I see no objection—and Indeed I can see decided advantages—in the enactment of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose denounced In the anti-trust law. The at tempt and purpose to suppress a compet itor by underselling him at a price so unprofitable as to drive him out of busi ness, or the making of exclusive con tracts with customers under which they are required to give up association with other manufacturers, and numerous kin- IP" ",®thods for stifling competition and effecting monopoly, should be describe'1 with sufficient accuracy In a criminal statute on tho one hand to enable tlie government to shorten Its task by prose cuting single misdemeanors instead of an entire conspiracy, and, on the other hand, to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business commu nity what must be avoided. Federal Incorporation. a special message to congress on January 7 1910, I ventured to point out the disturbance to business that would prob ably attend the dissolution of these of fending trusts. I said: "But such an nrosecutlon of perity or of must necessarily turb the of capital from that will cause cumstances combinations may means, without ance, of changing a I investigation and possible corporations whose destruction affects not only of wage earners, pros­ the stockholders comfort but of million? employes, and associated tend to confidence of munity, to dry among the the faults of which congress'In dis­ the business up the now com­ flowing source" Its places produce a halt of hoarding, In our and present prosperity suffering and strained cir­ Innocent manv the guilty few. wish In th's clearly to the. of whether, in such a possible thing cannot be ness for The question message to bring consideration and discussion order to avoid business danger, done by some­ whl«h these busi­ be offered a great financial disturb­ the isation, and extent character, organ­ of their business Into OM Within the lines of the law UMer fed-, eral ooatrol and supervllsonu securing oompUance with the ^•XSenenmy, ant:-trust statute. in the tions called Cruets.' indurtrtel combina­ the principal business the sate of good In many states and fa foreign markets In other words, the in- a foreign business far exceeds tne business done in any one state. Th's fact will Justify the federal government ®iT.a a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell In interstate ana foreign commera* the products of useful manufacture under such limita tions as will secure a compliance with the anti-trust law. It is possible so to frame 1ta,tute lhat wh.le it offers protection to a federal company against harmful, vex atious, and unnecessary invasion by the states, it shall subject It to reasonable taxation and control by the states with respect to its purely local business. "Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited from acquiring and holding stock in other corporations (ex cept for special reasons, upon approval by the proper federal authority), thus avoid Ing the creation under national auspices of the holding company with subordinate corporations In different states, which has been such an effective agency in the creation of the great trusts and monopo lies. "If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations in restraint of trade i« J® effectively enforced, it is essen tial that the national government shall provide for the creation of national cor porations to carry on a legitimate busi ness throughout the United Btates. The conflicting laws of the different states of the union with respect to foreign corpor ations make It difficult, if not impossible, for one corporation to comply with their requirements so as to carry on business In a number of different states." renew tho recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of corporations to engage in trade and commerce among the states and wlfli foreign nations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law, and every explanation which was at that time offered to possible ob jections, have been confirmed by our ex perience since the enforcement of the anti-trust statute has resulted in the act ual dissolution of active commercial or ganizations. It is even more manifest now than it wag then that tho denunciation of con spiracies In restraint of trade should not and does not mean the denial of organ izations large enough to be Intrusted with our Interstate and foreign trade. It has been made more clear now than It was then that a purely negative statute like tho anti-trust law may well bo supple mented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate national and foreign commcrrc. Courts Need Aid. The draflng of the decrees in the disso lution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganization into legitimate cor porations, has made It especially appar ent that the courts arc not provided with the administrative machinery to make the necessary inquiries preparatory to re organization, or to pursue such inquiries, and they should be empowered to Invoke tho aid of tho bureau of corporations in determining the suitable reorganization of tho dli'integrated parts. Tljo circuit court and the attorney general were greatly aided In framing the decree in the to bacco trust dissolution by an expert from tho bureau of corporations. Corporation Commission Proposed. I do not set forth in detail tho terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation permitting and aiding the formation of combinations of capital into federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, including pub licity, and to the closest supervision as to the issue of stock and bonds by an execu tive bureau or commission in the depart ment of'commerce and labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that in corporation under a federal law could not exempt the company thus formed and its Incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust law for subsequent illegal conduct, but the pub licity of its procedure and the opportunity for frequent consultation with the bureau or commission in charge of the incorpora tion as to the legitimate purpose of its transactions would offer it as great se curity against successful prosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise. Such a bureau or commission might well be Invested also with the duty already referred to, of aiding courts In the disso lution and re-creation of truts within the law. It should be an executive tribunal of the dignity and power of the comp troller of the currency or the Interstate Comtnfrce commission, which now exer cise supervisory power over important classes of corporations under federal regu lation. The drafting of such a federal incorpora tion law would offer ample opportunity to prevent many manifest evils in corporate management today, including irresponsi bility of control in the hands of tho few who are not the real owners. Incorporation Voluntary. I recommend that the federal charters thus to be granted shall be voluntary, at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection of such a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep with in the lines of the law. Other large com binations that fail to take advantage of the federal Incorporation will not have a right to complain if their failure is as cribed to unwillingness to submit their transactions to the careful official scrut iny, competent supervision and publicity attendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter. Importance of the Act. The anti-trust act Is the expression of the effort of a freedom-loving people to preserve equality of opportunity. It Is the result of the confident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by preserving uncontrolled and un restricted the enterprise of the individual, his industry, h.s Ingenuity, his intelli gence, and his independent courage. For 20 years or more this statute has been upon the statute book. All knew Its general purpose and approved. Many of its violators were cynical over its as sumed impotence. It seemed Im possible or enforcement. Slowly the mills of the court ground, and enly gradually did the majesty of the law assert itself. Many of its statesmen-au thors died before It became a living force, and they and others saw the evil grow which they had hoped to destroy. Now its efficacy is seen now its power Is' heavy now Its object Is near achieve ment. Now we hear the call for Its re peal on the plea that It interferes with business prosperity, and we are advised in most general terms, how by some other statute and In some other way the evil we are Just stamping out can be cured, if we only abandon this work of 20 years and try another expreiment for another term of years. It is said that the act has not done good. Can this be said in the face of the effect of the Northern Securities decree? That decree was in no way so drastic or inhibltive in detail as either the Standard Oil decree or the tobacco decree but did it not stop for all time the then powerful movement toward the control or all the railroads of the country In a single hand? Such a one-man power could not have been a healthful Influence In the republic, even though exercised under the genenu supervision of an Interstate commissioa. Do we- desire to make such ruthless combinations and monoplles lawfulT When all energies are directed, not to ward the reduction of the cost of produc tion for the public benefit by a
