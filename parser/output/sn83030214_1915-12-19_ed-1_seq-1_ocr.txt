Trtttin* I"'ir??u 1 Washington', Dec. 18.?A direct threat to break off relations unless the American demands in the .\n cona case ara met fully and prompt? ly is understood to be contained in the note drafted by Decretar y Fan sing and approved by the President to-day. While this alternative was hin .cd ?t in the first note, which declared that "good relation* between the two countries must rest upon a com? mon regard f<?r law and humanity." the new document, it is declared, leaves no doubt as to the course the United States will pursue unless complete satisfaction is given. The note will be coded and sent to-morrow. Allowing for the usual delays in transmission, due to the lack (tf direct communication with Vienna, it will probably reach Am? bassador 1'enfield on Tuesday lad be presented to the Austrian I eige Offne the following day. Tne administration openly resent? ed to-day the inference that the An t,rtn~ft"~cTs?* Would bo made a subject of debate with Austria-Hungary. While it.' second note is admittedly not an ultimatum, it declines the Austtfm offer to discOSi the fad and reiterate- the demands made in the original protest. Officials declared emphatically that the Ancona case would not be allowed to lapse into a NCOfld I . tania controversy, and that the American public, including even the most vigorous minded, would be sat? isfied with the course taken. Refutes Austrian Claim. The note is designed to meet th? Austrian objection that the first one .?ill ,iot specify clearly either the facts on which the complaint was based or the law which \*-is violated by the Aus? trian commander. The State Depart? ment points to the Austrian Admiralty'* official statement for tl.e fact?, and in rokee the principle of international law that the lives of non-combatants, es? pecially of neutrals, on unresisting merchant ?hips must be spared. The official statement of the Austrian Admiralty said: "Submarine pursued steamer und continued firing. Steamer stopped only whep hit sevrai time?. .Submarine al? lowed forty-five minutes to abandon steamer, where panic reigned, but only a small number of boats wore lowered, and occupied principally by crew. A great number of boats probably luf ? ? to save all the passengers re mained unoccupied. After fifty minutes the submarine, in the presence of an? other approaching steamer, submerged ami torpedoed the Ancona. which sank after further forty-five minutes." This admission, the .Sute Depart? ment holds, contains all the facts nec? io the American case. The new note will mike th:.-. point clear. It will insist that without further discussion the Austrian gOTQWQBI grant the de - contained in ?! ?? fir", note. -.-.
