MESSAGE. Fellow-Citizens of the Senate awl ILiuse of Itepresentaltves : Since your last annual assembling an other year of health and bountiful har vests has passed. And while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light lie gives us, trusting that in His own good time, and wise way, all will yet be well. Ihe correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is herewith submitted, in vir tual compliance with a request to that effect, made by the House of I'epresen- tatives near the. close of tho last session of Congress. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are, might reasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of our domestic ditliculties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that position, which has proved r nly less injurious to themselves, than to our own country. Uut the tem porary reverses which afterwards befell the national arms, ana which were ex aggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice. Ihe civil war, which hus so radically changed, fur the moment, the occupation and habits of tho American people, has necessarily disturbed the Hocial condi tion, and affected very deeply the pros perity of the nations with which we have earned on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same time, excited political ambi tions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation through out the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have fjrborno from taking part in any controversy between foreign States, and between parties or factions in such Mates. We have attempted no propagandist!!, and acknowledged no revolution. But we have left to every nation the exclusive conduct andd management of its own allairs. Uur Mrup.tMe has been, of .course. contemplated by foreign nations with reference less to its own merits, than to its supposed, and often exaggerated ef' fects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless, com plaint on the part of thU government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise The treaty with Great Dritain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into operatiou with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it. on the part of her Majesty's government, has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the L'nited States, and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens The conventinu with Hanover for the abolition of the stade dues has been car ried into full effect, under the act of Concress for that pnriose. A blockade of three thousand miles of sea-coast could not be established, and vigorously enforced, in a season of great commercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and iullicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their subjects A civil war occurring in a country where foreicners reside and carry on trade under treaty stipulations, is neces warily fruitful of complaints of the vio lation of neutral. riutits. All such colli sionstend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between nations w bioh have a common i iuterest in preserving peace and friend 1 ship. In clear cases of these kinds have, so far as possible, heard aud re- dusted complaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There still, Iwrwever, alare and an augmenting number ot doubtful cases upou which the government is onable to agree with me governments wnose protection is tie- I ruanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the Unit ed States, or their citizens, suffer wrongs from the naval or military Authorities of foreign nations, which the governments of those States are not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign States, thus interested, mutu al conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted. I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark Admiral P. Torden skiold, which vessel was, in May, 18G1, prevented by the commanderof the block aiding force off Charleston from lea'ving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar privilege had.shortly before, been granted to an English vessel. I have di rected the Secretary of State to causo the papers in the case to be communi cated to the proper committees. Applications have been made to me by many freo Americans of African descent to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at homo and abroad some from inter ested motives, others upon patriotic con siderations, and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments have suggest ed similar measures; while, on the other hand, several of the Spanish-American republics have protested against the sending of such colonies to their respec tive territories. Under these circum stances, I have declined to move apy such colony to any state, without first obtain ing the consent of its government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights of freemen; and I have, at the same time, o lie red to the states situated within the tropics, or having colonies there, to ne gotiate with them, subject to the advico aud consent or the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humane. Liberia and Hay ti are. as yet. the only countries to which colonics of African descent from here, could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens; and 1 regret to say such per sons, contemplating colonization, do not seem so willing to migrate to those coun tries, as to 6ome others, nor so willing as think their interest demands. I be lieve, however, opinion among them, in this respect, is itn proving; and that, ere be an augmented, and considerable micra'ion to both these countries, from the United States. The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Turr key has been carried into execution A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with Liberia; and a similar ne gotiation is now pending with tho repub lie of llayti. A considerable improve lnent of the national commerce is expect ed to result from thefe measures. Our relations with Great Britain, I ranee, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, the Nether lands, Italy, Borne, and tho other Luro pean states, remain undisturbed. Very favorable relations also continue to be maiutaiaed with Turkey, Morocco, Chi na, and Japan. During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the independent states of our own continent, but, more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed, aro believed to lie entertained by these neighbors, whoso safety and progress, are so uiti niately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa liica, Hunduras, Peru and Chile. The commission under the convention with the republic of New Granada closed its session, without having audited and passed upon, all the claims -which were submitted to it. A proposition upend ing to revive the convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint oommission between the United States and the republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and submitted its report. I have favored the project for connect ing the United States with Europe by an Atlantic telegraph, and a similar project t: extend the telegraph from San Fran cisco, to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the lino which is being extended across the Kussian empire. The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have re mained undisturbed by the civil war; and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justihes au expectation that some of them will S'jjd be in a con dition to be organized as States, and bo constitutionally admitted into tho Fed eral Union. The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ouht to be devt lop ed as rapidly as noible. Every step in rthat direction would have a tendency to - improve the revenues of the government, I and diminish the burden of the people. j It is worthy ol your serious considera I tion w hi ther Rome extraordinary meas- is urrs to promote that end cannot be loplcd. The means which suggests it self as most likely to ! ellecUve, is a scientific exploration of the mineral re- pions in mose .territories, witn a view to I the publicatioa of its results at home 1 i a; .r 11. uai and in foreign countries results which cannot fail to be auspicious. Ihe condition ot the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. Ihe vast expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude, and certainty, unusual in similar circum stances; and the public credit lias been fully maintained. The continuance of the war, however, and the increased dis bursements made necessary by tho aug mented forces now in the field, demand your best reflections as to tho best modes of providing the necessary revenue, with out injury to business, aud with tho least possible burdens upon labor. I he suspension of speie payments by the banks, soon after the commencement of your last session, made large issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could the' payment of the troops, and the satisfaction of other just demands, bo so economically, or so well provided for. Thfj judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an universal cur rency; and has satisfied, partially, at least, and for the time, the long felt want of an uniform circulating medium. saving thereby to the people, immense sums in discounts and exchanges. A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest petiod compatible with due regard to all interests concerned, should ever be kept in view. Fluctua tions in the value of currency are al ways injurious, and to reduce these fluc tuations to the lowest point possible will always be a leading purpose iu wise legis lation. Convertibility, prompt and cer tain convertibility into coin, is gener ally acknowledged to bo the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely doubtful whether a circula tion of United States notes, payable in coin, and sulliciently large tor the wants of the people, can be permanently, use- lully and safely maintained. is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be, and tho great ad- advantages of a sale and uniform currency secured i I know of none which promises so cer tain results, aud is, at the same time, bo unobjectionable, as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress, well guarded in its pro visions, lo such associations the gov ernment might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper officers, beiug uniform in appearance aud security, and convertible always into cin, would at once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facil itate commerce by cheap aud safe ex changes. A moderate reservation trom the in terest on the bonds would compensate the United States for the preparation and distribution of the notes, and a general supervision of the system, aud would lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit, moreover, would bo greatly improved, and tho negotiation or new loans greatly facilitated by the steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of tho proposed sys tern would create. It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment, that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all existing interests, by the opportunity ottered to existing insti tutions to reorganize under the act, sub stituting only the secured uniform na tional circulation lor the local and va rious circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by them. The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans, and balance from the preceding year, for the fiscal year endine on the d'.Jtu June, lHhZ, were $I83,8S5,217 (X5, of which sum 19,030,- .".07 0- wem derived from customs Sl.79o.331 73 from the direct tax; from public lands $152,203 77; from miscel laneous sources, 931,787 01; from loans in all forms, .529.092.400 50. The re mainder, 2,257,005 bO, was the balance from last year. The disbursements during tbo same period were for congressional executive, and judicial purposes, $5,939,001) 29; for foreign intercouise, 1,339,710 35; for miscellaneous tApenses, including the mints, loans, post ofllco deficiencies, col lection of revenue, and other like charges, 14.129.771 70; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,933 under the War Department, 391,303, 407 .'K, under the Navy Department, 42,074,509 09: for interest on public debt, 13,190,321 4.j; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan, aud redemptions, 90,090,922 09; making an aggregate of 570,811,700 25, and leaving a balance in the treasury on the first day of July, 1S02, of i3,on,rpj ai. It should be observed that the sum of 90,090,922 09, expended for reimburse ments and redemption of public debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted, both from re ceipta aud expenditures, leaving the ac tual receipU for the year $ 137,733,32 1- Ui, and the expenditures. S 174.744.773- ia 1 . 10. Other information on theauhlertof the finances will bo found In the report of of the Secretary of the Tieasury, to whose statements and views I invite yonr most candid and considerate atten tion. The reports of the Secretaries of War. and of the Navy, are herewith transmit ted. These reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and extensive transac tions and operations conducted through those departments. Nor could I give a summary of them here, upon any princi ple, which would admit of its being much shorter than tho reports themselves. 1 therefore content myself with laying the reports before you, and asking your attention to them. It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in tho financial'condition of the Post Office Department, as com pared with several preceding years. The receiUs for the fiscal year lisOl amounted to 3,319,290 40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year. Not withstanding the cessation "of revenue from the so-called seceded States during tho last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sulhcient to produce a revenue dur ing the same year of $8,299,820 90, being only 50,000 less than was derived from all the States or the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1801 was 13,006,759 11. ror the last year the amount has been reduced to '11,125,304 13, showing a decrease of about 2,481,000 in the ex penditures as compared with the preced ing year, and about $3,750,000 as com pared with the fiscal year 18G0. The deficiency in the department for tho pre vious year was $l,bol,yuo !)8. lor the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112, 814 67. These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail ser vice in tho insurrectionary .States, and in part to a careful review of all expen ditures in that department in the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved. The Postmaster General has also opened a correspondence, through the Department of State, with foreign governments, proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates ot foreign post a; and to expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally . important to our adopted citizens, and to the commercial interests of this country, has been fa vorably entertained, and agreed to, by all the governments from whom replies have been received. I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster General in his report respecting the further legisla tion required, in his opinion, for the benefit of tho postal service. Ihe Secretary of t ho Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands " Ihe public lands have ceased to be a sourceof revenue. From the 1st of July. 1801, to the 30th of September, 1802, Ihe entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were 137,li0 0 a sum much less than the expenses of our land system during the aame period, ihe homestead law, which will take ellect on the 1st of Jan uary next, oilers such inducements to settlers, that sales for cash cannot be ex pected, to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of tho General Land Odice, and the cost of surveying and bringing tho land into market." The discrepancy between tho.sum here stated as arising from tho sales of the public lands, aud the sum derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department ariBes, as I under stain), from the fact that the peri d of time, though apparently, were not really, coincident at the beginning point the Treasury report including a considerable sum now, which had previously been re ported from tho Interior sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum de rived from the three months now reported upon by tho Interior, and nut by the Treasury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and, at several points, have engaged iu open hostilities against tho white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying fie In dian country south of Kansas, renounced their allegiance to the United Mates, and entered luto treaties with the insurgent Those who remained loyal to tho United Stati s were driven from the country.--The thief of the Cherokee has visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relatiot.a of the tribe with the U uiied St a ten. He alleges that they were constrained, by euperior force, to enter into trea'ies with the insurgents, aud that the United States neglected to fur nish the protection which their treaty stipulations required. In the in 'iith of August last the Sioux Indium, iu Minnesota, attacked thu set tlements in tht ir vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing, indiscriminately, men, h ouiennaiid children. This attack Mas wholly uueapeeted, and, therefore, no means of defence, had lceri provided. It is estimated that not lets than eight hundred person were killed by the Indians, and a large amount o( property was destroyed. ITow thfsout- break was induced is nol dofinitelr known, and suspicions, which may bo unjust, need not be stated. Infor mation was received by tho Indian bureau, from different sources, about the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be madd upon the wnito iettlements by all the tribea between tho Mississippi river and tha Uocky Mountains. The Sfato of Minne- sota has suffered creat inlurr from thin Indian war. A large portion of her ter ritory has been depopulated, and a se vere los has been sustained by tho de struction of property. The people of that State manifest much anxiety lor tho removal of the tribes beyond tho limits of tho State as a iruarantee against futuro hostilities. Tho Commissioner of Indian Affairs will furnish full details. I sub mit for your especial consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodelled. Many wise and irood men. have impressed me with tho belief that this can be profitably done. I submit a statement of the proceedincs of commissioners, which shows the pro gress mat lias been made in theenferprise of constructing tho Pacific railroad. And this suggests tho earliest completion of this road, and also the favorablo ac tion of Congress upon the project now pending before then) for enlarging tho capacities of the great canals in New lork and Illinois, as being of vital, and rapidly increasing importance lo the whole nation, and especially" to the vast interior region hereinafter to bo noticod at some greater length. I purposo having prepared and laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statis tical information upon this subject. Tho military and commercial Importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan canal, and imptoving the Illinois river, is pre sented in tho report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of War, and now trans mitted to Congress. I respectfully ask attention to it To carry out the provisions of the act of CoHgress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the department of Agricul ture of tho United States to bo onrau- ized. ' The Commissioner informs mo that within tho' period of a few months this department has established aa extensive system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which promise to ellect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvements in agriculture, in tho introduction of new products, and lit the collection of fhe agricultural statistics of tho different Stat0. Also that it will soon bo prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants and cuttinss, and has already published, and liberally diffused, much valuable in formation in anticipation of a more elab orate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in chemical science now in progress in the laboratory. 1 he creation of this department was for the more immediate benefit of a larce class of our most valuable citizens: and I trust that the liberal basis upon which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize, at no distant day, all tho fondest antici pations of its most sanguine friends, and become the fruitful eonrco of advantage to all our people. On the twenty-second day of Sepetm ber last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is here with submitted. In accordance with the purpose express ed in the second paragraph of that paer, 1 now respectfully recall your attention to what may bo called "compensated emancipation." A nation mty be said (o consist of its territory, its people, and ils laws. The territory is the only part which is of cer tainly durability. "One generation pass eth away, and another generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever." It is of the first importance to duly consider, and estimate, this ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth' Surface which i owned and inliaKitot !. il people of the United States, is well adapted to le tho home of one national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more. Its vast extent, arid its variety of climate and productions, are of ad vantage, in this age, for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam, tele graphs, and intelligence, have brought these, to be an advantageous combina tion, for one united people. In tho inaugural address I briefly pointed out tne total inadequacy of dis union, as a remedy for tho difference between the people of the two section. I did so in language which I cannot im prove, and which, therefore, I beg to re peat: "One section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while the other believe it it icr.,y, and ought not to be extended. This i the only substantial dip.ite. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression ofth.- foreign slave trade, are rsch a well enforced, iMThapa, a any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people irni-erfectly supports the law itself. i he great U.dy of the wonle abide by thl dry legs I obligation in both cases, and n few break over in each. This, I think, canuot b perfectly cured; and it would bo lL
