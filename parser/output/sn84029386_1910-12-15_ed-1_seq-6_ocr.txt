Tbe presidenfa message is Just such a document as Is needed In this time of the rise of politicians who claim to be doing things for the peo ple but are really working tbe public for their own pocketbooks. He calls attention of this class of political vultures that there are plenty of laws for the control of corporations. The Sherman anti-trust law la a bug aboo to every reformer. He wants the government to go after every 

NOME NEEDED LEGISLATION. The editor of the Chapman Gazette Is a true reformer. He does not fool with hifalutln nonsense but gets right down to practical things. He suggests this as a starter and it is worth thinking about: ' If our honorable Senator and ftep-r-sentHtlves want to do a long jf ftliig public a kindness and piss a law which will l.mko men of scant liirsiilo bdornmeu.

A report comes from Topeka thai governor, Stubbs' business adminis tration has a little work .started on the Memorial Building again. Three it four men have been working In the basement for tbe last few weeks on a small contract While these men are at work the state Is paying sn Inspector $5 a day to see that they do their work properly. Incidental ly, It Is also, paying a state archl tect at the rata of $2,600 ycatfTor the same thing. At this gait,, it it easy to understand why Governor Stubbs thought that 1200,000 would not be enough with whlch'to build a Memorial Building. Sallna Union. WHAT ABOUT THIS? A Topeka dispatch says: "It. J. Hopkins, lieutenant governor-elect. Is proceeding on ;the theory that there wilt be oo change In the Senate rules this -winter regarding the appoint ment of committees by the lieutenant governor. , Mr. Hopkins stated to friends here that be la preparing to announce appointment shortly after the senate convene. It is under stood here that he expects to depose Senator Frank Price of Clark county from his place at the head of the Judiciary opmmittee and give the place to Senator Clad Hamilton of Shawnee and that he will also make a change In the railroad committee of which Senator George H. Hunter of Sumner county was chairman at tbe last session. So far as can be learned now these are the two com mittee with which Governor Stubbs and his friends are most displeased." Who gave the governor and Hop kin authority to name the commit tee weeks In advance? Are the member of the senate a lot of sheep to lit back and be handled In this way? Besides did not our peerless Insurgent leader declare that Can nonlsm was wicked? Let's be con sistent at least. .
