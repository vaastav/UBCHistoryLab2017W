ELASTIC AND SAFE CURRENCY. The safest, cheapest, uid most elastic government currency has of tQn been proposed, and its adoption as often defeated by self-seeking banking interests. But now that postal savings banks are likely to be in demand, in consequence of the present closing down of cash payments by savings banks every where, this elastic government cur rency might easily be made a fea ture of the postal savings bank scheme. For the saving bank fea ture let all post offices receive de posits of savings any amount from one dollar up, and issue for them a money order bearing inter est, say, at 1 per cent for every four months—3 per cent a year and for the elastic currency feature, let these interest-bearing money orders be exchangable at any post office on demand for non-interest bearing government currency. Under some such system, none of the thrifty poor would be plundered of their savings, nor would there ever be a dearth of cash When currency was abundant, it would be surrend ered for interest-bearing postal money orders, which would serve for savings, when currency was scarce, the savings would be turned into ready cash by exchange of money orders for currency. This combination of postal savings and elastic currency would be bad for savings banks and money sharks but it would make the people's hoard secure, while providing in dustry with a safe and feasible cur rency.—Louis F. Post "The Pub lic." The suggestions made by Mr. Post are timely and valuable. The recent near-crisis in the midst of plenty and with a larger per capita of money—and "sound money" at that—than the country has had for more than a generation, if not in all its history, shows conclusively that the present money system or banking system, is at fault some where. The ever-present danger is that the people will get scared by some bugaboo and withdraw their money from circulation. No mat ter how large the circulating medi um is, a scare of that kind can in a few days stop the wheels of busi ness and bring enormous financial losses to the country. A large amount of circulating medium is necessary to keep up the range of prices. This is now acknowledged by even those who most severely criticised this statement in 1896.would But the amount can never be made large enough to prevent a crisis fol lowing a scare. The people must have confidence in the depositary in order to keep them from withdraw ing their money from circulation. There is only one banker who canreform inspire that confidence, and that is Uncle Sam. His backing of na tional bank notes makes them cir culate as money, tho they are not legal tender. If he can consistent ly go into the banking business to the extent of securing the bank notes, and paying from 2J to 5 per cent for the privilege of so doing, why would it not be proper for him to take the far more necessary step of safeguarding the savings of the people? National bank notes are not a necessity they are only a pro vision for increasing the capital of banks. But it is absolutely neces sary that confidence be establihsed so that when money is needed it may be found in circulation instead of *4 being hidden. The proposed sys tem would not interfere with legiti mate banking business, such as it existed before the special privileges were given to one class of banks. It would do away with savings banks, but there is no reason why the entire nation should be kept in this constant danger of financial trouble to provide a profitable busi ness for a few banks. Private mail carriers lost a lucrative job when the government went into the mail business, but no one even remem bers that now or would think of going back to the old system. Gov ernment exists for the benefit of all the people—in theory at least—and the interests of all the people are more important than those of a small class. The "elastic" part of the propo sition would probably not be used very much, as with safe banking there would be no cause for financial flurries or panics. Some measure in the line of emergency currency will probably be forced thru congress in the near future. Why not make it a meas ure that would remove the greatest cause for "emergencies?" 

DEATH OF KING OSCAR. King Oscar, the venerable mon arch of Sweden, passed away last Sunday morning, in the 79th year of his life and the 36th year of his reign. It is no empty phrase to say that his death causes a feeling of universal sorrow among his peo ple both in the old country and in America, for he had truly won their affections by his noble and kind character. Never has a king won a greater victory than old King Oscar did when he conquered the stirring passions among the upper classes in Sweden at the time Nor way separated from the kingdom. Only the universal love of his peo ple could have made them listen to his calm word of counsel. No mas ter what different views a person may have of that separation, de pending upon nationality and sur roundings, he must after reflection acknowledge that after Norway had taken the decisive step it was far better that it be peacefully acqui esced in than that a bloody war with its horrible after results of sorrow, misery and suffering, debt, and worst of all, the bitterest kind of feeling on both sides, should re sult. It requires the greatest kind of courage to do the right thing un der such circumstances. No doubt Oscar's last years were saddened by the event, but the sadness was tem pered by the demonstrations of af fection that his people gave him and the revival of a truly national feeling, a resolve to make their country greater by making the peo ple great in the true sense. The king will be succeeded by his oldest son Oscar Gustaf, who will take the throne under the name of Gustaf V. writes new forms of Life and Endowment policies with Guaranteed Double Annual Allotments, the latest development in Life Insurance Guarantees from ten per eent to twenty per cent Annual Casta Allotments, and Mortuary Allotments which increases from $25 to $50 per thousand on each anniversary of the policy While remembering your loved ones this Christmas,' why not take a life insurance policy that will protect them on future occa sions of this kind, and at the same time protect you in old age. The Central Life offers these policies as the most perfect answer to a public demand. It wi'l pay you to investigate. DODGES TARIFF ISSUE. While President Roosevelt, in his annual message, is as bold as ever in denouncing violations of law by big corporations, he is more than usually timid when he gets to the tariff proposition. In the gentlest of terms he intimates that possibly at some indefinite time it might be permissible to reverently examine the tariff schedules to see if it be safe to in any manner alter them. But it must not be done now, when the republican party, the friend of the tariff, has the op portunity of doing it, because there is an election coming next year. By the same line of reasoning no measure ought to be under taken at any time, for there is al ways a national election coming af ter the long term of congress, and there is never time for any but rou tine measures at the short session. The truth of the matter seems to be that when he talks of law en forcement againts the big corpora tions the president knows that he is backed by the entire nation, but when it comes to the tariff his par ty is divided and no reform mea sure in that line could be passed without the aid of the democratic party, and of course it would not do to give the democrats a chance to get any credit for any such meas ure. The politician is stronger than the reformer in this instance. The Central Life Assurance Society of the U. 8. J. F.

TAYLOR, SPECIAL, AGENTS, Offioe*, Bunk of WiUmar Building ^^f|, •20 It is somewhat disappointing to thepractice friends of the president, who have admired him more for his supposed fearlessness than for anything else, to "find him crawling behind such a flimsy excuse to get out of the nec essity of taking a definite stand. The present tariff is either right or wrong. It is not a question of pro tection or free trade. It is merely a question of whether or not the present schedules are not too high, especially when protecting monop olies. If they are right, the presi dent should say so if he considers any of them too high or too low he ought to say so and put his party on record. Certainly the party ought not to fear to do the right thing just before an election. By doing nothing they give tho people the impression that they are not willing to do the right thing. Such an impression may induce the peo ple to put in power a party that proposes to do something, not at some indefinite future time and in an indefinite manner, but as soon as it gets the chance and with a definite understanding as to the manner of reform—whether upward or downward. The people are at present in no mood for dilly-dally ing they want definite action, and political cowardice is dangerous. The president is worrying about the reduction of the strength of the standing army and some of his sub ordinates have even gone so far as to suggest conscription to fill the depleted ranks. It is pretty safe to say, however, that any party that tried to pass such a measure would get the "grand Oriental bounce" so quickly that it would never recover from the effects. The American people are not worry ing over the army's size. They know from past experience that when the country needs soldiers they will come from the fields, the mines and the shops by the millions and no power that ever ran up against the volunteer soldiers of America is anxious for another dose of the same medicine. The young men of America are needed in the army of peaceful conquest of the nation's resources and can do their country more good there than by lying idle in the army barracks. 

ATTORNEY GENERAL YOUNG. The following extracts are taken from a speech delivered by Attor ney General Young at a banquet re cently given in Red Wing: "The paramount question in American politics is how to estab lish and maintain the true relation between business and government. "At the present time we have in this country about 210,000 miles of railroad, which is capitalized at the enormous sum of twenty billion dol lars, and which receives annually from the people for its service in transportation over two billion dol lars. Minnesota has its fair pro portion of this railroad mileage, there being in the state about 8,000 miles of road, capitalized at about $450,000,000, and earning annually from the people of Minnesota about $85,000,000. These enormous fig ures show that the cost of railroad transportation in this country far exceeds the cost of maintaining the government. In this state the amount paid to railroads is three times as much as is paid for taxes for all state, county, school and municipal purposes, including all sums paid for the construction oi improvement of other highways. "No one is exempt from paying his share ot the cost of railroad freights. It makes no difference whether you are a shipper or re ceiver of freight or not. THE 

PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS BEAR THE BURDEN. "The people of this country have had a rude awakening from the be lief that competition left to itself will prove a perfect business regu lator. They even woke up to the -act that in the field of the public service, competition may be the op posite of beneficial. The logical results of unlimited competition has so often brought disaster to the persons engaged in it, with no per manent benefit to the public, that there has grown up in this country what seems like an irresistible tendency toward combination cen tralization in business, which we have been trying to resist by tne enactment of anti-trust laws. We have now reached a condition where many of our bright ast statesmen are declaring that laws to compel competition in business have out lived their usefulness. "The plan of our dual govern ment is mechanically perfect and there never need be a collision be tween the two sovereignties, if the courts of the two jurisdictions, knowing their respective limita tions, will scrupulously keep within them. The rules for determining which sovereignty has jurisdiction over any subject are very simple. UNLESS EXPRESS AUTHORITY OVER THE SUBJECT CAN BEsee FOUND IN THE FEDERAL CON STITUTION, SUCH O N O EXISTS IN THE STATE. (Gen. Young could be admitted to the democratic party on that statement alone, without further examination. —Ed.) The contention of the rail roads that the states are without power to regulate them under the present status of the law is unten able and will not be upheld. But while hiding behind that unwar ranted claim they have adopted a which is calculated to de- stroy all efficiency in state regula tion by opposing state laws with federal injunctions. The states are claiming against these injunctions their immunity from suit, and pointing out that such practices would deprive them of their sover eign powers. The states have a constitutional immunity from suit under the law of the land. The 11th amendment provides that the judicial power of the United States should not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity prose cuted against a state by a citizen of any other state or foreign country. Every state officer comes, while per forming his official duties, within the meaning of the rule making a state immune from suit if any state officer can be enjoined, then the conduct of the state government is to that extent interfered with. If the hands of the state can be tied with reference to such orders by federal injunctions, thus not on ly suspending the operation of the orders but prohibiting the institu tion of proper proceedings for the enforcement in the local courts, the s^ate governments are hopelessly handicapped, and the rights of the public are completely subordinated to the private rights of the carrier. There is no question now before the American people which overshadows this in importance"
