It has not yet J been conclusive ly developed hero what is to bo tho ef fect on tho disordered state of tho em pire of tho relinquishment temporarily at least, of tho purposto of tho powers to introduce additional guardships into tho Dardanelles for tho .'protection of for eigners in tho domnuis of tho sultan. Tho ordering back to Salpuicabay of tho British gunboat Drjfad, which had been ordered up to tho Dardanelles at tho re quest of the British ambassador, Sir Philip Carrie, in anticipation of tho promised granting of tho firmans by tho sultan for warshipa! to pass through, is officially explainedon the ground that tho proposed action would do moro harm than good by inflaining tho fanaticism of tho Turks agaiiist foreigners on ac count of the supposed affront to tho Bultan of what would, in effect, havo amounted to a , naval demonstration against Constantinople Tho effect of tlio abandonment of its purpose by Gretvt Britain on tho situa tion in Turkey is, awaited with anxiety and great intovest. Tho question of guardships seems at a standstill for tho present, thougli tho threat of Sir Philip Currio to renew his purpose unless for eigners should' be exempt from outrage is still open. , Undoubtedly one effect of tho order ing back of the Dryad to Salonica is that tho belief in tho often-alleged con cert of the powers in their attitude toward Turicoy is waning. Tho sultan is known tp have been skeptical as to this concert for some time past and it is said has based his long-continued op position to Great Britain's demands upoiya belief that no such concert ex isted'or that it could not endure for any length of timo. This belief can not but fYmvo been in part confirmed by Great ' Britain's withdrawal of her demand aft er it had been so strenuously piessod to the very vergo of a crisis. Whether Great Britain is influenced by tho alleged danger to foreigners from fanatic Turks which would ensue upon tho proposed demonstration, or whether fcho has learned to doubt tho approval of her action which might bo accorded by tho other powcis, is therefore a question which is discussed on both sides. United States Minister A. W. Terrell ht.s received from Aintab, on tho south ern slopes of Mount Taurus, a dispatch which states that? the American mis sionaries there are safe and wcro un harmed in tho recent massacre and have not required tho services of special guards. Reports of a fanatical outbreak in Civsaiea havo created anxiety as to the saiory ol tho American mission tliero :.ml -Uiuictcr ifiTcll has wind an in . qniiy, to which an answer is still await ed. The nonarrival ot private letters tiom Kharpoot und Sivas also" has a dis quieting eiicct. Oillcial dispatches describe a small conflict in Zillica, in tho villayet of Sivus; in which four Mussulmans and fivo Armenians wero killed, and another at Enclerhin, whore Armenian rebels at tacked tho town, burned the govern ment buildings ami pillaged the Mussul mans' villages in tho vicinity of Pias. Troops havo been tent to repress tho outbioak: A letter from Aden, Arabia, dated Nov. 20, gives uctails of tho Arabian re volt against tho sultan in Yemen, tho coffee growing district of southwestern Aiabia. Tho importance of tho out break lies in its proximity to Mecca. Ihe loss to tho saltan of the Mussul man holy city would probably mean his deposition, rienco tho strenuous oillcial denials which have been mado of tho ex istence of the rebellion. So far, tho rovolt has boon confined to tho district around Kharmar, two days' join-Ley iiom Saana, tho capital of Yo men. Tho lcucla number 45,000 Arabs armed with Martini and Snyder rifles and led by Sayyid, a pretender to the iniaunship of tho wholo Yemen country, who wields a gi-e.it influence and sur reptitiously collects tribute or taxes from ull Arab tribes under Turkish rule. Six thousand Turkish troops recently arrived at S.mna tiom Constantinople and wero distributed among tho garri sons in tho Kharmar district. The ioU'Is had ahruuv taptoicd, after eovero lighting and (.icat Uoodshed, two Turkish forts at Khamiu- and Bald buda. "Ill tho latter H09 Turks wore killed. Tho garrison fled to Masmer and begged tho iio Sheikhs thero to help to recapturo Bulrtlratui, Tho Sheik)is refused and wcro taken to Sauna and imprisoned. Tho telegraph is constantly cut and Sayyid, tho pretender, bnr:.s letters and piesonts which tho sultan sends. CISTERNS CRACKED. A l'ecullur Kll'cct of tlie Enrthciuaho No ticed lit Aclums County, O. Pkebt.es, O., Dec. 2, Since tho good rains have fallen und tho long anc, so vero drouth has been broken, a startling revelation has been mado. Not only in this place, but other places throughout the county a largo number of cisterns do not hold water, and many people ore ' placed in tho same condition as before ihe rains. Investigations havo been mado, and it is generally supposed that the cracking open of tho walls and floors of cisterns is duo to tho rocont earth quake shock which was so plainly felt. Wells and springs havo not been affected in any way. CORNER IN CAMPHOR. landing Now York Druggists Fear One During Tills Winter. New Yohk, Deo. 2. Tho leading drug firms of this city are apprehensive that tho coming winter and spring will seo a corner in camphor. Tho price of this article has been steadily increasing, until from 87 cents a pound only a fow mouths ago, it has advanced to CO cents a pound, with ovory prospect of going still higher. Tho importanco of such an advance ciui bo imagined when it is realized that in 1894 no less than 1.82J, 032 pounds of camphor wore imported to this country. Colonel North, tho famous "Nitrato King," has been credited with boins tho head and fiout of tho syndicate that purposes this corner, but in tho opinion of leading druggists, ho is not a present factor. A member of one of tho largest wholesale druse establishments said to a roporter today that ho did not think Colonel North was in it. "I am satis fied that ho waB upjto a short time ago practically the head of tho syndicato," said he, "but ho has cntiiely withdrawn from it. Thero is no doubt but that a sydicate does control the supply of camphor. In fact, so fully convinced are wo of this that we havo laid in an unusual stock, so as to bo prepared for a corner." 

HONORABLE AND UNUSUAL. Labor Lender McGann Will Relinquish Ills Certificate of Klcctlon. Washington, Dec. 2. Representative Lawrence McGann of Chicago, who held a scat in the Fif ty-second and Fifty third congresses and was chairman of tho committee on labor in tho last con gress, will furnish to the house tho un usual spectacle of a member making a voluntary relinquishment of tho seat to which ho holds the certificate, As soon as he is able to secure recognition from tho speaker, Mr. McGann will make a statement to the house to the effect that his Republican opponent, Mr. Hugh R. Belknap, is entitled to tho seat and that ho (McGann) waves all claims thereto. Tins step will mako it po-wiblo for the committee on elections, as soon as it is organized, to roport in favor of seating Mr. Belknap and will relievo that gen tleniw i of the necessity of making a con tost beforo tho committee. Mr. Belknap, who will succeed Mr. McGann, is a son of Hon. W. W. Belknap, who was sec retary of war under Presidont Grant. big forgerTesT Tho Mnnager of an Ali tract Company Ar rested. Perry, la., Dec. 2. An alleged big swindler was run down Saturday. J. E. Alpaugh, manager of tho Dallas County Abstract company of this city, was arrested at tho instance of tho Scott County Savings bank of Daven port on tho charge of forgery. Alpaugh has been loaning money for the Dav enport concern, placing in that way, it is said, about $10,000. Saturday C. A. Ficko of Davenport, attorney for the bank, arrived hero and nflor an investi gation claimed that the mortgages by which a largo part of tho money was se cured are forged. Ho caused Alpaugh's arrest on four counts of forgery and ut tering forged paper. Mr. Ficko places tho bank's loss, so far as discovored, at $18,000. There aio repoits that other concerns are also victims, but these aro not verified. Alpaugh waived examin ation and in default of $10,000 bail was taken to the county jail at Adel.

Tho Fronch liner La Normandio, which arrived hero Sunday, had among her passengers Baron Do Batz and his friend Baud on do Mony, who aro going to the Rocky mountaiu country on pleasure and busi ness, of which they declined to speak.

NOTHING IS PROMISED In tho Way of Legislation This Week. REED SELECTED BY CAUCUS. Congress Convenes, but Nothing but Pre liminaries Can Go Through In the House, While tho Senate May Do Kul I veiled by an Attempt nt KcorganUatlon Forecast For tho Week. Washington, Dec. 2. Tho first week of tho Fifty-fourth congress, which con vened at noon today, promises nothing at either end of tho Capitol in the way of actual legislation. Tho timo beforo tho Christmas holidays is usually do voted to preliminary matters and tho work of the session does not begin until after tho recess. Tho now congress will probably not bo an exception to this rule. Tho senate proceedings may bo enlivened by an attempt at reorganiza tion but in tho houso nothing can bo done until tho committees aro ap pointed. Speaker-elect Reed 6ays that tho com mittees will not bo announced this week with, perhaps, a singlo exception tho committee on rules. This committee formulates tho rules which aro to gov ern ho houso during its sessions, and it is customary for tho speaker to name it during tho first week in order that it can immediately begin its labors. While it is believed that the rules of the Fifty first congress, over which Mr. Reed pro sided, will bo reported as tho guidance of tho present house, it is understood that a fow changes will bo mado as a re sult of experience which aro designed to still further improve the houso ma chinery and tho facilitation of public business. $Mr. Kerr, clerk of tho last houso, will call the house to order. After tho roll call, the election of the officers nomi nated by the Republican caucus Satur day night, will occur and as soon as Mr. Reed is formally installed as speaker, tho drawing of seats, which is known as tho congressional "raffle," will follow. This is a somewhat tedious, but amus ing affair and will occupy tho remainder of tho afternoon. Tho reading of tho president's message will consume Tues day and at its conclusion the houso will probably adjourn until Thursday and on convening Thursday adjourn imme diately until Monday. Tho adjourn ments will continue probably until tho committees aro announced. This is tho program, but tho unexpected might oc cur, as it so often does in tho houso, if somo aspiring members should intro duce a sensational resolution and ask for its immediate consideration. I It is not probablo that tho first week I of congress will witness much serious effort at legislative work in the senato. If any should bo accomplished beyond tho receipt of tho president's message : and of tho recess nominations and tho introduction of bills tho session would I be an exception in tho history of the I senato. , In view of tho fact that tho message , will not be leceived until Tuesday tho proceedings of Monday will consist in the swearing iu of tho newly elected lliuiuucrg Ytnu iiiuy uu jucauiib uuu hid appointment of a committee to wait upon the president. Tho session will probably not continue beyond 1 o'clock when tho Republicans will meet in cau cus. Tho messago will bo read on Tues day and tho brief sessions of Wednes day and Thursday will bo devoted large ly to tho introduction of bills of which thero will be sororal hundred. Following precedents tho senate will adjourn on Thursday until tho follow ing Monday Ono or two brief execu tive sessions for the roferonco of nomi nations aro also among tho probabilities for tho week. If tho Republicans decido upon an ef fort to reorganize, as is now gonerally conceded, the Democrats will follow with a conference on Tuesday or Wednesday, at which thoy probably will decide upon a courso of action. It now appears probable that all three par ties will place candidates for presidont pro tern in the fiold, and in that ovent tho wj?ek will bo enlivened somewhat by a triangular contest for this and tho other offices of tho senato. Secretary of Caucus. Washington, Dec. 2. Tho statement published yesterday that Representative Ellis of Oiegon had defeated Mr. Hook er of New York for tho position of sec retary of tho Republican caucus is incor rect. Tho fact is that Mr. Hooker was tho successful caudidatofor tho position, being elected by a largo majority.

Philadelphia, Dec. 2. Tho multi murderer, H. H. Holmes, must hang un less tho supremo court grants an appeal. In tho court of Oyer and terminer Sat urday, Judge Arnold refused to grant tho prisoner, who was convicted on Nov. 2, of tho murder, in this city, on Sept. 2, 1804, of B. F. Piotzcl, a new trial, and sentenced tho murderer to death. Holmes, when ho came into court, looked careworn, and seemed to have lost that air of confidence which hrm clung to him throughout his orde-1. Court opened with a brief tilt between Judge Arnold and Lawyer Rotan, couo srl for tho defendant. Judge Arnold charged that Mr. Rotan had offered on insult to the court by sending brio fa to Presiding Judge Thayer and Jnd'ro Willson, who had sat with Judge Ar nold when Holmes' counsel had argued for a now trial, but had neglected to send him a copy. Mr. Rotan disclaimed any intcnt'on of insulting Judge Arnold, and pleaded haste as an oxcuso for having neglected to send him u brief. Judge Arnold then proceeded to rend tho court's answer to Holmes' counsel's reasons for a now trial. Ho took up tho 15 exceptions to the verdict, ono at a timo, and dwelt at length upon e.i'-h. Tho main reasons for a new trial, which wero put forth by tho defendant's coun- I sol, wcro tho admission of tho testimony of Miss Yoke, whom Holmes claimed as his lawful wife; tho district attor ney's opening speech to the jury, when he brought tho murder of tho children into tho case, and part of Mrs. Pietzol's testimony, in which she said tho ln-t timo she saw her children "was iu tho morgue at Toronto." Iu reference to Miss Yoko's eligibility as a witness, the judge said that it was the opinion of tho court that Holmrs was not only married to the Williumotto (Ills.) woman when ho wedded Miss Yoke, but that he also had a wife in Gilman, N. H. Therefore, tho mar riage to Miss Yoke was null and void, and tho evidence was admissible. i Tho opening speech of the district at torney, ho said, was not open to objec- , tion. It was the evident intention of Holmes, said Jtidpp Arnold, to take off 1 tl'o entire PMzol family in order to se- , cure property belonging to the murdered man. As to the statement of Mrs. Pietzel, tho judge bad instructed tho jury not to bo influenced bv tho woman's state nient: ho closed bv saying tliat tho court a liovcs tho vorii-t and rofnres a new trial. District Attorney Graham flien nroco and asked that sentence be pronounced. Holmes was ordered to stand up. Judge Arnold said: , "Herman W. Mudgetts, havo you any thing to say?" TTilmos replied in a barely audible vr if o: "I havo nothing to say." Judge Arnold then pronounced tho dith sentence in the usual form, after 1 nil Holmes was taken from th" v,rrt to prison. Governor Hastinf". will fix tho day of Holmes' execution. Am nppal to the puprenie court will be Liken at or.ee.
