MESSAGE OF WILSON president delivers a short ADDRESS to congress in JOINT SESSION. asks MORE RAILWAY LAWS Calls for Early Action on Remaining Measures of His Program of Settle ment and Regulation—Other Legis lation That Is Advised. Washington, I tec. 5. —President Wil son’s message, delivered to congress In Joint session today, was brief and to the iioiut. The president said; tientlenien of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid upon me by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to time Ji.' urination of the state of the Fniou and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures us may be judged necessary and expedient I -hull continue the practice, which I hope lias been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine myself to those matters of more general pub lic policy with which it seems neces sary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and sfihll make my sug gestions s few us possible; but there were some things left undone at the lust session which there will now he time to complete and which It seems necessary in the Interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your lust session fu view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended: First, Immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In tht‘ bill recently passed hy the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate; In order that the commission may he enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon It with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with tts present constitution and means of action, practically Impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day ns the legal basis alike of work and of wages ifi the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged in (he work of oper ating trains In Interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults In experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval hy the con gress of the consideration hy the in terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight rates to meet such Additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have Ijeen rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off set hy administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of (he existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies ns the present by adding to It a provision that. In case the methods of accommodation new provided for should fall, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall he Instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And. sixth, ’ the lodgment In the hands of the executive of the power. In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may he required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials ns the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. Renew* His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations tint congress Immediate ly acted cm: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages In train service and It au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed; but It postponed action upon .he other The Years After Fifty. When men pass the half-century mark, they usually regard themselves as going down hill. A discovery which 1 made by talking "with those who were really living in the latter period was that many of them regarded their experience of 1 ! n the advancing years as the best part of the whole. It did not appear on ■ •* surface; it was not any mark* ■. ticcess before the world, and it was ti ' appeal, foirhnps, to those In fh“ ■.rlter Ufa; tut many of those people suggestions until an opiiortuiiity should he offered for a more deliberate con sideration Of them. The fourth rec ommendation i do not deem It oeces sary to renew. The power of the In terstate commerce commission to grant an Increase of rates on the ground re ferred to Is Indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com mission’s authority dh its Inclination to do Justice when there Is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—tho Increase In the interstate commerce commis sion’s membership and in tts facilities for performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate tho rail ways when necessary In time of war or other lilee public necessity—l now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have Intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them In such matters would find It hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the Interstate com merce commission now find It practi cally Impossible, with Its present mem bership and organization, to perform Its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but It is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound Industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt ns to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues Its own case In the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its Items, the Increase In the effi ciency of ihe Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man In any occupa tion should be obliged hy law to con tinue in an employment which lie de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the Individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt anew prin ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I take It for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not he stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation Is not to propose any such principle. It Is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not he permitted to stop the In dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form Its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, an*. opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing In that proposition hut the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of Its very life. There Is nothing arbi trary or unjust In It unless It be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should he done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the Interests and liber ties of all concerned as well ns for the permanent interests of society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital Importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon hy the house of representatives: the bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged fn pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than Is now thought hy some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Illco; and the bill proposing more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money In elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies In the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. Kven delay would seriously Jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate the ex[etidlture of money In elec- told me they felt that they were liv ing the happiest (lay* of all. There seem* to he a mysterloua quality of life in these later years which Is not found In the earlier part, something that Is worth while In the living of it; and no one has had all of human life until he has been through *hese years and found it. Th-n. and not before. I came hack to the conviction that one who has at tained a half-century of clean, hottest living, is worthy of congratulation; that he ou,;ht to [;.*■ h - ti.tleth .an.i-

Action cun be taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand In the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those wno shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, lias indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. Wo have not the necessary Instrumen talities for Its prosecution; It Is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon uu adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for It which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity Is here and may escape us If we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico’s Needs. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the Island and regulating the rights and privileges of Its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among the people of the Island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them w hich the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do In any essential particular. We ought to do It nt once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which It Is not necessary that 1 should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch us this Is, gentlemen, prob ably the hist occasion 1 shall have to address the Sixty fourth congress, 1 hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor In such company. 1 take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare serviceableuess and distinction. That’s Right.

SHERIFF CHARGED WITH MISCONDUCT Kenosha County Official Sum moned Before Governor. FAILED TO MAKE AN ARREST Charge Is Made That Officer Did Not Honor Indiana Requisition and Failed to Explain His Act. Madison.—Charged with gross mis conduct and malfeasance in office, Sheriff A. Stahl of Kenosha comity, was ordered, In a precept Issued by Governor I'bllipp, to appear at a Inur ing In the executive chamber on Wednesday, December -0, t<> show cause why lie should not be removed from office. This executive action is based upon a petition by L. C. Whlttet, acting pri vate secretary to Governor Philipp, who alleges than on September -71, 1915, an executive warrant was issued, upon requisition by Gov. Samuel M. Ralston ot Indiana, for the arrest of I’eter Jansen, charged with child de sertion in (lit* Hoosler state. In Keno sha county. The warrant was forwarded to Sheriff Stahl with directions to make tin* arrest and report et once to the Indiana authorities. Sometime inter Governor Philipp received complaint from Governor Ralston of Indiana (hat the arrest bad not been made nor any reason given for failure by tin* Kenosha county sheriff. Stahl was at once notified by Governor Philipp of the complaint nml directed to execute the warrant promptly and make re port. On October 27 the Hoosler execu tive again complained of failure of Stahl to make tin* arrest or report and a third executive notice was forward ed to tin* Kenosha official and also to District Attorney Alfred 1.. Drury, calling attention to the delinquency and directing prompt action. A few days ago another complaint was re ceived from tin* Indiana executive. These alleged failures and refusals to report or make explanation are the basis of Air. Whlttet’s complaint. Governor to Aid Guardsmen. The upheaval among guardsmen over the enlistment clause which demands three years of reserve duty bus reached Gov. K. 1.. Philipp, who will ask Wisconsin congressmen to Intro duce and support a bill to relieve tin* men from tin* three-year reserve serv ice provision. Wisconsin is not (he only state In which objection Is being raised to the form of oath submitted by the federal government. The oath alters flu* conditions of previous enlistment contracts by pro viding that all troops shall remain three years In Ihe service. Adjt. Gen. Orlando llolwtiy In tin In terview with Governor Philipp pointed out that many of the guardsmen who signed the oath probably did not fully understand the agreement Into which they were entering. Because of this understanding General Hohvay be lieves that some step should be taken to relieve the men from ihe reserve clause. Governor Philipp bolds (he same view. Judging from the feeling that has developed In other slates over the matter, the corrective measure sag gested by Governor Philipp will have widespread hacking. Wisconsin will take the Initiative In Ihe movement to release guardsmen from flte three-year reserve provision and the governor feels certain that congress will give the subject fair hear ing. Liquor Fight Loom*. That a hot battle Is going lo be waged at the coming session of the legislature on the liquor question was Intimated when William T.
