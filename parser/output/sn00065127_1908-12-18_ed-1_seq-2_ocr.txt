', Abraham Ruef, former political boss ox aan Ifranclsco, was convicted Thurs day of bribery. The Verdict was re turned exactly upon the stroke 'of 4 o'clock, when the deliberations of the jury had been prolonged throughout a period of twenty-four hours. The warnings of Judge William P. Lawler and the vigilance of the police checked all attempted demonstration, although the excitement in the court room was so Intense that men were thrust down into their seats or held In the grasp of. detectives aa they rose to obtain a better view of the proceedings. The trial, which has been In progress 106 days, ended with surprising ab ruptness. The day had almost passed without a sign of Intimation from tht curtained chamber on tho upper floor of Carpenter's hall. The hope of Ruef and his attorneys had risen with every hour of delay, and the adherents of the prosecution were proportionately discouraged. With numbers and inter est undiminished, the hundreds of' spectators who have clung about the court room during the closing days of the trial retained their seats In the chamber or stood patiently In a long line opposite the entrance with a strong detail of police watching vigi lantly for the first sign of disorder In side and patroled every approach to the hall. The Jurors had scarcely tak en their seats In the box before the brief proceedings were at an end The Judge glanced at the verdict and handed It to Clerk Welch, who read It aloud. Attorneys, defendant, spectators, de tectives and police held their breath as the clerk slowly and deliberately, yet with apparent agitation, unfolded the paper, and then, as every eye In the court room was riveted upon him, read the fatal words: "We, the Jury, And the defendant, Abraham Ruef, guilty as charged.

HEAVY DEMAND FOR FUNDS. State Institution Will Press Hard on Treasury. Deep disappointment Is coming for the heads of the state Institutions at the coming legislative session. Their aggregate demands upon the state treasury will be for $1,000,000 for new buildings at the different institutions. In the last campaign the heavy ap propriations of the last session were defended on the ground that it was necessary t« provide new buildings for the many stato institutions, and that they had now been fitted out with buildings -.vhich would meet their de mands for several years. But the heads of the Institutions think differ ently. They want more, and want them now. The state university thinks it could get along for two years more if It were giVen $345,000 for that pur pose the agricultural college at Brookings will be satisfied with J1S5, 000, and the asylum for the feeble minded at Redfleld wants $127,000 more. The rest of them are willing to get along with from $100,000 down to smaller sums. ARRESTED FOR ROBBERY. Trio Enters a Store in Broad Daylight and Rifles Safe.

Novel Situation Exists in the Town of Miller. From a chief of police and three deputies Miller now has not a single officer to keep the peace. The discov ery was made when two young men were tried before Justice Heltlbrldle for resisting an officer. They went through one trial, the Jury disagree ing, and had started on their second when they were dismissed because it was found that the officer whom they were charged with resisting had never been legally qualified as such, and It was supposed by even the mayor and lawyers up to this time that he was a qualified officer. When the case against the boys wfis dismissed the deputy policemen resigned. In the absonce of any police authority the mayor has requested the sheriff of the county to keep a lookout for any dis turbance that may arise Until a new marshall or chief of police may be ap pointed.

This is the question which is agitat ing some of the residents of that part of Gregory county which is tributary to the "Riff Muddy." The mysterious dlsapearance of three persons in the course of a few months, who were known to have large sums of money in their possession when last seen alive, has given rise to the belief that the missing men were murdered and rob bed. after which their bodies were hidden, either by being burled In the siround at some remote point, or by bcinf{ weighted down and thrown into the Missour river. It is only a few months ago that "Tod" McPherson, a well known farmer of Honhomme county, disap peared. He had gone to the west side of the river with a large sum in cash in his possession for tha pur pose of purchasing a herd of cattle. Soon after reaching the west side of the river he disappeared, and from that day to this not the slightest trace him has been found.

PIERRE State Historian Doane Robinson has Issued his eighteenth annual review of progress of the state, which covers jn its range the growth of population, bank deposits and all subjects of ma terial prosperity of the state, along with more or less political history. The summary shows that the produc tion of the farms, ranches, mines and quarries of the state have shown an increase of $25,000,000 over the figures of last year, bringing the total for this year to $185,434,460. Bank deposits show more certainly than any other figures what tho people have been do ing in the way of material prosperity In the past 10 years, growing from $10,104,135 in 1898 to $68,832,899 in 1908. These figures are not swelled through the deposits of banks outside of the state, but show tho deposits of the people. The bank figures of the states farther east are swelled through the deposits of South Dakota banks, but none of their cash comes to this state to be deposited. Census figures, based on the school population, with the same ratio as was shown in the census of 1905, shows a gain in popula tion of 53,000. Stanley county shows an increase of 17,649 on that basis, the heaviest gain of any county in the state. While all of the new counties of the western and northern part of the state show gains, a number of the older counties show a loss. Complaint has been made by the sheriff of Lawrence county against the officials of the state insane hospital at Yankton for what he terms the neg lectful methods In connection with the receiving of patients from I^awrensc county committed through due pro cess of law to the asylum. Sheriff Tra thon charge that in several Instances patients have been permitted to re main In the county Jail at Deadwood for weeks after their official commit ment to the asylum and the notifica tion of the proper authorities, and that the authorities there have not the proper facilities for caring for the mentally deranged, who consequently suffer. In connection with this charge he cites the fact that Lawrence county is paying over $10,000 per year for the care of its insane in the state asy lum, the largest amount paid by any county in the state. Although vast quantities of jfrain 'ire being sent to market from South Dakota, there has thus far been scarcely a complaint In reference to car shortages. Last season the eleva tor men of the 6tate were greatly handicapped by a car shortage, and In numerous Instances It was necessary for them to cease buying grain tem porarily until cars could be provided for the hauling away of the grain with which the elevators were congested. This season the railroads appear to have an ample number of grain cars for their lines In South Dakota and grain has been kept moving. Millions of dollars are being brought into tho state in payment for the immense quantities of grain now being sent in a never ending stream to the big mar ket points.

The company pumps the water the rest of the way into a tank for its use. The well has been a difficult one to drill on account of the rock formation lying at a slharp slant, forcing the drill to one side all the way down after rock was found. State Engineer Lea Is Interesting himself in the proposition of the gen eral government to duplicate any sum appropriated by the different states to carry on geological survey work, to assist in the development of the natur al resources of the states. Many of the states are accepting the proposi tion and appropriating sflms ran from $1,000 to $12,000. The govern ment puts in the same amount and the work is pushed as far as the ap propriation will carry it. The smaller sum will not go far but will get the work started In the state to be pushed further in after years. Gov.
