TOBACCO INDUSTRY BECOMES BIG REVENUE PRODUCER, ROPER S/4 YS IN REPORT Washing ton, Dec. 5. —Estimates of $6,000,000,000 as the yield of the present revenue law for the first twelve months of its operation will be closely approached if not fully realized, Internal Revenue Commis sion Roper said In his unnual report. Payments of the first two install ments, March 15 und Juno 15, brought Into the Treasury a total of $2,600,783,000, Mr. Roper said, while reports already In hand of the third Installment payable Sept. 15, fully support the bureau's estimate. Commissioner Roper said the to bacco Industry had developed Into one of the greatest sources of FcU erul revenue, the total receipts from this source alone for the fiscul year ending June 30, 1919, being $206,- 003,660, an increase of $4 8,800,000 over tboso of tho preceding year. More Cigars Smoked An onormous Increase In the num ber of cigaretes manufactured was shown by the reports, the total for tho last fiscal year being approxi mately eight times larger than in 1910. In that year, 8,500,000,000 cigaretes and 8,000,000,000 cigars wero manufactured, while in the last fiscal year tho manufacture of ciga retes had increased to 46,500,000,- 000 while the number of cigars re mained practically stationary. Discussing constitutional prohi bition, Mr. Roper said that probably 50,000,000 gallons of spiritous liquors would remain In bonded warehouses when the constitutional amendment becomes effective Janu ary 16. During the year ended June 30, approximately 99,000,000 gallons of distilled liquor were produced from Will Ask Early Consideration of the Peace Resolution Washington, Dec. 5. —A joint reso lution declaring the 'war with Ger- , many "at an end" waa introduced j yesterday by Representative Tink-j ham, Republican, Massachusetts, j He indicated he had acted at the: suggested of Republican leaders In I the Senate and said he would ask [ early consideration by the Foreign j Affairs Committee. House lenders said they had no ! plans for action 011 the resolution. ' The text of the Tinkham resolu- i tion follows: "Whereas, the. resolution of Con- j gross adopted April 6, 1917, by rea- ( son of acts committed by the then ! German government a state of war j was declared to exist between that j government and the United States, j and. j "Whereas, the said acts of war of I the German government have long since ceased, and, "Whereas, hostilities between I Germany and the allied and asso- j elated powers have terminated; "Now therefore, be it, "Resolved by the Senate and s House and Representatives of the j United States in Congress assembled, j "That the said war between Ger-1 many and the United States is here- | by declared to be at an end." 

FINED FOR NEAR BEER SALES Oil City. Pa-, Dec. s.—Twenty- j three persons were fined $2," each at: Cambridge Springs, when they were found guilty of selling near beer al leged to contain more than one-half of 1 per cent alcohol. | i materials other than fruits, this figure representing a decrease of nearly 75,000,000 gallons from the ' previous year's production. Tho efTect of wartimo prohibition has presented a problem which is causing revenue officials "serious em barrassment," Mr. Roper said. Holders of heavy stocks of liquor in bond were forced, under provisions 1 of the last revenue act, to pay an additional tax Sept. 15. The law i closing the saloons for the period of , - the war has left those interests with . | their products and without means ■ j of obtaining money to make the tax ■ ' payments, he said. Many Drugs Smuggled. "Under the law the discretion of ■ the bureau is limited to extending the time for payment of these taxes i seven months." Mr. Roper explained. "Serious embarrassment lias re sulted as to the course of action which should be taken in these l cases to protect the interests of the • Government without imposing un ■ due financial hardships on the tax i payers which presumably were not I Intended by Congress." i The report revealed a menace in : Illegitimate traffic in drugs between this country and Canada and Mexico. Mr. Roper urged that some temporary arrangement be estab lished which would put a stop to this smuggling. Expenditures of the bureau dur i lng the last fiscal year, Mr. ltoper said, were $20,573,771, an increase [I of $12,003,214 over the previous fiscal year. On this basis, he said, it had cost the Government 0.543 , I per cent to administer the revenue I j laws and collect the second greatest i l tax bill the Nation ever has laid. —— Cummins Charges Misrepresentation of His Railroad Bill Wa-liiiurton. Dee. s.—After speak j iag three days, Senator Cummins, I chairman of the Interstate Com j meree Committee, concluded late ' yesterday a detailed explanation of t his railroad bill, designed to meet I conditions with the return of the j roads to private ownership and con | trol. j Discussing the anti-strike provi ! sion of the measure, as proposed by the committee. Senator Cummins de -1 elared "there had been an indus j trious effort to misrepresent the > bill," He denied that it interfered j in any way with railway employes ! or officials who desired to quit work. Emphasizing that he was not op ! posed to labor organizations, Sen -1 ator Cummins said the committee, ! in inserting the anti-strike section felt 1 that "the civilization of America ; cannot continue or endure unless 5 organized society can find some plan i to preserve industrial peace and or- I der." President Wilson's message 'to Congress Tuesday, he declared, j was a direct endorsement of the pro | posed legislation. Mexican Consul at El Paso Denies the Capture of Villa j I'll I'aso, Texas, Dec. s.—Andres ! Garcia, consul general here for Mex ico, received a telegram from mili tary headquarters at Chihuahua City yesterday which said that the re ported capture of Francisco Villa t near Parral was not true. 1 GET 

AMERICANS OUT OF MEXICO Sonic Concerns of the States Prepare to Bring Their Men to the Border El l*aa<>, the, Ft, —Cailain American cancmna operating in Mexico ordered tlielr border repre sentatives (o prepare for getting their American ctnpioyeo out of Mexico, tn some oanctj tiio definite insf ructions were given for im mediate withdrawal of American eajployera from Mexico, Hut nets t'< these companies were ytiibhcld because of the possible danger, it yttut said, to their em ployes in quitting the southern re pu biie. Danger to A men cans in Mexico, should diplomatic relations between the two eountrios be broken off, lias been seriously discussed on the border in connection with the Jenkins coso. It was felt that an order front the government such as j was issued by President Taft in 1912 ordering Americans to quit Mexico, would create an ill-feeling south of iiut border and might cause blood shed. The problem hi gelling the Ameri cans out of Mexico should diplo matic relations be broken, would be a difficult one, according to their employers, for they Are scattered throughout the country and many gre great, distances from railroads and telegraph lines, Pompanies preparing to get I heir employes home hesitated to-day (o permit publication of their inten tions, Then it was decided that the situation appeared so critical that notice of their action might point tlie way to safety to other Ameri cans in the interior. Should a resolution breaking oft relations be passed, it was said that there would be a general exodus of Americans to the United States. Argentine Watching the Situation Between America and Mexico ! Buenos Aires. Argentine, Dec. 5. — While the rumors of an offer of mediation by the A. B. C. powers | (Argentina, Brazil and Chile) to settle the difficulties between the United States and Mexico lack con firmation, it is known that the Ar gentine government is closely watch ing the situation and that the fofeign office is keeping fully in formed of the developments through the Argentine envoys in Washington and Mexico City. It is much ques tioned in diplomatic circles whether, If action towards mediation is to bo taken by any of the South American governments, it should be joint ac tion by the A. B. C. powers, inns much as the proposal for an A. B. C. accord which followed the Ni agara Falls conference of 1914 lias never been ratified and it is not be lieved that this principle could now be appropriately invoked.
