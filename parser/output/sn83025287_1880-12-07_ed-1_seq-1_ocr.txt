VOL. in. i LASTMESSAGE. MR HAYES SPEAKS HIS MIND Before His Final Retirement From Official Place. TRIES TO MAKE HIMSKLF SOLID With the Xegrophobists and Imperial ists of His Part j*; TALKS CIVIL SERVICE REFORM To Hold the Good Will of the Late Selmrz-Hayes Faction: AGREES WITH ALL HIS CABINET Upon All Sorts of Subjects and All Recommendations, AND EXCITES LOYAL GRATITUDE Of the People that He Accepted the Cilice For Only One Term. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our country. By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during the past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profit able employment for all our people and with contentment at home and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of achief magistrate has afforded another oppor tunity to the people of the United States to ex hibit to the world a significant example of tbe transmission of the power and authority of the government from public servants, whose terms of office are about to expire, to their newly chosen suc cessors. This example cannot fail to impress profoundly tbe thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which republi can institutions afford. The immediate, gen eral and cheerful acquiescence of all good citi zens in tho result of the election gives gratify ing assurance to our country and its friends throughout the world that the government based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses elements of strength, stability and permanency, not found in any other form of government. SUFCTAGE. Continued opposition to the full and free en joyment of the rights of citizenship conferred upon colored people by the recent amendments to the constitution, still prevails in several of the late slave-holding States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested iu the recent election to any large extent by acts of violence or intimi dation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac- ' tices in connection with ballots, with regula tions as to the places and manner of voting and with counting the returns and canvassing the | '• votes cast, been successful in defeating j ] the exercise of the right preservative of all rights, tbe right of suffrage, which the cnusti- 1 tution expressly confers upon our enfrf.'_i.hi*ed < citizens. It is the desire of good people of the i whole country that sectionalism as a fact or in politics should disappear. They prefer that ' no section of the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse prompt and hearty obedience to the equal rights amendments to the consti tution is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments iB flagrantly violated or disre garded it is safe to assume that tbe people who placed them in the constitution as embodying the legitimate results of the war for the Un ion, or who believe them to be wise and neces sary, will continue to act together and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The parmount question, still is as to the enjoyment of the right by every American citizen who baa tbe requisite qalifi cations to freely cast his vote, and have it hon estly counted. With this question rightly set tied the country will be assured the conten tions of past bygones will indeed be by gones, and political and party issues with re spec to economy and efficiency of administra tion, internal improvements, the tariff, domes tic taxation, education, finance and other im portant subjects will then receive I! > ir full chare of attention. But resistance to and nullification of the results of the war w ill unite together in resolute purpose for their support, all who maintain the authority of the gevernment and the perpetuity of the Union and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This deter mination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rest npon the fundamental principles of our govern ment. They are the solemn expressions of the will of the people of the United States. The sentiment that tbe constitutional rights of all our citi zens must be maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the government of the country. Happily, the history of the late election shows that in many parts of the conn try where opposition to the fifteenth amend ment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminish ing, and is likely to cease altogether if firm and well considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of tbe elections, returns and qualifications of their own members, will see to it that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of tbe fifteenth amendment is thorough ly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the executive, with suf ficient appropriations for tbe purpose, to prose cute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. It is not.however.to be forgotten that the best and surest guarantee of the primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self-protection, which can only belong to a peo ple whoso right to universal suffrage is sup ported by personal education. The resources at the command of local and State authorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is < specially true, where before emancipation the rd 11 cation of the people was neglected or pre vented in the interests of slavery. I am firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves tho earnest attention of the people of this country, with a view to wise and compre hensive action by tho government of the United States. I respectfully recommend that Congress by suitable legisla tion and with proper regulations supplement tbo local educational funds in tbe several States where the grave duties and responsibili ties of citizenship have been devolved on un educated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and if necessary, by appropriations from the treasury of the United States ; what else the government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general education iB found peace, virtue and social order prevail and civil and reiieious liberty are secured, OITTL SERVICE BKIOEM. In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent neces sity of a reformation of tbe civil service sys tem of the government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage or appointment for personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and expe rience in tbe executive office.and I believe these dangers threaten the stability of the govern ment. Abuses bo serious in then* nature can not be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of the administrative seivice, as the growth of tbe country in population increases the num ber of officers and placemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promotions and removals by establishing a uniform method having exclusively in view in every instance the attainment of best quali fications for the position in question. • Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of .all citizens and the most economical and ef ficient administration of the public business. Competitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and promotions have been con noted for some years past in several of the x eoutive departments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in the custom houses and postofficea of the larger cities of i the country. In New York city over 2,000* po sitions in the civil service have been subject in their appointments and tenure of place to the operations - of .the published rules for this purpose the past two years. The results of these practical trials have been very, satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of the system of selection. All are subjected to' the same tests and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It se cures for the position applied for tbe best qualifications attainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from the pressure of importunity, which, under any other course pursued, largely exacts the time and attention of appointing officers, to their great detriment in the discharge ' of other official duties. It prevents the abuse of the service for the mere f urtherence of private or party purposes and leaves the employe of the government, freed from the obligations imposed by patronage, to depend solely on merit for retention and advancement, and with this constant incentive to advancement and improvement. These invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the offices where the rules for appointment by competi tive examination have been applied. As shown by experimental trial it may ba fairly considered conclusive that tne system should be extended to all subordinate positions undor tbe government. I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing and enforcing the highest positive efficiency in the civil service and its protection from recognized abuses, and that the experience referred to has demon strated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in custom houses and postoffises have been held under many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor performed by the office; s who have conducted them, and whose commendable interest in improvement of the public service has induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to bo ex pected, and without an appropriation by Congress for compensation it iB not practicable to extend the system of examination throughout the civil service. It iB highly important that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and nnder general supervision. Section 1,753 of the revised statutes authorizes the President to prescribe the regulations for admission to the civil service of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to son sider the requisite inquiries with reference to the fitness of each candidate in respect to age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter, but the law is practically inoperative for the want of requisite appropriations. Therefore, I recommend an ap propriation of $25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a commission to be appointed by the President, in accordance with the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and efficient system of competitive examination and to su pervise the application of the same through out the entire oivil service of the government. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford; for testing the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members of Con gress as it will be to the President and heads of departments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment which now inevitably and con stantly attend the conflicting claims of patron age between the legislative and executive de- ' partments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of influence and offi cial favoritism in the bestowal of office, will be the substitution of an open competition of ' merit between the applicants, in which every ' one can make his own record with the assurance that his success will depend upon this alone. I also recommend such legislation, as, while leaving every officer free as any other citizen to express bis political opinions, and to use his ■ means for their advancement, shall also enable ' him to feel as safe as any private citizen in re- ' fusing demands an his salary for. political pur- ' poses. A law which "'lonld thus guarantee true I liberty and j'-o . Z :.. -i -ho are engaged in ' the public service, and likewise contain string ent provisions against the use of official author ity to coerce the political action of private cit izens or of official subordinates, is greatly to be desired. T, . . V :>":.'-"'*2'■■ "''"• i The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of civil service, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal, has been found to be tbe practice un der what is known as the spoils system, by which the appointing power has been bo largely encroached on by members of Congress. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and the executive in the matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine that "to the victor belong the spoils" is inseparable from Congres sional patronage. As the established rule and practice of parties in power it comes to be un derstood by applicants for offices and by the people generally that Representatives and Sen ators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts and States. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this perversion of the executive func tions. The true principles of government on the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the national conventions of the leading par ties of the country, have again and again been approved by the American people and have not been called in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all important subject are the state - ment of principles that belong to the consti tutional structure of the government. I Under the constitution, the President and heads of departments are to make nominations for of fice, the Senate is to confirm the appointments and the House of Representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best interest of the public service demands that these distinctions be respected, and that Sena tors and Representatives who may be judges and accusers should not dictate appointments to office. To this end " the cooperation of the legislative department of the government is required, alike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with reference to appointments to office until by legislative enactment tbe per nicious practice iB condemned and ferbidden. It is, therefore. recommended that an act be passed defining the re lations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to office by the President, and I also recommend that tbe provisions of section 1767 and of the sections following of the revised statutes, comprising the term-of-office act of March 2, 1867, be re pealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our coun-. try is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship and that it can be permanently done only by the co-operation of the legislative and executive depart ments of the government, I again commend tbe whole subject to your considerate atten tion. ■ ■'%"■/'" 

POLYGAMY. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress poly gamy where it now exists in Utah Territory and to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States officers in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy, has the whole power of making and executing the local legislation of the Territory. By its control of the grand and petit jurors it possesses large influence over the administration of jus tice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the laws of Congress [the subjeet of polygamy and in fact do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of law depends those who practice and up hold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political pov^er of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The powers of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not a case for half-way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous Ter ritories. It is extending steadily into other Territories. Wherever it goes it estab lishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and family relations are the corner stones of j American society and ! civilization. Religious liberty and the separ ' ation of church and state are among the ele mentary ideas of free institutions. Tore-es ; tablish the interests and principles which po : lygamy and Mormon ism have imperilled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous im migrants of all other creeds the Territory i closed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions,- it is recommended that the government of the Territory of Utah should be -. reorganized. I recommend that ' Congress provide for the government of Utah • by a governor and judges' or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by i the Senate government analogeous to - tbe provisional government established for the - territory northwest of Ohio . ' by the ordinance of 1787.. If, however, it is - deemed beat to continue the existing local i form of government I recommend that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in . the Territory of Utah be confined to those who ! neither practice nor uphold polygomy. If Ml 111 >: 4 1 I liiWnSSs 11 II I I Ir thorough measures are adopted it is believed that within a few years the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and this Terri tory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new States of the Union. ~ '^fs ~ > y^& :;;; ~^ /';'* , FOREIGN REIUTIONa. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace and have pre sented no occasion for concern as to their con tinued manintenance. My anticipation of an early reply from the British government to the demand of indemnity to our fishermen for injuries suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay in January,'; 1S7S; which I expressed in my last annual . message, was disappointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and when received exhibited a failure of accord between the two governments as to the measure of the inshore fishing privileges secured to our fisher men by the treaty of Washington, of so serious a oharacter that I made it the subject of a communication to Congress in which I recommended the adoption of meas ures which f coined to me proper to be taken ty this government in maintenance of the rights scctrded to our fishermen under the treaty and toward securing an indemnity for the injury these interests bad suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under consideration by the House of Rep resentatives at the time of the adjournment of Congress in June last. • Within a few weeks I have received a com munication from her majesty's government re viewing the consideration of [the subject, both of the indemnity for injuries at Fortune Bay and of the interpretation of the treaty, in which the previous correspondence had shown the two governments to be at variance. Upon both these topics the disposition towards a friendly Agreement is manifested by a it-cognition of our right to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity to further confer ence and by an assent to the views of this gov ernment, presented in a previous correspond ence, that the regulation of conflicting inter ests of the shore fishing of the provincial eea coasts and the vessel fishing of our fishermen should be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two gov ernments. I sincerely hope that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of views in the inter pretation of the fishery clause of the treaty of Washington, which, as the correspond ence between the two governments stood at the close of the last session of Con gress seemed to be irreconcilable, g In the important exhibition of arts and in dustries which was held last year at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at Melbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably represented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments, and the participation of the United States was recognized by a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our oountry is no less notable, and an equal degree cf success is confidently expected. The state of peace and tranquility now en joyed by all the nations of the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have concluded and ratified a convention with the French republic for settlement of the claims of citizens of either country against tbe other. Under this convention, a commission, presided over by a distinguished publicist, ap pointed in pursuance of tbe request of both nations by his majesty the emperor of Brazil, has been organized and has begun its sessions in this city. -■„.■"- A Congress to consider means for the protec tion of industrial prosperity has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers of the United States in France and Belgium as delegates. The constitutional commissions upon weights and measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your atten tion to the necessity of appropriations to be made in time to enable this government to ful fill its obligations tinder tbe metrical conven tion. Our friendly relations with tbe German em pire continue without interruption. At the recent international exhibition of fish and fisheries at Berlin the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the baste in which the commissi' was forced to make preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning private exhibitors nu merous awards of high class, and for the coun try at large, the principal prize of honor offered by bis majesty the emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this important and growing industry. There have been some questions raised between the two governments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of nat uralization, but recent -dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that favorable progress is making toward an understanding in accordance with the views of this govern ment, which makes and admits no distinction whatever between tbe rights of a native and a naturalization citizen of tbe United States. In practice the complaints of molestations suf fered by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer. , There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relations with the govern ments of Austria, Hungary, Russia, Portugal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. rt<il> During the last summer several vessels be longing to the merchant marine of this coun try sailing in natural waters of the West Indies were fired at, boarded and searched by an armed cruiser of ' the Span ish government. The circumstances, as reported, involve not only private injury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too little observant of the friendly relations exist ing for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the atten tion of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royal authori ties, with a view to such explanation or repara tion as may be called for by the facts. The commission sitting in this city for the adjudi cation of claims of oar citizens against the government of Spain is, I hope, approaching the termination of its labors. The claims against the United States under the Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to Congress for its action at the late session. I again invite your attention to this long stand ing question, with a view to a disposition of the matter. At invitation of the Spanish government a conference has recently been held at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection by foreign powers of native' Moors in tbe em pire of Morocco. The minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of this conference, the result of which is a convention signed ou behalf of the powers represented. The instrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. The government of the United States has also lost no opportunity to urge upon that of the emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accord ance with the humane and established spirit of the age, of putting an end to the persecu tions which have been so potent in that'coun try of persons of a faith other than Moslem and especially of Hebrew residents of Mo rocco. The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not been yet officially promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the Senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowed for ratification expired. . Tho Senate will be asked to extend the period for ratification. The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra dition with Denmark failed, on account of the objection of the Danish government to the clause providing that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest of persons whose ex tradition it makes. The provision made by Congress at its last session for the " expense of the commission which had been appointed to enter upon nego tiations with the imperial government of China, on a subject of great interest to the two countries, enabled the commissioners to proceed at once upon their mission. The imperial - government was prepared to give - prompt and respectable attention to the matters . brought under negotiation and the conferences proceed ed with such rapidity and success that on the 17th of November last two treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating to the introduction of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescott, one of the commis sioners, is now on his way, bringing the treat ies and it is expected that they will be receiv ed in time to be laid before the Senate early in January. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a con vention|for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked persons. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress the propriety of making provisions for the erection of suitable fire proof buildings at the Japanese capital for the use of the American legation and the court house and jail connected with it. The Japanese government with great generosi ty and courtesy has offered for the purpose an eligible piece of land. In my last annual message I invited the at tention of Congress to the subject of the in demnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. I renew the recommenda tion then made that whatever portions of these funds are due to American citizens should bo promptly paid and the residue re ! turned to the nations respectively to which they justly and equitably belong. The extradition treaty with the kingdom of !' the Netherlands, which has been for some time 

SAINT PAUL TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7 1880. ——: —"—•' — —::., • ■</_' in course of negotiation, has, during the past year, been concluded and duly ratified. v - .»:'*' . Relations of friendship and amity have been established between the ' government of the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest and have received at this capital the special envoy, who has been charged by His Royal Highness Prince Charles, to 'announce the j in dependent sovereignty of Roumania, and we hope for a speedy development of commercial; relations between the two countries. In my last annual message I expressed j the hope thatf tae prevalence of quiet on the border between this country and Mexico, would soon become so assured as to - justify the modifica tion of the orders then in force, to our | mili tary commanders in regard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging such distur bances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. Events moved in accordance with" these expectations and the orders I were accord ingly withdrawn to tho entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the Mexican government. Subsequently tbe peace of the border was again disturbed by a savage foray under the command of the Chief Viotbria. but by the con tinned and harmonious action of tbe military forces of botu countries, bis band baa been broken and substantially destroyed. There ie reason to believe that tho obstacles which have'' so long prevented rapid and convenient com munication between the United States ant- Mexico by railways are on the point of disap pearing and that several important enterprises of this character will soon beset on foot.; which can not fail to contribute largely to th-J prosperity of both countries. . - ■'"■;* New envoys from Outamala, Colombia, Bolivia,Venezuela and Nicuragua have recently arrived at this capital, whose distinction an& enlightenment afford the best guarantee of tbe continuance of friendly relations between ocx * selves and these sister Republics. ;| 

INTER-OCEANIC! CANAL. ' • f The relations between this government and that of the United States of Columbia have Ow* gaged public attention during the past ■ year, mainly by reason of tha project of an inter oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama tS 1 be built by private capital, under a concession f rom the Columbian government for that pur pose. The treaty obligations subsisting b«A tween the United States of Columbia and the United States, by which we guarantee the I nutrality of Che transit and the sovereignty' and property of Columbia in the Isthmus/ make it necessary that the conditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in this guar-' an tee should be —transforming, as ir would, this isthmus from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, for the navies and merchant ships of the world-should receive the approval of this government, as being com patible with the discharge of these obligation on our part, and consistent wit I" our interests as tbo principal com mercial power of the western hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a special mes sage to Congress in Mareh last, in relation tw. this project, I deem it my duty again to press on your attention. Subsequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion that it is the right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the IsthmnV that connects North and 8uuth America, and a? wall protect our national interest. ' ■''■ The war between the republic of Chill;'" on the one band and the allied republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues. This government has not felt called on to inter fere in a contest that is within the belligerent rights of the parties as independent States. We have, however, always held selves it. readiness to aid in accommodating their differ-, ence and have at different times reminded botB belligerents of our willingness to render suet. vices. Our good officers in this direction" were recently accepted by all the belligerents, and it was hoped they would proved efficacious. But I regret to announce that the* measures which the ministers of the United States at Santiago and Lima wero authorized to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not successful. In the course of the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all of the»e the ministers of the United States have, under their instruction?, acted with promptness and energy in protec tion of American interests. The relations of the United States with the* empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily in creases, to their mutual advantage. Tbe internal disorders with whioh the Argen tine Republic has for some time past bee-* afflicted,- and which' have, more - or less;'influ^ enced its external trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result may be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that republic, as well as to the development of its vast interior re sources. '.",.- :'vS In Samoa the government of King Malietoa . under the support and recognition of the con sular repesentativea of the United States,Great Britain and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquility to the islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of a tripartite local government whioh has been proposed, the common : in terests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in their true relations to the native frame of government and this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic agreement be tween them. It would be well if the consular jurisdiction of our representative at Topia were increased in extent and importance, so as to guard American interests in the surrounding and outlying islands of Oceanica. The obelisk generously presented by the khedive of Egypt to the city of New York has safely arrived in this country, and will soon be erected in that metropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this government at the earnest solicitation of the khedive has acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will be laid before Congress for its information. A commission for the revision of the judicial coda of the reform tribunaljof Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman, consul general, and J. M. Batchelder, Esq., have been appoint ed as commissioners to participate in this work. Tbe organization of the reform tribunals will probably be continued for another period of five years. SANITABY CONFERENCE. In pursuance of the act passed at the last session of Congress, invitations have been ex tended to foreign maritime states to join in a sanitary conference in Washington, beginning the 1st of January. The acceptance of this in vitation by many prominent 'powers gives promise of success in thia important measure designed to establish a system of international notification by which the spread of infections or epidemic diseases may be more effectively counteracted or prevented. The? attention of Congress is invited to the necessary appropria tions for carrying into effect the provisions of the act referred to. ' OUB COMMERCE. The efforts of the department of state to en large the trade and commerce of the United States through the active agency of consular officers and through the dissemination of in formation obtained from them, have been unre laxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed in our commercial com munities , and the value of tho in formation secured by this means to the trade and manufacturers of the country, were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication of consular and other reports by the department of state. The first issue of this publication has now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected. The importance and interest attached to the reports of consular officers are witnessed by the general demand for them by all classes of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed that the system of such publication is deserving of the ap proval of Congress and that the necessity of appropriations for its continuance and en largement will commend itself to your con sideration. The pursuit of domestic industrious and their immense production of subjects of for eign commerce . invite and even require an active development of the wishes and inter ests of our people in that - direction. Espec ially important is it that our commercial rela tions with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico, should be direct and not not through a circuit of the European systems, and should be carried on id our own bottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East In dies, with Australia and the island groups which belong to these routes of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appro riate to our own interest and administer to our own capital a due portion of. this trade. Whatever modification of our method of trade and navi gation may be necessary or useful to meet and direct to the enlargement of our exchange and our carrying interest, I am sure members of Congress will bs ready to supply.. One initial measure, however, seems to me bo clearly use ful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earliest attention. It seems to j be very evident tbat the provision of jj regular steam post communication by aid from governments has been the forerunner of the commercial prominence of Great : Britain in all the sea coasts, and these coasts and seas, a greater share of whose trade is now the desire < and in tent of onr people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European nations to con • tend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce has been successful in Droportion to their adoption of regular steam postal com munication with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and the Btatea of South America are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country and to aid in their development. Similar co-operation, may bo looked for in due time from the east ern nations and from Australia. It in difficult to see ho;v the lead in that movement can be expected from private inter ests in respect of foreign commerce. Quite as much, an international trade postal communication seems necessarily a matter of common and public administration, and thus pertaining to the government. I re spectfully recommend to your prompt atten tion suoh just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of onr foreign commercial exchanges, and the building up of our carrying trade. In this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service which might be expected in enlarging and facilitating onr commerce on the Pacific oceau were a transmarine cable laid from Han Francisco to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north tind Australia at the south. The great iofluen.ee of such means of communication on these xoutes of navigation in developing and securing the due share of our Pacific coast in the commerce of the world, needs no interpretation or en forcement. It may be that such an enterprise is useful and in the end profitable, as it would prove to private investmsnt, may need to be accelerated by prudent legislation by Gongresß in its aid; and I submit the matter to your careful consideration. An additional and not unimportant although seenndary reason for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in the unquestionable service to the expansion of our commerce, which would be rendered by the frequent cir culation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe. Ships of the pro per construction and equipment" to be of the greatest efficiency in case of maratlme war might be made constant and active agents in time of peace in the advancement and protection of onr foreign trade and in the nurture and discipline of young seamen who would naturally in some numbers mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Onr merchants at home and abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an \ active movement of our na val vessels, and tbe intelligence and patriotic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every in terest of their countrymen is a just subject of natural pride. THE FINAXCEE. The condition of tbe financial affairs of the government, as shown by the report of the secretary of the treasury, is very satisfactory. It is believed that the present financial situa tion of the United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and variety of our re sources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and |has never been surpassed by any other country at any period of its his tory. All our industries are thriving. The rate of interest is low; new railroads are being constructed; a vast immigration is increasing our population, capital and labor; new enter prises in great number are in progress, and our | commercial relations with other countries are improving. The ordinary revenues, from all sources, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, were: From customs $186,522,064 60 From internal revenue 124,009,373 92 From sales of public lands 1,016,506 60 From tax on circulation and de posits of national banks 7,014,971 44 From repayment of interest by Pacific railway companies... 1,707,367 18 From sinking fund for Pacific railway companies 786,62122 Fr Jin customs fees, fined, pen alties, etc J, 148,800 16 From fees—consular, letters patent and lands 2,337,029 00 From proceeds of sales of gov ernment property 282,616 50 From profits on coinage, etc.... 2,792,186 78 From revenues of the District of Columbia 1,809,469 70 From miscellaneous sources 4,099,603 88 Total ordinary receipts $333,526,610 98 The ordinary expenditures for the same peri od were: For civil expenses $ 15,693,963 55 For foreign intercourse 1,211,490 58 For Indians 5,945,457 09 For pennons, including $19,341, --025.20 arreais of pensions 56,777,174 44 For the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements and arsenals.. 38,116,916 22 For the naval establishment, in cluding vessels, machinery, and improvements at navy yards 13,536,984 74 For miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, lighthouses, and collecting the revenue 34,535,691 00 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 3,272,384 63 For interest on the public debt. 95,757,575 11 For premium on bonds pur chased 2,795,320 42 Total ordinary expenditures..s2o7,642,9s7 78 Leaving a surplus revenue of..s 65,883,653 20 Which, with an amount drawn from cash balance in treas ury, of 8,084,434 21 Making $73,968,087 41 Was applied to the redemption— Of bonds for the sinking fund.. 73,652,900 00 Of fractional currency for the sinking fund 251,717 41 Of the loan of 1858 40.0C0 00 Of temporary loan 100 00 Of bounty land scrip 25 00 Of compound-interest notes 16,500 00 Of 7.30 notes of 1864-5 2,650 00 Of one and two-year notes 3,700 00 Of old demand notes 495 00 Total $73,968,087 41 The amount due the sinking fund for this year was $37,931,613.55. There was applied thereto the sum of $73,904,617.41, being $35,982,97286, an excess of the actual requirements for the year. The aggregate of revenues from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was $333,526,610.98, an increase over the proceeding year of $59,699,426.52. The receipts thns far of the current year together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to $330,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures of the year, and leave a surplus of $90,000,000. It is fortunate that this large surplus of rev enues occurs at a period when it may be ap plied to the payment of the public debt soon redeemable. No public duty has been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as rapid ly as possible. The debt of the United States, less cash in the treasury, and exclusive of accruing interest, attained its maximum of $2,756,431,571.43 in August, 1865, and hasßince been reduced to $1,890,025,740.89, the princi pal of the debt; $108,755,100 has been paid sinco March Ist, 1877, effecting an annual sav ing of six to seven millions. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest, and tbe application of the proceeds in redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual saving thus se cured since March Ist, 1877, is $14,290,45:3.50. Within a short period over six hundred mil lions of five and six per cent, bands will be come redeemable. This presents a very favor able opportunity not only to reduce the prin cipal of tbe debt, but alse to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention of Congress to the views exoreesed on this subject by the secretary of the treasury in his annual report; and recom mend prompt legislation to enable the treasury department to complete the refunding of the debt which is abont to mature. The continuance of specie payment has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity, The fears that precededed and ac companied resumption have proved ground less. No considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January Ist, 1879, is estimated at $227,399,428. There are still in existence, unconceled, $346,281,016 of the United States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure made necessary by the ex igencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's existence required, in the judg ment of Congress, an issue of legal tender paper money. That it Berved woll the purpose for which it was is not questioned, but the employment'of the notes as paper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the obiect for which they were provided, was not contemplated fey the framers of the law under which they were issued. These notes long since became like any other pecuniary obliga tion of the government, a debt to be paid, and wh^n paid to be canceled as mere evidence of an indebtedness no longer existing. I there fore repeat what was said in the annual mes sage of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress towards a safe and stable currency, which should be ac cepted as tbe policy and duty of tbe govern ment and the interest and security of the people. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value and giving them a legal ten der character, it was believed by many sup porters of the measure that the silver dollar which it authorized would speedily become, under the operations of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill who, while they doubted as to the probability of this result, nevertheless were willing to give the proposed experiment a fair trial with a view to stop the coinage if experience should prove the silver dol lar authorized by the bill continued to be of leas commercial value than the stan dard gold dollar. The coinage of silver dollars under the act referred to began in March, 1878, and has been continued as requir ed by the act. The average rate per month to the present time has been $2,276,492. The total amount coined Drior to tbe Ist of Novem ber last was $72,847,750. Of this amount $47, --081,450 remains in the treasury and only $25, --763,291 are in the hands of the people. A con stant effort has been made to keep th:« curren cy in circulation and considerable expense has been necessarily incurred for this purpose': but its return to the treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the connden* anticipation of the friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dollar containing 4123^ grains of silver has not increased. During tbe year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its coinage tbe market value of the silver which it contained was f nftn ninety to ninety-two cents, as compared with the stand ard gold dollar. During the last year the aver age market value of the silver dollar has been eighty-eight and one-half cents. It is obvi ous that the legislation of the last Congress in regard to silver so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a result of that legislation,has failed to produce tbe effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force requiring as it does the coinage of a nom inal dollar, which in reality is not a dollai, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be first to accept a single metal as the real legal standard of value in circulation, and this a standard of less value than it purports to b« worth in the recognized money of the world. The constitution of the United States, sound financial principles, and our best interests ail require that the oountry should have as its legal tender money both gold and silver coin of an intrinsic value as bullion, equivalent to that which upon its face it purports to possess. The constitution in express terms recognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money, To banish either of these metals from our curren cy is to narrow or limit the circulating medi um of exchange to the disparagement of im portant interests. The United States produces more silver then any other country and is di rectly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world. It will in my judgment contribute to this result if Congress will re peal so much of the existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412.J-O grains of silver, and in its stead will authorize the secretary of the treasury to coin silver dollars of equiva lent value as bullion with gold dollars. This will defraud no man and will be in accordance with familiar precedents. Congress, on sev eral occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to es tablish it more nearly in accordance with the actual rate of value between the two metals. In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found by ex perience to determine the rate of interest debt ors have to pay and to increase the facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidence in the exact performance of moneyed obligations is estab lished. THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The secretary of war reports that the expen ditures of the war department for the fiscal year ended June 30,1880, were $39,924,773.03. The appropriations for this department for the ervice year amount to $41,993,630.40. With espect to the army the secretary invites atten tion to the fact that its strength is limited 4>y section 116, revised <?tatntc 19, to not inor* than 30,000 enlisted men, but that a proviso con tained in the appropriation bills have limited the expenditures to the enlistment of but 25, --000. It is believed the full legal strength is the least possible force at which the present organization can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and economy. While the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation for pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be greatly increased. The rapid extension of the railroad sytem of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and the great tide of emigration which has flowed in on new territory has imposed on the military an entirely new change of policy. The estab lishment of posta along wagon roads and roads frequently traveled is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected of a more substantial character than those hereto fore constructed will bo required. Under ex isting laws permanent buildings cannon be erected without the sanction of Congress, and when sales of military sitea and buildings have been authorized the moneys received have reverted to the treasury and could only become available through a new appropriation. It is recommended that provisions be made by a general statute for tbe sale of such aban doned military posts and buildings as are found to be unnecessary, and for the applica tion of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed conditions of the coun try, their occupation is continued at great ex pense and inconvenience because they affoi d the only available shelter for the troops. ABSENT OFFICEBS. The absence of a large number of officers of the line in active duty from their regiments is a serious detriment to the maintenance of the service. The constant demand for small detachments, each of which should be com manded by a commissioned officer, and the various details of Officers for necessary service away from their commands, occasions a scarc ity in the number required for company duty. With a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law author izing the detail of officers from the active list as professors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities, be so amend ed as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list of the army. the militia. Attontion is asked to the necessity of pro viding by legislation for organizing, arming, and disciplining the active militia of the coun try, and liberal appropriations are recom mended in this behalf. The reports of the ad jutant general of the army and the chief of ordnance touching this subject fully sot forth its importance. AUMY SCHOOLS. The report of the officers in charge of educa tion in the army shows that thereto seventy eight schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The secretary recommends the enlistment of 150 school masters, with the rank and pay ef commissary sergeants. JUDGE ADVOCATES. An appropriation is needed to supply the judge advocate of the army with suitable li braries, and the secretary recommends that the corps of judge advocates be placed upon the same footing as to promotion with the oth er staff corps of the army. Under existing laws tfce bureau of military justice consists of one officer, the judge advocate general Bnd the corps of judge advocates, of eixht officers of equal rank, majors, with a provision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four, when reduced by casualty or- resignation to that number. The consolidation of the bureau of military justice and tbe corps of judge advo cates upon the same basis with the other staff corps of tbe army would remove an un just discrimination against dese.ving officers and subserve the best interests of the service. NATIONAL DEFENSES. Especial attention Is asked to tbe report of the chief of engineers upon the condition of our national defenses. From a personal in spection of many of the fortifioations referred to, the secretary is able to emphasize the rec ommendations made and to state that their in* complete and defenseless condition is discred itable to the country. While other nations have been increasing their means for carrying on offensive warfare and attacking maritime cit ies, we have been dormant in preparing for de fense. Nothing of importance has been done towards strengthening and finishing our casern a ted works since onr late civil war, dur ing which the great guns of modern warfare and heavy armed fortifications came into use among nations, and our earthworks, left by the sodden failure of appropriations, several years since, in all stages of incompletion, are now being rapidly destroyed by the elements. BIVEBS AND HABBOBS. The two great rivers of the North American continent, the Mississippi and Columbia, have their navigable waters wholly within the limits of the United States and are of vast importance to our internal and foreign com merce. The permanancy of the important work at the south pass of the Misssssippi river seems to be assured. There has been no fail ure whatever in the maintenance of the maxi mum channel during the six months ending Aujiu-t 9th, last. The experiment baa opened a broad, deep highway to the ocean and is an improvement upon the permanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among people abroad and at home, and espe cially among the communities of the Mississip pi valley, whose commercial exchanges float in an unobstructed channel safely to and from the sea. A comprehensive improvement of the Mississippi and its tributaries is a matter of transcendent importance. These great water ways comprise a system of inland nsportort&tion, spread like a net work over a 1 argep tra nof the United States and navigable to auextent of many thousand miles. Producers and consumers alike have a common interest; in such uneqall'jd facilities for cheap tiansportation. Geograph ically, commercially and politically they are the strongest tie between the various sections of the country. These channels of communi cation and interchange are the property of the nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters and the plainest principles of public interest require their intelligent and careful supervision with a view to their pro tection, improvement and the enhancement of their usefulness. The channel of the Columbia river for a dis tance of about 100 miles from its mouth is obstructed by a succession of bar*, which occasions serious delays in navigation and heavy expenses for lightage and towage. A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide should be secured and maintained to meet the re quirements of the extensive and growing inland and ocean commerce it subserves. The nrgent need, however, for this gaeat water way is a permanent improvement of the chan nel at the moath of the river. From Columbia river to Ban Francisco, a distance of over 600 miles, there is do harbor on our Pacific coast which can be approached during ntormy weather. An ap propriation of $150,000 was made by the Forty fifth Congress for the commencement of a back water and harbor of refuge, to be located at some point between the straits of Fueca and San Francisco, at which the necessities of com merce, local and general, will be best accom modated. The amount appropriated is thought to be quite inadequate for the purpose intend ed. The cost of the work when finished will be great, owing to the want of natural ad vantages for a site at any point on the coast between the designated limit?, and it has not been tbonsrht to be advisable to undertake the work without a larger appropriation. I com mend the matter to the attention of Congress. The completion of the new building for the war department is urgently needed and the estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended. The collection of books, specimens and rec ords constituting the army medical museum and library are of national im portance. The library now contains about 31,500 volumes and 57,000 pamphlets, relating to medicine, surgery and subjects allied to physics. The contents of the army medical museum consist of 22,000 specimens and are unique in the completeness with whish both military surgery aad the diseases of armies are illustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable los 3, not only to the United States, but to the world. There are filed in the record and pension division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records, to gether with a great quantity of papers embrac ing the original records of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside from their historical value these rccurds are daily searched for evidence needed in the settlement of a large number of pensions and other claims and for the protection of the government against attempted frauds as well as for the benefit of honeet claimants. These valuable contents are now in a building which is peculiarly exposed to the danger of destruc tion by fire. It is therefore earnestly recom mended that an appropriation bs made for a new fire proof building, adequate for the pres ent needs and future expansion of these valu able collections. Such a building fchonld be absolutely fire proof. No expenditure for mere architectural display is required. I", is believed that a suitable structure can be erec ted at a cost cot to exceed $25,000. GEN. GRANT. 1 commend to the attention of Cougresn the great services of the commander-in-chief ot our armies during the war, whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so much to bring that momentous conflict to a close. The legisla tion of the United States contains many pre cedents for the recognition of distinguished military merit, authorizing rank and emolu ments to be conferred for eminent services to the country. An act of Congress authorizing the appointment of a captain general of the army, with suitable provisions relating to com pensation, retirement and other details, would, in my judgment, be altogether fitting and proper, and wonld be warmly approved by the country. THE NAVY. The report of the secretary of the navy ex hibits the satisfactory management of that de partment during the last fiscal year. The total expenditures for the year were $12,916,639.45, leaving nnexpended at tho close of the year $2,141,682.23 of the amount of available ap propriations. The appropriations for the pres ent fiscal year ending June 30, IS3I, are $15, --095,061.45, and the total estimates for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1682, are $15,953, --751.61. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1,1880, to November 1, 1880, is f 5,041, --570.45. The recoramendalion of the secretary of the navy that provision be made for the estab lishment of some form of civil government for the people of Alaska is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property in that territory except such as is afforded by the officers of the United States snip James town. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka be cause of the fear that without tho immediate presence of the national authority there waa impending danger of anarchy. Tbe steps taken to restore order have' been accepted in good faith by both white and Indian inhabitants, and tbe necessity for this method of restraint does not in my opinion now exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving the people as at present without the or dinary judicial and administrative authority of organized local governments, serious conse quences might ensue. The laws provide only for tho collection of revenues, the protection of public property and the transmission of the mails. The problem is to snpply a iocal rule for a population so scattered and so peculiar in its origin and condition. The natives are re ported to be teachable and self-supporting, and if properly instructed, doubtless would be add ed to the national life. I therefore recommend the requisite legislation upon thin subject. The secretary of the navy has taken ftaps towards the establishment of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Pannama to meet the requirements of our commercial relations with Central and South America, which arc rapidly growing in importance. Locations eminently suitable, both as regards our naval purposes and the uses of commerce, have been selected on the cast side of the Isthmus, at Chiriqni Lagoon, in the Carribean Sea, and the other on tbePacifio coast at the Bay of Gal fito. The only safe harbors sufficiently commo dious on the Isthmus arc at these points, and the distance between them is less than 100 miles. The report of tho secretary of the navy con cludes with valuable suggestions with respect to the building up of our present marine ser vice, which deserve the favorable consideration of Congress. TOSTAIi MATTEBS. The report of tho postmaster general ex hibits the continual growth and the high state of efficiency of the postal service. The opera tions of no department of the government, perhaps, represent with greater exactness the increase in the population and business of the country. In 1850 tho postal receipts were $8,518,067.40. In 1880 the receipts wer $33, --315,479.34. All the inhabitants of the coun try arc directly and personally interested in having proper mail facilities and naturally watch tho D.'SD-.fnee very closely. The careful oversight on tho part of the people has proved a constant stimulus to improvement. During the.past year there was an increase of 3,134 postoffices and the mail routes were extended 27,177 mile?, mnking an additional annual transportation of 10,804,191 milcn. The rev enues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated at $39,845,174.10 and the expenditures at $42,475,932, leaving a defi ciency to be appropriated out of the treasury of $3,630,757. JJO. The universal postal union has received the accession of almost all of the countries and colonies of the world maintaining organized postal services, and it is confidently expected that all the other countries and colonies now outside the uuion will soon unite with it, thus increasing the grand idea and aim of the union of forming for the purposes of international mail communication a sinele postal charge and condition of international exchange for all de scriptions of correspondence. To enable tbe United States to do its full share of this great work additional legislation is asked by the NO. 342, postmaster general, to whose • recommendation especial attention in called. The suggestion of the postmaster general that it would be wise to encourage by appro priate legislation the establishment of American lines of steamers, by our own citizens, to carry the mails between oar own ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America and to trans-Pacific countries, is commended to the serious consideration of Congress. The attention of Congress is also invited In the suggestions of the postmaster general in regard to postal savings. THE
