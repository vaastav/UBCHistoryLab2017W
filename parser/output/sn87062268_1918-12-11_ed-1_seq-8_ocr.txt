PALAFOX ST. Constance Talmadge in "A Pair of Sr'k Stockings. If your husband not only objected to your taste in motor cars, insisting on one of his ! own selection, but bought sables for another woman (to make you jealous) as -well, would you immediately lose no time in suing- for a divorce. Come to the Isis Theater today or tomorow and see just how Mollie ThornhiU (Constance Talmadge& solvts the problem of the motor car and the sables. In her latest Select Pictures in which she is presented by Lewis 'J. Selznick. Sam and Mollie ThornhiU, a young English couple, are happy indeed, un til the serious qestion of a motor car arises. Mollie wants this and Sam wants that with the result that Sam in a rage, goes off to make Mollie jealous and attempts this by the sables-for-another method leaving the bill around for her to find. Mollie not only finds the bill, but also the speed iest way ' divorcing Sam and starts off to ir the country in a car of a mi. vhich she is sure Sam dis approved, v d Beauty Appears in Film.: 1 noted Broadway beauty and Foil: j star, Peggy Hopkins, is fea tured in the first Paramount-James Montgomery Flagg two reel comedy, "Hick Manhattan," which shows at the Isis today and tomorrow. , She will be remembered by film fans for her splendid work as the bride in the former Flagg series, "Girls You Know." More recently she has ap peared in "The "Woman and the Law." In "Hick Manhattan" Miss Hopkins plays the barefoot dancer girl, who is down and out "busted" but knows that if she can only hit on a real live idea and get some big publicity that she will be made. Then New York would talk and when New Yorks talks, the press talks, and then something is started!. Boy Howdy! .A clever young publicity man from near Peggy's home town does the rest and both of them make their- for tunes. New York goes wild about her and with reason for anyone as pretty as Flo Donahoe in the story Peggy Hopkins in reality, remember would create excitement in Pompeii! .. The second Flagg comeUy which will follow "Hick Manhattan" after a short interval has already caused much comment in film . circles. An other Peggy is starred, this time Peg gy Adams, a dark haired beauty con trasting perfectly with Miss Hopkns. Miss Adams recently starred In "The Spirit of the Red Cross," the official Red Cross film prepared by Mr. Flagg for the recent Red Cross fund drive. She was chosen because of her beau ty and immense personality as wcv as her appealing charm of manner,- for the Red Cross star, from a large number of actresses who were sug gested. Asked the reason for the choice, Mr. Flagg said, a girl to be attrac tive and "romantic" must have in her eyes a "come-hi ' -r" look and on her lips a "stay there" . smile. It s thought that the two Peggys will at tract all audiences as distinctive types of American Beauties. if 4 1 M, "A PAIR OF StLK STOCKINGS J AT THE ISIS TODAY Sam goes to a country .house and tries to , drown his sorrows in the merry whirl of amateur theatricals.

Original plans were for a road to be five and six inches thick. The change was made' at the recommendation of Lieu tenant Warfield of the Naval Air Sta tion. " , v . Will Get More Money. It is understood that Contractor Gerkins : agreed to make some chan ges in the construction work which would have increased the thickness of the concrete road, without : making additional charge.

The legality of payment from this fund of $50,000 for work on ' the road under changed specifica tions was questioned by Mr Johnson.- The commissioners apparently approved having the road come up to me euginerr s uggestions ana leave one mile unimproved, than to proceed in the original manner. r ';..-?

Two nunarea otner Americans who. have ben scattered in various 'camps in Germany are leaving Germany by way of Holland and Denmark. Hearst Told Editors To Be Anti-Allies (Continued From Page One) Hearst said he believed a vast ma jority of the people in America and Germany opposed the United States entering the war and concluded "we earnestly desire to mploy the In fluence of our country not for the ex tension and protraction of ... the war, but for the promotion of a just and lasting peaec" ' Mysterious Charge Made. A message, dated Marci 2, signed "doctor" and addressed to S. S. Cavarlho, of the New York American, declared that the fa mous Zimmerman note . in which Germany proposed an alliance with Mexico and Japan and which ,. tne Associated Press revealed to . the- wof'd, probably was a fnr. gery ; prepared by the attortser ; general. : , , "The object of the forgery," the message said, "was to frighten, congress into giving the president the powers he demanded and per haps also into passing the espion age bill." Hearst's Message. firmly believe that the vast ma jority of the people of the United States are entirely undesirious of war with Germany. I believe also that the people of Germany are equally undesirous of war - with the United States. Under,. such, circumstances, I cannot see why the century-old friend ship of the United States and Ger many cannot be maintained and per petuated by the high-minded and hu manitarian rulers and political lead ers or our respective countries. "We in America have, just cele brated the anniversary of Washing ton's birthday and this should remind us that the - friendship of Germany and the United States was inaugrated by "Washington- and Frederick the Great, two of the ablest and wisest and most far-seeing statesmen that any nations have possessed in the history of the world- -: "May the statesmen of our respec tive countries today heed the advice and follow the footsteps of these two great leaders of men and builders of nations.. - "The course of my newspapers has been" fair to Germany, not because I am pro-German any more than I am pro-ally. I am merely patriotically interested in the welfare of my own country and altruistically interested in the progress of the world. I am sure that the United States will value in the f utre the consistent friendship - of Germany as -it has valued it in the past and I think that most Americans realize that Germ an v. like France, represents in Europe 3 political, social and economic prog ress similar to our own. "Americans from childhood have been taught to regard both Germany ana France as their proven friends. We thererore deeply deplore the war between these great nations which have contributed so much to the progress and civilization of the world ana we earnestly desire to employ the Influence of our country not for the extension and protraction of the war, but for the promotion of a- just and lasting peace."

Hopes Women Will Adopt This Habit As Well As Men Glass of. hot water each' morn ing helps us look and feel clean, sweet, fresh. Happy, , bright, alert vigorous and vivacious a good clear skin ; a nat ural, rosy complexion and freedom from illness are assured only by clean, healthy, blood. If only every woman and likewise every man could realize the wonders of the morning inside bath, what a gratifying change would take place, - - Instead of the thousands of sickly, anaemic-looking men, - women - and girls with pasty or muddy complex ions; Instead of the multitudes of "nerve wrecks," ; "rundowna,"., "brain fags" and pessimists we should see a virile, optimistic"1 throng 01 rosy cheeked people everywhere. An Inside bath is had by drinking each morning : before breakfast, a glass of real hot water with a tea spoonful of limestone phosphate in it to wash from the stomach, liver, kid neys, and ten yards of bowels the pre vious day's indigestible' waste, sour fermentations and' -poisons, thus cleansing, sweetening and freshening the entire alimentary canal before putting ' more food into " the stomach. Those subject to sick headache, bil iousness, nasty breath, rheumatism, colds; and particularly those who have a palid, sallow complexion and who are constipated very often, are urged to obtain a quarter pound of lime- J swiie puuspxicLke ill me- u s bivmu which will cost but a trifle but is suf ficient to demonstrate the quick and remarkable change in both health and appearance awfeitl&g those who prac tice internal s&nltatlon. We must re member that Inside , cleanliness - is more important than outside, because the skin does not absorb impurities to contaminate the blood, while the pores in ' the thirty feet of bowels do. Adv. ; j PUBLIC BUILDING IN MALLORY COURT IS AGAIN AGITATED Plans for a permanent building to be erected by the city, in Mallory court for the use of bands and pub lic speakers, which were made be fore the war, are being revived. It is probable that a stand to cost about 51500 and 82000 will be erect ed, in the lower , story of which rest rooms for the accommodation of the public will be provided. Mayor Sanders said last night that the plans had been agreed upon by the city commissioners before the war, the cost at that time to total about 51500. Because of increased building costs now it is believed that the build ing will cost more than the original estimate. The need of such a station from which speakers could address public audiences, as in the community sings and war time ,fund campaigns, ' has evidenced itself for some months. The plans as originally drawn call for a red brick structure with a green tile roof to be put up at some point in Mallory court to be determined.
