PRIVATI! FROPERTT ?? BEA IN WAR. The experiences of the last year bring forci? bly home to ns a pense of the burdena and the. waste of war. W? desire, In common with most civilized nations, to reduce t?? the lowest possible point the damage sustained In Um? , f war by peaceful tra le and commerce. It Is true we may suffer In such rnses less than other communities, but nil nations are damaged more or less by the state of iir.c.i?dne?s and apprehen? sion into which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercial world. It should be our object, therefore, to minimize, so far as prac? ticable, this Inevitable lOSS and disturbance. This purpose ran probably bent be accomplish?*! by an International agreement t.? regard all private property at sea a- exempt from capture m- (lesti-..?'.:???! by the forcea of belligerent i? .. ; - t?? United Statee Government haa for many years advocated thla humane and benefi? cent principle, and is now in p. altion t" recom? mend It to other Powers without tbe Imputa? tion of selfish motives I therefore suchest for your consideration that tb??

THE TBLLOW rsvER In my la*>t annual Message I recommended I that Congress authorize the appointment <>f a commission for the purpose Of making sys? tematic investigation? with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow fever. This matter has acquired an increased Importance as a result of the military occupation of the Island of ?'uba, and the commercial Intercourse be? tween this island and the United States which wo have every reason to expect The sanitary prohlcnis connected With our now n-latlons With the Island of Cuba and the acquisition of Porto Rico are no less important than those relating to finance, commerce, and administration? It Is my earnest desire that thes?? problems may be considered by competent exports ami that every thlng may i.e done which the most recent ad van, ?? in sanitary seleni a can offer for the pro ; ? m of the health of our soldiers lu those Islands and of our Citizens who are exposed to the ?lang^rH of Infection from th? Importation of yellow fever. I therefore renew my recom? mendation that th.- authority of Congress may l?? Kiv-n and a suitable appropriation made to pr?vido for a commission of exports to be ap? pointed for tho purpose Indicated, INCESASI 0? Till: REGULAR ARMY. Under the act of Congress approved April 2?5, 1W?8, authorizing the lh-esld. nt in his dis? cretion, "under a declaration of war by Con? gress, or a declaration by Congress that war exists," I directed tho increase of the Regular Army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized In said act There are now In tho Regular Army 57,802 officers and men. In said set it waa provided "that at the end of any war in which the United States may become Involved tho Army ??hall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer in the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorable dlseharge. under such regulations as tho rvcretary of War may estab? lish, of supernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable ilisoiiarKe or truiisi-r of su pernumerary enlisted men; and nothing con? tained In this act shall be construed SS authoriz? ing the pennati? nt Increase of tho commis? sinned or enlisted forco of the Regular Army beyond that now provided by the law in fona prior to the r SSI age of this act, except as to tho increase of twenty-five majors provided for in Section 1 hereof." The Importance of legislation for tho perma? nent Increase ol the Army is therefore manifest, and tho recommendation of the Secretary of War for that purpose has my unqualified ap? proval. There can be n?> question that at thla lime, and probably for some time In the future, one hundred thousand men will bo none too many to meet the necessities of th? situation. At all sventa, whether that number shall be required pei r or not, the power aho il I be given to the President to enlist that force if in his discretion ?t should be necessary; and tho further discretion should be given him to re? cruit for the Army w thin the above limit from the Inhabitants of the Islanda with the govern? ment of which we are charged. [t Is my purpose to mister out tho entire vol? unteer army as soon as the Congress anali pro? vi.le for the Increase ? t the regular establish? ment This will be only an act of Justice, and Will be much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes and employments to help the country in Its emergency.

GROWTH OF THB POSTAL SERVICE. The postal service of the country advances with extraordinary growth. Within twenty years both the revenues and the expenditures of the Postoftlce Department have multiplied threefold. In the last ten y?-ars they have near? ly doubled, ??ur postal business grows much more rapidly than our population. It now ln volvea aj? expenditure of $100;000,000 a year, numbers 73,000 postOfflC?M and enrolls 200,000 employ??. This remarkable extension <>f a ser? vice which UI an accurate Index of the public conditions presents gratifying evidences of the advancement of education, of the increase of communication and business activity, and of the Improvement of mail facilities, leading to their constantly augm?nting use. The war With Bpaln laid new and exceptional ; labors on the Postone?

The communication between home and ? camp was naturally eager and expectant. In some of the larg.-r places of rendezvous BJ mat,,? as fifty thousand letters a day required handling. Thia necessity waa met by the prompt d I ami dispatch of experienced men from the es? tablished forces by directing all the Instru mentalities of the railway-mall and postofflee service so far as necessary to this ???.? need. Congress passed an act empowering the Post? master-Genera] to establish offices or branch?e at every military camp or station, and under this authority the postal machinery' was speed? ily rut Into effective operation Under the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip? pines, they were attended and followed by the postal service. Though the act of Congress au? thorized the appointment of postmasters where necessary, it was furly determined that the public Interests would besi be eubserved, not | by new designations, but hv the detail of ex? perienced nun, familiar with every branch of the service, and this policy vas steadily fol? lowed. When the terrlt?iry which VU the theatre of conflict came Into our possession. It I????-eme necessary to reestablish mall facilities i for the resident population, as well as to pro? vide them for our forces of occupation, and th? former requirement was met through the ?,x ; tension and application of th? latter obligation. ? ? gave the requisita authority, ami th* aame general principle ?'as applied to this aa to brat he? of civil administration under military ' occupation. Tb?* details are more particularly Riven tn the report of the Postmaster-1;? ? and, while th?? work Is only Just begun, it is 1 pleasing to be able to say that th? service which has come under our control Is already materially improved.

DEPARTMENT OF ACJKK tltttRK. The Department of Agriculture has been ac? tive In the last year. Kxplorers have been sent to many of the countries of the Kastern and Western hemispheres for s?*eds and plants that may be useful to the United Btatea, and with th.? further view of opening up markets for our surplus products The Forestry Division of the Department Is giving special attention to tho tr. ?

The Department ?* Inquiring Into the tiso and abuse of water in many Htates of the West, and collecting Information regard ? ing the laws of the States, the decisioni of the ! courts and the customs of the people In this , regard, so that uniformity may be secured. Ex? periment stations are hecomlng more effective every year. The annual appropriation of .<7'J0, (**) by Congress Is supplemented by 5?}??).(??) from the states. Nation-wide esperimenti have been conducted to ascertain the suitableness as ! to soil nnd climate and States for growing sugar beets Th'> number of sturar factories has been , doubled in the last two years, and the ability of tho Fnlted Htates to produce its own surcar from ! this sonne has been clearly demonstrated.

Till" ANNIVERSARY OF THE CAPITAI* In the year lls'O will occur the centennial an? niversary of the founding of the city of Wash? ington f<>r the permanent capital of the Gov? ernment of the United States by authority of an act of Congress approved July 1?, 1790. In May, 1800, tl,? archlv?ea and general offices of the Federal Government were removed to this place. On the 17th of November, 1800k the National Congress met here for the first time, and as ' siimeil exclusive control of thu Federal district hi. 1 city. This Interesting event assumes all ? the more significance when we recall the cir? cumstances attending the choosing of the alte. the naming of the capital In honor of the Father of ills Country, and the interest taken by him In the adoption of plans for its future de veiopment on a magnificent scale. These original plans have ?.?.?? wrought out with a constant progress and a siznal success even beyond anything their frsmers could have foreseen. The people of the country are justly I roud of the distinctive beauty and government of th?.? capitai, and of the rare instrument of eel? nee and education which here found their natural home. A movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversary cele ? ? 1 with fitting ceremonies, including, psr haps, the establishment of a handsome perma? nent memorial to mark so historical an occasion, n;d to give it more than local recognition, has met with general favor on the part of th?? public I recommend to the Congress the granting of an appropriation for this purpose, and the ap? pointment of a committee from 1rs respective It might also be advisable to authorize the President to appoint a committee from the country ar lartre, which, noting with the fon u?', and District of Columbia committees, ? m con | ete the plans for an appropriate Na? tional celebration.

Executive Mansion. Dee, B. IMS. COMMENTS OP LONDON PRESS. ????? PRAISE AND CRITICISM FOR THE MESSAGE OF THE PRESTDFNT. London, Pec. C Much having been expected, there is a certain tone of disappointment In the morning paper editorials on President McKin ley's Message. Its non-committal character Is attributed to the fact that the negotiations of the Peace Commissions at Paris have not yet finished. Considerable satisfaction Is expressed at ??? references to Anglo-American relations and at the coldness displayed toward Russia. "The Dally News" complains of the "am bigulty of the Messane on commercial and cur? rency mutters" and "the conspicuous absence of anv allusion to free trade." "Th? Timos" says: If Is creditable to both th? dignity and good aei ? of the American people th.it a messar.? ann? unclng the victorious ending of ? great war, the acqti ? of territory and the Initiation of an Im] 'u -?'?er intoneandmoderate In recom? tlons The war h is tinaiiy healed the ha If-closed wounds left after the titanic con? tile ts of the Becesslon, and we hops it has exer? els? 1 ? hi Si ng Influence to be f, || even more widely and deeply In another direction.

Discussing the Message approvingly in detail and r?'fe,rrlng to Hrltlsh rlurhfs in Nicaragua ? under the Clayton Bulwer treaty. "The Times" I ? if the freedom of the waterway Is secured to ships of all nations, as In the Sue*. Canal, we shall riot need to stand strictly upon claims Which originated when the circumstances were altogether different. "The ? >aiiy Chronicle?? also pays a tribute to the ober, sound common-sense and straight? forward language" of the Message, pointing out ib.it Presidi m McKlnley's reference to the mili? tary occupation of Cuba virtually outlines a pol? icy "precisely the same a? that of ?r; rea I Britain I Iti | . :\ pt, and bk ly to have the same effect." Commenting upon "the President'.?- surprising language concerning th.? Nicaragua ?'anal. which utterly ignores Hrinsh treaty rights." "The Dally Chronicle" says that "this matter will ails.? ere long In a more acute form." The > lltorial highly approves Mr. McKinley's refer v ? ? s to China and < ?reat l?ritain. 'he Riandai d" says: Few rould have for, told that the war would ? so rapid and drastic a change. Mow ?bso- ? lut.? ?le? m tamorphosls Is may best he gathered j from a comparison with previous Mesaagea It is not rash to predict that the United States will j advance in the path upon which their feet are no? lirmly set. "The Standard" construes Mr. McKinley's ref? erences to China as "a declaration that had the 'open do.r' been closed or obstructed, America Would have Interfered actively." It adds upon this point: For all purposes of Rrltlsh policy no intima? tion could le mor?? welcome than that the I'nited Stat.s will ap? nut a committee to study the conditions In China. "Th?? Dally Telegraph," which repards the an ' "? nl tin (I,.? ITnlted Statue will support tb??
