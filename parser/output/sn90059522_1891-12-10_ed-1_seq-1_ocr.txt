The St. Paul Convention Dele gation Put in More Good Licks. \ General Feeling: That St. Paul Will Secure the Con tion. Convention Boomers and Min nesota's Congressional Del egation Bine. Witty Speeches Made by Va rious Members of tht Jolly Gathering:. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec i). The members of the St. Paul Democratic convention delegation continued their "good work today. Many of the members of the na tional executive committee remained in Washington on public or private busi ness, and many of the members of the general committee are members of congress in the senate and the house. The delegation having the ben efit of several days' experience, know just where to put in their time to advantage and did so. Most of them were present at the capitol to hear the president's message read, and received cordial greetings from members of each house when they put in an appearance. They feel not only sanguine of success, but know that they have earned it. If St. Paul will put half the strength into the light, now that tne preliminary skirmish is over, victory is certain. '• The Banquet 'I ill* Evening. At 7 o'clock this evening the parlors at Chamberlin's held a distinguished company. The members of the delega tion present were Mayors Smith and Winston. Judge Flandrau, Lewis Baker, Mai. McGinness, of Duluth; J. Royall McMurran and his uncle, William L. Royall, from Richmond, Va., gen eral counsel for many years of the English bondholders in their suits against the state; George Bacon and Edward G. Rogers, formerly of St. Paul, now of Chicago; Senator C. K. Davis, Congressmen Castle, Lind and Harries, .John F. Baker and George W. Hayes. The ball opened with Judge Flandrau crossing the room to meet Maj. McGinniss. saying, "Is this McGinniss or McGinty?" "The major reflected the color of his red necktie, and acknowl edged that be was the former at the house of representatives today. He started to walk in, but the doorkeeper stopped him. "McGinnis, Montana, twelve years," said he. "Walk in." The major laughed, but did not walk in, not wishing to sail In on his brother's record. Senator W. D. Washburn re gretted his inability to be present be cause of A Previous Knga^enieiit. to dine out with his wife. He conveyed hls compliments to the delegation and their guests, and wished them the best of luck in getting the convention. Con gressman Halvorsen, though expected, did not put In an appearance. Toast master Flandrau started the good things of the evening by poising his glass of old sherry and proposing the toast: "The Health -*f Senator Davis and Our Minnesota Representa tives." The arrangement of the seats at the table in John Chamberlin's famous dining hall was as follows: Sen ator Davis at the head. Judge Flandrau at the foot, Lewis Baker on the senator's right hand, Mayor Winston on his left, Mayor Smith at Judge Flandrau's left, Mr. Royall, Maj. McGinnis, Royal Mc- Murran and George W. Haves. Next Maj. Winston on the left were Mr. Har ries, Mr. Lind, E. (i. Rogers, Mr. Castle, John Baker and George V. Bacon. Universal regret was expressed at Con gressman Hall's absence, he being ill at his hotel. The Second Toast, by Royall Mc Murran— was "The Next President or the United States.may he be nominated in St. Paul, or thereabouts." Mayor Winston moved that the last work be struck out. The amendment was allowed amidst a roar of laughter, and the tost was enjoyed by all. Mr. Lind feared to tackle a deviled soft shell crab. Senator Davis coaxed him to try it, and he pronounced it excellent. The good cheer and fun thai, really com menced when the entrees and cham pagne were served were a fitting close to the labors of the past three days. The third toast to "Phil" (Mayor Wins ton), followed by the fourth to "Bob" (Mayor Smith), is indicative of the way ceremony was dispensed with. "Mr. Baker," spoke up Mr. Lind, to Lewis Baker, "Somebody asked me the dimensions of the new convention hall. 1 couldn't think of the figures you gave me, so I said *A Mile Square.' "How was that?" What's the matter with Congressman Lind as a conven tion boomer. He's all right, you bet. Senator Davis' health was proposed^ "May be lons and well fill the position lie now occupies." Amended by Royal McMurran with "Forever I'm a" Demo crat. We're Liberal." This was encored heartily and drunk with zest. With terrapin came the toast. "Maryland. My Maryland." emphasized by Judge Flan drau singing the first bar of the old song. Then came "Judge Flanurau's Health. One of the Youngest Men in Appearance in Minnesota of His Age." "Well," said the judge, "1 first ar rived here sixty-three years ago." "Born here?" inquired a voice. "No, 1 emigrated Herefrom New York city, aged three months." "St. Paul and the Democratic Conven tion," proposed by Mayor Winston, of Minneapolis, caused the glasses to be emptied by the. entire gathering. Mr. Lind's toast. "Here's to the Twin Cities Without Discrimination," and subse quent remarks, very feelingly deliv ered, were most happy. Progress Is Reported. Then said Lewis Baker: "One of the objects of coming together this evening was to report progress and to leave our cause in the hands of our Minnesota members of congress, to apprise the gentlemen that we would always be with them and that we were going to leave this proposition in their hands as to entertaining the two conventions. We can do it most handsomely." The next speaker arose amid great ap plause, lt was Senator Davis, who spoke as follows: "My Friends and Neighbors: 1 have said it before, 1 now say it again, 1 am giad to meet with you tonight as a citizen of St. Paul. 1 have lived in Minnesota a great many years. "We are gathered here as rational Chris tian men, hoping to achieve our aim and be honored by having this second convention located in our midst. 1 hoped to be present tonight without making a speech. 1 went to St. Paul in 18G4 unknown, poor, with friends to make. My reward has been what you know. In state affairs all controversies -■.-.; . . • .^ ■'. - , ■ - - - hi iVli^ and matters of party have been sub ordinated to good breeding and the best interests of all. Nothing but po litical principles have divided us. On all public occasions, when one party has been pitted against the other, our personal differences have been present ed with The Utmost Kindness. "Now in regard to the immediate reason for gathering here. Speaking for myself and my colleague, Senator Washburn, who Is unavoidably kept away to-night, no effort or inducement ou our part will tie withheld to locate at the head center of national Democ racy in Minnesota that convention." Judge Flandrau agreed with Senator Davis in all that he said in a most happy speech. "In little issues we disagree, in I rge matters we pull together." "I call upon Mayor Winston/' said Mr. Rogers. , Congressman Castle, Har ries and the member who hailed from New rim, "The greatest little town in Minnesota," as Judge Flandrau termed it, followed, making short addresses. •John F. Baker responded to the toast, "The Managing Editor." Then Mr. Eoyall, of Virginia, was called upon in behalf of "The Mother of Presidents, the Great Commonwealth of Virginia." Following him Royal McMurran made one of his characteristic, bright, clever speeches, responding to the toast, "Woman." The Toast "St. Paul." Senator Davis arose and made an elo quent introduction, calling upon Robert A. Smith to speak upon the subject of "St. Paul." Major; McGinnis (not McGinty) spoke in behalf of Duluth in a witty epigramat lcal speech, incidentally saying "Min neapolis has the Republican conven tion, surely St. Paul will have the Demo cratic; and the Zenith City, well, we ex pect to ask for the Prohibition or Farm ers' Alliance party." (Great applause.] George V. Bacon, when called upon, was most happy in liis remarks. "Upon arriving in Washington, and at John Chamberlin's, our party decided upon four committors, and elected a chair man for each, as follows: Royall Mc- Murran on di inks. Judge Flandrau and lion. E. G. Rogers, the ladies; and my self, well, they elected me chairman of the committee on sleep." By far the best speech of the evening was made by Hon. Edward G. Rogers. His golden ratiocinations brought down the house, and upon motion he was unanimously elected one of the speak ers to present the claims of St. Paul to the general convention Jan. 21, 1892. The banquet adjourned at midnight. 

CHILI/* FOX THE WEST. It Gets Nothing Out of the House Offices. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 9.— A very curi ous fact is that the elective offices of the house have all gone East and North east, the Southeast gets the speakership, but the Southwest, Northwest and the West get nothing. Under the Repub licans the West was recognized by giv ing the postmastership to Montana and the sergeant-at arms to lowa. Consid ering the strength of the Northwestern Democratic delegations this result is rather surprising. Not a state west of the Illinois river gets a representative in the house, made largely Democratic by them. The offices were filled as fol lows: Georgia, the speakership; Penn sylvania, the clerkship; Ohio, sergeant at-arms: Indiana, the postmaster; New- York, the doorkeeper. The speakership is worth 110,000 a year, clerkship $5,000, sergeant-at-arms $4,500, doorkeeper £3,500, postmaster (2,500. • These officers have the power of appointment of 150 minor places, varying in salary from $3,000, paid the chief clerk, Journal and reading clerks, to $3,000, 2,500, S2,oi>o, $1,600, $1,500. 81.400, $1,200 and $1,000. Congressmen only request, but do not control these minor offices, and the chances of appointees from the West are slim because they have no special means of reaching these offices through one or more of themselves. Just what excuse the Western Democratic members will give for allowing a little group of stales to monopolize all these great ollices is hard to guess. NOT OFFICES ENOUGH. Democratic Members ofthe House Must Reduce Demands. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 9.— The rumor is that in consequence of the large number of Democratic members of the house, and the impossibility of supplying each one with an appointee, there must be a reduction of demand for places at least to the extent of one-third. Two hun dred and thirty-five Democratic mem bers and about ' 160 places, large and small, to fill, makes it probable that the new appointments will be made slowly. With regard to the applicants for read ing clerks, it is understood that the new clerk for the house will follow the prec edent established by the late clerk, and will require two tests, one private test in the hall of the house during an even ing, the hall being vacant; the other a public test during a session. Charles K. McKennly.of North St. Paul, at present chief enrolling clerk, will probably be decapitated this week. He has cleaned out his desk for his successor, and states that he will return to Minnesota. Will Remain on the Ground. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec." 9.— Mr. Castle, in conversation today, said that he should not leave the capitol during the.present recess, but remain and familiarize him self with the new responsibilities. He hopes during the interim to pick up some votes for St. Paul as the conven tion city, and from conversation with members of the house from a large ma jority of the states, he has very little doubt of St. Paul's success. . lie says that Congressman Bryan, from Omaha, states that his city will make no fight for the convention. Northwesterner May Get It. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 9.— There is con siderable speculation as to the new Re publican member of the interior state commerce commission. Col. Hepburn, who is now solicitor general or the treasury, is mentioned, and also ex- United States Senator McDill. who was for some years a member of the state railroad commission, both of lowa, and Congressman John Lind, of Minnesota, is also mentioned. The salary ot the position to be filed is $7,200 per annum.and the term of office five or six years. The Minnesota Monument. Special to the Globe. Washington. Dec. 9.— Hon. Edward McPherson, ex-clerk of the house, one of the directors of the Gettysburg Bat tlefield association, says that ground has not yet been broken for the Minne sota monument on that field. He con siders the amount, $20,000, very hand some and liberal. Meredith Succeeds Lee. Alexandria, Ya., Dec. 9. — The special election held today in the Eighth congressional district of this state, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Ben. W. 11. F. Lee, resulted In a victory for the Democratic candidate, E. E. Mere dith. 

SAINT PAUL MINN., THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1891. PLACING THE PLUMS. Probable Distribution of the Desirable Chairmanships in the House. Speaker Crisp Unpledged as to Any Assignment With in His Gift. Mp. Mills, It Is Said, May De cline the Ways and Means if It Is Offered. Senate Berths — Mes sage Read-~Officeseekers Are Numerous. Washington, Dec. 9.—Notwithstand ing the fact that the organization of both branches of congress has been per fected in its main details and the presi dent has been informed that they we're ready to receive his communications, it still remains for the managers at each end of the capitol to supply an all-im portant part of the legislative machine —the committees -before the wheels can begin to revolve and the Fifty-sec ond congress can begin to discharge its proper functions. Already the man agers in both branches of congress are struggling with the problen of how to accommodate each aspirant lor a committee assignment with his personal preference without causing discontent, and with due regard to pub blic policy. It is said upon good author ity that Speaker Crisp had not up to this morning offered a single committee chairmanship to auy member of the house, and for that reason reports as to his intentions are purely speculative and conjectural, based on consideration of geographical location, experience in special lines of legislation and adher ence or non-adherence to the late can vass of the new sneaker. Though Mr. Crip has said he will not punish his op ponents, his friends naturally will not be overlooked where meritorious. Crisp's Policy. The speaker has, to a few friends.out lined the policy which will govern him. so far as individual characteristics of members will permit, in the make-up of the committee, He will, it is learned, endeavored to give the West and North prominence in the membership of the leading committee, and avoid as far as possible charges of sectionalism. The few experienced Democrats from north of Mason and Dixon's line will, therefore, fare weli at the hands of the speaker, and Mr. Crisp will advance to important committee places a number of the newer men whose abilities, it is believed, will qualify them for the as sumption of important trusts, even though their experience has not been so great as is usually necessary to secure much coveted committee honors. The practical adjournment of the house for a week will give the speaker an opportunity to do a great deal of work toward fixing the committees be fore the Christmas holidays. The com mittees on rules, enrolled bills, accounts and mileage will be appointed as soon as possible. The custom of recent years has made thy chairmen of tiie two most important committees, those on ways and means and appropriations, the party associates of the speaker on the rules committee. ills May Decline. Mills is expected to be tendered the chairmanship of the ways and means committee account of his identifica tion with the tariff reform movement, but personal considerations may induce him to decline this honor, and to prefer a place as slmplv a member of the com mittee. Ex-Speaker Reed and Mr. Bur rows, of Michigan, are named as the Republican members of the rules com mittee. In advance of a tender of the place, definite information as to whether or not Mr. Mills would accept the ways and means chairmanship cannot be hail; but Mr. Mills, it ls known, would prefer not to be on the rules committee, and, should the custom of coupling the two places be followed, this would increase the probabilities of a declination of both. As Mr. Spnnger is a Northern man. there is reason to believe he is not unlikely to be Mr. Mills' Democratic successor, and he is almost certain of being a member of the ways and means committee, if not the chairman. Mr. Holman. of Indiana, is the most prominently mentioned representative for the chairmanship of appropriations, but the name of Mr. McMillin, of -Ten nessee, was today suggested for the honor; and. aside from experience, abil ity and the knack of feeling the temper of the house, he has in his favor the fact that two adjoining states seldom get the two most important chairman ships, and that it would be A Graceful Thins for the speaker to appoint one of his principal opponents. Mr. McMillin can, of course, stay on the ways and means committee if he prefers. But Northern men will dominate these two principal committees. Messrs. Hatch and Bland, of Missouri, are slated for the chairmanship of the agricultural and coinage, weights and measures committees. Amos Cummings, of New York, is the probable chief of the committee on mer chant marine and fisheries, and post offices will go to Blount, of Georgia, its chairman In the Fiftienth congress. Herbert, of Alabama, has a sort of pre scriptive right to the naval affairs com mittee through being its former chair man, in which position he had an Influ ential part in the upbuilding of the new navy. The foreign affairs committee will have for two of its members Chip man, of Michigan, and McCreary, of Kentucky, with geographical location in favor of the former as chairman and longer experience on the side of the lat ter. Mr..Fitch, of New York, will, it is believed, secure either a chairmanship or an almost equally eligible committee place, and may be the New York mem ber of the ways and means committee. Mooted Assignments. Vr. Outhwaite, of Ohio, is the proba ble chairman of the Pacific railroad committee unless he should prefer elections. Being a Georgian is the principal point against Mr. Turner, of Georgia, in connection with the chair manship of the committee on commerce, and either he or Isadore Rayuer, of Maryland, will figure in this place, membership on the ways and means committee going to the one losing the chairmanship. Unless Wilson, of West Virginia, goes on the ways and means committee he will - get a chair manship. He has seen service on the manufactures committee, but prob abably prefers some other committtee. The public buildings committee will go to the North very likely, and Fornev, of Alabama, can look after the militia if he wants to while attending also the appropriations. Culberson, of Texas, and Gates, of Alabama, are the best qualified for the head of the judiciary committee. The immigration committee will very likely go to Covert, ot New York. The needs of the District of Columbia will be looked after by Hemphill, of South Carolina. Andrew, of Massachusetts, stands the best chance of leading the civil service reform committee. There : are numerous other committees, but talk as to them has not yet crystallized sufficiently to become more than a glit tering generality. PSENATK PLUMS, An Outline of the Possible Distri bution. Washington, Dec. 9.— ln the senate the only contest likely to be expected is one relating to a committee of minor importance— that of the library, where at least three senators, Stockbridge of Michigan, Dixon of Rhode Island, and Wolcott of Colorado, are anxious to suc ceed the late chairman, Senator Evarts. A struggle is possible, however, over the vacancy on the appropriations com mute caused by Senator Farwcll's re - tirement, inasmuch as a place on this committee is of much more im portance locally than on other com mittees, as it is supreme in the matter of expenditure of the public moneys, but beyond the fact that the place will probably go to one of the new far Western senators, there is no visible determination. Senator Mitchell, who has been chairman of the railroad committee for two terms, expects to fill Senator Spooner's place as chairman of the committee on claims, and he is likely to get it without much opposi tion. Senator McMillin, of Michigan, will probably assume the chairmanship of the committee on the District of Columbia vacated by Senator lugalls, but, this may require him to relinquish his present chairmanship on the manu factures committee.which will naturally pass to Senator Quay. Senator Casey, of North Dakota, is as good as booked for Senator Mitchell's present position of chairman of the com mittee on railroads, as he has had no chairmanship since he entered the sen ate. Possibly Senator Wilson, of lowa, though a member of several hard worked committees, may be induced to accept the chairmanship of the commit tee on education vacated by Senator Blair, as lie stands next in order of pro motion, but this would result in holding two chairmanships, and it may reason ably be expected that this rather unde sirable place will be haeded over to a new senator. Senator Hoar goes by order and by preference to the head of the judiciary committee, vice Edmunds, resigned. Senator Teller takes his place as chair man of the committee on privileges and elections, and places Senator Piatt in position lo lake" the lead in the patents committee. There is some talk of giv ing Senator Peffer a place on the agri cultural committee. Some politics are involved in this, and it may be that the Alliance senator may secure a more de sirable place as a result of the efforts of the Republican and the Democratic managers to keep him on their respect ive sides. Nobody has undertaken as yet to as si.'ii Senator Kyle, the South Dakota Alliance senctor, but the expressed v.'ewsof Mr. lrby, the South Carolina Alliance senator,, have caused him to be assigned to the minority representation. 

HOUSE AND SENATE. Reading of the Message the Only Washington, Dec. 9.— After the ap proval of the journal of yesterday's proceedings in the house the committee appointed to wait upon the president, through its chairman, Mr. Blount, of Georgia, informed the speaker that it had performed the duty imposed upon it. and that the president would send a communication in writing. A recess, was taken for fifteen minutes. After the recess, Doorkeeper Turner per formed his first public duty in his now field of labor by announcing the pres ence of Mr. Prnden, one of the presi dent's secretaries. Mr. Pruden deliv ered the annual message of the president, which was immediately read by the clerk. During the reading many of the members lefl the hall and those who remained at tended to their correspondence or en gaged in merry, and, at times, hilarious conversation. The ouly men who showed any interest were Messrs. Her bert (Ala.), Miller (Wis.), and Otis and Simpson, of Kansas. On the comple tion of the reading, the message! was, on motion of Mr. Out waite, of Ohio, referred to the committee of the whole and ordered printed. Mr. Miller, of Wisconsin, offered a resolution requesting the speaker, in appointing the committees, to appor tion the same among the several states and territories, according to population, and to appoint at least a chairman from each slate and territory. Mr. Milliken, of Maine, sarcastically expressed the hope that the speaker would not be em barrassed by any new rules. On mo tion the resolution was referred to the committee on rules, when appointed. On motion of Mr. Holman, the house then adjourned until Saturday, with the understanding that a further ad journment should be then taken until Wednesday. Immediately after the reading of the journal in the senate Mr. Sherman, from the joint committee to wait on the president of the United States and in form him that congress was ready to re ceive any communication he might choose to make, reported that the com mittee had performed that duty and had been informed that the president would send a communication in writing. Ten minutes afterwards the annual message of the president was presented by Sec retary Pruden, was laid before the sen ate and was read by its secretary. The reading of trie message closed at 1 o'clock, having consumed exactly an hour and a half, It was listened to throughout with close interest by the senators and small audience. The mes sage was ordered to belaid on the table, and then the senate adjourned till to morrow. 

HOUSE EMPLOYES. Many Experienced Clerks Will Be Retained. Washington, Dec. 9.— The struggle for minor offices and places about the house continues. Fully two-thirds of the employes of the house in the Fiftieth congress are here expecting to be rein stated to their former positions. The house during the last few years has re turned to its early practice of retaining skilled and experienced employes in ■ important positions, which has been the almost uniform rule of the senate, and it now has on its pay roll employes who can point to over a quarter of a century's service. yttS The colored librarian. William Smith, has been connected with the house nearly thirty years, as has also John' Cauncey, who has been raising and low ering the flag over the house ever since its occupancy In 1800. Dr. Finch.- file clerk, has a. record of twenty-seven years' service, while Harry Smith, jour nal clerk, has been connected with tbe house committee, as bill aud printing clerk, tally clem and journal clerk for more than twenty years. An effort to retain these gentlemeu hag been made. Ike Hill, of Ohio, will, it Is said, be ap pointed deputy sergeant-at-arms of the house by Mr. Voder.- V, -- m-j -t-t. -.V-\et. CRUSHED AND BURNED Nearly a Score of People Lose Their Lives in Fires at Louisville. Firemen Buried Under Fall ing Walls and Workers Lost in Flames. The Death List Likely to Be Swelled by Many Who Ape Badly Hurt. A Day of Dire Confusion and Hoppop in the Beautiful "" Falls City. -. Locisville, Ky., Dec. 9. —A disas trous fire visited this city last night, destroying the block of buildings on the north side of Main street, between Sixth and Seventh. In the early evening the store and stock -of , the Boone Paper company were . destroyed, entailing a loss of $05,000. While the firemen were working in the ruins ofthe Boone Paper company, at 4:30 this morning, there camo the sound of a terrific explosion in the Bam berger, .Strong & Co. building, four stories high, on the east. In an instant flames broke from every floor and shot out through the roof. Fire must have been smouldering for several hours in the cellar, and when each of the four stories had become filled with heated air and smoke an explosion 'followed, and the building was one mass of flames. A number of firemen, all hook and ladder men, were caught under a fall ing wall of Bamberger, Strong & Co.'s building. The deadfliremen are Will iam Moore, William Davis, Sam Baker and Tony Schlicht. At 8 o'clock another fatal fire was raging in F. A. Menne & Co.'s whole sale candy and fancy grocery house, a square above the Boone Paper com pony's building. Forty girls were at work wrapping candy on the fourth floor and all Were Not A bio to Escape. To add to the casualties and the con fusion, Maj. Hughes, chief of the fire department, was badly hurt in an acci dent. He and Henry 'Weatherford, the chief's assistant, started to what seemed a big lire, but they happened to get on the wrong side of the street, as Maj. Hughes himself states. The salvage corps wagon ran into their buggy as they were rapidly driving up the street, and almost literally ran over them. The buggy was smashed, ■ and the horses tramned on both 'Chief Hughes and Weatherford. The hitter's wrist was badly hurt, and when Che chief called out for help Weather ford was . unable to go to his assistance. No. 13 engine ran into the Davement at Twelfth and Broadway, throwing off Engineer Jim Nutteile, hurting his back, and probably crippling him for life. A member of a hook and ladder company was at work at Menu & Co.'s, and started to fall, but grabbed at .the broken sky light. He saved himself from probably a fatal plunge, but nearly severed his hand from his arm at the wrist. In the face of these Disasters and Terrors the firemen stood bravely to their work, and new leaders took the places of those removed. The water tower was manned and a dozen streams brought to bear on. the place. Within half an hour the flames were under control, but within this time half a score of lives were sacrificed. Of the fo r ty girls, two escaped at the cost of grievous wounds. They were Theresa lloltbouse and Liz zie McUarvey. the latter with a broken leg. The flames communicated .with the big stock of Christ mas fireworks. The tirst explosion among the fireworks scattered firebrands all over the store. The sky light fell in and the entire stock, much of which was.highly inflammable, was fiercely blazing almost immediately. The sky-rockets, Roman candles and giant firecrackers were so wild in their havoc that they impeded the work of the tire men and made it exceedingly dangerous for them to work uutil the last one had exploded. Searching the Ruins. Gangs of workmen have been busy In the ruins of the fire on Main street all day since the flames were subdued, and are still busily engaged. At Menne's, the candy factory, 517 West avenue, where the ten men were entombed by the walls, there is a pile of wreckage in the street, and broken floors and rafters twenty feet from the front of the building The mass is still smouldering and there is no hope for any to live. It is in the paper company's building, instead of Bamberger, Strong & Co.'s, as first sup posed, tne missing firemen are now be lieved to be. The hose they were work ing stretches out onto the street and serves as a guide to the searchers. They are hurrying out the bundles of black ened paper with some faint hope that one or two of the men may be still alive wedged between the huge piles of paper "that filled the cellar. But the steam and 'Occasional jets of flame breaking out j _ " , " 1J, *'^''»Ule chance. Crowds gatb £ 'uins but are kept movn.Ji . 'ife. They can only ; see the blackeneu'ironts of five of the leading business houses of the city, and iin a dim light at a narrow entrance ; men moving small portions of*-' the smoking mass within. t At 10 o'clock the body of Charles Kim mei was reached at the candy factory, and a little later two bodies, supposed to be those of Clara Rauch and William Hulsemeier. This leaves three more supposed to be in the ruins at this point. The Dead Recovered. Lulu Km, Cardie LSckhardt. Barbara Bell. . Amanita Dickey. v William Hulsemeier. Charles Kimmel. Clara Havch. Those missing and certainly dead at the Boone Paper company are: Tom Moore, _- Sam Baker, Will Davis, Tony Schlick. All of No. 1 Hook and Ladder company. At Menne & Co.'s.: Ida IJeli.e Packer, James Munwkileb. I Thomas Bocholer, who worked at Menne's. was also missing this afternoon, but his rela tive, have not been heard from tonight. The injured are: - Katie McGarvey, leg broken, internal in juries. . - • Theresa Holthaus, bruised head, face and arms. : - - - Edward Inlnger. body braised. Lillle Greuewald, slightly injured. .: Maj. Hughes, cut .about the head; condi tion critical. - Patrick Sheedy, ladderman No. 1 hook and ladder company, badly cut about wrist and arm, _. - Alice Grimes, candy maker, Internal in juries. James Nuuktt, engineer of the "Fives," in ternal injuries, and injured . about the hips and spine. - Henry Weaihirford, fireman, sprained wrist. I'o.v the fires originated is still un certain in botli cases. There were only two ottice fires at the Boone Paper com pany's building, and it is certain the flames originated at neither of these. At Menne & Co.'s a number of fires were burning, but noue account for the starting of the conflagration. It is now doubtful if there was an explosion at Bambergsr, Strong & Co.'s "next door to the Boone company, at the time the firemen were caught. It was more probably falling walls. Losses and Insurance. Losses and insurance are as follows: Boone Paper company. loss on stock, $75,000; insurance, $49,000; Boone Pa per company, building, owned by A.
