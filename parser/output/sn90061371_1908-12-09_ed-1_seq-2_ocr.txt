Two-thirds of it comes from the Thames, the rest from artesian wells. The Panama canal is one-third com pleted. Evidently there is more work going on than talk In the enterprise under its present management. Overcrowding in Scotland Is not so bad as it used to be. The proportion living more than four per room fell from 18.67 per cent, ta 1861 to 9.56 in 1901. We would be deeply Interested in Mme.

Of tin 1,125,000 persons In Berlin who support themselves or themselves and families only B8.611, or less than 54 per cent, have incomes of $714 or moro a year. About 1,066,000 have less than that amount and more than half of these even less than $214 a year. A distinguished Methodist preacher, Rev. Charles Goodell. expresses a somewhat prevalent 'notion when he rises to remark that If the superfluous money of Mr. Carnegie and of Mr. Rockefeller Is really tainted it is in cumbent on the churches to take it and relieve It of its taint. Prof. Goodwin jot New York, who thinks that the organization of the public schools of the largest cities must be revolutionised, says that he would form the pupils into groups, one for learning trades, another for prepa Uon for commercial 'life, and a third for the college and university. It is so easy for a ten-yeanold boy to de cide whether he is going to be haberdasher or a minister! A Japanese lady of rank, who has been traveling In this country, says American women are unhappy and dls contented, and she ascribes this to the fact that they are so well taken care of that they miss In their lives the stimulating Influence of a little neg lect. The Inference Is that if their husbands beat them now ;and then they would fee more in a position to appreciate their happiness. An election board chairman in $Jew York made trouble lor a woman suf fragist when she tried to register late- ly. She camped oh lis trail, found. out he had a home in New Jersey, lay in wait for him to vote, and had him ar rested and deprived of his vote .and his Job on the ground that he was a non resident. So much for what a woman can do, even in pontics, when abe makes up her mind to get even. . Why should the merits of the .pro posed model husband contest In (Chi cago be based solely on their (com parative speed in buttoning up the backs of the embroidered shirt waists of their respective wives? Has the good temper displayed by them while performing the task and their Deafly compliance in undertaking it as often as requested nothing to do with it? Yea, rather! "While the southern states suffer the stigma of night riders we cannot Justly point the finger of scorn at any nation on earth," says the Pilot. And while there Is so mnch crime and law lessness here in the north none of tts can afford to point the finger of scorn at the southern states. Pointing the finger of scorn is poor business, any way, remarks the Boston Globe. It is a great deal better to be charitable to our neighbor's shortcomings and to do all In our power to correct our own. Every American girl is a queen, ac cording to the old song, but they can not all have warships to accompany them on their Journeys back to the homes of their husbands, like some that might be mentioned. In the presence of an ordinary crop failure one may remain unmoved, but it is grievous indeed to learn that the recent forest fires will cause a short age of Christmas trees.

HEAR MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT DOCUMENT FROM CHIEF EXECU TIVE READ IN CONGRESS. URGES CHANGES ITJ LAWS Present Currency System Declared Imperfect Control of Corporations the Province of the National Gov ernment Conduct of Labor Lead ers Criticised For Postal Savings Banks. Washington. In his message to congress, read in both houses Tues day, President Roosevelt makes im portant suggestions as to what he considers necessary legislation. The president congratulates the na tion on its present excellent financial standing, but calls attention to the need of remedying defects In the cur rency system. He says: The financial standing of the nation at the present time is excellent. and the financial management of the na tion's Interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system is imperfect, and it is ear nestly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901. to September 30, 190S, there was an increase in the amount of money in circulation of 1902,991.399. The increase in the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within this time there were several occasions when It was necessary for the treasury de partment to come to the relief of the money market by purchases or redemp tions of United States bonds; by increas ing deposits in national banks: by stim ulating additional issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur rency system has made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907 immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By the mid dle of November the available working balance in the treasury had been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing house associations throughout the coun try had been obliged to resort to the expedient of Issuing clearing house cer tificates, to be used as money. In this emergency It was determined to invite subscriptions for $50,000,000 Panama canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent. certificates of indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13. 1898. It was proposed to redeposit In the national banks the proceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circu lating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 of the Panama bonds and $15, 436.500 of the certificates of indebtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901. to September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906, and 1907. and a deficit in the years 1904. 1905. 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of $99,283,413.54. The finan cial operations of the government during this period, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures, re sulted in a net reduction of the interest bearing debt of the United States from $987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting In the aggregate to $54,631,980, and an issue of three per cent, certificates of indebtedness under the act of June 13, 1898, amounting to $15,436,500. Refunding operations of the treasury department under the act of March 14, 1900, resulted In the conver sion into two per cent, consols of 1930 of $200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of interest. A decrease of $8,687,956 in the annual interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during the seven years and three months there has been a net sur plus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the interest-bearing debt by ninety millions. In spite of the extraordinary ex pense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest chnrge. The message reiterates the well known views of the president that the control of great corporations, espe cially the railroads of the country, should be vested in the national gov ernment. He says: I believe that it is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is Bone by the Sherman anti trust law, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and un equally, and its enforcement works al most as -much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are In the interest of the public, but Bhall at the same time give to some agency in the national government full power of -control and supervision over them. The railways .of the country should be put completely under the interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that It could exercise complete supervision and control over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at .least, this power should be summary. Rates must be made as low as is compatible with giving prop ter returns to -all the employes of the rail road, from the highest to the lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders, but they must not, for instance, be re duced in stiff i fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the employes or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Interests of the Wageworker. Turning to conditions affecting the wageworker and the man of small means, the -president says: Postal Savings banks will make it eay for the poorest to keep their sav ings Ijb absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways mast be such that they Bhall serve all people with equal justice. -Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make it far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of child la bor. v..mimition of women labor, short ening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as la possi ble discouraged. There should be a progressive inheritance tax on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. There should no longer be any paltering with the question of taking care of the wageworkera who, under our pres ent Industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out .s part of the regular Incidents of , given busi ness. As far as concerns those who have been worn out. I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing; old-age pen sions have been taken in many of our private industries. These may be in definitely extended through voluntary association and contributory .schemes, or through the agency of savings basks, as under the Massachusetts Plan. Urgent Need of Reform. Our present system, or rather no sys tem, works dreadful wrong, and Is of benefit to only one class of people the lawyers. When a workman Is injured what be needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through Immediate administra tive action. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or "consti tutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to interfere with this and similar movements. ' I renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour , day should as rapidly and as far as practi cable be extended to the . entire work being carried on by the government; the present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present wording of the act seems to exclude. Judges Too Poorly Paid. Coupled with a eulogy of the Ju diciary of the nation the president urges that, beginning with the su- , preme court, the judges should have their salaries doubled. As was to be expected, the attitude assumed by certain labor leaders dur ing the recent election comes in for bitter criticism. The president as serts that demands made on congress for legislation were unjust and im practical and could but work harm to the cause of labor. While declaring that our judicial system is sound and effective at core, the president says: There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly det rimental to the lights of wage-workers. This is true of all decisions that decide that men are. by the constitution, "guar anteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or improper number of hours, or to work in unhealthy surroundings; and therefore cannot recover damages when maimed in that occupation, and cannot be forbidden to work what the legislature decides is an excessive num ber of hours, or to carry on the work under conditions which the legislature decides to be unhealthy. There is also. I think, ground for the belief that substantial injustice is often suffered by employes in conscquenre of the custom of courts issuing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them for contempt of court in Instances where, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceed ings. Organized labor Is chaflns under the unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Injunction Must Remain. The power of injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its abuse. In substance, provision should be made that no injunction or temporary re straining order issue otherwise than on notice, except where irreparable Injury would otherwise result; and in such case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed pe riod, and. If not then continued after hearing, it should forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered immediately, and the chance of delay minimized in every way. Moreover, I believe that the procedure should be sharply defined, and the judge required minutely to state the particulars both of his action and of his reasons therefor, so that the congress can if it desires examine and investigate the same. Harm Worked by Law. Discussing measures necessary for the proper control of giant corpora tions operating in defiance of law, the president says: Real damage has been done by the manifold and conflicting interpretations oi the interstate commerce law. Con trol over the great corporations doing interstate business can be effective only if it is vested with full power in an administrative department, a branch of the federal executive, carrying out a federal law, it can never be effective if a divided responsibility is left in both the states and the nation; it can never be effective If left in the hands of the courts to be decided by lawsuits. The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of gov ernment. Respect for the law is essen tial to the permanence of our institu tions: and respect for the law is largely conditioned upon respect for the courts. It is an offense against the republic to say anything which can weaken this re spect, save for the gravest reason and in the most carefully guarded manner. In no other nation in the world do the courts wield such vast and far-reaching power as In the United States. All that is nec essary Is that the courts as a whole should exercise this power with the far sighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the future while they act in the present. Forest Preservation. The manifest necessity for forest preservation is pointed out as a duty the present generation owes to its de scendants, and the president cites the case of China, where reckless defor estation has resulted in creating des erts, as an object lesson. Inland Waterways. .Immediate action by the present session of congress for the improve ment of our inland waterways the presVent declares to be imperative. He recommends the creation of a per manent commission authorized to co ordinate the work of all the govern ment departments relating to water ways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Postal Savings Banks. Urging the immediate institution of postal savings banks, the message says: I again renew my recommendation for postal savings banks, for deposit ing savings with the. security of the government behind them. The object is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person of mod erate means. It Is believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought into circulation through the in strumentality of the postal savings banks. Parcel Post. The much-discussed advisability of the establishment of a parcel post service is thus dealt with: In my last annual message I com mended the postmaster-general's recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the country storekeeper, and It is desirable that the routes, serving more than 15,000.000 people, should be utilized to the fullest practicable extent. Education. Dealing with the important subject of education, the president says: With the limited i.ieans hitherto pro vided, the bureau of e ducatlon has rendered efficient service, but the con gress has neglected to adeo. tely sup ply the bureau with means i , meet the educational growth of the country. I earnestly recommend that this un fortunate state of affairs as regards the national educational office be reme died by adequate appropriations. This recommendation is urged by the repre sentatives of our common schools and great state universities and the leading educators, who all unite in requesting favorable consideration and action by tbe congress upon this subject. The president points out the neces sity of better organization of the vari ous bureaus responsible for the public health, and urges the placing of all soldiers' homes under the jurisdiction of the war department. Statehood. On the question of statehood the president says: ' I advocate the Immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. This should be done at the present session of the congress. The people of the two ter ritories have made it evident by their votes that they wilt not come in as one state. The only alternative is to admit them as two. and I trust that this will be dope without delay. An International agreement con cerning interstate fisheries is at pres ent being attempted, and in this con nection the message continues: I call the attention of the congress to the importance of the problem of the fisheries in the Interstate waters. On the Great Lakes we are now, under the very wise treaty of April U of this year, en deavoring to eome to an international agreement for the preservation and sat isfactory use of the fisheries of these wa ters which can not otherwise be achieved. Lake Erie, for example, has the richest fresh water fisheries in the world; but It is now controlled by the statutes of two nations, four states, and one province, and this province by two different ordi nances in different counties. All these political divisions work at cross pur poses, and in no case can they achieve protection to the fisheries, on the one hand, and Justice to the localities s-ad in dividuals on thti other. Country's Foreign Policy. This nation's foreign policy is based on the theory that right must be done between nations precisely as between individuals, and in our actions for the last ten years we have in this matter proven our faith by our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, to wards other nations, as in private life an honorable man would behave to wards his fellows. I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way in which in Japan, in Australia, in New Zealand, and in all the states of South America, the battle fleet has been re ceived on its practice voyage around the world. The American government can not too strongly express its appre ciation of the abounding and generous hospitality shown our ships in every port they visited. Our Southern Neighbors. The commercial and material prog ress of the 20 Latin-American republics is worthy of the careful attention of the congress. The International Bureau of the American Republics is doing a useful work in making these nations and their resources better known to us. and in acquainting them not only with us as a people and with our pur poses towards them, but with what we have to exchange for their goods. Panama Canal Being Rushed. The work on the Panama canal is be ing done with a speed, efficiency and entire devotion to duty, which make It a model for all work of the kind. The men on the Isthmus, from Col. Goethals and his fellow commissioners through the entire list of employes who are faithfully doing their duty, have won their ritfht to the ungrudging respect and gratitude of the American people. For Ocean Man Lines. I again recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891 so that satis- factory American ocean mail lines to South America. Asia, the Philippines, and Australasia may be established. Citizenship for Porto Ricans. I again recommend that American cit izenship be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico. Should Develop Hawaii. I call particular attention to the Ter ritory of Hawaii. The importance of those islands is apparent, and the ned of improving; their condition and de veloping their resources is urgent. Progress in the Philippines. Real progress toward self-government Is being made in the Philippine islands. I trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the Filipinos can decide for themselves whether It Is well for them to become Independent, or to continue under the protection of a Btrong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the Islands order at home and protection from foreign invasion. Good Work Done in Cuba. In Cuba our occupancy will cease In about two months' time; the Cubans have in orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and the Island will be turned over to them. Our occu pation on this occasion has lasted a lit tle over two years, and Cuba has thriv en and prospered under it. Our earnest hope and one desire is that the people of the island shall now govern them selves with Justice, so that peace and or der may be secure. The National Guard. Urging continued efforts to in crease the efficiency of the National Guard the president continues: Now that the organized militia, the National Guard, has been incorporated with the army as a part oi the national forces, it behooves the government to do every reasonable thing in its power to perfect its efficiency. It should be assisted in its instruction and other wise aided, more liberally than hereto fore. The continuous services of many well-trained regular officers will be essential in this connection. bill is now pending before the congress creating a number of extra officers in the army, which if passed, as it ought to be, will enable more officers to be trained as instructors of National Guard and assigned to that duty. In case of war it will be of the utmost importance to have a large number of trained officers to use for turning raw levies into good troops, The Army. As regards the army I call attention to the fact that while our junior offi cers and enlisted men stand very high the present system of promotion by seniority results in bringing into the higher grades many men of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. No man should regard it as his vested right to rise to the highest rank in the army any more than in any other profession. It is a curious and by no means creditable fact that there chould be so often a failure on the part of the public and its representa tives to understand the great need, from the standpoint of the service and the nation, of refusing to promote re spectable. elderly incompetents. The higher places should be given to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least seniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress of modern industrial com petition no business firm could succeed if those responsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground that they were the oldest people in its em ployment; yet this is the course advo cated as regards the army, and re quired by law for all grades except those of general officer. As a matter of fact all of the best officers in the highest ranks of the army are those who have attained their present post tion wholly or in part by a process of selection. Japanese Exposition. The Japanese government has post poned until 1917 the date nf the great international exposition, the action be ing taken so as to insure ample time in which to prepare to make the expo sition all that it should be made. The American commissioners have visited Japarw and the postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Amerl ca to be represented nt the exposition. Not since the first international expo sition has there been one of greate importance than this will be. marking. as it does, the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the throne of the em peror of Japan. The extraordinary leap to the foremost place among the nations of the world made by Japan during this half century is something unparalleled in all previous history. For More War Vessels. The navy is the last subject dealt with. In that connection the presi dent says: I approve the recommendations of the general board for the in crease of the navy, calling especial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and colliers, and above all. of the four battleships. It is desir able to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of the best existing type. I most earnestly recommend that the general board be by law turned into a general staff. There Is literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing the pres ent bureau organization of the navy. The navy should be treated as a purely mili tary organization, and everything should be subordinated to the one object of se curing military efficiency. A system of promotion by merit, either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both processes, should be introduced, 

PROVED BY TIME. No Fear of Any Further Trouble. David Price, Corydon, Ia says: "1 was in the last stage of kidney trouble lame, weak, run down to a mere skeleton. My back was so bad I could hardly walk and the kidney secre tions much disor dered. A week after I began using Doan's Kidney Pills I could walk with out a cane, and as I continued my health gradually returned. I was so grateful I made a public statement of my case, and. now seven years have passed, I am still perfectly well." Sold by all dealers. 50c a box. Fos- ter-Milburn Co., Buffalo, N. Y. THE TIE THAT BINDS (SOME). Affecting Reconciliation Between Two Really Loving Hearts. There is a certain couDle who de cided to separate awhile ago. It seemed that they were not affinities, after all, and life together was unen durable, so the wife packed up ier be longings and was preparing for a trip home. At the time of parting she picked up their little pet dog and tucked him under her arm. while her other managed the suit case. VVhy, you're not going to taka Trixy!" exclaimed the husband. Of course I am." she announced. "I couldn't live without him." "Well, I can't let the little fellow go," he insisted. "And I simply won't leave him." she declared. So they argued for half an hour, at the end of which she decided to stay, and unpacked to cook dinner, at which Trixy was the guest of honor. THE QUARREL. Her Why on earth did you every marry me? Him Oh, don't be so bromidic! That's what everybody asks. Expert Pocket-Picking. An old lady was accosted in a Lon don street by a well-dressed and re fined-looking stranger, who effusively claimed her as a friend. "I really don't believe you remember me!" she exclaimed, reproachfully, and the old lady, never doubting that her memory was at fault, confessed that she could not quite recall the name. "Ah, but I have changed it since you knew me,' said her interlocutor, gayly, and after a few more lively speeches she passed on, having possessed herself mean' while of the old lady's purse. Not Anxious at AC- "One word of our language that is almost always misused," said the par ticular man, "is 'anxious.' You will hear people exclaim how anxious they are to see a certain play, or anxious to get a new hat, or anxious to take a trip to Europe, when they are not anx ious at all, but eager or desirous. If anxious were used only la the right place we wouldn't hear It half so often." Work with a Will. We are not sent into this world to do anything into which we cannot put our hearts. We have certain work to do for our bread and that is to be done strenuously; other work to do for our delight and that is to be done heartily; neither is to be done by halves or shifts, but with a will; and what is not worth this effort is not to be done at all. John Rusk In. Rewards Constantly Paid. The rewards of great living are not external things, withheld until the crowning hour of success arrives; they come by the way in the con sciousness of growing power and worth, of duties nobly met, and work thoroughly done.

CAUSE AND EFFECT Good Digestion Follows Right Food, Indigestion and the attendant dis comforts of mind and body are cer tain to follow continued use of improp er food. Those who are still young and robust are likely to overlook the fact that, as dropping water will wear stone away at last, so will the use of heavy, greasy, rich food, finally cause Joss of appetite and indisestion. Fortunately many are thoughtful enough to study themselves and note the principle of Cause and Effect in their daily food. A N. Y. young wom an writes her experience thus: "Sometime ago I had a lot of trouble from indigestion, caused by too rich food. I got so I was unable to di gest scarcely anything, and medicines seemed useless. "A friend advised me to try Grape Nuts food, praising it highly, and as a last resort I tried it. I am thankful to say that Grape-Nuts cot only re lieved me of my trouble, but built me up r jd strengthened my digestive or gans so that I can now eat anything desire. But I stick to Grape-Nuts."

HE FOUGHT IN MANILA BATTLE Some of His Relatives Live in St. Louis He Began With the Navy in 1860. New York, N. Y. Rear Admiral Joseph Bullock Coghlan of "Hoch der Kaiser' fame, who has been one of the most distinguished officers in the American navy, died suddenly Satur day at the home of Charles Chamber lain, Sutton Manor, New Rochelle. Ad miral Coghlan walked about the streets of New Rochelle Friday even ing and greeetd a number of friends. He- seemed to be in excellent health at that time. Heart disease is sup posed to have caused his death. Since June 1. 1907, when he retired from the navy, Admiral Coghlan had been engaged in business. He had a host of friends in New York, men who admired him for his bravery, and also because of the determined stand he took at Manila during the Spanish- American war. Admiral Coghlan was married in 1868 to Julia Barbour of Terre Haute, Ind. He leaves one son, Graham Coghlan. . Admiral Coghlan was a half-brother of Philip E. Coghlan of St. Louis and a cousin of former Lieut. Charles P., John D. and Col. Dick Johnson, and has relatives in Belleville. He was born in Frankfort, Ky., in 1844. His father was of Irish parentage. He was appointed to the navy from Illi nois in 18C0. He was graduated from the naval academy in 1SG3. May 23 of that year he became an ensign and two years later was made a mas ter. The following year he became lieutenant, and in 1868 lieutenant- commander. In 1882 he was made a commander. He became a capt-a in 1S9G. Coghlan was given command of the Raleigh in Asiatic waters and took part in the battle of Manila bay. May 1, 1898. Tbe next day he led expedi tions to reduce all Spanish batteries at the mouth of the bay. In July of that year he commanded an expedition at the capture of Isla Grande, Subig bay, Luzon. In 1902 he became com mander of the North Atlantic station TRIES ANTI-TYPHOID SERUM. Physician Tells of Inoculating Self, In terne and Nurses. Philadelphia, Pa.
