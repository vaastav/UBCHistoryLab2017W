RELATION?. The condition of cur foreign affairs is reas onably satistactory. Mexico continues to be a theatre of civil war. While our political relations with that country have -undergone no change, we have ' at the same time strictly maintained a neu trality between the beligerante. At the request of the States of Costa Rica ' and Nacaragua, a competent engineer ha been authorized to make a survey of the riv ' tr Sac Joan, and the port of Sfa Jnao. It is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions, and caused a clos-, r. " . , : ng of the inter-oceanio transit route, bave J oeen amicawy aujusieu, uu .u . good prospect that the route will soon be re- , onened with an increase of capacity and i adaptation. We conld not exaggerate either (be commercial or the political importance of that great improvement. It would be doing injostice to an impor tant South American State not to acknowl edge the directness, frankness, and cordiali ty wittrwhivh the United States cf Colum bia bave entered into intimate relations with this Government. A claims Convention has been eonstitoUd to siomp lete the unfinished -work of the one which closed ita aedsioo in oQlt .1 The new liberal conititution of Venezuela ; baTing gone into effect, with the universal ' Acquiescence cf the people, the government ' .coder it has been recognized, and diplomat- - ao intercourse bas been opened with it in a cordial and friendly tpirit. The Ion? deferred Aresis land claim bas ' tbeen satisfactorily paid and discharged. " 3Iatual payments bave been made of the - claims awarded by the late joint commission for the settlement of claims between the United States and Peru. .-. .TAo earnest and cordial, friendship coatin--aea to exist between the two countries, and siueh eSbrts as were in my power have been cised to remove misunderstandings and avert "". threatening waf betwefn Peru anl Spain. C Oar telationf are of the most friendly nature with Chili, the Argentine Republic, Bo- " livia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Sal?ador, xad Hayti. ' ' During the past year no differences of any kind bave arisen with any of these Repub lies, and on the other band their sympathies . - with the United States are constantly ex- , preyed with, cordiality and earnestness. , . , The claims arising from the seizure of the cargs of the brig Macedonia, in 1821, bate ' been paid ia fall by the Government of s Chili. - Civil war continues in the Spanish part cf San Domingo, apparently without pros pect of au early close. Offiicial eorrespon- . jdsaia has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives as a pleasieg view of social and ,-.: progress in that RepoLli?;" ' 'IsL jt be exsecta-i t dria "new vigor r-. - 2 -::: -a tosaaacs, uaprJTsa. cy tat rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States. I solicit your authority to furnish to the Republio a gunboat of moderate cost to be reimbursed to the United States by in stalments. Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that State against the native Afri can races, and in Li foe ri an hand it would be more effective in arresting" the African Slave trade tban n squadron in cur own hands. The possession of the least organiz ed naval force would stimulate a generon aoibitition in the Republic, and the confl uence which we should manifest by furnish ing it would win forbearance and favor tow ards the Colony from all civilized nations. The proposed overland Telegraph between America and Europe, by the way of Behr ing's Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the last sesi n, bas been undertaken under very favorable circumstances by an Association of Ameri can citizens, with the cordial goodwill and support as -well cf this Government as of tlmse of Great Briain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most cf the South American States of their appre ciation of the enterprise and their readinesp to co operate in constructing lines tributary J to that world encircling communication. I learn with moch satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication be tween the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has been renewed, with full ex pectation of its accomplishment. Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with en ergy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization. Our very popular and estimable represen tative in Egypt died in April lat. An un pleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office snd the. Government of the Paoha resulted in the suspension cf intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of tha cue censor in the cun'ilat?, an 1 our roliUuns with Egypt, as well as our relations with the Birbary powers, are entirely satisfactory. The rebellion which has been so lueg rac ing in China has bpen snppres d. with the co-operation and offices of thi (J ,vcrri;.;e-.r, and of the other Western o .mm-r -.'i The judicial consular esr.iSlt: -n-e'it tht're has become very diffiouh. .in i mur n, a.i l it will need legislative revision Vi ad.-iPt it to the extension of our omniTc, an J : i t more iniiiuat intercourse wok'.! has t en instituted with the .Government an 1 p-pie of that vast empire. seems to be accepting with harty good will the conventional laws which regu late commercial and social intercourse among the western nations. Owing lo the peculiar situation of Japan, and the anomalous form of its government, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capri cious. Nevertheless good proofs has been effected bv the Ventssrn Powers moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been al lowed or put in course of settleuient.and the inland sea bas been re pened to c immerce. There is reason to believe that then pro ceedings have increased, rather th i. dimin ished the friendship of Jupm towards the United States. THE CONTRABAND TRADE WITH THS FEBEL". The ports of Norf dk. Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by proclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will norz consider whether it is not sifir and more profitable to themselves as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports, than it is to ourus through many hazards and at vast co-"l a contraband trade with other porta whiiih are c'.o-c l. if Lot by actual military occupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade. For mysr-lf, I have no doubt of th power and duty cf the Executive, unior the law of nations, to exclude enemies of tho hu nao rac from an avli;m ir iLe United States. If Cong-As tljlnk tbat pro ceedings in Huch canes lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I n-coinroend thut provision be mile for effectually predentin-' foreign eiav tralers from acquiring ('omicil a" 1 faciiif ies f.r their criminal occupation in our country. Il is possible that if it were a nsw and open question, the maratiiue powers, with the rights they now enjoy, wo'iM not on- ede the privileges of a naval hc-ligrrrnt t the iusurcents of the United States, deitirute as they are, and alwavs have been, equaily of ships of war and cf ports or harbors. I Disloyal emi'sario- have ben ne'ther less assiJious nor more successful during the last year than they wero before that time in their: efforts under favor of that privilege to em- i broil our country in foreign wars.

N'erthe- less unforseen political diffiiiulties hive aris en, especially in Brazilian and British ports and on the northern boundary of the United States, which have required and are like to continue to require, the practice of cflostant vigilance and a jut and conciliatory spirit on the part of the Unite!

The e ouditi 'o of the irlr -v l necessarily come into consider iti u, in n m nection with the question" of limiMMg modifving the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as well as tb regulation of imposts, which were ternpora rily established by the reciprocity treaty o' 5 tli June, 18G4. I ,desire, however t t, underrtfool, while making thia titeuienr that the Colonial authorities of Canada ar -' no, deemed to be intentionally- unjust o onfriendly towards the United States; but. on the, contrary, there is every reason to ex pect that, with the approval of II t Maje ty'a Government,"" they will. take th neces sary measures to prevent new incursions to cress the borders. EMIGRATION." . - ' The act passed at the last session for the encouragemeut of emigration has, so far as was possible, been put into operation. It saeras to need amendment, which, will enable the officers of the Government to pre vent the practice of frauds against the emigrants on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here, a free choice of avocations and places of settle ment. A liberal disposition towards this great National policy is manifested by mot of. the European States, and ought to be, especially n our part, of giving the emi grants effective national protection. I regard our emigrants as one of the principal re rlenifhing streams which are appoiute J by Prmidenre to repair th ravages of internal war, and its wastes of national streng'h and health. All that is necessity to ceotiri the flow of that mream in its present fullness to that enl the Government mur every where make it manifest, that it neither nee lj nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon thoe who come from other lands to cast their lot in our ouutry. riNA.vciAL arraiRS. The financial affairs of Ihe Government have been successfally administeTe 1. During the last year the legislation of the Iat session of Congress has beneficially effected tne revenue, although sufficient time ! has not vet elapsed to experience the full ! efft'ct of several ot the provisions of the Acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.

The great advantage of citi zens being creditors as well as debtors, with relation to the public debt, is obvious. They readily preceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe t themselves The publia debt on the 1st day r,f. July last, although somewhat exceeding the es timate of the Secretary of the Treasury nude to Congress at the commencement of the last session, falls abort of the estimate of that officer made in the proceeding De cember as to the probable amount at the be ginning of this year by the sum of $2,995, 007.31.

Althougti tli pre-ent is ihe i atne Cougre.s, and nearly the came mem hers, and witliou; quesii-miig the widoin : .r patriotism ol thoie who s'ooil in oppoi- i tioo I venture to recommend the reconsid- i eratirvi anl pa-sae ol tne measure at the ; present session Of course ihe abstract ijoes'ion is not changeJ. but an intervening election show- atmo-t certainly thai toe next Coiigre will pass the measure if this , does not. Hence there is only a question ' ol time as to when the proposed amerl- ' rneni will jo to tt.- States for their action, : and a it is io no at all events, may we noi agree thai the soooer ihe be tor ? j Ii is not claimed that the ejection has 1 imposed a duty on member to change ' heir views or their vo'es aoy turl'ier thin, ; a an a Kli'ioriai element to be considered, 1 their judgment may t e affected by i: Ii is the voic ol ihe people, now lor ttie fi'st time ieard upon the quetion; in a 2reat national crisi- like our.- unanimity ol action i inior-g ihn-e se-icipg a common end is very i desiratdd, alino-l imJi-pen itle. aiul yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable, i unless ome dierence shall be paid to ihe ' will nf tlie majority, simply because il ii i the will ol the majority. In this case ihe common end is :he main teoaoce of the Union, and among the ' mean to secure that end, such will, through I the eleriion is most clearly declared in la- ' vor of such a Constitutional amendment The most reliable indication of public pnr po-e in this country, is derived through our ! popular elections. Judging by ihe recent 1 canva asd im re-til1., the purpose of the people within the loyal States to maintain ; the ritegrity of ihe Union was never more firm or more nearly unanimous ihan now. ! The ex raordu.ary calmness and good or der with which the millions ofwoters min- J gled at ihe polls, gave strong assurance of ! ihia. Noi only aii those who supported the f Union lickel. jro called, but a majority ofj the opposing party also may be lairly claim- , vA to entertain and lo be actuated by ihe same purpose I It is an unanswerable argument lo this effect, that no candidates- for any office, h ,wever hi.h or low. has veulurdd to eeek votes on ihe avowal that be was tor giving up the Union There have been moch impnning of mo- ' lives and much hea ed controvery as lo ihe ; proper mean and besi m -de of advancing the Uiiiori cause, but on the dis inci isue of Unjoii or no (I:ion ihe politicians have, shown their inlinctive knowledge that' here is no diversity smong the peop!e. In affordinr to the people the fair opportunity of showing one 1o another and lo the world this firmne-s and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast, importauce to the ; national caste. 1 - The election has exhibited another faci'not less valuable to be known the fact that we do not approacH exhaustion in the most im poraot branch of national resources that of living men While it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves, and carried mourning to so many hearth it is some relief to know that cum pared with ihe surviving, the fallen have been so lew. While corps and divisions, and brigades and regiments, bave formed and (ought, and dwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who cotnposod ihem are Mill living. The same is true of the naval service. The election returns prove this. Sa many voters coaid not e se be found. The States regularly holding election both now, and four years ago. to wit : Cal if'irnia Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois. In diana. Iowa, Kenincky, Miu. Maryland Maac hnseits, Michigan. Niunesota. Mis fouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey. New York Ono, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Maud, Vermont. Western Virginia or Wis-con-in, ca-t 3 9H2.01I vo'es now, against 3.kho,'222 cast then, showing an aggregate now of 3 9-iZ Oil. To this is to be added 33 76? cast now in the new Stales of Kansas and Nevida which States did not vo'e in ISU0, thus svkwiliiiii lite aggregate to 4.015 773, and the net iucreae tin ring the three years and a halt of war to 145,551. a table is appended showing particulars. iu this again should be added the nam tier ol soldier iti the fi-ild from M issachu ens, Khode Island. New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and California who, by the laws of these S'ates, could not vote away irom their homes, and which number can not be le- than ninety thousand Nor i this all. The number in the nnorgauizeJ lerriiories is a inrle naw to what it was tour ears ago, while thousands, white and black, join us as the national armies press back the insurgent lines So much is shown, affirmatively and neg J atively, by (he election. It is not .naterial to inquire how the increase has been pro duced, or ;o show thai it would have been greater, but for the war, which is probably true. The important fact remains demon- rated that we have more men now than when the war began ; that we are not ex haos'eJ nor in process ot exhaustion. That we are gaining strength, and may, it need be, maintain the coniest indefinitely this as to men. Material resources are now more complete and abundant ihan ever. The natural resources, then are unexhaust ed, and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose jo re establish and maintain me national authority is unchanged, arid as we believe, tinchaiigeaPle. The rninnr of continuing ihe conflict remain to c'ioo. On carelul considera tion of all ;he evidence accessible, it seems io me that no a tempt at negotiation wuh ihe insurgent leader could result in any good. He would accept nothing short of sever ance of the Union preciely what we will no: and cannot give. His declarations to tin- eff-ct are expiic.t and oti-re.ieaie.l. He does ii ol atiiempt to deceive us ; ne alfrd ii- uo exc ise to deceive ourselves. He ca .not voluntarily re-arc-'pt the Union. He cannot voluntarily yield il Between 'nm and us the isue is distinct, single, and ii. flexible I' is an is-ue which can only be tried by war and decHed by victory If we yield we are ceaien. It the Southren people fail him fie is beaten Ei'her way it would be the victory and defeat loliowing war What is iru-, however, ot him who heads Ihe in mirgpnt caue, is not necessarily true of those who follow Although he cannot re-accept the Union, they cao. Some of ihem, he knows, alrea dy desire peace and reunion. Th number ot such may increase. They can at any moment have peace by simply laying down their arms andsubmitiing to ihe na tional authority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not, if it would, mai-itain war against ihem The loyal citizens would itol sustain or al low it If qnetions should remain, we would adjust ihem by the peaceful means of leg islation, conferences, courts, and votes, op erating ooly in constitutional and lawtul channels Some certain, and other possible qnes lior.s are and would be beyond the Execu tive power io djot, as, for instance, the admiion of members into Congress, and whatever might require the appropriation cf money. Ihe executive power itself would be grea'ly diminished by the cessation of ac tual war Pardons and remissions of lor-fejtur-s, however, would still be wilhin executive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be exereiseu can be fairly judged of by the paM. A year ago a general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were orlured io all, except cer ain designated cl-ees, and ii was at ihe same time made known that the excepied clas-e were slill within contemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed them selves ot the general provisions, and many more would only that the signs of bad faith in some led to sirch precautionary meas ures as rendered ihe practical process less eay and certain. During ihe same tirre also, special par dons have been granted to individuals of the exceptoJ classes, and no voluntary ap plication has been denied. Thus, practi cally, ihe door has been, for a full year, open to all except 6uch as were not in con dition to make Iree choice; that is, 6uch as wero in custody or under constraint. It i still so opon io a.'l. Uut the time may come when ihe public daly shall demand thai it be closed, and thai in lieu more vig orous measures than heretofore shall be adopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed rs.-ihtance to the national authority on Ihe part of the insurgents, a the on'y indispen sible condition to ending the war on the pan of the Government, I re'.ract nothing here ofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made s year ago, that while I remain io my present position I shall noi attempt io retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation: nor shall I return to slavery any person who is tree by ihe terms of that ptoclarnation, or by any of the acta of Congress. If ihe people should, by whatever word orneaus, make ii an Executive dniy to re ensl?ve such persons, another, and not I, must be iheir instrument to perform it In slating a single condition of peace, I mean simply lo ay that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on the pari of those who be gan it.
