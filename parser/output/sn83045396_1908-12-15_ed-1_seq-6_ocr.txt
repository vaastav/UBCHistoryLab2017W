COMMANDER-IN-OHIEF HERE. I Tho arrival of Commander-in-Chief Novius of the Grand Army of the Re public in this city 'affords Salt Lakers tho opportunity to pay him their re i spocts, aud to show their good will to j the organisation of which ho is tho head. And they aro delighted to wel come, with him, his staff and goodby company. There cannot be tho least doubt of this good will, nor of tho do tormina (ion of Salt Lnko City to make a right showing with respect to its j ability to caro for tho Nntionnl En campment next August iu this city, nnd of tho gtfod will of all the people to wards the Grand Army itself as whole, and of its distinguished repre sentatives who aro now here. Tho Commercial Club has taken the initiative in planning for a banquet to night in honor of these visiting of ficials, makiug Us own annual banquet serviceable for this purpose. Tho club thus comes forward in fine stylo in its initiative for tho city and in its willing sen-ice for this cause. The visit of tho Commander-in-Chief at this time is for tho purpose of look ing over the situation horc and sizing up iho placo as to its ability to care for ihc great crowds that aro duo to attend tho National Encampment of the Grand Army. We aro confident that there will bo no difficulty in convinc ing these oflicors of the Grand Army that tho city is amply ablo to do every thing noccssary in tho way of accom modations and entertainment. This city habitually receives and entertains visitors by many thousands at various times every year. We have had tho National convention of tho Elks, of the Woodmen, and of various orders and societies, and twice a year the groat church conference. To entertain the Grand Arni3' in its National Encamp ment is tho greatest honor of all, and yet this city feels equal to tho occasion, and to provide whatever is neccssnry for the comfort And convenience of the Grand Army as a body in its official aud social work, as well as attending to tho comfort and solace, first, of the Vetera u soldiers themselves, and next of nil that great throng who would naturally wish to bo hero and seo tho votcrans, wit ness their proceedings, aud take iu the whole grand occasion as something to be remembered as long as they shall live. REVERSING THE POSITION. It is curious to seo how shifty aud un scrupulous schemers will change thoir ground on their own motion whou oc casion seems to serve them. An in- l stance in point is the course of tho Smoot "Mouth" with reference to a declaration made in a convention of the American party workors last .Time; viz.: "Neither tho Maj-or nor the head of any department of the citj' govern ment, nor tho City Couneil, is re sponsible to the people of this city for the faithful and honest management nnd conduct of its affairs." This, of course, meant that the American party, being iu control, was, as a party, held rcsponfiiblo io the people for the admin istration of the municipal affairs of this city. In party government this is necessarily so. It is the party that is hold responsible for the ads of its officials, and the officials thcmselvcH are expected to recognize this fact. Tho language quoted was intended merely to bo a reaffirmation of a principle of common acceptance every where. Whatever is dona in National affairs by the Republican party, the Republican party is responsible for. Whatover matters of State policy aro dono or neglected in Utah, the Repub lican part', through its successive of ficials, must boar tho responsibility. The same in the government of this county: tho Republican party puts in tho of ficials and it i6 responsible for them as a party. The fame in this city: tho American party elects the officials; those officials change from time to time, but the part is responsible ull the time for what thoy do, save where it declares to the contrary. As loug, however, as it suited its pur- ! pose, the Smoot ".Mouth" held this up as an abhorrence, a chain which bound the officials, restricted their liberty, and was a thing to he spurned b' every official of independent mind aud of per sonal initiative. It was urged that American officials should disregard the wish of their party, do aa thoy pleased, and throw off all part- responsibility. Now, however, in the matter of the i red-light district, the Smoot "Mouth" has ".ti rely changed its attitude. It is not the official who is responsible 3t all, but it is the American party. It is constantly iterating and reiterating that tho establishment of tho red-light dis trict, or stockade, is au American party proposition- This is not ouly a com plete reversal of its own position on tho doctriuo stated above in quotation, but it is an utterly false and impudent dis tortion of fact, with regard to the Amer ican party. Tho American party, wher ever it has spoken, has in the most em phatic terms condemned tho establish ment of any red-light district- It has fpoken repeatedly on that proposition, and repudiated altogether any and all connection with it, aud opposed it throughout. The ouly authprity under which the company that is Baid to be putting in that red-light district acts is a State authority, under an administra tion of tho Republican party. And 3'et, although that administration has been called upon to annul the State authority under which tho incorporat.iou has pre ceded, both the Republican Govoruor and tho Republican Attorncy-Gcuernl have absolutely refused to act. If any party at all is responsible for tho estab lishment of tho red-light district on the West Sido of this city it is therefore tho Republican party. It is certain that the American parly has repudiated it; it. is certain that the Democratic party, rep- resented by tho Democratic Women's club, has protostcd against it; tho only party that lias absolutely gave it life, fostered it, and declined to interfero with it in any way, is tho Republican Wc uoto especially tho change of front in tho Smoot "Mouth" on this matter, becauso of its perversion yes ' lerday morning of the action of tho min isters of this city in preaching against tho red-light district. Tho "Mouth'' was extremely busy in trying to per vert the moral and entirely proper at titude, of tho ministers ou this quostion into a political proposition, wherein thoso ministers are, by its misrepresen tation, assumed to be condemning the American party. Nothing of that kind can' fairly bo assumed, unless the as sumption also goes with it that the min isters woro ignorant or biased in regard to this matter. But ns this is not tho case, since tho ministers know perfectly all that has boon said and dono with re gard to this matter, and since it is im possible that they could have in this any bins ngainst tho Auiorican party, and .is thoy properly confined their crit icisms to tho offending officials, the wholo onus of this misdirected, turn coat tactics on tho part of tho Smoot "Mouth" must recoil upon itself; its effort is ' to cram a lio down the throats of the public and mako thorn bcliove that, tho American party is re sponsible for a thing which that party has utterly ropudinted. And incidental!' tho Smoot "Mouth" goes back upou its own proposition and now endorses tho sentiment that "neither tho Mayor, nor tho bond of auy department of the city government, nor tho City Council, is responsible to tho people of this city for tho faithful and honest management and condect of its affairs," and it spe cifically acts from that basis. Since, however, thnt has boon an ab horrence of tho Smoot "Month" ever 6inco last June, tho conclusion is evi dent that tho Smoot "Mouth" has no principle in this niattor whatever, has no fixed opinions, but bimply stands ready to use whatevor comes forward, both approvingly in ono case and dis approvingly in the other, according ns the opportunities of its vile and un principled warfare may suggest. Thero is no possible ebauco to ally the American party with tho red-light district. That part' has uniformly and consistently and repeatedly condemned it. Tho necessary soquence, from tho point of view that, the "Mouth" has heretofore urged, is that auy offouding officials, and not tho American party, must bo held responsible for what thoy do. Aud yet exactly contrary to its former position on this aud ignoring the main facts all through, tho "Mouth" says uothing about any, wrongheaded lies on tho part of officialdom, but Jays tho wholo niattor at the door of the American party. Tho utter insin cerity in aud falsehood of its attitude, the double-dealing and two-faced hj-poe-risy involved in it nil is perfectly evi dent to the public, which knows pre cisely where watcvur blame tljorc is rests and will lay it thero accordingly. A UAH BROUGHT, TO BOOK. Tho Deserot News camo through last night with an admission that it lied about The Tribune wheu 'it said that this paper did not coudomn Chief Pitt's report to the Council with reference to the red-light district "uutil lator." And that was the particular, specific lio wc called it to account for, and which it now directly admits was a lie. But, characteristically, it endeavors to sustain its infamy by stating that The Tribune has held disreputable views about saloons nnd brothels, nnd has not changed its position with regard to thorn. The Tribune has not chauged its position with regard to them, of course; because it has never had any other opinion than a straight, decent opinion. On I his, as on ull other mat ters, Tho Tribune believes in the su premacy of the law and the extirpa tion of vice aud crime, wherever found. In apparent backing up of its opin ion, the News says, "Years ago it rep resented fcuch places as potent agents of freedom." Which lias boon threshed out recently bctweeu The Tribune aud tho News, and tho Nnws was proved to be an utter liar in mak iug this representation Going back, however, to the matter of "j'cars ago," wo may put the church organ iu mind of the fact that "years ago" it .sustained the police of t bis city in their opeuing houses of ill-fame with poep-holcs so that the lecherous beasts of polygamy could go there and feast their eyes, gloating upon occurrences therein. Those houses wore established officially by the city, paid for by tho public's money, und were conducted under tho supervision, man agement, and patronage of the police, all being at a time when Mormons were in complete control. This is a fact thnt has never been denied, nnd never can bo denied. It was an in famy that was supported by tlnj church organ, and that organ has never, so far as wc know, recanted its indorse ment of that utterly vile and indoccnt campaign directed prctondedly against tho Federnl officials in this city in order to trap hem into vico so that the' could be made subsorvienfc tools of tho church. So much for rofcrence to "years ago," in which the church organ lies again and again about The Tribune, and in which its oVii infamous guilt is fully established. And coming down to tho rod-light district of present dis cussiou, we venture to say that The Tribune has had teti words of unre served condomuatiou of it to ono word that has appeared in the organ of tho Mormon church. It is, however, a dis tinct advance in tho cause of decency to sec that the News admits that it lies nbout Tho Tribune. This advance, however, is clogged by the fact that tho News misrepresents what wo said last January about Pitt's report, as it , quotod only ono paragraph, and in its undertaking to show that tho denun ciation rolnted only to tho official cs tablishmont of tho Pitt proposition by this city; whereas our condemnation was directed against tho. wholo system involved in the red-light district thou, and it is unreservedly directed against it now. Aud now that tho News has pro gressed so far aa to admit in a snarl ing, mendacious way, thnt it lied in ono respect nbout The Tribuno, wo call its attoution to tho other points named iu our editorial of yestordny morning, whoro it also has boon guilty of tho like slander and fnlsohood, and invito it to eomo to the front also ou thoso points. THE 

NATIONAL FINANCES. It appears from tho report of Secre tary Cortolyou, of tho Treasury .De partment, that tho Govornmont is facing for tho present fiscal year, end ing Juno 30th next, a doficit of $114, 000,000. This seems to bo an enormous defnult, but yet the Government hns a good deal more than that on deposit in tho National banks, bosides the working balances which it kcops in the treasury itself for mooting daily ob ligation?. Still, it is manifest that this sort of thing c'ould uot go ou long with out making serious complications and difficulties. Secretary Cortolyou points out as tho great causo of the trouble the "lno.lt of system, in preparation of the budget, which is subject, to no busi ness control." Tho Treasury Depart ment, which has to moot tho responsi bilities in connection with tho handling of tho National finances, has littlo to say about making up tho lists of ex penditures. Congress recognizes no power or authority besides itself in making up tho annual appropriations. These consist, first of all, of tho esti mates made by tho departments as to the amount of money needed for con ducting tho business transacted nudor their jurisdiction; tbe?o aro generally out down. But all is fixed by Congress, members of tho Houso horn and thero insisting upon having certain amounts put iu for their particular localities, and tho Senators exceeding tho mem bers of tho House in contesting to swell the National appropriations for local purposes. From tho administrat-ivo standpoint, tho Secretary is quite corroct in insist ing that there ought to be n financial responsibility connoctod with tho Treasury Dopartmcut, similar to that connected with the ministerial respon sibilities in Europe with respect to revenues und expenditures. But from the popular standpoint the matter is approached iu quite a difforcnt spirit. Congress docs uot get at tho matter of appropriatious iu any spirit of the bookkeeper, but of tho ucods of tho country, of mooting those needs, aud of using the Treasury Department merely as a clearing house to carry out the Congressional will. It is manifest that this is an cutirely different point of view from that takon by the re sponsible minLstors of Europe, and also uow voiced hero by Secretary Cortol you. And ns Congress is not in tho least likely to chango its methods in this respect, nor is it at all apparent that the people wish those mothods changed, it is idlo to talk nbout it. !or tho presout it is manifest that thero is plenty of money on hand, and it will do no harm if tho Govornmont proceeds to draw out of tho National banks aud uso for current, uccds tho money now deposited iu thoso bauks without any particular a'dvantaco to tho Govcrnmont. The Secretary calls atleution to tho oxtraordinary increase in public ex penditures in tho last thirty years. In 187S the ordinnry expenses of the Gov ornment were $13"i,000,000; in 100S thoy aro $035,000,000; an iucroaso of nearly 100 per cent in the thirty years. Ho is probably right in his conclusion from tho bureaucratic point of view, that a good deal of this increase might hnvo boou stopped. But inasmuch as Con gress ropresouts the pcoplo and un doubtedly to a greater exteut thuu anj other authority in the Government cau possibly do, is carrying out. the popular will, it is probnblo that Secre tary Cortolyou ?s plea for an imprac ticable cheek upou Congress must fall to tho ground. No check would reach Congress except tho popular disapproval of its nets and tho retirement of those members who have mado themselves ob noxious by appropriations disapproved by tho poople. And his further sug gestion that Congress vest in a joint committee tho revision of tho appropri ations with roferenco to tho current revenue, will probably be ns ineffective as his other recommendations. The members of such committco would take caro of their owu intorcsts, first of all, and let the other members whistle. Another absolutely impracticable suggestion by tho Secretary is for in ternational gold certificates usable tho world around. This 'is impracticable for two reasons: First, on account of the differences in the money standards of difforcnt peoples; nnd, socondly, bo causo international complications, or oven war, might lead to tho confisca tion of tho gold reserves jii6t. when thoso holding certificates might want thoir gold. Tho Secretary calls attention to tho immense hoards of gold in the Treas ury, amounting now to $807,071,800, upon which the Treasury issues gold certificates. Theso certificates, of courso, are good for gold anywhere thoy are presented. But the quostion arises, why should tho United States do this sort of a banking business'? If tho poople want to deposit their gold, why not lot them do it in banks und trust companies, and not in the Treasury of the United States? It docs not appear that this country derives any advantage from thoso hoards of gold. The United States is put to tho oxponso of printing gold certificates nnd accounting for the inonoy nil tho time, but dare not use any of it nnd doos not use any of it, becauso it is liable to bo called for by tho depositors. If, however, the Treas ury did uso it at all. it would be doing, in effect, a bauking business. And tho Treasury would bo, as in a way nud to all practical purposes in this inatlor it is, a great bank of deposit. Whatever advantages may bave ac crued in tho past by tho Tronsury's rccoption of gold and issue of gold cer tificates upon deposits, this odvantngo is now a thing of tho past. Tbo United States should not go into tho banking business in this way any moro than in any other. And wo boliovo that a good deal of the currency trouble of this coun try is traceable to this one thing of tho United Statos inviting the hoard ing of gold in its Treasury whore it a an inactive lump, in placo of requiring tho owners of that gold to deposit it whoro it could bo used in tb9 financial and business affairs of tho country. Wo do not boliovo that the Secre tary's report will havo much effect upon Congress in the way of reducing appropriations. Thero is plenty of mouey on hand, and is likely to bo for somo years to come, for even extrava gant appropriations; and as long as this is tho case thero will be no par ticular disposition towards economizing. Tbo Republicans do not want to do it becauso they on joy tbo spending of the money and tho benefits the party derives from such expenditure. The Doraocrats do not want to do it. be causo thoy want their share of thoso expenditures, too; aud tbey get them even while protesting in Congress against oxtravaganecs, and demanding the strictest economy in conducting the affairs of the Governmont. As a mat ter of fact, tho Treasury is in a very good and strong condition, aud there j is not tho least occasion for alarm. 

GOING ABROAD FOR LIGHT. We have obout two thousand men and women out In various parts of thi world preaching the gofpcl.

Thus thero aro more of our young people becoming acquainted with the ways of the world and bringing homo theso now Ideas to better nnd elevate those among whom they live. Elder J. A. Armstrong In Hutchlnaon (MJnn.) Leader. Elder Armstrong appears to havo been tho leader of a party of seven Mormon missionaries who called at tho office of the newspaper indicated. Ho desired an opportunity of expressing his views through the columns of that paper, which was granted; and the quo tation made is from his own writing, according to the Leader. The view expressed by Elder Arm strong is not orthodox, if wc undor staud Mormon orthodoxy at all and wo believe that wo do. While Mr. Armstrong gives to the world credit for possessing ideas that nre valuable and that arc copied by tho Mormon people with beneficial results, the teach ing of the higher Mormon authority is to the contrary. The chief thought of comfort giveu to the Mormon pcoplo by thoir leaders is that thoy have como out of the world in ordor to avoid tho things of tho world that they havo separated themselves from the remainder of mankind for the purposo of purging themselves of tho hnbits and customs of humanity. They nro taught to believe that all the systems of men nro contrary to the order of heaven, nnd that imitation of these systems must be avoided as productive of sin fulness. In no oue thing is the Mor mou church aud its theories and prac tices hold to bo inferior to what the leaders call man-made systems of the world. As an instance in point, speaking concerning this great suporiority claimcd by tho Mormon priesthood, and which appears to furnish cause for questioning tho statement made by El der Armstrong, we present the follow ing: I would not care If there was not n Blblo within ton thousand miles of this place, or any other book or ncrlp: bore aro the oracles living right in our midst, and wu receive them from day to day, by word of mouth from a living man. an apostle who Is alive, and through n priesthood , that Is living In our mldBt. I'rom eorm'on of President llcber C. Kim ball In the Salt Lake tabernacle. January 27, lS5t; Journal of Discourse?, volume 2. page 197. inc Aiormon cnurcn is to oe con gratulated upon tho fact that the younger element of that body are out growing the old uonsonso; but this very fact destroys one of its chief founda tions it repudiates tho idou that tho leaders aro inspired men who can make no error when speaking under pretend ed divino guidance. Tho idea that any thing whatever can be lenrned froju tho "outsido world" undermines the the ory that iu the Mormon church God has set up His kingdom on tbo earth und established :i system which is di vine, and thnt all others are creations of mon, containing such fatal elemonts of error that dissolution or destruction must be their final fate. But it appears that the Mormon ciders failed to make much of an im pressiou upon the editor of the Minne sota paper, either with thoir religious views or tho expression of an opinion that there is somoj possible good In tho world outside of Mormouism. This is what hosays: It Is not our mission to floor tho mild Mormon buys when thoy make us a pleaa iint call, hut If Lhey must talk to us wc will hand them out tho goods we havo on our shelves, and right along we pro no50 to sustain homo Industries such ns Hutchlnaon churches, which ure turning out aa good a quality of religion ns can bo found anywhere, not excepting Utnli. Nowadays the lot of tho Mormnu mis sionary is hard indcod, nnd he is able to mako but littlo progress iu bis work. And who can bo surprised at this when ono comes to remember the exposures that have been made of gross evil ex isting in the lives of tho "oracles" of whom President Kimball boastod, und from whom the Mormon mission ary is expected to draw bis inspira- J tion? THE 

PRESIDENTIAL INSULT. "Wo print lower in this column au explanation of the practices which led up to the enactment by Con gross of the nmendmout to the appro priation bill of last, year, that, secret service agents wcro not to be detailed from thoir proper employ and loaned to various departments of the Govern ment. It will be remembered that President Roosevelt denounced this amendment to tho appropriation bill as diroctly in the interest of criminals, and put it right up to the members of Congress not only that they were help ing criminnls by such legislation as this, but that some of them woro liablo to bo put in tho criminal class themselves. As an instance in point, bo cited tho casos of a Senator from Oregon and a Representatives from tho samo State. It is no wonder that Congress is stirred to the doopest indignation upon this apparently studied, direct, and wanton insult. Tho Houso has already taken up tho matter and adopted a resolution to appoint a committco to point out what should be dono for the vindication of tho honor of that body from tho President's imputations. It is understood that tho Senate will take like action later on. And certainly tlnj President's language is something tliat Congross can hardly ignore under the circumstances, and in its''ndication of its honor we do not see Vjfiat reply the President can make. For the imputa tion on this matter in his message con veyed scandalous and gratuitous in sult?, beyond anything that has ever boeu passed npon Congress before by any executive of tho United States. The Red Rag to the Congressional Bull From Washington Dispatch to the Boston Globe. Thro.o:qnarters of tho long document had been road to inattentivo cars, when suddenly the pot began to bubble, when tho president referred to the law passed by the last Congress restricting tho oporations of the secret service. To make what follows understood it is necessary to say that many rears ago Congress created a body of detec tives known as secret sendee mon. un der the control of the secretary of tho treasury, but immediately under the chargo of a chief of the secret service, whoso sole duties were to prevent coun terfeiting and arrest counterfeiters. For many years this law was strictly observed, b'ut after the assassination of President Garfield it was thought neces sary that tbo person of the president should be guarded, and as Congress re fused to make any appropriation for the direct safety of the president, and there was no fund out of which detec tives or secret ?crvico men could be paid, men of tho secret service corps were detached from their regular du; ties an ncted as the secret police of the president. At first- oue or two men were detailed for this duty, tben the scopo of the work was enlarged uutil the prosidont uovor stirred out of tho White House, whothcr fqr a walk or a drive or a railroad journoy. without secret service men at bis heels. After tho assassination of President McKinloy still greater precautions were taken, and now the president is not only accompanied by secret service men wherever he may go. whether to church or to make a social call, but. de tectives sit nil day long in the White House closoly Scanning every person who enters. CO This, of course, was in direct viola tion of law. Every member of Con gress knew it. but the fact was winked at. The drain on the force of the secret service corps became so heavy that to enable it to attend to its regu lar duties postoffice inspectors were frequently called in to act as the presi dent's private bodyguard: Tho poet; office inspectors, under tho control of the postmaster-general, are to that serv ico what tho secret service men are to the treasury. They arc supposed to be employed only to' run down postal criminals. Tho department of justice also has a force of detectives. t Tbey are known as agents, and officially tbey nre re stricted to the investigation of judicial offenses and the examination of ac counts of marshals, district attorneys and such other matters as como under the control of the department of jus tice. Like the secret service men and the postoffice inspectors, they havo of late yeans been used for other purposes. After the murder of President Mc I Kinley this violation of the law1 became J so flagrant that it wns very objection able to certniu members of Cougress, who bolieved that it was undignified to wink af the open violation of the law. The late Senator Hoar proposed that thero should be a small body of plain-clothes men employed simply to guard the person of the president. But Congress refused to permit, their em ployment because of the mistaken idea that this would expand from a few de tectives into a "presidential body guard." So there was nothing to bo dono except to use tho socrct service men to protoct the prosidont, although Con gress still kept up tho farce of restrict ing tho functions of the secret sorvico to tho suppression and detection of crimes against tho currency. Last year thero was a good- deal of excitement created among members of Congress. It was said that there was a regular "black cnbinct" maintained in Washington and that tbo secret service men, the postoffice inspectors and the agents of the department of justice had been constituted a secret political police a,nd were spying upon members of Congress, prying into their private lives and affairs which was unpleasant for someraembers. Mon who woro opposed to adminis tration policies, it wns said, found themsolves suddenly confronted with things that they hardly cared to have known. Whether truo or false, it de veloped that tho secret force of tho three departments had been "loaned" to other departments and that there was rather an extensive delectivo ma chinery at tho control of the president.
