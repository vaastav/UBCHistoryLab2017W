Leavenworth Times. The confession has been duly made and the official figures given. See our isMie of Sunday, Dec. 18th. The postponement by the senate of action on the nomination of Mr. Lamar to the supreme bench until after the holidays must be humilating to the ap pointee in view of the fact that the enate usually confirms former mem bers of that bod- to appointments without so much as referring the matter to the committee. However, it is a life position and the appointee can afford to wait. The Chicago Tribune prints a dispatch from down east in which ex-Postmaster Joseph llanley of Augusta in the state of Tdaine is reported as saying that, if 31cdill (the Tribune's venerable editor) goes back on James G. Blaine, an oppo sition Republican paper will be started in Chicago within sixt- days. Its com ment on this bit of news is equally terse and enigmatic. "Bring on your bears. Jo!"' it says, "but don't bluff on a pair of deuces!'' The list of delegates to the national convention of Republican clubs in New York last week disclosed many familiar names. The initial movement of the coming national campaign was a most significant one in many ways, but in none more so than showing the utmost harmonv in the party throughout the countiy. and unanimity of purioe to eliminate every species of flummery and go into the fight to win. The augury is certainlv cheering. As soon as Chicago had been chosen as the place for the Republican conven tion, the hotsls weie in receipt of tele grams from committees asking that apartments be reserved for them. J. 13. Chaffee and W. A. Hammel, represent ing the Colorado delegation, wired for the .same rooms as were given them at the last convention. As J. B. Chaffee has been dead and buried some months it could only have been his spirit who did the telegraphing. The first real sjeech of the fiftieth con gress was made by Senator Mori ill of New Hamiahire, being an argument in favor of hi bill to restrict immigration. The subject is one of the most important that will be brought lefoiv congress, and it is wise to make a prompt begin ning. It will be still wiser to modify the law which makes it an offense to hire a skilled artisan on the other side of the water, while it allows the ilosts and Spies and Linggs and the refuse of foreign prisons and asylums to come "in free. The announcement come from Wash ington that the prohibition question will bo given practical consideration and most likely application by the present congress. At a conforenc" of I.opubli can senators on the subject last week it was agreed to begin the national work by pushing a prohibitory bill for the District of Columbia. It is believed that there will be enough Democratic senators who will vote for the measure I to offset any Republicans who may op pose it. Among Democratic senators who are reported as favoring such legis lation are Cockrell. Coiqnitt. Maxey. Morgan. Brown, Reagan, and. last bur not least. Vance, late governor of North Carolina, the same who made the famous remark to the governor of South Caro lina. It is reported that at the confer ence referred to there was general agree ment among the Republicans present that the next national convention should insert a plank denouncing rlif organiza tion or association of brewers, distillers and saloon-keepers, for the purpose or defying or violating the laws, or of op posing the enactment of restrictive legislation. m. a ,a AbKf gaxlxj sT The St. John's Globe, edited by a member of the Canadian parliament, has come out openly in favor of the im mediate annexation of the maritime provinces of Cnnada to the United States, and two or three other prominent journ als of that portion of the dominion have tactitly endorsed the proposition. It is not improbable that this announcement caused the reported hitch in the fisheries negotiations at Washington. There are many reasons why such an union is not desirable to the United States govern ment, whatever may be said in its favor. The entire sheep industry may be counted as a unit in opposition to Cleve land's free trade policy. The latest or ganization of sheep men to be heard from is the Merino Sheep Register association, which met at Jackson. Mich., Wednes day. The association claims that a fur ther reduction of the tariff on wool would kill the sheep 'industry entirely and it points out the fact that the tariff reduc tion of 1S83 did the industry an incal culable damage. Every farmer in the land who grows a pound of wool for market is directly affected by such re duction. There is a strong, probability that the advertised contest of Representative Ar nold's seat will not materialize. His am bitious Rhode Island Democratic con testant finds in Washington a feeling that it might make "trouble to contest a seat, where the seated member has not only a plurality, but a handsome ma jority over his Democratic opponent. Contesting seats in the fiftieth congress is not a business the Democrats want to see engaged in to any very great extent. It is liable to lose them more than they could hope to gain by it. A subscriber to the Leavenworth Times, writing from Logan, Kan., wants to know if it would not be well to "memorialize our senators and repre santatives in congress to pass an act col onizing all those free trade fellows on 'No Man's Land,' and compel them to raise sheep for a livelihood, Cleveland to re pair fences and keep off the wolves.'' If they were permitted to have their way they would certainly need somebody to keep the ''wolf from the door," but we object to No Man's Land being made the corral. It is too good a country to be prostituted to such a purpose. Periodically it is announced that, at a given time, settlers will march into Okla homa and take possession. But, since having some little experience with Uncle Sam's boys, they are not so anxious to do the marching act. Again the time is fixed, but they won't go. It will be some time yet before this "new empire" that is to make Wichita a great city materializes. Hutchinson News. The Eagle spoke its mind several days ago about that proposed forcible occupation of Oklahoma. However, we are of the opinion that that country will be opened, peaceablj. at no very distant day. When it is Wichita will be the greatest beneficiary, in a business way. of any point outside of the terri tory named, and that's what makes our would-be rivals rave. . "Vibratory sympathy" is the latest power or fouce that Mr. Keely's inventive imagination has discovered by which to give momentum to his motor, having discarded tiie etheric principles that he so long held to. The most remarkable faculty held by that genius and that one faculty makes him a genius is the hold he retains upon his financial back ers. Notwithstanding their faith in him has been put to the test of years of fail ure on his part they arc still manifesting undiminished confidence in him by add ing liberally to the fund of five millions hitherto contributed and squandered. Another evidence that the American people like to be humbugged and pay more liberailv for it than something real. A few evening ago some conceit com pany entertained the good folk of New ton with a musical entertainment which for lack of life and prightliness gave the editor of the Republican the fidgets and he described it, in part, after this fashion: Much of the music of the program ft ren dered was as slow and dreary as the Ar kansas river down at Wichita. It moved like a music box nearly run down. The love songs, instead of getting brikly to a conclusion as lovers are apt to do, dragged dolefully on like calley slaves scourged w to their lesptetive dungeon. The war songs, instead of conveying the ideas of force, fury and impetuoMtv. ambled deliberately, as a farmer goes to market. The similes are original enough, but the idea of comparing the Nile of Amer ica and its Venice-like city, where the pocay of the commingling notes of the lute, the harp, the zither with the mel low voices of the gondoliers in their moonlight serenades, to the dreary drawlings of a traveling concert orches tra is a. sudden descent from the sublime to the ridiculous.

The duke parts with about i:,000 acres and pockets about $300,000.

ONLY PAPER ON EARTH. The following letter explains itself: Four Smith Journal Ofeice, Dec. 16. To the Wichita Eagle. We need the Eagle in our "Ijwsiness'' and are getting tired of borrowing it from the Wichita real estate men here, who think the Eagle is the only paper pub lished on earth. Some of them are trying to have the Bible society send it out as tracts. Very truly yours, Journal Pub. Co. WICAITA FALLS, TEXAS. A private letter to the editor of the Eagle yesterday announces the arrival of the Rock Island engineer corps at Wichita Falls. Texas. Wichita Falls is situated in northern Texas near the In dian Territory line and about one hundred miles west of Gainsville. A line drawn from Wichita through Fort Reno, Indian Territory, would strike Wichita Falls. This line will exactly suit Wichita, tapping and draining as it will a portion of the Indian Territory touched by no other line. NO ORDERSFOR COFFINS. An Atchison man who read the account of the failure at Wichita yesterday said he was glad this city had based its calcula tion&'on a solid, .substantial growth rather than a bogus boom with no foundation, which proved so disastrous during the p-ist year to many otherwise fairly prosperous interior towns. Champion. A Wichita man who read the above account remarks that he is glad that the liars are principally confined to the Kansas town which has never produced anything but politicians, and mighty poor ones at that; that the only failure in Wichita in six months or more was an undertaking firm too much good health and no orders for coffins, and of course a consignment followed. If there is a bogus boom bung-hole in Kansas it is Atchison, it is Atchison. WEANED WICHITA. Wichita's umbilical has been severed, and she must now not only do her own breathing and depend upon her own heart-beats for a circulation, but must rustle generally on her own hook. Mother Kansas may indulge in a kind of maternal pride over the lusty damsel to whom she has given birth, but her sympathies seem all drawn out for the puny little squealers scattered about over her fair breast. These will neither die nor live, only squeal for more teat and kick at their bouncing sister who has shaken her long hair loose to the eouthwest breezes and developed a mus cle of leg and arm of John Sullivan pro portions. Every influence controlled by the children of our Sunflower mother, political, corporate, and com mercial, if not legislative and executive, will be combined against the compulsion-weaned child named the Peerless Princess, who must now hunt other dugs and fountains or starve. For help mees she will look to her dusky foster sieter in the south, and to the star-eyed goddess of the gulf, and to the man of the land of no name and the other fel low with a handle of a pan to his. In the meantime, she has some mighty promising younger brothers scattered along the southern fringe of her mother's skirts to whom she is tied, and who will help make it lively for the old grunters, whose misfortune it is not to have been weaned at the proper age. The telegraph poles for the 'Frisco are all in place between Burton and Wichita. The Patterson and Burton offices will be opened for business in a very short time. Graphic.

As to the sugar interests, there is no nossibilitv of the manufacturing of sorgnuin sugar neing ueveiopeu so as io compete with the West India sugar ad ! mitted free of duty, and never can be so j long as human slavery exists in the West I India islands. The experiments in man j ufacluring sorghum sugar have all been predicated upon the protective idea, and J at a matter of fact it is not cheap sugar ' we want in Kansas so much .as Ave want Kansas sugar, with the multiplied and I ever increasing activities that are always found among a people who have every thing to sell and nothing to buy. The bounty paid by the state on sorghum sugar was not intended for protection. The state was induced to aid the sor ghum sugar industry to a limited extent because it was in an" experimental state, and when it passes from that state the bounty now paid will be repealed.

The following table, showing the school bonded indebtedness of the state, has been issued by the auditor of state. It tends to substantiate and make good the claim and showing that while Sedg wick county is the richest and most populous county in Kansas her taxes are the least. Twelve counties in Kansas have a greater school bonded indebted ness, some of them three times as great, while the value of Sedgwick county school houses stands third in the list, which shows that Sedgwick county paid for most of her school houses when she built them.

To the Editor of the Easlc: Much has been said and written from almost every standpoint about the ad vantages of Wichita, pro and con. When the city first began to forge ahead of its sisters immediately near her, an argument was used by the advocates of those thrifty places that, while Wichita was in reality a good town of a very good county, she did not enjoy one single ad vantage over Newton, Hutchinson, Kingman. Wellington, WinfieJd or El Dorado, which a few yeais of the inevita ble development of the smaller of these towns might not equal. So far as the material and tangible side of the subject is concerned, this sophistical argument had such an appearance of truth that thousands of people who were attracted to Wichita during the past years, have upon a superficial investigation, invested and settled in these towns". In this way, this citv through its various influences, has contributed more to develop its sup posed rivals than they ever could, have done individual!-. They were the beneficiaries of the attracted and repelled elements of a much larger body in fact, and thus, with due respect to them, they assume in the natural order the iosition of satellites instead of equals and rivals. The fore going facts we have all witnessed within the past few years. Yet Wichita has continued to "grow till she is ahead in population of the largest of the above named towns at least 25,000 soul--. Of the metvphysical side of this question we can bnly point to results. " by did each one of the tens of thousands of in dividuals contribute his share to the general result of building up Wichita either settling in it or a sister town? That is the unanswerable question. Each of the more intelligent portion of nnr Twmlfi will point with pride to ! illS UlUlVKlUai actions and to the - . . liroriMi nf trarif Or Pl'OlPSSIOn through i "","" , - . . .. . ,v ' which he has acted as a prune "not the principal iacior m uw grauu muik. is the egoism that asserts itself i in an active communities, it is not only par donable but leeitimate. But such claims to individual power arc only true in a verv local sense. Generally the- are losr siVht of m tho ajrsreeation of results ms nn individual brick is in the wall of I a lame structure. Philosophers for ages have'had the idea of the inevitable in their minds when contemplating a grand aggregation of natural results. "It is tlTe unexpected which happens" was not j oriTna! with Tallvrand, and the "stone ; tluit was rpiw.ted IS become the key to j the arch" was many times exemplified j before the gentle Nazarine declared it in i Judea. The foregoing argument, though brief. ; raav serve with the intelligent reader to illustrate the often proved facts of his- j torv that no legitimate cuy can ue uiuu by "any human power on an illegitimate site that will stand longt-r titan the life of its special creator lasts.

See how Jerusalem survived every vicissitude, whilst Babylon. Nineveh and Memphis perished without a struggle. The former was hated and destroyed by tyrants time after time; the latter were the creatures purely of tyrants. Jeru salem survived princinallv because of the very destructive acts employed against ner uy cities aiiu. uuuuiuca vjig dead. She is and ever lias been legiti mately a provincial commercial and re ligious capital, and is still regarded as such to the changed methods of a Scientific civilization which can only picture the lifeless ruins of her rivals as the creatures of despots, with no power to live longer than their special builders lived, monuments of men and not cities, in a general and social sense. A true city must come into existence as the result of a combination of varied circumstances, covering a certain field of action, which employs the energies of man in some social aim. The broader and more varied that field may be in all its attributes, the grander and more varied will be the characteristics of the city. Such city must not be built amidst the mines, the forests or the more fertile fields of its territory. If it is. its char acter is special and local. But it must be. and despite the special aims of men, will be built at some eligible point of as- semblacre and distribution of all the social and commercial factors, and their products. A city so founded has a lease of life co-extensive with that of all human society within the area of the territory which created it. This is borne out by "historical and statistical facts, and is not a mere assertion or fancy. AVe will not stop to enumerate the ad vantages of Wichita's internal develop ment and consequent unrivaled superiority in her legitimate field of action, but to proceed to consider her location with regard to the resources of that field as to supporting cities. She is within a few hours ride by rail of a dozen rapidly developing places of that kind in every direction. She does now. and will ever present to the people of thos,e cities a metropolitan char acter that will control then extra local wants in every way. in spite of any local prejudices. Within all this field of supporting cities she is in the center of an unrivaled food supply that can furnish the means of living at the minimum cost enjoyed by any people of a large city. In this" area, aside from, brick, stone, salt and gypsum, the nat ural resources are purely agricultural so far as known. But just bej-ond this area our present railways traverse vast coal field in nearly every direction; and from thence pass on through rich mineral-producing countries into virgin for ests of lumber of many useful varieties. And yet. in all this rich and but partially developed territory, we have not passed out of a rich pastural, horticul tural and agricultural country. It is in Wichita that will be assembled the rich products of Texas, Arkansas and Kansas withthoso of New Mexico, Colorado and Nebraska. Here they will undergo their commercial and mechanical factorage and be distributed to a vast population according to their wants. The developement of Wichita thus far is the result it would seem of the pioneer period in peopling the virgin prairie and eonstructingthe principle I extended lines of rivalry immediately I near her. That result has capitalized and is organizing her population for the varied metroplitan purj)Oses prece dent to the next legitimate step. What that next step will be will best lie seen when under the control of this city, either a few thousand miles of railway will be built over our smooth prairie country to connect it with its special commercial interests or every general western system will center here and legitimate competition give us special rates. With special rates for this city by the railways will begin the era of metropolitan developements. And the special rate must soon come as a legiti mate demand which the roads will not be able to deny. It matters not who erects our great buildings, or who owns our realty or what their fate shall be. It matters not j tQ t'he genera pUrpose wi or poor and shall be ther ho is now rich poor ana snail oe tnen poor or ncn, famous or obscure, these great concerns will remain and they with the land they stand on constitute the inanimate city, the animate city will come and go with perpetual succession. But her destiny is fixed beyond peradventure as a legiti mate citv. V. E. Hutchison. With a magnificent soil. rich, deep, in exhaustible, beneath which is found coal, oil. salt, lead, zinc and natural gas, and above which bend the blandest and most kindly skies, Kansas challenges the world to produce her equal.
