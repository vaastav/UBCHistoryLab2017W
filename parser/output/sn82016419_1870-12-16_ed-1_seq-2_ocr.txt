We desire a large addition to our subscrip tion list, and we make this liberal offer that all may be Induced to take it. MR. KELLOMS REPORT. We owe an apology for not having, drawn the attention of our readers to this excellent paper in our editorial col umns at the time it was published. But a multitude of other duties intervened to prevent us from giving it that atten tion its importance demands. At this late hour we shall attempt to give mere lv an outline, or rather a summary, of this well written report : The present year's attendance, 213, compared with that of previous years makes a very flattering exhibit, being nearly 23 per cent larger than in 

ISO'J, and nearly AS per cent larger than in 18C3. Had there beeu moro room for the accommodation of students, it would have been still larger than it has been And Mr. Kellogg well says that the greatest need of tho school at present. Is additional room. In fact it has siiujily come to this: Thero must bo more loom providud or the school must be content with its present growth and use fulness. In what manner this addition al room can be best and most wisely obtained the Principal very forcibly and we think, rijrlitly, points out. He recommends that a new building cost ing from 00,000 to !? 100,000, be erected and let this be for the Normul School proper ; and then let the present build ing be devoted entirely to the use of the Model School department. This plan is a better one than that of enlarging the present building, for a variety of reas ons: 1st. The present building is complete in itself and not well adapted to receiv ing additions. 2nd. Additions that would be large enough to meet the needs of the school for more than two or three years cannot be erected without destroying the sym metry of tho edifice. 3d. The increused educational benefits that would accrue from the erection of a large, commodious and permanent Normal School building justify an ex penditure of a largo sum for this pur pose, rather than a smaller sum for the purpose of enlarging the present build ing. 4th. Tho Model School department needs and should have this entire build ing, and it is so constructed aud arrang ed that it would admirably servo the purposes of the Model School. The Principal makes. another sugges tion, the wisdom of which we can com mend with equal ardor and pleasure, vli: That the course of study bo so modified, that on the one hand it shall be extended to a four years' course, giv ing to those students who desire to be come thorough teachers, sufficient time to thoroughly prepare themselves for teaching iu tho higher departments of our public schools, aud on tho other hand be contracted to a two years' course, for the benefit of those students whose means are limited and whose de sire it is to prepare themselves merely for the work of the Common School. Confessing to a lack of that intimate acquaintance with the objects sought to be attained by Normal Schools, which would make our criticism of some ac count, yet we hope we may be par doned for sayiug, that in our humble opinion, tho quantity of certain kinds of the mental food with which this course of study, admirable in most re spects, proposes to feed the mind of the student, might bo increased without di minishing, in any mauner, the practical benefits to public school teachers. For example, we do not seo how the student can in ouc short term acquire that thor ough knowledge of Algebra which will fit him to teach this branch successfully, lie can surely hope iu this short time to becomo familiar with no more than the elements of Algebra, and while he might be able, as a teacher, to solve for Ms pupils any niplo problem of the 1st, 2nd or 3d degree, he is likely to have at least one ambitious student, who hav ing bad a taste of this delightful food, might feel unsatisfied until ho had eaten everything of the kind within his reach ; and so coming with his teacher to the Problem of Lights, tho Binomial Theorem, Sturm s Ihcorcm, or some such knotty problem as any one of these, ho would be likely to find some thing he could not digest, and which his teacher would, just as likely, be utterly unable to digest for him. The same thing may be said of Geometry and of the Languages. We are conscious, however, that the "best and most satis factory results cannot be reached in the short time of three years, and so we hope that the suggestion to leugtheu the cur riculum may be speedily adopted. THE 

PRESIDENT XSD THE CRITIC'S. That the feeling among Republicans towards the Administration is measur ably better since the President's Mcs aage has been before the people, than prior to that time, is unquestionable, The position which the President took with reference to the Civil Service Re form, has opened the eyes of even the severest critics of the Administration to the fact, that at heart the President is in sympathy with that measure, and .that this reform is more likely to be ob tained in, than out of the Republican party. In this direction there is but one tep needed to secure almost entire har mony in that great army that placed General Grant at the head of affairs. If Congress will only pass a law by the unanimous vote of the Republican Members, that shall eradicate the evils which this reform is intended to de stroy, the President will readily give it his sanction, and the party will ratify it by their unanimous verdict. What the President says with regard to revenue reform should alio satisfy extremists whether their hobby be Free Trade, or an Unrestricted Tariff. Whatever poli cy iu our commercial intercourse with other countries will tend iu the greatest measure to make the country prosper ous and secure the greatest good to the greatest number, is the policy which the Administration will most heartily en dorse; bnt so many and divers ideas are embraced in this thing that is de nominated by all of its devotees "Rev enue Reform" that it can neither he supported uor rejected. And then, as the President says, a trne revenue re form cannot be effected instantaneously, but must be the work of National legis lation and of time. The President favors the removal of the revenue from art! cles of universal use just so soon as the necessities of the Country will permit it. But at present some protection to home industry is necessary to the encourage ment and growth of home manufac tures. So on this queslson there is real ly no good ground for dissenting from the view of the President. The free traders aud the protectionists, or the revenne reformers should not expect to have all -their views embodied in the policy of the party. As to essentials all these may, and nearly all will agree, Since the President's Message has been read by the people, thero has uot been nearly as much fault-finding with the course of the Administration. The Country sees that the President is hon estly and faithfully endeavoriug to dis charge the functions of his high office, aud despite the bitter enmity of roes in and out' of the Republican party, the ship of State has never been more skill' fully or ably managed. What the Coun try needs most, and wishes most, viz Peace at home and abroad; such man age me nt of the finances of the Country as shall most rapidly reduce the Nation al debt and at the same time make as light as possible the burdens of taxa tion : and, as a security of this and of the general honesty and economy of the Administration, a weakening of the sys tem of the patronage which now holds and abuses the civil service ; the Presi dent has constantly had at heart. In these respects no previous Administra tion has done so well, and in our opin ion the responsibility of preserving un ity aud harmony in the Republican par ty now rests chiefly with Congress and not with the President. THE 

POPE'S SEW fHAMPIOX. Of the many wonderful phases spring ing out of tho European imbroglio, the most surprising is Premier Gladstone's announcement that the English Govern ment has 'resolved to insure the Pope full protection in his person, and secu lar and spiritual rights.' Or iu plainer terms, England Is to succeed France as tho especial champion and protector of tho Popo and Papal power. We venture to say that this astound ing diplomacy was not looked for by even the most careful observers of Eu ropean affairs. Doubtless the English Cabinet never entertained the idea until very recently. Panic-stricken at the prospect of war with Russia, it must have felt that without some new and potent ally Iiiglanu cannot success fully cope with cither Russian diploma cy or artillery. For England always depends upon continental assistance But now, 1 ranee is powerless to even protect herself. Spain has just chosen its King from the nation that has driven the papal forces from Rome. Austria is weak physically, and bankrupt financial ly. Turkey is sick as ever. Prussia is virtually allied with Russia, while none of the minor powers could affect the re' suit. So thrown upon its own resources, the English Government turns with op en arms to the traditional enemy of Eng lish progress, and hopes by one des perate stroke of cowardly policy to se cure for England all the influence of the Catholic Priesthood throughout the world. What a prize to bid for! No wonder the London press is said to "howl" over this official announcement of England's degradation. To trans form the British Lion into a Papal hound, is enough to make it howl for a century. V hat a figure for England to cut in history. What a task for a Prot cstant people to assume. What an epi taph on the departed greatness anfl glory of the British nation. The Pope is forlorn enough to gladly accept any champion, even If it be Protestant power ho and his servile big ots detest. But what return can he make ? What has he done for France iu the present war? Defeat for France meant the expulsion of the Pope from Rome. The Napoleonic aud Papal dyn asties were bound together. But what has Papal authority and Catholic influ ence availed to aid their chief protector ? And what more can the Pope and his Priesthood do for England than for France ? !ro having promised to bestow very much upon a personage who can return very little, it now remains for tho Eng lish Government to carry out its Quix otic enterprise, or else become disgraced in Catholic, as it is in Protestant eyes. How will it restore aud maintain the Pope ? Will it send a fleet up the Tiber to shell the Italians out of Rome, and knock down St. Peter's church in try ing to make Pius the IXth its sole pro prietor? Or, finding how egregiously it has over-estimated the value of its new sought ally, will it tamely back down from its incongruous position, and ac knowledge that England can neither maintain tho Pope iu Rome, or keep Russia out of the Black Sea? It seems to us that this will be the end of Glad stone's surprising diplomacy, and be side such a humiliating situation for England, fallen France will appear hon orablc and powerful indeed.

Public rejoicings in Berlin, to celebrate the recent brilliant victories, are exceedingly popular, and extend to all points or the .Kingdom lu consequence of the heavy losses sustained by the Germans, the people of JJerlin and of the principal towns throughout Germany are active in a movement to personally urge the irn mediate bombardment of Paris and thus prevent any furthur unnecessary waste of human life. An address to the King has been signed by the most influential inhabitants of the city, which will em body the news given above aud which will be presented by influential deputa tious to the iviug in a lew days. London, Dec. 7. It is claimed that the Prussian government has decided to restore Napoleon as Emperor of Erance. His health has wonderfully improved. All loreign accounts represent Uam betta as the coming man for the French. Advices bv mail and private letters declare the French people as resolute in their opposition as ever, and still de termined against any peace which de mauds the uismemberment of the coun try. Gladstone's note announcing that the English govennment has taken measures to protect the .rope, support his per sonal ireedom, spirtual dignity, etc., ex cites great surprise and criticism. It is issued to conciliate the catholic powers, and the Irish people. The .London pa, pers denounce this policy, and say it re verses the traditional policy of England since the iteiorniation. Bordeaux, Dec. 10. Advices from Tours announce the arrival there of over a thousand prisoners. Minister Gambetta In a telegraphic circular to prefects of the department from Head quarters or ueneral Chaucv. savs Chaucy continues to resist the attacks of Prince r rederick Charles, has taken many prisoners and inflicted heavy los ses on the enemy.

The Prussians have entirely withdrawn from this section of the country. It is said there are JO,000 troops drilling at ltordeaux. 1 he newspaper correspondence of this city says, the proposed bombardment of fans has again been postponed because such a course at present would be detri mental to military operations. Ihe real object of the war and the interests of the army at this juncture, are the para mount considerations. The French Government has prohibi ted the navigation of the Seine.
