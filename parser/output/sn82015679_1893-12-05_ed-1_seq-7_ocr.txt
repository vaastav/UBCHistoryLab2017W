Speculation Weak ami a Number of De clines Followed At Indianapolis Gram Was Steady. At New York yesterday money on call was easy at Hi Hi per cent., the last P-an being at 11 2, closing at Prime mercantile paper, V2 p$r cent. Sterling exchange firm, with actual busi ness In bankers bills at It.SGUfiLS-Vfc for demand and $1.8374? LSI for sixty days; posted rates, HSlli 

LSTU; commercial bills, 1.82124.83-;. Silver certificates, OTic bid. liar silver closed at C3Uc per ounce; at London, 31 15-1&1. Total sales of stocks on New York Ex change were 211.30 shares. There was noth ing left ye.-; morning of tlie firmness with whlcu . stock market closed on Saturday, u.i .lie contrary, the specula tion was weak and. sympathized with the heaviness of the London market for Amer ican securities. The publication of the President's message in London in advance of Its delivery to Congress gave the street a knowledge of its contents through the medium of the cable, and the fact it made no mention of a contemplated bond issue was regarded as a bear point anl helped to depreciate values. The November state ment of the St. Paul road coming in with a large decrease in earnings was another factor in the general depression. London, too, was in the market as a seller of St. Paul, Atchison, Union Taclflc and Louis ville & Nashville, and the West sent ia a unmber of selling orders which added to the volume of stock offered by the bears, who renewed their operations at the open ing of the exchange. General Electric gave way the most, being heavily fo11 for the Boston account on the plea that the current price Is above the Intrinsic merit of the stock. Sugar, while most prominent in the transactions, was held within narrower fluctuations than on any day of late. The general market opened a fraction lower, and In the early dealing a decline was recorded, ranging from li to 2 per cent., the latter In Western Union, which was sold to realize the profits of the advance. Before 11 o'clock the pressure to sell was removed and an improvement was recorded, ranging from U to 2 per cent., the latter in Louisville & New Albany preferred. Distilling and Iowa Cen tral preferred being also prominent there in. Subsequently a free selling movement was developed which spread to almost the entlr list, and a. downward movement was inaugurated, which was not checked until a decline of HfrlU per cent, had been recorded. A quick turn was made before nonn en the bull side of the market, Chi cago Gas selling up 1;, Mobile & Ohio, 2. and the rest of the list hH?i per cent. After midday the speculation cain became heavy, and during the afternoon the deal ings were very irregular, and rallies and reactions followed in quick succession. In the late dealings the market became steadier, and at the close was fairly firm. Compared with the closing sales of Satur day, the last quotations were decidedly ir regular. There was considerable activity in the bond market, but there wa3 an absence of that firmness which characterized the deal ings during last week. The tendency dur ing the greater part of the day was to ward lower figures, but toward the close a slightly stronger tone prevailed, and some issuis recorded an advance. Government bonds were stronger and higher. State bond3 were firm. The following table, prepared by James K. Kerry. Koom lti. Hoard of Trade, shows tha range of quotations: Open- High- Low- Clos anie.

LOCAL CHAIN AXD PHOnUCIl. Trade Opeitt Fairly Active with Firm Prices In Moit Llnew. The wholesale ' streets, yesterday, pre sented an active appearance with thei nil. Ing of mall orders and those the traveling eaiesrsen brought in Saturday. A number or buyers -were also In the city. In prices there were but few changes. In some lines of dry goods an advance will be noted. The sharp decline In hog products is fol lowed by a weak tone on increased receipts of hogs and more activity at the packing ta heavy groceries and, as the holidays ap proach, fancy groceries are meeting with litt or o i ! a T-kt1rr ml I . i t ry ofrt I at quotations. HeL-oipts of eggs are light and prices firm. Wool dealers are shipping a portion of their holJing: on the im proved Eastern market. The hide market Is weak on account of the recent heivy failures in the Kast of hide dealers, but It was decided to make no change in prices In this market. The local grain market presents no new features. Heceipts are larger than lart month, but by no moans as heavy as looked for.

The Institute held at Watertown, and the excellent lecture delivered on spraying, set the farmers wild "for a day" on the sub ject, and a great many renolved to give it a trial, but so far as I Know but three pumps were brought Into this township. Two of them were .used and laid suslde; the third one I bought myself and used three times In my orchard. I also used it in the potato field. In spraying my orchard I used the dilute Bordeaux mixture. I seleceted 330 Rome beauty trees, and about the time the foliage began to show the pump was loaded on a light two-horse wagon and the first spray ing done. We drove slowly between the rows and sprayed one side at a time with out stopping. We found that one barrel would spray forty trees, and the 330 tree3 were gone over In one day. On one-half of the trees the bloom failed to appear; on the other half it was so light we expected no fruit. When the bloom fell we sprayed again adding one-quarter pound of Paris green to each barrel of mixture. In ten days from the second spraying we sprayed the third and last time. As the season advanced we could see the .apples begin to snow, and at picking time we were surprised to find we had sixty bushels of as fine Home beauties as we had ever seen, which sold for $1 per bushel, besides all we wanted for winter. Our groceryman told my girl he would take anything of her that 'looked like an appl She went back to the orchard and gathered the culls and sold $22 worth more. This may look like a small showing, but it paid for the pump and material and gave us not less than $10 a day for our work. The work was all clone by inyseif and children My girl drove while my boy and myself handled the pump and hose. It "done me proud" to drive up to the grocery with my load of fine apples and have the farmers ask how it came that I had apples this year. Pensions for Veterans.

BULLS SNOWED UNDER Early Advance Slumped Off on Keport of Increased Visible. Wheat Fluctuated, bat Corn Was Steady and Closed with Little Cliaiiffe Provisions Very Quiet. CHICAGO, Dec. 4. The visible supply re port was disastrous to the bull interests to day. After opening higher and ' advancing fic, wheat took a downward shoot and landed with May only He higher and De cember c better than Saturday's closing prices. Corn was steady and closed without noteworthy change. Provisions were .firm and very quiet.. The bullish sentiment which prevailed at the close of Saturday's trading was still manifest at to-day's opening, and wheat began the day higher. The commission houses were well supplied with buying or ders, and Liverpool markets were quoted steady. London and French country mar kets were also reported firm, and receipts at Minneapolis and Duluth were but 745 cars, compared with 1,201 cars the preceding Mon day and 1.SS2 cars on the corresponding day last year. Under these favorable conditions prices were advanced and the bears retired for a time, while the bulls made unkind remarks regarding a well-known fur-bearing animal said to be afillcted with a sore head. The general Impression among trad ers was that to-day's visible supply report would show a decrease of at least 500,000 bushels, and this was a decided bull influ ence, further aiding the advance. Prices held steady until the anxiously-awaited re port was received, and then the bears had their Inning. The visible showed an in crease of SOS.OuO bushels, and immediately took a fall out of prices. The decline for a few minutes was rapid, but was arrested for a time by reports of remarkably light Indian shipments. Closing cables were ir regular, Paris quoting a decline, and prices went down to the close. May opened at 60?;c, advanced VsC, then lost Ue, gained c, lost jsc, dropped lie, sold off He, and rallied YsC to close at 63c. Offerings and demand were light in the corn pit, and little business was transacted. May opened unchanged at 40c, advanced c on better Liverpool quotations and the bulge In wheat, lost ic with the weakness In wheat, and rallied Uc, to close where it had opened. Continued dullness was the only feature in the oats market. May opened unchanged at 31-c, advanced Ho in sympathy with corn and closed at the opening figures. Provisions were dull, the opening being at a slight advance on lighter hog receipts than the estimates. Buying by the Anglo American Packing Company and Sam Wolf sent prices up a trifle, but with lack of demand most of the gain was lost. As com pared with Saturday night January pork is 2'2C higher, January lard .10c higher, and January rib3 .02$c. Lake business is over for the season. The last charter was 3rc to load and hold wheat in Buffalo. Rail rates were easy at 20c per 100 pounds for flour and grain to New YoYk.

The Persistent RucIIlus. Berlin Letter. After a long investigation, the death of two wealthy ladles, recently, of typhoid fever jwas traced to the fact that they had eaten oysters at a first-class wlnehouse on the Frledrich strasse called the Rebstack. and kept by a wine-grower named Wil hlm1. a brother of the famous violinist. It has been decided that the oysters be came contaminated by placing ice taken from the river Spree upon the oysters in order to cool them, and the ice introduced into them typhoid fever bacilli. Professor Koch, it may be added, gave warning Ions ago that freezing does not destroy the vitality o the bacillus. ; '-I, Cleveland Can't Stand It. New York Commercial Advertiser. The President who appointed Van Alen in consideration of $50,000 cash could hardly be expected to withstand the temptation to turn a penny, or at least strengthen himself politically, in operating the Indian service, conveniently removed from popular gaze. The Indian Rights Association complains that of fifty-seven Indian agents removed pclltics figured in forty-four cases and the service suffered. Mr. Cleveland's asplra tiens are lofty, but he has the weakness of the Maine man who confided to his pas tor that there was not one thing he could not withstand and that was temptation.
