The numerous pianos designated as "stencils" are pianos which cannot be traced to the factory in which they were made. Such pianos have no standing, and no firm, can be held responsible for them. The Estey Company takes pride in the fact that it does not carry in stock an in strument of such a "caste." Every instru ment it handles is of known origin, either an Estey or some other reputable make. Call or write for catalog.

The Usual Clubbing Rates with leading papers and magazines are In forco for Phoenix subscribers It seems like the Irony of fnto that the man who Invented and exploited tho Aladdin's lamp oven with whloh ho taught people how to cook proicrly should die from Indigestion. The calamity howlers, whoso voices swelled in high chorus last July, whon the government receipts showed a deficit of (23,000,000, nro naturally disappointed In the estimate of President Shnw that there will be a deficit of only (8,000,000 at the end of the current fiscal year. Secretary Bonaparte of tho navy de partment tnkes rank as tho high chief Iconoclnst when he projmsos that the old warship Constitution bo used as a tnrget for gun practice by tho up-to-dato ships of the navy. The protests which have poured In from every direction will precludo any such action. Mr. Bonaparte seems' to be entirely devoid of sentiment. The President's recommendation that the Congress carefully consider whether the burenu of corporations cannot con stitutionally be extended to cover Inter state transactions In Insurance, will bo sure to provoke a sharp controversy In Congress and a wide discussion outside Congress. The recommendation Is . not new, being merely n reaffirmation of what the President said In n message to the 58th Congress, but recent events have given the subject a new Importance and an added emphasis. Evidently cities and town containing presidential post offices are not to be rent with Internecine strife over the nest nppolntment except In rnrc cases. Post master General Cortelyou lias announced thnt merit has preference jvcr political Influence. It Is said that the President is not only In accord with this ruling, but that he Is tho author of the continuous service policy. Tho understanding In Washington Is that the oillco of every presi dential postmuKter will receive a rating after being reported upon by a post office Inspector, and If tho rating Is high tho administration will take the responsibility to reappoint the present Incumbents, un less the Congressman of the district can show good and sufficient reasons ngalnst a reappointment. Tho Immigration problem is brought to mind again by the annual report of Frank P. Sargent, which shows In a year 1,020,199 aliens landed on our shores with tho ex pectation of making homes here. Tho number was an Increase of 213,629 over tho preceding year. Mr. Sargent predicts that tho chief source of futuro Increases In Immigration are Russia mid Austria Hungary. -Air. Sargent says that the problems of Immigration "loom so largely In U10 prospect of our country that It may bo said without giving Just cause to charge exaggeration, that all other ques tions of public economy, relating to things rather than to. human beings, shrink Into comparative Inslgnlflcanco." Tho annual report of Postmaster Gen eral Cortelyou contnlns some striking sentences. Here Is one; "I am less con cerned about the deficit than I am about efficiency of administration." Hero Is another: "For tho time being, attention can be moro profitably devoted to an im provement of the service already estab lished than to an immedinto consideration of such questions as the reduction of rates of postage, a parcels post, postage savings depositories, a postn) telegraph and tele phono nnd kindred subjects." The deficit for the year ended June 30, 1905, was $14, 572.584.13, ngalnst $8,779,492.30 in 1904. Mr, Cortelyou estimates' the deficit for the year ending next June nt $14,441,116. But for tho rapid extension of tho rural free delivery service the post oillco department would now bo self-sustaining. The oxtcnt of the land frauds througout tho western states has- been revealed to some extent through the special articles from time to tlmo In the Boston Tran script, but it is surprising to learn from the annual report of Secrotary Hitchcock of the interior department that his agents are n&W at work to punish frauds In 20 states and that In tho cases already brought to the attention of the courts thcro have been 30 convictions and 532 Indictments. Some of tho most Important prosecutions have been in California and Oregon, and In the latter etato the late United States Senator Mitchell and Con gressman Herrman wer convicted. Mr. Hitchcock has found that In two countlej in Kansas 22 persons were holding 122,000 acres of land illegally. In Nebraska frauds have been very extensive, and two men who are alleged to have maintained in unlawful Irtclosure a quarter of a million acres escaped with a fine of $300 each. The Lewlston frauds involve 10, 000 acres of the best tlmberlaod In Idaho, Many frauds are reported'from the south em states, but the holdings of the opera tors there ore not so large as in the West It its understood that the dragnet is now close to United States senators from a western state and other officials who have not figured in the scandals publicly up to the present time. See "Old Bl StebblnB" tomorrow after noon ana evening. Senator E. W. Cnrmack, who has been described ns having "a caustic tongue, nn endless vocabulary nnd leather lungs'" Is going the length nnd breadth of Ten nessee shouting praises of Theodore Roosevelt. He was formerly chief critic of tho President In tho Senate, but the now light which has come to him la said to bo due to the fact that he has found that Roosevelt Is extremely popular with the people of Tennessee, and Carmnck In his fight to retain his scat has adopted tln method of fulsome praise. His op ponent Is "Bob" Taylor, ex-governor, famous as the "fiddling statesman." The personnel of the new British minis try-was announced Sunday, with Sir Henry Cnmpbell-Banncrmnn as premier. ' Sir Robert Thrcshle Rcld, lord high chancel lor, Herbert Henry Asqulth chancellor of the exchecquer, Herbert John Glad stone secretnry of homo affairs und Sir Edward Grey secretary of foreign affairs. Sir Henry Campbell-Baniierman has held many Important public positions since 1871 und has been leader of tho Liberal party since 1899. Mr. Gladstone Is the fourth son of tho great statesman and received his political training as secretary to his father. He Is an advanced Liberal, favoring homo rule, free trade nnd tho abolition of the veto power. John Morlcy, the widely known author, holds tho posi tion of secretary of state for India under the new regime, .nnd John Burns, tho labor leader, Is given the post of presi dent of tho local government. Tho Boston Journal went beyond any other newspaper of flambouyant Journal- Ism In handling tho Mary Rogers case, when In Its cartoon "Blot," it depicted the hand of Gov. Bell pouring a bottle of Ink over the stnte of Vermont. Gov. Bell had absolutely no connection with the conviction or tho legal procedure of the case other than to grant tho first reprieve when the claim of new cvldcnco was advanced and the second to avoid any clash with the federal courts. Ho was urged to Interfere with tho operation of tho machinery of the law, nnd this he re fused to do, notwithstanding that his own views nro said to be against capital punishment. Ho was placed In a very trying position, but ho took tho only con sistent course open to him. It was not his place, after the courts and legislature had said that Mary Rogers should dlo to stop the execution. Criticism of Attorney General Fltts also rests upon no founda tion. He simply performed the disagree able duties which were Incumbent upon him through his official position. Through nil of the course of the case Vermont has had a governor nnd nn attorney general who have carried themselves with poise, dignity and good sense. Death of Edward Atkinson. Edward Atkinson, 78; the widely known political economist, dropped dead Monday from 1111 attack of acute Indigestion while about to enter his ofllce In Boston. After attending private schools In Boston ho received a business training In commis sion houses In that city. From 184S to is, 1 lie was connected with several large manufacturing companjes ns clerk and treasurer. He then became president of the Boston Manufacturers' Mutual Fire Insurance company, nn office which ho held to the tlmo of his death. In 18S7 he was nppolntcd by President Cleveland special commissioner to report upon tho status of bimetallism In Europe. He. was one of the most prominent mono metalllsts of New England. Ho wns ono of the founders of the New England Emi grant Aid society, nnd a founder nnd director of tho Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Atkinson s devotion to old-fashion ed Ideas of honesty and economy In the life of the people did great good, and ho was nn Incessant preacher of economy. The Aladdin oven, which ho Invented nnd exploited, wns calculated to accomplish moro good than It has achieved. This dqvlce ior eooKingi or, ns tie put it, "teaching peoplo to slew," utilized the heat from a common lamp for making soups and cooKing all kinds of food for tho table. Ho demonstrated that a man could thus provide for his family at the cost of a fow cents a day, and he was fond of giv ing exhibitions of his apparatus and tho delicacies It was capable of turning out. Tho'thought which Mr. Atkinson develop ed came to him when going over a build ing on n cold day, when the workmen wcro opening their dinner palls. Cold victuals and pie did not seem to him good fuel for the human furnace, and ho set about devising something better. Mr. At kinson practiced what he preached. Ho wore the clothes that he recommended tho man of slender means to buy, nnd ho nto the food which he told others to eat, after having cooked it himself, as he had ad vised others to cook It. Y. M.
