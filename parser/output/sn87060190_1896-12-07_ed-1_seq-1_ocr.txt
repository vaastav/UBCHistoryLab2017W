FORECAST OF THE PROCEEDINGS. Tho Senate Wlil Walt Until the House Takes Some Action on tho Appropria tion Itllls, the Only Measure Which Will Likely l'ass -Tho Calendars Pre sent a Wldo Itnuge of Material. Washington, Dec. 7. Tho first day's session of tho Fifty-fourth congress will bo devoted almost entirely to receiving tho president's message, provided it is scut in today, as is gonerally conceded it will be. Immediately after tho open ing prayer committees will bo appointed to notify tho president and tho houso of representatives that tho sonato is or ganized and ready to receive communi cation and proceed with business. The sonato will then in all probability tako a recess until it becomes known whether thb president will send his message in today or not. If the precedents aro fol lowed there will bo an adjournment soon after tho receipt of tho message. Tho first week of tho senate is not ex pected to bo productive of important re sults in a legislative way. Thero aro many senators who think that but little or nothing should be dono beyond tho passage of tho appropriation bills at this session and as these measures necessar ily originate in tho house, thero will bo a disposition to postpono tho season of activity until somo of theso bills can be received from tho other end of tho cap itol. The probabilities aro that tho daily sessions at tho beginning will bo comparatively brief, and that tho scnato will content itself with four days work each week. Tho calendar presents a wide rango of material for consideration in case tho senate shows a disposition to busy itself. In this is included tho immigration bill, which is the unfinished business, the Pacific railroad funding bill, the state hood bills and tho Diugley tariff and bond bills, as well as the Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Senators Lotlgo and Chandler havo announced their determination to press the immigration bill to a vote as speed ily as they can. It will bo tho first reg ular business to bo taken up and can not bo displaced except by vote or unani mous consent. Thoy hopo to get the bill through beforo tho holidays. It is also possible that tho president's mes- sago may suggest subjects for speeches, and there aro those who predict that tho Cuban question will receive vigorous attention from tho beginning of tho session. It is generally agreed that tho Repub licans will hold a caucus to determino upon a lino of policy, especially with referouco to tho tariff, and until after tho exchange of views which this con ference will pormit, no step is likely to bo taken which will commit tho party to any position on any question of po litical significance. The opening week promises to see tho houso put its shoulder to tho wheel of tho regular appropriation bills. Chair man Cannon and tho committeo on ap propriations woro at work all last week and it is their earnest intention to pass two and possibly threo of tho bills bo foro Christmas holidays. Tho pension and legislative appropriation bills aro about ready and work on ono or tho other of theso will bo begun in tho houso beforo the wcok closes. Tho pen sion bill, although it carries a larger amount of mouoy than any of tho other supply bills, is very brief and unless somo political discussion is precipitated is not- likely to consumo much timo in its consideration. Boyoud theso two bills nothing is in sight at prcsont. It is, of course, not unlikoly that tho comraittoo on rules will provide something for tho houso to do in caso tho committee on appropria tions is not prepared to go ahead with cither of tho appropriation bills. Tho courso of tho legislation so far as tho important inoasures on tho calonder is concerned (liko tho Pacific railroad funding bill, tho Nicaragua canal bill, etc.), will bo determined entirely by tho rules committee. But it is safe to as sume that nothing will bo allowed to block the appropriation bills as thoy are roported for action. Thoy always have tho right of way at the short session. 

EXTRA SESSION IS SURE. Thoe l'osted Suy Major MoKlnloy Will Call It In March. Washington, Deb. 7. Thero is prac tically no longer any doubt of tho inten tion of Presidont-oloct McKiuloy to con vene tho Fifty-fifth congress in extra ordinary session early next spring. Thero woro sovoral arrivals of friends aud confidants of Major MoKinley di rect from Canton, who bring the very positive announcement that a call for a special session to bo convened a fow days after tho 4th of March has been decided upon. It is stated by men in a position to know that this decision has been defi nitely reached by Mr. MoKinloy since his consultation with Mr. Dingloy, chairman of tho committeo on ways and means, and that Mr. Dingloy has been entrusted with tho privilogo of making known this intention at tho proper timo. Senator Thurston, ono of tho latest arrivals from Canton, expressed in tho most positive terms the conYicMou that an extra sossiou will bo callod. Tho senator was one of tho earliest and stanohest supporters of Mr. MoKinloy, and tyore is every reason to boliovo that his utterance is inspired , to a degree, though tho senator himself declines to saytuatjiaohTalhecajio. A1I T can say," ho said, "is that I havo veiy recently seen Major MoKin loy, and that I am convinced a session of tho next congress will bo called for about tho 15th of March. That ought to bo satisfactory. I can not quote nny one, but I do not consider that thero is any doubt on tho point." GIGANTIC DEAL. Telephone and Dleetrle Lighting Itnslnecs of St. Louis In He Itevoltttloul7ed. St. Louis, Dec. 7. A gigantic deal, involving a revolution in tho tolephono and electric lighting business of St. Louis has been consummated. Threo big companies, with an aggregate paid up stock of nearly $3,000,000, has been organized by about 20 of tho mest prom inent and wealthy citizens of St. Louis. Ono of tho company's will introduce a new telephone system in St. Louis, at much lower service rates than those prevailing at present. It will establish a homo telephone plant which will in timo extend to neighboring points. Tho second company, owned by tho same persons, will operate an immenso electric plant, supplying power of all kinds for public and private use. Tho third company will construct tho telephone and electric plants for tho two other companies, manufacture tho equipments, and will construct a com plete system of underground conduits. A fourth company is also in tho deal, but it will not figure in tho proceeding at present. Tho deal is ono of the largest over ac complished in St. Louis and its effects aro far reaching. Tho combination was made for the avowed purpose of revolu tionizing tho telephono and general electric business in St. Louis. Tho local capitalists start out with tho announce ment that tho new telephono company will provido telephones at 30 per year lor residences, o0 tor physicians and $00 for business houses. Tho present tolephono rate is 100 per year for tho Bell Telephone services. Tho now company will open general offices next week and will at onco get out and hustlo after prospective sub scribers. Tho local capitalists apparent ly mean business as thoy filed their ap plications for conduit space with tho board of public improvements lato Sat urday afternoon and also filed four bonds aggregating $140,000 with tho mayor and council.

BRICE MOVE. The Cincinnati, Hamilton and Da ton Itallroad to Uo Paralleled. Lima, O., Dec. 7. Articles of incorpo ration for tho Dayton Northern Railroad company, with general offices to bo lo cated here, was filed Saturday. Tho capital stock is $10,000, and tho incorpo rators aro James B. Towusend, W. B. Richie, O. N. Haskell, Edward R. Thomas, W. O. Brown and J. E. Me grue. Tho same power which built tho Lima Northern is behind tho now inovo and it seems that if tho Ohio Southern gets into other hands, tho Lima Northern will bo built to Cincinnati and tho Lako Erio and Western will uso tho road to Franklin, join tho Northern Ohio and Lima Northern, Mackinaw and will en ter Cincinnati together. Tho lino is a Brice move and when executed the paralleling of tho power ful Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton will bo effected. HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS. Tho Movomrnt of Annexation Will Uo rushed With the Next Administration. Washington, Dec. 7. Interest in tho affairs of the Hawaiian republic has been rekindled by tho dinner which was given Saturday night by ex-Secretary of State John W. Foster to Mr. Hanna. Tho guests, who numbered a dozen, in cluded tho Hawaiian minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Cooper, who is in tho city, Minister Hatch and Secretary Hastings of tho Hawaiiau legation, and half a dozen mombcrs of tho senatb committeo on foreign relations, among thorn Sena tors Morgan, Halo and Lodge, who aro advocates of annexation. It is believed that tho movement for annexation is to bo brought forward again with tho advent of tho noxt ad ministration, and it is likely to bo ono of tho leading questions with which President MoKinley and tho Fifty-fifth congress will havo to deal.

PRESENT POLICY OUTLINED. A General I'lnn Tor Securing liquify, Uni formity and Justleo in (he Determina tion of Appeals How tho Pension I'tind Has Hern l'iotectod- Kefomineiidatlniis to Congress l'or Futuro Legislation. Washington, Dec. 7. The report of Assistant Secretary of tho Interior Reynolds for tho present year shows tho policy pursued in tho administration of pension affairs. It states the important changes in tho rulings and practice and the following out of a general plan for securing equity, uniformitv and justice in tho determination of appeals. Tho assistant secretary says : "Tho liberal and generous spirit which prompted tho enactment of the pension laws lias been tho guide of the depart ment in their construction. Former ad judications havo not been disturbed save whero fraud, error in law, or mistake was apparent." Figures aro cited to show tho mag nificant reduction of pending cases and to demonstrate that for the first timo iu eight years tho work of tho office during tho past year was devoted to consider ing current appeals. Tho action of tho commissioner of pensions was reversed in 2,0G6 of tho cases ruled. The report says : "General satisfaction has followed tho recommendation of last year for such legislation as would secure better protection to tho pension fund due in competents and others, followed by tho law directing all quarterly payments to bo mado by check. "Gratifying results havo followed tho passago of tho act of March 2, 1805, which secured an extension of cases wherein payments of accrued pension could bo made, as well as that of the act of March (5, 189(5, relating to tho com mencement of pension under act of June 27, 1800. "Tho suggestion is again mado as to tho advisability of such legislation as will lodgo in tho federal courts tho right of any ono on behalf of tho gov ernment to ask hotter protection to tho pension fund of those laboring under legal disabilities. Tho following also are suggested : "That justico demands tho universal application of tho common law rule in proof of marriage. State laws govern and lead to denial of titlo in cases which aro equally meritorous. "That tho pensionable rights of minor children who olaim under tho act of Juno 27, 18G0, should bo defined with moro certainty where tho soldier dies leaving on widow surviving. "Tho act of Aug. 5, 1892, relates to pensionable titlo of those women who served as nurses during tho war of tho rebellion. Titlo is confined to those who served in regimental post, camp or general hospitals. Tho refusal of tho war department to recognize those as properly employed who served in tho first three classes mentioned tends to defeat their titlo and renders this por tion of tho act nugatory. Attention is invited to this in order that proper legis lation may bo enacted to relievo any de serving claimants of an unjust and un intentional discrimination. "On tho 1st of February, 1890, a new division was organized in tho ofllco of the secretary by his order ami tho board of pension appeals was thereby merged in this new division, which was desig nated tho division of pension a 'fairs. By this means all matters relating to ponsions were brought into ono division and under tho assistant secretary's su pervision. Tho result has been to har monizo and systcmatire this work and has also led to its gn ater expedition in tho hands of u compeunt force." BIG
