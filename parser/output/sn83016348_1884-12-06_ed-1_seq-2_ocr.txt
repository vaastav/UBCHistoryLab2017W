One man was elected who ran upon the St. John ticket. He ran lor the position of justice of sessions in New York, and gets the office because it turns out that his opponent, who re ceived all the votes but 19, is ineligi ble. As the one solitary man in the union who pulled through upon the St. John ticket, Mr. Eugene B. Halle has achieved a degree of fame. The President says the civil service law has fully answered the expectation of its friends in securing competent and faithful public servants and in pro tecting the appointing officers of the government from the pressure of per sonal importunity. l ire next adminis tration and the public generally will doubtless be glad if as much can he truthfully said a year hence. Gov. Hamilton's decision makes the Illinois legislature a tie. The Sen ate stands, Republicans 26, Democrats 24, Independent 1, and the House Re publicans 76, Democrats 76, Inde pendent i. The two Independents — Senator Streeter and Representative Haines—will hold the balance ot power. Haines has declared that he will vote for the Democratic nominee, but Senator Streeter is credited with a leaning toward the Republicans. He was instrumental in bringing about the election of David Davis eight years ago. Gov. Hamilton, of Illinois, has by a righteous decision awarded a certificate to Mr. Leman, and thereby defeated the villainous Democratic plot to steal a United States senator. Fur his ac tion in the case he should receive the thanks of every citizen who believes in giving expression to the true will of the voter. A great crime was attempted aiming at the very foundations of Re publican government. It has happily been thwarted, and the indications point strongly to the ultimate discover}' and punishment of the men who at tempted the infamous perversion of the will of the people. The vigorous investigation being carried on at Chic ago has resulted so far in showing clearly enough that the forged Repub lican tickets found in the ballot box bearing Brand’s name were printed on the 21 st of November, and probably put in the box that evening in place of two hundred genuine Republican tick ets bearing Leman’s name, which hail been voted at the election of Nov. 4, and the chances appear to be that some Democratic politicians of stand ing in Chicago circles, will be proved to have been implicated in the fraud. THE 

PENNSYLVANIA BKIG ANDS, It seems almost incredible that in as thickly populated state as Pennsylvania, a regularly organized band of lawless thieves, conducting their operations systematically and in open defiance of the local authorities, could it seems not only exist, but actually flourish. This band it seems has had its regular field of operations for years past, and that with the full knowledge of the officers of the law. The Philadelphia dailies of Sunday last contained long accounts of the capture of Joe Buzzard, one of the gang who had made a midnight raid upon the village of Brownsville. If the “Buzzard” gang are allowed to defy the authorities and make their raids upon the peaceful farmers of that state, Pennsylvania will not deserve the reputation she has enjoyed in the past, for the prompt enforcement of law and order. THE SHOUT SESSION. Congress began its short session on Monday last, and for the next three months will excite public attention. As usual its term will lie principally given up to the consideration and passage of the appropriation bills, but other mat ters of great importance to the country at large will claim at least a portion of its attention. The pressing necessity for providing for the defence of our coasts and re building our navy will challenge renew ed consideration, and there does not seem to be any very good reason why this session should not reap the credit of having liberally provided for these great national purposes. The Repub lican members are a unit in favor of erecting modern fortifications, con structing modern high-power artillery, and putting our navy into condition to hold its own in defending our mari time cities against the powerful iron clads of the other naval powers. Now that the Democrats know that men of their own faith will have control of ex penditures for these purposes it seems that they can very well afford to aban don their former unpatriotic stand, and join the Republicans in providing ap propriations that will lead to beginning at once the tedious work of building ste*;l-clad forts and steel clad ships of war. The Blair educational bill, 100, is j awaiting action by the House. The touching affection for the colored man | and brother that pervades the Demo- i cratic heart since the election is no! doubt fully shared in by the 1 temocratic members. Other matters of great im port there are, also, that will try the wisdom of our Solons, and in the out set of the session it is well to hope that each will be handled with sagacity, and a broad regard for the welfare of the people. Till: PKESIIEXT’S MESSAGE President Arthur, in fulfillment of the duty imposed upon him at the opening of Congress, addressed to that body, , on Monday last, a message which, like his previous messages, is a statesman like and able document. i He begins it with an allusion to the orderly, temperate and law-respecting ' conduct of the people during the ex ' citing days following the late election, and in that connection urges Congress to provide more precise and definite regulations for counting the electoral vote. He is undoubtedly right when he says, “1 am persuaded that, by the people at large, any of the measures of relief proposed would be preferred to continued inaction.' But unless Con gress can approach tins subject with more patriotism and less partisanship than in the past the condition ot inac i tion is likely to continue. Our relations with foreign powers are ■ set forth at great length. The acquisi tion of the great Chinese trading fleet by American citizens leads to the sug gestion that it would be well to provide ■ a uniform ride lor the registration and documentation at ships built or pur ; chased abroad by our citizens and em ployed exclusively in traffic between foreign ports. The restoration ot the * agency and consulate general at Cairo ! is recommended upon good grounds. Negotiations will be opened with Ger many for a treaty of extradition, whose i operations will be uniform through all the states of the empire. The import . ant treaties negotiated with Spain and 1 Nicaragua are appropriately referred to i and Congress is notified that nothing is lacking to make our treaty with Mexico effective but the tariff legislation made ; necessary by its terras. The President . suggests that our neutrality laws need 5 overhauling and amendment so as to cover all patent acts of hostility com milled in our territory and aimed against a friendly power. Revision of our naturalization laws is ■ urged so as to do away with certain obsolete provisions and cure numerous defects pointed out. The suggestion of a central bureau “wheiein should be filed authenticated transcrips of every record of naturalization in the several federal and state courts, and to make provisions also for the vacation or can cellation of such record in cases where fraud had been practiced upon the ■ court by the applicant, or where he had i renounced or forfeited his acquired ! citizenship,” is an idea that should be enacted into law. The records of such a bureau would often prove of inesti mable value to our naturalized citizens. Mr. Arthur concurs with the Secre tary of the Treasury in advising the im mediate suspension of the coinage of silver dollars, and renews his former recommendation for the abolition of all internal-revenue taxes except those on distilled spirits. Touching the import ant question of national defense, he is emphatic in the expression of his opin ion that the fortification of our coasts should be commenced at once upon a comprehensive scale, and that the work of placing our navy upon a war footing should be accelerated. His recom mendations touching these great objects of national concern will receive the cordial approval of the country. In concise terms the President rec ommends that a suitable pension be conferred upon Gen. Grant. He no doubt had in view the misfortunes that have overtaken this most illustrious citizen in his declining years as well as the eminent services to which he refer red, and it is reasonably certain that Congress could not do a more popular act than to promptly carry out the rec ommendation. From the opening to the concluding paragraph the message is clear, straight forward, manly, statesmanlike. The President has apparently aimed to do just what the constitution prescribes— “give to Congress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedi ent.” This he has done gracefully and ■ very thoroughly. THE 

CHICAGO FRAUD. Of the outrageous fraud committed in Chicago, by certain i) inocrats, the re ■suit of which had it been successful would have been to cheat General John A. Logan from re-election to the United States Senate, tire Pliiladephia Time* says: Mr. Grand, in whose interest a bold fraud was perpetrated in Chicago to re turn him falsely as elected to the State Senate, now confesses the fraud and lias withdrawn from the contest. Mr, llrand’s withdrawal from the con test for a seat to which he was not elect ed is all right as far as it goes; but if he respects himself and the Democratic party whose candidate he was, he will proceed at once to expose anil punish the men who committed the fraud in his name and interest. It is now manifest that a deliberate and flagrant- fraud was attempted in Chi cago to count out a itepnhiiean Senator and count in a Democratic Senator. The hand lias failed in its purpose, hut the fraud is none the less in magnitude be cause it has been defeated, and its au thors ate none the less criminal. It is now Mr Brand's opportunity to vindicate himself and the Democracy of Chicago by sending the Chicago Demo cratic billot thieves to the penitentiary. That's the way to teach the country that Deuocracy is really in favor of honest government. Look Sharp.

The second session of the Forty-eighth j Congress opened at Washington on Mon | day last, with a quorum present in both ; Houses. In the Senate. Messrs Sherman ! and Garland were appointed the com mittee to wait upon the President and inform him of the readiness of the Senate to receive any communication lie might make. The credentials were presented of William P. Sheffield, appointed by the Governor of Rhode Island to fill the vacancy caused by Senator Anthony’s death. Hills were introduced by Mr. Dawes to consider citizenship on Indians, and by Mr. Cullom to piohihit color distinctions in the army. On motion of Mr. Ingalls, the committee on Public Lands was instructed “to report such legislation as may be necessary to author ize the Secretary of the Interior to summarily remove all fences illegally constructed on the public domain of the United States. The President’s message was received and read. When the read ing was finished, Mr. Aldrich formally announced the death of Senator Anthony, and the Senate, as a mark of respect, ad journed. in the House, 222 members answered to roll call. Messrs. R onfall of Penna., Cox of New Voik. and Hiowne of Indi ana, were appointed this committee to wait up n the President. The credent ials of 1> T.

Mr. Hutchins, of New York, from the Committee on Appropriations, re ported a bill making temporary provision for the naval service. It was referred to j the Committee of ilie Whole, Mr. Hut- I chins giving notice that he would call it up to day.

SIAU.NI) DAY. In the United State Senate on Tuesday I W. P. Sheffield, the new Senator from 1 Rhode Island, was swo.u in.

The Senate then began the consideration of bills on the calendar, but without any action. In the House, the credentials of 11. G. Smith, elected from the Seventh District 1 of lowa to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Kasson’s resignation, weie presented and Mr. Smith was sworn in.

Roth Louses adjourned un til Monday. STEALING A SENATOR. A Grand Jury Getting the Inside Facts of the l.allot-itox Frauds in Chicago. The Federal Grand Jury has succeeded in getting at the inside facts of the bold attempt on the part of the Democrats to steal a stale senator in order that the legislature of Illinois might be Demo cratic on a joint ballot and a Democratic United States senator be elected. In the investigation of the a’leged frauds in the Second precinct of the Eighteenth ward of Chicago, Sixth Senatorial dis trict, S. H. Chace, secretary of the Ilan scou & Co., printing establishment, was called as a witness, and furnished the last link in the chain of fraud. He testi fied that about noon on Friday, Novem ; her 21, Joseph C. Mack in, secretary of the Dciiiocntic State Central Committee called on him at his office, showed him a Republican ticket, and asked him if he could duplicate it. He told him he could do so, w hereupon the head of the ticket was cut oft and sent by Jeremiah Thomp son, a trusted employed, to the estab lishment of Raker & Co., to be engraved. Mackin said he wanted the ticket repro duce <l, wit h the name of Rudolph Brand, Democratic candidate for State senator, in place of that of H. W. Leman, the Republican candidate. In the evening about 2 ttttl) of the tickets vveio printed, aid Mr. Wiightsaid ho delivered them personally to Mackin in his room at the Rainier House. On Monday last, when he heard his man Thompson had testified before the grand jury that he thought Mackin ordered Hie tickets, he went in seaichofhim and found him at “the store,” a saloon kept by “Mike” Mc- Donald, Mayor Harrison’s boss gambler. The two took a walk, and Mackin told him he wished that he and his brother would keep out of the way of sub pumas from the grand jury, as if they did the matter would soon blow over. These counterfeit tickets were found in the bal lot box, and must have been put there after I) r. m. on Friday, November 21, 17 days alter the election, i The grand Jury also heard the tosti inony of Wm. H. Wright, the printer who set up the bogus ticket. His testi mony was merely confirmatory. Indictments were found against the judges and clerks of the precinct some day s ago, but they have not been return ed. Since affairs have taken the new THE CECIL WHIG, ELKTON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 0, 1884 and startling course they have, Mackin * t \\ ill doubtless be indicted. i 1 The citizens committee held an ad- 1 jourued meeting on Wednesday after- 1 noon, and measures were taken and a j committee appointed to raise funds for the prosecution of the authors of the frauds. The general opinion seems to be that it will be dillicult to obtain evi dence of a character to secure their con viction under the state laws. WASHINGTON LETTER. From Our Regular (’ orrespondent. Washington, Dec. 1, LSS4. The newspaper prophet in Washington, after he fashions a cabinet for the Presi dent-elect to his own intense satis action, is fully prepared for more arduous labor, and is now busy in planning the work of Congress with great zest. It seems to have struck him that possibly Mr. Cleve land may have a voice in the selecting of his Cabinet. Members who have arrived in the city express the opinion that Congress will not tind time this session to attempt any very important legislation. Besides the appropriation bills, the land grant for feiture question will probably be taken up, and it promises to bring about along and bitter light. Some of the members, however, have not given up the idea of tackling the tariff, and say that some thing should be done this session. Mr. Morrison, it is understood, is primed for another fight. He looks upon the suc cess of the Democratic party as an in dorsement of tariff reform, and has ex pressed the opinion thatsomething should be done this winter to reduce the rev enue. If congress is disposed, however, to make a busy and eventful session of it, there is no lack of material in the shape of pending legislation. There is, for instance, the silver coinage question, which urgently calls for attention. A very respectable element is calling for a bankruptcy law; there is a groat desiie in legal and business circles for action which shall expedite the woik of the Supreme Court; much remains to be set tled respecting the relations of railroads ami land corporations to the government; and there are various private canal and railroad schemes to which Congress will be asked to give a helping hand; the pension laws are not yet satisfactory to some influential classes; and the friends of the shipping interests look upon last winter’s legislation as merely prelimi nary, and are anxious to follow it up by broader measures; the education bill presents its claims to the House; and two or three territories which have now a large and ambitious population are clamoring for the rights and dignities of states. It will be seen readily, therefore, that even if Congress prefers to ignore the tariff and follow precedents pretty closely in the appropriations, there is an abundance of important subjects on which it can profitably spend the winter. Among the first questions presented at the Capitol today will b* a resolution in the House calling for a diplomatic inves tigation of the action of the French in prosecuting work on the Panama canal, and declaring in favor of the American policy of predominance on this continent. Several leading Democrats have the mat ter in charge, and it is indeed gratifying to see some inclination towards enforce ment of the Monroe doctrine. The rep resentatives of the three great Isthmian inter oceanic transit projects are gathered here in anticipation of some action by Congress on this important question. The Panama people are simply anxious to he let alone. The Nicaraguan people 1 want substantial recognition. The Te hauntepic people are willing to take any thing they can get. James B. Eads, the father of the Tehauntepic scheme, went to London last summer to get some money. 1 don't understand that he got any there. But he has apparently got ten some on the way home, for he is ex hibiting quietly to New York capitalists a working model of his inter-oceanic ship railway which cost him SIO,OOO and oc cupies twenty feet of space. He is now arranging to exhibit at New Orleans. GENERAL NEWS NOTES. Governor Hamilton, of Illinois on Tues day decided the Leman Brand contest. After an elaborate review of the evidence and citation of authorities, he awarded the certificate of election to Leman, Re publican candidate for State Senator in the Six lb District. The Committee on Organization of the Independent Irish-Americans met in New York on Tuesday last and decided to continue the Assembly District organiza tion under the name of the Irish-American Protective l uiou. They also adopted an address to their fellow-countrymen, “urging them to organize Irish-American Protective Leagues everywhere in the United States to resist English fiee trade.' ’ The posse in pursuit of the Buzzard gang of thieves on the Welsh Mountain abandoned the search on Monday night. It is believed that “Abe” Buzzard has lied from that neighborhood, *s for the first lime in several n > robberies were reported I lie re yesterday m >rni ig. At Youngstown, Ohio, on Tuesday morning, the Jury in the case of engineer John Fitzsimmons against the Pennsyl vania Railroad, for $"i0,000 damages for injuries which crippled him for life, re turned a veidict for Fitzsimmons for $27,0(J0. At the time of the accident the Company offered him SIB,OOO for his claim. He refused, and last summer brought suit and secured a verdict for $20,000. The Company asked and was granted a new trial, with the above re , suit. The Electors for President and Vice- President met Wednesday at the capitals of their respective States, and cast their ballots, in accordance with the law. At Annapolis the first step of the electors was to bunt up the law appropriating sooo to defray the expenses of the body. It was found. Gen. Bradley T. Johnson ex-Confederate Brigadier was chosen chairman of the body. It is unnecessary , to remark that the vote was cast lor Cleveland and Hendricks The President o?i Wednesday sent to the Senate the n iniiuations of officials appointed during the recess. Among them are Hugh McCulloch, of Maryland for Secretary of the Treasury; Frank Hatton, Postmaster-General: James Har lan, presiding Judge of the Court of Ala bama Claims; aid Walter Q.

MOTHER’S DREAD. The Wonderful Histrionic l)ve!o])iticcil of h Famous Child Act re**. Ohio I (jo World. The New York public was surprised a few years ago at the arrest, at the instiga tion of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, of little Corinne, the child actress. The little girl, loss than eight years old, was taken from her par ents and kept in confinement until released by order of the Court and Mayor of the city. Mrs. Jennie Kimball, the mother uf Co niine, who has been known to the public for many years as vocalist and comedienne, has devoted the greatest care to the training and education of Corinne, and the result is a development of natural faculties really phenomenal. “When did you discover Coniine’s re markable talent?” was isked of Mrs. Kim ball. “I can hardly remember the time when her eyes would not sparkle at the sound of music; she began to sing before she could talk. Before she was four years old she created a sensation and received the prize of a gold chain and locket studded with diamonds, at the National Oaby show io Boston. Next she sang in a concert given i hy Brown's Brigade Bind, and in 187 b | made her debut as Little Buttercup in the i Juvenile Pinafore Company. Since then 1 she has sung in opera and played various: solos nearly everywhere.” Mrs. Kimball is a lady of tine presence, | and when playing at the Itoston Museum, was herself known as '‘Little Jennie Kim ball.” • “What has become of the little lady?” asked the reporter. “She has given place to the person you . see before you. Like so many others I have , grown somewhat fleshy. Indeed I assumed , such proportions that I began to fear for j my health. Why, at times I would have the most suffocating sensation in my heart; then again my head would he attacked ml | I have frequently fallen to the floor in a ■ ( dead faintingfit. I consulted several emi- , nent physicians and they toM me I must', abandon the stage, if I expected or hoped J to live. This seemed terrible, for I am de voted to my profession and also to the de velopment of Coniine.” “And yet you appear perfectly strong?” ' “And so I am. Why, I have reduced 1 my weight over twenty pounds within three months and I never felt better in my life. If any who are troubled as I was questions this, let them try Warner’s sate cure, the remedy 1 used, and they will, I am sure, be speedily convinced of its truth. I believe it is the finest medicine in the world, and any number of my friends to whom I have recommended it, have found it as beneficial as it has been to me.” “IsCorinne’s health good?” Perfect. The child has so much life and vivacity she is overflowing with it, oa and | off the stage.” The only previous instance of such re markable precocity which history chroin- 1 cles is that of the famous Peg Wellington, who first appeared in “The Beggar’s ()pera,” when but a little older than Corinne. cs Column THE MUSIC QUESTION. North East, Mil, Dec. 2d, 18-S4. Mr. Editor: —The article that appeared in the columns of the Ctdl Democrat of Nov. 29, in reference to the music ten dered by the North East band on the occasion of the Democratic parade, is such a glaring misrepresentation of tlie truth that we deem it necessary to beg space enough in your journal to state what is true. Mr. John Dunbar was the only player outside of our own members on the even ing referred to. If the pieces rendered by our band give more satisfaction to tlie musical ears ol the public because they “weie familiar airs,” we cannot see w.iy men who can render “more difficult music” should rush into print and ell a falsehood in order to steal a compliment which the people collided upon us, because they believed we deserved it. Respectfully yours, Isaac W. Cos Lett, Leader. Elkton Ceme'ery— What a Visitor Saw. I walked through the Elkton cemetery a few days ago, and was forcibly struck by the careful manner in which some of the burial lots were kept, and also with the neglect others suffered. In numer ous instances, obscure little graves in out of way places where but seldom the visitor came, were nicely sodded and tastefully dressed with autumn flowers, while within a stones throw there were pretentions slabs of white marble mark ing a grave not only unsodded, but over grown by weeds. The contrast struck me forcibly, and I thought, here is - mir ror of human nature reflecting a true picture. The moral if there bo any the reader may draw, it seems to me there is a very pointed one. One other matter I must mention- These grounds are not sufficiently enclosed, the fencing is a perfect guard against cattle or swine, but it will not keep out that pest of creation, the dog. and consequently it is a play ground for the canine. Not only do they play but I noticed several graves where they had dug and in one or more instances they had made a large opening at the head of the grave. This may perhaps boa difficult thing to put an end to, still I think that a few well directed charges of buckshot, from a good gun would go a long way towards putting a stop to it. The dogs that com mit these depredations are as a rule worthless curs, without which the world would be better. I mention the>e things not in a spirit of fault finding, but trust ing as a lot holder to aid those in charge in keeping the grounds in good order. OIJSKRV UK. IN A HORNETS NEST- A Corroflponeent hxpluiiH matter* am! Expresses Himself a- Well. North East, Dec 4. 1 s>- 4. The few items we sent from this place to The Whig two weeks ago, has Kinder got us into a hornet's nest. We will ad mit we were badly frightened at first, but we soon got over it. Tis a pity the editor of the Star hadn’t brains enough to see, when we sail we thought it might have been a Democrat that broke into the postoflice,(to show his ignorance he resorted to an editorial on the sub ject,)we only mentioned it in the way the Democrats have said “turn the rascal a out.” Dies any body with common sense think that the Democrats mean that every man thats employed by the Government is a rascal. Now to he in ear nest, our minds rests on n oi eas the party who broke into the oil: *. We don't know that it was a Democrat, Republi can, Half-breed or stalwart, or do we care.but we know he was a thief. We arc inclined to think, (as the editor of the Star is so sensative) that lie lias been sitting straddle of the fence so long that ho begins to hurt, and is climbing down on the Democrat side with a lot of talley thinking he can get into their camp, and get a share of their loaves and fishes,and get back again without anybody know ing it, or its probable that he mly h ive run short of editorial subjects. If he has, and his royal highness will allow, we will venture to suggest political economy for his next leader. Tnis is a good sub ject, a large field to work in, and the bars into it are always down. He might bring out some ideas which w.ieu seen by president elect Cleveland might have a good deal to do toward shaping the policy of his administration. Wc will sail along this way for a while if we find its necessary to lay aside our mark will do so. We will venture now to make some reply to Prohibitionist.but we do it with fear and trembling. When the local option law was being agitated for our county, it would have been folly for either of the two great political parties to have shouldered it, the only chance for its success, was to throw politics to one side, which done and the members of the j two parties who favo.ed it, worked to gether harmoniously, and we v. ere sue ; cessful in obtaining the law by about 1700 majority. We strongly favoied this plan all through, believing if w. had ; a good law, and it was rigidly enforced it , would be a great benefit to oi r people \ and our county. Other counties would , see our peace and prosperity umu r it, would fall in line, and by that plan it would be only a matter of lime t< cap ture the state. It then could be nailed by a Constitutional amendment. Other states would see the benefit (un people derived from it, and would work on the same plan, and the work would have progressed. What do we see now? Some of the leaders of the prohibition 1 party thought they had established a party big enough, strong enough to stand alone, notwithstanding the protest , made against it by level head* d men. went to work called a National Con voli tion, and nominated a president and vice president. By this act they have , arrayed both political parties against them. Neither party will truvt them for there may be in the future < flier po- j lilical cranks like St. John and Daniel, who long alter notoriety. These men went forth under the cloak of serving the Lord and saving poor fallen human it.y. Their real object was to defeat the Republican nominees which they did. 1 The prohibition party wronged their I best friend. These two gentlemen can very well settle back on the end of their back bones, well pleased at what they did. If they have not been paid for it. the Democrat party ought to reward them with a foreign mission.

Wo believe that the management of the liquor traffic in a Mate beloi gs to the state and it lias uo business to be brought into national politics unless you can get all the people to think alike, which is impossible our local option law is being violated every day by a class of people, known as hard cases, if they are not, tho business makes them so, and the j only way the law can be enforced is by hard practical work. Who is going to undertake it unless it be the *J.. Pt caching sermons, writing editufids, and temperance essays and temperance lectures to these, men, is like pouring water on a ducks back.

Mu. Edit u:—An elfort is being made : in the English churches and is now mooted in some of the religions bodies of this country, to inaugurate a punch slate 1 of morals and chanty lor the present . ! generation, in hi<jh. as well as low places, j * Caesar should be as pure as Caesar's j wife.” i quote a resolution olferwd in ! one of the societies to accomplish this I object: Resolved, that to maintain the j law of purity it is equally binding upon men as upon women. ‘•Thou” in the ; Decalogue is addressed to the human i family at large, the woman are included * with the men. Nevertheless society lias j been prone to make adiMinction between | sin in the man and sin in the woman, ■ practically pronouncing that which is un pardonable in the one may be passed over or condoned in the other. This distinc tion has found recognition in ft ■'<//• ;> lure* 1 as well as in low. In this way, au impar tial provision of all law, Divine and hu man has been ignored, and t lie act that has been allowed to visit irretrievable i ruin upon a woman, rendering her a ; hopeless outcast, has been called and ; characterized as “gallantry*’ in men. ! Women straying from virtue have been spurned and cm >be cl under foot, while the authors of their shame have been re- j ceived in society tritit.honor, Oiton the i very suspicion of wrong has putwoman ! beyond the pale of hope. Tims while maintaining that woman is the weak r. a demand is unde for a degree of virtue j which supposes a superior stivng; h; ami while it is declared that “Caesar's wife j mint ho above suspicion,” one is ..t• •;i suspected of some persona! motive if he insists upon the same requirement on the part of Caesar, This tone of society is unmistakably low, ami the atmosphere is decidedly malarious. fins distinction in power of the man is one upon which the moms of this society are particulailv severe. It is a distinction that the chiis tian world is called up m to vi-.it with unsparing condemnation; a distinction that all goo and true men should de spise. Caesar's wife should indeed be above suspicion, but a corrupt and fallen Caesar is as guilty as a fallen woman. Sosajs the Churchman. B. 11.
