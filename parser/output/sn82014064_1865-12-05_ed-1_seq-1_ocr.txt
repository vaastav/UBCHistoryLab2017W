Mr. JAMES BROOKS, of New York, made a speech characterizing tbe omission of the members from Tcsneise from the roll as unprecedented, un just and totally uncalled for. “ If,” he said, “ Mr. Maynard was not a loyal man from a Union and loyal State, then the President of the United States was not a loyal man, but an alien and a stranger.” Be charred that the adoption ot tbe resolution, ex cluding tbe Southern members from this House, by the Republican caucus, was desigtxdas astaganlstic to tho President's forthcoming message.

The Thirty-eighth Congress dosed its constitutional existence with tne storm cloud of varsllilovcr ns, and altera nine months' absence Congress resumes its legislative authority in these council balls, rejoiong that from shore to shore in onr land there is peace Its duties are as obnocs a* the sun's pathway in the heavenr. Representing in its two branches the Stales and the pwple, its first andftughest obliga tion is to guarantee to every State a Republican form of government. The rebellion baring over thrown the constitutional State Governments in many States, it is your duty to mature and enact legislation which, with the concurrence of such a basis of enduring justice as win guarantee all necessary safeguards toj the people, win afford what our Magna Charter, the Declaration of Inde pendence, preclaims the chief object of gov eminent, protection to all men In their aliena ble rights. [Applause.! The world should witness In this great work the most inflexible fidd ly, the most earnest devotion to the principles of liberty and humanity, the truest patriotism, and the wisest statesmanship. Men by the hundreds of thousands have died that the Republic might live. The emblem of mourning darkened the White House and the cabin alike, but the fires of aril war have melted every letter in the land, and proved the funeral pyre of slavery. jt is for yon, representatives, to do your work as faithfully and as well as did the fearless saviour* of the Union in their more dangerous arenas of duty. Then we may hope to see the vacant and once abandoned scats around as gradually filling up, until this hall shall contain representatives from ever* State and District, their hearts devoted to the Cnionfor which they are lolegislatc; jealous of its honor, proud of Its glory, watchful of its rights and hostile to its enemies. The stare on our tannere that paled when the States they represen ted arrayed themselves in arms against the nation, trill shine with a more brilliant light of loyalty than ever before* [Applause. 1 , Invoking the guidance ot Him who bolds the des tiny of nations in the hollow of Bis hand, I eater again upon the duties In this trying position with a heart filled with gratitude for the tmasualiy flatter ing tn which it has been bestowed, and cheered by the hope that it betokens ral support and assistance In all its grave responslbiU tii*: lam now ready to take the oath of office pre scribed by law. , _ .

Great dissatisfaction exists among the officers of lower grades, especially those who have served fe the field through the war, in consequence of the tm-- jast manner in which promotions are made. They complain that officers who bare done nothing but set in easy chairs during the last four or five years, for out oi range of the enemy's guns, have received most of the promotions, while their siaim* hare been ignored. The Louisiana delegation here was reinforced to day by the arrival of cx-Gov. Wicklifl'e- of that State. The delegation have given np oil hopes of being admitted, and will return to at an early day. The Superintendent of Indian Affairs, stationed at Atchifou, Kanras. has just communicated to tbe Commissioner some or the details regarding the recent attacks on tbe Overland stage coach and tbe killing of six of tbe passengers.

The Saperlntendeot expresses the belief that the Indians composing this hand were not present at the ratification of the treaty of peace between their tribes and the United States, and that when they return and learn of the literal provisions of the treaty, they wm *ee fit to cultivate friendly re lations with the Government. T. C. Durant, Vice-President and General Man ager of tbe Union Pa rifle road, is here making ar rangement for the examination and acceptance by tbe Government Commissioners of tbe tint forty miles of the main line West ot Omaha. Since the decision of the President, approving tbe amended' location of the line, the work has progressed very rapidly. Gossip about tbe organization of committees mostly assumes that Thad.

He argues at considerable length in favor of his policy of reconstruction; says ottr relations with England and France were never more aatiatic tory, and calls •pedal attention to the recommen dation of Secretary McCulloch to convert tbe 7-30 bonds at any time before their maturity at the Sec retary's option into six per cent bonds, interest payable in cold.

Collectors on tbe Iren tier report that the smug glers who have been so active arc becoming alarm ed at tbe preparation? made to apprehend them, and that the business is falling off. Merchants along the line, both in ihc States and Canada, arc shut ting np their shops and suspending operations. Since tbe revenue officers inaugurated tne system ofcloselyeramining the dotting of females who cross the frontier, that class ot travel is falling off— not rme woman crossea the St. Lawrence now where twenty did before. During tbe month of November, the Second Comptroller of the Treasury revised two thousand seven hundred and seventy- three prize claims and six thousand four hundred claims of heirs ot de ceased soldiers. Tbe Second Comptroller has decided that in case of a soldier detailed as a clerk in tbe War Depart ment, payment of bounty maturing while on such tcrvlcc cannot be made, os extra pay is received lor detached doty of this kind. It Is also decided, un der the same authority, that a soldier who enlisted in the Veteran Reserve Corps coder provisions of General Order No. 191, of June 85th, 1851, Is not entitled to any installment of bounty main ring when serving as clerk in any department, but if discharged with all the men ot his regiment, be cause the Government no longer requires the ser vice of their entire'term of enlistment, be main tains the same footing and rights in regard to claims aa pertain to ihc balance of the members of tbe stmc regiment. Wapdikotok, Dec. 4.—There Is some talk of a change in tne presiding officer of the Senate in place of Senator Foster, of Connecticut. The Southern members have given up the hope of ad mission immediately, if at all. Most of them leave to-morrow lor their homes. The I’realdent's message is lengthy and highly important. The President takes a decided stand In reference to loreicu aflairs, and is almost semi- Itelligcrent in tone. Our claims for indemnity against England are to be sustained and the Euro pean aggressions upon onr continent are firmly protested against. The Secretary of the Treasury recommends a policy of judicious contraction as a means toward the return cl tpcc!c payments. Wascixctom, Dec. 4. —The cose of petition for maiidaanu by James L.

AFRICAN. Its First Production In America. The African was produced for the first time in this country In New York, on Friday even ing last, by Marelzek’s troupe. From a live criticism in the N. Y. Times, wo take the fol lowing Interesting musical description of It; There Is a so-called overture, but it b of slight proportions. A phrase which is re peated constantly through the open to Indi cate Inez is hero heard lor the first time, and speedily leads to the melody which forms the finale to the second act. These motivi are played In several keys and on several lustra . ments, according to the composers’ custom. The first act opens with a scena and ro man za for Inez —very chaste and pretty. All the music allotted to thu character Is ex quisitely wrought, but U sometimes lacks inspiration. A vigorous riiomd’e leads to the Council scene, and is followed by a chorus in unison, which In power, fluency and melodi ousness has seldom, if ever. been surpassed. It will bear comparison with nothing save the Benediction chorus of the “ Huguenots,” and even the nwlU not suffer by the Juxtaposi tion. The entry oi Vasco to urge the scheme before the council is followed by some of the best dramatic music ever written. His state ments are large. eloquent and manly. The superb declamatory style of Signor Mazzoleni —we need scarcely add—contributed materi ally to their effect. Sclika and Nclusko, her companion and compatriot, here come upon the scene, and give rise to many fine phrases. A little duet, where Vasco Implores Sclika to speak, is bcautithl and pro voklogly short. The navigator’s appeal to the council being In vain, no relieves bis mind by abusing that dull and pompous body m a square aod popular melo dy which forms the finale to the act. For this luxury of vexation he is thrown In prison, where we find him in the next act. He is sleeping, and the faithful Sellka watches over him. Under such circumstances it Is natural that she should sing a slumber song, and equally natural that it should be somewhat commonplace. Nclusko (baritone) has a fine aria; the quick movement being remarkably original and vigorous. Signor Bellini song this and the other music ofnls role with rare fire. The map business, where Sclika points out the way round the cape, Is heavy; re lieved, however, by beautiful passages such as the duo—a very melodious and tender fiiece. The finale retains to the ornate but omiliar theme already heard In the overture. In the third act wc have the scene-painter’s piece de resistance—the great ship, with its cabins, flush deck, mast, sails, rigging, Ac. The effect of the “set” is extremely good, and repays the inevitable delay caused by it. One Is surprised, however, to notice that in those early days the wheel was used for steer ing purposes, and that telescopes were Quito common. History docs not record that cither of these articles were invented in the time of Vasco di Gama, but it is obvious they ought to have been. A very singular and striking mariner's.chorus opens the act. One of its peculiarities is a total absence of lorm, and' another Is the appalling fact that the tenors have to sing up to Cin alt. The effect is ex tremely good, but not in the slightest de gree nautical. A prayer for all the voices, richly harmonized and boldly massed. follows. In this act As lutko gives his wild and extraordinary di rection ior the helmsman to steer for the north—a tew bars of unaccompanied decla mation that possesses a singular potency. The great sensation effect of the scene is achieved when the vessel turns slowly to her helm. Odly instead of veering to the north, she comfortably settles down into a south westerly course, to accommodate the Acade my of Music. Xdusko slogs a Storm King bahala with gusto—a piece of no particular merit. The storm comes in due course, and subsequently a horde of wild Indians, who massacre the crew, and take possession of the dismasted vessel. The curtain descends amid a tumult of unusual virulence, aud decidedly more noisy than anything else. The fourth act opens with the celebrated Indian march, a lengthy composition, serving as an introduction to the various masses of the procession, and as ballet music for the Bayaderes and Amazons. Wc all know how Meyerbeer excelled in this species of compo sition. The present march is full of rhythm etic character and charming effects of instrumentation. If It does not rank with the coronation march of the “ Prophetc,” it Is surely not far behind that famous moreeau. The tenor' aria, O JParadiso, is exquisitely chaste and dreamy. Indeed, the music of this act is so superlatively excellent, that it is useless to ?>cak of U except in general terms of praise, he daet for tenor and soprano has never been surpassed ; notwithstanding the compar ative weakness of the succeeding allegro. A pretty female chorus (with Glockenspiel accom paniment) and dance bring the act to a close. In the fifth act there is a marvelous duct between the two sopranos, In which all the inventive skill of the composer seems to have been poured out. The second morivb is re freshingly Italian in character. We are hnr riednowtotbe upas tree—a botanical pro duction which Is ushered In by an instrumen tal passage of great power. Scllka’s closing scene is exceedingly tender, and the whole act is thoroughly poetical. To return to the instrumental passage Just referred to. It consists of on andante conlabfie of sixteen bora. To the eye, there la barely the indication of a melody, and assur edly no promise of the stupendous effect which in reality is produced. The passage is strictly in unison—that Is to say, no octaves are employed, and embraces a succession of eleven notes only. These arc oestowed equal ly among the violoncellos, the violas, the vio lins, the bassoons and the clarionets. An earnestness and intensity of sound is in this way obtained which Is without a parallel In music. The effect is perfectly thrilling. The “African” has been placed on the stage in a splendid manner, and is cast to the full strength of Mr. Marclzek’s company. The music salts thfe artists, who lost night were all in excellent voice. Of their efforts and Mr. Bergman’s we shall speak on another occa sion. For the moment It most suffice that the opera was a complete success, and that Mr. Maretzek’s liberality and industry hare con tributed in a large degree to lasare that result. Terrible Death of a Tight Bope Per former. [From the Richmond Whig, Jfov. SO.] Delane, whose real name Is Thomas L. Huntley, was advertised to appear at the Wilmington theatre on Monday evening last, in conjunction with Charley While’s Iron clads, in a tight rope performance. The rope extended from the stage to the centre gallery, forming a eteep ascent that itappearedalmost Impossible to walk. At the appointed time, however, Huntley made his appearance, and with the heavy balance pole, commenced his teat. He walked with great ease and success in the ascent, reaching the gallery amid the rapturous applause of the audience. In a few moments be tuned to descend to the stage bnt after taking a few steps he lost hls foothow and fell, but succeeded in gaining the gallery. Apparently becoming mortified at hls partial failure, he remounted the rope and attempted to descend to the stage backwards: but alter proceeding a few feet from the gallery he again loslhls balance, and then commenced a painful and thrilling struggle for life. Find ing that he would probably fall from theropa, be threw bis balance pole into the dress cir cle. and, it Is supposed, made an effort to spring into it himself. He merely, however, touched It with hls icet, and wespreelpltatcd, bead downwards, into the parquet below, the left aide of the head striking the corner of one of the seats, frightfully crushing the skull, and producing almost instant death. The deceased was a native of Nashville, Tennessee, where he leaves a widowed mother, but has latterly been a resident of Richmond, Virginia. Ho was aged between nineteen and twenty years. This was his second perform* ance in public.) A 

PC6ILISPS FUKEEAX. Disgraceful and Sickening Scenes* The London corrcspohdent of the New York Thness&ya: “ The funeral of Tom Sayers, though by no means equal to some memorable obsequies in New York, was still something of a spectacle. Crowds of the roughest*klnda of roughs gath ered early in the strceUsof Camden Town, the suburb oi his residence. The pnhllc houses were draped in mourning, and drovaa roar ing trade. Convivial parties drank their gin and beer at the open windows, sang songs and shouted chorales. It was the next thing to a banging in front of New gate. While waiting lor the hearse the crowd in the street was entertained by bands of negro minstrels. The chief mourner was a brown dog, his collar trimmed with black crape. There were thirty thousand people who preceded or followed the mortal remains to Hfgbgatc —t large portion of them were bullet-headed, big-jawed fighting men, and boys, who do not work, nor as yet vote, for a living, and yet manage to have enough to cat, and more than enough to drink. These, yel ling and swearing, swarmed Into the beautiful Hlghgate Cemetery, playing leap-frog over the tombstones. They climbed the trees, and squatted on monuments, to get a good sight u The grave where tbo'r hero was buried.' 1 The service was read, and then with cat-calls, oaths and jells, they rolled off to the nearest nubile house to drown their serrowa. Sayers diCb consumption, at purely by hard drinking. Of the largo sums of money he ho» received since his fight with Keenan, he leaves *>nt twenty or thirty thou* sand dollars to his children.” The London JktOy iV'c-ir* says a disgraceful scene occurred at inc funeral of Tom Sayers, on the 15th Inst.: • Soon after mid-day a vast crowd had assem bled In High street, Camden Town, where the ex-champion lived, and the main road and pavement from the Mother Redcap, for several hundred yards toward Hampstead, was Infested by what looked like an execution mob. The shops were nearly all closed, partly perhaps out of respect to the memory of Sayers, and partly (there can be no question) out cf deference to the evidently predatory Instincts of the crowd. Jesting, swearing and rough chaff, wishes that the music would coinc, Jostling and horse-play, were the occu pations most in vogue. All the way from High street to the ceme tery, the same class of people, on foot, in carts and on the roof and inside of over-laden cabs, were to bo seen steadily making for the hero’s grave. At the cemetery Itself, the gutos were guarded by what seemed a strong tody of pouC«neo f who only admitted people who either “gave the number of their tomb.” or otherwise Justified thoirclalm to enter. At 2 p. m. this crowd was easily kept la order, but half an boar later a successful rush was made, and some hundred sturdy vagabonds carried the gates by main force, amid the yells ; and shouts of their companions. The police succeeded m reclosing the gates, adq in again exercising discrimination as to whom they should admit. As it was, the tombs ana covered crypts were crowded with people, who turbalcntly jostled and laughed, trampled on the grass, and defiled the graves with os Utile reverence for the place they were In as If It had been on old prize-ring. The succeeding two hours were taken np in watching the hand-to-hand combat between the police outside and the rapidly increasing crowd of roughs, in the arrival and admission of tavern celebrities, each admission being the signal for a struggle on the part of those who wanted to forcejthalr way. and in se curing vantage ground from which to see the procession. Scon after 4 o’clock p. m. r the sound of drnms and trumpets was beard, and the hearse and mourning coaches struggled through the surging disorderly mob. Sayers’ pony and ponycart, with his magnificent dog, the sole occnpant of the latter, followed Im mediately after the hearse. The police con trived to keep back the attendant nmbfora few moments; but as soon as the cofim was taken into the cemetery chapel, and before the carriages had filed in, the crowd of thieves and blackguards proved too strong for those opposed to them, and the gates were again stormed. The members of the band, whQe in the act of playingihe “ Dead March,” were scattered pell-mell, their instruments flying overhead and themselves running for safety. Hundreds of the foulest scum of the back courts and alleys of London, the creatures who only come to light in the aggregate at an execution or a race course, or an Illegal bet ting ground, rushed in to bold saturnalia at the grave slue. For a few* minutes the police were completely overcome. They were a mere handful of men against the enemy, but they subsequently rallied, and once more suc ceeded In closing the cemetery gates. Many of the roughs were trodden down !o the raid, and alter it was over, the gasping, speechless forms, stretched at no unfrequent intervals on the grass, or reared by their luckier comrades against the tombs, while neck-cloths were torn open and animation restored, spoke to the severity of the conflict. THE ROMANCE OF A MEDIUM. The Love Life ofpr. E. R. Kane, and 111 m Letters to and Secret Marriage With Miss Margaret Fox. The latest sensational book Is a volume of love letters Just published by Cnrleton. The author la one of the Rochester Fox mediums, who claims to be the widow of Dr. Kane. This story resembles in various respects that of Abelard, of Walpole, of Swift for his Stella, and of Chevalier wykoff for Miss Gamble. It draws the curtain and lays be fore the eye of the world a peculiar chapter in the life of a distinguished man and a sin gular family history. There Is the nsnal ro mantic perversity of the passion at the very outset of the story. The persons were Dr. E. K. Kane, of the United states navy, whoso. Arctic discoveries have a world wide fame, and Miss Margaret Fox, well known as one of the original Rochester rappers or “mediums” of spiritual communication. One day—to begin at the beginning—the Doctor went to one of the sconces of the rap pers in Philadelphia. “ There” (to use his own words) “he saw a little priestess, conning in the mysteries of her temple, and weak in everylning but the power with which she played her part. A sentiment almost of pity stole over ms worldly heart as he saw through the disguise. Can It he that one so young, so heautiflil, so passionate, and yet so kind hearted, con be destined for such a life? These were his thoughts. Thereupon, he went to work and did all that true kindness could do to get her confidence,” and in doing this he lost ms heart, and fell Irretrievably in love. The Doctor Is sold to bare declared thatTio determined at once to make the young lady his wife. He told her plainly that ‘it was no life tor her” to be there—so constantly In the public gaze. He was thereafter at the seances every day, and every day bis Interest in the sensitive medium grew stronger. His attentions of various kinds were constant,and Ids desire was always that Margaret should relinquish her life as a medium because “she was fitted for better things.” In oil this we see a true and noble nature. Dr. Kane be* came an avowed lover of Margaret, and the constant theme of his letters to her Is “how much 1 wish that yon would quit this life of dreary sameness and suspected deceit.” He was In constant torture through his sensitive, delicate tenderness for her. “It was snch a it was so repulsive, so abhorrent to re* nent to ho exposed to such associations.” Finally the Fox family gave way to the im portunities of the lover, bnt apparently not until he and Margaret were betrothed. Then she was sent to a school of his choosing, and to reside with a family of his relatives. He went on the Arctic voyage, and they were to be married on his return,and make a wedding trip to Italy. How many Arctic days were gilded by the thoughts of that Italian Journey. But all this time Dr. Kane’s attachment for Miss Fox seems to have been a secret to his immediate family. He wrote to her: “There is but one life in this world, that of self-ap provalondyetho was a slave to the ap proval of others. He had felt keenly all that was least refined in her position, bat his love enabled him to bear what he knew others, without that tender reason, would sneer at. Bnt though the engagement was partially a secret, Dr. Kane corresponded with Miss fox constantly while absent through a confideilal friend, and this person regarded her as the Doctor’s affianced wife. The story ofthls cn nagcmcntcrcpt Into the papers and wounded the pride of the Doctor’s relatives. Ho hod not therefore miscalculated its effect upon them when ho judged it beat to keep the en gagement a secret. Dr. Kane was absent from May, 1853, till October 1655. His vessel came up New York bay, and Margaret was in tbe cityat the time. She beard the cannons that greeted his arri val. and In a fever of Impatience she waited for him to come to her. All that day, that evening, all night and the next day she waited and waited in vain. Then be sent word that he wanld come soon. There was “ great trouble In his family ” over this match. He was beset on all sides by remonstrances, and so on. Bis messenger asked also. It Is sold, for tbe letters that had been written by the Doctor. On the third day the Doctor come, and Miss Fox now refused to see him; but re lented upon earnest entreaty, and the lovers met once more. But the marriage was to be “ postponed ’’—they were to meet “as sister and brother.” So much the lover had yielded to the pride ol his family. At this point the story becomes somewhat painful, we see the misery of the two lovers as they ore victimized to the conventional pride of ambitions relatives. The Doctor’s own thoughts appear in this scrap of one of bis letters: “Once upon a time there were certain crystal rare? in fairy land kept bright by the bands of little snlritf. When burnished they shone like ihc stars of heaven. Ton would suppose that each of the f a irv crystals contained some pore and beautiful oh ject. such as young flowers kfseed by dew-drops, or golden fruit just ripened on thebough. Bnttnla nasnci tbecafe. In tno centre of each rased, srtr rounded by mould and rust and mildew, was a Ic&ibsome toad." Thus the lover showed, however brilliant and splendid bis llfo was, he did not fed all ri"bt at heart. Eat despite this broken en gagement, the Doctorcouid not separate him self from his fair one, until the prudence of Miss Fox’s Blends required that she should not be visited by a man whose friends thought her unfit to be his wife. Then came another engagement, made with a ring that had been found in the Arctic regions, and as a sequel to this the Informal marriage of Dr. Kane and Margaret Fez comprised in h£s declaration made purposely before witnesses—“ Maggie Is my wife and 1 am her husband; wherever we are, she is mine and I am hers”—a mar riage that the Doctor himself considered so real and valid that be subsequently wrote to the lady os “ my wife.” These letters are deeply interesting in them selves as the love letters of a distinguished man; but, since they are so evidently private, the question will naturally be asked, why are they now published? The answer Is, to vin dicate the lair name equally of Dr. Kane and of Mrs. Kane; to prove to the world that Mrs. Kane was not an artful intriguer, en trapping a distinguished man, and also that Dr Kano really regarded her as his wife. This has, apparently, been made necessary by the course of Dr. Kane’s family. Following out their former objections to Miss Fox, they have given to Mrs. Kane only a partial recog nition. Dr. Kane left money In trust for the support of his wife, aud otherwise left ample means; bat It Is said, ia the preface to (he letters, that h!s relatives have succeeded lu withholding from his wife even the sum left for her support, and have otherwise brought her character In question. His letters arc now given, therefore, to let all know the real state of the case. The Erie Canal and its Rivals—Prompt Enlargement Demanded. [From (he Buffalo Commercial Advertiser.] In addition to movements in behalf of the enlargement of the Erie Canal, oar readers are familiar with the cflortswhlch have been, and are still being made to open a channel between the Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario, and also to build a canal In the interest of Oswego around the Falls of Niagara. Wo allude to these several movements, at this time, in order to show our citizens the dan gers which threaten their Interests and If possible to aronsefcthem to the necessity of action. The apathy which exists not only among onr own citizens but throughout the State in regard to the enlargement of our canals seems to be wonderful, In view of the vital Interests Involved. Nothing ismdrd certain than that unless speedy action Is taken toward enlarging cur State Canals, the trade of the West will find some other channel. It Is equally certain that if efficient action is bad upon our part to en sure the completion of that great work, that the dangers to which we allude will bo avert ed. The West is not only satisfied with ths present channel of commerce through our state, but it prefers it to all others, provided that it he speedily made amply sufficient for Us present and prospective wants. It seems to ns therefore that the duty which the State owes to itself, as well as the West, should prompt It to speedy and efficient action in this matter. We trust that some method may be de vised during the present winter by which our Leg islature can be induced to inaugurate that Seat work, and put It In ihfi way of comple on. We trust that Gov. Fenton will allude to the matter with fitting emphasis In his forthcoming message* and* thereby bring It np at an eorlv day. Meanwhile we urge upon our citizens to take Imn&filatc actloo, to pro tect their own interests' £fid further those of the State at large. The time for action la at band, and If It Is postponed till another year it will ho too late. Central Illinois Synod.

About thirty-ffve . members were present, several of whom fined the various polplts of this place last Sabbath. The meetings were characterized with the greatest of harmony—closing yesterday after having finlsned all business brought before it, by tendering a vote of thanks to the citizens of Mattoon for the kindness and hospitality shown the members of the organization dar ing the scsalon- Tbe Railway Con vention of Farmers at De Kalb.
