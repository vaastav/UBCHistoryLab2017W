He was an upright, just man. an able judge and conscientious in the discharge of his otbeial duties al? most to a fault, if such a thing wot o possible. His menta! capacity and inclination for work were far be? yond his physical strength,and there is little doubt but the* too close ap? plication to the discharge of his du? ties shortened his days and deprived this judicial circuit of many years of able service at his hands. Judge Ma? son was a man of courtley manners and charming personality and it is doubtful if he had an enemy in the world. In the estimation of lawyers and friends he had elevated the ju? diciary of the State and his place will be hard to til!. His stricken family will have the sympathy of this entire community and we unite with them in mourning his loss. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE President Taft's message to <\>n gress exceeds in length any previous message and covers almost, if not every, topic of public importance. some briefly and some at length. The message is marked by conserva? tive utterance, which can ?always ?be expected from Mr. Taft.and contains nothing calculated to disturb busi? ness conditions at this time and therefore in this respect is pleasing. The President in view of the late election evidently did not fed that he could indulge in any very fervid defence of the tariff bill, though he g >es so far as to say that it has l?<.?-n misrepresented and misunderst'n??i. He is careful not to repeat that it is the best tariff bill the country has ever had and in fact takes up nearly all Ute space devoted to th ?s discussion of tl mission on whoa gress " ? ? ? ? recori.in?.r..:. ?the future. ?the mcaaeg? ing with the law's delays will meet hearty approval as will a numU-r of other minor r?. commendations. On the whole the message is what was exp?ect-?d from Mr. Taft. Had our colored population in? creased on the same ratio with the white Frederickburg woulc have passed the 6,000 mark, and would have done so anyhow had tht Council secure?! the annexation of the adjoining territory to which many of our people have removed. Congress starts up again and the weather is no doubt in keeping with the feelings of the many lame ducks in both houses.
