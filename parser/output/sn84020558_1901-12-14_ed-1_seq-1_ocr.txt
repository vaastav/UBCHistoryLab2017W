THE END OF IT Report Court Of Schley of Inquiry TWO REPORTS Eleven Findings Against The Admiral BY THE MAJORITY His Course In the Events Leading to and Attending the Battle of Santiago Bay Generally Sustained by Admiral Dewey Who Says rrv. ci,i TTTrt That Admiral Schley Was the ( Senior Officer in Command and : is Entitled to the Credit of That Glorious Victory, Washington. Dec. 13. The report of the Schley court of inquiry was pro mulgated by Secretary Xong tonight. There are two reports. Admiral Benham and Admiral Ram sey ebneur In the first, which is signed by Admiral Dewey also as a matter of form. Admiral Dewey makes a separate report, although Jie agrees with the findings of fact subscribed to by the otiiers. The majority report condemns Ad miral Schley on eleven points, while Admiral Dewey sustains him in most particulars. The majority opinion finds, in brief, that Admiral Schley should have proceeded with the utmost dispatch to Oienfuegos and maintained a close "blockade: that he should have endeavored to obtain information ot the Spanish Meet there; that he should have proceeded to Santiago with dispatch; that he should not have made the retrograde movement; that ho should have obeyed the department's j court and the defendant was bound to orders; that he should have endeavored . the grand Jury in the sum of J"00. to capture the Spanish vessels in San- Hackney is charged with having tlago; that he did not do his utmost broken into the holse of Mary E.

The '. session: of the court lasted one week 'short of three months in open session. , A month more was taken by the court to deliberate upon the testimony offered in open court. The result cames a a surprise. Both reports are signed by George Dewey, as president., and Samuel Lemly, as Jude advocate. This is the form said to be rfcognlzed in all courts of in quiry, the signatures of the other mem bers not being necessary. It Is explained that Adimral Dewey signed the second, a minority report, to express his quali fication of or dissent from the view a himself and Admirals Benham and ! national government.

The secretary of the navy received the reports at 5 o'clock this evening and has not yet acted upon them. It is probable that he will simply append his signature, with the WOrd "Ap- ! proved." to the whole record. The court Itself recommends no further proceed- ings. owing to the lapse of time.

Ho was seated in the public reception room of the Hotel Chittenden with friends and several newspaper men and evinced no signs of nervous ness over the outcome. When the conclusions of Admiral Dewey were read to him. Admiral Schley showed pleasure, and It was evi dent from his manner that he regarded the statement from Admiral Dewey as a vindication of his cause. He declined to make any statement concerning the court's findings and. excusing himself from the little company which was gathered about him, went to his apart ments, where Mrs. Schley had been srxiounly waiting to har the court's decision. Later an official copy Va brought to the hotel by a messenger from the navy department. 

HACKNEY HELD OVER No Defense Offered In Preliminary Examination. The preliminary examination of Mort Hackney, charged with burglary, took place yesterday in Justice Burnett's road near Five Points. Mrs. Jones testified to the disordered condition of her house on her return to It on Monday night an the broken box in which she had kept the coins. The pawnbroker identified Hackney as the man who had sold him the coins and J. C. Martinez identified him as a man who had inquired of him on the even ing of Monday where he ecu Id sell some old coins. There was other evidence, though it was net. necessary to introduce it for the purpose of the examination, calcu lated to destroy the effect of Hackney's story that he had found the coins. He was In town on horseback. The horse's feet were of unusual size and the tracks were found leading to the Jones house. It was also found that the anl mad had been tied In the vicinity of the house.

President Kocsavelt in his message has declared for a new national policy in" the handling of the public domain by the part of his message to congress to mat ters affecting the preservation of the forest and the conservation of the flood streams of the arid west with a view to their subsequent use in the cultiva tion of the arid public domain. He says: "Great storage works are neces- y i tquRiue me iiuw n -u.mo l" 4 "7 """" faction of which has been conclusive- Ehon to an undertaking too vat for Pf' ;ff?rt- tr fT"? accomplished by the Individual states cti" alone" Far reaching Interstate problems are involved, and the re- sources of single stateu would orten b Inadequate. It is properly a nationnl function. It is not enough to regulate the flow of streams; the object cf the government Is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it." While it is true that the national irri gation movement originated in the west, it is no longer an exclusive west ern idea, A great deal has been said about westerners getting together to light the east. The necessity for such i fight has gone, for a larger number of J members of congresit from eastern states are now in favor of national irri gation than the total representatives cf the arid states in that body. The assumotinn that the east is against the west in carrying out uhis policy Is an error. The principal support of the irrigation movement has come from people living east of the Mississippi river. Four-fifths of the members of the national irrigation associations ar found east of the Missouri river. President Roosevelt und the members of his cabinet have emphasized this fact in a most striking manner by adopting the arid land platform as their own. They have recla:ed emphatically for the construction of reservoirs and main liir? canals by the national gov ernment and their operation under gov ernment control. The astern men who have rallied to the support of the na tional Irrigation movement have been brought to this position by a reallzt on of the enormous value to the eastern cities and their many industries of the great and growing markets west of the Missouri, which have been built up al most entirely through the Irrigation of arid lands. The president and hii: secretary have declared for a clear cut national policy upon which the whole country can unite, and It remains to be "seen whether congress is ready to adopt this policy In its construction of the ap propriation bills. The effect of this attiiide of the presi dent is already apparent In the speech es and actions of quite a number of members of congress who one short year ago were openly antagonistic or selfishly Indifferent to tne national Irri gation movement, Mary of these men acknowledge the inevitability of gov ernment works at government expense. ana some or mem aarrit ineir desira bility. Those who still oppose appropri ations for this purpose base, their oppo sition purely upon economic grounds, but with the money available and the pressure of public sentiment demand ing, tangible returns for government In vestment, it is improbable that serious opposition will be made to an initia tory appropriation for carrying into effect the policy for improving the arid pubUe domain so as to render it avail able for home builders. ' The nationalizing of this policy by th president practically assures Its adop tion by the present congress, even though the first appropriation be smalt. The Irrigaticnists have teen contending for a principle. They will be well satis fied to see this principle adopted, leav ing to future sessions the question as to the amount of money to be spent each year in carrying it into effect. J. D.
