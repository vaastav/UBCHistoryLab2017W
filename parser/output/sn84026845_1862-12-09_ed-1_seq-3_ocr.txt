The weather during Saturday aod Sunday was exceedingly cold, and should it continue for twenty-four hours longer the river will undoubtedly be frozen over. The Allegheny was full of floating ice yesterday, but is, as yet, thin and scat lercd, and will not seriously interfere with navigation in the Ohio.

The Little Martin, for Zaneeville, and Cottage and R. B. Hamilton, for Cincinnati, with all the freight they could take, cleared on Saturday evening. There are quite a number of boats on the way up from Cincinnati, but it is hard ly possible that any of them will be able to get up until there is more water.
