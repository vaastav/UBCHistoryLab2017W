I ask attention to the report of the Post master General, the following being a sura mary sta ement of the condition of the De partment. The revenues ficm ail aourres during the fiscal year, ending the 30th June, 18*31, including the annual perma nent appropriation of seven hundred thou sand for the transportation of free mail mat ter, was $9,04!),29tl 4(4 being about two per cent, less than the Revenue of 1800.— The expenditures' were $13,006,709 11, showing a decrease of more than 8 per cent, a# compared with those of the previous var. and leaving an expenditure over the Rev enue for the fiscal year, of over $4,574,* 27 29. The gross Revenue for the year ending June 30th, 1803, is estimated at an increase of 4 per. cent on that of 1861. making $8,083 !t90, which should be added to the eari in s of the De artment for ca rying free matter, viz $7,UAC,*000. making 352,'OOfl. The total expenditures for lt'63 are estimated at $12i528.0't0. leaving an es timated dificiency of $:,345,000, to be sup plied from the Treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation. The present insurrection shows, think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac liver at the time of the estab lishment of the Capital here, was eminently wise, and consequently that the rei n rjuishmeutr of that portion of it which lies in the State of Virginia, was un wise and dangerous. I submit for your con sideration tlie expediency of retaining that part of the Distr ct and the restorat:on of the original boundaries thereof, through nego ciations with the State of Virginia.

The execution of the laws for the suppres sion of the African slave trade have en confined to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of congratulation that the efforts which have been made for the sup pression of this inhuman traffic have been recently attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and condemned. Two mas ters engaged in the trade and one person equipping vessels as slavers, have been con victed and suhjocted to the penalty of and imprisonment, and one Captain taking up a cargo of Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted nf the highest gi«de of offence under our laws, the punishment of which is death. The Territoiies of Colorado. Dacotah and Nevada, creited by ihe last Congress, have beer orgnn'zed and civil administration has been inaugurated therein, under au«.pics espcc'al'y gratifying, when it is consid«rtH\ that the leaven of treasoi^was found exist ing in some of these new countries, when the Fer'erd off cer arrived there. The abun dant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a large emigration when peace shall restoje the business of the country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolu tions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evinced the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory.

I have adhered to he act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary irposes. If a new law upon the same sub *ct shall be proposed, its propriety will be duly considered.

The last ray of hope for preserving the Un ion peaceably, expired at tho assault upon Fort Sumter, and a general roview of what What was painfully uncertain then, is much better defined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction.

This however, was soon settled, definitely, and on the right side, south of the line, noble little Delawaro lod off light from the first. Maryland was made to seem against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads torn up within her limits, and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the Capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and opened to the Government. She already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy, and her peo ple at a regular election have sustained the Union by a larger majority and a larger ag vrw nt« ro*» •h**! they mr b^f' T* -v its nature as not to have demanded and ex-j Missouri i comparatively quiet, and be- struggle of to-^ny is not altogether for to-1 resolution, ir.

The error is in assuming have been especially felt in the fljct for this purpose shall not degenerate that the whole labor of a community exists struggle. I hive, herefore, thought proper ®nd that the few avoid labor and wiih their to keep the integrity of the Union prominent capital hire or buy a few to labor for them V large majority belong to neither class, neither work for others or have others work for them, (n most of the Southern States a majority of the people of all colors are nei ther slaved nor masters, while in the Northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Merj with their families, wives, sons and daughters, work for themselves on their farms, in their houses, and in their shops, taking the whole products to them selves and asking no favors of capital, on one band, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their own labor with capital that is they labor with their own hands, and also buv or hire others to labor for them. But this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class. Again, as has already been saiil, there is not of necessity, any such thing as the free hired laborer being fixed in that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives were hired laborers. The most prudent, penniless laborer in tbe world la!ors for wages awhile and saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, he then labors on his own account and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the ju and generous and prsoperous system which opens the «aj- to all, gives hope to all, and the consequent energy, progress, and improvement of the condition of all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up or on from poverty—n ine less inclined to take or trench ought which they hnve not earned, let them l»eware of surrendering a political power which they already pos sess, and which if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new dis abilities and burdens upon them, until all of liSerty shall be lotxt. From the fir 4 taking of our National Cen sus to the last are 70 years, and we find our population fit the end of the period, eight times aa great as it was in the beginning.— The increan* of those other things which men dectn deservable, have even been great er.
