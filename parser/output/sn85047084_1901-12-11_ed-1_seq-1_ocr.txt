An important tariff case, affecting four sugar i.i ins in Hawaii, has just been de cided adversely to them in New York by Appraiser Jewel and Mr. William Hay- wo. d, the agent of the sugar planters in this city, is preparing a protest that wi I send the case before the full board of appraisers. The lirms affected, are Hack feld St Co., Irwin &. Co., Alexander & Baldwin and Grint-aum & Co. Thj con troversy has been over diuy on bag; in which sugar is packed. The Hawaiian lirms entered thc:n at a valua'lon the same as the cost price some year or sj ago, following the l.w that has always prevailed la Hawaii. How. ver, in the last year the price of bags has increased tfl per cent or 50 per cent, and he was of the United States specifically declare that the valuation must be th" market price at the time the articles are enur ed, lhe difference in the amount of duty is not very much, but unfortunately for the Hawaiian tirins, u heavy penalty lo inflicted for violating the law. Further mere, Congress provided that the board of appraisers should net take any cog nizance of the equities in such cases. Accordingly, It looks rather unfavor able for the firms involved in the con troversy, although the penalties, while they might teem large, will by n 0 means prove a setback to the firms if they have to pay them. Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Atherton, who have been stopping with friends In Baltimore, were in Washington Nov. 23, and enjoy ed a tine drive about the city. They were planning to leave Baltimore Nov. 27 for the Pacific coast. Mr. William Haywood has been laid up with the grip for some days, since he returned from New York, where there was a hearing on the sugar bags case, above referred to.

I hold the acceptance by a member of this synod of the office of delecate of mem bers or attendants of the Anglican Church of Hawaii to be subversive of the first principles of constitutional gov ernment, which I have labored to estab lish In fhis diocese. On two of the' occa sions on which I was defendant in a case before the Supreme Court, the generally reclved opinion was that there would have been no case at all except for the 'diosyncracles of the perverse and obsti nate disposition of the bishop. There i Were few who understood at the time . miii th- mr-tt'-r for which I was con tending was whether the authority of this synod, on the lines laid down at I.ambeth. was to tie paramount over all members of the AncPcnn Church In Ha waii, oi was to be subject to external Influence or controlled by curbstone leg islation. The point for which I contend ed was gained, and this synod has re enacted certain regulations of the dio cesan synod, which It was the purpose of the appeal to the Supreme Court to make null and void.

Probably something of Its ch".r acter and something about the recom mendations can be forwarded by the nf xt mail cr by a mail early in December- The annual report of Third Assistant Postmaster-General E. C. Madden ytl. There are two provisions covering vegetables. One provides the vegetables In their natural state and the ether pro vides for vegetables prepared or In other than their natural state. When vegeta bles are cut up and subjected to a proc ess of washing and drying, they are certainly no longer in their natural eta. btates by lower tari.T rates on tobacco and sugar would be sufficient to make such legislation very difficult. Lower tariff on tobacco, for instance, would strike at hundreds of small manufactur ers of tobacco throughout the country." The Cubans, who are pressing the prop aganda for lower tariffs on sugar and to bacco, had an audience with President Roosevelt Nov. 25. They presented peti tions from the industrial orginazatlons of the Island urging the. necessity of re ducing the tariff on tobacco and sugar. Jesides calling on the president the- del egation also saw Secretary Oage and Secretary Root. The delegation consist ed of Francisco Gamba, president of the General Society of Merchants an 1 Busi ness Men of Cuba; Miguel Mendoza. Si mon Dumois, Lo.ils Franc-ke, Gustav Bock, Dionblo Yelasco, Juan Pedro, and Alfonso Tesant. The delegation was ac companied by State Senator Frank B. I'avey, the American counsel of the Gen eral Society; Octario Davis, the secretary Of the delegation; and L. V. de Abad. a member of the former Cuban delegation on economic affa rs, which visited Wash ington last winter. After stating in a general way the eco nomic situation in the Island, the peti tion asks for a number of redactions in the American tariff on Cuban products. The petition goes on to say that the eco nomical situation in which the island of Cuba is placed Is such that the remedies above expressed admit of no delay. It concludes as follows: "We. therefore respectfully entreat you, either by virtue of the constitutional au thority vested in you, or by requesting Congress In your first message to grant you the necessary authority, to immedi ately establish ample commercial privi leges between the United States the al most exclusive market for our products and Cuba, based on the forecoir.ir neti- tion, as a measure of urgent necessity and indispensable for the salvation of the island." The Cubans have no Intention of rest ing on their oars. They will keep rep rescntatlves in the national capital all this winter to press their cause before Congress, and to furnish any information cn the subject of tariff that may be re quired of them. The forces against them are very strong, including the beet sugar growers, the Louisiana cane growers and tobacco interests of the country general ly, not to mention the Florida people, who fear lest the next thing may be lower duties on fruits from Cuba. The Cubans will be aided much In their cause by the recommendaUo-is in the president's message that the tariff on Cuban sugar be reduced In return for trade concessions. While at this writing the exact language of the message, which will not he made public till next Tuesday, Is not known, the president ha. stated to several callers that that was what he intended to recommend. He als- Intends to recommend the reduction of duty on sugar from the Ph Upplnes, eo that the product from those Islands as well as from Cuba, will be something on a par with the sugar from Hawaii.

He visit ed the White House Nov. 27, and as he left declared his firm conviction that Ha waiian sugar Dlar'ers would not be al lowed to brir g in Chinese or other labor era that were excluded from the States. AWAIIANS who have read and considered the message of the President see In the ref?rence to Hawaii an indication that there will be Fa thorough investigation of the land conditions. The consensus is that Con gress will not go the length of changing the system of land tenure and settle ment here without first becoming thor oughly acquainted with the methods which govern the public domain. "It has always been the hope o the local government that there should b" drawn to the Islands small farmers,'' said Mr. W. O. Smith yesterday, "and the laws were framed to make this pos sible. In the leases which have been made in recent years there 1s a clause which permits the taking over by the government of such lands as may be useful for homesteads and this very in terest shown in the securing of farmers has been the rule which has governed the entire policy of the government. We all hope to see the day when the amall farmers will have market for their out put to the extent that the lands of the Territory which are available for the cultivation of varied crops will be filled with home-makers. "Personally I do not see that there will be such a consummation for many years. There will be a great future for small farming when the time comes that through rapid service it will be possible to send various kinds of fruits and vegetables to California during the season w hen the crops there are not In the market. Then, too, the time is not far distant when through the increased business of this port there will be a constant market here for the output of the farms, which will enable the farm ers to secure a remunerative return upon their investment and for their la bors. "None of us want to see this country become an Oriental district. It was par tially my fear that this would result that made me an annexationist, though for many years I doubted the wisdom of that policy. We want a good citi zenship and when the time comes that the small farmer will be able to main tain his family and educate his children from the products of his farm, the peo ple of the Territory will welcome the day." "In my opinion there Is a lack of com plete understanding of conditions upon the part of the President," said Mr. E D. Tenney of Castle & Cooke yeste rday, "and I am hopeful that there will be nothing done until there ha.- been a careful examination of the lands and the system und-.-r which they are held and distributed. Should this be done there will be such adaptations of the system which is In force .n the rest of the United States as will give to this country the alterations which are nec essary to properly protect the Indus tries and the people as well. There are conditions here which obtain in no oth er State or Territory, ano these should be considered by a commission before there is legislation which would affect the lands. "The physical conformation of the Isl ands would render in , osslble the di rect appllcaton of the homestead lawa. There would be lands which would be as useless as a quarter-section in the Nevada desert or upon the top ot the Rocky mountains. For instance, a ku leana in the midcle of a great planta tion would be worth not a co'llar an acre, unless there was an agre.ment which would provide for the water for its cultivation. A quarter section In Ewa plantation alone would not be orth settling upon by a farmer, unless he had perhaps $20),(M) to put down a r'imr.ing plant for the securing of wa ter for the Irrigation of his crop.
