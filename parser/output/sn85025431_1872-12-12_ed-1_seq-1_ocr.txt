The last issue of the Marquette Journal contains the following interesting infor­ mation concerning the discoveries .of aneient copper mining on Isle Royale Copper mining^ on Isle Royale now affording considerable promise for future profit,"and there is not a doubt that should the price of copper remain at its present rate this field will yet be handled to great advantage. The'finding of tools, in old pits, long since abandoned by a race of men now extinct, still con­ tinues. These tools are of wonderful workmanship, formed of copper, with a temper and hardness scarcely excelled by the best steel tools of to-day. They are simply chiself, in- the ordinary form*, with hammers -copper, and huge granite hammers which seem to have been fnqdft more for the efficiency of their weight than for their power to resist the action of blows. The presence of charcoal here and there, in tbe depths of these abandon­ ed pits, seems to indicate that fire was used in the bottom of the mines to assist in mining or reduoing the ores. No other evidence, except that of an imperishable nature, is found to show when or by whow these deposits were worked. But that the whole history of 'these early operations should be buried in oblivion is a matter greatly resetted by all who have had their attention drawn to them. And now, since the closest research has failed to bring a glimmer of light out of this dark, hidden history, it is not at all likely that the world will ever know uugbt more of it" A striking and Beautiful Custom.

TSXASUB* DEPARTMENT, December 2d, 1872. SIB:—What degree of success has attended tbe administration of the Treasury Denai t ment during the year i« due largely tothe ability and ilaelity of the officers and clerks of the several bureaus and divisions. There has been some exception to the general cood con­ duct of the working force, but tbe number ot these will not to be thought larce when it ia kuown that more than 3wo em! ployed ID Washington, ol whom nearlv 1400 are constantly engaged in handling coin, notes and money secuntfes of the government. Many of these persons are paid fair wages for the services rendered, but others who fill places of great responsibility are not, by any means, adequately compensated. Officers and clerks of known ability and established repu talion are frequently drawn away by offers of better pay elsewhere. This competition will •eavetne business of the department finally in the hands of the less valuable part of its officers. A sense of justice leads me to re command an increase of salaries of tho Assist­ ant Secretaries of the Treasury. THE FIVE FEE CERT.

The cost of these bonds estimated in gold has va­ ried Irom $82.21 per 9100 to 999.99 per *lt)0 tbe moet recent purchases being at the rate oi $98.66 per 9100. The- average cost in gold ol the whole amount of tbe purchases up to and including tbe last day of September was 994.64 per $100. In this connection I would call attention totbo various tables accompany­ ing this report, which furnish elaborate de­ tails of tbe money operations and accounts ot tbe Government. THE CARRYING TRADE. The condition of our carrying trade with foreign countries is always a subject of inter­ est, and at tbe'present moment is one of solici­ tude. Tho imports and exports of tbe United States, including gold and silver, amounted to 91,070,641,163, for tbe fiscal year ending June 80,1872 and of this vast trade only 281-2 per cent, was in American vessels. Iu the vear 18GGnearly 71 per cent, of our foieign com­ merce was in American ships, but in 1864 it had fallen to 46 per cent, in 1868 to 44 per cent and in 1871 to leas than 3( per cent. The earnings of vessels engaged in the foreign carrying trade probably exceeded $100,000,000 a year, of which less than one-third is earned under our own flag. The acts of Congress allowing a drawback on foreign articles used in the construction of American vessels has given encouragement to shipbuilding, but I am of tbe opinion that the measure is entirely in­ adequate. VVnen we consider that nearly three-fourths of tbe foreign commerce of the country is un­ der foreign flags, it is plain that there can be no considerable or speedy change unless the Government shall act at once, and in a liberal and comprehensive spirit. The rise in the price of iron and the advance of wages of labor in England during the pastyear favor the Gov­ ernment and people of the United States, but this advantage, due to national causes, should not lead us to trust the future to the force of these causes, but should induce us rather to act at once and with vigor. It may happen that we cannot regain the control of the dire 4 trade between Europe and the United States, but there is an im­ mense field to be occupied upon the Pacific Ocean, and in the South Atlantic. England controls the markets of the world by controlling the channels of communication. 1 am convinced that a wonderful impetus will be given to the agricultural and manu­ facturing interests of the country by the in­ crease or our commercial marine. Merchants in distant countries must purchase goods at points with which they have frequent and regular communication, and when such com­ munication exists with one country only the cost of merchandise becomes unimportant, as there are no means of comparison, nor is there opportunity for the advantages oljcompetition hence a great producing country can afford to establish and maintain lines of steamships up­ on the ocean, as the indirect benefits will much lessen the cost. EXPOBTS AND IMPOSTS. The details of our trade with foreign coun­ tries, as represented by the returns to tho statistical bureau, are also unsatisfactory. From these returns it appears that tbe imports of merchandise for the fiscal year ending June 30tli, 1872, were $026,595,077, and the exports estimated in gold were $444,046,086 showing a balance against tho country of $182,548,991. This balanco is in some degree apparent rath­ er than real. On the 30th or June, 1871, the value of goods remaining in warehouses was $68,324,659, while on the 30th of June, 1872, it was $122,211,266, showing an excess at the close of the last fiscal year of $43,886,607. De­ ducting this excels, we have a balance based upon the actual consumption of the country of $128,662,384. From this a further reduc­ tion should be made of $66,133,845, being tbe excess of exports over the imports of gold. After these deductions there still remains an adverse balance of $62,528,539. Tliis adverse balance has beon met probably by freight on merchandise carried iu American vessels, profits on exports made on account of Amer­ ican merchants and shippers, the sale of bonds abroad, and tho investments in tho United States by inhabitants of other countries. The exports of merchandise for tho year 1872 were $13,298,933 less than for tuu year 1871. Tne exports of wheat, wheat flour, raw cotton, cot­ ton manufactures, gold and silver, firearms, manufactures of leather, illuminatme oil and beef, fall off $82,066,325, while there was again p* $68,767,392 io th© exports of corn, furs, hides, ekins, bacon, hams, lard, loaf tobacco, manufactures of iron, wood, leather and minor articles. There was an increase of exports in every branch of manufactures, except cotton, leather and firearms. Tbo decrease of our ex­ ports in wheat and wheat flour was $12,000,000. raw cotton $37,000,000. manufactured cotton $1,250,000, gold and silver export $11,600,000, firearms $12,000,000, manufacturers of leather $600,000, illuminating oils $3,500,000, and beef VAUU,UL)U. 'r'^ "'^'"ties of imports show an increase or $700,000 in coffee, $18,000,000 in snirar. $3,000,000 in tin plates, mora than $17. «n raw wool, $2,000,000 111 pig iroil, $10,000,000 in manufactures of iron, $5,G00 000 in manufactures of cotton, 4,000,000 in the manufacture of silk, ami about $70,400,000 in niaiiurac'nreH of wool. Tbe statistics arc not presented an affording a basis for legislation, nnl rather Ix.'caus they aro exceptional in character and not likely to IM repeated. SILVK.U Atfb BASE COIN.

The intrinsic value or a metallic cur­ rency should correspond to its commercial valuo, or the metal should be used only for tho coinage of tokens re uci'iuablo by tbo Government at their nouti* nal value. AH the depreciation of silver IS likely to continue, it is impossible to issue coin redeemable in gold without ultimate loss to the Government, for when the difference be­ comes considerable, holdera will present the Hlver for redemption and leave it in the hands of the Government to be disposed of. Subse­ quently it Is a loss. If the policy should bo adopted of issuing silver com irredeemable, but whose lutrnisic value should correspond, the tinio must came when the country should suffer fiom the proueuceof a depreciated silver currency not redeemable by the Government nor current in tho channels of trade. Tokens ol base coin, except for small denominations, are less convenient than paoer, and are sub* jeet to many oilier serious objections.

I think it practicable, through the Post-office Department, to make an arrangement by which the whole country shall be supplied with fresh issues of fractional currency there­ fore, in renewing tb&flSinimendatioiiu here­ tofore made for the passage of the mint bill, 1 Suggest such alterations as will provide tho coinage of silver for circulation in tnis country, but that authority be given for the coinage oi every dollar that shill be as valuable as the Mexican dollar, and to be furnished at its ac­ tual cost. The Mexican dollai is used general­ ly in trade with China,and is now sold at a pre­ mium of about eight per cent, ovor the actual expense of coiuing. As the production of sil­ ver is rapidly increasing, such a coinage will at once furnish a market for the raw material and facilitate commerce between tho United States abd Ciiina. It is no exaggeration to say that a necessity exists for anew issue of national bank notes. The reasons for such issue were given in my last annual report. EMBEZZLEMENTS. The Secretary renews his recommendation for the passage of a law relieving the Treasury from responsibility for the embezzlements of clerks Johnson and Worden, amountiu to $40,635. fie also recommends the passage of a law relieving Assistant Treasurer Hill house, at New York, from responsibility for tbe embezzlement of James I. Johnson in the stamp department, ss'the business of keeping and selling stamps was not properly apart ol the duties pertaiuing to the office of Assistant Treasurer, and as he would be entitled to more than half a million dollars commission if ho had been allowed the same rates as are allowed to outsiders. PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 1 he Secretary says that large sums will be needed for the completion of the buildings al­ ready begun, and ho advises that no new onca be undertaken beyond the erection of a pavil­ ion hospital and building for the accommoda­ tion of the department of engraving and priuting,and the storage of books and papers. As buildings were burned off ot the east side or the square on which is the site of the uew postoffice in Boston, he recommends that the remainder be purchased by tbe govern­ ment. The cost of proposed sites for the projected new government buildings in Philadelphia and Cincinnati the Secretaiy funds will be so much tnat tbe appropriations will not cover it and erect the buildings in tho style designed,there­ fore be has not proceeded with them. TBE BEVENUE KABIME. The operations or tbe Coast Survey, as well tboso or the Light House Board, appear to be economically and efficiently managed. The revenne marine consists of 27 steam and six sailing vessels, carrying 45 guns and manned by 198 officers and 860 men This service has constantly improved in effictcncy and in the economy of its management since tbe summer of 1869. At that time a commis­ sion was appointed for the general and pro­ fessional examination of all the officers em­ ployed, and upon their report 39 were dis­ charged, and tLose who were approved were assigned to duty and given rank according to merits. From that time to the present, vacan­ cies in the Bcrvice have been filled after an ex­ amination and by those found to ba best quali­ fied. At the same time a commission was ap­ pointed for the entire revision of the service. Measures have boon taken, says the Secre­ tary, which will reduce the tonnage from 9,208 tons to 7,319. Tbe cost of maintaining the revenue marine has been reduced from $129,366,167 in 1868 to $93,024,981 for tbe year ending June 30th, 1872. A statistical table prepared from th« returns'shows tbe essential particulars of as­ sistant rendered to vessels, the seizures made, the number of vessels examined, and the number of lives saved upon the ocean and lakes. The work performed during the last fiscal year is nearly twice as great aa the aver­ age ot the ten preceding years. The Secretary recommends that, on account of tbe hazardous nature of the revenue ser­ vice, from the trequent calls that are upon it to rescue life and property during storms, the navy pension laws he-made appli­ cable to the officers and marina3 of this ser­ vice. The benefits resulting from the appropria­ tion for more effectually aecuring life and property on the coast of New Jersey, by the repair and construction of lite saying stations are recounted, and the extension of tba meas­ ure southward on tho eoast is recommended. Tbe condition of the hospitals and certain recommendations of a minor character, occu­ py a paragraph in tho report. The act to pro­ vide for the better security of life on board of steam vessels is commended, thongh it has not been in operation long enough thoroughly to test its value. THE CUSTOM LAWS. On the 26th day of May, 1872,1 transmitted to Congress a bill entitled A bill to amend and consolidate tbe navigation and custom laws of the United States," together with a communication explaining the character and purpose of the measure, Ex. Doc. 290, Forty second Congress, second session. I respect­ fully ask the attention of Congress to the bill, and the reasons for it. The attention of the public is turned naturally to the future. The financial policy must rest upon the past and the present. The war caused three great changes in business and financial affairs that have received the caceful coasideration or the American people. Firs*, the country was compelled to impose hea\ istoms duties on merchandise. Thus, without general observation and without ar­ gument on the principles involved, tbe na­ tion entered upon a broad svstem of protecr tion. Second, the Government issued treasury notes for general circulation ai currency, and prohibited banks of issue by state authority. Third, a system of national banks was es­ tablished, and their circulation protected by national credit. The wisdom of tne measures, speaking generally, has been established, and subject to such changes as the changing con­ dition and opinions of tho country and people may demand, tliey will remaiu a part of our public policy until the financial consequcnces of the war disappears. THE PROTECTIVE POLICY. The weight of the uational debt has baen so great that for more than ten years there ha been no opportunity for the practical discus­ sion of the doctrines of protection and tree trade, and in that long period of unchanged protective policy incident to the burdens of tbe war, ihe nation has advanced rapidly and safely in tho development of its national resources. Anticipating a condition of peace, we may also anticipate a gen­ eral reduction iu tho percentage of customs duties. Ibis reduction, however, should not bo measured solely bv tho wauts of the Treasuiy, but regard should' b» bad, also, to the conditiou of the various branches of in­ dustry in whicn the people are engaged. In presence of tho fact that the leading pursuits cf tho country arc stronger than ever before in the possession of adequate cnpital and a sup­ ply of intelligent laborers, there may be a moderate reduction from time te time in the rato of duties as the diminishing expenses of the Government shall permit, without alarm­ ing caoital or injuring labor. For the purposes of government, the prin­ ciples of political economy are national, and not eosmo| o'itdn. A nation that can produce a given article at less cost than it can be pro­ duced elsewhere may wisely accept froe trado in it, but a nation having natural advantages for its production, yet destitute of skill in the incident art ot trade, must wait for tho oppor­ tunity that sometimes cornea from tho calam­ ity ol war, or secure a more economical and a more constant support in the policy of its government. If average natural facilities ex­ ist, the period ot necessary protection is a short time compared with the life-time of a nation, whiio the advsntages gained cin novel' be wholly lost but if reasonable natural facilities do not exist, thcu a system of duties fur protection is a present and future burdcu without adequate compensation. So varied aud rich, however, are tho natural resources of the Uniteil States, that we either aru or may soon bo in successful competition with thf older aud more experienced countries of tho world in Ihe production of the chief aiticles of persoiuil necessity, comfort ami liiNiirv, and or the machinery by which tlies" articles'are in. dll -i 'l or ollitiued. Herein a sufficient jti Ulimiioii for t'u-existing protective sy*t-in, and f.:r its continuance 

COUNTY TRANSCRIPT. turbed by (he circumstance that wages of la­ bor arc higher in this country than in those of the Old World. Ton years sinco it was the thought of many that the only way to success fully compote with Europe was in the reduc­ tion of tho standard. That thought has dis­ appeared, probably in tbe presence of tbo fact Uiat high wages on this side of the Atlantic have stimulated immigration until there is a near approaoh to equality in the cost of labor, and of the co-existing fact that the ad­ dition thus made to tbe number of laborers has Only aided in this development of our re­ sources, without yielding in any quarter an excess of products, or retard­ ing in any degree the prosperity of the laboring population. This pros­ perity on their part is associated with a higher and constantly improving intellectual and so­ cial culture and condition. It being given that an intelligent person has all the Special knowl­ edge of an art and trade possessed by the most experienced and best trained operative, who, outside of this special training and expe rionco is ignorant, ana machinery being given also, the intelligent person, proceeding for a term, will improve and simply tbe methods of production to DuCh ail extent as to cause an addition to his wages. Even one hundred per cent, represents but a small part Of the advan­ tages gained there is the speoiat training and knowledge of the ignorant masses of tho im­ provements made. Tliis truth, considered with reference to a single American laborer, and then multiplied a hundred thousand times, re- Slurope resents the advantage ot America over and Asia in their contest for national peaceful suppremacy in the Afiairs of the w°rld. Thus is America solving the industrial problem ot the ages by extorting cheap produc­ tion from expensive labor. The reason for these remarks may be found in the opinion I enter­ tain that the tariff system of the country has contributed largely to the general prosperity, and that such general and continued prosper­ ity is the only basis on which even a wise finan­ cial policy can rest. TEE CUBBENOI AND BANKS. tn discussing the other changes caused by the war, issues of United States notes and of notes by the national banks should le consid­ ered together. Indeed, they aro necessary partB of onr financial system. Neither can be substituted for the other without general dis­ turbances to the Btate bank system, and to any system ot private banks. The substitu­ tion of an equal amount ot United States notes as currency, would be a cause or serious evils and losses. First, tho national banks hold nearly $400,000,000 United States bonds, which otherwise would be thrown upon the market, absorbing domestic capital, or, it pur­ chased abroad, adding by the amount or inter­ est to the annual balances against the United States in our account current with other countries second, one office or a Upon these views I form the conclusion tw. the circulation of tbe banks should be fixed aodjimited, and that tbe power to change the volume of paper in circulation within the limits established bv law should remain in the Treasury Department. A dis­ cretion as to the volume of currency is twntlil for two reasons: First, the business of tbe department cannot be transacted properly if a limit ia fixed, and the power to raise tbe circulation above or reduoe below that limit is denied. A rule of this nature would o^mpel the Secretary to accumulate a large currency bal­ ance, and to hold it, as otherwise the credit of the government in making tbe ordinary «M on it, would be at the mercy of every serious business and political revolution in the Unite States or Europe, Especially would thtajte true now that onr ordinary currency expendlt pertly in exoeas of our currency revenue. Secondly, there is a netoesaife every autumn for moving the crops without delay from the south and west to the seaboard, that they may be on hand for export and consumption as wanted. This work should be dime in the main before the lakes, riven and canals are closed and yet it cannot tw without the nse of large amounts of currenoy. in the summer money lunds accumulate at the cen­ tres, bnt the renewal of business in August and September gives employment for large sums and leaven little or nothing for forwarding tlie crops in October and November. Nor would this difllculty be abated by a permanent increase 01 apermsnrat reduction of the volume of the currency. The dif­ ficulty is due to the natural order of things, and increases with the prosperity of the conn try, as shown in the abundance of its harvests. The crops cannot be moved oenerally bv the aid of bank balances, checks and letters of cred­ it, but only by bank notes and United States notes paid st oaoe to the producers. This money finds its way speedily into the channels of-trade and to the commercial centres, bnt it will be allowed to re­ main for general use. After the reason for its issue has ceased, the volume of currency would be in­ creased permanently, and the year following the same process would be repeated with the same re­ sults, and thus would the country depart more and more widely from the policy of resumption. The problem is to And a way far Increasing the curren­ oy for moving the crops, and dii»inMii». it at once when tuat work is done. This is a necessary work, and inasmuch as it cannot be oonfided in the banks, where, bnt in tbe Treasury Department, can the power be reposed? While tbe currency revenue was in excess of the currency expenses it wss practtcsl to accumulste large bti anoes in the Treasury during the summer, to be used, if necessary, in the purchase of tho bonds in the autumn, thereby meeting the usual demand for currenoy at that season of the year, and thereafter such accumulation must be made by the sale of gold in large quantities during the summer, when busi­ ness is least active, and' may not always be consistent with the best interests of the country. cannot therefore, be placed upon tbe sbiHty of the Treasury to accumulate a currency balanoe each year for the purpose indicated. The argument in favor of a paper currency com­ posed in part of United States notes and in part of national bank notes is strengthened by the aid which msy thus be furnished in resuming snd maintaining specie payments. In the view I am now to take, I exclude tne idea that the government will ever abandon the issue of nattonalbank notes and undertake the issue of United States notes in their plaoe. The result of such a policy may be foreseen. The people, deprived of the facilities for business afforded by banks, would seek relief through state institutions, and without much delay Congress would concede to them tho right to issue notes for circulation. This concession would be followed by a surrender by the general govern­ ment of all control over the paper circulation of the country. The true policy will be found in continu­ ing the national banking aystem, without, however, yielding the increase of its issue in proportion to the volume of paper In circulation. There are two certain and efleetual ways of placing the country in a condition when specie and psper will possess the same commercial value. By diminishing the amount of paper tp circulation the difference be­ tween the commercial value of paper and coin will diminish, and to pursuing this policy the difference will disappear altogether. All legislation limited in operation to paper issues of banks, and of the gov­ ernment, whether bearing interest or not any, which in effect shall tend to diminish the market valuo of coin, will be found upon analysis certain plan for contracting the volume of paper currency and all legislation so limited which does not con­ tain such a plan will prove ineffectual. Accepting ths proposition, and believing the coun­ try not prepared to sustain the policy of contraction, It only remains for me to eonsider the means br whioh tbe value ol our currency may be Improved, 1 he basis of a policy of Improvement must be found iu a steady refusal to add to the paper in circulation until it Is of the same value substantially as coin. This being accepted as the settled poller of tbe country, there can be no permanent Increase of the Mtt 1 psper and coin, and an npportu [or the Influence of natural cau»ea difference between. nity will be given for tendln* upon the whole to a better financial condi tlon. We may count, first, among these, an increase of population and tta distribution over new fieldaof bualnesa and labor aeeondly in the 8outb, especially the number of persons hsvlng property, using and holding money, will inereaae. next, we may antlci* pate a more general use of paper In Texaa aud the Pacific states, by which, praetlsaliy, for the reatof the eountry, the volume of paper will be diminished and the quantity of coin increased. Two facta tend ing to produoe an equality of value in tbe intlnenoes of these natural causos will be counteracted in some degree by the Increasing facility for the traneferof manor from one point to another, aud by the From January W«l Slid tor tbe corresponding bank, to ag­ gregate the capital or small possessors, and thereby to furnish means in aid of important commercial and financial undertakings, not only at the centers, but iu the remote and newly settled parts of the country third, the national banks aroused as aids to tbe Govern• ment, which otherwise would require a large increase in the number of designated deposi­ tories and a proportional increase of tbe public expenses without the least appreciablea dvan tago fourth, they facilitate exchange between sections of the country, and thus diminish the cost of commercial transportation* fifth, they are generally less disposed than private par­ ties controlling equal capital, to demand exor­ bitant rates of interest. But it docs not follow from thesa views, nor would it follow from those of a similar char acter which might be presented, that the ?yg tem is perfect nor does it follow that tbe is­ sue of notes directly by the government shoud be surrendered and tbe bnsiHess of far nisbing a currency yielded to the national binks. The circulation of each bank is fixed arbitrarily by a rule of law. The aggregate circulation is, therefore a fixed BUQI. and con­ sequently there is practicably no reserve to meet the increased demand for money occa­ sionally to extraordinary events at home or abroad, and arising occasionally with the in­ coming of the harvest. The old state bank system is sometimes commended for a quality termed elasticity," but that quality, found in that system, was the prin­ cipal source of financial disaster. Un­ der that system, in obeyance of the present demand for coin, there was practically no limit to the issue of a paper currency. An in­ crease or circulation was attended and follow­ ed by an advance in prices, excessive importa­ tions, a consequent demand for coin drawn from the btuks to meet balances abroad, a simultaneous reduction of the paper currency, and the consequent distress of merchants atid bankers. The circulation of a bank is a source of profit, and the managers are usually disposed to oblige their patrons by loans ana accomodations. It can never be wise to allow banks and parlies who have pecuniary interests at stake to increase or diminish the volume of currency, in the country at their pleasure. Nor do I find in the condition of them a law or rules on which we can safely rely. greater use of bank checks and certificates ot deposit. Tbe rapid transit of merchandise, in bringing the period of its consumption nesrer the time of its production, is an ageney of a similar sore. Giving those views their full weight, 1 sm pre­ pared to say that the experience of the last three year4 coincides with the best judgment 1 can forui, and wnnrants the opinion that under the infiuenco 01 the exiatlng natural cauos,our financial condition has gradually Improved.

ProMctings in Oenri'Ms* SENATE.—The Senate met' at noon on December 2d, tbe Vicc-Preeideat in the chair, axd all leading Senators present. A number of bills were introduced, among them one by Mr. Sumner, as follows: Wherea*, National unity and good-will among fellow citizens ean .a*?U'ed on'y through the oblivion of past differences, aud it is contrary to tbe usage of civilized nations to perpetuate the memory of civil war, therefore be it enacted, &c., that tba names of battles with fellow citizens shall not be eontinutd in the army register or placed on the regimen­ tal coloia of the United States. Tbe credentials ol General Uatehin, senior, to succeed Garrett Davis, of Kentucky, and Itr. Morrill, from Vermont, were present­ ed. Mr. Wilson introduced a bill for the relief of sufferers by tbe Boston flr». This bill is similar to tbe bill for the relief of the Chicago sufferers. Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania, in­ troduced a bill granting a pension of $3,008 a year to Ihe widw of Gen. Meade. A message waa received from the House announcing tne adoption of a concurrent resolution in regard to tba death of Horace Greeley. Mr. Fenten moved immediate consideration, and it was unanimously agreed to. The President's message was then received and read by the Clerk. HOUSE.—The House was called to or der by Speaker Blaine. The following new members sworn in: Jas. E. Hawley, of Conn. Constantine G. Est.v, of Mass. O. T. Dodds, of Ohio, and Erasmus W. Beck, of Georgia. Mr. Banks offerad his resignation as chair­ man of tbe Committee on Foreign Affairs, but tho House, by a vote of 76 to 59. refuted to ac­ cept it. Speaker Blaine then called Mr. Cox, ot New York, to the chair as Speaker pro tem,and took the floor to offer the following resolution: Whereas, accusations have been made in the public press, founded on tbe alleged letters of Oakes Ames,a Representative from Massachu­ setts, and upon tbo afkdavit. of Henry Mc Comb, a citizen of Wilmington, in the state of Delaware, to the effect that members of tbe House were bribed by Oakes Ames to perform certain legislative aets for the benefit of the Union Pacific Railroad Company by presents of stock in tbe Credit Mobilier of America, or by presents of a valuable character derived therefrom therefore, resolved that a special committee of five members be appointed by tho Speaker pro tem­ pore, whose duty it shall be to investigate and ascertain whether any member of this house was bribed by Oakea Ames, or anv person or corporation, in any matter touching his legis­ lative duty, and that thecommitieeneauthor­ ized to send for persons and papers. Mr. Blaine said he bad requested Mr. Cox to ap­ point a majority ot Democrats on the commit tee, and made a few remarks challenging investigation. The resolution was aaopted with a few negative votes on the Democratic side, and Mr. Cox, as Speaker pro tem, ap­ pointed as the select committee Messrs. Po­ land, Banks, Beck, Niblack and MeCarry. Mr. Dawes offend a resolution of regret at tbe death of Mr. Greeley, which was adopted. The message was then read, and the House soon after adjourned.

Greeley, Bennett, and Rajmend. The Sunday Mercury of Dee. 1st, contained the following: Three of the great editors who made the press of New York famous through­ out the world and a guiding star and bright exemplar to the journalistic fra­ ternity everywhere are no more. The relentless harvester, death, has gather­ ed them to his fold and those who for a brief period survive them remain to monrn their loss. Baymond and Bennett preceded Greeley on the dark unknown voyage to the hereafter, but neither of the two former has left such avoid as the last and greatest of the three. There is semething philosophically pe culinr in the thought that in trignome try, three united in one complete a problem, so in the rise and progress of American journalism, to the pres­ ent unapproachable high and com­ manding position, the genius and la­ bors of these three eminent men con enrred, each in his own characteristic and individual way. While Henry J. Baymond inculcated a style of contro­ versial discussion, elevated in tone, terse in argument, mild in reproof, and rich in facts, James Gordon Bennett threw his whole inventive^ rest less energy into the domain of news, and challenged the world to follow him in this, his well ch*8en ith, from: which he never deviated. Greeley combined in hiimw|f the earnestness of conviction and quickness of comprehension of Bay­ mond, with the easeleas activity and daring courage of Bennett, excelling both in the genius that molded Ids faultless .sentences, in the heart which beat in warm sympathy with every human, woe, ana in tlie moral bravery that strack for Hie loftiest aims, in utter disregard of per­ sonal results. Thus the three journal­ ists complemented each other, and together they presented to the world a triumvirate than which no country on earth was ever blessed with a greater, or capable of achieving more -lasting results." Elephants hi a Qniclnaide On the banks of the river Ganges sajs a military journalist* there are many quicksands, and during our expe­ dition a somewhat distressing happened. An elephant incautiously came within the vortex of one first one foot sank, then another and in endeavoring to extricate himself mat­ ters became worse at last no portion of either of Iiia legs were visible, and the bystanders had given np the ani­ mal as lost. Being, fortunately unusu­ ally powerful, he three several times, with what appeared almost superna­ tural strength, drew a foot from the closely-clinging earth, and placing it where, by sounding with his trunk, he found tbe 'most solidity. Not until after three attempts did the ground bear his pressure, when he* gradually released 'himself. During the whole period of his troubles his cries were exceedingly dolorous, and might have been heard for two miles. His grunt, when they were at an end, was equally indicative of satisfaction. The internal application of a bottle of strong spirits soon dissipated trembling and restored his equanimity. Many unfortunate elephants are lost in these treacherous sands, when large quanti­ ties of grass or branches of trees are not at hand to form an available sup­ port for them. After a certain time the poor beast becomes powerless, and the owner can only look with sorrow at the gradual disappearance of his noble ani­ mal, and lament the pecuniary loss he thereby suffers, for all human aid ia futile. They have been known to be twelve hours in sinking. Xeral Uses ef Beans. Not to have baked beans on Sunday is still, in some parts of New England a fracture of the twelfth commandment.
