(Bill OB Digest of the Annual Message of President McKinley to the Con gress of the United States. LARGELY A REVIEW OF THE RECENT WAR. The President lias Only Words of Praise for Those Who Brought the War to a Succensf ul Conclusion, aud Looks For ward Coiilicntly to the Conclusion of an Honorable Treaty of Peace with Spain. Washington, Dec. S. President Mc Kin Ivy's second annual message, sub mitted to congress, contains about 20, 000 words. Following is a brief synop sis inchidiii"; some direct excerpts of the more important features of the message: TO THE 

SENATE AND HOUSE OP KKPUICSENATIVKS: Nothwlthstandlng the ail'Je burdens rendered necessary by the war, our people rejoice in a very sat isfactory and steadily-Increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded. Manu factures have been productive, agricul tural pursuits have yieiued abundant re turns, labor in all iields of industry is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present congress has in creased the treasury's receipts to the amount estimated bv Its authors: the finances of the government have been suc cessfully administered and Its credit ad vanced to the first rank: while its cur rency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit, and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every sec tion 01 tne country. 

CONTKOVKRSY WITH SPAIN RE VIEWED. In reviewing the controversy which led tip to the war with Spain, the president takes up the thread or narrative where it terminated in his last annual mes sage, lie concluded: "it was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of re form to which she had become irrevoca bly committed. It became evident, however, that the proposed plans were barren of gofld re sults. No tangible relief was afforded the reooneemrados, among whom the rate of mortality frightfully increased; the proffered expedient of zones of cultiva tion proved illusory, and it was apparent that nothing save the physical exhaus tion of Spalii or the Cubans and the prac tical ruin of the island of Cuba could re sult Irom the struggle then in progress. 

DESTRUCTION' OP THE MAINE. At this critical juncture the destruo- Tlon ot the battleship ' Maine occurred. Concerning it the president savs: "It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense u.stinguishing our national character that this shocking blow, falling upon a generous people, al ready deeply touched by preceding events in t:uuu, out not move tnem to an in stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition ol danger and disorder at our doors that made possille such a deed, by whomso ever wrought." Resuming the war narrative, the presi dent directs attention to the measures, Including the $50,tJO,w0 appropriation for luitional defense, taken to place the country on a war footing, and adds: "It is sutlicient to say that the outbreak of war, when it did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict. " 

APPREHENSION BY EUROPEAN POWERS. Reference is made to the apprehension ot coming utruo by trie continental pow ers, voiced in the address to the presi dent through their ambassadors and en voys, and to the president's renlv thereto Still animated, however, by the hope of a peaceful solution of the dillleulty, and obeying the dictate's of duty, tue presi dent relaxed no effort to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne gotiations with the Madrid government proved futile, so far as practical results were concerned, ana tnen il was tne president presented the ouestlon to con- press, spying: "In the name of humanity, in the name of civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests, which give us the right and duty to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop.'' THE 

DECLARATION OF CONCRKSS. The result of this statement of the case was tne adoption of the memorable joint resolution by congress, declaring the pur pose of the I'ni'ted States to intervene between the Spaniards and Cuban, fol lowing swiftly upon the enactment of the resolution, came the soverenee of diplo matic relations between the two coun tries, the proclamation of a blockade of Cuban ports, the call Tor volunteers, and the formal declaration of the existence of a state of war. All other governments were immediately notified of the exist ence of war and each proclaimed neu trality. "It is not among the least grati fying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and difficult circumstances." THE PREPARATION FOR WAR. The president reviews at length the work of preparation for war, referring particularly to the enlistment of the vol unteers, to the material increase of the navy in both men ami ships, and to the precautionary measures taken for the protection of the seaboard coast and cities. "The aggregate number of mines placed was 1,535, at the principal harbors from Maine to California." Referring to "the difficult and im portant character" of the work per formed by the' signal corps the president says: "This service was invaluable to the executive in directing the operations of the army and navy. With a total force of over 1,800, the loss was by disease, in camp and held, officers and men included, only live." ' As to the authorized loan of $2rtO,000,000, which was taken entirely by small bid ders, the president says: "This was a most encouraging and significant result, showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the people to uphold their country's honor." Takimr im chronoiocrh-all v the events of the war. the president, reviews them care- luily. The hrst encounter was Ihe shell ing of Mrttanzas on April 27. This was followed by an engagement which was "Destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime v.nrfare." 

DEWEY'S WONDERFUL VICTORY. This was Commodore Dewey's wonder ful victory at Manila, on May 1. "The ef fect of this remarkable victory" says the president, "upon the spirit of our people and upon the fortunes of the war was in stant. A prestige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms, which continued throughout the struggle." The president says that. "Only reluc . tance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented the early storming and capture of the city (Manila), and therewith the absolute military occupan cy of the whole group." Following the memorable trip of the battleship Oregon from San Francisco to Key West, and the tiombaidment of Pan Juan and the forts of Santiago, to which special reference la made, the president says: 

LI3UT. HOBSON S EXPLOIT. "The next act In the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen, but the world, by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided bv seven volunteers, blocked the outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the collier Merrimae In the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap ing with their lives as by a miracle, but falling Into the hands of the Spaniards. It Is a most gratifying Incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of he roes was cordially appreciated by the Spanish admiral." THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN. The campaign of Santiago, resulting In the Investment and capture of that city, is referred to as a brilliant achieve ment. A brief review is then presented of the decisive naval combat of the war on July 3, resulting In the complete de struction of Admiral Crevera's Meet. Con cerning it the president says: "Where all bo conspicuously distinguished them selves, from the commanders to the gun ners, and the unnamed heroes In the boiler rooms, each and all contributing towards the achievement of this astound ing victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel In the completeness of the event, and the mar velous disproportion of casualties, it would be Invidious to single out any one tor special honor." 

PRAISE FOR OUR SHIPBUILDERS. . In this connection the president says: Nor can we be unmindful of the achieve ments of our builders, mechanics and ar 'tisans for their part In the construction pf our warships. ... TEARS FOR THE DEAD. As to the success gained by the arms Of the United States in Cuba, the presi dent gays that the earnest and lasting :. gratitude of the nation Is unsparingly due. "Not should we alone remember the gallantry of the living, the dead claim our tears, and our losses by battle, and disease must cloud tiny exultation at the irmit aijd tach us th awful cost of war. uWrl rightful the cause or signal the 

CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR. ! The total mannltlo In L-UIkI wounded in the army during the war with Spain were: Officers killed, 23: en listed men killed, 237; total. 2S0; officers wounded. 113; enlisted men wounded, 1 4M; total 1.577.

'It will be observed that whilf our no w was engaged in two great battles and In numerous perilous undertakings in block can2 bombardment, and more than "f of our troops were transported to muus, ana were engaged in as sault and siege and battle and manv Skirmishes in iinfamtlinr tAiArv io8i m, 1,0111 arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed and wounded : and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun, or a flag, or a transport, or a ship. wltn tne exception of the crew of the Merrimae" not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner." TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT GO. The president bears testimony and pays fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de votion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered to the post ot greatest exposure, fortunate ly were not required outside of the United States." They did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. The president then says: "In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us, and His safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment, and offers humble prayer for the continuance of His favors." THE 

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. The peace negotlatons, which followed soon after the capitulation of Santiago, and the preparation and signing of the protocol, are discussed at length. Refer ring to the work of the peace commis sioners at Paris, the president savs: "These negotiations have made hopeful progress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite treaty before the senate, with a review of the steps leading to its signature." 

GOVERNMENT OF OUR NEW POS SESSIONS. "I do not discuss at this time the gov ernment or tenure of the new possesions which will come to us as a result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime, and until the congress has legislated other wise, it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation, and to give to the people security In life and property and encouragement under a just and benefi cent rule. THE FUTURE OF CUBA. "As soon as we are In possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for them selves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success. It is im portant that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commer cial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encouraire the industrv of the people, and assist them to form a government which shall be free tml in dependent, thus realizing the best aspira tions or tne tuoan people. A HUMANE GOVERNMENT. "Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent and humane govern ment, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all international obligations, and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, and pro mote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither re venge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued. FRIENDLY' WITH ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD. The president says that with one ex ception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the United States with the great family of nations during the past year has been marked with cordiali ty. Concerning negotiations with the Ar gentine government, initiated with a view to removing differences in cable rate charges imposed upon messages passing from and to the United States, the presi dent expresses ins sincere hope lor an in ternational agreement whereby inter change of messages over connecting lines mav he regulated on a fair basis of uni formity, aud adds: "It would be strange were the nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization, which owes so much of its progress to the an nihilation of time by the electrical force. demands that this all-important means of communication be a heritage of all peo ples, to be administered and regulated m their common behalf." A 

QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. As to the killing and wounding of strik ing miners in Luzerne county. Pa., which aroused the solicitude ot the Austro-Hun garian government, many of the miners being subjects of that government, the president expects to reach a haruoniou understanding on the subject with Au stria-Hungary. The hope is expressed that the restric tions imposed by Belgium on the Irauor tation of American cattie will at an early day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amcr lean cattle under proper regulations. THE 

NICARAGUA CANAL. The president expects that the Nicara gua canal commission will shortly be able to report finally. "I have not hesitated to express my convictions," says the pres ident, "that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control ot an inter oceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of the status quo until the canal commission shall have reported and the United Stales congress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon tne whole matter." The president regards, in view of our newly-acquired interests in the Pacific ocean, the construction of such a mari time highway as now more than ever in dispensable. 

EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Concerning the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese empire, the president says that our position among nations gives the equitable claim to con sideration and friendly treatment in this regard, and that it will be his aim to subserve our large interests in the orient by all means appropriate to th e constant policy of our government. Reference is made to several claims of citizens of the United States pending against other nations and to the settle ment of other claims during the past y"ar' THE 

PARIS EXPOSITION. After reviewing the work of the Paris exposition commissioner, the president recommends that the appropriation for the exhibit of the United States at the Paris exposition be increased to $1,009,- ooo. OUR RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRIT A1N. Our relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly footing, and the president says it would give him especial satisfaction if he should be au thorized to communicate to congress a favorable conclusion of the pending nego tiations with Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. The president reports that the Hawaiian commission has fulfilled its mission, and that its report will be laid before congress at an early day. "It was believed that their recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to the magni tude of responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to the relationship of these mid-Pacific lands to our home un ion as will benefit both In the highest de greee." THE 

CZAR'S PEACE PROPOSAL. Referring to the proposal of the czar of Russia for a general reduction o the great military establishments, the presi dent says: "His majesty was at once In formed of the cordial sympathy involved In his exalted proposal, and of the readi ness of the United States to take part In the conference." The president says that the newly-accredited envoy of the United States to the Ottoman porte carries Instructions looking to the disposal of matters in con troversy with Turkey for a number of years. 

FINANCIAL AFFAIRS. Alluding to the financial affairs of the country, the president says In part: "The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, ISPS, including 104,751,223 received from sale of Pacific railroads, amounted to t405.32t.335, and Us expenditures to 43, 468.5S2. "It Is estimated upon the basis of pres ent revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30, 1899, will be $577,874,645, and its expendi tures $SS3,S74,647, resulting In a deficiency Of $112,000,000. "In my judgment, the present condition of the treasury amply justifies the im mediate enactment of the legislation rec ommended one year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed In a trust fund, from which green backs should be redeemd upon presenta tion, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. It Is not to be Inferred that other legis lation relating to our currency Is not re quired; on tht contrary, there oh v'oua demand toe a." 

COMMUNICATION WITH ACQUIRED The president says that in view of the recent acciuisltinn of territory bv the United States, there should be established regular and frequent steamship communi cation, under the American flag, with the newiy-acquired islands. THE YELLOW FEVER PROBLEM. In view. also, of the increased imDor- tance of the proposed formation of a commission of sanitary experts to inves-; ugaie tne yellow lever problem, owing to the military occupation of Cuba, the president recommends that congress pro-, vide for such a commission. i 

INCREASED REGULAR ARMY. I The recommendation made bv the see-' retary of war for the increase of the reg ular military establishment has the presi dent's unqualified approval. He says that it is his purpose to muster out the entire volunteer army as soon as congress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment. He recommends the erec tion of a building for the department of justice, and suggests also the advisability oi maxing suitaDie provision lor tne su prem court. SECRETARY LONG'S RECOMMENDA TIONS APPROVED. He earnestly approves of the recommen dations of Secretary Long as to the in crease of the navy, and recommends also that the grades of admiral and vice-admiral be temporarily revived, to be filled by officers who have especially distin guished themeselves in the war with Spain. The president earnestly urges early leg islation for the taking of the twelfth census, and legislation providing for the education of the 30.0W white children in the Indian territory.

Dr. Morris Leftwieh, for ten years superintendent of the Masonic or phans' home of Missouri, at St. Louis, succumbed to cancer of the stomach. The transport Victor arrived in New York from ports on the south coast of Cuba. She brought n number of American officers and invalided sol diers. Hon. Dennis Kenyon died at his country home near McLean, 111. He was stricken with paralysis two years ago, and had been an invalid ever since. St. Louis politicians explain their frequent visits to Jefferson City by stating that they are desirous of in specting the new passenger depot, recently- erected there. Papers at Bilbao, Spain, report the discovery there of .190 rifles carefully secreted underground. A number of Carlists have been arrested on charges of being connected therewith. Greater New York was at the mer cy of a storm. Sunday, whose severity was greater than that of a week ago. A terrific wind was central about that city, combined with a snowstorm. Col. William Jennings Bryan of the Third Nebraska regiment returned to Savannah, Ga., Sunday, after a 30 days sick leave. He was met at the depot by his regiment and escorted to the camp. The officers of the Merritt & Chap man Wrecking Co., who have been working on the Spanish warships sunk at Santiago, express the opinion that the Christobal Colon can not be saved. Bowed down with grief and incon solable over the death of her husband, some days ago, Mrs. Carrie Andrae placed a revolver to her breast at her home in Jefferson City, Mo., and killed herself. A bloody fight took place at Jack son, Ky., between C. C. Kunyon, mar shal of Jackson county, and Alfred Allen, a well-known character, in which both participants were killed almost instantly. Madrid dispatches from Hoilo say that the siege is still maintained by the rebels, who have their guns trained on the city and make nightly attacks. The Dons are reported as de fending Uie city spiritedly. The coroner's jury at Carlinville, 111., held that Noble Kent came to his death by gunshot wounds inflicted by his brother, William Kent.

One of the most disastrous fires ever witnessed there occurred at Marion, 111., destroying over $20,000 worth of property in less than an hour. The Goodall house, a large three-story brick, was burned and with it went most of the hotel furni ture, a clothing store, saloon and bar ber shop. Set-tarlanlom. Thirty years ago there was held in this city a representative gathering to consider "the indifference of the mul titude to the claims of the Gos pel" and "the inroads of an in fidel philosophy." Thirty years ago the responsibility was duly placed, but the people are now coming to see, as fast as prejudice will allow, that the grand moving cause of the unchurching of the people is a sala ried sectarianism, which for a century has had a comfortable time in this land. Dr. De Costa, Episcopalian, New York City. Bqual Harden for Man I insist that society's safeguard lies in forcing, by public opinion, the bur denden of weight equally upon the shoulders of the capable man as upon the capable woman. In the spirit of that Jesus whose teachings a vast por tion of mankind honors, I plead for charity, for forgiveness and tender helpfulness to the woman who errs. I sincerely hope that the moral blind ness of society will be so heroically treated it will soon be cared. Br. Henry Frank? Methodist. Nw York city. CHAPLAINS IN THE NAVY. The Roafhdt Seanai Respects Ilia Sblp'a "Sky Pilot" Hi grift Mas on Hoard Ship. The man-o'-war's man means no dis respect when he refers to his ship's chaplain as the "sky pilot." Bather it U a term of approval. The bluejacket at heart is perhaps the least sacrile gious of uniformed men. Profane he may be; the bluejacket's profanity is as much a habit as his attendance at the mess table, and it is innocuous and meaningless. But nine out of ten Ameri can man-o'-war's men have a con temptuous word, and not infrequently n hard fist, for the man-o'-war chaw" (generally the ship's fool), who invites suppression and a black eye by speaking sneeringly of religion. One of the first regulations of the United States navy recommends, in ef fect, that "officers and men shall when ever possible participate in the worship of Almighty God" aboard the ships. While this regulation is not mandatory, being simply inserted in the form of a recommendation, officers and men are much more sincere in their respect for the observance of this clause, which is read out on the quarter deck at every monthly muster, together with a short abstract of the navy regulations, than if attendance on religious services aboard ship were compulsory, as it is in several of the w-orld's navies. While there are chaplains in the United States navy who are favorites among the men, just as there are commanders of ships for whom the men w;ould fight better than for others, all of the "sky pilots" pain and hold the respect and confidence of the enlisted men. Capt. Chidwick, of the Maine, was not- seeond even to the gallant, cool-headed Capt. Sigsbee in the affection in which he was held by the crew of the doomed battleship. Memorial services have been held in churches of all denominations through out the United States in honor of the men who passed with the Maine, and there have been many requiem masses In the Roman Catholic churches for the repose of the souls of the men who went down in the battleship. But high mass ashore and high mass afloat are two dif ferent matters. The writer happened to be present at the only high mass of the Roman Catholic church that was ever celebrated on an American man-of-war. There are two Roman Catholic chap lains in the Unite! States navy, and each of them recites the low mass of his creed aboard his vessel every Sunday morning, as well as on the holy days of obligation. These masses are in gen eral pretty well attended by the enlist ed men of all manners of religious be lief, and the officers not infrequently attend the masses in a body. But it was on the United States cruiser Baltimore, when that fine vessel was anchored in the harbor of Honolulu in January, 1S96, that, the first high mass in the his tory of the American navy was chanted. The Baltimore, on her way from China to the United States, with her "homeward-bound" pennant streaming 200 feet in her wake, steamed into a ter rible typhoon a few days after leaving the coast of Japan, and, hove to and wallowing in the thick of it for eight days, came near foundering. When she rounded Pearl Harbor point, on the Island of Oahu, and crawled to her an chorage in the harbor of Honolulu she was a pretty rusty looking craft, with her cutters stove in, her davits twisted and torn off, her chain rails carried away, and her fighting tops lowered to the deck to prevent- excessive roll ing. Officers and men were glad to get into port, for their danger had been most imminent. Two seamen had been carried away by green seas that washed the high-standing top-gallant fo'c'sle, and there were a lot of broken heads, ribs, legs and arms among the men for ward. The shin's carpenter, a warrant officer, died of his injuries the day the Baltimore steamed into Honolulu har bor, and was buried in the beautiful Nuuanu valley of Honolulu, under the shadow of the Punchbowl, with naval honors. The chaplain of the Baltimore was e young Roman Catholic priest, a scholar, an athlete, and a finished man generally, born and educated in Maryland. He de cided to have a high mass as a special ceremony of thanksgiving on the Sun day following the Baltimore's easting her mudhook in the harbor of Honolu lu. This was as impressive a religious ceremony- as any ever seen or heard in a great cathedral. It was celebrated on the ship's wide and long berth-deck for ward. The carpenter's gang built an altar especially for the occasion. Some of the men got shore liberty and gath ered the gorgeous wild flowers that bloom in the woodlands around Hono lulu. Then they decorated the altar, which, when its ornamentation was tompleted, was a wonderful blaze o1 color. Two young apprentice boys served as acolytes, habited in cassock and surplices. The fact that- these two chubby boys strove to be consistent and emulative ruffians under the ordinary conditions of man-o'-war life did not , militate, in the minds of the uniformed worshipers, against the impressiveness of the mass which they served. Nor did the rattling of the double irons of th? half-dozen prisoners, confined up for ward in the "brig," in full view of the congregation, have any disconcerting effect. Nearly all the officers and men ol the ship's company of four hundred and odd crowded down the berth deck lad ders to attend the mass. The mess benches of the men were the seats. The officers were in their full dress uni forms and the men woretheir muster tag clothes. N. Y. Post. Salty Tante of Sea AVnter. Sea water is brackish, first, because the sea contains mines of salt at the bottom of its bed; second, the water is impregnated with bituminous matter which is brackish, and, third, it con tains many putrid substances of a brackish nature. The reason why rain water is not salty, although most of it is evaporated from the sea, is explained by the fact that salt will not evaporate, and therefore when sea water is turned into vapor its salt is left behind.
