The War Department at Wash ington is being exorcised upon the subject of drill, discipline and tac tics. The Adjutant General of the United States has, through his in spectors, procured a number of reports of militia drill and evolu tions in quite a number of the Northern and Eastern States, but, with the exception of Alabama, he seems to be satisfied that the Southern States arc sufficiently ac quainted with militrry movements to enable thom to place themselves upon a war standing on a very short notice, and does not deem it necessary to send out the Govern ment drill officers so far South. But in the States of Maine, Mich igan, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Ken tucky, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Illi nois, Vermont, Massachusetts, In diana, Rhode Island, Kansas, Con necticut and Dakota, it is impor tant that the militia must be in readiness on the shortest notice to join with the regular army of the United States in the formation of the largest army that circum stances could demand. The Ad jutant General, we suppose, has not altogether forgotten the little circumstance that occurred some twenty five years ago, that was the cause of the Southern States hast ily throwing together bodies of men, who claimed to be soldiers, and really did do some fighting, and he no doubt very highly ap preciates Southern feeling upon the subject of military movements, and that in the event of a war that all the Southern States would readily send forth a few battalions ot men, who, with the assistance of the United States army oilieers in command, would be able to hold unimportant posts, while the more exposed places could be held by the reliable old Federals. We are half inclined to believe that our magnanimous Government at Washington is very well satisfied with the military progress among the Southern people during the last quarter of a century, and that it would be requiring too much of them to have them put to the trouble of meeting in encampments for inspection by the United States drill officers. We think under all the circumstances that our Gov ernment is in no great haste to instruct the people of the South in this branch of national service or any of the arts of war. The Opening of Congress. Our Washington correspondent says if superstition were as preva lent to-day as it was in the dark ages, when it was generally believ ed that coming events could jiya'' very great measure be foretold by changes in the. moon, or the action of tliecJetnents, it is probable that - ent session of Congress would be looked upon as an evil omen, and an indication that the session would be an unusually turbulent one. i Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, however, the galleries 'of both the Senate and House of! ' Representatives could not have ' 'jeel1 more crowded had the day been fair and bright. Ihere is a large class of people in Washington who seem to consider it to be their religious duty to go to the Capitol on the opening day of the session, and to them it makes but little dif ference how inclement the weather, or how dull and stupid the proceed ings. Aside from the usual formal ities incident to the opening day of the session, the usual hand-shakings and pleasant greetings, and the usual good natured contest during the distribution of scats, the open ing day of the session was marked by no incident of special interest. Ham West, being intoxicated, was arrested and locked up in Lul ing, Texas, jail the other evening. During the night some one broke open the jail door and stole the sleeping prisoner's money and watch. West was found all right in the morning, but he severely blames the town authorities for the poor protection they furnish their prisoners. The New York Daily Commercial Bulletin, of Dec. 3, estimates the November fire loss in the United Stales and Canada at $10,000,000, which is an increase of one-third upon the November average since the Boston fire of 1872.

A4vfccs from Copenhagen report that Mr. Peavy, a civil engineer in the American navy, who, during the past summer, was exploring the inland ice of Greenland, pene trated 130 English miles into the interior. He was accompanied by Margaard, a Dane. They were out three weeks sledging in the ice fields all the time. Says the editor of the Wilkes county, Ark., Whetstone: "This has beeu a year of calamities.

Diamonds iu Kentucky. Evansville, Ind., Dec. 6. There is much excitement at Paducah Ky., over the report that a diamond field exists near there. The streets of the city, it is said, are paved with what is known as conglomer ate gravel, which is composed of a coarse gravel with an iron solution and carbons which is found in a moist condition, but when exposed to the air hardens and forms a solid, compact mass. This wasoh- tained from a bed comprising eight acres near the city, completely isolated, the land surrounding this spot being ordinary farming land. A short time ago an amateur gcolo gist from New York was going over' this field, and, noticing peculiar geological surroundings, began looking for carbons. He gathered several large pebbles, which, ho claimed, were diamonds in the rough, and forwarded them to the State geologist of Pennsylvania for examination. That gentleman re plied that the sample submitted to him was similar to the deposits found in the great diamond fields of Australia and Africa, and also that he had discovered microscopic particles of diamonds and garnets, but, in order to give the subject more study, he had forwarded the gravel to the Smithsonian Institu tion for closer analysis.

Washington, Dec. 11, 1886. Congress, in less than a week from its re-opening, has settled down to the serious consideration of business. The reassembling of both the Senate and House were accompanied by scenes customary on such occasions. There were the usual crowds of spectators in the galleries who looked down upon the same tumultuous disordoly crowd on the floor of the House, all talking at once and at the top of j their voices, and upon the quiet, slow moving men on the floor of the Senate Chamber, who began the new session with as little flurry as on any day of the old one. There were the usual hand-shakings, and exchange of grcetings,and flower be-decked desks, the Demo cratic side being the most favored florally, which caused some Repub- icans to remark that the change of flowers showed the change of the Administration. To the victors be long.thc flowers. Representatives S. S. Cox and Abrain Hewitt were the lions of opening day. When they entered ti,e jIa arm m arnl they were ffreete(i . ft roun(i 0f applause. Mr. Hewitt received congratulations upon his election to the Mayoralty, and expressions of regret upon his retirement from Congress. Those who had served in former Con gresses with Mr. Cox gathered round him cordially, and those who did not know him sought introductions. Representative Saycrs of Texas, who occupied last session the seat so long used by Mr. Cox, gracefully surrendered it to its former occu pant and took the one vacated by Mr. Pulitzer. Mr. C'ox has already added tobis record by introducing a bill to pre vent representatives from receiving o two salaries at the same time. He thus manifests his intention to de- OlinetheUongressional salary which MB praising you; if your left, your has accrued since Mr. Pulitzer's res-j friends are raking you over the' ignation. Republican papers glee- coals. fully distorted a recent statement ; Returning to the house for a mo to make it appear that Mr. Cox had : mcnt aftcr liaving once slartc j out) applied for and was trying to get will bring bad luck unless you sit two salaries one as minister to Constantinople, and one as Con- gressraan. As a matter of fact, he inquired of the Comptroller of the 1 Treasury as to the exact money due him under the law so that be could act intelligently concerning it - I Comptroller Durham told him he was entitled to back pay since Mr. Pulitzer resigned, and this bill just introduced shows what, Mr. Cox intended at the time to do about it. While the President's message I takes one all over Europe, to the 15 35 Samoan Islands, Siberia, the Span ..ash Antilles, to Mexico, over South America, and into Canada and Alaska, the five topics which excite the strongest interest here are the Tariff, tbe currency, the labor qncs - tion, civil service, and District of Columbia affairs. The tariff re- formers arc all pleased and some of them are enthusiastic The pro tectionists say the message is con servative enough for them, the 1 ultra silver men make complaints as was expected, and the Republi cans criticize the document as a whole, and from force of habit. Some of the more sluggish mcm- j hers of Congress predict that little aoi io viu. i, j ,i,;tu ot, i, , , , . . yond the passage of the Appropria- 27 00 ! tion bills. Others equally wise say ! there is more chance for work dur--4 00; inga short than a longsossion, and they expect to be very active from now until the fourth of March. In fact, there is little temptation to J demagoguism, and talking for votes now, anct tliere is no reason wny this congress should not do more in January and February than in all the previous months of its life, The members are all cither eloctcd or defeated for the Fiftieth Con - gress, and mere partisan maneuvers will not affect them. Then by the committee work liaving been done last session bills arc ready for ac tion, and legislation is in excellent position to be pushed to comple tion. Congressman Anderson of Kansas comes back this winter a pronounc ed enemy of railroads, and gives a description of how public men are created and owned in his section by Jay Gould's purse. Gould is trying to control the legislatures and the representatives in Congress from the states through which his roads pass. Mr. Anderson says in his own district not less than one hundred thousand dollars were distributed to defeat him. He es timates that the Missouri Pacific Railroad alone spent $2,000,000 in attempting to send the friends of ; railroads to Congress from the State of Kansas. Mr. Anderson was formerly a straight out republican, but he renounces his old faith and calls himself a member of the new Republican party, having been re elected as an anti-monopoly Inde pendent. Two years ago Republican proph ets were positive the country would go to ruin in consequence of a restoration of the Democrats to power. Now they are compelled to see a steady and general return of industrial and commercial pros perity. The facts and figures of all the Government reports show this result, and indicate a largely in creased volume of business through out the country. There is nothing so convincing as truth, but the enemies of the Administration say: "It is Cleveland's luck." Alleged Signs of Luck. Philadelphia North American: Dream of eggs, money. Dream of snake, sign of enemies. If you sing before breakfast,you'll cry before supper. Dreaming of muddy or rushing; waters brings trouble. Finding a horseshoe or a four leaved clover brings good luck. If you cut your nails or sneeze on Saturday you do it "for evil." She who takes the last stitch at a quilting will be the first to marry. If you cannot make up a hand some bed, your husband will have a homely nose. If you spill the salt some one will be "mad" with you, unless you put some in the fire. Stub your right toe, you arc go ing where you are wanted; your left, where you are not wanted. If the rooster crows on the fence, the weather will be fair; if on the doorstep, he will bring you com pany. If the first Sunday in the month is unpleasant, there will be but one pleasant Sunday during the month. If your right ear burns, someone down. When in dropping a fork it ; strikes the floor and stands upright, j it will bring a gentleman.visitor; if! 1 a knife, a lady. While at the washboard, if tlie ; suds splash and wet tbe clothes you 1 ire wearing, you will have a i ; drunken husband. If you drop your dishcloth, you j will have company; also if you j sweep a black mark or if two chairs ! stand accidently back to back. If a baby sees his face in the glass it will be death to him; if his nails arc cut he will be a thief; if , he tumbles out of bed it will save his being a fool. Break a mirror, sign of death. i Death is also foretold by a dog ; howling under a window, hearing a mourning dove, a strange dove : hovering about, or dreaming of a wimc norse. If you see the new moon through we glass, you will nave sorrow as long as it lasts. If you see it full in the face, you'll have a fall; over toe left shoulder, bad luck; over the right, good luck.
