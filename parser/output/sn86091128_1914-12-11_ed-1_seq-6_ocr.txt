RAILROADS ARE BIG LOSERS Authorized Statement by President Sproule of Southern Pacific as to Commerce Changes—Foreign Trade Depends on War. San Francisco.—Competition be tween the transcontinental railroads and the steamship companies using the Panama canal has become so keen, and its results are making themselves felt in such far-reaching fashion that President William Sproule of the Southern Pacific company, in an au thorized interview here, said: "The commerce of the Pacific coast Is in the throes of a transportation crisis. "It was assumed in advance that the steamship lines would reach out suc cessfully for bulk cargoes and imper ishable foodstuffs, such as grain, on ions, potatoes and unrefined sugar, but within the week one of the big gest companies has announced that it Is in the market for fruit and vege tables, hitherto shipped by rail in re frigerated cars. This commerce has been one of the most valuable reve nue producers the railways have had. "The tonnage from California to the Atlantic seaboard," said President Sproule, "by sea and rail combined, ; In August, September and October of ! 1913 was 120,000. Of this the rail roads got 67,000 tons, or 56 per cent, and the sea carriers got 53,000 tons, or 44 per cent. "For the same period in 1914 the I

Of this the , railroads got 67,000 tons, or 39 per 1 cent, and the sea carriers got 103,000, j or 61 per cent." The increased total ] President Sproule attributed to bet ter crops. "Thus, the sea carriers' proportion ate takings of the total tonnage from California for these three months," he continued, "increased 17 per cent, while the percentage of tonnage by rail decreased to the same extent" As to what will become of the saving made by water transportation he said: "The eastern buyer will absorb the reduction in cost of carriage. It is not likely that new manufactures will be stimulated because of our higher wage scale and higher standard of in dividual living. On the contrary, this market is likely to be crowded with the production of eastern manufac turers. "With respect to our foreign trade, the effect of the canal can not be de termined until the European war ends." it

CONGRESS IS INVESTIGATING Executive Favors Fullest Query of Military Conditions by Congres sional Committees—Internation al Impressions to Be Heeded. Washington, De 8.—Preparedness of the United States for war seems destined for investigation in this ses sion of congerss. Several bills and resolutions bearing on the subject were introduced and an inquiry by congressional committees is regarded at the capitol as certain, although the president told Representative Gard ner laBt Monday that he opposed the latter's plan for an investigation bv a national security commission. The president expressed the opinion that this would be an unwise way of handling "a question which might cre ate very unfavorable international im pressions." Senator Lodge introduced in the sen ate a resolution similar to the Gard ner measure pending in the house. New Revolution in Mexico.

BEAUTIFUL GIRL BLACKMAILER. Under Arrest at Chicago for Trying to Get $50.000. Chicago.—Miss Jessie E. Cope, ac cuser of Colonel Charles Alexander, a Providence, R. I., millionaire, author of poetical effusions, under the white slave act, was arretsed here Saturday charged with attempting to bribe gov ernment officials in Chicago to aid her to blackmail Alexander out of $50,000. Alexander, 65 years old, and married, was arrested at Providence Saturday. The public had its first view of the woman when she was arraigned be fore U. S. Commissioner Mason, who held her on thd bribery charge and also as a witness against Alexander. She is 32 years old and a brunette, described by one of the government agents who resisted the bribe as a "brilliant brunette beauty," She is of medium height and weight, and as she appeared in court was handsomely gowned. Bench and bar, it was said, have been clamoring for a year or more for a more careful consideration of mo tives behind complaints under the Mann act to discourage use of the law by unscrupulous women for black mailing purposes. District Attorney Clyne is quoted as attaching great importance to this case because of the beauty of Miss Cope, her reputed social prominence in California, where Alexander is al leged to have met her and the wealth and prominence of the man in the I case.

OUR NATIONAL BODY MEETS FOR THIRD TIME DURING THE SIXTY-THIRD SESSION. TRY TO ADJOURN BY MARCH 4 While Democratic Members Favor That Date Many Republicans Think Extra Session Likely Through Spring and Summer. Washington, Dec. 7.—At noon Mon day convened the third session of the sixty-third congress, for which mem bers of both houses flocked to Wash ington, ending their holiday recess of six weeks. Democratic leaders in Informal con ference before the opening of the ses sion, which is destined to be devoted chiefly to appropriation measures, have been unanimous in expressing the hope that the legislative program of necessities could be concluded by March 4 next, when the present con gress automatically will end. Many republican leaders, however, have stated that there were many im portant measures which they would urge for passage, and some indicated that supply bills might be delayed to such an extent that an extra session next spring and summer would be necessary. Administration leaders awaited eag erly the annual message of President Wilson, delivered in joint session on Tuesday, for a definite outline of the President's wishes for legislation.
