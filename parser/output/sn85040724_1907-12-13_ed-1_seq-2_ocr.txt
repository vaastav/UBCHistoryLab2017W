Love knows no law, unless we except the luotlier-in-law. Tlie smaller the bribe the greater seems to be the disgrace. A girl’s first love affair is apt to de velop into an epidemic. Was Lot’s wife the lirst woman who wasn’t worth her salt? Life is a game of chance in which the cards tire often stacked. Perhaps Justice is blindfolded because she so often gets a black eye. Many aman who lias made bis mark has a wife who makes him toe it. It isn’t until a girl gives up all hope of getting a man that she becomes in tellectual. The fool believes that the world is laughing with him, when it is really laughing at him. You can’t make some women realize that a husband in the band is worth two in a breach of promise suit. Whiskers. Whiskers, which are today objects of derision, were in the past held in al most reverent esteem. Indeed, in some countries, they are still held in almost reverent esteem. The following are some queer whisker facts: The young Roman made a religious ceremony of his lirst shave, preceding it with prayer, and following it with a sumptuous feast, almsgiving, and a dance. Nero sealed the first down sinned from his chin in a gold box set with pearls, and consecrated the stuff to .Inpit?r Capitolinas. Willium the Conqueror punishc 1 rebel lions Srixons by compelling them • o shave off their beards. Many Saxons, rather thatS endure such an humiliation, aban doned all they possessed and fled the ci#nntry. The Catti. an ancient German tribe, would not allow a youth to shave till he had slain an enemy. In the middle age men gilded their beards as a sign of mourning. Tlie Duke of Lorraine walked in the funeral procession of Charles the Rash with his beard covered with gold leaf. It is tin act of courtesy in Turkey for a host to sprinkle scent over the beards of bis guests. Peter the Great levied a large tax on beards. The kings of Persia in the past knotted their beards with gold thread and but toned them with square gold buttons. Miners Paid Big Sum.

SWEDEN MOURNS HER DERD KING NATION 10WED IN GRIEF WHEN OS CAR SUCCUMBS AND NEW RULER ASCENDS. WAS MOST BELOVED MONARCH Prince Gustave a Strong-Minded Young Man Upon Whom All Factions in Kingdom Will Unite. NO FUNERAL PREPARATIONS YET. STOCKHOLM, Dec. 9.—Oscar 11.. King of Sweden, died at 9:10 o’clock Sunday morning. The death of the ven erable monarch occurred in the royal apartment of the palace, where, sur rounded by the members of his family, including the aged Queen Sophia and the crown prince, Oscar Gustav, and high ministers of state, the inevitable end had been awaited, while outside the palace great crowds stood with bowed heads and tearful eyes long after the announcement came of the death of their well loved sovereign. The whole country is bowed with grief. When the tiag on the palace was dipped to half mast there was a moan of anguish from the assembled multitude any many cried, "Our dear old King is dead.” Son Becomes King in Fact. The succession to the throne of Swe den has already passed to Oscar Gustav Adolphe, duke of Vermland, the oldest son of the late King. At a meeting of the council of state the new King took the oath of allegiance under the title of Gustav V. and adopted the motto. “With the People for the Fatherland.” The princes then took the oath of al legiance and the new monarch accepted the homage of the state officials. The last hours of the expiring mon arch were passed in unconsciousness and Up to the end he gave no sign of recog nizing those about him. The Queen was grief-stricken because he could not bid her farewell. In the palace courtyard in the dim cold gray mist stood a crowd of school boys, King Oscar’s most devoted friends. Here they had stood for hours, blue and shivering, watching the palace flagstaff. There also gathered many old men and women in rags, whom, the King had al ways stopped to comfort with mild words and generous alms when he met them in the parks or streets, their faces tear stained because their beloved King and benefactor was dying. Flag Falls as King Dies. Suddenly the flag dropped to half mast and a wail of misery and sorrow arose. f NEW KING OF SWEDEN. The old folk clasped their hands and prayed and wept aloud and the school boys' lamentations were pitiful to hear. In a room near the death chamber the first marshal of the court read to the cabinet a draft of the new King's procla mation to the Swedish people. One by one the ships in the harbor and the buildings throughout the city displayed the flag at half mast, and the people soon crowded the streets and open places near the palace, but all spoke in whispers, bearing witness to the kind liness of him who bad departed and to the love they bore him. In the death chamber knelt the heart broken Queen, and gathered about her were her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, praying for strength to bear their affliction. The church bells began to toll and the minute guns boomed. All Sweden mourned its loss. SWEDEN’S NEW KING. Prince Gustavus and His View's of Gov ernment and His Life. Crown Prince Gustavus of Sweden dif fered from his father. King Oscar, in pos sessing little or no taste for literature or for science. Instead of being a theorist and a dreamer, he is essentially a man of ac tion, all the romance that he may have In herited having been stamped out of his na ture when he was forced as a young man to break off the engagement which he had made to marry the daughter of a Swedish country pastor with whom he had become Infatuated, and to wed, not for love, but merely for state and dynastic reasons, the by no means attractive daughter of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden. The crown princess shares with her mother-in-law, the Queen of Sweden, the disadvantage of being subject to hypo chondria. More or less imaginary ailments have ended by impairing not alone her physical condition, hut likewise her mind, and for years she has been accustomed to spend ten months of every twelve either In the south of France or in Egypt, her hus band, her children and the people of her adopted country seeing her but seldom. In fact, it is no exaggeration to assert that she is almost a stranger to them. Gustavus a Big Fellow. Gustavus is as tall as his father, though somewhat less broad and stalwart. That is to say, he stands considerably over six feet and would possess an imposing pres ence were It not for the shortness of his sight, which forces him to wear glasses, the latter naturally detracting from his military appearance. But for this he would present a striking resemblance to his great grandfather. the famous French Marshal

CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 9.—Ernest Ruehl, 23 years old, 3751 Lake avenue, was fined S2OO and costs by Municipal Judge Sadler for contributing to the debauch of Eva Roundtree, IS years old. Ralph Lamme, 21 years old. 4316 Calumet avenue, was al lowed to go on the payment of 85 and costs. James E. Gleason, another man who was with the girl during the “celebration," was not punished, as he took her to Milwaukee and married her, Ruehl and Gleason took the girl to a flat in Thirty-third street, according to the testimony. Next day they went to Milwau kee. where the wedding took place. Lamme was arrested while with the girl Friday, but he had nothing to do with the Milwau kee episode. Eva Roundtree Gleason testified that she knew nothing from the time she was drink ing in a south side saloon until she awoke in the flat next morning. Lusitania’s Trip Rough. NEW YORK. Dec. 9. —Showing every evi dence of terrific pounding at sea, the Lusi tania docked at 3:4b o’clock Sunday after noon. more than two days late. She had been heavily batteM-d by waves and one comber hit her wlrti amazing force. TUe wave deafed the steel sheathing- around the captain's quarters for twenty feet. The &reat ship tossed so much almost every - ody aboard became seasick. [ Bernadette, whose father was the peasant [ mayor of a little French village in the i neighborhood of Pan, the cottage where the | founder of the present reigning dynasty of Sweden was horn being still shown to tour ! ists In the south of France. | In addition to being short-sighted. Gus tavus suffers from that curious physical defect known as barred teeth, which sut>- * ject him at time to perfect martyrdom, and he is constantly In the hands of the most eminent dentists in Europe. Indeed, of all the royal patients of the late Dr. Thomas Evans, the Crown Prince of Swe den was the one who stood in the most frequent and constant need of his services. Great Admirer of Kaiser. Gustavus is on terms of the most inti mate friendship with Emperor William. The latter has no more enthusiastic ad mirer than the prince, who, in the heliet probably that imitation is the most sln | cere form of flattery, has adopted many of his German cousin’s traits and charac teristics. He, too. believes, like the Kai ser, that The mailed fist is preferable to the velvet glove in solving difficulties, and some years ago he availed himself of the opportunity of some public meeting at Stockholm openly to express his opinion that the only way of putting an end to the quarrel between Norway and Sweden was by force, and added that he asked nothing better than to be intrusted with the com mand of the* Swedish army for the task | of reducing his father’s rebellious and dis loyal subjects in Norway to entire submis sion. As soon as the tenor of tills ex traordinary speech became known at <’hris tiania the Storthing, or national legisla ture. which happened to be in session at the time, immediately passed by an almost unanimous vote a measure suspending until further notice the payment of the Norwe i gian money of the civil list of the crown | prince, the Norwegians taking the ground i that it was ridiculous to subscribe to the j maintenance of a prince who publicly ex pressed the wish to lead a Swedish 'army of invasion into Norway. Much pressure was brought upon the crown prince, even by his father, to re tract his remarks, or at any rate in some way to smooth them over. Has Support of His People. Gustavus is the first of his line to enjoy the support and the consideration of the Swedish aristocracy. The latter is among the proudest, most influential and exclusive in Europe, but made a point of holding ■ aloof from King Oscar ami his three predc j censors on account of the peasant blood In their veins and of their plebeian origin. They cannot forget that Marshal Berna dette. the first King of the ; resent line, owed his rise in lift* to the revolution, that he had taken part in the massacres of the French aristocracy and royal family, and that at Jtis death the words “Death to the tyrants and to the aristocrats” were found tatooed on his. arm. for which reason he had always refused to allow his physicians to bleed him. Gustavus is regarded as having to a great extent eliminated the peasant strain of blood from his veins, and can rely upon the support of the entire Swedish people. New Queen of Sweden. Victoria, as the consort of Gustavus, is as well fitted as her husband to play the j part of u ruler. She had many advantages |of education, being the favorite grand daughter of the Empress Augusta, wife of I Kaiser Wilhelm I. of Germany. The Grand j Duchess of Baden, Victoria’s mother, was ! tlie daughter of Augusta. Victoria is thus i the cousin of the present ruler of Ger j many. j The new Queen of Sweden is a talented i woman, being an admirable musician, an artist and a writer. It was early seen by j her parents that Victoria was to he a prin | cess of high attainments and her education I was planned with the view of developing her talents to the full. The practical side I of a woman’s education, however, was not \ overlooked. Following the example set by King Edward and Queen Alexandra with their daughters, the Grand Duke and Duch ess of Baden saw to it that their daughter received a thoroughly practical training. She was taught how to sew and darn, how i to make butter and how to man i ago a house. She was also taught to cook, and for cookery she displayed a natural aptitude which made her a past master at the culinary art. She has always retained a fondness for cooking, and even yet exer -1 vises her skill in tills direction. Asa girl she used frequently to indulge her taste for cooking, and would often make dainty dishes for Kaiser Wilhelm’s breakfast, as well as supplying the cakes for afternoon coffee. Pair Have Thiee Children, All Boys. The marriage of Gustavus took place on j September UO. 1881. Three sons were born to Gustavus and Victoria. Prince Gustav ! us Adolf, the present crown prince, was : horn November 11. 1882, being given me i title of the Duke of Scania. The other two sons of the new King and Queen are Prince i Wilhelm, Duke of Sodermanlaud. horn June 17. 1884, and Prince Erik. Duke of I Vestmanland, horn April 20, 1889. 'BIG

C., Dec. 9 [Special.]—The United States supreme court ruled today that a slate railway commission cannot force a railroad com pany to stop its fast trains at small sta tions. when those trains are engaged in interstate business. This decision, which is important, as it may affect many rulings of the Wis consin railway commission in similar ac tions. was in the case of the Atlantic Coast Line company vs. the Board of Railroad Commissioners of South Caro lina. Small Town Wanted Service. The suit arose in connection with an effort on the part of the citizens of Latta, S. C., to secure the stopping on being flagged of two such trains which daily pass through the town, and the commission ordered that stops should be made whenever the signal should be hoisted. The railroad company resist ed the ruling as unreasonable and as an interference with interstate commerce.
