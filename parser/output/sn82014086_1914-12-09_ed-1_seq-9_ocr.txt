Washington, Dec. 8. President Wll- j son in his annual address to congress today, gave bis answer to those, who contend the United States is unpre- j pared far national defense. "Let there be no misconception,' he said. "The country Has been misin formed. We have not been neglient of national defense. We are not un mindful of the great responsibility restinjr upon us. We shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new circumstance; and what is needed will be adequately done Assembled in joint session in the hall of the House, senators and repre sentative beard the Vi?t his address in person from the clerks desk. The text of the message fol lows: . Gentlemen of tho Congress: The session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session of the Sixtv-third Confess, a Congress, t venture to say, which will Ions be remembered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal response to tne thought and needs of the country. I should like in this address to review the notable record and try to make ad equate assessment of R; but no doubt wo stand too near the work that has teen done and are ourselves too mucn part of it to play the part of historians toward it. Moreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past. While a a have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whole age have been altered . by war. What we have done for our own land and our own people we did with the beat that was in us. whether of character or of intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and a confidence In the principles upon which we were acting which sustained us at every step of the difficult under taking; but it is done. It has passed from our hands. It is now an estab lished part of the legislation of the country. Its usefulness. Us effects will disclose themselves in experience. What chiefly strikes us now, as we look about us durins these closing days of a year which will be -forever memorable in the history of the world, is that we face new tasks, have been facing them these six months, must face them In the months to come, -face them without partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten everything but a common duty and the fact that we are repre sentatives of a great people whose thought is not of us but of what America owes to herself and to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amased and anxious. War Interrupts Trade and Production. .War has interrupted the means of trade not only but also the processes of production. In Europe it is de stroying men and reseources wholesale end upon a scale unprecedented and appalling. There is reason . to fear that the time is near, if it be not al ready at hand, when several of the countries of Kurope will find it difficult tn eo for their people what they have hitherto been always easily able to do, many essential and fundamental uiiiyj. At any rate, they will need our help and our manifold services as They have never needed them before; and we should be ready, more fit and ready than weBave ever been. It ia of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually sup plied with innumerable articles of man ufacture and commerce of which they are in constant need and without which their economic development halts and stands still can now get wnly a small part of what they formerly imported and eagerly look to us to supply their all but empty markets. This is par ticularly true of our own neighbors, the States, great and small, of Central and South America. Their lines of trade have hitherto run chiefly athwart the seas, not to our ports but to the ports of Great Britain and of the older continent of Europe. I do not stop to inquire why, or to make any com ment on probable causes. What in terests us just now Is not the explana tion but tho fact, and our duty and op portunity in the presence of It. . Here are markets wnicn we must supply, ana we must find the means of action. The United States, this great people for whom we speak and act, should be ready, as never befc-e, to serve itself and to serve mankind; ready with Its resources, its energies its ; forces of production, and Its means of distribu tion. It is a very practical matter, a. mat ter of ways and means. We have the resources, but are we fully ready to use them? And, if we can make ready what wa have, have we the' means at hand to distribute it? We are. not fully ready; neither have we the means of distribution. We are 'willing, but we are not. fully able, we have the wish to serve and to serve greatly, generously: but we are not prepared es we should be. We are not ready to mobilize cur resources at once.

' To speak plainly, we bav grossly erred in the -way in wljich we have; stunted and hindered the development! of our merchant marine. An now, when we need ships, we have not got them.; We have year after year debated, with out end or conclusion, the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the orea and forests and water power of our national domain la tit rich States of the West, when we should have acted: and they are still locked up. The key-is still turned upon them, : the door shut fast at which thousands' of vigorous men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water power of our navtsaWe streams outside the national domain also, even in the eastern states, wnere we nave worked and planned for generations, is still not used as it might be, because we will and we won't; because the laws we have made do not Intelligently balance encouragement against re straint. We withhold by regulation. I have come to ask you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omis sions, even at this short session ef a Congress which would certainly seem to have done all the work that could reasonably be expected of it. The time and the circumstances are extra ordinary, and. so must our efforts be also. Two Great Measures. Fortunately, two great measures. finely conceived, the one to unlock, with proper safeguards, the resources of the national domain, 'the other to encourage the use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the generation of power. - have already passed the House of Representatives and are ready for immediate consid eration and action by the Senate. With the deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. In them both we turn our backs upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine pol icy or use ana conservation, in tne best sense of those words. We owe the one measure not only to the people of that great western country for whose free and systematic develop ment, as it seems to me, our legisla tion has done so little, but also to .the people of the Nation as a whole; and we as clearly owe the other in ful fillment of our repeated promises that the water power- of the eauntryshould m lact as wen as in name be put at the disposal of great industries which can make economical and profitable use of it, the rights of the public being adequately guarded the while, and monopoly m the use prevented. To hare begun such measures and not completed them would indeed mar the record or this great Congress very seri ously. I hope and eorrfVlently believe that taey will be completed. Philippines Bill, And there is another exeat piece of legislation which awaits and should re ceive the sanction of the Senate: I mean the bill which gives a larger measure ef self-government to the people of the Philippines. How better, in this time of anxious questioning and perplexed policy, could we show our confidence 'in the principles of liberty, as tne source as well as the expression of life, how better could we demon strate our own self-possession and steadfastness in the courses of justice ana disinterestedness than . by . thus going caimiy rorwara to ruinu our promises to a dependant people, who wlH now look more anxiously than ever to see whether we have indeed the liberality, the- unselfishness, the cour age, the faith we have boasted and nro- zesseu. i can not neueve mat tne Senate will lei this great measure of constructive Justice await the action of another Congress. Its passage would nooiy crown the record or these two years or memorable labor. But I think that you will arree with me that this does not complete the toll of our duty. How are we to carry our goods to the empty markets of which I have spoken it we have not the ships? wow are we to buna up great trade (f we have not the certain and con stant means of transportation upon which all profitable and useful com. merce depends? And hcV are we to get the ships if we wait for the trade to develop without them? To correct the many mistakes by which we have discouraged and all but destroyed the merchant marine of the country, to retrace the steps by which we have, it seems almost deliberately, with drawn cw flag from the seas, except where, here and there,. ship of war is bidden carry it or some wandering yacht displays it, would take a long time and involve many detailed items of legislation, and the trade which we ought immediately to handle would disappear or lino Channels while we debated tne items, Shipping Bill. The case is not unlike that which Silver-mounted Crystal offered a four differ 2.00 at. each ...... . . . . . confronted us when our own continent was to be opened up to settlement an 4 Industry, and we seeded long lines of railway, extended means of transpor tation prepared beforehand, it develop-1 ment was not to lag- intolerably and wait Interminably. We lavishly sub sidised the building of transconti nental railroads. We look back upon that with regret now. because the sub sidies led to many scandals of which w are ashamed; but we know that the railroads had to be built, and if we had it to do over again we should of course build them, but in another way. Therefore I propose another way or providing tne means or transporta tion, which- roust precede, not tardily follow, tho development of 'our trade with our neighbor states or America. It may ' seem a reversal of the natural order of things, but it Is true, that the routes of trade , must be actually opened by many ships and regular sailings and moderate charges before streams' ef merchandise will How freely and -profitably through them. '-Hence the pending shipping bUL dls cussed at the last session but as yet passed by -neither House. m my judg ment such legislation is ' imperatively needed n -an not wisely be poet poned. . The Government must open those gates .of . trade, and open them wide; open them before it is altogether profitable to open them, or altogether reasonable to .ask 'private capital' to open them t. a venture it w not a Question of the Government monop olising the field. It should take action to make it certain that transportation at reasonable rates will lie promptly not at first profitable: and then, when the carriage has. become sufficiently profitable, to attract and engage private capital, and engage it in abundance, the Government ought to withdraw, I very earnestly hope that the Congress will be or this opinion, ana tnat Dotn Houses will adopt this exceedingly important bill. Rural Credits snd Safety at Sea. The sxeat subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and it is a matter of deep regret that the dif ficulties or the subject nave seemeu to render, it impossible to complete a bill for passage at this session. But it can not be perfected yet. and there fore there are no other constructive measures tho necessity tor which i will at this time call your attention to; but I would be negligent of a very man ifest duty were I not to call the at tention of the Senate ' to the fact that the proposed convention for safety at sea awaits its confirmation - and that the limit fixed in the convention itself for its acceptance is the last day of the present month. The conference iu which this convention . originated was called, by the United States; the representatives of the United States played a very influential part Indeed in framing the provisions of the .pro posed convention; and those provisions are in themselves for tbo most part admirable. It would hardly be con sistent with the part we have played in the whole matter to let it drop and go by the board as if forgotten and neglected. It was ratified in May last by the German Government and in August by the Parliament of Great Britain. It marks a most hopeful and decided advance in international civ- illzatlon. We should show our earnest j good faith in a great matter by adding our own acceptance of it. Alaskan Coast Line. There is another matter of which I most make special mention, if I am to discharge my conscience lest it should escape your attention. . It may seem a very small thing It effects a single item or appropriation. liut many human lives and many great enter prises bang upon it. It is the matter of making adequate provision for tbe survey ana charting or our coasts. . It is immediately pressing and oxigent in connection with the immense coast line of Alaska, a coast line greater than that of the United States themselves. though it is also very important in deed with regard to the older : coast of the continent. We can not use our great' Alaskan domain, ships will not ply thither, if those coasts and their many hidden dangers are not thorough ly surveyed and charted. The work is incomplete at almost every point. Ships and lives have been lost in threading what were supposed to be well-known main channels. We have not erovlned adecmate vessels or ad. ejuate machinery for the survey and charting. We have used old vessels that were not big enough or strong enough and which were so nearly un- eeaworthy that our inspectors would not have allowed prrvate owners to send them to sea. This Is a matter which, as I have said. seem3 small. but is in reality very great. Its im portance has only to be looked into to be appreciated. . Economy in Government Expenditures. Before I close may I eay a few words upon two topics, much dis- cussea out or ioors, upon -which it is highly important that our judgments should be clear, definite, and steadfast? tjne or. these is economy in Kovern- ment expenditures. The duty of econ omy Is not debatable. It ia manifest and imperative. In the appropriations e pass w are spendinar the monev of the great people whose servants we are not our own we are . trustees and responsible stewards in the spend ing, xne oniy tnmg debatable and upon which we should be careful to make our thought and puroose clear is tbe kind of economy demanded o us, assert with the greatest confi dence that the people of the United States are not jealous of the amount their Government costs If thev are stiri that they get what they need and desire for the outlay, that the money is being pcti ior oojects or wnich they ap prove, and that it is beinsr annlierl with good business sense and management. jovermnents arrow, mecemea.1. tmtH in their tasks and In the-means bv m--a inose tasKS are to be performed, and very few Governments are onran. izea, i venture to say, as wise and ex perienced business men would organize tUfem it they had a clean sheet of r to write upon. Certainly the Tnment of the- United" States Is not. i tninK tnat it is generally agreed that there should be a systematic re. organization and reassembling of its parts fo as to secure greater efficiency ana enect considerable savings In ex pensF. ruc me amount or money m m tnat way would, oelievo, though no doubt considerable in iteelf. running, it may be. into millions, be relatively small, small, I mean, In proportion to the total necessary out lays -of tho Government. It would be tnoroug-niy worthy effecting, as every saving would, great or small. Our duty is not altered by the scale of the saving. But my point la that the people of the United States do not wisn to curtail ths activities' of this Government; they wish, rather, to en large them; and with every enlarge ment, with the mere growth, indeed, or tne country itself, there must come. of course, the Inevitable Increase of expense. Tbe sort of economy we ought to practice may be effected, and ought to be effected, by a careful study tip a assessment Of tne tasKs ti be per- formed: and the money spent ought to be made to yield the best possible returns fei efficiency and achievement. And, like good stewards, we should so seeount cor every dollar of our ap proprtatlons es to make it perfectly eviaent what it was spent ror ana in wnat way it was epent. " It Is not expenditure but extrava ganew that we should fear being crlt Icized for; not paying for the legitl mate enterprises and undertakings of a great Government whose people com mand "What H should ;do, hut-adding what will benefit only a few or pouring money out for what need not have been undertaken at - all or' ruis'ht have been postponed or better and more economically conceived uu carneu out. The Nation is not niggardly; It Is very generous. It wiu chide us only if we forget tor whom we pay money out and whose money 1t is we pay. Thee are largo and general atandorua, but they are not very difficult of ap plication to particular cases. v Nations! Osfsnss. - The other topic I shall take leave to mention cnea deeper into tne pnnct pies of our national life and policy. It is ih subject of national defense. It can not be discussed without first answer Inar some vary searching -Ques tions. It Is said In soma quarters that we ars not prepar4 for war. What la-meant .by being -.prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief notice to'put nalton la the Held. nation, of men trained to arms? Of ronns wa are not ready to do that: and , we shall never -be , In time of peace so long as we retain our present political principles and Institutions. And what la It that it is suggested we should be prepared to do? .To defend ourselves agaiart attack? ; Wa have always - found means to' do that, and shall And thetn whenever it Is neces sary without calling otif people away from their' siecessary tasks to render compulsory Military service . in, timea Cf; peacsv : ' ; . - -: -. - ." - ! Allow me t -spesUcjtT;reat plain oes - and- directness ' upon this - great vallor aa to. a toy convictions with deen earnestness. I have tried to know what Asaeric Is, what her people think, what they are, what they most cherish and bold dear. I hope that soma of their finer passions are in my heart, some of tne great con ceptions and desires which gave birth to this Government and which have made the voice of this people a voice or peace and hope and liberty among the -peoples of the world, and that, speaking my own thoughts, I shall. at least in part, speak theirs also, how ever faintly and inadequately, - upon this vital mattejr. At Peace With World. Ws are at peace with all tho world No one who speaks counsel based on fat or drawn from a just ami candid interpretation of realities can say that there Is reason to fear that from any Quarter our independence or the in tegrity of our territory is threatened. Dread of the power of any nation we are Incapable of. We are not jealous of 'rivalry in the fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own lives as we will; but we mean also to let live. We are. indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet tbe possessions of none, desire the overthrow of none Our friendship can be accepted and is accepted without reservation, because it la offered ia a spirit and for a pur pose which no one need ever question or suspect. Therein lies our greatness. We are the champions of peace and of concord. And weehould be very jeal ous of this distinction which we have sought to earn. Just now we should be particularly jealous of it, because it is our dearest present hope that this, character and reputation may -presently. In God's providence, .bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been ty to .0UnSel and obtain peace In tbe vouchsafed any nation, the opportuni woria ana reconciliation and a healing settlement of many a matter that has cooled and interrupted the friendship or nations. This la the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self possession, our Influence by preserving our ancient principles of action. Never. a Large Standing Army. " From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to mil itary establishments. We never have had,, and whilo we retain our present principles and ideals we never shall have a large standing army. If asked. Are you ready to defend yourselves? we reply. Most assuredly, to the ut most; and yet we shall not turn Amer ica Into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best of their lives making soldiers of them selves. There Is another sort of en ergy. In us. It will know how to de clare 'itself and make itself effective should occasion arise. And especially when half the world is on fire we shall be careful U make our moral insur ance against the spread of the con flagration very definite and certain and adequate indeed. Citizenry Trained and to Arms. Accustomed Let us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing we can do or will do. We must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing' army, nor yet upon a reserve army, but unon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based upon our ac customed principles and practices, to provide a system by which every citi- aen who wm volunteer ior toe train ing may be made familiar with tho use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill and maneuver, and . the maintenance and sanitation of camps. We should encourage such ' training and make it a means of discipline which our young men win learn to value, it is right that we should provide it not only. out that we should make it as at tractive as possible, and so induce our young men to undergo it at such times as they can command a little freedom and can seek the physical development they need, for mere health's sake, If for nothing more. , Every means by which such things can be stimulated is legitimate, and such a method smacks of true American ideas. It Is right, too, that the National Guard of the States should' bo developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the estah. lished policy of our Government And uus, aiso, not because the time or oc casion calls for such measures, but because it should be our constant noli cy to make these provisions for our jnationai peace and safety. Reversal ef Polity, Aiore man this carries vlth It a reversal of the whole history and char acter or our polity. More than this. proposed at this time, permit me to say, would mean merely that we had lost our eetf-oossession. that we had been thrown on our balance by a war with which we have nothlns- to do. whose causes can riot touch us, whose very existence affords us ODnortunltiea of friendship and disinterested service wmcn should make us ashamed of any mougnc or nostuity or rearrul oreoara. Uon for trouble. This is assuredly the vpponunuy i or wmcn a people and a government like ours were raised up. the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody and exemplify the counsels of peace end amity and the lasting concord which is based on Jus tice and fair and generous dealing. . -' A powerful navy we have always re garded as our Proper and natural means Of defense; and ft has always been of defense that we have thought, never of asrression or of concuest. But who shall toil us new what eort of navy to build? We shall take leave to be strong noon tbe seas, in the future as In the past: and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation In that. Our ships are our natural bul warks. When will the experts tell us just wnat xin a we enouia construct and when will they be right for ten years together, if the relativ e efficiency or crart or airreresK uinoe ana uses continues to change as we nav seen It change under eup very ere to. these last few months? Not Negligent of National Defense. But I turn . away from tho subject. l - ' '( til11 General
