Doc Although the minds of European itateomon professional and ama teur havo been occupied with the crisis lu France and the election of Gravys successor the sensation to which D mark treated Eu rope moro than ft fortnight ago has not been forgotten As far as official Information noon we are practically not much wiser than we were then Bismarck to suit hla purpose lifted just a little bit of tho veil of mystery and having served his purpose let it drop Blnco Then be has preserved D Sphlnxllko silence rfhtch even the most daring assertions and boldest romanctn of enterprising journalists Uve not Umptod him to break Nevertheless jho clues irtvon by Bismarck together with an iocaslonal hint from high places havo been and other followed by the Colocno latrtte Bwspapeni owe with a poreovoranco worthy ot Pinkerton and information derived from var ous sources is now available which leaves no doubt that n plot to decclvo the Czar and BOW distrust between Germany and llussla was concocted in the highest cirelns nnd boldly curried out almost to a success which would have Involved Europe in perhaps tho bloodltat war witnessed In modern times The Comte de Paris through his recognized agent has disclaimed any connection with the plot and any knowledge of forged documents Ilot le repeated his disclaimer personally tho other day at SandrinRham whon on a visit to the Prince of Wales of whom ho Is a personal friend and relatives the Duo dAumalo and Duo de Nemours went down to Windsor on Sunday and protested their innocence Queen 1ctora The Comte de Pars has tho reputa tion of being an honorable man and many ton people are disposed to take his word that no prominent member of the Orleanlst family had anything to do with the plot or forgeries But I has happened in history not unfre quently that adherents of a cause have plotted and committed crimes much more serious than forgery on behalf ot their chief without his knowledge but in tho belief almost amounting to a certainty that I successful tho ond would accepted oa an amplo justification the mea employed This is tho explanation of the plot exposed by Bismarck t which all information at present available points to Princess Clementina Other Orlcan ists were undoubtedly concerned in it and although Ferdinand of Bulgaria was to have been the person most immediately and directly benefited the devoted adherents of the Comte de Paris Rave it their support by In trigues and money in the belief that their chief could not fall t reap substantial advan tages from the confusion into which all Europe would brvve been thrown I is l noteworthy that although such n very exalted personage a the Comto do Paris has publicly and privately denied a complicity In the plot Pcs Clementina and her son con alder It t b inconsistent with their dignity to te any notice of the matter The Princess is at Sofia looking after her v > n and trying to keep up his spirits in those depressing times Bhe la not succeeding much and the mother and son a described pining for the cayotles and civilization of Vienna The PCB went I t BpIgrfa too to sot npVreifal court at Sofia but she found such uncongenial mate rial that he ha It i understood almost abandoned the iea But she was auspiciously full of hope a month ago when the plot was apparently going on well She even caused Intimation t be conveyed to the Bulgarian Government that she would Rive her personal guarantee for the payment of Interest on a loan of a few million francs by which means it was proposed t raise the money o which Ferdinands Min ister of Finance I moro sorely in need than even the impecunious Sultan himself But the announcement i made today that the Princess baa withdrawn her promise and the prospects ot securing the longedfor loan seem as fa off as ever Scarcely a day passes now without Ferdinand feeling in some way or other that he Is in Bis marks bad books The Czar so far has done nothing directly t intimate his displeasure but doubts that tho blow will no man tat w 1 come and that It will be a heavy ono Under tho cir cumstances it is more than probable that Fer dinand and his mother have arrived at the conclusion that disclaimers would not advan nvan them much either Berlin tage at Petersburg or Derln The Busslan Gorman and Austrian news papers are still wrangling Borne Russian newspapers fear some evidences of Bismarcks tortuous policy and cannot persuade them selves that the plot was n surprise to him They point out that Ferdinand is more ot n German than an Orleanlst Prince and recall that he presented himself before tho Emperor William a the hood of Gorman princely houses before starting for Bulgaria An inspired Ber lin newspaper retorts that this i a falsehood and explains that Ferdinand appeared in Ber lin quite unexpectedly at the time referred to It happened t be the Crown Princes birthday and In the course of the ceremonies Ferdinand was presented to the Emperor I was not until three weeks later that tho Bulgarian dep utation arrived at Vienna and offered the crown to Ferdinand Another Petersburg paper the wollknown ViedomoiU has just addod variety to the con troversy by suggesting that although the Or teanlits may have had a hand In tho plot the persons who held its tangled skeins In their bands should b looked for in Vienna The Viedomotti asserts with a Rood deal of empha sic that In the Austrian capital the high places warm with the bitterest and most unscrupu lous foes of BuBsla who the VieJomoitl evi dently believes would shrink at nothing from forgery to assassination The Austrian cleri cal party it says for reasons neither unknown or disapproved of at tho Vatican are waiting > rlth feverish anxiety for a complete rupture of relations between Russia and Germany These people aro in close and constant communica tion with the German clerical party under Dr Wlodthorst and with the Orleanlsts Tho latter foot was amply proved af the time of Comte Cbambords death therefore con cludes the Viedotnosli it tho plot really existed as Bismarck says it has n good Austrian color The Cologne Gazette lost no time In replying to the VtedomoiH und it carried tho war Into tho enemys camp by reiterating that Russian officials in the highest positions wero aware of and encouraged the plot even if they wore i not directly concerned In its Inception The OtuUe darkly hints at still moro startling rev tUtlons in store but contents itself mean while asserting that there exists in St Isernc 8t Petersburg a powerful clique of dUtlagdlshod oflklals who moko it the business of their lives mno lves to foster the Czars untiGormnn prejudices and to misrepresent Germanys policy lu Eu rope Today the Cologno Oatette almost Im plores the Czar to give his consent to the au i thoritative statement respecting tho plot and I Presumably to permit the publication of the leading conspirator no matter how highly placed I Is Implied that Bismarck made Uuitlar appeal to his imperial Majesty und in some quarters tho Chancellors want of success Ik taken to prove that some of tho Czars grand pills ducal uncles and brothers a among the oul BUraarct has given no sign that he shared tat ue blit in the existence of a court partr at t 1 i Â± J Berlin so recklessly opposed to his roller and personality as to Join the Orlonnlsts In n at tempt to plunge the Fatherland Into a possibly disastrous war That such D party exists Is common talk in every European capital The Empress Augusta Is openly said to have forgotten her feud with the Crown Princesses In order to join forces against tho groat Cliancellor and among tho moro active tomato members of this unpatriotic party are mentioned the Countess Perponoher wife of the Emperors Court Mar shal the Countess Donkolmunn and the Countess Schlolnltz widow of the Into Minister of tho Imperial household whoso second hus band Is Count Wollcenstcln Frostburc now Austrian Ambassador at St Petersburg I 4s possible that wo may have some authoritative announcement from Bt t Petersburg In tho course of this week Monsieur De Soldatenkoff the Russian Coun clllor of State has just returned to the Rus sian capital from a mission on which ho was sent to Berlin t inquire further Into tho mat ter of the forged documents He has made his report and the Czar Is now considering It Meanwhile ono fact stands out clearly and that Is that the relations between Russia and Austria are becoming moro strained almost dally Russian troops are being moved about concentrated and roCnforced In thefrontierdls trlcts In such a menacing manner that Austria hns at length boon forced to take official notice ot them and to threaten counter measures Simultaneously the nuws comes now that Rus I sia is saying very pleasant things to Boumanla and that It is being some what ostentlously proclaimed in Ber lin that Prince Ferdinand Is i nothing to Germany and there is no call for Germany to move In Bulgarian matters ono way or an other so long as Russia keeps within the lines of the treaty of Berlin THE ami

Committees of tho Senate both Democratic and Republican wore hard at work today arranging tho membership of th committees Thoy hope to make such progress that tho committees can all bo announced by the ond of the week There is unusual cause for hat nt present a It Is desirable to have committees on tho Judiciary and Privileges and Elections appointed at once for the pur pose of deciding the pending cases It leaks out through the tightly closed door of the caucus room tnt the committee is having a difficult tusk I has nearly completed the more Important committees but there are so many new Senators now whose claims to dis tinction are equal that It Is I hard mut ter to assign thorn all agreeable places There are fortysoven mainline and select committees Nine of those the smaller and unimportant ones will bo given to tho Democrats leaving thirtydebt Ilven tho Republican Senators This Is ono committee for each of thorn Homo of tho committees are perfectly useless and never dream of having a meeting As a Chairman however I Senator hU the privilege of n room at the Capitol Which is his private castle The clerk of the committee who is always in the Senate ap pointed by tho Chnlrman acts as his private secretary The salary of tho clerkship Is 1 per day the larger committees being annual ones with n yearly salary and the smaller ones being mission places tie pay stopping with the adJourment Kuch Senator who Is i not Chair men of 1 committee has n private secretary Provided at SO per day during the session teach Republican Senator Is to have I Chair manship of a committee this year the private secretaries will all bo Democrats It is under crltaros wi al unrer stood that an effort will bo made at this session to dispense with some of the useless commit tees The effort will probably amount noth ing It has been made before und always failed There is ono committee in Inr Senate on civil service and retrenchment and another to examine tho several branches of the civil sorvlco There is ono on library nnd another on additional accommodations for the library of Congress There IB one on enrolled hills and another on engrossed bills Thero is ono on Revolutionary claims

Hills are already In course of preparation In both Houses looking to the taking of the eleventh census There Is a benato committee on tho revision of the laws but it never holds a meet ing because all cases on tho subject of revision ot the laws are taken care of by the Committee on the Judiciary I was reported at the Senate today that an effort will be made to make Wil liam > Chandler Chairman ot the Committee on Naval Affairs owing to tho fact thnt ho has had experience as Secretary of the Navy Don Cameron Is now Chiirman of the Naval Committee and Clmndlnr can only pot tho place through Camerons willingness to re tire and take another Chairmanship HU name comes first in tho lino of promotion to the Chairmanship of the Military Committee made vacant by Gen Logans death Gen Hnwleys name comes noxt to Camerons and it is generally understood that ho will succeed Logan as Cameron prefers to remain at tho head of tho Naval Committee Chandler must satisfy himself therefore with a more modest alignment Senator Hpooner of Wisconsin will b the Chairman of tho Committee on Claims the most arduous place on the list and no one knows definitely who will go to the head of tho Pensions
