The President's Message was read in both Ilouses of Congress yesterday. It is very long and touches upoa almost ev:ry measure thit will engage the at tention of our law-makers. It is so long that we cannot give it in full to our readers. However, we have edited it with very great care, and the message prison ted octiinsthe gist of the full document. We give in full that portion relating to Tariff, Internal Rev enue, Pensions, the Silver Question, Re oeipts and Expenditures, Reciprocity, th Force bill, and other Questions of great importance. Upon the other sub jects we give the ideas in compressed space. The message is neither able, judiia nor tate9man-like,bat is.a commonplace, clear and plain presentation of matters of importance and a partisan plea for the acta of the ReDublioan party. As we read every line from the beginning we hoped to see a scintillation of great ness somewhere in the ponderous docu ment, and hoped that in some particular he would rise above the narrowness and sectionalism of his party and show him slf worthy to be President of the whole people. But we wero not to be reward ed by our search. The further we read ; the greater was our dUappointment. His climax is a specious, uufair, hectiona ; and partisan argnment for the passage of tne Force bill. The evident malice against the South, ' in the concluding portion of the mes sage, recalls the eloquent words uttered by the lamented Henry Grady in Bos ton exactly one year ago. They are as appropriate now as they were then, and more so, because the President has added insult to injury. Mr. Grady said: seeled to John W. Thompson, tne naw Clerk. Both these gentlemen were can didates for the nomination, and it wa3 a graceful and generous act upon the part or Mr. (jtOOdwin wnicn wiu uobtsuuu be forgotten. Ho is a noble Democrat! The State rejoices witn waso upuu hrt victorv. and the people of Wake are gritefui lor the kind expressions of fel will make about thirteen columns. Thia signifies, we fear, that he is going to talk too much about things which, as Carlyle used to say, "it would be inter esting not to mention." The President of the United States, in his message to Congress, discussing the plea that the South should be left to solve the problem, asks: "Are they at work? What solution do they offer?" I shall not here protest against the par tieanry that, for the lirst time in our history in time of peace, has stampted with the great seal of our government a stigaaa upon the people of a great and loyal section, though I gratefully remember that the great dead soldier who held -the helm of State for the eight stormiest years of re construction never found need for such help &c, &c. If that eloquent tongue had not been stilled in death it would have even more ably expressed the partisany of a President who has, under gloss of states manship, repeated his insult and sought to send into history a stigma upon as brave and as honorable a people as the sun shines on. Every true Southern man mnst feel indignant when he reads this message from the man who ought to inspire the respect of men in all sec tions, and who has deliberately by rank sectionalism insulted and traduced the people of more than a third of the Union. But there remains this pleasant re flection: The people in every State, ex cept eight, have in thunder tones, repu diated Harrison's administration. He has heard the fatal : "Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting," and goaded by the repudiation which he has received, the president vents his spleen upon the people of the South. He will never have another opportunity, after this term, of thus falsifying history. The advocacy of the Force bill by the President confirms the fears which we have all along entertained. We believe that the Senate will pass the Force bil and seek to conduct another Presidec tial campaign upon war issues. They have not learned the recent awaking o the people if they believe su jh a policy will win. Sectionalism is dying out of the hearts of the people, and Mr. Harri son and his party will reap the whirlwind in 1892. Compared to that cyclone, the blow of November 4th last will be as a mild breeze. The Republican party will then go down to rise no more. - AN

He intro duced Messrs. E. E. Wiley, president of the Womens' Parsonage and Home Mis sion Society. She made a very striking and earnest address, showing that in four years the society had helped to build 201 parson ages, and is helping to keep the preacher comfortable in his frontier work. Oar watchword is "A comfortable home in every charge for the preacher." She re ferred to Bishop Keener, who, we judge from her speech, made some re marks upon the work of the society not complimentary. Editor In the course of her remarks she made this happy hit: I read something amusing in the New York Christian Advocate, where Auut Jemima was expressing her opinion about this female representation in the Northern General Conference. Said she: "In the first place it's agin nater. In h3 second place it a agin Scripture, for he Bible says that the bishop shall be the husbind of one wife, but jt nowhere says that the bishop ghall be the wife of one husband." (Laughter ) So I don't cire about that part of it; God has given woman her sphere and she is walking iD it. Rev. Dr. Bays followed and there was scarcely a dry eye in the church.

SHORT AND INTERESTING HISTORY OF COAL. AND I IRON MINING In the Vicinity of Fgypt in Chatham County--The Observations of Profes sor IIolmesWho has Recently Gone Over aud Explored the Localities. Special Cor. State Chronicle. Chapel Hill, N. 0., Nov. 24, The students in geology at the University have returned from a tour through the i c al and iron regions of Chatham coun ty under the direction of the writer. The party, traveling in hacks and on foot, went from Chapel Hill to Gulf, thence toEypt, Eadon furnace, Farra ville, Clegg copper miues, Sackville, Haywood and thence hick to Chapel Hill, traversing several different geological formations,and a region of great interest and importance as connected with min ing operations and river improvements undertaken at different times by the State and Confederate governments and by private companies. "At Gulf, under the courteous and in telliger.t guidance of Mr. Mclver, weex- ow-Democrats from Murphy to Manteo. amined the slopes and pits from wnich before, durincr and after the war, small THAT IS THE si ui u. quantities of coal were mined.

Early ia the Confederacy a large in crease in the facilities for the manufac ture of iron was found to bo necessary, and tne erection or five new furnaces was begun in this region of North Caro lina (Chatham Countv): (1) at Ore Ilil (now owned bv the N. C Steel and Iron Co ; (2) at. Gulf; (3) at the Tysor place 2 miles above Gulf ;( 1) one mile eas' of Egypt (Eudor furnace), and (5) a Backhorn on south side of Cane Fear river, six miles below Lockville. Thes furnaces were built ot massive stone walls, after an old pattern, not now in use. Three of them, the Ore Hill, Eo dor and Buckhorn furnaces were com pleted and operated during the war. The Gulf furnace, perhaps the largest of them all (GO feet high and 43 feet square at the base) was never qaite com-, pitted and is nov falling down. The Tvsor furnaci is also in rums. The Backhorn furnace was subse quently replaced by too more modern aud much superior furnace and crush I ing machinery erected by M bsrs Lob- dell & Co., of Delaware, some 18 years ago. This iatter in turn enjoyed ashore lived activity of perhaps a couple of years and has since been lying idle. Here is now to be seon some of the heaviest machinery known in the Uuited States. The Endor furnace, near Egypt, is still in a fairly good state of preservation. It was located immediately on the bank of Deep river so as to have the advan tage of river transportation of both the ore and manufactured products. In connection with the furnace there was operated a roasting furnace, for roasting the ore, machinery for erusaiug the ore, small puddling furnaces and rolling mills for fashioniug the iron product After the war this property was pur chased and remodelled by Messrs Lob dell & Co., and used for a short time, but for 15 years or more it has not been used. The Egypt coal mine was perhaps the place of greatest interest visited during the trip But few members of the party had ever entered a coai mine, or had enjoyed the pleasure of experien cing Egyptian darkuess at a depth of 500 feet under ground. And as we de scended the shaft, standing on the top of a huge water tank making the descent in less man a minute, ana with water pouting down on us some thought thi3 new experience of doubtful pleasure; and still more doubtful when, as we landed at the bottom of the shaft and started along one of the underground tunnels, the superintendent incautiously let fall the remark that there had been in past years several explosions in the mine and a number of parsons killed each time. However, all was safe now, as the mine was ventilated by a large revolving fan at the top of the shaft. The mine has had a checkered history. Some fifty years ago, coal was known to exist in this region, and the interest awakened in industrial matters as a re sult of its discovery exerted an impor tant influence in the establishment, in 1850, of the State ureoloaical snrvpv Soon after Dr. Emmons was appointed State Geologist (1851).. he examined this region and reported favorably on the urouiem oi successtul mininc oneratirma Dr. Mitchell, who had also examined this region, and who had lontr occunied a position of commanding influence in the soul of Dr. Mitchell have passed that wav he would have considered the great high chimney that marked the location t t,a min as a monument to one of North Carolina's disappointed hopes, to ives lost and to moneys eipeuuuu teainst which he advised so earnestly.
