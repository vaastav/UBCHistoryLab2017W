Mr. Fronde will pay no further attention, he £ays, to Father Burke's attacks, but will adhere to his original course of lectures. Emperor William, by the creation of twenty five new Peers, has taken the first step toward the destruction of the majority in the Upper House of the Prussian Parliament, which in the last session defeated the Reform bill intro duced by the Government. It is probable that the death of Mr. Greeley, and the consequent uncertainty as to the vote of the minority of the Electoral College, will re vive the agitation of the direct vote for Pres ident as a substitute for the present system, with greater prospects of a practical result rita-n the issue has ever had heretofore. Governor Palmer is asked, by tho Committee appointed in this State by the Centennial Com missioners, to recommend the Legislature to establish a Commission to take part, on behalf of Illinois, in the preparations for the Centen nial Celebration to be held in Philadelphia in 1876. The Liberal Presidential Electors of Maryland meet to-day to decide how their vote shall be cast, since Mr. Greeley’s death removes the can didate for whom their ballots were to have been given. Efforts, it is said, are being made to transfer tho vote of Maryland to Governor Hendricks, of Indiana. Paris gained only brief repose from the mea gre majority of 24 which passed the resolution of Minister Du Faure, for a Committee of 30 to draft a scheme for constitutional reforms. All the excitement has been rekindled, by a vote in wnich the Assembly, by a majority of 6, has censured the Administration for receiving the addresses of sympathy which have poured in upon it from the Municipal Councils, during Us recent troubles. More money was spent for Government print ing last year than in any of the preceding ten years, except 16G5, when snnnusual amount of work grew out of the war. Of the $1,802,343 spent in 1872 by the Congressional Printing Office, $322,861- went for Treasury printing, more than for any other single branch of the Government. Documents for the House of Rep resentatives cost $205,009; for the Senate, $125,641; and the orders given by Congress for public printing and binding amount to $893,190. Congressional Printer Clapp makes his annual request for greater appropriations. Although tlicj mesEago ■will ho made public to day and read in the morning newspapers to-mor row all over the country, our impatient de spatches foreshadow that it will not favor very much more redaction of taxation, as the needs of the Treasury for expenses, interest on our bonds, and payment of the debt equal the present revenue. Liberal appropriations are recommended to continue the improve ments needed to fit Washington to be the National Capital. Nothing is said of Com missioner Douglass* plan for reducing the force cf the Internal Revenue Department, and no approval expressed of the Telegraph scheme of Postmaster General Creswell. Cuban troubles are deplored; the attention of Congress directed to the condition of our Mexican border, and San Domingo seems to have been forgotten. Recognizing the baneful influences which may pe exerted upon the Presidential election by the occurrence of State elections in the October pre ceding, the New York World urges upon the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention the con sideration of the change in her State election day from October to November, making it fall upon the same day as that of the Presidential election. It argues that, if Pennsylvania should make this change, Ohio, Indiana, and Maine would be likely to follow the example; and, with changes in these four States, the local elections in the others would he of little significance. Pennsylvania has a peculiarly favorable opportunity for in augurating the change, a sufficient excuse for which could be found in the benefit that the people of that State alone would derive from the circumstance that one day, instead of two, would serve for voting purposes and their con tingent loss of time The Chicago produce markets were rather slow on Saturday. Mess pork was dull and a shade easier, at $12.25 cash or seller December, and $12.25@12.37)£ seller March. Lard was in fair demand and steady at cash; 1% @7%c seller January; and 7%@7%t seller March.

There was a quieter feeling in tho hog market, and prices were weak and lower; dosing at $3.90@4.15. Cattle and sheep mot with a moderate inquiry at about former prices. A juror, in the recent trial of Andre, in Now York, for killing his wife, which resulted in a conviction for manslaughter, publishes a card in which he attributes the impunity of murder to the peculiarities of jury-organization. In the Andre case, seven were for a verdict of murder at first, three for insanity, and two for man slaughter. The case was one in which the wife's infidelity had been clearly proved, and the juror states that all, at least one-third, of the jury held to the opinion that every man is justified in killing the adulterer or adulteress, when the dime is brought home to his own domestic circle. The conclusions from this state ment are of the broadest character. There is no rpason why the jury in the Andre case should not be regarded as an average jury. There has been no charge or intimation of corruption, and it was organized from no special class. The same influences that led one third of this jury td regard the killing of an adulterer or an adulteress as justifiable would lead a similar proportion of other juries to main tain the same belief. While particular juries might be found occasionally that would unite in the opposite opinion, the average result would be the same in ninety-nine cases out of every one hundred. We may conclude, therefore, that so long as the verdict rests with the jury, without any special law in regard to cases of adultery, that there will be no more convictions for murder in the first de gree, with capital punishment, in cases of which adultery may he regarded as the moving cause. A still greater danger, however, lies in the cir cumstance that such acquittals must bo based on the ground of *•' emotional insanity,” which opens a way of escape for murderers of all classes who arc defended by ingenious lawyers. THE 

CAUSE OF MB. GREELEY’S DEATH. Next to maligning a virtuous woman, the Chi cago Times seems to bo happiest in striking at a dead man. In an article under the above cap tion, it mentions that Mr. Greeley had been in sane from the day he received the Cincinnati nomination to the day of his death, that he was very insane when he made his October speeches, and that he became more so after the October elections. A more cruel and unjustifiable stigma could not possibly be put upon tho fame of the honored citizen for whom the whole country is now mourning. There has never been a series of speeches betraying higher ability, clearer conceptions, more logical force, conciseness, and vigor delivered in this country than those made by Mr. Greeley in his October tour. Tho letter which he wrote accepting tho Cincinnati nom ination, and tho subsequent one addressed to Senator Schurz, were models of superior thought finely expressed. Not only do they answer the charge of insanity fully, but there is no evidence that Mr. Greeley was insane at any period even of liifl illness. Delirium is frequently an accom paniment of disease, and always of the disease of winch Mr, Greeley died, viz.: inflammation of the brain. The principal cause of the disease which produced Mr. Greeley’s death wo judge to have been not personal disappointment at tho loss of the Presidency, but an overwhelming sense of responsibility for the defeat of those who bad, contrary to rule and precedent, stated their po litical fortunes upon him. There is nothing in the mere defeat of a candidate for the Presi dency to account for so sad a result. Some candidate must needs be defeated once every four years, and oftentimes there are two candi dates defeated. In tho election of 1800 there were three candidates defeated, —Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge. The unusual, and to Hr. Greeley the harrowing, circumstance in the present case was, that a large number of [Republicans, includ ing such eminent men as Sumner, Trumbull, Schurz, Banks, Blair, Julian, and others, had opposed the nominee of their own party in order to support him, and that the Democratic party had broten all its traditions and prece dents for the same end. The result of tho elec tion was well calculated to bring upon a sensitive nature tho most weighty sense of responsibility. ThosewhohnewMr.Greeleybestwillneverbelieve that his personal loss of the Presidency had any poignancy worth mentioning' alongside of the sorrow he felt for those friends who had nobly cast aside old-time prejudices in order to sup port him, or had sundered their party ties for the same purpose, believing that they could thereby best promote the well-being of tbo coun try. Mr. Greeley should have been made of sterner stuff. He should either have shielded himself hy the reflection that in all this busi ness be had acted from conscientious and pure motives (as wo firmly believe ho did), and that time would vindicate both him self and those who acted with him; or he should have wrapped himself up in the selfishness of the genuine politician, and lei each fellow look out for himself. He could do neither. Large as his brain .was. his heart THE 

CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1872. was still larger. This was one of the accusa tions of bis enemies during the campaign. The unjust, but not unnatural, chiding of some of his late Democratic supporters fell upon a defenceless head. They were the only blows that could not be parried, and, while we do not attach great importance to them as agencies in his taking off, they were well calculated to aggravate a pre-existing malady. The loss of his wife was not an unexpected event. It was known to him that she was suffering from an incurable disease. The loss of sleep which he suffered at her bedside undoubtedly came at an inopportune time, but, without that depressing event, the result to Mr. Greeley, we apprehend, would have been the same. A great and good man has gone from among us. We aro accustomed to say that he was erratic. Mr. 10111, in Ins matchless essay on Liberty, points out that nearly all the persons who have conferred great benefits upon tho human race, and who stand forth as the landmarks of human progress, have been called erratic by their contemporaries, and not a few of these erratic persons havo been martyrs to their ideas. Mr. Greeley’s place in history will probably be that of the person who contributed most to edu cate his countrymen (after he had himself been educated) to abhor Slavery, and who also con tributed most to bring the dissevered sections and factions which had their birth in Slavery to substantial accord in a newer and brighter ora. To the latter idea he has, in some sense, boon a martyr. THE GREELEY ELECTORS. On tho sfch of November, Electors of President and Vice President supported by the friends of Greeley and Brown were chosen in the States of Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Louisi ana, Kentucky, and Missouri. Under the Con stitution, the Electors thus chosen have to moot at the Capitals of their respective States on the first Wednesday in December, and cast their votes for President and Vice President. In the meantime, Mr. Greeley has died, and the ques tion naturally arises, For whom will the Electors in these States give their votes for President ? The case has not that importance which it would have if the Greeley Electors were a majority of the Electoral College. In this case they are in a minority, and it cannot affect the result of the election one way or the other how they may cast their votes. Nevertheless, there is a principle involved in this matter which oughtnofc tobe sacrificed. It has been suggested that the Electors in these States should vote for General Grant, thus mak ing the vote of the Electoral College unanimous. However desirable it might be to have this unan imity of action, and this display of good feeling, there is no more reason why the Electors ap pointed to vote for Mr. Greeley should vote for the opposing candidate than there would be, had General Grant died, in having his Electors vote for Mr, Greeley. The Electors chosen to vote for General Grant could not more flagrantly violate the trust reposed in them than by voting, under any circumstances, for Mr. Greeley. If there ho anything which they were especially commended not to do, it was to vote for Mr. Greeley. The instruc tions on the other side were equally imperative. The death of a candidate cannot transfer his votes to the opposing candidate. The Constitution has, by its provision in an analogous case, suggested the proper course.; In case of the death of General Grant after the 4th of December and before the 4th of March, Mr, Henry Wilson, who was voted on the same ticket for Tice President, would become the President. The people voted for Grant for President, and for Henry Wilson to succeed him as President in case of his death happening before his inauguration or during his term of office. Had General Grant deceased before the meeting of the Electoral College, every consideration of right, and justice, and of respect for the popular choice, would suggest that Mr. Wilson should be voted for by the Electors for President. When voted for by the people, it was the intention that ho should succeed General Grant, in the event of any disability happening to the latter, and the fact that such disability occurs before the 4th of December, instead of after it, does not change the moral responsibility of the Electors of the people. The Electors appointed to vote for Greeley and Brown have the same responsibility upon them. The duty cl the Elector is not changed merely becaueu ho Is in the minority. His responsibili ty to his constituents remains the. same. The people of his State instructed him not to vote for Grant, hut to vote for Greeley for President and Brown for Vice Presi dent, The Electors of each State arc to vote the will of their constituents, no matter whether they vote in the minority or majority. The Electors in the States mentioned were ap pointed to vote for B. Gratz Brown for Tice President, that, in the event of the election of Mr. Greeley and any disability overtaking him, Mr. Brown should succeed him. The Electors, therefore, in our judgment, have no discretion in this matter. They should vote for Mr. Brown for President. At all events, they should not vote for General Grant. A Presidential Elector is perhaps the only officer known to the law who is hound by no law, oath, pledge, or anything but his personal honor. He is designated os a candidate for an Elector by the friends of some candidate for the Presidency. When elected, he may vote for whoever ho pleases without violating any law; but in tho history of the country, from tho first election to tho present time, there is no instance of a Presidential Elector, chosen by one party, voting, under any circumstances, for tho candi date of tho other party. For this honorable fact we may assume the country is indebted to the circumstance that the Electors have been bound by no other obligation than personal honor. There have occurred all manner of betrayals, and breaches of faith in all branches of official life, even among sworn officers, but the Presi dential Electors have never, under any circum stances, failed in an honest obedience to tho will of those who elected them. The objection to having these Electors vote for General Grant rests upon the imperative necessity of maintaining the responsibility of tho Electoral College, and of preserving with unbroken uniformity the faithful execution of tho popular will by those appointed for that pur pose. Once establish the precedent for a de parture from this rule; onco admit that au Elector, appointed by the people of the State to vote for A, and not to vote for- D, may, under some circumstances, vote for B, and the long liue of honorable precedents Trill be broken, the discretion of the Elector will bo substituted for the implicit obedience to the popular will, and, this douo. the election of President will cease to be determined by the popular vote, and may in time become a matter perhaps of bargain and sale among the Electors. TO 

SEEMLY QUARRELLING. The death of Hr. Greeley, as affecting the in terests of the New York Tribune, has been made the occasion of ono or two very unseemly exhibi tions of personal rancor and business competi tion upon the part of some of the other Now York journals. The Sun, upon the very day of his death and in the body of the narrative con taining tbo details, has a personal fling against Mr. Whitelaw Eeid, the managing editor of the Tribune, accusing him of suppressing a note from Mr. Greeley, denying the authorship of an editorial article entitled (t Crumbs of Comfort, * which was printed immediately after the elec tion, although Mr. Greeley had specially re quested the publication of the explanation. In the same article, the editor of the Sun takes occasions to state that Mr, Greeley commended and indorsed the “On to Richmond ” editorial, which ema nated from, or at least was inspired by, the editor of the Swn, who, at tho time of its publication, was managing editor of tho Tribune . Neither of these facts—if they are facts—were at all perti nent to tho account of Mr, Greeley's last hours and death, and they sadly marred a narrative which, in all other respects, was a credit to jour nalism, It would have been just as appropriate to have inserted in tho narrative a political ap peal to the people, or an invective against those who opposed Mr. Greeley in tho recent canvass. The matter was wholly extraneous, and should have been eliminated from the article, as out of taste and not in keeping with tho solemnity of tho occasion. It only adds to the grav ity of the offence that the writer allowed personal animosity to control him so far as to openly exhibit to tho public an old busi ness quarrel, which hitherto had been known only in the profession, and in. every line and word to betray an animus against every person who has filled the position which ho once occu pied. It matters not whether tho strictures had any foundation or not. They wore alike un seemly and out of place, and shocking to peo ple of sensibility. Such an exhibition only has its parallel in tbo frequent quarrels of relatives over tho division of property before its owner is buried. Mr. Greeley had but just breath ed his last when this article appear ed, and it was printed at a time when it was known that Mr, Greeley’s as sociate could not answer the accusations against him which were embodied in it. It was, there fore, both ill-timed and indecorous, and meets the severest censure, not only from the friends • of Mr. Greeley, but from all who cherish a feel ing of respect for tho dead, and for tho solemni ties of such an occasion. Hardly loss unbecom ing is the conduct of tho New York Times, which, under the flippant pretext that tho friends of Mr. Greeley, meaning his editorial associates, had concealed his real condition from tho public, aims a direct blow at the business pros perity of tho Tribune, even while its editor was dying. If tho editor of thee Sun was unable to conceal his feelings in the shadow of death, tho editor of ihe Times is scarcely less able to conceal his joy that, in tho death of Mr. Greeley, the Tribune will die also, as “Mr, Greeley is the Tribune ln the whole history of journalism, wo can recall noth ing more unbecoming than these two exhibi tions of spleen. Outside of New York City, tho newspaper press of tho country, even those partisan journals which most vio lently opposed him, have put on record the kind liest expressions of sympathy, and have uttered no word which could jar upon the moumfulncss of the occasion, either directly or indirectly. The individual expressions of the public have been of the same character. It was reserved for two New York journals, which specially and boastingly appropriate to themselves precedence in metropolitan journalism, and assume to be models for others to copy, to prove that, when the opportunity offers, they are unable to rise superior to personal dislikes. We know not or care not whether the statements are true. They are unmanly and indecent. Mr. Greeley is dead, and silence befits the dead, at least until he is laid in his last resting-place. THE COMING SESSION OF CONGRESS. Congress convenes to-day. The first busi ness, after the reception of the President’s message, will be to listen to the resolutions with which members come fortified from their State Legislatures or their constituency. These will bo summarily disposed of by reference to the proper committees. There are only eighteen bills on the Speaker's table in the House,—an unusually small number, there being often as many as a hundred bills being left unacted upon at the close of a session, and thus remanded to the second session. These bills, with one or two exceptions, are of a comparatively unim portant character. Tho first in the special order of business is “An act to secure the pub lic lands to actual settlers,” and the next a bill, reported last session by General Banks from tho Committee on Foreign Affairs, to cany into effect tho provisions of the Treaty of Washing ton relating to the Canada fisheries. Tho ele ments of this bill include the declaration that the products of the fisheries of Canada and Prince Edward’s Island shall bo admitted into tho United States free of duty, as also those of Newfoundland, when the latter shall have given evidence of having conformed to the provisions of the treaty; that foreign goods destined for Canada shall be permitted to pass through our territory free of duty; and, further, giving ef fect to that portion of the treaty relating to tho navigation of tho St. Lawrence River and tho lakes. A bill for revising and amending the laws relative to the mints and coinage of the United States; a Civil Eights bill, very’ similar to Mr. Sumner’s in the Senate; and a bill for the retirement of worn and mutilated notes of the National Banks, con stitute the main features of the public bills left over from tho last session. The present session is short, expiring March 4, and it is probable that tho time up to the holiday adjournment will be occupied by the special order of business already provided. The serious work of Congress will begin after the holidays, and it is a matter for congratulation that the time will be brief for lobby-work. - It is probable that the first measure which will attract the active co-operation of the lobby will be the consideration of postal telegraphy. This measure is now virtually in the hands of tho Appropriation Committee, which had occasion, last session, to consider tho differences existing between the Government and the Western Union Telegraph Company relative to tho rates for Government messages Out of this grew the consideration of tho feasibility of connecting the telegraph lines of the country with the Postal Service. We have published the outlines of this bill, which will be reported at the coming session, not by .the Appropriation Committee itself, but by one of its members, and backed by its influence. The bill seems to be a sort of compromise be tween letting tho telegraph business of ihe coun tryalone and the absolute Governmental ab sorption of it. It creates a joint-stock corpora tion, to be known as the Postal Telegraph Com pany, with a capital stock of $20,000,000, divided into 200,000 shares of 

SIOO each. The Company may construct new linos and buy the old ones, and must establish stations at all Post Offices where the gross annual receipts amount to SSOO. There is to be a uniform charge of one cent per word for each circuit, —250 miles to constitute a circuit for distances less than 500 miles, and 500 miles to ho a circuit in messages sent for a greater distance than this, except at night, when tho circuit is to be 1,000 miles. No message can be sent for less than 25 cents, all messages to be prepaid by stamps furnished by the Post Office Department. The monopoly of the telegraph business is secured indirectly by declaring that all telegraph messages not received or de livered through tho Post Offices must have a fivo-cont stamp affixed. The Post Office Department is to retain five cents on every mes sagetaken by the Postal Telegraph Company, and pay over to the Company the remainder of the re ceipts. In addition, there are provisions for re-*'* duced rates to the press, for priority of Govern ment business, and for such regulations as will place the Company thoroughly under the con trol of the Post Office Department, besides stip ulating that the Government may buy the lines and property of the Company at any time it may choose. Of course, such a bill is open to all the objections that can he made to a direct assump tion of the telegraph business of tho country by tho Government, and to still other objections. It contemplates a co-partnership between the Government and private individuals ; it creates a gigantic corporation and monopoly; it adds to dangerous Government power still more danger ous power in tho hands of the individuals who, in company with the Government, shall control the corporation. Tho introduction of such a bill will be sufficient evidence of a powerful and well-organized lobby behind it. Among tho other features of legislation which threaten tho danger of lobby influence, if postal telegraphy shall not absorb the entire attention of Congress, ate the following; The division of the moneys received from tho British Govern ment in settlement of the Alabama claims; the application of steamship companies for subsidy, based upon the success of the Pacific Hail at ihe last session; and, perhaps, an attempt to re vive the movement for refunding the cotton tax. The latter involves the sum of $70,000,000, and any effort to take this amount out.of tho Treas ury will he too glaring a fraud to admit of suc cess. The Alabama moneys amount to $15,500,. 000, and claims will bo entered by the Govern ment for its expenses in settling the difficulty; and by private individuals and insurance com panies for tho same losses. All of these claims will be represented by their respective lobbies. “With these various schemes ahead, there is, per haps, reason to rejoice that the coming session must necessarily be a short one. Baskin has now got a now subject of personal grievance* Heia sorely troubled because the British workingman wants to go to the British Museum on Sundays. He says: “You wish to get into the Museum to recreate your minds, but are you quite sure that you have got any minds tobe recreated ? Before you expect edi fication from that long gallery full of long legged, inconceivable spiders and colossal, blotchy crabs, did yon ever think of looking with any mind of mindfulness at the only too easy conceivable short-logged spider of your own English acquaintance? or did you ever so much as consider why the crabs of Margate Sands were minded to go sideways instead of straight forward ? And what is Greek sculpture or any other sculpture to you ? Are your own legs and arms not hand some enough for you to look at but you must go and stare at chipped and smashed bits of stone in the likeness of legs and arms that ended their walks and works two thousand years ago ?” All of this is very sour and very smart, but it never seems to occur to Buskin that perhaps the British workingman hasn’t time to go hunting British spiders and crabs, but would prefer to look at those already caught. With reference to sculpture, after his not very flattering remark touching tho minds of the workingmen, we fancy ho will thoroughly appreciate the British work ingmen’s legs and arms if he is ever unfortunate enough to get near them. Just at present, while all the groat powers are at peace, there are two Utile clouds of war float ing about, which are as ludicrous as they are harmless. Tho first of these is a difficulty be tween Serria and Turkey. The town of Zoorink, on the frontier, although belonging to Sorvia, is occnpied by a Turkish garrison, the removal of which was promised as far back as 1867. The promise has never been fulfilled, and now the Servian Government has taken the matter up with great energy, and refuses to pay the tribute unless tho garrison is removed, to which the Grand Vizier has replied: “I should ho sorry to have to fetch the tribute; ” 'and there tho mat ter rests. Tho second is a struggle be tween tho Prince of Dippe-Detmold and his people. Lippe-Detmold has a Parlia ment, to which somewhat important functions are assigned, but the people won’t have anything to do with it Xu some districts no elections are held, and in others the representatives elected refuse to attend, and the Prince, therefore, when he summons his Parliament together, finds noth ing but empty benches. In despair, he recently applied to his royal cousin of Prussia for assist ance, and, in response, tho Emperor sent him an able administrator; whereupon tho Prince bids defiance to his people, and now announces that ho will govern them without any Parliament, and upon his own responsibility. Bocent advices received at Washington state that our common school system has been adopted in Sweden, Spain, Japan, and certain parts of South America. In Chili, primary schools have been organized, in which education is free and secular, which are maintained by a Primary School Society. The Municipality of Santiago also main tains primary schools which are free but unsecular. All of these schools aro grow ing in usefulness and popularity and accomplish ing a good work. These results, it is claimed, aro duo to the circulation of the re ports of our National Bureau of Education. Their circulation has had a similar effect in de termining the character of educational institu tions In Sweden and Spain. In Japan, tho Gov ernment has appropriated $2,000,000 for the es tablishment there of primary schools. The an nouncement of this important feet is in every way full of promise for the advancement of these countries. It has long been a question as to who shall de cide when doctors disagree. A still more embar rassing condition of things is found in a case where two gentlemen of distinguished position make assertions that are directly opposed, as in the case"of Cruikshank and Dickons. It will be remembered that the artist gave his authority, some time since, for the assertion that many of the most vivid scenes in “Oliver Twist” were inspired by his drawings of Fagin and Sikes, made by b' m before Mr. Dickens had written the text. Now Mr, Forster prints in the second volume of hiß “Life of Dickens” the fac simile of an autograph, letter from Mr, Dickens, sotting forth that the book was all written before he saw Mr. Cmikahank’a pictures which the latter claims to have inspired the most picturesque portions of it. It is an unfortunate disagreement, rendered the more complicated by tho acknowledged genius of both author and artist. THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

In regard to tho of Louisiana, it should he stated that Goveuor Wannoth, to whom the returns were legaly sent, was on the point of declaring the result when an order proceeded from the inferior tate Court of Judge Dibble, declaring the Canuseing Board to consist of Longstrect, and others; and an injunc tion simultaneous! proceeded from tho United States Court of Judge Durell, commanding Warmoth to dosit. Since then. T el al, have been vaniy trying tc . :cas them selves of the refcuna, without whlc.. .hey can do nothing. The aitemont telegraphed over tho country, some dap ago, that the “official can vass” [by the Lojgstraet Board] gives a Repub lican majority a 12,761, has no basis in fact, and may be taker only as indicating to what ex tent, and with That result, thoy would doctor the returns—wien they get them. The figures prepared for the official canvass to bo announced by Varmoth, ga~a the Liberal ticket 7,446 majority. ‘Warmothhag convened the Lib eral Legislator# elect, Dec. 2, and will unques tionably instal Governor McEnory and the Lib eral Government. On tho Presidential issue, tho effect of the muddle, and lia only effect, will, probably be to deprive Joniiiana of her vote altogether. —As regards tho Noith Carolina Senatorship,. the Springfield Bepiiblcan says: If it had been merely* question of getting tho best man, tho North Carolii> Liberals ought not to have? long hesitated be twee* Governor Vance and Judges Merrimon. But the prraeris a veteran in the pubhft service, is very populr personally, and his previous exclusion from the sot to which the State had elected him has been warmljurged as entitling bim now to preference over all other competitors. Bat Judga Merrimon is the pier and more progressive cC’ the two, and wool* undoubtedly cut tho more im portant figure in tb Senate. Perhaps it is worth men tioning that he is txa law partner of Mr. Phillips, the new Solicitor Genre! of the Administration. 16RESS. As the contes - in the North Carolina Xegisla- hire becomes core interesting, we give the bal lots reported t> date, premising that the vote oil Tuesday, the Sth, was in the separate bodies,, viz. s Senate-Yance, 25; Horrimon, 7; Pool,. 18. House—Vance, 53 ; Merrimon, 11; Pool. 55. Menimin, who appears not to have pressed his contest fcr the Governorship, preferring to take his choice for Senator, withdrew his few friends fron the caucus cf the Liberal majority, on the 25th that they might not be bound by its nominatioi of Vance; and, if he shall be elect* ed, it will doubtless be by Republican votes, to get him oit of the way of Governor Caldwell.

Hughes or Jamas H. Platt, Jr., for next Governor. —The Boston Advertiser (Administration) says: When the President was first elected, and great ex pectations were indulged in of what his independence and resolution would accomplish, the politicians open ly threatened that, if he tried that game, they would soon teach him where ha belonged; and it must be confessed that they kept their word. The Pennsylva nians who quitted his room the other day with clenched hands and sat teeth, formed but part of on army much, more formidable than that which was arrayed against: the President in the Wilderness. Tho lynx eyes which found in his private tastes and inclinations the means of shaking his prestige daring his first term will be upon him with renewed keenness. —The rejection, by the people of Michigan, ot the Constitutional Amendments submitted to a vote in the late election, gives point, and force to the demand for another attempt to revise the Constitution by a Convention. It is remember ed that there was a Convention in 1867, and that its work was repudiated at a special election, April 6, 1863; bnt that* Convention was entirely partisan, and, if it be possible, the next should be constituted, as in Illinois *-uud Pennsylvania, by nearly equal numbers from beth the great parties. A Legislature unanimrstijf Republi can (except five votes) will Hav® aolve this problem of Reform. —Tho Virginia papers are laughing over the absurd ignorance of the ' Buchanan County Judges, who returned the vote as though cast direct for President and Vice President. —The Floridian thinks the Legislature, from the complexion of the returns, will be close. At present the Senate stands 12 Conservatives to 10 Republicans —2 districts, the First and Thir teenth, undetermined. In the Assembly the Conservatives and Liberals have certainly elect ed 25 members out of the 53 composing that body, with a good prospect of at least one if not two more. —lt is reported that Miss Alexander, a Cali fornia actress, who has been for ten years & member of Brigham Young’s family, will be the next to tell on the lecture platform what she knows about Monnoaism.
