NOT AN ALAIIM, BUT A WAKNING rpiIQ Philadelphia fuel administrator is - not nn alarmist, and his statement, printed on this page, Is not an alarm to panic, but an ularmlngly timely warning to faco tho facts and meet tho conditions, ad mittedly grao here, Utl caution, con servation and co-opcrntlon. Mr. Lewis Is singularly fronlt In hh presentation of tho local situation, both as to Its Immedtato distress nnd Its scant pros pect ot alleviation. Ho has brushed osldo surmises nnd theories, and, as ho was asked to do by this nowspapor, tells tho truth ns It appears to lilm, out of his months ot devoted public scrdco and with tho first hand knowledge of ofTlcial experience. Ho Is singularly suggestive, too, In a con structive way ns to what must bo dono to solvo tho fuel problem. Ho glcs among tho factors undermanned mines, enormous Government requirements. Insufficient rail road colliers and a stock In tho yards hero depleted far below tho normal. Candidly, ho confesses his Inability to form out ot thcso factors a solvablo equation, tho answer to which will afford general satis faction, Mr. Lcwlq docs point tho way to a tolu tlon of mcaiurablo relief, and It Involves tho samo policy wo havo becomo familiar with In our determination to win tho war. This Is co-operation. At tho bottom of American coffco cups nftcr cery meal Is nn aggrcgato wastago of tons of sugar. Already wo havo made lmmen&o savings by putting Just enough sugar In our cups and stirring It to complcto solution. Tho samo slmplo prlnclplo applies to fuel. Tedcral authorities can rcgulato tho largo Indus trial users of coal. But householders them selves must rcgulato tho prlvato uso of coal. They must havo a conscience, a senso of sacrlflco and a cheerful acccptanco ot another war hardship. Uach little leak swells tho flood of waste. Domestic waste, tho vast extent and heavy consequences of which wo aro Just beginning to realize, must bo controlled In tho homes, by scien tific firing of furnaces, btan lardlzlng tho temperature to the healthful maximum of OS degrees, riddling nshes, tcasonablo dress ing and other obvious devices for conserv ing coal. Conservation and co-opcratlon aro not going to glvo each homo a hothouso atmos phere but they will keep tho dwellers sufficiently and cinclently warm, it tho cheerful glow of voluntary content Is kin dled In '.he spirit. POST-MORTEMS AND POST-HASTE TWO Investigations aro under way In tho Kngllsh-.spcaklng capitals of this planet. Why did Halg let hlnis,clf bo tnken by iur prlso In front of Cambral? Why did our War Department get Into a tanglo over machlno-gun manufacture from April until Juno? Thcso two Inquiries will do no gold what ever unlcbs they bubordlnato tho past to tho future. Tho question Is not "Who wa3 to blamo?" but "Can this happen again?" Wo must watch tho War Department Uko hawks and wo must watch tho critics of tho War Department llko hawks. Let us paraphraso that famous saying of Mr. llooscvilt to tho effect that "Tho man who hates a foreign country (meaning Hngland) moro than ho loves his own country doss not lovo his country." Just so. And tho man who hates Mr. Baker moro than )7o loves hlu country does not lovo his country. Tho questions that must bo answered first aro these: rirst. Is Mr. Baker equipping tho Amer ican troops In franco at this moment with sufficient guns and ammunition'" Second. Is tho manufacture and ship ment ot war material proceeding as rapidly as tho dispatch of troops to I'ranco Is pro ceeding? When thoso two questions aro nnswered wo shall havo plenty of tlmo to find out what happened la&t spring. An ounco of post-hasto Is better than a pound of post-mortems. KAISER KARL'S REBELS SUBJECTS of tho Austro Hungarian mon arch living In this country aro not re ferred to as "alien enemies" In tho presi dential proclamation. They aro allowed to do anything a citizen may lawfully do, and thcro Is good reason for this leniency. Theso Hungarians, Bohemians, Rumanians, Poles, Serbians, Czechs and Slovaks aro no moro lojal to Kaiser Karl than sheep aro to a wolf In tho fold. They would no moro cross tho ocean to fight for him than a Philadelphia Independent would cross tho street to vote for tho city gang. They have a very strong senso of nation ality, but what they mean by "nation" has been yearly shown for generations by thej furious debates In tho Parliaments at Vienna and Budapest. Sinn Pelners nro meek compared with thcso rabid racial partisans. It was an Austro-Hungarlan if a man can be called such a name who killed the Archduke, to the satisfaction of all hot blooded Serbs everywhere. Bohe mian regiments havo deserted en masso rather than fight for tho Hapsburgs. Mr. Wilson's speech calling for war on tho VIenneso vassals of Berlin Is Just what three fourths of tho people of tho dual monarchy hav e been waiting for. No man Is extravagant who makes some child happy Christmas. Moro Ico in tho Park and less In tho highball glass has put skating where it belongs. , German abuse of Mr. Wilson's mo tives Is the ilnal proof that his speech hit tho mark.

A few more discontented citizens will fire the right man from the Department of Publlo Danger One of theso days. , The Prussians' peace terms for Rus sia are only tho annexation of 100,000 Square miles or so of Russian territory.

FBIDAY, DECEMBER H, THE CONQUfcROR OF JERUSALEM Sir Edmund Allenby, Cavalry- mnn and "Good Officer," Has Had Notable Career THIS la.the psychological moment for somo genealogical eharfi to produco nn au thenticated family trco of Lieutenant Gen eral Sir Bdmund Herry Itymnn Allenby, K. C. II., lateat conqueror of Jerusalem. To lit tho romnnco of tho occasion It should dato baidc at least as far as tho crusades and should show that ono of General Allcnbv's ancestors stood beside Richard Coeur do Lion on one or both of the to occasions when that doughty but unlucky warrior monarch viewed from afar tho walls of tho rovoted city which ho was destined never to enter. Allenby Is a name with n Jformin ring to It, and It Is ponlblo that one of Sir Kd mund's forebears did actually 'squlro tho Impetuous Richard Yea-and-Nay: but tho modern conqueror li too recent a flguro In tho war limelight for any biographer to have et ilujr up such Interesting facts. For tho present General Allenby will have to bo content with the honors that be has won for himself and these seem ample, Of his nn cetrv the world known only that he Is not the descendant of a hundred belted earls, hut merely enmoa from what the Kngllsh nro given to calling a "good family" All that ho has achieved In the profeiMon of nrnn has been through hl3 own ability and by hi own efforts. As military aces go In these modern war times. General Allerby Is not a Joung officer. Horn April 21, 18C1, be bad passed the ii(to when military geniuses of history gained their greatest laurels long beforo his namo was known outside British nrmy circles As n matter of fact, probably no ono would bo moro astonished thar. Sir IMmund hlmvelf If, because of hli success In 1'alollne, tho world should now acclaim him a military genlut All ho has ever pretended to ho Is Just whit be was called nt tho Horso Guirils when tho wnr began anil a very rcbponnlble duty was thrust upon him a good ofllcer, ono who executes a task, whether caiy or difficult, with as little fuss at.d In as short a tlmo as possible "Allenby Is Dependable" Ho was a good officer when, upon leaving IIallc hury College, an excellent but unrc nowned Kngllsh second try bchool, bo entered Iho Inr.lskllllng Dragoons ns u subaltern Ha was .1 good officer, bin buperiors said, when ho served In the Ilechuanaland expedition In 188-1-83. Ho w.ih .i good enough officer to be mnilo adjutant of bis famous regiment lu 18SD, and bo goc-d ar ofllcer In tho lloer War that hp was twlco mentioned In dispatches and rewarded for his services by being inado n Companion of the Bath Liter, as com mander of the Fifth Cavalry Brigade. In 1910, bo continued to merit the trust arc! confidence of his superiors "Allenbv Is dependable" they Mid at tho Horo Guardt.. "A gucd officer." every ono agreed It Is lltllo wonder, theiefore, thnt In tho dirk hours of 19U tho llritlsh War Olllce, seeking a good officer to tako command of tho civalrv expeditionary force that fnrh'rn lmiin that was to crspplo with Von Kluck'H I'lilans turned to Hrlgsdler General Allenby. X' binall part nf tho credit that Is now freelv ulcn Britain h "contemptible llttlo arm" for tho part It played at Mons bo innred to Allenbv and his troopers. It was, lvwever, at best a losing tight, though glorious in Its gallant stubborncss, nnd tho world Is nluavs Inclined to withhold from lohers the garlands It lavishes upon thO'So who actually achieve victories. Wo know now tht General Allenby, aa commander of the Third British Army, con tinued to prove himself u good officer on the west front during 191fi. particularly In tho battle of ArraB, tint began on Kaslcr Sunday of that ear That the British' gains ir th it action wero not inrnmensurato with tho losses puTerwl w as nrnblv not hi fn'iH That was Brlth Mratesv then. But until ho was transferred to tho command of tho British forces in Fgvpt In .Tune last Allenbv 'h name wan as w holly unfamiliar as that of Bvng Itself. Cavalryman's Successes That Sir Kdmund Is a cavalrv officer by preference and by training nhnu!d orcnslon no surprlbo S'o far as tho British army is corcerned, this is a war in whlih U19 cavalry has had little to do, but In which cavalry leaders nevertheless havo won distinction Halg hlnibelf Is a cavalrjman, and bo was hla prcdece-scr, the Iet.s aggreso Viscount French Bvng, the man who bet thiiVH pop plrg at Cambral a they had not popped blnco the German Crown Prlnco sought tho glory duo a future Fmperor at Verdun, had nlwavs been In the cavalrv arm of th bcrvlco before tho big war a"d for somo time after it began. Slnco cav ilrv officers have m ido rood in tho trench t'uhtlrg In France and Flanders, bmall wonder was it that one bhoulil have 1 een uhosen for the command in rgypt, where bodies of horses could bo ued to advantage Th'iigs had rot gone well for tho British In Fgvpt In tho early div of the. war It will bo recalled how In Vovemher. 1914, a Turkish army got within btrlklng dlstanco of the Suez Canal Tho Anzacs had their hands full In defendlrg tho great waterway, but by December. I'il3. tho tide had turned and tho Turks had been driven hack as far aM FI Arlsh. elghtv-flve miles east of the canal Then followed a lull of six months; then an other Turklxh advance, which met with a decisive defeat. The British bad driver, tho Ottomans across tho border Into Palestine before Allenhv's arrival at the front, so that he found affairs In better shape, though far from running smoothly, when be took com mand Ar. advance upon Jerusalem had reached a point onlv about fifteen mtles sooth of that iltv, whllo along the coast nn otber column bad gono nu far as Gara : but there the campaign lagged until new life was infused irto It by the good officer from the western front. Since November, when he struck north, bo has taken Beersheba. then Gaza, afterward Jaffa and now Jerusalem pretty good evidence of efficiency ard cnter nrlbe. Aid for Arabian Rebels Now that General Allenby has once more proved himself a good officer by winning Jerusalem for tho British nnd for Chris tianity, the question arises. How much real Importance should be attached to bis suc cess? Trom a purely sentimental point of view the fall of the shrine of Christendom looms big. Doubtless It has much political value also; even tho German press admitted this when the capture of the city was fore cast some weeka ago. From a purely mili tary standpoint, however, the capture seems to possess no great significance. Very likely the conqueror will follow up bis success by striking eastward and cutting the railway line that unites the Moslem holy cities of Mecca and Medina w 1th the main part of the Turkish Binplro. By doing this he will have accomplished his main tasks, which were to secure the Suez Canal against attack and to glvo the Arabian rebels a chance to set up their own Government Independent of the Ottoman power. In tho minds of many persons Allenby's drive Into the Holy Land Is associated more or less dlrjectly with the progress of that other British expedition up the valley of the Tigris beyond Bagdad Tho prospect of there being any co-operation between these turn forces Is too remote to be conalderea. rrom Jerusalem to Bagdad Is more than 400 miles as tne crow nies, supposing that any crow would havo the temerity to crosn tn Syrian desert without carrying a commis sariat. Should Allenby push further along the coast It is barely possible that the Meso potamlan expedition might endeavor to strike westward and form a Junction with hloi. Even as It is. the Turks, relieved of the fear of Invasion through tho Caucasus, may yet decide to throw a far larger force Into tfyrla and Palestine than they havo hitherto had there.' To Turkish eyes Mecca and Medina are prizes worth having and keeping. In that case Allenby may be called upon to fight harder than he has fought before to retain his conquests. But his British friends and admirers multiplied many times In the last few days will remain confident that whatever further problems he may have to rnrtl he triu continue to tot. WmMlJ .a rpa 

STEALING MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT Wild Days When Public Docu ment Was Bartered to Highest Bidder ONCI3 upon a time, when thcro wcro bad, unscrupulous men In tho newspaper busl ncss and worso ones on tho, outside ready to trade with them tho President's message to Congress was nn object of barter und upon occasion represented a small king's ransom. But nothing In this world was to well ordered then as many things nro now, and It never can happen again. All bad newspaper men havo reformed. Tho honor system has cured them. So, when vou sit down to the reading of tho well-rounded periods which flash from tho Whlto Houso now, as they sel dom flashed before, jou may rest assured that tho paper In jour bands hasn't tcorcd a beat upon any of Its contemporaries. This thought may bo comforting, but It's unromantla; and there's many n tale ot tho old dais tli.it should not bo permitted to bo utterly forgotten. The Last and Biggest Killing Fifty i ears ago, or, let us bay, forty, tho stealing of tho President's message was an annual bcandal. It was n jcarly cpc6tatlon, and Newspaper Row In Washington was al ways full of sharp eyes and tingling cars on tho eve of tho first Monday of December. Anv thing was likely to break Including tho reputation of tho correbpondent who per mitted his paper to bo beaten It was nn ugly and u trjlng business, brought about not so much by tho ileslro of ono paper to beat another, although that urgo was strong, ns by tho cupidity of somo Gov ernment rmplojo having ncccs to tho printed copy and eager to acquire large Christmas money This graft upon ono occasion amounted to ns much as J1500, and that was tho labt ' big killing William C MacBrlde, tho Washington cor respondent of tho Cincinnati Fnquircr, was approached by an emplojo of the Government Printing Olllce, who bad come into pobcs slon of the printed proofa of President-elect Hayes's message Ho demanded 11 lirgo bundlo of money In exchange for his small roll of proofj) Macllrldo paid out $1500, fco tho btory gocy, and then looked about for an op portunity to svndlcato his capture und thus reduco his own expenses. Tho New York Times and tho Chicago Times rune In.

The New Yorl: Herald's Scoop Another story, very llttlo less dramatic, but having tho virtue of freedom fioni tho sordldness marking tho first, loncchis tho New York Herald This, too, took plaeo In tiio mlddln seventies tomcwheic On the Sunday evening bt foro tho opening of Concrrss It bee uno noised abroad In New Yoik tint the Herald in bomo way had be Lured mi ndv.inip mpy of tho President's message and proposed to print It in tho next das's paper Now, thero had been bo much of this bort nf thing jear utter jear, that tho newspaper publishing hid become "Jumpy," bo alt the llcrald'H esteemed ion temporaries walKid in upon that paper a edi tor and spoke their minds peevishly "We 1110 Informed," they said, "that ou havo secured .1 copy of the mess ice and mean to print It beforo the opening of Congress " Br'cr 1'ox ho dldn t bay uuflln, but lay low "Wo demand," they continued, "that iou promlso Into and now to do no such thing" Br'er Fox ho didn't b ly nullln, but 1 ly low. Whereupon tho nenoiis lonteniiuirarles htormed out of his otll o uttering wild threats. Now, tho editor of tho lleiald hadn t be cured nn advance copy of tho message at nil, but tho Juniplnesu of his iials put an Ide 1 Into his head "Thoso fclluWH," he bald to himself when they had gone, "will movo heaven and earth and points south to get that message liit their Monday Issues, to I'll havo to do that thing" Tlieri-upon ho Issued ordeis to tho compos ing room to Uear the decks nnd have un extra force of compositors In readiness to tako tho message when it eniuo over tho wire bhortlv after inldnlht, as was the custom, and rusli it Into tvpe and then on to tho presses at once. Instead of v ailing until Tuesday. Tho other papers, feeling th it tho Herald bad long had the message In tno and would thus havo them beaten from tho start, made no effort to do mora than glvo tho bare gist of tho messige Tho Heralds hand compositors, working like beavers, sue. ceeded In getting tho paper upon tho streets "at the tlmo of bparow eJilrp" with tho President's words In full. Never, never again! The Modern Method This rort of thing, liable to break out every jear, got to bu such .1 potential pro moter of nerious "piesstration" that all tho publishers of tho nation welcomed tho Gov ernment's suggestion of n plan that would mako ever) body behave. It was Just about twenty joars ago that arrangements were made with tho two largo news agencies of the country to exact of each paper getting their service a pledgo not to print tho message until .1 dispatch was re ceived from tho acencv In Washington an nouncing that tho document bad been pre sented to Congress All reputablo Journals gave this pledgo and mn has ever broken it. So, for nearly a quarter of a century tliU (sometimes) Interesting publlo document has been distributed to tho newspapers of tho country dajs beforo tho opening of Congress. This year was an exception. Tho President burned much midnight oil over tho prepara tion of the piece of real literature to which the Congress vias privileged to listen last Monday a week, and It wasn't finished until the very day of Its presentation. It camo over tho wires Into the offices of tho afternoon newspapers Just ubout the tlmo that the members of Congress were settling back in their chairs to listen to the reading of It by tho President himself.

LEWIS halrtuan uf (he l'hll idetiihla Hoard of tlto Fuel Administration THA - tint ntliraclto coal situation In Philadelphia as it is tod ly und to mako uny suggestions likely to provo helpful. It villi bo quito lm poisihlo to go Into tho whjs and wherefores uf things. I deal simply with concrete facts and leavo it to thoso who havo a liking for Luntroverhy to urguo them out. At this timo of jear thcro ought to bo Morcd In tho loaljaids of this city ubout 310,000 tons ot hard coal urplicablo to do mestic use. This, with 18,000 tons coming In dally during a normal winter, would keep tho city warm until April. On October HG thcro wore 83,000 tons In the jards, with very llttlo coming In. I havo not tho figures upon mo of the exact amount today, but am suro It is not 60,000 tons 1 do know, how ever, that coal Is coming In at tho l.ito of about SiOOO tona a day and this only with great effort. It does not rcquiro a very bright brain to tea that unless this condition e.in bo Im proved something Is going to happen. I havo for two months been devoting every partlclo of energy I possess In trying to get coal Into Philadelphia. The Government requirements aro enormous and tho transportation prob lem is almost insoluble. Tho public, which lias been persecuting railroads for tho last dozen jears, heaping upon them masses of unncces firy thaiges, absorbing their cash and un dermining their credit. Is now reaping somo of tho fiults of Its cwn fplly. Some ono will naturally nsk. What Is tho prospect of Improving conditions? I. answer with perfect frankness. I do not know. Gov ernment requlremer ts, w cather conditions, car supply, work or Idleness at the mines aro only bomo of tho unknown factors In tbo inuatlon. Nobody can glvo an answer to them. The White-Card System Vpon ono thing Philadelphia can rely, namely, that I have done, am doing and will do cverj thing In my power In every po&siblo direction to Increase tho supply, and I shall feel perfectly free to call upon tho press auu tho public for aid. Having said this much, I turn to another branch of tho subject and answer somo ques tions. Why wus tho whlte-caid system es tablished I It was established In order to cnablo the fuel administration to detcrmlno the amounts of fuel necessary, to prevent duplication of orders and to stop "shopping for coal." It Is a success. Why were the "sick ness cards" established and why were they curtailed? They wcro established to afford Immediato relief In cases of sickness. They were curtailed because too many physicians abused them. Some charged poor persons as high as 52 apiece as a feo for them. Others made no Investigation of the cases and coal was delivered on sickness orders and sold out within an hour by the bucket. Also some physicians camo to the fuel office and begged US to pay no uuenwon ii mcir cerwucaicn, which they only gave to avoid being both ered. At present physicians are required to apply In person. They come at the rate of thirty to forty a day. Some complain of this as a hardship. It Is; but It is the only way to protect the fuel administration from Im position and fraud. I am sorry to havo to say this, but It Is true. Cheaper Coal for Very Poor Why la It that the fuel administration encourages what cro known au tho "bag trade" und tho peddlers? Becauso In this way a much wider distribution of coal Is secured, especially among the poor. In the past there has, been extortion In this busi ness, but tomorrow new regulations go Into effect which will render extortion ' Impos sible. Of course, It Is an expensive way to get coal; retailing Is always more expen sive than wholesaling. But the prices fixed after a most- exhaustive Investigation by us give only a fair profit to the bagman and peddler, Drive the latter off tho streets and you produce untold suffering. Regulate him, but don't abolish him. And wo havo regulated him. Home olan ought to be put into opera tion In every city by which the very poor could obtain coal more cheaply, I have su,ch a plan for Philadelphia, and if some phllaa- A I tbiwlst wU let havo ,I10,"09 J tthkl nm'WKw 1917 ;"v -' S awV fV 

SOON VILL I TEST TOUR IN COAL CRISIS could carry It out, nnd probnblv at the end nf tho season return him bin money, or at least HO per cent of it. But at present I am t-hort one philanthropist I must now consider another phase of tbo situation the citizens of Philadelphia might as well understand now as at any other tlmo that this country Is .it war. At present they seem to have very little idea hevoud giving money and labor and tinging tho ' Star fap ingled Banner." Tho coal situation cannot materially lm provo during tho war, and for wise rea tons, Tho normal number of miners In tho anthracite coal Holds Is 180,000; It Is now 1S0.000: und to their credit bo It said tho 160,000 havo produced more coal in 1U17 than tho 180,000 did in 101C. Wo cannot hopo to Increase thla number. The Drain on the Supply Now, think of tho drain on coal. It must bo shipped abroad , It must bo used to heat tbo cantonments and for various other Gov ernment uses, (Irst of all Thero Is enough anthracite coal In thoground to last 1000 5 cars, but with labor conditions as they aro only a certain amount can bo got out of tho giouud, and If It could bo got out tho tar supply would be Insulllcicnt to handle It. What, then, Is to bo dono? Tho answer Is obvious: Conservo what we have. The other day I ordered a man to walk twe or threo blocks In West Philadelphia and examine the nshcans which wero left out for the aslhman. Tho result was Interesting. In many there was nothing but ashes. The furnaces had been properly attended to and combustion was complete In many more largo pieces of per fectly good coal were found, showing that tho householder paid no attention to his fur nace. Philadelphia has wasted, Is wasting, Its coal. Again, hotels, apartment houses, olllce build ings and private residences are overheated. Tho fuel administration nt Washington has Uxed t3 degrees uh a proper temperature, and means will have to be taken to stop this waste of fuel. I grant that In some cases of Illness or old ago a higher tempeiaturo may bo neces sary; but theso are exceptional cases and can always bo met by a gas or oil stove. People will havo to dress moro warmly. Of course, if persons in their homes persist In dressing in January in clothing suitable for July they will feel cold at a temperature of C8 ; but then there is no necessity for dress ing In any such way. Wear clothes suitable to tho season. Wartime Conservation Again we must remember that we are at war and that coal must be conserved, and I venture to predict (not officially) that If buildings this winter continue to bo ab normally heated In spite of warnings the owners may experience tome difficulty in getting a supply of coal In 1918. If this war goes on. and there seems every prospect that It will. It Is Inevitable that sham action will have tn be taken to cut off many things that are thought to be neces sities but In reality are pure luxuries. A few da) a ago coal dealers were Instructed not to sell coal for private garages, This wus thought to be very bard, A private garage is a pure luxury, and surely thou Bands of homes in Philadelphia cannot be left cold tn order to warm automobiles. My object In writing this article at the request of the KVEKiNa Public Ledoer lias been to explain the situation, to answer a number ot questions that are constantly being addressed to me and to make sugges tions as to how people can help to better conditions. I have no wish to alarm any one panto will not bring another pound of coal Into the city. Nothing Is gained by ex citement. But I do want to Impress upon my fellow citizens the gravity ot the ooal situation and to ask their help In deallrig with It. I can assure them that no stone la being left unturned by the fuel administration here. But unless the citizens themselves aro willing to aid, at least In the direction of stopping waste and getting along with as llttlo fuel as possible, the task becomes much more difficult, and It will only lead to drastlo rules and regulations which no one wants to resort to ana wincn can so easily do avoided br an exhibition oi ny an esmumon oi patriotism murjled with nattenco anaoiUlnary horse mjh. j - t J Mi LV tPSHTT jaJ - , !-" '44 -I
