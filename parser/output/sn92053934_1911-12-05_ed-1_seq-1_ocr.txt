Judge Bordwell, addressing the defendant, commented on his decla ration that he did not intend to Ho st roy life. "The circumstances are against that statement," the court said. "A man who will place 16 sticks of dybaoiite in a place where you, knew gas was burning in many places, and knew many were tolling, must have had no regard for life; must have been a murderer at heart and undeserving of clemency." JOHV J. IS 11. EXT. For reasons other than such a plea of non-intent. Judge Bordwell declared he would Impose the pen alty of Imprisonment for life. John J. McNamara came next. The Llew ellyn Iron works Indictment was read to him by the Judge. He said he had nothing to say.

Perkins Says Fines Fail to Stop Law-Breaking Firms. STRONGER ACT IS ASKED Department of Commerce Should Gnat licenses And. Control Business. ToungBtown, Ohio, Dec. B. Prison sentences for Individuals responsible, not fining of the corporations, was the plan advanced here by George W. Per kins, New York financier, as the cure for the trust eviL Mr. Perkins said the government should retain the basic idea of the Sherman law, but should strengthen Its purpose. The first step toward curbing of corporations, he said, was to augment the powers of the department of com merce and labor so as to give it full control over interstate and interna tional companies. Each concern should be forced to obtain a charter or license from the bureau, and in order to comply with this charter each concern should be forced to submit to the department reports on every de tail of its business. "The situation demands immediate relief," said Mr. Perkins, "and If con gress cannot promptly formulate a new and comprehensive program, then the president, with the consent of con gress, should at once appoint a com mission to take up the great problem that confronts us, and no further step of a nature disturbing to business should be taken by the government until that commission has made its report." DissoLtrnoir not solutioit. Mr. Perkins said that development of the last six months have made three clearer In regard to trust con- Ttarre -irs ; - :- First That dissolution is not a o- Iution, because we are after substance, not form. Second That the United States In its auest for commerce must have large business concerns. Third That the people are not afraid of the size of these concerns, but are afraid of the methods and practices pursued in the past, and de termined that these methods and prac tices shail not be pursued in the fu ture. 

CHIEF EVILS OF SYSTEM. Following are the chief evils with which the corporations are threaten ing the country, said Mr. Perkins: Overcapitalization and stock water ing of corporations. The unbridled control by a few men of huge aggregations of capital in business. Secret, unscrupulous, blind-pool methods. Unfair distribution of profits be tween capital, labor and consumer. SEEKS STRONGER LAWS. Mr. Perkins said the Sherman law must be amended to a higher order of efficiency and continued: "Personally, I believe the foMowing to be a constructive suggestion: That we retain the basic idea of the Sher man law; that we strengthen its pur pose by making clear that crime and guilt are personal and not corporate; by making the punishment fit the Crime; by making clear that men who violate statutes drawn in plain, un mistakable English are not to be fined, but imprisoned." 100 ILLINOIS DELEGATES TO WATERWAY CONGRESS Chicago, Dec. 5.
