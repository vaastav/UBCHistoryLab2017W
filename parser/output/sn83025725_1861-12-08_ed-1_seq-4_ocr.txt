The fiev. Or. Palmer bein: necesarilr absent from the city in attendance at the General As3etnby of the Presbyterian Uhurcly sitting at Augusta, hie pvupit was yesterday supplied by the Kev. ;Lr, Bice, late of Louisville, Kentucky, whence he has been compelled, on account of his hearty sympathy in our glonoti cause, to flee. He will officiate for Dr. Palmer for two or three weeks to come. Dr. Bice selected for his text, yester day morning, the striking ver?o (the loth) of the 22d chapter of Genesis, which reads as follows: KAnd Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah- Jireh, as it is said to this day: In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen." The chapter, it will be remembered, gives that touching and pathetic narrative of A bra ham's ready sacrifice of his son Isaac, in obedience to the divine command, given to try his faith. The trial over, in accor dance with the custom of that axe, the patriarch gave a name to the place of its occurrence, and that name, J ehovah-Ji- reh, signifies,' literally, "The Lord will see;" or, in effect, the Lord will see to it, and provide. . ;The preacher crave a most interesting and satisfactory exegesis of this scrip ture, which ho described as the most sig nificant and important in the sacred vol Time. The incident which it records he characterized as the first visible declara tion of the great truth that He who made the world and all it contains sustains and regulates it by His providence. It was also the earliest type given in scrip tural history of that irreat doctrine of sacrificial; substitution which prefigured the last great sacrifice on Mount Calvary. - The sermon was most eloquently de livered, as well as most logically and con vincingly conceived, and was listened 1o by a large congregation with the deepest interest. . We have chosen this discourse as the eubject of a few editorial remarks this evening, not byway of reviewing or crit icising it as a whole, but only for the purpose of referring to one suggestion which it contained, and that is just now of peculiar interest to us as a people : the zreat fact that the Maker - and Euler of all created things still "sees and pro vides" for the needs of His creatures. - The preacher, in this connection, alluded to the btrikin manifestations of Divine Providence in behalf of this nascent and struggling nation, which, from the very commencement to the present period of this war, have been so signally display ed. The finger of God has been plainly visible in the conduct and results of the struggle, on our part, and this has been frequently recognized by the Chief Mag istrate of the Confederacy, in his calls upon the people to acknowledge it, by devoting days to religious observance. N 1 -t it?- ? A. 1 ajt. race, wxuxe upon vais point, urgeu upon nis nearers tne consideration mat there oould be no such thing as a nation-? al recognition of the hand of Heaven as guiding its affairs and protecting: its interests, without personal and individu al purity of principle and purpose. Ev-; ery member of tne community snouia practically evince his belief and trusting and his gratitude to, an overruling if rov idenee, by doing to the utmost, every one his own part, the work of deserving the favor so signally manifested. This obligation involves the sacred and para mount duty of sacrificing self on the al tar of patriotism. It imposes upon every one the. duty of submitting to privation, not only of its luxuries, but even some of the necessaries of 4ife, if, by such re linquishment, the cause in which we are engaged may be benefited and advanced. This is no time for extravagant expen ditures for personal luxuries. While our soldiers are in the field, enduring all the hardships of camp-life, or meeting the common enemy, in deadly strife, or ly- g, sick, wounded, needy, ana percnance dying, in the crowded hospital, it is hardly short of criminal in as, who stay at home by our peaceful firesides, pursu ing our business and our pleasures, while these men are fighting our battles, or are suffering in consequence of having done so, to indulge in extravagant and need less waste of money. It is all very well to pretend to be grateful for the boons bestowed by a kind and favoring Provi dence, but it should be remembered that "God helps those who help themselves," and the best way to evince our gratitude for such blessings is to show that we inow how to make a proper use of them.

Sautttcru Sentiment And Feeliiijr The Richmond Examiner, in its comments on the president's Message, graphically and truly describe? the sentiments and feelings of the people of the South upon the subject of. re-union with the Yankees. Every, word in the following passage of its excellent ar ticle, gays the Petersburg. Kxpress, will be cordially enclor.e'l by every man,' woman and chili in the Confederate States, save the tories in Western. Virginia ' and Eat Ten neiwje. Let the Yankees "read, ponder, and inwardly digest" what is here written, for it sjH'aks a purpose of the South which is as fixed as fate, and that purpose is,. never to submit, to the-1 degradation of a re-union with them upon any terms. Should it. be the will of Providence to inflict upon "us a succession of ruinous defeats which would leave no hujc of accomplishing our inde pendence, wc would consent and propose to be a dependency of any foreign Power be fore we would be again in membership with the Yankee political household. .. . j Says the Examiner . '. . "The President does but echo a sentiment inerradicable in the minds of our people wheu he announces to the Congress, and through them to the civilized world, that the Reparation between us and the North is fin al, and that no efforts on their part no re sistency in their wicked endeavors-to sub jugate us will never bring us again under a common nag. Of onr ability to maintain ourselves, unaided ancT alone, we entertain no sort of doubt. We know, too, that we are "master of the situation." and that ere we are prostrated, five millions of British ope- uves will be deprived of bread, and anar chy become the doom of their country. But if our condition were indeed desperate, if our arms were not equal to the manly 're solve, to be free with which we set - out; if indeed Providence seemed to desert us and to frown on our righteous quarrel, there are yet alternatives which our people would hail with joy in preference i to living under the rule of a race so hated and infamous. Bet ter the reign of a British or French sover- eign; better uie rule or the Autocrat of Russia: be' ter any despot; any rule or any fate, than to be allied with the wretches who I are invading our soil, burning our homes, and polluting our hearths. No fate could be eo abject, no portion so bitter, as alliance with them." . .;'.., V Good, for tne Girl.
