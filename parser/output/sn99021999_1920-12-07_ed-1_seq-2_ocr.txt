' 5" Mr. Harding's address in the send k rate was v1 response to an ovation -that greeted his appearance for the opening pfcll call and was delivered u at the suggestion of Senator Lodge , of Massachusetts, the republican fj '-leader, who called attention to the i fact that for the 'fast time in history "i Ja president-elect was present as a ' $ -(senator. Vice President Marshall f-econded the suggestion byslcaving lv:his place ;and escorting Senator f, - Harding to the rostrum. T; " Affected by Courtesy.' 2 " Visibly affected by the courtesy shown him by his colleagues and by j5 -crowded galleries, the president j elect voiced deep regret at the sur- render of his association of six years, including both democrats and :i republicans in his tribute of affection-J E ' J - t Ft I i ana respect ior nis leilow senators, a ' He, termed campaign charges of a H senate oligarchy as "harmless fic- - tion," and declared' that as president i3 lie would rtgard botb senate and 3 house with high estefcm, but with-i- out a thought of any surrender of coordinate constitutional authority. "I a n pleased at this greeting by i fellow, members of the senate," said i Mr, Harding. "No riiember of this f body could be more reluctant to "leave it.

'; Pledges His Assistance. 'I like the freedom, the associa . tion, the patriotic sense of responsi- 'bility which abides here.

'-, but I mean, at the same time, to be U- just as insistent about the responsi- ;n bilities of the executive. Our gov' ernmental good fortune does not lie "tf in any surrender at either end of the avenue, but in the co-ordination and 'co-operation which becomes the tvp in a great and truly representative T popular government, "This brings ie. to the thought .' particularly in mind. Something ,lias been said about the senatorial B oligarchy.' Of course, everyone here ? knows that to be a bit of highly imaginative and harmless fiction. But I do recognize how essential is the helpfulness of the senateiu-the making of a successful adifiinlstra J tion. ;r ; Wants Senate Co-Operation. r, : "I want to express tbday the wish of a colleague for the confidehce and 2 the co-operation of the members pf 3 'this body in' the four years which be I -gin next March 4. I do not limit l-this sincere request to this side of ithe aisle. One cannot-promise agree- ment in all things with art "opposite S party which is sometimes insistently jKwronsr. but we may find common S, ground in the spirit of service, and U S hope for that agreeable and courte- ous and ofttimes helpful relationship s Hvith the opposite side which has added to the delights of fellow serv- 'ice during the past six years. J f "We are facing no easy task.-' We ?. jiave our full part in the readjust 3 inent of human affairs, after the ? -world tumult. We have our tasks .at home, we have our" part in the in- ievitable Work of the civilized world. ?. V ''With propriety I cannot venture Siiponany suggestions now, even 5 though I am speaking as a member tf this body. Three months of the present administration remain, and 2 cordially in making them truittul father than wasted months. There is so much to be done, and we have already had so much-- of delay,, that I should like unanimous reedgni t tion that there are no party ends 3 to serve, but precious days are call - ing for service to our common J country. "I cannot resist the repetition of ; my regret that my association on j this floor and in committee, rooms is ending today. Let me express f, the hope to one and alf that, though there conies a change in official re v, lationship,- it will not Interrupt our co-operation, nor deprive us of the 1 personal fellowship which I have ,! found to be a great compensation r for the sacrifices of conscientious i public service." 1 Bjoth Sides Applaud. it "Our governmental good for ; ltine," he said, "does not lie in any 4 mrrender at either end of the ave s nue. but in the- co-ordination and '$ co-operation which becomes the two It, in a great and truly representative ; popular government. . .... We are facing no easy task. I am sure :2 that the necessity of wise solution J .wilt inspire us to work together, to r take common counsel, to be toler ' ant of one another 'and to give the best that is in all of us." j f Applause from both sides of the chamber answered him artd after the brief senate session adjourned, re- publicans and democrats crowded ? around him to offer their congratu : Jations. Everywhere he went about .the capitol he was besieged ' by crowds, and scores of callers i swarmed about his office all day in the hope of a conference with him. The president-elect's talks with s congressional leaders and with his " political advisers took place in the 1 office of Senator Lodge where he 2 went as soon as he reached the "5 capitol and remained most of the clay.

"t preached throughout the cam paign, the gospel of understanding," said Mt. Harding, tonight in ex plaining the, purpose of hisvisit, "and I am trying to put into prac tice immediately. I don't want these three months to be wasted in gain ing any partisan advantage. I have asked senators particularly to ex pedite the appropriation bills, so that none erf them shall go ovfer to the next session and so that we shall have the decks clear for a very likely extra session." Asked how soon the extra session mieht be expected to follow his I. (inauguration, he replied that the eact time naa not Deen jixea our that he though it would come "very soon." In his discussion of foreign af fairs with those , who called upon him. the .oresident-elect is under stood to nave indicated no definite nft for an association ot nations but to hav shown enfidence that his enferences on the subject t be gin in Marion next week would tud nish a bashis for agreement. "I am trying," he said tonight, "to find a line where we can essentially get together on matters foreign re lations. I am trying to get to gether with the senate because of its co-ordinate power in the ratifi cation of treaties." Discnss Domestic Issues. Among tWe.dwnestic issues dis cussed in the conferences, taxation and tariff were foremost. It is. ex pected that although he did not en cpurage an attempt to frame tariff legislation at the present session, he suggested that both senate and house might well begin hearings on the subject to provide data for use" after March 4. He.is Said to have expressed hope that a budget bjll would be passed at the prPsrnt ses sion and that action oTPsome of the nominations submitted by the demo cratic administration be delayed un til the new congress comes into of fice. ' Senator Calder requested that Mr. Harding give attention to the coal situation with a view of framing re ftf measures nromotlv Avhen he be comes president and several others who .tailed presetited in detail other problems likely to come before the new administration. Tonight Senator and Mrs. Hard ing were dinner guests of Senator and Mrs. New and during the eve ning the conferences with congres sional leaders were continued. Sev eral more are to be held tomorrow. How long Mr. Hardig will remain in Marion is uncertain, but his pres ent plans are to spend most of De cember and January there. A trip to Florida or to some other southern state during February is under con sideration, but it is likely that he will come to Washington before the inauguration. Congress Ready for President's Message (Continued From ! On.) consideration, tmder limitation of debate. More than 330 new bills and reso lutions were dropped into the house hopper today and a flood of similar proportions is expected tomorrow in the senate. The new house mea sures deal with almost every con ceivable subject, including proposals for repeal of war laws, for appro priations of millions of dollars for a myriad of purposes, pensions and many measures for farmers' relief. Committees of both senate and house are to begin work immediate ly on the measures left on their cal endars from preceding sessions and on the new grist. Calls for numer ous commiMee meetings this week were issued by chairmen today, but leaders said tht the regular appro priation bills would have the right of way." They added that it was hoped to pass all of the appropria tion bills before March 4, but that considerable other legislation would be "squeezed in."

' Wanted to Talk. v President Wilson, it is said, was somewhat inclined to take the oppor tunity to appear in person, but other counsel prevailed. It was urged upon the president that no real oc casion existed for making a personal journey to the capital and that he ought not to endanger his progress toward health by the fatigue and strain that such a record breaking appearafice would entail. Ihere is nothing to prevent tne president from changing his mind before noon tomorrow, but the prob abilities areJie will not go.
