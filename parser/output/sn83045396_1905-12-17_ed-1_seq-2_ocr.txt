WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 -The Senate today passed the Panama canal emer gency appropriation bill, but the ranilt was not attained until after the debate on the bill had been continued the greater part of thi' ) iy. to the exclusion of prac tically all other business. Set speeches wen- made by Mr Bucon In advocacy Oi his amendment requiring estimates for the canal commission salaries; by Mr Allison, who devoted himself largely to the details of the bill; Mr Culberson, who criticised the employment of Mr Bishop as a "press agent;" by Mr. Stone, who criticised the purchase of American ships to carry Panama supplies In face of the ami unccd determination to go abroad for vessels under the conditions then existing, and by Mr Newlande, who expressed the opinion that the construc tion of the canal should have been en trusted to the geological survey. Estimate of Salaries. A substitute for Mr. Hncon's amend ment, offered by Mr. Hale, was accepted. It specifically requires that Congress shall be supplied with regular estimates of nl! salaries except those paid to laborers, 'killed and unskilled. Otherwise the bill was passed as reported from the com mittee. During the debate Mr. Hale made the authorized announcement that Mr Bish op's duties as "press agent" would be discontinue d. Prevent Extravagance. I In support of his amendment Mr. Bacon said that under the present system Con gress was deprived of the opportunity for proper scrutiny of the salaries paid to the commission employees. Although there was really stronger grounds for such attempts In the case of the canal saaaaaa "mployees than In the regular depart- menu of the Government, he said such a -Ourse would go fur toward preventing the extravagance practiced on the com nlsslon work Inconsistency of Salaries. H commented on the fact that Mr. Shonts's salary was more than twice as much as that paid to the Chief Justice the Supreme court, and said It wan not the policy of the Government to emu late the high salaries paid bv private cor poratlons Even the auditor of the com mission gets $10,000, while the man who passes upon his work receives only 14000. and the executive head of the depart -mont. the Secretary of War Only fSOOQ.

"I would not pay any of them more than I i he Chief -lustlce Is paid." the Georgia Senator declared. Mr. Spooner expressed the opinion thai M President ought to be given sufllcleut latitude In the matter of salary to se cure the best possible engineering talent, aylng that the competition among rail roads for such talent was such that It could not be procured for small pav Mr. Bacon, referring to the payment of .' in thf- canal i ommisslon auditor i .-aid.

Criticises the '-Revolution" Mr. Culberson expressed the opinion that die lie thud "t si i-urlng control on the Isthmus had been 'indefensible In Ian ; nd Infamous l.i morals." He called at- ntlon to the fact thai, while the original estimate for the complete construction f th. e.in.il had !) . n $1SI th-r had nl- reudy been expended no less than $70,500 -000 f this amount, ho said. $10,000,000 had In . ii paid to the Intriguers who, un- der the shadow of the Capitol in Wash ington, had planned the Panama revolu tion. Not Insurance Methods. Speaking of the salaries paid In the canal work, he said that doubtless some of them were extravagant, but h- was not prepared to agree that there had been an attempt to place these salaries on the some basis as the salaries paid b the large Insurance companies Speaking of these companies, he said: "They are the greatest aggregation of lnrdlv thliis and unconsi-lona bio per Jurera this age. has yet developed. Invade All Fields. "They Invade all fields; they traffic In pollt lea l Influence without regard to party lines, as a merchant with the wares on his shelves. They have invaded the sanctity of legislatures State nnd Na tional, and one of the most humiliating circumstances connected with the whole business Is Iho fact that they found a Democrat on whom they fastened their graft at 25 per cent of the amount in quired to secure the services of a Repub lican for the same work." Gone Out With a Fizzle. Mr Stone recalled the policy announced by the canal authorities Ia-t spring with reference to the purchase of foreign ships to be used In the canal work when they eould be secured more expeditiously and more cheaply than American vessels. He based his remarks upon extracts outlin ing the policy, taken from the Washing ton Post characterizing It as one of the leading papers of the country. The policy had, he said, met with his Instant ap proval, but he was sorry to say that while It had been "Inaugurated with mneh thundering It had gone out with a fizzle." He said that the policy of going abroad for ships had been based on the theory that there Were no available ships to bo had In the United States, and he declared tliat there hnd been no change In the con ditions between May. when the policy was adopted, nnd July, when two ships wre DOUghl from the Ward line at the price of $1,800,000. This purchase. Mr. Stone eonteinjed. ntui ueen made at the price given when two vessels of eo.ual capacity could have been bought In Eng land for $760,000. Gallinger Explains It. Mr Gallinger said that the English ships belonged to ft concern that had failed and were a bargain counter affair and they were disposed of to other parties before the proffer at the price given could be Investigated. Mr Newlands spoke on the general merits of the canal enterprise, express ing the opinion that the canal work should have been entrusted to the Geo logical survey, as the Irrigation reclam ation work had been.

One of the curiosities of Chicopee, Mass., Is a goose which follows Its mas ter all over the city and shows as tnu.-h affection as a dog. JahiGfl Rice is the owner of the goose, and H is ever at his heels No matter how fast Mr Rice walks, the goose manages to wad dle along fast enough to keep up. When Mr. Rice stops tr talk, the bird squats contentedly on the curbstone or slips through the fence into some yard to pick up something to car. But the minute his master gives a pcoullat whistle, the bird Is back at his side once more. The goose has the distinction, also, of being the mascot of Chlcopee's vet eran firemen, and always accompanies them on their musters. Mr. Rice has m.de a little red suit for the bird, and he was a feature at the last muster. He waddles along in the parade until he becomes fatigued, and then Mr. Rice tucks the bird under his arm for the rest of the march. Mr. Rice and the bird first struck up an acquaintance when Mr Rico was laid up with a sore knee. Pie was sit ting In the doorway one morning w hen the goose came lumbering up, peered Into his face, and said Inquiringly, "Quack, quack?" "Good-morning, won't you sit down?." said Mr. Rice, and the bird hopped up oil i he doorsteps The next morning he made another visit, and then continue I them every da. tnlkliNg more each time, until Mr. Rice was able to walk around the yard.

HIGH-PRICED SILVER Mexican Dollars Now Worth More as Bullion Than as Coin. The shipment of $1,850,000 gold to Mexico last week was attributed direct ly to the purchase of Mexican silver dollars In that country for export to Europe and the far East This export of silver from Mexico was the result of tho advance In piher, which gave the dollar a greater value us bullion than ns coin In order in prevent a similar outflow of Philippine silver coins, the authorities of those Islands recently made it Illegal to export Philippine sil ver coins, thus preventing the With drawal ": th coin from circulation. The advance in silver this past week per ounce In London, and to K cents her- was the highest price reached bj silver since 1S96 In that ;.,ii silver bullion wns nnoted In Lon don as high as 31 l.VlSd per ounce. The highest price since then until this past vi eeh v as "vi in 1900. The advance in silver at this time is regarded as the result of legitimate trade factors, rather than of specula tion. Until quite recently the specu latlve activity was chiefly on the short side of the market The covering of a large short interest has indeed been an incident of the continuous advance .if the metal Apart from this short covering, one of the chief factors In the advance has been the purchases of s!ler by the India Council. The In dustrial demand for silver has also grown largely Trade authorities state that the supply of the metal has not increased as rapidly as tho demand. New York Times. The Road to Heaven.
