The building burned rapidly and the firemen were only able to keep down the flames so that dwellings nearby were protected from the fire. Tbe origin of the fire is unknown.

A number of people think that rab bits cannot be bought and sold in Penn sylvania, and it has been so stated in at least one newspaper, but tbe game law states plainly that rabbits can be bought and sold. The law says: "And that all kinds of game killed in this Common wealth, excepting deer, wild turkey, ruffed-grouse, woodcock, quail, com monly called Virginia partridge, and Hungarian quail may be bought and sold within the Commonwealth during the open season for such game, and for thirty days thereafter." Rabbits that are killed out of season for destroying cultivated crops or trees (which the law allows) cannot be used for food nor cannot be sold. It is pos sible that this has given the Impression to some people that rabbits cannot be sold at any time. Sunday School Officers.

Some of our subscribers thoughtlessly forget to bring or send to this office the necessary power to keep the machinery moving. It is as impossible to run a newspaper without money as to keep a horse alive without feed. Good in tentions not executed tall to meet the requirements.
