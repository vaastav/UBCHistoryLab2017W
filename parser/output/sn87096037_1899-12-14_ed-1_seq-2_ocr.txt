A LATE issue of the London Times stated that at least a score of persons perish each year in Switzerland in try ing to secure the wonderful snow flower—the edelweiss—which grows in very inaccessible places. Some of those who lose their lives trying to secure it are reckless tourists others are Swiss boys, who wish to get it that they may sell it to travelers. THE Austrian post office is to try a •'telegram card," on which a person writes a message and posts in the usual way, but the post office telegraphs the contents, which arc delivered to the address by the postman. The plan is a combination of post and telegraph, and seems useful as having a cost and tpeed intermediate between pest and telegraph. THEUE is at present under construc tion an electric machine which will be used on the elevated stations for sell ing tickets. The machine referred to is to be constructed in such a way that when you drop your nickel in the slot you will receive a ticket in exchange. There will be four of these on-each of the larger, stations. The reason why this system has been adopted by the railroad trustees is to do away with the expense of having an agent on each station. 

KINGSTON, Jamaica, has an electric tramway, the power for which is dp rived from a hydraulic plant operate by two, lio,rizoi)tal. tprbjpesj. direct connected to two three-phase afierna-' tors of 360 horse-power each, generat ing current at 550 vohs. This pres sure, by means of transformers, is stepped up to 14.C03 volts and the cur rent thus transmitted to a substation 21 miles distant. Ilere it is transform ed down to 350 volts and converted in to continuous current by two syn chronous converters. GRANITE is not considered to be an insulator, but one of the electrical journals reports that insulators aro made as follows: Maine granite is crushed and molded into" form and fused at 8.000 degrees Fahrenheit. It resists all but hydrofluoric "acid, a :d does not crush at a lower pressure than 14,500 pounds per square inch and gives a tensile strength of 4S0 pounds per square inch 50.000 volts were re quired to pierce one-quarter of an inch of this material in the shape of cup insulators. jii'.NEST BAUKB, an extensive poultry raiser of CoHevville, Ivan., having read in an agricultural journal that boracic acid would preserve chicken meat al most indefinitely, assumed that the chemical should be mixed with the feed of the fowls and given to them to cat. He tried the experiment, with the result that 7G2 of his 803 chickens died within 24 hours. He sued the ed itor of the paper, but the court held that any man of ordinary intelligence should have known better than to try to preserve the flesh of living fowls by means of chemicals. JOHN H. PAGE, JR., who was recently commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 3d iufantry, is the third of the name to serve in the army of the United States. His father, John H. Page, is colonel of the 3d infantry and served in Cuba during the war. taking part in the fighting about Santiago. He was the last of the regular army colonels to leave Cuba. His grand father, John H. Page, was killed at the battle of Palo Alto during the Mexican war. For more than 50 years there has always been a John II. Page among the o^icers of the army.

Synopsis of His Annual Communi cation to Congress. Treats Exlinimtively of the Subjects of Flntinclnl LegiRlatlon, the Trnxli nuil tlie Affairs of (lie Dif ferent Colonic*. President McKinley's annual message to congress, of which the following is a syn opsis of the principal features, is a docu ment of about 32,000 words. It begins with a tribute to. the worth of Vice 1-resident Hoburt and an announcement of his death. Following that is a statement of the prosperity which the country is enjoying and statistics of our exports and imports fcr the your, in which it is shown that we have exported during the year more than $1,000,000,000 worth of goods, more than the total of both our exports and imports in 1S70. Of the exports for the past year he says: "Exports of agricultural products were $7S4,770,142. Of manufactured products we exported in value $339,582,146, being larger than any previous year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad wore IS US and 1S99." lie calls attention to the report of the secretary of the treasury and his estimate of the receipts and expenditures for the present fiscal year, showing a surplus of $40,000,000. He points to the present grat ifying strength of the treasury, and says that on December 1 the cash balance on hand was $278,004,837.72, -of which $289,744, 905.86 was in gold and bullion. He notes the resumption of bond pur chases, and recommends important changes in the banking laws to aliow na tional banks to organize with a capital of $25,000. He strongly recommends the adoption of the gold standard, and on this subject says: "While there is now no commercial fright which withdraws gold from the govern ment, but, on the contrary, such wide spread confidence that gold seeks the treasury demanding paper money in ex change, yet the very situation points to the present as the most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continu ance of the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of the governrritnt to meet all its obligations in the money which the civilized world recog nizes as the best. The financial transac tions of the government are conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States bonds and use gold for their payment. We are maintaining the parity of all the money issued or coined by authority of the government. We are do ing these things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are not compelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past, however, and may have to be done in the future. It be hooves us, therefore, to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, and the best means are those which are the most certain and ec&nomical. Those now authorized have the virtue neither of directness nor economy. We have already eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight and embarrassment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1896. Our receipts now equal cur expenditures: deficient revenues no longer create alarm. Let us remove the only remaining cause by conferring the full and necessary power on the secretary of the treasury and impose upon him the duty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity with each other, which is the repeatedly declared policy of the United States. "In this connection I repeat,my former recommendation that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund frcm which greenbacks shall be re deemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out except for gold." He recommends such legislation as will increase our merchant marine, and points out the fact that our increased trade de mands increased carrying facilities. The subject of trusts is dwelt upon at length, and congress is urged to seek a remedy for the evils they produce. He urges speedy action on this subject either by the extension of the present laws in such a manner as to regulate the combina tions of capital, which he pronounces ob noxious, -or by the enactment of such new laws as are necessary. The entire history of trust legislation by congress is reviewed as well as the utterances on the subject of both Presidents Cleveland and Harrison quoted. He says state legislation has proven ineffective, and that now congress _QUist devise the means to check the grow H. E wil. the e.ust&pftitirt review qKfc our rela tions with foreign countries iduring the year there is nothing unusual shown. Our neutrality in the Transvaal is recorded the reestablishment of friendly relations noticed: various happenings of minor im portance in South America spoken of, and a recommendation made for the appoint ment of a commission to visit China and study the commercial and industrial wants of the country with a view of increasing American markets. The subject of a Nicaraguan canal is treated of the work of the commission to survey the different routes outlined as far as possible, and former recommendations asking for the undertaking of Its construc tion renewed. The Paris exposition receives a lengthy mention, with a somewhat detailed account of the showing this country will make in Paris at that time, and the announcement that we will have there more than 7,000 exhibitors. Referring to the Canadian boundary, he says that much progress has been made by the commission appointed to reach, if possible, a satisfactory solution of the difficulty between the two nations, and he hopes that their deliberations will end suc cessfully. Germany, he says, continues to find fault with our food products, but that a solution of the difficulties in that line with that country is hoped for in the near future. He calls-attention to the urgent need of a Pacific cable to Manila, and makes the following recommendation: "I recommend that, in case the congress should not take measures to bring about this result by direct action of the gov ernment, the postmaster general be au thorized to invite competitive bids for the establishment of a cable the company making the best responsible bid to be awarded the contract the successful com pany to give ample bonds to insure the completion of the work withina reasonable time." A review of the whole Samoan question Is given from the time of the tripartite agreement between the three powers down to the present time, but nothing is said of our having refused to ratify the treaty made between Great Britain and Germany, but to which wc are a party. The final settlement of the difficulties of the powers by a division of the islands between Ger many and this country is pronounced sat isfactory. Of affairs in Cuba he maintains that our agreement with the people of that island must be kept as a sacred obligation, says that substantial progress has been made towards fitting-the Cubans for self-govern ment, and intimates that next April would be a fitting time in which to hold elections In the island, as by that time the census n-ow being taken will have been completed, and it will be known who are entitled to a vote and who arc not. Of the reforms being instituted in Cuba and paid for out of the Cuban revenues, the president says: "Out of the Cub£.n island revenues during the six months ending June 20, 1899, $!, 712,014.20 was expended' for sanitation, $293,881.70 for charities and hospitals and $88,944.03 for aid to the destitute." He pronounces the peace congress at The Hague, in which this country was repre sented, a success, and the results obtained "a realization of the earnest desires of many of our people." Of the different departments of the gov ernment service the routine work is dis missed with a short mention, and a few recommendations. He approves of Secre tary bong's request for additional battle ships and for armor plate. Reviews the work of lhe war department in the muster ing out of volunteers and the mustering in of a new force: Rives the statistics of our army now In the Philippines at 45,966 offi cers and irn'ti. which will soon be increased arrival of now troops to more than 65,000 men and officers. Ho praises highly the valor and patriotism of the volunteers who remained In the service after the rati fication of the peace treaty until such time as new troops could he sent to renlace them.

Hei says that American sovereignty will be maintained so long as the govern ment of the islands is allowed to remain in his hands, and deems the time not yet ripe for recommendations for their future government. Of the work of reconstruc tion going on in the islands he says: "The unfavorable circumstances connect ed with an active campaign have not been permitted to interfere with the equally im portant work of reconstruction. Again I invite your attention to the report of the commissioners for the interesting and en couraging details of the work already ac complished in the establishment of peace ana order and the inauguration of 'self governing municipal life Jn many portions of the archipelago. A notable beginning has been made in the establishment of a government in the island of Ncgros, which is deserving of special consideration. This was the first Island to accept American sovereignty. Its people unreservedlv pro claimed allegiance to the United States and »aopted a constitution looking to the es tablishment of a popular government. It was impossible to guarantee to the people Negvos that the^constitution so adopted should be the ultimate form of govern- m£rtt. Such a question, under the treaty with Spain, and in accordance with our own constitution and laws, came exclu sively within the jurisdiction of congress. The government actually set up by the Inhabitants of Negros eventually proved unsatisfactory to the natives themselves. A new system was put into force by order of the major general commanding the de partment, which was entirely successful." The president asks for an immediate reconstruction of the government of the Hawaiian islands. .He says that which they have at the present time is neither their old government nor is it the new which they asked this country to give them with annexation. He urges strongly the ne^os^ity for the immediate establishment of floral courts in the islands that the eniorcement of civil rights may be prose cuted. He asks also for important legislation for Alaska. He would have the courts in creased and a form of local and municipal government given the people of the terri tory. For Porto Rico the president asks for much the same legislation that he desires for Alaska. He believes the time has come for the organization of a temporary form of civil government in the island, and he makes the following recommendations: "It is desirable that the government of the island under the law of belligerent right, now maintained through the execu tive department, should be superseded by an administration entirely civil in its na ture. For present purposes I recommend that congress pass a law for the organiza tion of a temporary government, which shall provide for the appointment by the president, subject to confirmation by the senate, of a governor and such other offi cers as the general administration of the island may require, and that for legislative purposes on subjects of a local nature not partaking of a federal character a legisla tive council, composed partly of Porto Ricans and partly of citizens of the United States, shall be "nominated and appointed by thepresident, subject to confirmation by the senate, their acts to lie subject to the approval of the congress or the president prior to going into effect. Tn the munici palities and other local subdivisions I rec ommend that the principle of local se\f government be applied at once, so as to enable the intelligent cltizefis of the island to participate in their own p'overrment and to learn by practical experience the duties and requirements of a self-contained and a self-governing: people. I have not thought It wise to commit the entire government of the island to officers selected by the peoDle, because I doubt whether in habits, tralnine and experience they are such as to fit them to exercise at once so large a decree of self-government, but it is mv judgment and expectation that they will soon arrive ot an attainment of expe rience ard wisdom and self-control that will justify conferring upon them a much larger participation in the choice of their insular officers." Paragraphs on lynchinirs. the civil serv ice and a few minor subjects complete the message. A 

PEDDLER'S PINK SATIN. Hon' It Figured in a Pretty Little Romance of Revolutionary Time*. A pretty anecdote of a revolutionary bride is related by Ellen D. Larned in a recent little volume upon the local deeds and traditions of a Connecticut county. The incident occurred soon after the 'first successes 5f the rebel privateers. A beautiful young girl, betrothed and shortly to be married, admitted one day to the house a wandering peddler, who undid his pack and displayed his wares. She expected, doubtless, to purchase some pretty trifle to add to her wedding outfit but times were hard, there was little money to spare, and moreover it wras not many months since all imported finery had been so frowned upon that no patriotic young woman could ven ture to buy it, nor any dealer to sell it. AVhat, then, was the young woman's amazement and delight when the ped dler unrolled a voluminous piece of the most beautiful pink satin—satin, too, quite innocent and inoffensive to the most ardently patriotic eye, since he explained that it was a trophy of war, the booty of one of our own privateers! She gazed upon it in fascination. What a wedding dress it would make! But the cost—she could not, she dared not, ask so much money of her father. Nor did she. But unrolling the ex quisite fabric yet further, she draped the rosy folds flowingly about her sup ple young figure, and crossing the room to where all the time her father, stern and silent man, had sat writing at his accounts, observing nothing, she sank upon her knees at his feet. A hand was laid on his knee he looked down, wondering, and she looked up, pleading—and then lie un derstood. Not a word was spoken on either side, but the old man's hand went quietly into his desk, drew out a purse, opened it and laid in his daughter's hand 40 silver dollars. At the wedding that sot a ensued the bride's gown and bridegroom's waist coat were both of pink satin and there was one more pretty story to hand down of a real Daughter of the Revolu tion.—Youth's Companion. Production of Argol. TheUnited States department of state has lately issued a special collective consular report on the production of argol in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. This substance its a by-product of the fermentation of wine, the alcohol as it forms causing the precipitation of the argol, or crude tartar, which was soluble in the nonalcoholic juice of the grape. The chief countries which im port argol, or tartar, are the United States and Britain, the shipments to the United States being double those of nil the other countries combined. Since it is used here in the niiinufaclure of bak ing powder. The extent to which tartar is lifted in combination with food prod UCIK would, perhaps, be "most eiislly luoerlitined from (lie export books of (lie luimcroiiH linking powder (Inns of the Hulled States, uiilesit the relative prevalence of dysjiepkla In various countries should beileeiiied 11 kiilllclent niifcwer."—Clileiigo Tribune, (Juimai, Viirry—MU* Morion lolil me Hint she tliiiutjiil you vnre (|iilti! ,i iiijiiiorlst, Jllirfift-iiv'i'ii Ueiilly, I I'eiiy At leiibl uueuM tliut. wiu wliiit *lii!

Postmaster General Snildi Point* bnl the Ahum ami Needs of HI* Department. Washington, Deo. 4.—The annual report et Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith is made public. Its chief feature is a plea for congressional action to stop the abuse of second-class mail privileges, which, he says, results in an annual waste of upwards of $20,000,000. The financial ex hibit for the fiscal year shows total ex penditures of $101,632,162, and total receipts of $95,021,384, the deficiency being $2,422,747 less than last year. Regarding our new possessions tho post master general says: "The presenco of United States troops In the new Island pos sessions and Cuba, in constant communi cation with home, constrained the estab lishment of mail facilities for their needs and the practical obliteration of the old local postal system with the extinguish ment of Spanish authority compelled a re construction of the whole service for the requirements of tho native population." "The free delivery of mails in the rural districts has proved to be one of the most important among rccent developments of tho postal service, and presents in its pos sibilities a question of the largest propor tions. The results already attained have been of a significant character, and the practical evidences Rearing upon tho feasi bility of the system, upon the degree of Its self-support and upon the effect and the sentiment in the communities where It has been tried, deserve tho most careful consid eration. How far the system shall be ex tended is submitted for the determination of congress, with a full presentation of facts upon which to base a conclusion. This service has been called 'experimental' in each appropriation made by congress for Its continuance. It is tho opinion of the officers having it in charge that the experi mental stage has been passed, and In their view I coincide. The appropriation for rural free delivery service for the present fiscal year was Increased from $150,000 to $300,000, and this amount will bo practically absorbed by the continuance to tho end of tho fiscal year of the service already es tablished. It Is nowin successful operation from 300 distributing points, scattered among 40 states and one territory (the only states unrepresented in tho list being Ida ho, Mississippi, Montana and Wyoming), giving service to 179,131 people, at an aver age annual cost of 84 cents per capita. "The benefits accruing from the exten sion of postal facilities to tho rural com munities may be summarized as follows: Increased postal receipts, making many of the new deliveries almost immediately self-supporting enhancement of the value of farm lands reached by this scrvice and better prices obtained for farm products through moro direct communication with the markets and prompter information of their state Improved means of travel, some hundreds of miles of country roads, especially in the western states, having been graded specifically in order to obtain rural delivery higher educational Influ ences, broader circulation of the means of public intelligence and closer dally con tact with the great world of activity ex tended to the homes of heretofore Isolated rural communities." 

WANTS MORE SHIPS. Secretary Long Urecs Farther In crease of Oar Navy and Make* Other Sngsrestlons. Washington, Dec. 4.—The annual report of the secretary of the navy, Just made pub tic, is a document.of unusual interest, deal ing not only with the work of the navy during the past year and important recom mendations for the future, but also dis cussing the more important questions re lating to the navy, including the authori zation of 18 new warships, the imperative need1 of special legislation In the early days of congress for armor of the best quality that can bo obtained and the prop osition that the thanks of congress be given to the commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic squadron and to the offi cers and men under his command for the part they took In the naval operations at Santiago.. The secretary gives a table showing naval construction going on abroad, as compared with that In tha^Unlted States. From this It appears that'only Italy and Japan lata down less tonnage than this country during the present year, and that Italy alone had less tonnage under construction. The total tonnage under construction Is: England, 531,680 France, 255.533: Germany, 14S.235 Italy, 120,540 Japan, 130,000 Russia, 222,976 United States, 123,236. Secretary Long refers to the return, of Admiral Dewey and his enthusiastic wel come from the whole country. After speak ing of the New York reception and the sword presentation in Washington the sec retary sums up by saying it was the na tion's tribute. Among tho many other topics treated is that for fostering the naval reserve, the consolidation of the naval bureaus of con struction, engineering and equipment in the interest of more harmonious action the construction of barracks for enlisted men, and a review of the various bureau recom mendations, the desirability of changing the material of the League Island and the Mare Island dry docks from timber to stone and concrete. The warships claiming tiounty and prize money from their cap tures and engagements during the war are set forth in detail. He says the sur vey of the trans-Pacific cable route indi cates that it will be entirely practicable. It is intended also to survey a cable route from Guam to Yokohama. It Is proposed to supply all new ships with smokeless powder. Robbers Use Dynamite. Streator, 111., Dec. 6.—The bank of Cornell was visited by six men at an early hour Tuesday morning, who, after wrecking the safe vault and building with dynamite cartridges, made their escape, carrying nearly $5,000 in cash with them. A young man named States, who came upon them while at work was bound and gagged, seated in a chair and witnessed the blowing open of the safe. When they left he managed to release him self and give the alarm. Three of the burglars went toward Pontiac, and the officers there found tliem in the Chicago & Alton yards. After a lively fight two were captured and $700 of money found on them. Molineux Witness Dead. .New York, Dec. 7.—Percy H.

He also suggests such modifications In exist ing banking laws am will limit the amount of liability a bank may carry upon a given amount of capital, pointing: out that under existing laws the bank with $50,000 capital stahds legally as free as does the bank with a capital of $5,000,000.

Washington, Dec. 6.—Attorney Gen eral Griggs, in his annual report to con gress, reviews the work of the depart ment of justice during the year, and then says that application is occasion ally made to the department to have legal proceedings brought in the name of the United States against corpora tions or combinations of companies that are alleged to be engaged in form ing or maintaining monopolies or agree ments in restraint of trade or compe tition. "Such action," the attorney general says, "can be maintained only when the offense comes within the scope of the federal statute.

Opening Session of the House and Senat—House Votes to Investi gate Roberts Case. Washington, Dec. S. Knorroous crowds witnessed the opening scenes in the house Monday. The principal in terest centered in the disposition of the case of Mr. Roberts, the Mormon repre sentative from Utah. Those who an ticipated a sensational denouement were disappointed. The programme outlined by the republican leaders at their conference on Friday night was partially carried out. The objection to the administration of the oath to Mr. Roberta was entered by Mr. Taylor (O.), as predicted, and lie'stepped aside without protest except to ask if by do ing so he waived any of his rights. To this .the speaker responded in the neg ative. There was not a protest from any quarter against the objection to the administration of the oath to Mr. Rob erts. But, on the contrary, the only voice raised except that of Mr. Taylor's was that of Mr. McRae (dem., Ark.), who joined with Mr. Taylor in his pro test. Mr. Taylor offered his resolution to refer the case to a special committee, but by mutual arrangement the con sideration of the resolutionjkvas post poned until to-day in order that the routine business in connection with the organization might be transacted Mon day. Washington, Dec. 5.—An appropriate tribute to the memory of late Vice President Ilobart was paid by the sen ate Monday at its first session of the Fifty-sixth congress. The session last ed only 33 minutes and only the most formal and necessary business was transacted. After the adoption of the usual routine resolutions and the ad ministration to the new members of the oath of office. Senator Sewell (X. J.) presented fitting resolutions upon the death of the vice president the reso lutions were ordered to be communi cated to the house of representatives, and the session, on motion of Senator Ivean (N. J.), was suspended. Washington, Dec. 0.—After an inter esting debate of three hours the house Tuesday by a vote of 302 to 30 adopted the resolution offered by Mr. Tayler (O.) Monday for the appointment of a special committee to investigate the charges against Brigham H. Roberts, the Mormon representative-elect from Utah. Previously the house had re jected a substitute resolution offered by Mr. Richardson, the leader of the minority, to allow Mr. Roberts to be sworn in and' to send the whole case to the judiciary committee. Of the 30 who voted against the Tayler resolu tion all were democrats except two, Mr. Loud, a California republican, and Mr. Newlarids, a silverite from Nevada. By the terms of the resolution Mr. Rob erts is not only excluded' from all par ticipation in the proceedings of the house until the committee reports and the house passes upon his case, but he is denied a seat in the hall. Whether this will be interpreted to deny him admission within the chamber pending the disposition of his case is yet to be decided. The speaker appointed the following members as the special committee to investigate the case: Republicans— Tayler (O.), .chairman Landis (Ind.), Morris (Minn.), Freer (W. Va.), Lit tlefield (Mc.), McPherson (la.). Demo ocrats—De Armond (Mo.), Lanliam (Tex.) and Meyers (Ind.), Washington, Dec. 7.—The republican caucus unanimously approved the ljouse financial bill and recommended its immediate consideration and pas sage. The bill was not amended ex cept in two minor particulars. IN 

SORE STRAITS. Doer Sieve of Ladysmlth Grows More Severe—Shelllna of Tonn Groiv Inc Effective. Londofi.'Dec. 7. A budget of news from Ladysmith, which arrived Wednesday, brings the history of the beleaguered garrison up to November 29. In spite of the rumors of a retro grade movement on the part of the Boers, the stories just received show that the garrison, although still strong, was suffering from confinement, re stricted diet, and the increasing volume of the Boer artillery fire, especially that of additional heavy calibre gun placed in position 5,000 j-ards from the west ern defenses. The dispatches relate that the Boers had discovered the most vulnerable points of the garrison and that shelling was becoming disagree ably effective. The rations had been re duced and there- was a great deal of sickness. London, Dec. 7.—The sortie from Kimberley on November 25 appears to have been much more serious than had been supposed. Details are now arriv ing of a reconnoissance in force by mounted troops under Maj. Scott-Tur ner at dawn in the direction of a ridge near Carter's farm, where the Boers were strongly intrenched. Finding th'e Boer pickets asleep, Maj. Scott-Turner proceeded along the ridge under cover and rushed the Boer redoubts ut 5:25 a. jm. in the face of a hail of bullets. The Boers hoisted a white flag and fired at the British under its protection before surrendering. There appeared to be some doubt as to whether this was the reconnais sance in which, according to the an nouncement of the war office, Maj. Scott-Turner was killed, or whether that officer met his fate in a subse quent sortie. G. A. R. Encampment. Chicago, Dec. 7.—The thirty-fourth annual encampment of the Grand Army of the Republic will be held in Chicago August 28, 20, 30 und 31, 1900.

The Vebrasknn Statesman Passes Away After a Long Illness nt Nebraska City. Nebraska City, Neb., Dec. 6.—Senator1 Hay ward died at 6:20 Tuesday morn ing- United States Senator Monroe L. Hay ward was G9 years old and had lived in Nebraska City for 32 years. Although a lawyer by profession, he made his wealth largely through investments In lands in Nebraska and Kansas. His election to the United States senate was his flrst ap pearance in national politics. 1-Ie was de feated for governor by Poynter two years ago, reducing the fusion majority from 18.COO to 3,000. When the last legislature was found to be republican Mr. Hayward announced his candidacy for the United States senate, and the light which fol lowed was one of the bitterest in the his- it SENATOR MONROE L. HAYWARD. tory of the state. The long drawn-out caucus deadlock Anally resulted in his election, but scon afterwards he was stricken with paralysis while addressing a political meeting. Senator Hayward was a veteran of the civil war, serving In the Twenty-second regiment of New Tork volunteers, and later In tho Fifth cavafry. He married Miss Jennie Felton, of Putnam county, N. Y„ In 1S70, and his widow and two sons survive him. WILLING TO QUIT. Filipino Junta Advises Agnltaldo to Surrender—Yoanff Still in Parsnit. New York, Dec. 6.—A special cable gram from Hong-Kong to the Evening World says that Filipinos there an nounce that Aguinaldo is ready to sup render if Consul Wildman will receive him nt Manila. The dispatch adds that the Filipino junta at Hong-Kong was in communication with Aguinaldo/last week and advised him then to throw himself on the mercy of the United States. Washington, Dec. 7.—Gen. Otis Wednesday cabled the war depart ment that he lias had no word of Gen. Young for a week. This is taken to indicate that Young is continuing his hot pursuit of Aguinaldo, and probably is in a country where he regards it as: unsaftf to use couriers. Gen. Otis' dis patch, which follows, also gives an official account of Lieut. Parker's en gagement at Vigan: "Manila,Dec. G.—Gen. Young, with 13com panies infantry and nine troops of cavalry, not heard from since 29th ultimo. He was then about 20 miles south of Vigan and most of troops marching to his support, but then had with him three troops of cav alry, battalion Thirty-third infantry and Macabcbe scouts. One company Thirty third infantry-sent by boat to Vigan to reenforce navy there. Lieut. Col. Parker, Forty-fifth, reports' from 'Vlgari 6th inst. that he has not heard from Young for a week. Insurgents, $00 strong, made at tack on his force, consisting company and 153 sick and footsore men Thirty-third infantry, four o'clock morning 4th, enter ing city in darkness severe street fight ing ensued, continued four hours enemy' driven out, leaving behind 40 dead, 32 pris oners, including many officers, and84 rifles now on outskirts entrenching. Parker says can hold out.indeflnltcly, plenty rations and ammunition. His loss eight enlisted men killed, three wounded. One hundred sixty men now being transported from San Fabian to his relief. Young must be in vicinity with large force." OTIS REVIEWS THE WAR. Commander of the American. Forces Reports on Overatlons in the Philippines. Washington, Dec. t.—The report of Gen. Otis on operations in the Philip pines up to August 31 last -has been made public by the war department. It is a volume of 273 pages, with an ap pendix of minor reports almost as large. The report is a chronological recapitu lation of events in the islands since Gen. Otis took command. One of the most interesting features is the immense amount of detail involved in Gen. Otis' administration of the affairs of the is land. Gen. Otis throws some light on his Chinese exclusion act, declaring it a matter of public policy. He says the step was taken to avoid the rioting and bloodshed that was continually breaking out between the races. In concluding his report Gen. Otis says that it may prove fortunate that Aguinaldo's in surrection was not stamped out in stanter upon its inception. He says that the natives have had a chance toasec the difference between American and na tive methods of government, and his opinion is that they will gladly submit to the former as soon as they can be protected from the hitter. Darned at the Stake. Maysvilie, Ky., Dec. 7.—Richard Cole mun (eolored), confessed murderer of Mrs. James Lashbroolc, wife of his em ployer, expiated his crime in daylight Wednesday at the hands of a mob, con? sisting of thousands of citizens, by be ing burned at- the stake, after suffering torture and fright beyond description. The dreadful spectacle occurred on the cricket grounds on the outskirts of this, one of the oldest and among the proud est cities of Kentucky. The barbarities inflicted upon the young negro can only be accounted for by the intense horror creatcd by long consideration of the atrocious criinc of which full confession has been made by Coleman.
