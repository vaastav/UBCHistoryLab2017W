The people of Orangeville and complaint to make to Stites stage line and arrives here about 12 hours later than it did before train service was inaugurated over the prairie railroad. In short, the mail service at present is most inconvenient and there seems no valid reason why it should not be changed for the The train service is excellent vicinity have a against the present mail service. The mail continues to come via the better. and packages shipped by express reach here much quicker than by the former Why cannot the mail be route. brought over the railroad also? ' Fis strange that with a train every day in the week we receive our mail twelve hours later than we did before a rail- to road was known in Orangeville. Ad mitting that when the mail is brought via the Clearwater route it must be later than formerly according to the train schedule on that line we ask why a change is not brought about. Authorities at the local post office do not anticipate that the mail will be carried over the new railroad until the first of the year and maybe several weeks after that. Some idea of the incapacity of the present service may be gained from the fact that a bundle of Sunday papers from Spokane shipped from that city by express on the Sabbath morning reach here on | the evening train and are distributed in time to be read in one's home upon the same day they are published, Coming by the present mail service, or what is termed a service, the papers do not arrive here until Tues day noon. The suggestion is offered that it 1 would be logical for a citizen in Spo kane or any other nearby city if he wished to start a valuable letter there on Sunday and have it reach here as quickly as possible to send it by ex press rather than by the present mail Instances are already known service. where private parties have experienced losses owing to the present system, j We are informed that Chief Clerk Klwell, of Spokane, has replied to complaints from here with the infor mation that he has received no in structions from the department in re We realize that gard to this matter. perhaps almost any service would not be completely satisfactory to all, but in this instance—after Grangeville people have waited years for better mail and transportation facilities and then to get an excellent train schedule and along with it an inexcusably de ficient mail service—there is undoubt edly just grounds for general dissatis We want better mail service ! faction. Realizing that the completion of 

LIGHTS ON IDAHO AVENUE. all things takes time we urge that Idaho avenue, from the depot to Main street, be properly lighted as soon as possible. The matter has been discussed by the city council but A nothing definite has been done, poorly lighted town is not attractive and the passenger who alights from the depot in darkness Main street in darkness won't brighten Lights could up because he's here. be placed at every crossing along the a cost that would prove j) a mighty good investment The danger from avenue at them in years to come. holdups and robberies is not near so great along a well lighted street and the many other reasons why the av-|£) should be treated to modern enue illumination are to well known to Offices mention.
