The plan is to keep the growers in touch with the market conditions and with each other by means of bulletins and special letters. Congressman Poindexter was unfor tunate in that little speech at Spokane when he made use of the words : " From the night Theodore Roosevelt stepped out of the presidential chair we, as a government, have been going backward," and more just like it. This slap at Pres ident Taft is not enjoyed by the repub licans of the state, something Mr. Poin dexter has found out, Biuce he has not seen fit to repeat It. The farmers of Skagit county, during the recent cold weather and high water in that section, did a kindly act when they fed tons of wheat and oats to save thousands of game birds from starva tion and consequent extinction. Upland birds, such as quail and Chinese pheas ants, were cut off from all food supply and would have starved but for the big hearted farmers. This act of kindness will come back in many ways. The I. W. W.s of Spokane, or their sympathizers, may carry out their threat of killing or attempting to kill Judge Mann and Mayor Pratt, but when they begin their bomb-throwing methods the day of reckoning will be close at hand The I. W. W.s, anarchists and rabid so cialists of the Debs type are a mere hand ful compared to the rest of our people, and our people as a whole are loyal, law abiding and patriotic to the core. The 13th annual report of the secre tary of agriculture, covering the work of the agricultural department for the year 1909, is at hand. It ie a work that should be in the hands of every citizen and care fully perused. Fanners, particularly, will Hud much to interest and i—lll I No government on earth furnishes its people with the doings and workings of the government as does the United States, reports of the great departments being one feature. The message of President Taft sent to congress last week was well received, if comments of the press of the country can be taken as an index. His message waß not as long and spectacular in many respects as those that fell from the pen of Mr. Roosevelt, but it was clear in tone, judicial in expression and covered the subjects demanding public attention. There seems to be one general expression —we have a big country and a big piesi dent, there is no cause for alarm. It is announced that W. A. Halteman of Ferry county will be a candidate for congress from this district at the next election. Mr. Halteman is a republican and has served two terms in the legisla ture. He is engaged in mining, his headquarters being at Meteor Camp. Mr. Halteman was in Colfax a year ago in the interest of the Alaska-Tukon- Pacific Exposition, urging a Whitman county exhibit, making a favorable im. pression on those with whom he came in contact. He is not a mere politician, seeking self glory, but is a thorough going business man, and a business man Is whac we should have in congress. Ab showing the law's delays, the case of F. P. Weymouth, receiver lor the Oudin & Bergman Fir 9 Clay Mining & Manufacturing Co., dissolved partuer ehip, and Thomas F. Conlan against Charles P. Oudin, Eva M. Oudin and the American Fire Brick Co. of Spokane, the supreme court has advised an early set tlement, as for 12 years the company has been in the courts t»nd this makes the 11th appeal to the supreme court. The above case speaks for itself, and is a sample of the way litigation is fre quently carried on in this country. Pres ident Taft was right when be said our judicial procedure needed overhauling. The Washington correspondent of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer i« authority (or the statement that Hugh C. Todd, now taking a course in constitutional law at Georgetown University, will be a candidate for congress next year on the democratic ticket. If not, why not. The only other democratic aspirant we have heard mentioned is Dr. Byrne of Spokane, and the people are getting tired of perennial candidates of the Byrne type as well as Spokane candi date* in general. It would probably do 

COLFAX GAZETTE, COLFAX, WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 17, 1909. the democratic party good to inject some fresh young blood into its veins, and if we must have a democrat in con gress Todd might as well be the man. A Washington dispatch of the lltb states that "19 ' insurgent' congressmen met in the room of Representative Hub bard of lowa and for three hours dis cussed ways and means of forwarding the fight begun at the extra session against the house rules." It is needless to state that Congressman Poindexter was one of the 19. The milk in the cocoanut was let out when a committee was appointed to "map out a plan of action regarding further procedure and presumably to secure democratic sup port in a joint program," and another committee "TO TAKE CARE OF PUB LICITY." To keep before the public, and, if necessary, join forces with the democratic party is a nice little scheme, but. it won't land Mr. Poindexter in the senate from this state. Mr. Poindexter is making it appear more clear every day whpre he "is at"—with the demo cratic party. The humane society of Spokane has undertaken to put a stop to the practice of hitching hors^fl to poatg and leaving them standing uncared for at unseaeon able hours, regardless of the inclement condition of the weather. The law against this practice should be rigidly enforced. There are other places besides Spokane that need law enforcement in this regard. Has a Redeeming Feature. The egotiam of some men can be co easily played upon that they are led into all kinde of foolish situations. Mr. Poindexter, who was the unfortunate choice of the republicans of this district, a year ago for congress, is loping along in this class. Before his seat in congress was fairly warmed he reached the con viction that he was chosen of the gods for leadership, although he accomplished nothing that would carry the same con viction to the public. A number of pre tended admirers—for assuredly no man with any kindly interest in that gentle mau's political future would have ad vanced such a suggestion—induced Mr Poindexter that the people were clamor ing for him to enter the race for the senate, and Mr. Poindexter, a willing listener to the pleasing voices of the sirens, has announced his candidacy for that position. The redeeming feature of this action is that by the retirement of Vfr. Poindexter from the lower house some man can be sent to congress from this district who will pay more attention to working for bis conatuency than for his own advancement. When Mr. Poin dexter comes to next fall he will probably remark to his stenographer, " Mark but my fall, and that, that ruin'd me. Mabel, I charge thee, fliDg away ambition." Or words to that effect.—Oroville Gazette Fool Concessions. As soon as the duty was removed from hides, the dealers abroad who control the market at once advanced their prices a sufficient amount to offset the reduc tion in the duty. The actual effect, there fore, of free hides up to date has been the transference of the money which has heretofore gone into the United States treasury in customs duties to the bank accounts of the foreign dealers in hides, while the buyer of shoes is to pay an average of sixteen cents a pair more for his shoes than he did before the duty was taken off. This is one way in which the importing interests hypnotized the con gress into legislating solely in the in terests of foreigners and has soaked the "ultimate consumer" as well as the cat tle grower in this country. A few more fool concessions of that kind at the in stigation of the importing low tariff in terests will put a number of American industries out of business.—Bay City National Farmer. Deafness Cannot be Cured by local applications, its they cannot reach the diseased portion of the ear. There is only one way to cure deafnenß, and that is by con stitutional remedies. Deafness is caused by an inflamed condition of the mucous linings of the Eustachian Tube. When this tube is inflamed you have a rumbling sound or imperfect hear ing, and when it is entirely closed, Deafness is the result,and unless the inflammation can be taken out and this tube restored to its normal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever; nine cases out of ten are caused by Catarrh, which is nothing but an inflamed condition of the mucous surfaces. We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case of Deafness (caused by Catarrh) that can not be cured by Hall's Catarrh Cure. Send for circular free. F. J. CHENEY & CO., Toledo, Ohio.

Physician Who Tried to Improve High- way Served With Injunction. Widespread interest has been created in good roadfl circles in the case of Dr. . Donald McCaskey of Witmer. Pa., who ! has been restrained from making fur ther improvements to the Witmer road,, a much traveled thoroughfare of East Lampeter township. The physician, after failing to get the road supervisors of his local township to fix a dangerous and ankept half mile of yellow clay roadway, in des peration and at his own expense be gan to make repairs to the road him self. The doctor built King road drags and hired horses from farmers through out the community who would rent them, and, not being able to induce anybody to repair the road for him, the physician drove the team and rode the drag himself. Occasionally a small buy was taken along to stand on the drag for ballast. After fifteen hours of strenuous la bor distributed over a period of six to eight weeks after each rain the neg lected byroad was transformed into a substantial highway. All that was used was the simple wooden instru ment termed the split log drag, which can be made by any farmer out of a log or a few boards. The physician's efforts worked such a transformation in the minds of the incredulous inhabitants of his com munity that the road drag met with popular favor, and the road officials began to be critically censured for their alleged indisposition to fultill the duties of their official office. They promptly secured an injunction restraining the physician from doing any more work of the kind, alleging that he had done this work "to the injury of the road at times and to the inconvenience of the traveling public." The case is still before the courts. Good Roads as Memorials. W. W. Mitchell, one of the men of means at Cadillac. Mich., has offered a bonus, said to be as much as $300. for each mile of good road constructed in Wexford county in the next three years. Presumably one of the princi pal highways leading into the county seat will be known as the Mitchell road. Whether it is or not, the aid given in the creation of a county sys tem of improved highways will cause Mr. Mitchell to be hold in grateful re membrance by future users of the roads. State Supports Good Road Cause. The state of Rhode Island has taken in about (43.000 so far this year for automobile registrations. The money goes into the fund for repair and main tenance of roads. Good Highways In Cuba. General Carlos Garcia-Velez, minister from Cuba to the United States, says that Cuba has 1.300 miles of the most excellent macadam roadg constructed of cruslK'd coral.
