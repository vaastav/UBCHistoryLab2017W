BAKER BACKS HOOVER IN FOOD THRWT PLEA Secretary and Administrator Address Ohio Corn Contest Party. The shadow of insufficient food s'upply is over the face of the earth," said Secretary of War Baker in an address last night to one thousand Idhloans. mostly boys and girls of the Ohio corn contest tour, in the First Presbyterian Church. He gave this warning following an address of sImi lar tenor by herbert C. Hoover, United States Food Administrator. Referring to the honor the girls and boys had had in shaking hands with the President, Secretary Baker said: "President Wilson is the greatest himan moral force abroad in the world today." "The hope of increased harvests has passed.' Mr. Hoover said: 'Our only hope now is the reduction of consumption so as to get through this winter. Each individual will have to live on 60 per cent of the food he would eat normaliy. "We used to feed 20.000.000 persons In, Europe with our grain surplus before the war; nokr we must feed 1i.0ooo -and our own supply Is such that every grain of wheat for our allies now must come from what we car save by reducing our own consump tion. tUnless we feed their women anc children, we can't expect the allies io maintain their battle lines: and their hattie lines are our first line oi defense." Mr. Hoover urged the Ohio touristJ to champion corn as a substitute fol other breadstuff. Other speakers were Senatos Harding. of Ohio, and Dean Vivian of the Agricultural College of th4 State University of Ohio. TwJby-Three Iceberg * Stirs Wiscansimnt-. To Polar Exploration Bayfleld.

After the election of officers a re ception was held in honor of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army and officers of the General Staff, at the conclusion of which the speaker of the evening delivered his address. Referring to the war of the rebel lion, in which the United States in Its divided po..tion has placed mil lions of men on the field of battle almost without preparation of any kind, an achievement which the speaker declared was a studendous military feat, Lieut. Col. Applin said it might seem audacious for him to make any suggestions in view of sucu an accomplishment, especially since America today is united and capable of accomplishing four-fold what was done during the civil war in sending soldiers to the front. Praises American Seldiers. Finer material than the American soldier does not exist In France to day. the British offcer declared, and he did not except the Canadians, Aus tralians, Nvw Zealanders or any oth ers of Britain's colonial subjects. From what he had seen at Camp Meade and other posts, he felt sure that before the violets bloom again American soldiers would be "over there" in sufficient numbers to take up the burdens of war. He said at first he hesitated to come to America, but when he did and found he was among his own people, he hoped every Englishman would come here and every American would go to Eng land, where there was certain to spring up a bond of everlasting friendship. SANDALS IN V06UE AMONGPARISIENNES Special Stockings so Fastenings May Pass Between Toes. Paris. Der. 4.-The all-important question of footgear has been solved by the fashionable Parisienne. In stead of the high-reaching boots "a Ia russe," she has decided to adopt the classic sandals. The fashion was started by a well known shoemaker of the Place Ven dome and already he has so many orders that he has difficulty in sup plying them. Sandals were the fash ion in Paris during the Directoire, when the "Merveilleuses" vied with one another in exhibiting their dainty feet and ankles. regardless of the temperature. But such drastic conditions are not imposed by the new fashion. for a spe cial form of stocking, which makes It possible to pass the attaching rib bons between the toes, is a feature of the new style. Though ostensibly in vented to economize shoe leather. the "mode des sandales" is reserved for those whose pocketbooks have not suf fered from the war, for the economy is not for the wearers or those whc pay the bills.
