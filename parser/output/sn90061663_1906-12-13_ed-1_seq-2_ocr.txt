FILLING UP THE CANADIAN WEST. The American Settler Is Welcomed to Canada. A number of the lenrtlnn newspa pers on this side of tho line have been noticing the growth of tho Canadian West In recent years, atid draw atten tion lo tho fact that there seems to be no abatement of the Influx of settlera to that great grain growing country. Tho Iiuffalo I.'xpress thus refers to the subject ; "Canada West continues to grow There wera 4,171 homesteads rr.triea there In July of this year, as against 8,071 In July, 1003. Canada Mumes herself over this fact, with becoming pride. Put what appear to make our neighbors happiest is the statement that of these 4.174 homesteaders. 1,212 were from this eldo of the line. . Little In sail about tho 87 Canadians who rerrossed the border to tal;o nn homes in Canada West, or of the 808 from Great Britain, or of the 1'3 from non Itritish countries. It ap pears that the item ln this July report that makes Canada rejoice most Is this of tho 1.212 American farmers who decided to try their fortune in Canada West. The compliment ! deserve !. Tfc 1.212 were mostly from Dakota and other farming states, and go Into Canada fitted better than any other class of Immigrants for developing the new country. They take capital with, them, too, say Canadian papers proud- in every way, they are welcome- over there."
