PRICE FIVE CENTS Free State Executes 2 Rebels as Reprisal for Killing of Hales / — ' New Irish Government Lays Heavy Hand Upon Irregulars Following Assassination of Dail Member; Insurgents Caught During Four Courts Raid; Labor Members Are Stirred. Dublin, Dec. 8.—(By The Associated Press.)—The hand of the Free State government fell heaTily Friday upon four more recalcitrant republicans. Roderick (Rory) O'Connor, and "General" Liain Mellowes, two noted leaders of the irreconcilables, and Jo seph McKelvey and Richard Barrett, lesser lights in the fight against the constituted authority, were executed in Mount Joy prison at 9:20 o'clock Friday morning, under the decree of a court martial hastily summoned to try thein Thursday night. The official report issued after the executions said the men had been put. to death as a reprisal for the assassi nation in Dublin on Thursday morning of Sean Ilales. a member of the dail, and "as a solemn warning to those associated with them in the conspiracy of assassination against representatives of the Irish people." No official account of how the men met their doom lias been forthcoming, but it is possible they were hanged, as it is reported O'Connor had to be as sisted to the scaffold. Three priests were present to give the men religious consolation before they died. Caught at Four Courts. All four men were captured when ! the Four Courts building, which had i been seized by the republicans, was 1 taken by the government after heavy j fighting last June. O'Connor and Mel- i lowes were two of the prime leaders j in th* 1 seizure and barricading of the ; building and holding it for days against : the government forces. Tiie execution of the four men, ad- • mittedly as a reprisal for the assassi nation of Mr. Hales, shocked Dublin less by reason of the deaths of men who had helped to carry on the armed ! revolt than because of the announce- j ment that they had been executed in reprisal. Although many friends of the gov ernment express the fear that its new policy of quick action against, male factors will only aggravate the situa tion, madden the republicans and bring about a state of absolute anarchy the Free State parliament.

Chicago, Dec. 8.—Two girls from the little Iowa village of Eddyville Fri day won the national canning contest held in connection with the Interna tional Livestock exposition. They are Buehlah Rodger and Katherine Dola baugh, and will receive a three months tour of Europe as a reward. The Colorado entrants, Elaine Hen dricks and Bertha Boger, won second place, while the Connecticut team mem bers were named as alternates. The contestants represented prac tically every state. The contest was held under the auspices of the Ameri can Committee for Devastated France. Championship awards in the various classes of cattle, horses, sheep and swine continued to occupy the atten tion of the judges at the twenty-third annual livestock exposition. Haidas Optimist, entered by H. C. Cr.off, of Anthony, Kans., was ad judged the grand champion bull of the breeding Galloways. The University of Wisconsin exhib ited the champion wether among grades and cross-breeds of the sheep division and the Shepherds', prize for the best fitted and trimmed flock of three American ewes was won by Joe Mum ford. of Cooperstown, N. Y. The grand champion female of the breeding Aberdeen-Angus division is Pride Prçtest, owned by Escher and Ryan, of Erwin, Iowa. The grand champion boar of the breeding spotted Poland China family, was displayed by R. Iv. Beam and son, Ansonia, Ohio, while the grand champion sow is the property of Adam Ault, Rockford, Ohio. Canada seemed to have triumphed in the bay and grain exposition. In this department, the dominion took not only the majority of first prizes in the classes in which it en tered. but carried off the sweepstakes in wheat and oats, the two classes having the largest entries. The first was won by It. C. Wyler of Luseland. Sask., on a sample of hard red spring wheat and the second by J. W. Biglands of Laeombe, Alla. Besides this, first place was won in two classes which have no sweep stakes but. in which the blue ribbon amounts to practically the same thing, rye and barley. John W. Lucas, of Cayley, Alta.. took the rye laurels, while Jack Taitiner of Claresholin, won in barley. Never before in the history of the exposition, according to stockmen, hns the uniform quality and finish of ani mals been so well matured as in 1022 and never before, have there been so many carloads of extra quality cattle shown. j I ; ! ! i 1 j i j ; : • ! j , , . ^ Cession w members of the dail erieann at Friday afternoon's session.

Judge It. S. Lovett, chairman of the board of the Lniun Pacific, and II. M. j Adam«, its vice president, opposed thei petition of the Southern Pacific, urging that the commission use powers con- j ferred on it by the transportation act. , to bring about general railroad consoli- j dation to keep the Central Pacifi under its present control, and F. M. Finch, general superintendent of the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navi gation company, testified on the prac ticability of joint, use of tracks and facilities by the two roads contemplat ed in the supreme court's separation decree. The Union Pacific, Judge Lovett said, was willing to buy the Central system, but was not seeking to do so. He declared large expenditures made through "many agencies" by his com pany to influence public sentiment to support the separation decree were justified by n sort of "war" between the Union and the Southern Pacific systems over the Central property. As a financial officer of railroad organiza tions. he expressed the opinion that separation of the two roads would en tail no monetary results and that the Central company was capable of earn ing its own way. Sir. Adams attacked the Southern Pacific at length, declaring that because it possessed its own transcontinental line via El Paso, it always would seek to divert transcontinental shipments from the Central Pacific to- avoid divid ing earnings on the northern route with the Union Pacific or other roads.
