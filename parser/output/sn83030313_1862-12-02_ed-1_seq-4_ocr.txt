Skirmishes and re connoi?sances are, of course, of daily occurrence. That of (tencrnl Stahl, from General SigelV corps In the direction of Snieker's Ferry, is but one ex ample of the activity of our troops?particularly the cavaln nun of the service?in expeditions of ties kind. The information which he obtained re lative to the position of the enemy was all im portant, while the valor displayed by liis troops was worthy of every commendation. The President's Message to ('< ngress, w liieli we give to-day, is not perhaps as explicit upon the HM'ije t of tlie war, its issues and its prospects, as the put.lie probably expected. Upon al! the de tails ol our national troubles which are involved in the war question, however, the Message is elaborate, sometimes forcible, and throughout consistent with the previously expressed views of the Presi-b-.it on the matter of slavery and ?mancipation. V e have had a fight in the Southwest. The Is experienced a severe defeat at Cone Hill, ^kansa", a? we learn from the official de^pot-be? General Curt'R, dated from St. Louis and T^tringfield, Missouri, on the 20th. That General Want, with five thousand Union troops, attacked and routed eight thousand rebels under General KTnrmadtike on the 20th instant. Sixty rebels were hilled in the engagement, and the balance were driven some twelve miles. General Blunt telegraphs that the rebels will not probably ven ture north of the Boston Mountains again this winter: and as they have consumed all the sub sistence in the valley of the Arkansas they must soon retreat into Texas. The Hibernian, off Cape Race, forwards new" from Europe to the 21st ult., five days later. Notices posted at Lloyd's. London, report a rumor that another Anglo-rebel steamer had left Liverpool to prey on the commerce of the United States on the ocean, and that a third one (in cluding the Alabama) was about to follow soon. A report to the effect that Secretary Seward had addressed the British government in a tone of displeasure, on the subject of aid alleged to have been given to the Alabama, caused some uncasi* ness on the London Stock Exchange. Tha Loudon Timet aays that Mr. Seward may have takcu that position, in the "desperate hope" of Anding a oause of "external quarrel at any coat, in order to avert impending events at home." The I,ondon Timet ridicules the political tilt be tween Caaaius M. Clay and George F. Train, at the Aoademy of Mnaic, in ita nsnal style. COH 

GBES8. The second session of the Tbirty-aeventh Con gress was opened at noon yesterday. Prayers were delivered by the Chaplains of both honses. After the nsnal preliminaries, the President's Message was received and read.

In the House the Naval Committee were instruc ted to inquire and report as to tbe^heupest, most expeditious and reliable mode of placing vessels of war on Lake Ontario, and establishing water communication with the other lakes, with a view to the protection of the Northern frontier in eases t?f emergency. Mr. Vallandigham, of #hio, offered a resolution, which was adogtcd. instrncting the Jndicisry Committee to inquire and report by what authority of the constitution or the laws, if any, the Postmaster General undertakes to decide what newspapers may and what may not be trans knitted through the mails. Mr. Cox, of Ohio, of fered a preamble and reeolution aetting forth the tket of the illegal arrest and confinement of per sons in military prisons ami camps, and declaring that "the House of Representatives do hcieby tondemh all such arrests and practices as nnwar kqpud by the constitution and-laws of the United pSkM, as a usurpation of power never given up by Ihlittnte their rulers, and do hereby demand that all such arrests shall hereafter cease, and thai nil i Sr.'.'kj CT -icaatci and vet held vLill 1 prompt and publio trial aocording to the provi sion? of the constitution and the lawa of the United States,'' On motion of Mr. Colfax, of Indiana, this was laid on the table by a vote of eighty against forty. Mr. Richardson, of Illinois, offered a resolution requesting the President to inform the House what citizens of Illinois are now in con finement as state prisoners, what charges are against them, by whom the charges are made, and by whose order such arrests were made. Mr. Lovejov moved to lay the resolution on the tat>le. and the motion was adopted by a vote of seventy-four against forty. Notice was given of a bill to increase the revenue by a reduction of the tax on whiskey to five cents per gallon. The Pre sident's Message and the.accompanying document? were referred to the Committee of the Whole, anil ordered to be printed. The House then adjourned. 

MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. The steamship Hibernian, from Londonderry on the 21st of November, passed Cape Pace la-t Ha turday evening on her voyage to Portland.

Judge* Usher, w ho was sent out to Minnesota, as* has been supposed with power to free the Sioux Indians who have been condemned to death, states 'hat lie Las no such authority. He says that he was in the Cabinet meeting w hen General Pope's despatch soliciting the sanction ot the govern ment to hang three hundred of the -e Indians wa jaid be fore the President;.that there was no discus sion about it, while both the President and Secreta ry Stanton expressly agreed that hanging we? the remedy, and sent a despatch ordering General Pope to forward the names of the condemned parties. The New York canals ore yet free from ice and open to navigation. The City Inspector's report states that there were 352 deaths in the city during the past week? an incecaae of 39 as compared with the mortality of the week previous, and 20 more than occurred during the corresponding week las! year.

Notwithstanding the efficiency of llaws as a finance officer, an 1 the efforts of some of our wealthy men in his behalf, there Is every prospect that Brennan will cottie out oflho race far ahead. Numerous tricks have been resorted to for the purpose of cutting down the enormous ma jority that John E.

Slavery The second regular annual Message of P resi dent Lincoln to the two hooaoe of Congress is be fore our reader*. Embracing the official history of the uiost eventful, the moet momentous and the most Critical period of twelve months in the an nals of the United States, and comprehending a variety of legislative recommendations calcu lated to meet the publio necessities resulting from this stupendous domeetio war. and looking to the paramount object of the restoration of the Union, the surpassing Interest and import ance of this Message will be universally recog nized? And yet. upon its first appearance here there appeared to be no public curiosity or in terest in it, but a prevailing anxiety to hear the latest newB from the army of General Burn side, before which even tho President's Message became a secondary question. This Message is a very remarkable docu ment. It is marked throughout by the cha rnoteristic simplicity of style and honest and earnest patriotism which distinguish all the official produc tions of its author. If his views arc presented often in the shape rough diamonds, they are none the less dia monds because of their roughness. The great question to be considered is, how far docs this Mossage meet the exigencies of the day. the de man Is of the country and its hopes of a restora tion of the Union through the measures of this administration? In the outset we are assured that if '-the con* dltion of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually beon at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have apprehended.'' This is a gratifying fact; and, from the conciliatory and magnanimous foreign policy indicated by the President in every instance of complaint of wrong* committed in the progress of this war against the flag or subjects of a foreign Power we derive the conviction that every just cause of offence will continue to be avoided. Thus far. then, we are secured against European intervention. Upon the all-important subject of the nation al finances, the most prominent feature of the Message i- the proposition for - the organiza tion of bauking associations under, a general act of Congress." to be furnished by the government with - circulating notes on the security of United States bonds deposited in the Treasury." In other words, Mr. Lincoln pro* poses the adoption by the federal government of the New York banking system, which expe rience hat proved to be an excellent one : and bis argument in support of it i- entitled to tho practical consideration of Congress, Mean time the condition of the Treasury h better, and Its expenditures for the la1-! fiscal year were much less, than has been generally conjectured. There has " been a decided improvement in the financial condition of tho Post Office Depart ment, compared with several preceding year?." and the explanations of this improvement arc exceedingly interesting. The record of the operations of tho war is left bv the Mos-age with the head of the War and Navy Department", and to thoir reports we would refer the French government for infor mation which it appear.- to need : for, in iio late correspondence with England proposing mediation, this war is represented to be in about the same condition that it wn= a year ago 1 But the slavery question is the great topic oj the Message. Mr. Lincoln appears to have ru. zeed all other subjects to the smallest pos-ibie dimensions, in order to have '-ample so >pe and verge enough" for his elaborate argument in support of the new compromise which he pro. pose;* for the slavery question, lie puts it in 1 the shape of a motion for an amendment of the federal constitution,_providing for the extinc tion of slavery by the year l?on within the limits of the Union, and by the slave latate? themselves, respectively, their slaves emancl pated in the interval to the year li'Oii to hi- paid lor by the f' deral government. Mr. Lincoln's views upon this subject cannot fail to convince the reader that he is actuated by the most pa triotic, huinnne. just and generous considera tions; but we fear that the abolition radicals of Congress will tr?-at his proposition and Im pleading.1- with indifference, if not with scorn and contempt. That they should be told by Abraham Lincoln to wait for thirty seven years for the abolition of Southern slavery, and be told tbi> upon the heels of his emancipation proclamation, is certainly very wonderful. Hut. then, he savs that this new scheme of emancipation "is recom mended. not out that a restoration of the na. tionnl authority would he accepted without its adoption, nor will the war or proceedings" under the emancipation proclamation "be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan;" b\it still Mr Lincolu pleads lor this "plan" as ir it were the only sal ration for the Union. Our plan would be to settle first with the armed forces of this rebellion, and then, with the restoration of the rebellious .Status to the Union, leave to them, each State for itself, the settlement of the slavery question. We should, however, not be without hope of the success of the President s plau if tho party in Congrc * identified with his administration could be lifted up to his platform of patriotism. As it is, our only hope is fu a vigorous prosecution of the war now, while wc have the superior power in the field, and the inferior forces of the enemy within striking distance. Upon this Bttb teot the Message is somewhst cloudy: but. if its numerous practical recommendations sbull be adopted by Congress, we doubt not that their wisdom will be proved by their good re sults to the country Om Citt LavMLATraa.?One-half of the Hoard of Aldermen and an entire Board of Councilineu are to be chosen by the people of this city to-day. Our citizens hare therefore an excellent opportunity to improve the class or their representatives at the City Hall; and. Heaven knows, an improvement is greatly needed. The property holders and taxpayers of this elty have heretofore paid too little atten. tlon to tba selection of these men; but the pre sent timo furnishes an excellent opportunity to inaugurate a reform. If they will only scruti nize carefully the candidates for Aldermen they Will find in almost every district men In nomi nation who will be found all the time opposed to tho swindles of the corrupt Ring, and who will protect the interests of the taxpayers of this city and co operate with other officials in reducing the expenditures of the city govern ment. As they have the voting of the money, it is all important that men are elected who vflll effectually destroy the unholy and expensive combination in that branch of the city govern ment. We true! that this important duty will vbe perform** at the poll* to-day. **? Ofblai Vfm lUUa Af fairs. We have received, but here flot sp^ce to publish iu full, the very interesting report Commissioner William P. Dole to the Seci clary of the Interior upou Indian Affairs. The report, with iu accompanying documents, treats of the present condition of most of the Indian na tions and tribes within our borders, their waril, and prospects, and their advancement" in civi lization, as well as the operations of tha va rious superintendents and agents of the govern] uienl located among them. Commissioner Dole Bays that the policy re cently adopted of confining the Indians to reser vations, and from time to time allotting public land* to them, is the be*t method yet devised lor reclaiming theui to civilization. The chief difficulties which attend thi* plan arise from th? contact of the white and red races. Whore the Indian reservations are surrounded by white i?etilc;ucuts. ths icd men are regarded a? in truders, subjected to insults and annoyances, and exposed to the grasping cupidity Of their ! white neighbors, who Se'-m to forget that the ia trusion Is all on their own side. Compelled to abandon all their former modes of guiuing a livelihood, adopting pursuits with which they are totally unacquainted, brought inte compe tition with their superiors in education and in telligence, amenable to local aud federal laws which to them are almost unintelligible, obliged | to submit to long and cruel delays if they are wronged, swiftly and sevorely puni bed if they commit crimes?many of the Indians cannot be induced to see any hope in tho future, or to abaudou their vicious and idle habits. That a largo number of them are acquiring tho habits and the arts of civilization is no less gratifying than wonderful. Greater unanimity between the federal government and the 1 governments of those States within which In dians are located, and a more generous State legislation, by which the disabilities under i u hi eh the Indians now labor may be gradually ' removed and the free rights of citizenship conferred, are suggested as strong incentives to impiovemenl not likely to full ol beneficial effects. Commissioner Dole thinks tho condition of the California Indians one of peculiar hardship. Previous to the white immigration the Indians of California were free, content ni and happy, j nature supplying all their wants with her pro- I fuse abundance. When the white immigration began the whole State was suon overrun, and the Indians were di.->po*se*ed of their homes, their hunting grounds ami their l<-herie.?, and were at once reduced to the most abject depen dence. Now they have no means of subsist ence, no treaty wuii 01 recognized claim upon the United iStaies government, no place to which to migrato^aud are forced to become I vagabonds, to steal or to starve. Upon dis honest and dishonorable pretexts the whites invade even tho. scanty reservations aet apart for the use of these i^or people, and there is literally no place in California where the Indian can live iu safety and security. A? a remedy lot this state of n'Tairs Commissioner Dole recommends the government to recognize the Indians' usufructuary right iu the soil, and ti'-at wi'h them for the extinguishment of thii right, and the establishment of the oume system in oiir management of the Indians in Califoi'ii'a as in other States and in the Territories. In regard to tho Indians of the Southern super iritendeucy, Commissioner Dole Mates that the robellmn cut oil almost all (fominunication with this portion of bis charge. It was always be lieved, and has recently been demonstutcd, however, thai a strong I nion sentiment o.x'M-'d among rhe?e Southern Indians. In no part of the country have greater sufferings and p rjra tions been endured and graat?r sacrifices boon insile for loyalty - -.ike. The rebels early <-n deavoml to -od ice these Indians from their al legiance. and. a- tho Indian agents first appoint ed by the j t -eat administration *oon turned traitors, the eiTort was partially successful Every means -an* resorted to and all sort* of extravagant stories told to mislead these Tn_ dians: and the withdrawal of o n troops and ihe interruption of communication gave pl.i;i"ibilitv to the secession inventions. The Indians soon divided info loyalists and serosskuiist-. and. the lattei party aswiming the aggressive! there w is an appeal to arms. Iu December last considerable 1 forces of the Creeks. Seminole* and representa tives of all the other tribes, except the Choctaw* ' and Chickasaw*, met twice in battle, aud in both ! conflict* the loyalists were successful. About that time the War Department ordered Major General Hunter to send a force of four thousand loyal Indians into the Indian Tcrrito- i ry to enforce the authority of the go\ eminent, j Cotiitnbdoner Dole went out to Kan-n* to a**i<t I Hunter, and learned that in a third battle, the loyal Indians had been defeated by tue rebel-, who had been strongly *-einforced from Texas. It would be impossible to give nn adequate idea of the sufferings endured by thoie loyal people i after this defeat and before theii arrival on the Southern border of Kansas, where thev were J immediately relieved by General Hunter One hundred and forty of the Creek.- died of uxpoMtre and want, nnd over one hundred frosted limbs were amputated within two week* after .they reached Kansas. In consequence of causes not yet fully understood, the expedition to reinstate these Indian* in their homos did not set out until the 1st of Jnly last, then only penetrated a* fur as Talequah, nnd soon retreated, on ac count of difficulties between the officers of the white regiments detailed by General TIalleck to accompany the Indians. The Union senti ment still existing among the inhabitants of the Indian country was manifested by the enlist ment of a regiment of Cherokee*, still in the United States service. Ten thousand destitute Indian men. women and children are now sub sisted by the government in the south of Kan sas. Another campaign ia now in progress to restore these fugitive* to their home*. The ex pense Incuired In aiding the refugees ha* bton paid from the annuities withheld from -eces*lon tribes; but additional legislation is necessarv in regard to the matter, and Commissioner Dole hopes that it will be most generous and ample. During moat of the past year that portion of the superhi tendency of New Mexico known as Ari zona has been occupied by the rebels, The Indian tribes in Arizona are the Apaches and the Plneoa. Papagos and Maricopas. known un der the general name of Pueblos. These Pue blos tribes are more than half civilized and unquestionably loyal. They stand as a barrier between the wbito settlements and the wild Indiana. So greatly are they trusted that gov eminent has supplied them with one hundred muskets and ten thousand rounds of ammuni tion. They are agriculturalists, and raised one million pounds of wheat Ust year. In a very abort time they will be quite able to take oarq af tbemaalven. The Aoaohes. .. are wild, hostile ?? he contmry, . Hbtw thii ?wa barbarous. The Nav^,- are, bed character. These two trlbcc scourges of New Mexico. Comraiaaiener t'V, ; rece^MHeuds that these marauders (should ^ ' immediately restrained and punished Orogon Indiana are peaceful and improving; but i new treaties should be made with thorn without delay. In t!ie Central Supc-rintei.deney the Sioux end Pawnees have bad a hostile encounter during-the year just passed; but with this ex ception all the tribes have been at peace. Their loyalty is undoubted. Out of two hundred aud one able bodied Delaware? one hunduxi and seventy have volunteered for militffy service. The Pottowuttomies and . Pslawares are especially ad van rod in civiliza tion. Lauds have recently been allotted to the femes, Foxes and Kaws, and allotmonts will soon be made to such members of tho Pottowat tomie.- and Otawu* as may desire thein. This step?the individual ownership of land?Gom Diisaioner Dtfle regards as great progress to wards civilization. Ia order to get rid of the pernicious influences of vicious whites, Mr Dole suggests that the various tribes be removed to the Indian country south of Kansas. Those In dians who object to thus plan should be allowed to remain on their present freeholds, however Tho recent Sioux outrages iu Minnesota are ad verted to: but Commissioner hole cannot accu rately indicate the onuses of these outbreak*. Ho thinks, however, that the deduction from their annuities of the damages impo-ed upon the indiaus for depredations upon white cottiers has had a great deal to do with tho trouble. Mr. Dole objects to several portions of the form of a treaty negotiated with the Indians by the Governor of Minnesota, and protests agaiust the gross wrong and impolicy of executing the con demned Indians by wholesale, on the ground that, although the Indians have behaved atro ciously and the white settlers are justly in censed. still indiscriminate puui-hment will re sult disastrously, and partakes more of the character of revenge than of justice. He re commends that-a line of forts be erected along the Rsd liver of the North, and that the Chip pewas of the North be sent thither. Ho is not in favor of expelling the Winnebago? from Min nesota because a few of theii brave? aided the Sioux: but he think? that they might be readily removed to the Northwest. At the close of his ter?e and well written report Commissioner Dole urge- Congress to make appropriations to recompense tho white settlors lor the depreda" tious eoiumitied by the Indians; and this stiu gestion. as well as several others already named, we most willing! 7 endorse. The Report of the K?v? Dtpmtnient. The report of Secretary Welles, presented yesterday to Congress Is a State papei lii^ dj creditable to the Ameiicaa people, hut rede-.ts little credit upon the Secretary himself From iiia own showing the nation is everything and lie is nothing?a mere cipher, an old fogy, in cotnpetei.t to direct the magnificent force* placed in h:s hands by the spontaneous enthu siasm of the country. l out powerful squadrons have been called into existence, sufficient to guard the entire sweep ot our Atlantic and Gulf coast, from the mouth of the Chesapeake to the mouth of the Rio Grande. The West India i-lcuds in the possession of Use Bri tish government give peculiar facilities to English vessels to run the blockade: and yet Mich is the risk that it has become h.losing con cern, and at least one speculator in England has been broken by it. Itut with such a force wider his direction the Secretary of the Navy ought not to lllow a single breach of the block" ad'- and be juglit to have swept the Southern piivat<H"s from the ocean. lb" Nashville, the Swoter. the Alabama and o.her ves-el# in the : dad ">erv ice have committed tremendous de predation- on American commerce, notwith standing the enormous naval force at the dis posal of the Secretary of the Navy Aiiuiu: New Orleans. Memphis. Galveston. Port Royal. Forts Pulaski. Macon. .Jackson, St* Philip. Henry. Don<dson and Pillow have been captured, hut the-a victories, though brilliant a. d glorious have not been decisive The de cisive point- of the war Secretary Welle- ba< permitted to slip through his fingers. He did not render the necessary and stipulated aid to General McC'lellan on the James river in the plan to capture Richmond. Hence the humilia tion of our navy in Hampton Roads by th? Merrimar, the paralysis of the operations ot the army, and the final disastrous retreat from the Chleknboiuiny and the James, ami the rout of the army of Pope, the invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania and the narrow escape of Washington. Secretary Welles did not play his part in the programme. lie tailed, us the New York republican papers of yesterday admit that 'he War and Navy Departments have raise, iably failed iu the carrying out of their ro'cs in co operation with Burnside on the Rappahan nock. What avails It to us that we have one hundred and four sailing vessels and three hun dred and twenty three steamers in the navy? amounting to four hundred and twenty-seven in all and mounting thirty-two hundred and sixty eight guns, if there is not some intelligent, ener getic mind to guide their operation*. The Mer rimnc wim permitted to ke*p at bay our whole navy iu defence of the James river till the rebel* accumulated inch an array at Richmond a* it was impossible for MoClellan to resist, with hi* expec ted reinforcements cut off by orders from Washington. The manner in which Secretary Welles glosses over the results of the terror inspired by the rebel steamer is as unique as his claim to the credit of the design of the Monitor, whos* achievement* caused the great rebel steamer to commit suicide. The Monitor was at first a private enterprise, of which Welles no-.er dreamed. He was all the time fast asleep, like Rip Van Winkle, In the famous hollow, while the world ndvanoed twontv years. There is one thing for which tl.e Secretary of the Navv deserve* some credit, and that is that he did not award one of the contracts to New London, In his own State, but to a differ, ent locality. What effect the exposure of the two and a half per cent commission to his brother-in-law Morgan, and his purchase or worthless ships at high prices, may hnv had In bringing hira to this point, we cnnn" determine. But U seem* to be n healtn fnl symptom, mnlnly produced J recent elections, like some other indlcations> in the document* laid before Congress yesterday by other servants of the peopt*. On the whole we come to the conclusion that the report of the Secretary of the Navy is the moat decisive testimony *ver borne to ?hec^und naval resource* of a great peoplewhile, oy the oontrast of the meaus at bis dUposaV and tba poor results produced, the official himself is an of \h<j smallest men wbg jirer oq?u?;|$ a sJuJ Jm position fn the gftrefnment.

Secretory of the Interior^ ? \ The space occupied bj the President's ftes? sago obliges us to oonfine ourselves to a brief notic? of the report of the Secretary of the luteiior. It is the less necessary to give this document in full, seeing that its leading points are disposed of in the important" oxtraots from tba report of the Commissioner of the Land Office, which "will be found elsewhere. In regard to the operations of the Laud Office for the last year the results may be thus briefly summed up:?As was to be expect ed from the protraction of the war, the demand for the public lands has steadily continued to decline. From the :tOth of September, 1801, to the 30th of September, 1862, there have been surveyed 8,135,067.41 acres. Of these there have been sold for cash during the fiscal year ending .Tune 30, 1862, and the first quarter of the current fiscal year, only 154,258.65 ucrear producing $137,476 26. During the same pe riod there have been located with bounty land warrants 712,055.77 acres; 1,133,808.02 acres have been certified under railroad grants made by Congress, and 24,816.09 acres have been ceilified to different States as swump lands, making the aggregate thus disposed of 2,024,529.43 acres, and leaving of surveyed lands ready for sale on the 30th of September. 1862, 135,328,808.64 acres. The outstanding and unsatisfied bounty warrants under the laws of 1847, 1850, 1852 and 1855, at the same date, wore 65,913, covering 7,128,380 acres. Referring to the immense development that has taken place in the mineral resources of tba country, as shown by the report of the Land Commissioner, Secretary Smith savs that, after extensive inquiry from, all available ?sources of information, the production of gold during the present year from the auriferous region which embraces Daeotnh, Nebraska C olorado, New Mexico, Arizona. Utah. Nevada California. Oregon and Washington, may be set down at one hundred millions. If an amount of labor relatively equal to that expended in California had been applied to the gold fields already known to exist outside that Stute. it is believed that the production of this year, including that of California, would have exceeded four hundred millions. The ?Secretary thinks that these vast mines of wealth may be made available to aid in liqui dating our national debt. Of the several modes suggested for making these land, productive to the government he specifies three uz:?The granting of leases by the government.' Ue collection of a certain portion of the pro ceeds of the mines, and the nbaolutc sale of the land in small lots. It has been estimated, he says, that at least $500,000,0(8) could be real i -ed by the sale of the lands in one acre lots, after granting to those who aro now engaged ia mining a clear title, without cost, to tho lands they occupy. The subject is one of transcend ant imj ortance, in view of the enormous in crease Ulut is daily being made to the publio nirthons, ami should at once receive the atten tion of Congress. The report Suggests the necessity of immedi ate legislation in connection with another close oi mineral riches to be found in the public do main?namely. the extensive coal fields known as the Mount Diablo mines, on the Joaquin river, within forty miles of San Francisco. It shows that our steamers on tho Pacific, which are now furnished with coal from Pennsylvania at twenty dollars a ton. can be readily sup. plied from these mines nt twelve It also recommends that that portion of the public lands of Texas, amounting to one hundred mil lions of acres, which remains unsold, and which owing to the treason of its people. U properly subject to confiscation, shall bo declared for feited to the United States, nud placed under the operation of the Homestead law. There ere other important suggestions and recommenda L.h.s in reference to Indian affairs, to which re derote some special remarks ia another column to the providing additional accommodation in' the Patent Office, the appointment of Pension Commissioners, the establishment or a bureau ol statistic- in connection with the Census Office the limitation by Congress of tho f ,?wcr to sum mon more than eighteen grind .,nd twenty-four petit jurors for eac h term of the United State* courts, the creation or a police court for tbw District of Columbia, and the passage of a law by Congress sanctioning the transfer of Washing too prisoners and authorizing tfie confinement m tho penitentiary at Albany, or in some other prison out of the District or Columbia, of nil persons who may be convicted tbpre. until a suitable prison shall be erected. In regard to the publio printing, the report states that the in terest of the government has been greatly pro moted by the adoption of the present mod* o* executing Jt-a resplt that no one doubted ex cept those interested ia perpetuating the old contract system. The Great Eastern.?We are gratified to receive so good a report of the actual condition of the Great Eastern as that which, we publish to-day from Messrs.
