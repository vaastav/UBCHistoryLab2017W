HISTORICAL WORK. A petition is being circulated in Charleston ' requesting the Legislature to pass a law prohibiting racetrack bet ing in South Carolina. Advocates of increased pensions bat tled on the floor of the National House Obituary.. On Saturday night, Nov. 11, the Death Angel visited the home of Rev. and Mrs. J. L. Gale, and their darling little daughter, LalaB., was taken. She was four years of age. ' Lala B. was a bright, sweet child, loved by everyone. But the Lord loved her best. He needed just such a flower in His Garden. Strange that the Lord often plucks the choice ones. I reckon He thought she was too good to live on this troublesome earth, and so she was transplanted to bloom forever in the Garden of Paradise. This dear, sweet one was not at home when she died. Father and mother were called to the home of the little girl's brother at Wlngo, Ky., and while there the little darling fell asleep in the arms of Jesus. Services were conducted by Rev. John Mullins and her sweet babyhood was laid to rest in Obion Cemetery to await the Resurrection Morn. O, how we will miss little Lala B., her smiling face and the dear sweet!

"Something wrong with this item." ''How now?" "Says the bridegroom took his place beneath the floral bell and 2,000 volts were immediately shot through his quivering frame." ' ' The Methodist Bazaar. Last Friday and Saturday.Dec. 10 and 11, the ladies of the Methodist Home Mission Society held a bazaar in the store room formerly occupied by Gar. ner A Bean's Grocery Store. The largo fifont window was beautifully and artis tically decorated and looked like a veri table Santa Claus land. The ladies of the society had responded generously to the call of the president, Mrs. Swiggart, and the fourth vice presideut, Mrs. Cow- den, who has charge of the local work of this kind. The front of the room was given up to the articles for sale, and by Friday night most of them were sold. The candy made by Mrs. Rogers went, literally, liko hot cakes, and she very kindly offered to make more Friday night, ready for Saturday. On Saturday the ladies had a regular Christmas dinner. Roast chicken and dressing were a few 'of the good things, and they quit serving only when the viands were exhausted. One of the most interesting features of the bazaar was the demonstration of Snowflake Lard and Wesson Oil, given by Miss Baker, who travels for the Wesson Oil firm. Five premiums were offered for cakes made with Snowflake Lard, and about eighteen cakes were entered, it being under stood that each cake was to bo donated to the bazaar when they had been judged. The first premium was a half dozen gold-bowled orange spoons from Bransford & Andrews, second, a hatpir. from Mrs. Arnn's, third, 12 pounds of Snowflake Lard from the comnanv. s. Hassier received first prize, Mrs.- Al Alexander, second, Mrs. W. W. Adams, third, Mrs. Ella Cathey, fourth, and Mrs. Wehman, fifth. Miss Baker certainly deserves tho thanks of the society for her efficient help with the dinner on Saturday, bo lides which she took entire charge of the cake salea, turning over to the ladies over $20.00 Saturday afternoon. Alto gether, the society is richer by $130 as a result of the enterprise. The society wants especially to thank Mr. Dietzcl for his kind donation of the building, Mr. Alexander for the lights, and the merchants who so genorously -donated the prizes for the cakes. A Great Opportunity. I see that College Btreet has improved wonderfully. That part east of the col lege is so improved that the wholo town is proud of it. When Mr. Chas. Miles' bungalow on this street is completed much more will be added to the beauty of this section. Concrete sidewalks are being laid around thoso beautiful vacant lots I see advertised for sale on Doc. 16. i These lots, eight in number, ire located at the riunsing of Morgan and East Grover streets, the only vacant lots to be had within the heart of the city. They are midway between the Cumber land, Church of Christ, Methodist and ' Baptist Churches and the college and " library no railroad to cross going to school, no, uneasiness on the part of parents as to the safety of their little children going to and from college. This makes these beautiful lots doubly desirable. This neigh lxrhood is sec ond to none in Union City; not a siuglo undesirable family in this section, and these people desire and are anxious to see residences erected upon the lots to surpass others that are already built. Morgan street has been widened and graded. Concrete walks will bo extend ed from College to Main street, and tho tide of travel will pass along this beauti fully improved part of the city. This is the last opportunity for a fine lot. , 5OO.0O in Diamonds Will Be Given Away Absolutely Free !
