Some of tho negro soldiers went on n rampage similar to that at Ilrowusville, Tes, and one of tbelr number killed a citizen.

FACTORY GOES UP IN SMOKE. Draatle Measares ef Keataekr Aaalaat Tobacco Trast. PMNCETOX, Ky, Dec. 3.-The to bacco stemmeries of John Steger and John G. Orr here, the latter controlled by the Imperial Tobacco company of New York, were destroyed by n Are which was kindled against them by mob of masked men. Several cottages In the vicinity were badly damaged, but nobody was hurt The losa Is es timated at about $170,000. The mob, which numbered about 300 men, entered Princeton between 1 and 2 a. m., seized the town marshal and disarmed him, took charge of the po lice station and the waterworks nnd set fire to the buildings. Even bad the fire company responded they would have been nnable to obtain water. Masked men stood on guard, permit ting nobody to come near until the buildings were completely enveloped In Hames. A squad took charge of the telephone office, and no word of the affair was permitted to go out When the members of the mob saw that the fire was beyond control they left the town, going In the direction of Hopkinsrllle, discharging revolvers and rifles. The fire department then came out, but could only prevent the fire from destroying nearby buildings. The work of the mob is believed to be only n furtherance of the agitation by the tobacco ratsera against the so called tobacco trust early naves HeaSre Tars nnUfcS CRONSTADT.

Y., Dec 3.. Chester E. Gillette probably will know his fate before another day dawns. Tho final scenes In the remarkable trial of the young factory foreman ot Cort land, who is charged with having slain Grace Brown, his sweetheart, will be enacted to-day. District At torney Ward will review the evidence which has been placed befbre the Jury and demand that the prisoner be forced to answer with his life the happenings of that day on Big Moose lake when Grace Brown went to her death. . Gillette's counsel will argue that Miss Brown went to her death a suicide, the result of her own vol untary act. , To-day's session promises to be a long one. The opening of court was delayed for some time, as Judge Devendorf was obliged to open regular term of court before the Gil lette case was resumed. The Judge has said, however, that the lateness of assembling will not be permitted to interfere with the completion of the' case to-day. He baa announced that a night session will be held If necessary to give the attorneys time to conclude their arguments. For mer Senator Mills, Junior counsel for Gillette, will make the final argument for the defense. SI las D. Feeter, a civil engineer, was called by the defense when the trial was resumed to-day. Ho said he had been to South bay, Big Moose lake, within a few days and made measurements at the point where the overturned boat was found "At that place the water is seven and a halt feet deep," he said. Mr Ward objected, because condl tlons are n6t the same now a they were July 1.1, when Grace Brown's death occurred. It had been testified by witnesses for the people that the water was four and n half feet deep where the boat was found and on cross-examination Mr Feeter admit ted that there was a big difference in the water line when he made the soundings and last July, vhn the alleged tragedy took place, "The summer shrubbery that was growing last July Is now covered with water," he said. District Attorney Ward called Ju llan A. Van Wle as his witness Mr Van Wle Is manager of n cycle com pany in Cortland. "I have aeen Chester Gillette sev eral times," he said: "the first time In my place of business." "What was the transaction, If any?" asked Mr Ward. This was objected to. as reopening the people's case, and District At torney Ward did not Insist upon an answer. The objection was sus tained. "The people rest," announced Mr Ward. "Anything for the defense?'! naked Justice Devendorf. "Nothing more," waa the answer. and all was ready for the summing up. Justice Devendorf asked If the counsel wanted to be limited In time for their addresses. "I do not pro pose to limit you unless yon desire It," he said. There was no request for time II m itatlon. Mr Mills began his summing np address for the defense nt f-30. He said: I congratulate yon that this case comes to n close. At last this toung man a mere boy comes 'o a body of men who In law nnd fac' aro his friends. He knows tbst In your minds be will receive Impartial con sideration of bis case. That, be bas not yet bad. From Jnly 14 be bas been opposed by nn almost lrr tlsti ble power., There was the district attorney, who has worked Ms hard est to prosecute and convict thla bov. If nny criticism la to be made nf this officer. It wonld seem to be over teal. The prone en tlon ban been rarrled to the very limit- Mr Mllla referred to DrVt At torney Ward's opening speech, speak ing of the "eye witness of the trag-l edy. promise of marriage ear the wedding clothe. "The opening was n crl'lcal time and some may have gained false Im pressions from these statement, he said.. Bat every and nny fact In fvvor of this boy should have been produced." said Mr Mills. "Altboncb It la not lbs district nttnrney alone wfn bas been against thin boy; the sheriff Is another.' Mr Ward and Sheriff Rkrards bad bnoverlons ln ,newksgCll--Tll. lett nnd In searching for Inrrlminat Ing evidence. Mr Mills asked tbst sperUt atten tion be given to the new-smpers.

"Gentlemen," he continued, "in the law this boy Is Innocent until It Is established he is guilty. In this case there Is a far stronger presump tion one almost satisfying that this boy is Innocent. He hid no bad habits, no rowdyism attended him; but they say he auddenly rose up, de liberated for a week, and comrcitted the terrible crime of murder.' "It appears that this boy had re lations with this young woman, but other men have i overstepped the bounds of propriety. She was 26 years old; he was 23. T'el- rela tions society calls Improper, but they were only natural.- He is not to be punished for that, not convicted for that :"- i .; "The only question is: 'Did this boy on July 11 last, on Big Moose lake, take the life of Grace Brown against the laws of the state?' , You may not favor his relation, but you shall not consider them in arriving at your verdict." Mr Mills started to speak on what he termed a miscarriage ot justice In Vermont, and the district attorney objected. Justice Devendorf ; said that the purpose of a summing up is to review the evidence. ' . , Mr Mills did not press his point. "Think of the proposition that has been shown as an adequate motive for the cruel murder of a Bwjet young girl. He had been in soctety and about with friends. Does thl" o to show that he contemplated the crime of murder? 1 "Had he been about to marry some one, and been embarrassed by a lia- son with another, there might have been a motive. But there was none here." Mr Mills said Gillette had no spe cial attratcion in Cortland, and it would have been an easy matter for him to have gone away. He and Miss Brown simply met, and went away to talk It over, to plan for tha future, and yet they say he killed Grace Brown so he might stay in Cortland. Why, he had not even his parents there."
