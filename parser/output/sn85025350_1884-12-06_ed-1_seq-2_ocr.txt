MINING JOURNAL. FROSTBURG, MARYLAND. Saturday Morning, l>ec. G, IHH4. With more of sorrow than anger we observe a coolness has sprung up between our Cumberland daily brethren—a frigidity which amounts on one side to a confession of real “surprise.” To get the temperature back to a normal average we suggest that the hose of editorial opinion be turned upon themes more conserva tive than bribery allegations and al legators. A qintlehan away up in Maine wants to furnish the Journal with special articles under the heading of “Scientific Miscellany” for a consid eration. We are glad he has done this good thing, but really regret we cannot philosophically accept so long as the question whether the civil ser vice and tenure-of-office laws shall or shall not be repealed. The Jour nal is a solid paper, not much taken up with those computations which show how long it would take the sun to dry up the earth, except so far as evaporation may affect the Cheapeake and Ohio canal and the Frostburg Waterworks. It prefers to smile at the deep, far-reaching stratagems of the prohibitionists rather than at sub divisions of the electric light; or laugh at the rosy effrontery blooming perennially upon B. F. Butler’s cheek than at an artificial aurora borealis. Thb participle, “raising,” is used in many connections, sacred and pro fane. “Raising wheat,” “raising bread,” “raising a blockade,” “raising a house,” “raising the wind,” and “raising children,” are common idioms, the last named incorrectly for rearing. There is also a process de nominated “raising the dickins,” an inferior hyperbole descriptive of cer tain exaltations of the orthodox place of everlasting punishment. But the latest and worst use of this obedient participle is contained in the follow ing paragraph of the President’s message: - All treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated or are in process of negotiation contain a pro vision deemed to be requisite under the clause of the Constitution limiting to the House of Representatives the authority to originate bills for raising revenge. It goes without saying that the Constitution is innocent of imposing the restriction referred to, and the President guiltless of such an unhap py statement of perhaps the most im portant power vested in the House of Representatives. We cannot speak so confidently of the blamelessness of all treaties, for diplomats, like other professional traders, sometimes have old scores to remember. It was none of these; it was the simultaneous compositor and infallible proof-reader oa one Washington and two Cumber land papers—a journalistic conspira cy to spell “revenue” with a “g.” Aiioutu year ago the Journal re ceived for publication an anonymous letter. Its reception was acknowl edged and a statement made to the effect that until the author made himselt known to the Journal the letter would not be published. This “brought the gentleman to his feet,” j so to speak. More than this be ex pressed bis “views” with some energy. Inasmuch as bis letter “contained nothing objectionable lie could see nothing in the reason that it lacked authority to exclude it from publica tion.” At first sight this is plausible. No fact misstated, no unorthodox opinion expressed, nobody hurt, why should newspapers be squeamish about giv ing them circulation ? No reason therefor in the world —but one, viz: To maintain impartially and inflexi bly the “dead line” drawn at the threshhold of all correspondence. On this rock of defence respectable newspapers stand with spontaneous and perfect unanimity. No matter how innocent or inoffensive the mat tor, the author must cortify his ef fusions to the publisher under his personal or autographic endorsement, ! the latter preferred. Thus at one fell swoop the publish- 1 er is protected against utterances not his own. He is moreover saved the trouble of exercising that nice dis crimination, if lie is so endowed, which quickly and infallibly discerns the difference between motives and pretexts. The wisdom of this oft-published newspaper rule was verified last week. . A letter dated at Allegheny city, j Pa., and signed “A Subscriber,” was I received by the Journal. It de- j tailed the unaccountable killing of James P. Murto at that place a few days before and indulged in the cus-, tomary eulogium upon his life and talents. The story was straightfor ward and tolerably well told. It possessed all the seductive character istics of a good news item. For once, however, “distance did not lend en chantment to the view.” The ab sence of the sine qua non —a personal guarantee of the truth of the state ment —was fatal, and the letter was laid aside, at least until more conld be heard concerning the event which it pretended to relate. The next day a paragraph in the Cumberland Xews showed that a similar letter had been received by that paper, which also adjudged it as suspicions. A copy containing the i reference, sent by some one to Mr. | Murto, evoked from that gentleman a letter, published in Wednesday’s is sue, in which he avers a determina- [ tion to ferret out the perpetrator, and the News “hopes lie will catch the chap who is playing these scurvy tricks and punish him at he deserves.” Had the Xeu't published the let ter as scut it might have had to take some of tko medicine prescribed for “the chap.” The long and short of the matter is—no article deserves publication which the author is unwilling to stand by squarely in any event before or after the worst comes to the worst. If he fails here, no quality, however, i bright, should bs permitted to inter pose its brilliance as a shield against j the odium of incorrigible cowardice. Eastern Views of the Coal Trade. New York. —In bituminous coals, as all along, supply is large, prices as low as ever, but undoubtedly present price* are leading to the materially \ enlarged consumption of such coal.— ! Mining Record. The trade moves along quietly, and I thus far no improvement has follow ed the prospect of a stoppage in the Cumberland district. Philadelphia. —The bituminous op erators are living in hopes that the Eastern demand will be considerably augmented, and that their shipments will reach one million tons. 11l spite of the slight encouragement, some three or four tracts will be partially developed, and entries, runs, and sidings put in as preparatory steps to active work, should the market per-1 mit activity. Thecoal men are wait-1 ing on the iron men, and they are j waiting on the railroad builders, and ! the railroad builders are waiting on the country to fill up, Boston. —The announcement of a twenty per cent, reduction in the wages of Cumberland coal miners has relieved the bituminous branch of the market from the monotony into which it had fallen. It raises the possibility of a strike on the oen hand, in case the cut-down goes into effect, it places the Cumberland oper ator on a more even competing basis with his Clearfield neighbor. The price of mining in both regions would then be 40 cents a ton. It lias been 50 cents in the Cumberland re region. This gain of ten cents a ton would go to make up the difference between Baltimore and Philadelphia water freights. If a strika must come, now is a good time for i f . The matter is in uncertainty, but it is be lieved that the cut-down will be ac quiesced in. There is nothing of importance in the way of business. We quote delivered prices $3.55 @53.70. 

GENE 11AL ITE MS . Congress met Monday. The pres | ident’s message,a masterly document, was read, and the two bodies went to work. This, the second session of the ! 48th Congress, expires March 4th. It promises to boa busy one. The electoral colleges met at the j State capitals Wednesday and cast I their several votes for President and Vice-President as appointed by the l people. The result is—Cleveland |and Hendricks 219; Blaine and Logan 182. Up in Quebec they have a project on foot to make a trade with Uncle Sam. They want the forty-fifth parallel of latitude, which is the northern boundary of New York aiid Vermont extended to the Atlantic as the boundary between Canada and the United States. In exchange for this northern tip of Now Hampshire and about one half of the state of : Maine, they offer us the island of Jamaica. A Change.—Last Monday the stockholders of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal company met at Anapolts and elected Col. L. V. Baughman, of Frederick city, president of the canal for one your, vice Lewis Cass Smith, l of Hagerstown. The board of pub | lie works, which is composed of Gov j ernor McLane, Comptroller Turner j and Treasurer Compton, were unan imous for Mr. Baughman, no other name being presented for the place. ! Mr. Baughman, it is understood, will I qualify next Monday, and at one# j enter upon his duties, as will th board of directors. The salary of the president is $3,000 per annum, and

Prof. Tyndall suggests that, just as th soil may be effectual by being robbed of some essential ingredient by one abundant crop as to be in capable of producing another, so in the human system a parasitic disease I may so completely exhaust the blood ! of some ingredient necessary ta the ; growth ttnd propagation of the para , site that the production of a stcond , j crop iu fatal or considerable quantity j may be impossible. It would thus : appear that protective vaccination or | inoculation is simply the intro duction into the blood of weakened and comparatively harmless disease germs to consume the material which might become food for similar germs in a more vigorous and dangerous condition. ADDITIONAL LOCAL. Ilvevltles.- - A copy of the Acts of IS7B, belonging to th# editor, loaned several months ago, has gone astray. For special reasons we would be glad to have it returned. We have a good sized library of other books out also. We remember the wlierabouts of some; Others have passed beyond our ken. For general and equitable reasons wo would be happy to extend all of them a warm “welcome home.” In justice to tho books, however, the “fatted ! calf” will not be killed. This hint is suggested by a disappointment this j week in putting our hand on a val uable volume which was not there, j That book contained information for which wo had immediate and impera tive use. Its failure to show up re minded us that it had been loaned, to whom only incommunicable Om niscience and the borrower know. W# cordially, earnestly and entreat ingly invite the wanderers to return. Hoar “Old Times and New” next Friday eveuisg at Moat’s Opera House. Several of the boys aro in mourning. They tampered with a soap man Mon day. The s. m. relieved five of $5 each and “lit out.” The bereaved ones ar* estimable members of the com munity. Everybody likes them. They 1 aio inconsolable. We have not inter viewed them. The impression is [ abroad, however, that they have preambled and resoluted that they were “overtook” by something which, for the time being, is worse than 40 cents a ton. A bunch of keys found. Come to \ this office. ; A highly esteemed and diserimina | ting subscriber, writing this week to j renew his subscription, takes occasion to say: “I find the Journal to be still an indispensable article.” There aro hundreds of others who put equal value on the same article. Look over our list and you wiil find a great many big lumps of the “salt of tho earth.” Gormanus N. Wright, living on the Walnut Level farm, near this place, this week killed a slioat 9J months old that weighed 401 pounds. Hard to beat, that. _ jM: H.S Pito3l BEYOND TUB FLAT.
