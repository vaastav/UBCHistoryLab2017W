With all due regard for the foresight aLd wisdom of the majority of the Virginia Convention, the determina tion to let the Legislature elect the judges, seems to us the gravest depar ture from Republican principles yet announced by that body. No argument has been advanced in favor of such an election that does not apply with equal force to every other officer in the State. One advocate of the Legislature's electing the judiciary said that he did not want to see a judge compelled to pass sentence on a man who by his vote might probably throw that very judge out of office. The pictue drawn was a sad one. He ■ eemed to see the judge quailing before his electorate. The idea never has seemed to dawn on the convention that such an election is a reflection upon the men to be se lected as judges. Are they weaker than other people? Will a judge quail be fore his electorate any sooner than any other officer? Why must such safeguards be placed about this pecu liar officer? They say they do not want a judge to be shaking hands with the people and going about election eering. If a judge cannot do this no man can—a sheriff nor a justice of the peace. Certainly a governor cannot, and so cannot many other high func tionaries. It is argued that the Leg islature Is not fit to elect a TJ. B. Sena tor, and yet in the same breath we are told that this is the very body to elect all of our judges. It has long been doubted whether the Legislature ought to possess any elec tive franchise, whether this right should not be placed in the people en tirely. We do know one thing—and this is meant for no reflection on any Legislator—that the average Legisla tor is no more fit to choose a judge than the average voter, and to entrust him with such function seems to re flect not on the people, but on the per son to be etosen. The cry haß been that the people should not be given this power because of their likelihood of being deceived by the demagogue, but the real trouble when sifted down by the advocates of Legislative elec tion, is that they are afraid of the judges wheu brought face to face with their creators, and hence must gve the poor creatures a chance. The thing is a mistake, a grave mis take, a mistake that ought not to be made in this day and generation. It has been cured by nearly every State in the Union. But Virginia, like her English ancestry, is holding on to ob solete theories, and getting obsolete results. The figures presented show that the i government need only build the Isth mian canal to get rich. It will posi tively be the best paying institution the government ever invested in. If we only had two or three more of those canals that we could build, our entire burden of taxation would be lifted. The reason Mr. J. P. Morgan does not build this canal himself is,that he will undertake to float the bonds and not the ships, his sense of propriety not permitting him to appear in too many capacities in the same transaction. The President recommends that Congress undertake the subject of ir rigation in the arid districts of the West. This can be done by leveling the Sieras so that the clouds can get over and rain fall in those quarters Other plans will be suggested, but this will be the most permanent. It will cost a trifle of course, but what is that to a nation of seventy-five millions of people. * I So greedy and wolf-like is protection that no sooner did the U. S. Supreme Court decide that articles could be im ported free of duty from our new colo nies, than a bill was immediately pre sented in Congress to prevent it. To bacco and sugar trusts need protection, even against our own little islands, and they will get it, beoauie they are so young and so fragile. . - —— Why need Congress, filled with pro tectionists, waste its time talking about trade expansion, when the policy of this government is to drive trade away. High tariff is made for the express purpose of keeping trade out, and does retard If not destroy it- Then how foolish to talk about ex panding trade. You know it must be done, but you hate somehow to have a tooth pulled. The same sensation is said to be felt by the politician who submits himself to Dr. Roosevelt. ——.* *- ' The Atlanta Constitution says: "If the Virginians had suspected that the t* constitutional convention was goli ;,' to become chronic, they wouldn't ha\ c gone out and caught it.

C. Braxton. Judging even from the sten ographic report, which we learn in no sense portrays tbe real picture, Judge Quarles must have lost his" temper, and usually to lose one's temper is to lose one's case. On the vote which was afterwards taken on Monday, I Judge Quarles received no support as Ito his views, save and except his own The fact that about $50,000 have been subscribed to ransom a young American woman of tbe name of Stone, from some alleged Brigands in some unknown country of the East, is sufficient refutation of the adage that "a rolling stone gathers no moss."

Reciprocity, like charity, is to begin at home. We are to have this bless ing between our United States and our Philippine Islands. When the world sees the vastness of its beauty, like children for Castoria, the world will cry for it. The "Crumpacker Bill" for reducing the representation in Congress from the Southern States, is again up. If the bill does not diea naturaldeathits name ought to kill it. There seems to be a growing belief that Mr. Roosevelt is likely to render himself as popular with his party, as Mr. Cleveland did with his. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. (From our Kegular Correspondent.) Washington, Dec. o.—Almost simul taneously with the opening of Congress the Supreme Court rendered its deci sion in the "Fourteen Diamond Rings" case, declaring that the Philippine Is lands are an integral part of the Uui" ted States and that the provisions of the Dingley tariff law do not, therefore, apply to shipments between the islands j and the United States. This, of course, I leaves the trade absolutely free aud threw the protectionists into parox ysms. With this incentive in view the dila tory methods which usually attend the first weeks of a new Congress have been abandoned. Speaker Henderson has already named the members of the Ways and Means Committee and it has held a session with a view to reporting a bill providing for tariff regulations between the United States and the Philippines. It is believed that the bill will simply apply the provisions uf the Dingley tariff without changing any of its rates. Congress has received the report of the Isthmian Canal Commission and the Senate is in receipt of the Hay- Pauncefote treaty. The latter has been referred to the Committee ou Foreign Relations and that committee has voted unanimously to report the convention for the favorable action of the Senate. It will be promptly rati fied. Senator Morgan has re intro duced his bill providing for the con struction of the Nicaraguan canal in accordance with the recommendation of the Commission, which favors that route, but to the person who reads care fully between the lines there is reason to suspect that there.is, in the prompt ness with which all this Is being done, something in the nature of a ruse aud that it is the hope of the promoters of the canal to bring the owners of the Parama route to reasonable terms, T hey now hold out for approximately $70,000,000 more than the Commission believes their plant to be worth. The President's advice on the tariff question quite accords with the views I! high protectionists of his party vhen those congressmen who have cated tarff revision have ventilat eir opinions to an extent which believe will satisfy their coristi s, and perhaps gain for them concessions in the way of pa ,ge or local appropriations, they will graciously consent to have their •buried in committee and will soon >t that they ever contemplated the sy of tariff revision—at least until have to ask their friends at home to re-elect them. I The only cloud on the republican sky I the recommendation of Mr. Roose It in regard to reciprocity with Cuba, lie President has said that from moral reasons and national interest we are bound to grant material concessions to Cuba, Tbe Sugar Trust has promised to add the gentle weight of its persua give influence to the movement, always provided that there is no reductiou on refined sugar, which, of course, means that the Cuban raw sugar can be bought cheaper by the trust but the consumer will have to pay just as much for the refined article, and Senator Lodge has been chosen to lead the fight in the Senate. There istme recommendation in the President's message which should re ceive the cordial support of congress men irrespective of party, and that is his appeal for support of the Postmas ter General in his eff/)rts to relieve the abuses which have crept into the ad ministration of the laws in regard to second class mail matter. Mr. Roose velt says that although second class matter constitutes nearly sixty per cent, of the mails, out of a total reve nue of $111 the Post office De partment i\ o-ived only $4,299,445 for transnrtsion of that class of mail. He goes on to say if the pound rate "were limited to the legitimate newspapers aud periodicals actually contemplated by the law no just exception could be taken " j pound rate was not originally contern- I plated by the f raraers of the law and ! which cost the government for trans portation and handling $15,657.49 against which the publishers paid postage amounting to $2,286 88 leaving j a net loss to the Department of $13,320 per weekly issue. An amusing incident occurred the 'other day. While standiug in the ante room of the 'President's reception room 1 saw a congressman go up to the Pres. identas he and Senator Lodge Mine out and say'want (o say a word for I Mr. Blank, who holds a small office in liny district—" "What!" the President ! interrupted. "Is that infernal scoun drel still thereT" Yes, I knew him when I was on the Civil Commission. Yes, I'll remember him," and be left the ani&zed legislator aud passed out Willi i uai o -■ Mr. Robert Erviue, who, for ten or twelve years has driven the four-horse team run by V. 15. Bishop between Monterey and Staunton, had what be terms a "close call" last week on Shen audoah mountain. While coming down the mounta.in with a heavy load, and when rounding the horseshoe turn, one! of the horses in Mr. Ervine's team fell on the ice and broke off the tongue of the wagon. Mr. Ervine's longcxperi-l ence as a wagoner, and his presence of | miud, enabled him to do the right thing promptly and thus avert a serious dis- j aster. With the aid of his well trained saddle horse, he succeeded in heading! the fore wheels toward the bank, where he anchored until a new tongue ! could be improvised. One day last week 750 pounds of venisou bams came across the line from West Virginia and were shipped ] of the county this season. Neither party has butchered yet, bu those who have seen the two hogs estimate their | weight at figures varying from 500 to 550, with the odds iv doubt. With two exceptions, these are the largest hogs raised iv the county for many years. Sheriff J. Ed. Arbogist started last week with William Minor for the re form school, near Kiflbmond. Minor is the colored lad who was convicted of larceny last fall and who remained in jail here until he could be admitted to the school. Dr. Oharleß 13.

Kidney trouble preys upon the mind, dis courages and lessens ambition; beauty, vigor and cheerfulness soon disappear when the kid neys are out of order or diseased. Kidney trouble has become so prevalent that it is not uncommon for a child to be born afflicted with weak kid neys. If the child urin ates too often, if the urine scaias me nesh or if, when the child reaches an age when it should be able to control the passage, it is yet afflicted with bed-wetting, depend upon it. the cause of the difficulty is kidney trouble, and the first step should be towards the treatment of these important organs. This unpleasant trouble is due to a diseased condition of the kidneys and bladder and not to a habit as most people suppose. Women as well as men are made mis erable with kidney and bladder trouble, and both need the same great remedy. The mild and the immediate effect of Swamp=Root is soon realized.

Constitutional Convention, The Constitutional Convention de voted much time to a discussion of a resolution offered by Mr. Quarles pro viding that section 8 of tbe judiciary report, providing 24 court circuits, be recommitted. | The feature was a discussion between Messrs. Quarles and Braxton over the questiou of retaining a city court in Staunton. Mr. Quarles said he did uot think Staunton needed a corporation court; that no business man of Staun ton wanted it, and the court was kept up to give the judge an office. He de clared that the committee had forced a court ou Staunton that the people did not want. He then criticized the eigh teenth circuit, composed of Rocking ham, Augusta and Rockbridge coun ties, and contended that no one judge could transact the business of that cir I Quarles insisted that what i and other cities of her size ,nd wanted was a circuit court uld transact all the business Id not require the cities to pay 'ies. axton opposed the proposition ed by Judge Quarles. He said lie of his city wanted the pres- j court retained, and read, in ' of his position, a memorial embers of the bar, the city of Staunton and others, lotion made by Judge Quarles nmit this sectiou was over igly defeated. Deafness Cannot be Cured by local applications, as they cannot reach the diseased portion of the ear. There is only one way to cure deafness, and that is by constitutional remedias. Deafness is caused by an intiamed con dition of the mucous lining of the Eus tachian Tube. When this tube gets in tiamed you have a rumbling sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is entire ly closed deafness is the result, and un less the inflammation can be taken out and this tube restored to its normal con dition, hearing will be destroyed for ever; nine cases out of ten are caused by catarrh, which is nothing but an in flamed condition of the mucous sur faces.
