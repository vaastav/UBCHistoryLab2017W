KETTLE Among the features of the recant elec iou in New York city worthy of passing mention were the epithets hurhd at each other by the leading Democratic journals who had a falliDg out on the

are such that he n ver reads a book unless it is bound in superior Btyle and has a wide margin came near accepting the position of literary critic of one of them It may be remarked that these j mrnals probably did not lose a reader by the use of these choice Democratic dic tionary terms Yet why should Ihej May not what they said be largely true k NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT One of the resolutions at Waco was to the effect that the people of that city will join the committees at Dallas in investi gating the charges against the roafls of discriminations in rates in favor of Cali fornia as against Texas Every delegate should know btfore he goes to Dallas that this charge is true and be ready to act without any long discussions over this point that might necessitate subse quent meetings and conferences with railroad officials There is not time for this Tourists must come to Texas in January and Feb ruary if they corse at all in 1888 They will not come in the summer season It should be distinctly understood that Texas is a xsinter resort and now is the time to inaugurate he 1 cent per mile tourist rate Ntxt summer will not do nor even next spring Certain railroads cannot deny that they carry emigrants from Ktnsas Cityjto Ssn Francisco for S35 each and give them sleepirgcars free and proportionately low rates from St Louis Cincinnati and Chicago are made or are authorized by them This means about 1 centner mile for the Missouri Pacific which bringB these people to Fort Worth and turns them ovpr free sleepers and oil to the Texas and Pacific The rates per mile from Kansas City to Texas points is about double the abeve Again The roads carry tourists from Kansas City to Sin Francisco and turn on flrstclsss tickets good for six months and good to stop off at will west of El Paso for C0 while they charge 354 for a round trip ticket from Kansas CUy to El Paso and will not sell one at all to Fort Worth Dallas Waco or any other point In Njrth Texas Thus a prospector wtio

tourist and emigrant ticsets ask the California lines to return the compliment by giving Texas clieap tickets They do not ask it and would not get it if they should as the California lines are working for California and the Pacific coast Meantime Texas naturally the best state in the Union not only fails to get any immigration worth mentioning from the outside but is being constantly drained for the benefit of the Pacific coast conn tyIt It Is Indeed time for the people of T x s and for the railroads of Texas to make some i ffort In behalf of Texis TIMELY WOBDS During his visit to Mo itgomery Ala Mr Lewis of the Derolt Free Press known better as M Qaad was present at a meeting of citizens held to devise means to attract immigration to that state and In the course of his spfech said The

the people ofKansas were throwing every thing overboard and coming east I have been all over the great west and I am pre pared to tell you that It Is the greatest humbug in America You have every in ducement to bring people bere and what you want is to let the world know what you have You have got the climate the soil the people the schools the churches the minerals the forest and everything to attract emigration and give all comers homes and comforts and all that civiliza tion demands The tide of emigration must come south But the town and country that does the best advertising wi 1 get the

POSTOFFICE BUILDINGS PostmasterGeneral Vilas in his official report advocates the building of more Federal postt ffices throughout the coun try in addition to those already in ex istence and shows by incontrovertible figures that investments of this character would be a saving of many dollars to the general government The proposition is favored by many of the leading newspa pers of the country regardless of politics The more rabid Repuolican journals while seconding the recommendation captiously qualify their advocacy by the expression of groundless fears to the effect that in the erection of these build ings certain localities whould be discrim inated against en purely partisan grounds These objections are urged not in sin cerity but on partisan grounds and for the purpose of militating against the present Democratic administration They are both stupid and untenable ob jections and will have no force or ffict with the sobT thinking people of the country who are seldom influenced by the ravings of office seekers The record TEE

Democrats have held a rnoj > rity in the House of Representatives exctpt for two sessions those of the Kiter Congress elected with Garfield in 1880 Wnile the Democratic majority in the House is small it will be large enough if the party shall be united for the accomplishment nf all legitimate political ends In tao recent period of Demo cratic supremacy in the House a great many wise measures and some tat were otherwise have been put upon the statutebook Bat the best Demo cratic eff rts in the House have < if ten been frustrated sometimes by divisions m the party and sometimes by a hostile Republican msj irity in the Senate From the election of M chael C Kerr an advanced revenue reformer to the speakership of the House In 1875 the pre vailing sentiment of the Democratic ma j > rlty has been in favor of a revision of me tariff Mr Kerr organized the ways and means committee with tnat end in vi > w and Mr Randall who succeeee 1 h m made no apparent departure from tnat policy In fact when a candidate for Speaker the second time Mr Randall in a letter to the merchants of Gtlveston t xpresed veiy liberal views on the tar ff question and on the strength of that ic ier he obtained a great mai y votes I was not uit 1 he had been remitted to th fl tor by the election of Mr Carlisle to the apeakershlp in 1883 that he began to manifest reactionary spirit and to culti vate a faction

election of 1874 have never aban doned their purpose to accomplish this great economic reform At labtthe ques tion of taiiff revision has come up io such a shape that its consideration can not bo avoided or delayed It is fortu nate for the Democratsfrom a mere party point of view that the financial situation Is such as to compel them to meet thi issue The renomination of President Cleveland has been conceded but the suc cess of bis candidacy for the presidency must largely depend upon the courage and skill with which the question shall be nvt This f onsideratlon united with a sense of

exceedingly un certain it is feuffloie nt to fix political re sponsibility before the people There if no donbttbat the practical politicians in the Republican party would beglat ii they could go
