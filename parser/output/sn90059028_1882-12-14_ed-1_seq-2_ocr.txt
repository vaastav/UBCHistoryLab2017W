Belle Plaine Herald: We learn as we go to press, that a most horrible tragedy oc curred at Montgomery, Le Sueur county, on Saturday last, by which a young man named Moriarty met with a most frightful death, the head being nearly severed from his body by an ax. From all the infor mation at present available it appears the sheriff of Le Sueur county attempted to ar rest Moriarty, and was shot by the latter with a revolver, the ball penetrating the shoulder. Moriarty then started to run and tp© sheriff in pursuit who called upon a Swede or Bohemian, who was chopping wqpd, to strike Moriarty, wihich thel&tter did, using the poll of the ax. While the wounded man lay on the ground, stunned by the blow, the 8wede, at the reeuest of the request of the sheriff, used the edge of the ax and nearly severed the head from the trunk. It seems strange that any per son, even at the desire of a sheriff, should should constitute himself such a butcher, and it is equally strange how any sheriff sboold make such a request.

The Georgia legislature has just declined a gift of $50,000 tendered the State universi ty at Athens, by Senator James E. Brown, of Georgia. The legislature declared that the conditions would create a "Brown aris tocracy" in Georgia. These conditions made the gift a fund for edueating poor young men. They provided that young men might be nominated to the beneficiaries of the fund by the sons of Senator Brown who are also to have a share in the control. Each of the beneficiaries was to give his note for a fixed Bum, to be repaid when he was established in business. Senator Brown was asked to-day if he proposed to renew his offer in any shape. He said he did not, but he would certainly make the gift to the college of some state on the same conditions, Rabbi Wechsler, of St. Paul, makes a statement showing that he and the St. Paul society are in no way responsible for the hapless oondition of the Russian refugees in the Devil's Lake county. It is more a mis fortune than a fault all around that the ref ugees are suffering for the necessaries of life. But the fact remains that unlfess some relief is afforded these hapless people, they will not survive the hardships of the winter in a new country without clothing or anything to eat. The long-contcsted suit for possession of the Arlington estate by the heirs of Gen Lee has at last been decided by the United States supreme court, in favor of the claim ants the United 8tates not having a valid title.

The heirs are willing to sell the property to the government, aud'a bill has been introduced in the senate to tnat end.

The report of the tariff commission says that their theory had been to make a sym metrical revision and reduction of the tar iff, keeping in view the relation which each article on the list bore to every other. They had then made the rate as lowasit possibly could be with a view to the suc cessful protection of American industries. It would be fonnd upon a study of their recommendations that nothing in them oould be touched without injury to business interests as a whole, while at the same time they had left a sufficient margin for the protection of the various manufacturing en terprises which had been developed in this country and were at work in competition with tfie skilled labor of the world. There are some general features of the re port which are preminent, such as the abo lition almost entirely of compound duties and the adoption of specific rates in place of a combination of both specific and ad valor em. There has also been a sweeping change made by the abolition of all fees, charges and commissions, which upon some classes of goods will be equivalent to a reduction of the tariff rate. This is espec ially true of pottery and other bulky arti cles. The tariff on Bessemer steel rails has been reduoed from $28 to $18 a ton, and on blooms His put down to of cent a pound. The duty on raw wool has been made speci fic instead of compound as before, ana has been slightly reduced. The commission recommends that on first-class clothing wools, such as are commonly sheared in the west the duty be 10 cents a pound on those valued at less than 30 cents and 12 oents a pound on thos valued at over cents. It is the same on wools of the sec ond class known as combings. The exist ing tariff, which is compound, is equiva lent to about 12J cents a pound on an aver age for such wools as are produced by the western growers. Tbe recommended tariff will only be about 2t cents less. This is on unwashed, wool. On washed, it is about twice as much. On some woolen goods the compound duties are retained, but upon lower gradesjthere is recommended a very large reduction of the tariff. The tariff on the lower grades of woolen blankets is re duced about 60 per cent. There is a reduction of about 16 per cent, on carpets. The tariff on ready-made clothing is cut down about one-fourth. The nee list is given a far wider scope than ever before and is headed by wood puli. Spices and all green fruits except oranges, lemons and grapes are also on*tne free list. The dye extracts and crude chem icals used in the manufacture of medicines are on the free list, as is auinine. A bin gie copy of any foreign publloKdon, book, pamphlet or newspaper is recoftMiended to come in free of duty in order Ckat articles of this kind may be sent from abroad through the mails, There is a reduction of 25 per cent, on printing paper. The cotton schedule has been changed from A to I, and his been very much condensed. There is a reduction of about 30 per cent, on cottons With all compound tarif& abol ished. There is a new schedule on sugars and a revolution in the method of levying the tariff is recommended. The commis sion recommends that all sugars which are known as below erode thirteen be dutiable according to the polariscope test, abolishing the Dutch Btandard. Above this grade the commission recommends the retention of the Dutch Standard system. The effect of the recommendation would be a considerable reduction of the duty. On oranges, lemons and grapes, the only dutiable fruits under the proposed revision, there is simply a specific duty of so much per box. The duty on all medical prepa rations is reduced from 40 to 25 per cent, ad valorem. Th«b ad valorem duty on iron ore is abolished, owing to the varia tion of values, and a specific duty of 50 per cent a ton, which amounts to about 5 per cent, reduction, is recommended. Analene dyes are now paying over 100 per cent and the commission recommends that they shall pay 40 per cent. duty. On salt there is a reduction recommended on the article which comes in sacks and bar rels of from 12 cents per 100, the presen duty, to 10 cents per 100, and upon salt in bulk from 8 cents per 100 to 6 cents per 100. Duties on tobacco are removed, and the duty on cigars, cigarettes, etc., are made $8 a pound. There is no change recommended in the duty on lumber and none on grain The d%ty on fire crackers and playing card is raised from 50 per cent, ad valorem to 100 per cent ad valorem. The tariff on all silk goods has been Very heavily reduced. Tak big the recommendation as a whole, the revision will involve a reduction on the part of the tariff list, ranging in all import ant features from 20 to CO per cent.. Th^ only notable exception is in the case of the pottery industry, which the commissioi. found it was impossible to reduce withou: ruining the business of American ihanufact nrers. THE SCHEDULES. Schedule D—Woods: There have been no changes in this schedule. Sugw It is recommended that the polariscope test be adopted, and an average decrease ot about 15 per cent, be made. Schedule F—Tobacco: There have been no changes in this schedule, except the abolition of compound duties and the sub stitution of specific duties. Schedule G—-Provisions: As tha duties on this schedule are ?ery low few recom­ mendations of decrease have been made. A slight decrease has been made in the duty on rice, and the rates of the other items enumerated In this schedule have been made more harmonions. The duties on dried fruits, mustard, and several other minor articles have been reduced. Schedule H—Liquors Practically no changes have been made in this schedule, excepting that the rebate of 5 per cent, al lowed for breakages has been abolished and the schedules rearranged. Schedule I—Cottons: The new schedule will operate to simplify the present tariff by the abolition of all. c&intntih duties, contra dictory Sections and ambiguous expressions, and by the substitution of six divisions. It has been necessary in order, to make an ad equate specific duty on the higher priced cloths, to make a distinction in the un bleached goods at above 8 cents, bleached goods at above 10 cents, and on printed goods above 15 cents per square yard, and on these goods an ad valorem duty of 40 per cent, is recommended instead of 4. In the section relating to cotton thread, yarn, warps or warp yarns there has beett a gen eral reduction of 25 to 30 per cent. Schedule K—Wool and woolens: The reduction suggested is fully 20 per cent, and for the great bulk of fabrics from 18 to 40 per cent. Comparitively less reduction is proposed on the finer, lighter and more costly cloths. Schedule L—Silk: Specific duties have been substituted for an ad valorem wherever the former could be made to ap ply. The duties recommended indicate a reductibh of something more than 23 per cent Schedule M—Papers and books: News papers and periodicals have been made free of duty ana some other changes of minor importance made, and the duties reduced on an average fully 20 per cent. A Just Condemnation of Washington Journalism. Judge Mylie, of the District Court, in his Charge to A grand jury, a few days ago, se* verly reprehended phased of Wsshingtofc Journalism represented by the newspapers of that city, and the special correspondents of outside newspapers. He said the news papers were constantly containing scanda lous libels on public men and on private character. That was a species of offense that created more unhappinesg and misery in so oiety, and indeed more injustice than any other form of crime. He rather suspected that waiters tot periodical newspapers had among others more than the usual proportions of liars. They were bad for lying. The more sensational the lie was the more calculated it was to blast the peace of families, and the spicer it was, the more the paper would sell and newspaper men would laugh in derision at anybody who undertook to talk of them seriously about the injustice of a thing of that kind. He knew there were men of in tegrity and honesty connected with news papers, who entertained and cherished hon orable and christian sentiments, and thought on the whole there was an improvement going on in that respect. If the public would cease to patronize such papers as he alluded to such low vice and crime would soon die out. The disinherited daughter of Rev. D. BdingtonBorr of St Louis, is engaged in effort to secure $2,000,000 left by her frther to the Bpiscopal societies of that city. S inte™pen*e he was Unfitted to & will,

By a vote of 16 to 34 the senate refused to indefinitely postpone the bankruptcy bill and by 84 to 30 substituted for the judician committee bill the "Lowell bill," introduced by Mr. Hoar. Byj a vote of 44 to 16 the Pendleton civil service reform bill was taken up. Mr. Pen dleton agreed to have tbe bill laid aside that the Fitz John Porter bill might be taken up, but Mr. Logan objected. The president sent the following nomina tions to the senate: John P. Baker, Illi nois, to be major and paymaster Chandler B. Watson, to be collector of customs of the southern district of Oregon. The]senate in execution session confirmed a large number of nominations. including Gen. Pope and Col. McKenzie to be maj. general and brigadier general respectively There was no contest. HOUSB.—Mr. Townshend offered a resolu tion reciting that it is alleged certain exist ing railway lines of transportation have en tered into combination for the purpose of preventing the construction of competing lines into territories and through states, thereby establishing monoplies in transpor tation, and diiecting the committee on com merce to report without delay a bill prohib iting and punishing such combination. Mr. Strait objected to present considera tion and it was referred to the committee on commerce. Bills and resolutions were introduced re stricting the coinage of silver dollars and proposing a constitutional amendment providing for the election of presi dent and members of congress. The latter fixes the term of president at six years and makes the president ineligible for a second term provides that he be elected by direct vote of the people and that the term of representatives in congress be three years in length.

Thompson, former bookkeeper for Farnham & Lovejoy, charged with hav ing robbed them of some $20,000. An ex pert accountant and detectives have been at work upon the case for some time, and the arrest was made as soon as sufficient evi dence against the accnsed to warrant sach a proceeding had been secured. Thompson was dismissed from the service of Farnham & Lovejoy in September for susrected crookedness, and since then has been in business for himself. He modestly declines to talk with reporters on the theme with which he is chiefly interested, but is urder stood to claim ability to clear himself from his unpleasant predicament. A Dakota Scandal in Court. Laura Allen, the divorced .wife of A. M. Allen of Lincoln, Dak., has began a $5,000 action of slander in a Chicago court agaiust her husband. She charges him with hav ing caused her arrest on thechaTge of arson, also With publishing in Dakota', a report that she was a woman of ill-fame and had attiBmpted to black-mail him. A capias was issued as asked. Mrs. Allen was not on hand when the arson case was called, and bir bond was declared forfeited. Persona! Items. Gov.

Hon. William H. Brown, one of the most prominent citizens and physicians and mayor of Bangor, Me., in 1879 and '80, died yesterday afternoon, altera lingering illness, caused by the failure of the digestive organs. He was born in that city June 14, 1882 graduated at Bowdoin in 1842, and Harvard Medical school in 1850. Samuel F. Perry, grandson of Com modore Ferry, had just been incarcer ated in Michigan state prison for rob binga county treasury last spring of $770. This hopeful descendant of the great na val hero was the chief instrument on the robbery of a bank in Baltimore by which he and his confederates secured a large amount of booty and escaped with it to England. Hon. 8. H. Treat, United States dis trict jadge of Illinois, who lives at Springfield, has been in continuous ser vice upon the bench in Illinois since 1837, or a total of forty-five years. Froua 1837 to 1841 he was judge of the eighth judicial circuit, from 1841 to 1855 he was a judge of the superior court, and since 1855 he has been a United States district judge. He is still hale and hearty, and all appearances indicate that he is good for another quarter of a century upon the bench. Mr. William Warren, the veteran Bos ton comedian, attained the age of seven ty years on Friday last, on which day there was left at his home, in behalf of the Boston Museum company, a circular salad bowl of solid beaten silver, lined with gold, and suitably inscribed. Ac companying the bowl were a salad spoon and fork of beaten gold. Mr. Warren acknowledged the gift in a letter which was posted in the green-room of the theatre. Count Joseph Telfener, who is a thorough Italian, notwithstanding his German name, has paid $1,500,000 for a tract of land in Tom Green county, Tex as. As yet the count knows only three words. English—"yes," "no" and "in deed." He has been in New York city for three months, Salvini dining witn him frequently. The Countess Telfener is a younger sister of Mrs. Mackay, wife of "Bonanza" Mackay. Of Dr. Geo. W. Wiener, the Baltimore oculist, who died some days ago in Den ver, Col., it is related that he on.ee treated in Europe a wealthy gentleman with such success that the patient at once willed all his property to the doc ter. Years afterward the man died, hia own daughter was disinherited, and the fortune came to Dr. Wiener. The girl, left a pauper, wrote to Dr. Wiener appealing for aid. He at once went to the consnl of the country in which she lived (he was then in America), intend ing to transfer the fortune to her, but was told that the transfer could be legally affected only in that country. Thereup on he immediately took passage for Europe, and placed the entire fortune in her hands. Mr. Peet, a rather diffident man, was unable to prevent himself from being introduced one evening to a fascinating young lady, who, misunderstanding his name, constantly addressed him as Mr. Peters, much to the gentleman's distress. Finally, summoning courage, he bash fully but earnestly remonstrated: "Oh! don't call me Mr. Peters call me Peet." "Ah, but I dbn't know yoa well enough, Mr. Peters," said the young lady, blush ing, as she playfully withdrew part way behind her fan.—Yale Becord. What Shall the Winter be. The New York Herald Weather Bu reau has resumed editorial charge of the seasons to which it constantly invokes attention. It says: The first snows ot the season on the eastern side of the country, which fell on Sunday, were rather a surprise after the generally mild autumn. But they were not premature, and a comparison of dates at which the first heavy snows of former seasons occurred shows that those of this week do not necessarily portend an early and cold winter. In the November preceding the memora bly mild winter of 1879-80 a storm ef rain or snow extended on the 26|h entirely over the lake region and still further to the northwestward, the Signal Ser vice reporting for that month total snow falls exceeding fifteen inches at several places in this State, and over seventeen inches in New England. Our last win ter, which was exceptionally mild, was also preceded in November by heavy snow on the 23d in Eastern Pennsyl vania, in Western New York to the depth of eipht to twelve inches as early as the 4th, and on the 16th snow covered portions of the mountains of North Car olina. The most ominous indication of an abnormally cold winter is the occur rence of excessive barometric maxima in the West and Northwest in November. Thus, preceding the intensely severe winter of 1876-77, there occurred on November 27 the verj* extraordinary barometric maximum of 30. 97 inches in Manitoba, and preceding the nnusually cold winter of 1880-81 there was an exceptionally high barometer on November 23, of 30.86 in ches in Ohio. The advance of such high pressure waves over the United States in November clearly indicates an unu sual refrigeration 01 the northern par.ts of this continent and tbe northeastern part of Asia, whence our cold waves oc casionally come, and hence their ap pearance signals the probable develop ment of an exceptionally cold season in these lower latitudes. Hitherto, how ever, we have had this season no such intense barometic maximo, the highest nressure rei\orted by the Signal Service the presenf month being about 30.70 inches, and that not extending over a wide area of tbe country. So far, there fore, as the season has now developed, the indications do not justify the fears of some that we are to have an excess ively rigorous winter, but rather the con trary. Author of "Home, Sweet Home.'* Mr. W. W. Corcoran's generous enter prise of bringing home to an American grave the exiled dust of John Howard Payne, recalls the aged philanthropist's reminiscences of the poet. He saw him first in 1809, when Payne, called "The American Roscius," was playing in a Washington theatre. Mr. Corcoran, who was then a mere boy, says: "Whenever could get 25 cents to pay for a seat, I went to see and hear the tragedian and his. memory ofhis appearance and action is now fresh and clear, after a lapse of seventy-three years. Two years later he saw him again, when Payne fled to Georgetown from Baltimore, where he had been trying to defend a printing office from a mob. In 1840 the personal acquaintance of the two began, and con tinued on vety initmate term until Payne went as United States Consul to Tunis and died there. Mr. Corcoran has sel ected the spot where the poet's remains are to rest It is atriancularplot, near the eastern entrance of Oak mil Ceme try on the crest of a hill, overlooking the valley of Bock Greek.

The Farmer's Board of Trade of Minnesota, created by a state law, convened at St. Paul last week and were in session three days. President Lyman Loring of Moorhead in the chair, and the following members present! Geo. Giles, Belle Plaine, Scott county, secre tary John Byers, Hastings Z. B. Page, Man torville, Dodge eonnty Jas. McBroom, Dan ville, Blue Earth county Ole Peterson, Gil christ, Pope county Tho». Purcell, Oakland, Freebom county. J. T, Price ofEyota, Olm sted county ana E. Evan son of Litchfield. J.'C. Schofield, of Bloomington, Hennepin county, was unable to be present, having cut his foot badly. The objects "of this board are to consider matters pertaining to the grading and transportation of wheat and all other matters of interest to farmers which need legislation, and it is their duty to make a report to the legislature recommending whatever legislation they have in their deliberations found necessary. Among the members there was a general discussion as to wheat grading, railway discrimination, etc. Mr. Loring said the dissatisfaction among the farmers with tbe grading in general and the, whole elevator business in particular, was deep and wide spread. He and others spoke bitterly against the system of mixing wheat, and all averred that the producer should be able to get the price for the quali ty of wheat he raises if it is No. 1 bard, he should not be in danger of having his crop mixed with that of a much poorer quality. The general sentiment was that the legisla ture should look into the matter and the board proposes to urge the apointment by law of a state inspector, so that Minnesota grades may be uniform. Gen. Baker, state railroad commissioner, was present, and while admitting the evils under which the farmer's suffered, caution ed the board to be careful about the recom mendations which they made to the legis lature. The granger legislation of a few years ago, while it accomplished much good, was full of absurdities, and the board should be careful this time to recom mend nothing osdless, nor unnecessary. Gen Baker said that he was laboring dilli gently to see that justice was done to both people and roads, but he Was not prepared to foreshadow the recommendations which he should make to the legislature at its coming session. Tbe debates showed that the elevator companies lorroed a great monopoly, gener ally one ccmpany owning the warehouse on an entire line of road, So that competition was impossible, and hence prices kept below what they should be. As to inspection, the objection is, that the system is not uniform. It is alleged that each ele vator company has an inspector of its own that the Minneapolis millers have one, while the port of Duluth has another. These differ from, each other in their grad ing Much dissatisfaction was felt' in re gard to the charges for shipping through the elevatgrs. A great deal was said about the practice of charging the same price for short hauls as for long and many in stances given of v^hat is deemed- un just discrimination between shippers. The rebate system by which railroads fa vor shippers from St. Paul and Minneapolis was also considered, the prevailing sentiment being that all should be treated with equal fairness by common carriers and |no pre ferences shown. A number of resolutions were offered end referred to the committee on legislation, who will draw up a report and submit to the governor. The board did not adept any_ resolutions, but left all the matters at issue in the hands of the com mittee. Thejresolutions, which will proba bly be explained in the report, favor some wise and judicious legislation restricting and limiting the railroads cf this state ii their charge, for passenger and freights and believe that this may may be best attained by establishing maximum and mini mum iates that the powers of the railroad commissioners should be en larged. The following are- authoritative, as having been sanctioned directly by the most influential members Ol the board, and will doubtless be embraced in the report as to grading the whole system of the grading of wheat in Minnesota ia iniquitous to the farmers. There is no uniformity, in tha.' what one inspector would grade as No. 1 another would class as No. |1 hard, which is more valuable, and there is no legal or moral rule nnder which the several inspectors are responsible. Aprain: In almost any case the inspector in the buyer, and instead of acting in a quasi judicial way, is, so long as he is h'iman, in clined to favoritism for his employer. A a practical illustration, one inspector ma\ grade No. 1 hard wheat as Ne. 1 simply and the lormer is actually worth about 0 cents per bushel more than the latter. As to freights. The freights upon whea' are too high and inure in exorbitant meas ure to the benefit of the railway companie and to the disadvantage of the grain pro ducer. It ad van tageth a farmer nothing to live nearer the lake port or milling place one hundred miles or more in that, in ordet to keep their lands in the market the railway companies give Western growers equal, or nearly equal, rates. For example, a car load of wheat costs the same from Wadena, Minn., that it does from Valley City, Dak., to a market. The railways make up the de ficit on freights from competing points by charging far more than tne transportation is worth from points where the several road have matters in their own.hauds. This 1 done by giving competing points Tebat which the isolated one do not gee. Minnesota Normal Schools. At a meeting of the State board in St. Paul, the principals of the normal schools reported severally, and the following aggre gates were obtained: Number of graduates of normal schools to date— Winona 455 Mankato 227 St. Oloud 225 Total 907 Enrollment of students to Sept. 1.1882— Winona 438 Mankato 3515 St Cloud 304 Total 1,077 Attendance at fall term, 1882— Winona 438 Mankato 381 St Cloud. 274 Total l,0f»3 In a general way it was stated that the normal schools were never so prosperous as now and the directors talked over the de sirability of making them more nearly con nected with the common schools. Morton & Co., general merchandise deal era of Northfield, overreached their credit and have been closed for invoice. A con vocation of unfortunate creditors will now share the assets of the concern with the able lawyer. Andrew Anderson charged with murder ing his wife on the 22d of last February, which was on trial f®r several days in the Renville county court at Beaver Falls, closed Saturday. Drs. Bartlett of St. Peter, Frost, of Weimar, Flynn, of Redwood Falls, and Stoddart of Beaver Falls, all testified tbat the defendant was insane at the time he committed the murder, ana experts testified us to his sanity. A num ber ©f Andersons neighbors' testified that they believed Anderson of sound mind. The jury, after being out about twenty min utes, returned a verdict of man slaughter. The Fergus Falls Water Power company have filed articles of association with the secretary of state. The capital stock is $50, 000 and the directors consist of Henry G. Page, Charles D.

The members of the Bapt'st church of Crookston have decided to build a small chapel, to cost about $1,000. Duluth is to have anew post-office build ing. J. H. Webster "and Oscar Freeman died in Red Wing, Tuesday. Mr. Webster was sixty two years old, and was an old settler, having come to Red Wing in the early days from Windsor, Vt., with Messrs Mclntire and Sheldon. The cause of his death was a rup ture received some two years ago, from the effects of which he was prostrated about one week since. Mr. Freeman died from blood Sex oiaon.

Wis home was at North Pacific Junc tion. He was the son ofT. G. Riley and aged about nineteen. Bishop Whipple dedicated the new Epis copal church at Crookston last Monday. The edifice will seat 225 peruons, and the cost is about $3,000. The gold excitement has been somewhat on the increase in Granite Falls the past week, owing to the fact that some good specimens have been taken from it a mine, and also reports of rich quartz having been found in Rock Valley, in Redwood county, some sixteen miles below that vil lage. The golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Free man Talbot will take place at their resideiice at Cleveland, Lebueur county on the 8th of January next. Mr. Talbot has many friends outside of his own neighbor hood, who will congratulate ?*im on the happy event, and wish him many returns. The Farmers' Mutual Insurance company of Fillmore county have filed articles of in corporation with Insurance Commissioner McGill. The company expects to be ready for business by January 1, 1883. ••Don't Work for Anybody." Singular as it seems, the above phase may mean the same as "work for every body." A reference to the following story published in the Woman's Journal and illustrating the constant all-day cares of a mother, will explain the paradox. A little boy, on his way to build fires and gweep offices in Boston, while the stars were yet in the sky, told the writer: "My mother gets me up, builds the firo ftnd gets my orcakfest and sends off. Then she gets my brother up am. gets his breakfast ana sends him on. Then she gives the other children their breakfast and sends them to school and then she and the baby have their break fast." "How old is the baby?" I asked. "Oh, she is 'most two, but she can taiK and walk as well as any of ua." "Are you well-paid?" "I get two dollars a week, and my fath er gets two dollars a day." "How much does your mother getr With a bewildered look, he aaia, "Mother! Why, she don't work for any "/thought you said she worked for all of you." 61ace A '"Oh yes, for us she doesj but there aint any money in it." This wife of a day-labor represents a large class of hard-working women. There is more than one "labor of loys tbat draws no pay in cash. But mankind would be a much meaner race if all such labor were turned into a hireling's task. The true wife and mother could not respect herself if all her services at home were counted at a price and settled for in a day's or week wages. Incident in Gen. Wolesley's Ca reer. An incident in the career of Sir Garnet Wolesley, at the storming of Lucknow. has been commemorated in a painting ust completed in London. The story is as follows: "An officer and a few men. had been sent with pick axes and crow bars to freft a gate way which had been bricked up and barricaded by the ene my. Private Andrews, a gallant fellow, who bad been Wolesley's servant in the Crimea, ran out from under shelter to show his comrades the way across. No sooner had he darted into the street than he was shot through the body from one of the loopholes. Wolesley had a particular regard for this fine fellow, and, though lie was lving out in the street within five or six yards of the loophole fro whence he had been shot. Woleslev sprang out and bore him back in his arms. As he was carrying An drews a Pandy took deliberate aim "t the officer, but the bullet passed through the body oi the soldier, striking him again in almost tbe same spot where he had been previously wounded. He, however, recovered,and is now enrolled in the corps of commissionaires. Sunday School Talkers. Experienced Sunday school speakers know the danger of asking questions at random of their juvenile audiences. Novices often blunder into the habit not knowing its risks. One of these novices, who happened to be a particu larly well-dressed young clergyman, tried his hand on a Boston Sunday school. He began by saying: "Now. my dear children, look at me and tell me where you think I came from." One' of the "dear children" held up his little hand and said: "I know, sir." The snruce-looking clergyman benignant !w gazed on the young child, ana, besto w ing ever so sweet a smile on him, said "Well, my little man, where do you think I came from?" The clerical and benignant smile was changed into an ex pression of horror when the illiterate youngster blurted out: "From the country, sir." An irreverent guffaw of laughter instantly pervaded the assem bly, and the moral atmosphere of the became such as almost to quench le good man's efforts at Sunday school oratory. Greatly embarrassed, he strug gled on for a little while with his speech and then floundered to a hasty conclu sion.—Buffalo Courier. Interior Department—Secretary Tell er's Report. Secretary Teller in his report recommends the disarming of the Indians and the pur chase of their arms by the government. He thinks this would remove the temptation t^. go upon the war-path. They have no other use for guns, because they have their lands secured to them and reasonable provision made for them, so that they need n«t fear. He is opposed to the policy of giving the In dians lands in severali ty, and recommends the passage of a law to give each tribe a patent for the land the government has guaranteed to it, leaving the Indians to determine the question of allottment for themselves. Very many of these reserva tions contain large areas of valuable land that cannot be cultivated by the Indiana even though they were as energetic and: laborious as the best class of white agricul turists. All such reservations should be reduced in size, and the surplus not needed ought to be bought by the government and opened to the operation of the homestead law, and it would then soon be settled by in dustrious whites, who, as neighbors, would become valuable auxiliaries in the work civilizing the Indians residing on the re mainder of the reservation. When thus re duced the government should issue to the tribe its patent, resting in the tribe the title in fee simple as fully as it does to the 160 acres given to the settler. The secretary re views the report of the commissioners of public lands, patents, and railroads. In indorsing his recommendation for the repeal of the pre-emption law and modification of the homestead, he remarks that the pre emption law, intended as a means of ena bling the citizen wishing to make a home to do so cheaply and speedily, has been used largely to aggregate large quantities of lands for the benefit of the speculator, and not for those for whose benefit it was intended. It will be useless to repeal the preemption laws if the opportunity shall exist to commit the Barae frauds nnder the cover of the homestead law. If it ia thought best to re tain the pre-emptim laws, they should^be so amended that the filing for pre-emption should precede the entry at least one year. The land grant railroads should be com pelled to pay the cost of the surveying, se lecting, and conveying lands, and the de 1 partment should be enabled by law to speed ily and completely adjust the land grants.
