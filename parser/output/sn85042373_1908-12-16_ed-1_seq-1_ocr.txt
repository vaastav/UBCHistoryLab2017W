Haines calmly watched in court today the construction of the state's oase to prove the charge that he was a principal with his brother, Capt. Peter C. Haines. Jr., in the killing ot William E. Annls at the BayBlde Yacht club last summer. The jury box was filled last night and an ad journment taken until today. ,The direct teetlmony of the state's I witnesses is expected to take only a little time hut the cross-examination will likely occupy three or four days. As had been outlined, Haines' counsel will endeavor to show that the de fendant's drawing of a revolver was an act of defense and not of offense The central figure in today's case was the appearance of state's chief witness, Mrs. W.

WAR ON SENATOR OWEN The Record of The Oklahoman Being Printed by Enemies Guthrie, Ok., Dec. 15.—An attack that was some months in preparation has been made upon Senator Robert L. Owen in an Oklahoma City Repub lican newspaper, the Times, in which the alleged connections of Senator Owen with the affairs of the five civi lized tribes of Indian territory for the last twenty-four years will be exploit ed. The attack purports to be. an expos ure of the methods employed by Sen ator Owen in amassing a large for tune estimated at several million dollarB, and in reaching such promi nence in the affairs of the state as to enure his election to the United States Bepate. This story of Senator Owen's life in Indian territory will be continued dally for probably more than a month. The Initial story tells of his getting a ,175,000 fee for dlsbuselng what is known as the "net proceeds claim," amounting to $1,952,000, for the Choc taw government in the early '90s. Senator Owen is reported to have said that he was paid only 140,000. Oklahoma Looked For It This attack upon Senator Owen was not unexpected by persons acquainted With Oklahoma politics. It has bten known for months that men were dil igently at work, searching for every detail of Senator Owen'a record in an effort to prove that he S• H.

Some of his bitterest ene* mles are leaders of the Democratic party to wl}tch he belongs, and it has been the. boast of his enethies that li attack upon him would defeat re-election to the United States Senate, should he be a candidate to ipeceed himself. It was planned to begin this attack upon Senator Owen in the last state oampalgn. Inasmuch an he was not a eandldate and as the controyernr bight confuse vital Issues of the cam paign, the attack was withheld. It is suaipeoted that eertain politicians am bitious to go to the United 8tates k^nate hope to profit by any embar rassment that may overtako Senator Owen in this recital ot his carreer in tawn territory in isuat quarter Off century. if months' ago by a newspaper corres pondent for. a statement of fact con cerning some of the charges against him to which Senator Owen replied briefly, that he knew the origin of the derogatory statements and woufil not dignify them by an answer. Senator Owen is* a Virginian by birth and a CherokeVcltlssen by blood. He is a man of culture and accom plishments and has the bearing and manners of an aristocrat. Owen as His Enemies bees Him In the preface to its forthcoming article concerning Senator Owen, the Oklahoma City newspaper prints this statement of his character: "Early In life, for example, he devin ed the folly of makiu^ any necessary qualntances, the utter impractlcable Jglg^f knowing those w.iom he could whose position in life would particularly advantageous to himself. A firm belief in these things seems to be the keynote in the char acter of the senior United States sen ator from Oklahoma, a man who never has deviated from the path of his own reckoning, who in obscurlrty as well as in conspiculty, has tolled with the same end in view—a double end in view, it may be—that of self and rep utation. "In fact, Robert L. Owen Is one of the few men in Oklahoma who has seen the plan of his life unfold itself as though he himself had designed it He has stepped from one opportunity to another. "Many of the things which most men have striven strenously for have come to him apparently of their own accord. He has been even so fortu nate that in the past few men of im portance have ever questioned his methods or tried to discover the path whereby he so easily, so gradually. Climbed. He has always exercised that sagacity which grasps the influ ence which makes for reputation. The easily won plaudits of the religious convention, the advocacy of. the com monplaces of our moral experiences, the temperance platform with its par donable enthusiasm and facile trans ports-rail these things Robert L. Owen has used." -V,TAFT'S DENIAL C. P. Taft Says He Never Owned Any Panama Canal Bonds Providence, R.

SlTllENS Says President RoosevelDt At Exhibition of His Works at Corcoran dallery 2," Washington, Dec. 16—Portraying Augustus Saint Gaudens as a great sculptor, whose works will stand in the very forefront among the master pieces of the greatest periods and the greatest peoples, President Roosevelt last night at an exhibition of St. Gaudens' works at the Corcoran gal lery of art, under the auspices of the American Institute of architects, paid eulogium to that artist's mastery of his craft The British, French and Brazilian ambassadors and others made speeches and a large, represen tative gathering was present. The president In touching briefly of the larger features that made St. Gaudens famous with a byword as to the varying achievements in the fields of pure art, literature and -set ence in America, flecked the original features of sculptors' Imaginative genius, and flayed the critics who found fault with the creations of art The president declared that all the world Is St. Gaudens' debtor. "The great nations antiquity of the middle ages and of modern times," he said, "were and are great in each several case, not only because ot the collective achievements of each people as a whole, but because of the sum of the achievements of the men of spe cial eminence and this whether they are excelled In warcraft or statecraft, as roadlmakers or cathedral build ers, as men of letters, men of art, or men of science. The field of effort is almost UmltleBS and pre-eminence in success in any part of It should be especially prized by the nation to which the man achieving success be longs. "Particularly should this be so with its in America. We have con quered a continent, we have laced it with railways, we have dotted It with cities. The twilight of letters con tinues, but much is now being done in the field of art." Describing the gold coins" whose re cent Issuance by the government awaken a clamor of criticism, the president declared St. Gaudens "gave us for the first time, a beautiful coin' age', not yet properly appreciated, but up to which, both the official and the popular mind will in the end grow." The president contended that the first few thousands of these coins are more beautiful than any coins since the days of the Greeks and that fre quent Comments on the bonnet of eagle plumes on the figure of liberty "illustrate curiously the exceedingly conventional character of much of our criticism and the frequent Inabil ity to understand originally until it has llron its place." The president said tt»e basis of most of the criticism was "nonsense." He characterizes St Gaudens^- genius as having- that lofty ihilgiltt which en abled him to grasp close at hand in the present "the beauty and majesty which in most men's eyes are dimmed until distance has softened the harsh angles and blotted out the trivial and the unlovely.** The president depicted 8t Gaudens' statue .of Tecumseh Sherman as ex traordinary, a wonderful work- of art, thMib ke had feared "that folly 

FTHEL EVENING STIMES if'.' which puts Washington in a toga or Louis XIV with his peruke in a Roman corselet" Work by work, the president ex pressed his views of their artistic value and declared that the unequalled beauty of ancient Greek figures was "of the form merely,", while St. The ambassador said this republic has many capitals and one of them Is the Ecole des beaux arts of Paris. To this capital he said, there came in 1867 a young American who had work ed until then as a cameo cutter in New York, Augustus St. Gaudens. From this point' the ambassador sketched the sculptor's advancement.' He said the example left by St. Gau dens is imperishable'as the story he has told in marble'and bronze, "and in all these works,'' he concluded "there is this same characteristic of sincerity, this life of the best, this im pression of life, as if some of his blood had mixed with the clay."

The ambassador declared that St. Gaudens' statue of'Sherman Is one of the most inspiring symbols of tri umph that art had ever conceived. That St Gaudens will live as one of the artistic glories of this country, was the declaration*'of James Bryce, the British ambassador. It is by St. Gaudens' imaginative expression that he will live.
