Federal Relations. On Wednesday last, in the Commons, Mr. Person, of New Hanover, submitted a majority report from the joint committee on federal relations ; and Messrs. Mebane, Newby and Outlaw submitted a minortty report After consid.rable discussion and several votes on the subject, the House made the whole matter the special order for the, 3d day of next month. On that day; according-to the present order of the House, the bill reported by a majority of the committe to call a Convention of the people of the State, will be taken up and the debate on fed eral relations w ill begin in earnest The Senate has been engaged for several days past in an animated discussion on the resolutions of Hon. Bedford Brown, proposing that Commissioners be sent to South-Carolina to urge her to pause in her course. We shall publish in full in our next the majority anil minority reports here referred to, with the bill providing for a Convention. The Convention bill, if we may judge from its en acting clause, proposes to call a Convention by a majority of the Legislature. The exacting clause is the uual one, and not " Be it enacted by the Gen eral Assembly, tieo-thirds of the whole number of members concurring" Ac. The bill proposes that an election shall be held in the several Counties for delegates on the 7th day of February, 1801, the Con vention to assemble in the City of Raleigh on the IStli d;iy of the same month ; said Convention to consist of one hundred and twenty members, the Counties to elect the same number of delegates they arc entitled to at present in the House of Commons. It is also provided that the Convention shall be limited, by requiring the members to take an oath before they proceed to business, that they will do no act " contrary to the act of the General Assem bly under which this Convention is called." It is also provided " that the said Convention, when as sembled, may consider all grievances impairing or affecting the equality and rights of the State of North-Carolina as a member of the United States, and determine the mode, and measure, and time of redress." And it is further provided " that do or dinance of said Convention dissolving the connec tion of the State of North-Carolina with the federal government, or connecting it with any other, shall have any force or validity until it shall have been submitted to, and ratified by, a majority of the qualified voters of the State for members of the Gen eral Assembly, to whom it shall be submitted for their approved or rejection." Now, in the first place, can the Legislature call a Convention by a bare majority ? Clause 1 of sec tion 1 of article 4 of the State Constitution is as follows: "So Contention of the people shall be call ed by the General Assembly, vnless by the concur rence of two-thirds of all the member of each house of the Gene-al Aesembly." We consider that clear language. "Xo Convention" shall be called by less than two-thirds. The language of the Consti tution is not as follows: "No Convention of the people shall be called" to alter, amend, or reeon itruct this Constitution; but "Aa Convention" shall be called by less than two-thirds. The Demo cratic party is committed against this majority doc trine. Mr. Kerr advocated it when running for Governor, ad Gov. Rcid opposed it; and subse quently, in the Legislature, Gov. Graham advocated it and CoL Biggs now Judge Biggs opposed it The party sustained Gov. Reid and CoL Biggs. In the second place, can the Legislature, which is the agent and creature of the people, bind the peo ple, its creators, in Convention ? In the third place, this Contention bill contem plates and makes arrangements for a dissolution of the Union, for it is expressly provided that "no or dinance of said Convention dissolving the connection of Xurth-Curolina teith the federal government," shall be valid and binding until submitted to and approved by the people. The prevision for submit ting the work of the Convention to the people for their approval or rejection, is a very important one. e are glad it was inserted. We learn, however, that it was opposed by the extreme men on the com mittee. We shall allude to this subject again. The Popclak Vote for Pkesidest. In the non slavtholdir.g States Lincoln received 1,831,168 votes; Breckinridge 103,513 ; Douglas 832,231 ; Bell 77,153; fusion 554,802. In the slaveholding States Lincoln received 27,032; Breckinridge 585,931; Douglas 112,954; and Bell 503,310. Lincoln's entire vote s 1,858,200 ; Douglas's entire vote, giving him his diare of the fusion vote, is 1,276,780; Breckin ridge's entire vote, giving him his share of the fusion Tote, is 812,500; Bell's entire vote, giving him his share of the fusion vote, is 735,504, the aggregate vote against Lincoln being 2,824,874, leaving him in a minority of 960,674. L. S. Senator Wilsos Changes His Mind. Senator Wilson wrote a letter to the John Brown celebration, which from force of circumstances could not come off in Boston, in which he said : " W hile I accord to John Brown sincerity of motive. unselfish devotion, and unsurpassed courage, I de plore and condemn his armed invasion of Virginia, ere it in mv nnwer to do so. I would not consent to attend your meeting, for I cannot by any act of '"ie inus associate in any degree the issues con cerning slavery with John Brown's lawless descent "fun uarper s t erry." Usiox Meeting in the Commons Hall. Being unwell, we were not able to attend, but we learn that an enthusiastic Constitutional Union meeting ws held in the Commons Hall on Thursday nieht That honest old patriot, CoL Harrington, of Har nett, presided. We learn that J. W. Hinton, Esq., f Pasquotank, delivered an able and eloquent Rpeech in favor of the Union and against present wtion looking to dissolution. The Charleston Mercury, speaking of the late ouinern nights Meeting in W ayne country, iN. says," 44 Old Rip, although not quite awake, is making very strong preparatory grants. He'll feel "vw atter awbile." The Mercury is disposed to be complimentary towards North-Carolina. The Mercury thinks ,401d ftlP will not move until after he has been kieked. Pity that the disunion meeting in Wayne could obtain nq better notice at the hands of the organ of "ill the rivalry." The Voice of the People. , - We continue our extracts from letters ireceived from friends. A friend and sterling Democrat, on the eve of sailing for Europe, writes as follows : . ... - 44 1 dislike to leave mv count in these difficult times, but I trust all will yet be welL Your advice to prepare, but to 44 watch and wait" in the wiliest and best course we can pursue. This is no time for impulse or hasty action. We had the agony before the election the Xorth is having it now. We warned them of the disastrous effects of Lincoln's election, and they are now feeling them in tiie pros tration of business and a fearful panic. But let wise' counsels prevail in the South, and the Union may yet be saved. The Northern people are alarmed. They have got the elephant, and don't know what to do with him. Tf the election could come off to morrow they would repudiate their own offsorinar and come to Southern terms." A friend writes us as follows from Carthage, Moore county : "Yoar course in regard to federal affairs meets with the approbation of the people of this county, so far as I have been able to learn." A friend writes us from Johnsonvillc? Cumber land, as follows : "You will pardon me for expressing my disap probation and indignation at the course of certain caucuses and cliques in their most unjust and un grateful conduct towards you. I need not assure you that Holden has the sympathy of the people in this section. We look to you, sir in this important crisis. We are all for Union under existing cir cumstances." A friend writes us as follows from Burke county : "I trust you will abate nothin? in your fearless and able advocacy of our glorious Union. Lay the lash on those who without good cause would break up the best government ever vouchsafed by God to man." A friend writing from Brinkleyville, Halifax, says: "Your course in these trying times ousrht to meet the approbation of every patriotic citizen of the State. Caucuses, composed of demagogues and hot headed politicians, may try to break you down, but be assured that the strong arm of the people will sustain and support you." A friend in Columbus county, who sends us forty dollars for a club of subscribers, says : "I regret 'hat there are disunionists in this State without sufficient cause : and I also regret to see the Governor of the State recommending disunion sentiments in his message. Gratified at your advo cating stong Union principles, the Union men of Colnmhus will stand on the same rock with you against both disunion and submission." A friend writes us as follows from Leasburg, Cas well county : 44 1 agree with you entirely as to the position you occupy on the topics that are now distracting our oetoved country. I bid you Uod speed in the glori ous work of trying to save our Union from being dashed to pieces on the dangerous rocks of secession and disunion, save for a just cause or causes, which 1 think do not now exist. A friend writes us as follows from shboro, Ran dolph county : 44 The people of this county, with few exceptions. are for the Union. They are not subraissionists. but for a Constitutional I nion. All parties here are endorsing your course, and condemning that of uov. r.ins and his hre-eating followers. 1 write these few words to encourage you in your great work. I have always been a Democrat, but I can't follow such leaders as seem now to be in favor." A friend writes us from Greensboro as follows : 44 We had a great Union meeting here yesterday. Tt was a meeting of the people. None of the Breck inridge leaders went into the meeting, but some of the voters did. As to the Union my motto is. 44 Watch and Wait" and as to the Raleigh oligar chy my motto is, war now, and war to the knife. I am glad to see you keeping up the war for the Con stitution and the Union with so much pluck and power. One of the most intelligent and influential Demo crats in Person county, writes us as follows : "In common with hundreds of others in the State. 1 feel a strong inclination to contribute my feeble aid in holding up vour hands in the arduous struggle in which you are now engaged. Fight on, and fight ever in the cause of the Union. When the present inordinate excitement shall have passed by. you will assuredly meet that just commendation that always awaits a faithful public servant. In this county I do not think disunion could get fifty votes. If the Legislature should call a Convention, Person will send strong Union men to it" A venerable friend in Chatham county writes us as follows : 44 1 approve of your views. T am an old Baptist in my 76th year, and am a Jefferson and Jackson Democrat I am a Union man, and for any man that is for the Union, and against any man that is against the Union. You will please send me your paper. Pour hot shot into the camp of the fire arms. Myself and seven sons will shoulder our. muskets tor the Union, or against Lincoln it he violates the Constitution." We have many more letters in hand, from which we will give extracts hereafter. There can be no doubt as to the feeling of a vast majority of the people of this State. They are opposed to present secession, and in favor of exhausting all Constitu tional remedies before involving themselves in the hazards of secession and revolution. The few fi rep ealing leaders and presses are noisy and fus.-y, but they do not speak for the great body of the people. A Voice from Tennessee. At a mass- meeting of the people of Greene county, Tennessee, held on the 24th of last month, the following among other resolutions was adopted : " Resolved, That we deeply sympathise with our sister Southern States, and freely admit that there is good cause tor dissatisfaction and complaint on their part on account of the recent election of sec tional candidates to the Presidency and Vice-Presi dency of the United States ; yet we as a portion of the people or a slave-holding community, are not for seceding or breaking up the Union of these States until every fair and honorable means have been exhausted in trying to obtain on the part of the non-slaveholding states a compliance with the spirit and letter of the Constitution, and all its guarantees, and when this shall have been done, and the States now in open rebellion against the laws of the Litited States, in refusing to execute the t ugitive slave law, shall persist in their present uncon stitutional course, and the Federal Government shall fail or refuse to execute the laws in good faith, it (the government) will not have accomplished the great design of its creation, and will therefore in fact be a practical dissolution, and all the States as parties be released from the compact which formed the Union. The meeting was ably addressed by Hon. Andrew Johnson in support of the resolutions. The above resolution no doubt embodies his views as to the proper course to be pursued in the present crisis. Personal Liberty Laws. A citizen of Indiana denies, through the Washington Constitution, that that State ever passed a personal liberty law, nulli fying the fugitive slave law. He adds, that in every instance the fugitive law has been promptly en forced in that State. And a citizen of Iowa makes a similar denial as to his State, through the National Intelligencer. Death xr James E. Gibblr, Esr. We regret to learn from the Beaufort Banner that James E. Gib- ble. Esq . the Collector of that port, died suddenly on the 6th instant Mr. Gibble was in his 75th year. He was highly respected and esteemed. PRor. Ansted, the English Geologist, says that the reported number of earthquakes from the earliest ages to 1850, is ever seven thousand. From 1800 to 1850, three thousand two hundred and forty. The average for the present century is about one a week. - The Governor's Newspaper . The State Journal the Governor's' newspaper i is doing all it can to inflame the mindof the people and prepare them Tor civil war. "it declares that "all hope of preserving the Union is at an end." The wish is no doubt father to the thought 1 The Editor of the Journal we beg pardon of the public. the nominal Editor would rejoico over a dissolu tion of the Union, as that has been a part of the British system since the days of John Henry, the hired British emissary, who visited this country on his wicked errand just before the war of 1812. The same paper of to-day says, " We tell our State rights friends that their cause is beset by a bigoted feeling of tame submission ichich has to be met and crushed ouC The same paper also com mands the Legislature to call a Convention. Hon est men, and brave men, who are opposed to present secession, and who still hope that the Union may be preserved, are denounced by this miserable tool of the Governor as "tame submissionists" and the order is given to "crush them out" Webhallsee what comes of this. This is indeed a free country, when such a person is allowed to pursue such a course. Under the oligarchy which the disunion leaders would set up, such language would not be tolerated. God deliver the conservative and patriotic old State of North-Carolina from the con trolf such men ! A part of the plan to "precipitate" disunion is to spread false rumors and false alarms such, for ex ample, as that the North is demanding the abolition of the slave representation in Congress. The gloomy side of letters from distinguished persons is given, while the bright side is suppressed. We caution all good men against the intrigues, the misrepresents tions, and the unholy schemes of the disunion leaders. Rays of Light. It is stated that private letters have been received in Washington from prominent citizens of Georgia and Alabama, indicating more favorable sentiments in relation to the maintenance of the Union. Al though no decided reaction has taken place, there is an evident disposition manifested in influential quar ters to postpone final action on secession, and await the development of public opinion in the border slaveholding States. In addition to this the House committee of thirty three held their first meeting on the 18th, at which favorable action was taken. Mr. Rust, of Arkansas, offered the following resolution : 44 Eesolred, That in the opinion of this Committee the existing discontent among the Southern people and growing hostility on their part towards the Fed eral Government are greatly to bo regretted ; and whether such discontents and hostility arc or are not without just cause, reasonable and proper con stitutional remedies and effectual guarantees for the protection of their peculiar interest as recognized by the national compact, such as are necessary to pre serve the peace of the country and the perpetuity of the Union, should be promptly and cheerfully gran ted." Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, offered an amendment not so favorable to the South as the above, which was rejected, yeas 9, nays 21. Mr. Ferry, of Conn., moved a resolution as a substitute, which was re jected; whereupon the resolution offered by Mr. Rust was adopted by the following vote: Yeas Corwin, Millson, Winslow, Campbell, Love, of Ga., Davis, of Md., Stratton, Bristow, Nelson, Dunn, Taylor, Kellogg, Houston, Phelps, Rust, Howard. Hamilton, Curtis, Burch, Windon and Stout 21. Xays Adams, Humphrey. Robinson, Tappan, Morrill, Morse, Washuurn, and Ferry 8. The committee has made a good beginning. With the aid of the 44 sober-second thought" the Union can be saved. Let us prepare, and then Watch and Wait. An immense mass meeting of Constitutional Union men was held in Philadelphia on the 18th. the Mayor presiding. The City was decorated with flags, the motto of many being, 44 Concession before Secession." It was the largest and most imposing . meeting ever held in that City. The resolutions ! adopted are all that Southern men could desire. For I be Standard. Fatetteviu.e, N. C, Dec. 4, I860. Editor of the Standard: One of the largest and most respectable meetings of the people of the town of Fayctteville and coun ty of Cumberland, took place to-day, to consult and express their opinion in regard to the alarming crisis iti national affairs. The meeting first organized in the court-house, but that building proved too small for the vast throng which had come together, and was adjourned to 44 Farmer's Hall," a room some fifty feet wide by two hundred in length, which soon was crowded. The Hon. Jesse G. Shepherd presided as Presi dent, assisted by Daniel McDiarmid and Joel Wil liams, Esqs., as Vice Presidents, and Messrs. John A. Pemberton and James C. Dobbin acting as Secre taries. The committee on resolutions consisted of one gentleman from each captain's district, and the pre amble and resolutions submitted by them to the meeting were adopted by a large and decisive ma jority, after having been hotly opnosed by a squad of extreme ft re-eaters, and many attempts to anieml. by offering as a substitute the report of two of the dissenting members of the committee, which were no other than the resolutions passed Saturday night a week ago, at what was called a town meeting, ami which were sent in hot haste to the Wilmington Journal, Petersburg Exptess, and other papers, with a great flourish of trumpets, as the embodiment of the opinion of the people of this place. The people of Fayettevillo and Cumberland have now spoken, and the noisy ranting of the small clique who had determined 44 to force their resolu tions through or break up the meeting," found the honest men of the country made of sterner stuff than to be frightened from what they believed to be their duty by so insignificant a body of raw recruits as was marshalled for the fight So sure were these fire-eaters of carrying through the meeting their ex treme notions, that it is said that at a caucus the night before they agreed upon and had prepared a secession flag, which was to have been raised at the close of-the meeting, had they succeeded in passing their resolutions; but thanks to the good sense of the peopie, the plans of these self-constituted apos tles of liberty, (who have nothing at stake, and therefore nothing to lose, let things go as thev may,) were foiled, and their ultraism signally rebuked. You will see from the proceedings of the meeting that every effort was made by this clique to have the "Governor's views" endorsed, but in every shape presented, they were rejected by large ma jorities. You will notice the recommendation in the con cluding resolution adopted, about the re-organization of the militia and the formation of volunteer corps, 44 if, in the opinion of the Legislature, they may deem it necessary." This was consented to by the meeting to soften the fall of the youngsters who, at the conclusion of the meeting, found it very nec essary to be thankful for very small favors. Yours, &.c, B. Tobacco.

REMARKS OF MR. BROWN, OP CASWELIa . Delivered in the 'Senate of Xorth-Carolina, Decerit- her 14, 1860. . ' , Mr. Brown rose to a privileged question. . In his entire legislative experience be bad on no occasion brought to the notice of any body that he bad serv ed in before, any misrepresentation of himself by the press, in debate, although, he bad here and else where been engaged in debating questions which had called forth great excitement He was now in duced to depart fiom that course, from the gross misrepresentations relative to himself which this morning appeared in the State Journal in the report of the debate on the resolutions which he had offer ed to appoint Commissioners to attend the State Convention in South-Carolina. Mr. B. then pro ceeded to read from the State Journal the following remarks : 44 Mr. Avery said, the Senator from Caswell has referred to a communication in some South western paper, written by an unknown person, suggesting the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Did the Senator intend to leave the impression on the mind of the Senate, that the States rights party, or any single member of that party, looked to any such change in. our system of government in the South? if so, he grossly slanders that party and misrepresents its purposes and objects. The move ment now going on with a view to secession, origin ates in a desire to escape sectional domination and tyranny, and to preserve, pure and intact our pres ent institutions; The Senator docs not himself be lieve the charge, and he will not say he docs no one believes it; it is thrown out for effect and with a view to create prejudice against those of us who are boldly maintaining the rights of the South." The misrepresentation and gross injustice which he complained of was that certain words therein used were not uttered by the Senator from Burke in his hearing. He had consulted some half dozen Senators who were present, and every one had said they had heard no such language. Again, after the remarks of the Senator from Burke (Mr. Avery,) had been made, he (Mr. B.) had promptly risen at the moment the Senator from Burke had resumed his seat and asked him 44 if he had in the course of his remarks intended to impute to him.any improp er or dishonorable motive in what he bad said." The Senator -from Burke, in reply to the inquiry of Mr. B., said that he would assure the Senator from Caswell that he did not intend any such imputation, and that if he had so intended, be should have ex pressed it frankly. What he, Mr. B., again complained of, was that the Reporter of the State Journal had suppressed his (Mr. B's) inquiry, and the disclaimer of any im putation by the Senator from Burke, thus making the impression that he had been silent, and leaving an inference injurious to him. He would make no comments on what appeared to be deliberate and in tentional injustice by that Journal. Mr. Avery said in reply that the words given in the report of his remarks were given as he recol lected them. They were not such as conveyed any imputation on the Senator from Caswell, as he had expressly qualified them by saying, at the time, that he did not believe the Senator from Caswell enter tained the belief that such were the opinions of the State rights party. Mr. B. Raid he had heard no such language the half dozen Senators whom he had consulted, said they had heard no such language ; and any Senator using language of that kind would no doubt have been called to order by the presiding officer. He, however, would not enter on any further issue on that question, as the interpretation just given by the Senator from Burke disclaiming any offensive meaning, and the disclaimer which he bad made at the time of the debate of any intention to reflect on the motives of him, Mr. Brown, relieved him from the necessity of further remark. Mr. B. concluded by saying that he bad consid ered it due to himself to make the statement which he had done to show the injust'ee which had been done him by the State Journal, in suppressing the disclaimer made by the Senator from Burke, at the time of the debate, and leaving the unjust inference that no explanation at the time had been called for or received. After a few. more words of explanation, further remarks were discontinued.
