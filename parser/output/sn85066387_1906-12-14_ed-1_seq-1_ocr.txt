The Senator's cpeerh was a caustic arraignment of MnrmonUra and what he described aa the President** attitude toward that or ganization. He spoke for three hours knd held xhf do** attention of Senators. Dubols declared that Mormonltm wa« the only l»mr In Idaho last fall, and »et the President sent Secretary Taft Into that State to talk for "law and order."* Dubois went into the history of the Mormon church, its relation to elec tions in the States where it was strong est and declared that the destruction of the influence of the church !n politics would accomplish more toward wiping out polygamy than anything else Speaking of the Idaho incident he said !n part: / "XVhen Governor Gooding of Idaho and the chairman of the Republican State committee were engaged in citing taw-breaking -and - law-defying* Mor mons to additional lawlessness,: tn"e President of the United States sent" his Secretary of -"War 'intoildaho~ to plead tvith the people .to stand by Governor Qooding in order to maintain law and order In Idaho. .* 

CALLS IT TN-A3IERICA.V* "The non-Mormon citizenship of Utah and Idaho think they are entitled to the support of law-abiding citizens everywhere in their efforts to maintain American citizenship in these Mormon States, and if they - annot receive that I they have the right to demand that the President of the United States shall not use the great power vested in him tn the interest of these law-defying, and un-American organizations in their fletermination to rule the politics of this section." . ' Polygamous relations were being sustained, Dubois said, by President Joseph Smith and a majority' of the twelve apostles. Polygamists, he said, occupy the highest positions politically and In the church, an constitute the wealthiest and most powerful mem bers of the church organization. Polit ically, he said, the Mormon .church has absolute sway In Utan and is extending Its control into Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon. As to Senator Smoot, he said, it made no difference whether he was or was hot a polygamist. The Senator was a pillar in the church and in control of Its temporal, spiritual and political pol icies, and was selected ror the Senate because of his position in the church. "Smoot,""*, he added, "represents the thurch and not the State and would fio the bidding of the church before be would cerve the real interests of the State or the nation. By being an tpostle of the church Smoot . is one of the chief conspirators and' by his ac quiescence supports the plans and aims tf the conspiracy." \.V Turning his attention to the cam paign preceding the recent election, Dubois read the press dispatches of October 22, which stated that the Pres ident had sent Secretary Taft to Idaho tn order to speak in advocacy of . law fend order. At that time, Duboiu said, be had telegraphed to the President that the only . issue was the desire of the Mormon hierarchy to continue to dominate the politics of the State and that the President had been misled if he thought there was any other Issue. Dubois referred to messages of Pres idents Buchanan, . Johnson, Grant, Hayes, Garfleld. Arthur and Cleveland, citing what he termed "the menace of Uormonism" and proceeded: ' *'I call attention to the messages of the Presidents for two 'purposes— one Indicates the views of ourfflrmer ex-; ecutlves, the other to mark the con trast between them and the present occupant of the White House. Moi> monism is more -insidious, more dan gerous and a greater menace to our Government and civilization today than It was at; any particular, period: when these messages were addressed to Con gress.

WASHINGTON', Dec. .13.— .President Roosevelt 'in the message that he will transmit! to Congress next Tuesday on the report : of \u25a0• Secretary -Metcnlf on Japanese school and ' labor conditions in California, will, it is said, take .'the most advanced ground In favor of cen tralization of power in the Federal Government- that '. he has , yet occupied. It i« «nid that the speech of Secretary Root In Xew York last. night, which at tracted so much attention, was but. the forerunner of this message, and., that the President, wyi- no. longer occupy any' middle ground as (o the right of the Federal Government^© be supreme, in Tall matters in which . the affairs of foreign countries or the welfare of the American" people-* are concerned. In doing this the President' will meet the attack made on his policy by Sen ator Rayner Maryland in* the Sen ate 1 yesterday. In' this connection it is said that having definitely and^flnal ly settled in" his, own mind .that he will! be able .to combat the efforts. of .those \ who would make, him take, a'second I nomination:" the .Presidency, *he. throws^' J p6lit^al!-.iexsedien*cy v K^t6Vr^the winds- ana 7 wil 1 -.com c (out * as - ; an j advoV cate-in its broadest sense, of, the- power of \u25a0 the rFedferal jGoVernment . to"i handle not only Questions connected.with other countries 'where their rights are. con cerned, but alsp_ other ] questions of Ta domestic character which concern the entire nation. • In this way" the President will shove to one side petty and minor mat ters and open up -the broadest discus sion of the rights of the federation of States that has prevailed in this coun try since the adoption of the Federal constitution, /it is not to be under stood tHat he will be writing upon the subject of treatment of the. Japanese at all. So far as diplomacy is concerned, that question is being settled. ' . He will use the Japanese incident to point the moral he Is to bring to the door of the Senate. It Is said that speech of Secretary. Root can be taken as "a good index to. the character of discussion which the President will pre cipitate upon Congress. "It is also predicted that there will be more mes sage's from the President than .were ever delivered, at a short session, and the' country will be given ample food for thought.' -
