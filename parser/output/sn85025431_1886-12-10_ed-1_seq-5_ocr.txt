HE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE President Oleveland Submits HIB Second Annnnl Message to Congress. •merfoa at Peace with Every 0ther Nation in the Civ­ ilized World. Special Attention Called to the Extradition Treaties -with Va­ rious Foreign Powers. The Relation of Labor and Cap­ ital Treated in a States­ manlike Manner. Recommendations that the Rev­ enue Laws be Modified and Amended. The Work of Fortifying Certain Of Our Large Cities Should Be Begun at Once. The Navy in a Most Lamentable Condition—Congress Must Act Promptly. A Government Penitentiary Needed for Incarcerating United States Prisoners. The Subjects of Indian Treatment and Education Exhaustively Considered. The following is .President Cleveland's message to congress: To the Congress of the United States: •. In discharge of a constitutional duty and following a well-established precedent in the executive office, 1 herewith transmit to con­ gress at the reassembliag, certain information I concerning the state of the union together with such recommendations for legislative consideration as appear necessary and exped­ ient. Our government has consistently main­ tained Its relations of friendship toward all Other powers and of neighborly interest toward those whose possessions are conting nous to oar own. Few questions have arisen during the past year with other governments, and none of these are beyond the reach of settlement In friendly counsel. We are as yet without provision for the settlement of claims of citizens of the "United States against Chili for injuries during the lato war with Peru and Bolivia. The mixed commissions, organized under claims conventions, conceeded by the Chili govern­ ment with certain European states, have de­ veloped an amonnt of friction which we trust 'can be avoided in the convention in which our representative at Santiago is authorized to negotiate. The cruel treatment ef inoffensive Chinese, has, I regret to say, been repeated in 1 tome of the far western states and territories, and acts of violence against the power of the local constituted authorities to prevent and difficult to punish, are reported even in distant Alaska. Much of this violence can be traced to race prejudice and competi­ tion of labor, which cannot, however, justify the oppression o£ strangers whose safety is guaranteed by OUR 

TREATY WITH CHINA equally with the most favored nations. In opening our vast domain to alien elements the purpose of our law givers was to invite assimi­ lation and not to provide an arena for endless antagonisms. The paramonnt duty of main­ taining public order and defending the inter­ ests of our people muy require the adoption of measares of restriction, but they Should not tolerate the oppression of individuals of a special race I am not without aesmanco that the government of China, whose friendly disposition towards us I am most happy to recognize, will meet ns half way in demising a comprehensible remedy by which an effective limitation of Chinese emigration, joined to protection of those Chinese subjects who re­ main in this country, may be secured. Legis­ lation is needed to execute the provisions of our Chinese convention of 1880 touching the opium traffic. While the good will of the Columbian government towards our country Js manifest, the situation of American inter­ ests on the Isthmus of Panama has at times elicited concern, and invited friendly action looking to the performance of the engage­ ments of the two nations, ctucerning the territory embraced in the iXTEK-OCliAN TRANSIT. With the subsidence of the Isthmian dis­ turbances and the erection of the state of Panama into a federal district, nnler the di­ rect government of the constitutional adminis­ tration a' Bogota, a new order of things has been inaugurated which, although as yet somewhat experimental and affording scope for arbitrary exercise of power, by the dele gates or the national authority,promises much, improvement Toe sympathy between the people of the United States aud France, born during our colonial struggle for independence and continuing today, bus received a fr sh im­ pulse IU the inceessful completion and dedi­ cation of the colo.-sal sta'ue of -'Liberty En­ lightening the World" in New York harbor, the girt of Frenchmen to Americans. A con­ vention between the United States and cer­ tain other powers for the protection of sub­ marine cables was signed at Paris on Aiarch 14, 1884, and has been duly ratified ana pro­ claimed by thn government. By agree­ ment between the high contracting parties this convention is to go into effect the first of January next bnt the legislation re quired for Hs execution iu the United States has not yet been adopted. I earnestly recom­ mend its enactment Cases have continued to occur in Germany giving rise to much cor­ respondence in relation to the privilege of so­ journ of our naturalized citizens of German origin revisiting the land of their birth, yet I am happy to state that our relations with that country have lost none of their ACCUSTOMED COItDUHTT. The claims for interest upon the amount of tonnage dues illegally exacted from certain German steamship lines were favorably re­ ported ia both houses of congress at the last session, and I trust will receive final and favor­ able afitlBh at an earl v. CANAOI N I S»HERIES. The Question Elaborately Discussed and Recommendations Made. The recommendation contained in my last annual message in relation to a mode of settle­ ment of the fishery rights in the waters of British North America, so long a subject of anxious difference between the United States and Great Britain, was met by an adverse vote of the senate April 13 last, and thereupon ne­ gotiations were instituted to obtain an agree­ ment with her Britannic majesty's government for the promulgation of such in­ terpretation and definition of the article of the convention of 1818, relating to the territorial waters and inshore fisheries of the British provinces as shonld se­ cure the Canadian rights from encroachment by United States fishermen, and at the same tlmo insure enjoyment by the latter of the privileges guaranteed to them by such con vention. The questions involved are of long standing and of grave conscquenc and from time to time for oeaily three-quarters of a century have given rise to earnest inter­ national discussions, not unaccompanied by irre/ation. Temporary arrangements by treaties hf/e seemed to allav friction, which, however, bas asain risen as each treaty was terminated^ The "last arrangement under the treaty of 1S7I was abrogated after due notice by the United States on June 80, 1SS3 bnt I was en­ abled to obtain for oar fishermen for the re­ mainder of that season ei joy ment of the FUIX PRIVILEGES accorded by the terminating treaty. The joint commission by whom the treaty bad been negotiated, although invested with plenary power to make a permanent settle- meat, were content with a temporary arrange­ ment, after the termination of which the ques­ tion was relegated to the stipulations of the treaty of 1818, aa to tke first article of which no construction satisfactory to both conntries has ever been agreed npon. The progress of civilization and growth of popula­ tion in the British provinces, to which the fisheries in question are contiguous, and the expansion of commercial intercourse between them and the United States present today a condition of affairs scarcely realizable at the date of the negotiations of 1618, New and vast interests have been brought into existence, modes of intercourse between the respective conntries hare been invented and 'multiplied, the methods of conducting the fisheries have been wholly changed, and all this is necessarily entitled to candid and careful consideration in the adjustment of the terms and conditions of Intercourse and commerce between the United States and their neighbors along a frontier of over 3,500 miles. This propinquity, community of langnage and occupation, and similarity of political and social institutions, indicate the practicability and obvious wisdom of maintaining mutually beneficial and friendly relations. Whilst I am unfeignedly desirous that such relations should exist between ns and the inhabitants of Canada, yet TUB 

ACTION or THEIR OFFICIALS during the past season toward our fishermen has been snch as ta seriously threaten their efforts to secure a satisfactory settlement of the fishery question. Negotiations are still pending, with reasonable hope that before the close of the present session' of congress ad* vancement may be made and acceptable con­ clusions reached at an early day. There may be laid before congress the correspondence of the department of state in relation to thiB im­ portant subject, so that the history of the past fishing season may be fully disclosed and the action and the attention of the admin­ istration closely comprehended. More ex­ tended reference is not deemed necessary in this communication 

WITH OTHER POWERS. Speolai Attention Directed to tbe Hawaiian Islands and Japan* The recommendation submitted last year, that provision he made for a preliminary reconnoissance of the conventional boundary line between Alaska and British Columbia, is renewed. I express my unhesitating convic­ tion that the Intimacy of relation with Hawaii should be emphasized. As a result of the reciprocity treaty of 1875, those islands, on the highway of Oriental and Australian tiafile are virtually an outpost of American commerce and a stepping stone to the growing trade of the Pacific. The Polynesian island groups have been so ab­ sorbed by other and more powerful govern­ ments, that the Hawaii Islands are left almost alone in the enjoyment of autonomy which it is important for ns should tbe preserved. Our treaty is now terminable on one year's notice, bat propositions to abrogate it wonld be in my judgement, most ill-advised. The para­ mount influence we have there acquired, once relinquished, could only with difficulty be regained, and a valuable coign of vantage for ourselves might be converted into a stronghold for our commercial competi­ tors. I earnestly recommend that existing treaty stipulations be extended for a further term of seven years. A recently signed treaty to this end is now before the senate. The im­ portance of telegraphic communication be­ tween these islands and the United States should not be overlooked. The question of a general revision of the TREATIES OF JAPAN, is again under discussion at Toklo. As the first open relations with that empire and as the nation is in most direct commercial rela­ tion with Japan, the United States bas lost no opportunity to testify their consistent friend­ ship by supporting tbe just claims of Japan to autonomy and independence among nations. A treaty of extradition between the United States and Japan, the first conducted by that empire, has been lately proclaimed. The weakness of Liberia and the diffi­ culty of maintaining effective sover­ eignty over its outlying disncts have exposed that republic to encroachment. It cannot be forgotten that this distinct com­ munity is an offshoot of our own system, owing its origin to the associated benevolence of American citizens, whose praiseworthy efforts to create a nucleus of civilization in the Dark Continent have commanded respect and sympathy everywhere, especially in this country. Although a formal protectorate over Liberia id contrary to our traditional policy, the moral right and duty of the United States to assist in all proper ways in the maintenance of its integrity, is obvious, and has been consistent'-y announced during nearly half a certury. I recommend that, in the reorganization of our navy, a small vessel, no longer found adequate to our needs, be presented To Liberia to be employed by it in the protection of its coast wise revenues, jraxico. Tbe encouraging development of beneficial and intimate relations between the United States and Mexico, which has been so marked within the past few years, is at once the occa­ sion of congratulation and of friendly solici­ tude. I urgently renew my former repre­ sentation ot the need of speedy legislation by congress to carry into effect the reciprocity commercial convention of January 20, 1883. Our commercial treaty of 1831 with Mexico was terminated according to its provision?, in 1881, upon notification uiven by Mexico in pursuance of her announced policy of recasting all her commercial treaties. Mex­ ico has since concluded with several foreign governments new treaties of commerce and navigation defining alien rights of trade, prop­ erty and residence, treatment of ehippi ig, con­ sular privileges and the like. Our yet unex­ ecuted reciprocity convention of 1S83 covers none of these points, the settlement of which is nece-sary to good relationship. I propose to initiate with Mexico negotiations for a new and changed treaty of commerce and naviga­ tion. CUTTING'S CASE. In compliance with a resolution of the senate I communicated to that body on August 2 last, andalsoto the house of representatives, the correspondence in the case of A. N. Cutting, an American citizen then imprisoned in Mexico charged with the commifsion of a penal of­ fense in Texas, of which a Mexican citizen was the object. After demand had been made for hi9 release the charge against him was amended so as to include a violation of Mex­ ican law within Mexican territory. This joinder of alleged offences, one within and the oth«»r exterior to Mexico, induced me to order special investigation of tbe case pending when Mr. Cutting Was released. The incident has, however, disclosed a claim of jurisdiction by Mexico novel in our history whrteby any offense committed anywhere, and of which a Mexican is tbe object, may, if the offender be found in Mexico, be there tried and punished in conformity to Mexican laws. Jurisdiction was sustained by the courts of Mexico in the Catting case and approved by the executive branch of the government. Upon the authority of Mexican statutes the appellate conrt in releasing Mr. Cutting, decided that the abandonment of tbe complaint by the Mexican citizens aggrieved by the alleged crime (a libelous publication), removed the basis of further prosecution aud also declared justice to have been satisfied by the enforce­ ment of asmall part of the original sentence. The admission of such a pretension wonld be attended with serious results, invasive of the jurisdiction of tbe government and highly dangerous to our citizens in foreign lands. Therefore I have denied it, and protested against its attempted exercise as un­ warranted by tbe principle of law and international usages. A soveriegn has jurisdiction of offences which take effect within his territory, although concerted or commenced outside it but the right is denied of any fore'sn sovereign to puniih a citizen of the United States for an offense committed on our soil, even though the offense be against a subject or citizen of such sovereign. The Mexican statute in question makes the claim bodily, and the principle, if conceded, wouid create a dual responsibility in tbe citizen and lead to confusion of that certainty in law which is AS ESSENTIAL OF LIBTSISTT. When citizens of the Uuitad States voluntar­ ily go into a fereign country, they must abide by the laws there in force, and will not be protected by their owa government from the consequences of an offense aeainst those laws committed, such foreign country. But the watchful care and interest of this government over its cU'zens are not relinquished because they have gone abroad, and if charged with crime committed in the foreign land, a fair and open trial, conducted with decent regard 3XJF3PL.ESMHSNT. for justice and humanity will be demanded for them. With less than that, this gov­ ernment will not be COB tent, when the life or liberty of Its citizens is at stake, whatever the degree to which the extradition of criminal jurisdiction may have been for­ merly allowed by consent and reciprocal agree­ ment among certain of the European states. No snch doctrine or practice was ever known to the laws of this country, or of that from which erir institutions have mainly been de­ rived. In the case of Mexico there are rea­ sons especially strong for perfect tarmony in the mutual exercises of jurisdiction. Nature bas made ns irrevocably neighbors, and wis­ dom and kind feeling should make ns friends. The overflow of cap­ ital and enterprise from these United 8tates is a potent factor in assisting the development of the resources of Mexico and In building up the property of both conntries. To assist this good work all grounds of apprehension for the security of person and property shonld be removed, and I trust that in the interests of good neighbor­ hood tbe statute referred to will be so modified as to eliminate present possibilities of danger to the peace of the two couutries. THE 

NETHERLANDS. The government of the Netherlands bas ex­ hibited concern in relation to certain features of our tariff laws, which are supposed by them to be aimed at a class of tobacco producers in the duties imposed. Comment would seem unnecessary upon the unwisdom of legislation appearing to have a special national discrim­ ination for its object which, although unin­ tended, may give rise to injurious relations. The establishment less than four years ago of a legation at Teheran is bearing fruit in the interest exhibited by tbe Shah's govern­ ment in the industrial activity of tbe United States. Tne opportunities of benefit to our goyernment are now happily restored in Peru by the election of a constitutional president, and a period of rehabilitation is entered upon. Recovery is necessarily slow from the exhaus­ tion caused by the late war and civil disturb­ ances. A convention to adjust by arbitration claims of our citizens has been promised and is under consideration. The naval officer who bore to Siberia the testimonials bestowed by congress in recogni­ tion of the aid given to THB 

JIANETTE 8UBVIVOK9 has successfully accomplished his mission. His interesting report will be submitted. It is pleasant to know that this mark of apprecia­ tion has been welcomed by the Russian gov­ ernment and people as befits the traditional friendship of tbe two countries. Civil perturbations in the Samoan Islands have, during the past few years been a source of considerable embarrassment to the three governments of Germany, Great Britain and the United States, whose relations and extra territorial rights in that important group are guaranteed by treaties. The weakness of the native administration and the conflict of op­ posing interests in the Islands have led King Malietoa to seek alliance or protection in some one quarter, regardless of the distinct engage­ ments whereby no one of the three treaty powers may acquire any paramount or exclu­ sive interest. In May last Malietoa offered to place Samoa under the protection of the United States, and tbe late consul, without authority, assumed to grant it. The proceed­ ings were promptly disavowed and the over zealous official recalled. Spccial agents of tbe three governments have been deputized to examine the situation in the islands, with a change in the representation of all three powers and a unanimous understanding be tween them. The peace, prosperity, automa­ tons administration and neutrality of Samoa can hardly fail to be se­ cure d. SPAHT. It appearing that the eovcrnment of Spain did not extend to the flag of the United States in the Antilles the whole measure of reciprocity requisite under our statutes for the continu­ ance of the suspension of discriminations against the Spanish flag in our ports. I was constrained in October last to rescind my pre­ decessor's proclamation of February 14, 1834, permitting such suspension. An ar rangement was, however, t-pecdiiy reached, aud upon notification from the government or Spain that all differential respect of our ves­ sels and their cargoes from the United States or from any foreign country had been completely and absolutely relinquished, I availed myself of the ciscretiou conferred by law and issued, on the 27th of October, my proclamation declauog reciprocal suspension in the United sta'es. It is most gratifying to bear testimony to the earnest spirit in which the government of the Queen regent has met our efforts to avert the initia­ tion of commercial discrimination and re­ prisals which are ever disastrous to the ma­ terial interests and the political guod will of the countries they may effect. The profitable development of tbe large commercial ex­ changes between the United States and the Spanish Antilles is naturally a.i object of solicitude. CUBA AND rctr.TO RICO. Lying close at our door?, and finding here their rauin markets of supply and demand, tho welfare of Cuba aud Porto Rico and their pro­ duction and trade are scarcely less important t,0 US than to Soain. Their commercial aud financial movement- are so naturally a part of our system that no obstacle to fur.lier freer intercourse should be permitted to exist. Th» standing instructions ui our representatives at Madrid "and Havana have for years been to leave no effort uncssayed to further these cuds, and at no time wa? the equal good desire of Spain more hopefully manifested than now The government of Spam thus removing the consular tonnage fee? on cargoes (hi ped to the Antilles, and by reducing passport fees has shown i's recognizance of need of ess trammelled intercourse. An effort has been made during the pa -t year to r.'tuovo the hindrance to the proclamation of the treaty of naturalization with the subl me Porte signed in 1874, which has remained inoperative ow­ ing to a disagreement of interpretation of the clauses relative to the effects of the rciurn to and sojourn of a natural issue of cities in the laud of origin. I trust soon to be able to an­ nounce a favorable settlement of the differ­ ences as to this interpretation. It has been highly catisfactory to note the improved treatmeut of American mis.-ior.aries in Turkey, as has been attested by'heir acknowledgments to our late minister to that government of his snccessf al exertions in their behalf. Tbe exchange of ratification of the conven­ tion of Decembers, 18S5, with Venzuela for the reopening of the awards of the Caraccas commission, under the claims convention of 1S815, hfis not yet Veen effected, owing -to the delay of the executive of that republic in rati­ fying the measure. I tru«t that this post­ ponement will be brief bnt should it much longer continue, the delay may as well be re­ membered as a recession of the com­ pact aud a failure on the part of Venzuela to complete an arrangement so persistently sought by her during many years and assent­ ed to by this government in a spirit of inter­ national fairness, although to tbe detriment of holders of bona fide awards of the impugned commission. 1 renew the recommendation of my last an­ nual message that existing legislation con­ cerning citizenship and naturalization, be re­ vised. We have treaties with many states providing for the renunciation of citizenship by naturalized aliens, but no statute is found to give effect to such engagements,- nor any which provides a needed central bureau for the registratiDn of p»,nr*'iz«nl citizens. EXTRADITION AfD COPYRIGHTS. Oar Statutes on These Subjects Need Judicious Amendment. Experience suggests that onr statutes regu 'ating extradition might be advantageously amended by a provision for the transit across our territory, now aconTenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign country to another, of fugitives surrendered by a foreign givernment to a third state. Such provisions are nssal in the ltgis'ation of other countries, and tend to prevent miscarrying of justice. It is also de­ sirable to remove the present obstacles that authority should be conferred on the secre­ tary of state to Ifcue a certificate in case of an arrest, for tne purpose of extra it ion to the officer before whom the proceed­ ings are pending,showing that a requisition tar the person charged has been duly made. Such a certificate, if required to be received before tbe prisoner's examination, would prevent a long and expensive judicial inquiry into a charge which the foreign government might not desire to press. I also recommend that express provision be made for tbe immediate discharge from custody of persons committed for extradition, where the presi­ dent is of the opinion that surrender shonld' not be made. This drift of sentiment in civilized communities toward full recognition of the rights of property in the creations of tho ho­ rn an intellect, has brought about tbe adoption, by many important nations, of an international copyright convention which was signed at Bene on the 18th of Sept. 1885. Inasmuch as the constitution gives to congress the power "to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right, to their respective writings. and discoveries this government did not feel war­ ranted in becoming a signatory pending the action of congress npon measures of interna­ tional copy-rigbt now before it, bnt the right of adhesion to tbe Berne convention hereafter bas been reserved. I trust the subject will re­ ceive at your hands the attention it deserves, and that the just claims of authors, so urgent­ ly pressed, will be duly beeded. Representa­ tions continue to be made to me of tbe injur­ ious effects upon American artists studying abroad, and having free access to the art col­ lections of other conntries, of maintaining a discriminating duty against the introduction of the works of their brother artists of other countries and I am Induced to repeat my recommendation for tho abolition of that tax. THE 

CONSULAR SERVICE. Increase In Salaries commended for Minis tern ana Consuls. Pursuant to a provision of the Diplomatic and Consular Appropriation Act. approved July 1, 18S6, the estimates submitted by th9 Secretary of State for the maintenance of the consular service have been recast on tbe basis of salaries for all officers to whom snch allow­ ance is deemed a visible advantage. Ad­ vantage has been taken of this to redistribute the salaries of the officers now appropriated for in accordance with work performed, the importance of t&e representative duties of the incumbent, and the cost of living at each post. The last consideration has been too often lost sight of in the allow­ ance heretofore made. The compensation wbieh may suffice for the decent maintenance of a worthy and capable officer in a position of onerous and representative trust, at a poat readily accessible, and where the necessaries of life are abundant and cheap, may prove an inadequate pittance in distant lands, where the better part of a year's pay is consumed in reaching the post of dnt.y, and where the comforts of orainary civil­ ized existence can only be obtained with difficulty and at exorbitant cost. I trust that in considering the snbmitted schedules no mistaken theory of economy will perpetuate a system which in the past has virtually closed to deserving talent many offices where capac­ ity and attainments of a high order arc Indis­ pensable. ang in not a few instances has brought discredit on our national character aud entailed embarrassment and even Buffer­ ing on those deputed to uphold onr dignity and interests abroad. In connection wKh this subject I earnestly reiterate the practical ne­ cessity of supplying some mode of trust­ worthy inspection and report of the manner in which the consulates arc conducted. In the absence of such reliable information, efficiency can scarcely be rewarded or its opposite cor­ rected. Increasiug competition in trade has directed attention to the value of the consular reports printed by the department of stale, and the efforts of the government to extend the practical usefulness of these reports have created a wider demand for them at home and a spirit of emnlation abroad, constituting a record of the changes occurring in trade and of tbe progress of tbe arts aDd inveutioas in foreign countries. They are much sought for by all interested in the subjects which they embrace. SECRETARY OF TH£ TREASURY. Special Attention of Congress Directed to the Internal Rtveaua Laws. The report of the sccriHary of the treasury exhibits in detail tho condition of the public finance and of tbe several branches of the gov­ ernment related to hid department. I especi­ ally direct the attention of the congress to tho recommendation contained in this aud the last preceding report of the secretary touching the simplification and ame d.nent of the laws re­ lating to tbe collection.ot our revenues, and in the interest of economy aud justicy to the gov­ ernment, I hope they may be adopted by ap­ propriate legislation.

In my last annual message to congress at­ tention was directed to tbe fact that the reven­ ues of the government exceeas its actual needs, and it was suggested that legislative action shonld be taken to relieve the people from the unnecessary burden of taxation thus made apparent. In view of the pressing importance of the sabject, I deem it my duty to again urge its coasidera tion. The income of the government, with its increased volume and thorough economies in its collection, is now more than ever ia ex­ cess of public necessities. The application ot the surplus to the payment of snch portion of the public debt as is now at oar option, sub­ ject to extinguishment, if continued at the rate which has lately prevailed, wonld retire that class of indebtedness within less than one year from this date. Thus a continua­ tion ot our present revenue would soon result in the reeeipt of an annual income much greater than necessary to meet govern­ ment expenses, with no indebtedness upon which it could be applied. We sheald then be confronted with a vast quantity of money the circulating medium of the people, hoarded in the treasury when it should be in their hands or we should be drawn into wasteful public extravaganfe with all the corrupting national demoralization which follows in its train. But it is not the simple existence of the surplus and its threatened^ attendant evils, which furnish the strongest argument against onr present scale of 

7KDERAL TAXATION. Its worst phase is the exaction ot such a feurplus through a perversion ot the relations between the people and their government—a dangerous departure from the rules which limit the right of federal taxation. Gesd government, of which every American citizen boasts, has for its objects the protection of every person within its borders with the greatest liberty consistent with the good of the country, and his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earn­ ings, with the least possible diminution for the public needs. When more of the people's sustenance is exacted through the fotm of taxation than is necessary to meet the just demands ot the government, and the expense of its economical administration, such action becomes ruthlxss extortion, aad a viola­ tion of the lundamental principles of a free government. The indirect manner in which these exactions arc made has a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a stage of superfluous revenue, which has aroused the people to a realization of tbe fact that the amount raised professedly for the support ot the government is paid by them as absolutely, if added to the price of the things which supply their daily wants, as if it was paid at fixed periods into tbe hands of the tax-gatherer. Those who toil for daily wages are beginning tc under­ stand that capital, though sometimes vaunt­ ing its importance and clamoring tor the pro­ tection and favor of the government, is dull and sluggish till, toned by THE MAGICAL WAND OF LABOR, it springs into activity, and furnishing an oc­ casion for federal taxation and gaining the value which enables it to bear its burden, and the laboring man is thoughtfully inquiring whether in these circumstances, and considering tbe tribute he constantly pays into the public treasnry as he supplies his daily wants, he re­ ceives his fair share of advantages. There 1J also a suspicion abroad that the surplus of our revenues indicate abnormal and excep­ tional tuK'iness profits, which, under the sys­ tem which produces such surplus, increases, without corresponding benefit to tbe people at large, t' se vast accumulations of a f.-w among our citizens whose fortunes, rivalling the. wealth of tbe most favored in anti-democratij nations, are not the natmal growth of a steady, plain and industrious republic. Our farm­ er*, too, and those engaged directly and indirectly in supplying the productd of ngri culture see that iy by day, and as often as the daily wants of their households recur, they are forced to pay excessive and nteuless taxation, while their products struggle iu for­ eign markets with tho competition of nations which, by allowing a freer exchange of pro­ ductions than wj permit., eu b'o their people to ecll for price? which oistn-M THE AMLltUWN L'A!:Mt:ti. /.q every patriotic c.iti/.en rejoices in the con­ stantly increasing pride ot our people in American titizeii-liiji. a: in the glory of our national achievements and piogress, a sonti ment prevails th the leading »triiigsn-: ful to a nation iri its iufnncy may well, lo a great extent, be dfccimit-d in the present stage of American ingenuity, couri.ge. tnid fearless Belf-teliance tv.d fr the piivili of indulg­ ing lb is seiiiincnt with tvr.e Am-: emhas ia#m onapeople arc qui'e wiiliiu to forego an idle fijrjBus in the public trea.-ury and all the people know that the s.vqr ige rati: of fed­ eral taxation upon isj i« tola, in time of peace, »ut lit'ie k-.-s, while upon come ar­ ticles of necessary con-nmption it is actually more, than was imposed by ttie grio? ous bnrden willingly borne at a tijno when the government deeded niiHiii« to maiutilin by war the safety trad in teariiy of tlw Hfitvs. it has been the policy vl the governisie: '. to collect, the princi­ pal part of its rev.-'.iu, rt »y a tax upoti imp )it and no cn .ng-s in tlii «!iey is dei~ir.iti!H Hut the p'esem condition of tff.iirs const'inns onr people lo demand th:it by a revision of our levcniitj 1 iw* the recei .t.- of the government shall be reduCM! to the w.-es.-ttrydcxpen»c «»f its ci-imoiuii-di txui.iniytritinn, arid this demand j-'.mnid ice and obeyed by the peo p.e's ft-pioien'a'ive-i:i tho legis.'e ive branch of the government.

But if the public good recjuiics it, they should bo content with such consideration as shall deaf fairly and cau­ tiously with their interests, while the jest de­ mands of the people for relief from needless taxation is honestly answered, a reasonable and limely submission to such a demand shouid certainly be possible 

WITHOUT DtHASTitOOS SHOCK to any interest and a cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth of impatience and delayeu justice. Due repard should be also accorded in any proposed readjustment to the interests of American labor so far as they are involved. We congratulate ourselves that there is among n8,no laooring class, fixea within unyielding bounds, and doomed under all conditions to the inexorable fate of daily toil. We recog­ nize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of tbe republic, and we t^at those who have it in heir keeping as citizens, en­ titled to the most carefnl regard and thoughtful attention. This regard and atten­ tion should be awarded them, not only because labor is the capital of our workiogmen, justly entitled to its share of government favor, but for tbe further and not less impoitant reason, that the laboring man, surrounded by his family in bis humble home, as a consumer, is vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of living and enables him to bri: within hit domicile addiditionai comforts and advantages. This relation of the workiagman to tbe rev­ enue la vs of the country and the manner In which it palpably influences the question of wages should not be forgotten in the justifi­ able prominence given to tbe proper main­ tenance of the supply and protection of well paid labor. And these considerations suggest snch an arrangement of government revenues as shall REDUCE THE EXPERSSOF LIVISO, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work, nor reduce the compensation of Ameri­ can labor and injuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it holds in tbe estima­ tion of our people. But oar farmers and agri­ culturists, ttiose who from the soil produce the things consumed by all, are perhaps mo'C directly and plainly concerned than any other i.i our citizens in a ju«t and carefnl sys­ tem of federal taxation. Tbose actually engaeed in and more raaiotely connected with this kind ot work, no in her nearly one-half of onr population. N ne labor harder or more continuously than they. No enactments lim­ it tbeir hoars of toil, and no Interposition of the government enhances to any great extent the value of their products. Aud y« t. for many of the necessaries and comforts of life, which tbe most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes, and for their implement* of husbandry, they are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit, w&&h, by the action ot tho government, ia gftfei^to the more favored manufacturer. I Mom mend that, keeping in view all these conatdwr ations, the Increasing and unnecessary surplus of national income annually accumulating be released to the people by an amendment ot our revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price ot the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported materials as by American labor may be manufactured into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accompHahtd, however, in the direction of this much-needted reform unless the subject is approached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the interests of the entire country, and with a willingness t» yield something for the public good. TBS PUBLIC DBBT. The snm paid npon the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 3U, 1886, was $44.* 551,043.36. During the IS months ended Oct. 31, 1886, 3 per cent, bonds were callqd for redemption amounting to $127,883,100* 6f which $80,643,200 was to answer the require­ ments ot law relating to the sinking fond, and $466,399 for the purpose of reducing the pub­ lic debt by application of a part of the snrplus in the treasury to that oajeet. Of the bonds thus called $108,269,450 became subject wader such calls to redemption prior to November-1, 1886. The remainder, amounting to $8fc„M3, 65u, matured under the calls aftet that date. In addition to tbe amount subject to payment and cancelation, prior to Nov. 1st., there were slso paid before that day certain bonds amounting to $50, 725.550 which were antictpatedas the maturity of which $2,664,850 had not been called, thus $107,341,800,had been applied prior to the fitst of Nov. 1886, to the extinguishment of our bonded and interest-bearing debt, leaving on tbat day still outstanding the sum ot $1,183, 443,112. Of this account $80,848,700 were still represented by the three per cent bonds. Tbey, however, have been since Nov. 14, or will at once be, further reduced by $22*606, ISO, being bonds which have been called, as already been stated, bnt not redeemed andean* cclled before the latter date. COINAGE. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1S&6, there were coined nnder the compulsory aurtr coinage act of 1878. 29,838,849 bilver douazs, and tbe cost of the silver used in such coinage was $-.23,448,960.00. There bad been coined up to tbe close of tbe previous fiscal year, under tbe provisions of the law, 203,882,554 silver dollars, and on the first day ot December, 1886, tbe total amount of eucb coinage was $247,131,549. The director of the mint re­ ports that at the time of the passage of the law of 1878 directing this coinage, the in­ trinsic value of the dollars thus coined was ninety-four and ona-fourths ceutseach, aDd that on the 81st day of July, 1886, the price of silver reached tbe lowest etege ever known, so that the intrinsic or bullion price of oar standard dollar at that date was less than seventy-two cents. The price of stiver on the 30th day of November last was such as to make the dollars intrinsically worth 78 cents each. These differences in value of tbe coins represent the fluctuations in the price of sil­ ver, and they certainly do not indicate that compulsory coinage by the goverumeht en­ hances the price of that commodity or secures nniformit in its value. Kvery fair and legal effort has been made by the treasury departim nt to diatri bate ibis currency among the people. The with­ drawal of United States treasury notes of bmull denominations and the issuing ot small silver coius have been resorted to in tho en­ deavor to accomplish this icsult, in obedience to tbe will and sentiments of the representa­ tives of ihe people iu congress. On ihe 27th day of November 18S0. the people held or these coins, or ccrtificat.es representing them, lh^ nominal sum of §11.6,^77,0^1, and we still l.uvc ^70.404,345 in the treasury, ad aeainst ae.aut $143,804,055 in the bands of the people and 573,8o5.390 remaining in the treasury one year a^'o. The director of the mint a^i.n urges the necessity of more vault room lor the purpose of storing these silver dollai.-s which are not needed for circu ation by 'h pop'e. 1 have seen no reason to cbauue •. lews expressed in iuy last annual mess 1 i!ui subject of compulsory coinage, i: .i urge ita su» pencioc on all the g- 'taii:ed in my loriner rccomraeudui:.- .-uit«rcea by tho significant increase of our j,'old exportations during tho last year, as appears by the com­ parative statement herewith pretcnti d, and for the further reasons that the u.o this cur­ rency is distributed among tin people, the greater it becomes our 10 pu.n :. it from disaster that we now havu nbuneai io for all onr needs, and that tiuro se- hut little propriety in building vault .- to i-ine inch cur­ rency. wiiun the ouly preten.-e f«.r its coinage is the necessity of its use by the people as a circulating medium. cubToits er.vi i.-t:i: srrrs. The great rcuiii'.et of pending in the United States courts for the i-mituern dis­ tricts of New York, flowing inter the col­ lections of custonss-ievfuue a. th« port ot New Vorl and tho number of su: suits that ate a!most, daily instituted are cirt•»!' worthy the attention of the congress. These legal coiit'ovt-r&ief, bated neon corflictlng views by teis nntt he collector i.s to too interpre­ tation of our pre'.:tit compl'x and Indefinite rtv. nue luws, might be latgely '/.v -'Ud by au amendment of laws. Dut providing such amernime! issue, r, tho present condition of this litigation -houM be relieved, 'lhere are now pe-idin^ about 2,500 of these FU)ts. More than 1,100 Jjliave been commenced within the past eighteen month*, and many of the other.- have been at for more than twen'y live. \ear,. These delay-H subject tho government to tors of evi­ dence ar,d prevent the preparation necesciry I to defeat unjust and fictitious C):imH, while corstan 1 ly accruing in e-c!t threat I ens to double the demand* involved, in the present condiiion, of the dockets of the courts, well filled with private rents and of the force allowed the district attorney, no greater that) in ncc^ary for the ordinary and current btifdi-ees of his offices, thece revenues litiga­ tions cannot tie considered. In default of tbe adoption by tbe congress of a plan for the general reorganization of the federal courts, as bas heretofore, been recommended, 1 urge the propriety of passing a law permitting the ap­ pointment of en additional federal judge in tbo district where th*se government suits have assimilated, so that by continuouts ees fions of the courts devoted to the trial of these cases way be determined. It is entirely plain that a great eaviDg to the government would bo accomplished by such a remedy, and the suit­ ors who have honeat claims would not be de­ nied justice through delay.
