4 CONGRESS CONVENES FOR SECOND SESSION Legislative Program E: pected to Require About Seven Months. Washington, D. C.—The sixty-sev enth congress convened lor its second •«selon Monday. After a ten-day rest following Uie •xtra session, house and senate re turned to face tasks which leaders predict will occupy probably seven months. Nearly u dozen questions of legislative policy confront the mem bers. while scores of lesser matters will be pressed. President Harding delivered bis message Tuesday. It appeared highly probable that no consideration would be given the naval supply bill until some indication Is had of probable results of the arms conference, while that dealing with aimy funds is slated for late study because it may also be affected. Panama canal tolls and funding of the allied debt are two other measures which appear to be linked up with the arms conference insofar as debate is concerned. This congress is the first to deal with the government's expenditures in budget form. The house and Us ap propriations committee will take up the combined supply bill with the ex pectation, it was said, of having all of Its items to the senate by April & inquiries Into the railroad and agri cultural problems have been progres sing several months, but neither can be expected, according to leaders, to take concrete legislative form for sev eral months. Reorganization of governmental bu reaus and functions, Including the ad ministration of Alaska, promised to be a subject at the forefront of congres sional business. The senate, barring changes In Its programme, will turn first to the al lied debt funding bill. Another proposition before the sen ate Is the resolution to declare Tru man H. Newberry, republican, the duly elected senator from Michigan and to deny claims of Henry Ford, democrat, to the seat. 

HARDING REQUESTED TO HEAR FILIPINOS Manila, P. I. — President Harding was asked to take no action on the Wood-Forbes report without first hear ing Philippine representatives In a Joint resolution adopted by the legis lature. The resolution referred to the message of President Wilson to congress December 7, 1920, in which he declared the Philippine« had, by maintaining a stable government, ful filled the condition precedent to inde pendence and recommended that It be granted. It declared acceptance of the Wood-Forbes recommendations "would seriously affect the political future and vital interests of the coun- , try." The resolution was cabled to the Philippine commission at Washington to be transmitted to President Hard ing. The report was defended by Senator JadJl Butum, the only Moro in the ( senate, who represents the islands of : Mindanao and Sulu. Other senators regarded the report as unduly magnifying the defects of the Filipinos. JOB

We all make them. When your telephone bell rings and the operator says, "Will you excuse it please, there is no one on the line now," she is not responsible for your annoyance and inconvenience. The occasion for the use of the phrase most frequently arises when the called party is slow to answer—the calling subscriber does not wait and hangs up his telephone. Many times daily telephone users call wrong numbers—use incorrect prefixes, such as "Main for "Market"—transpose ligures, such as 5342 for 5432. Suddenly realizing their mistakes, they hang up their telephone. Without fault or negligence on her part the telephone operator is left to explain, and the sentence first quoted is that adopted as most briefly and concisely covering the situation. &Î5ÜÎ % f rr»'i The Pacific Telephone And Telegraph Company r UNEMPLOYMENT GROWS. Unemployment is increasing throughout Idaho, save Pocatello according to the monthly digest made by the United States em ployment service, and conditions, now bad, promise to grow worse. Speaking generally of Idaho, the report says lumbering industries are operated on a greatly re stricted liasis with a further re duction considered probable. Mining is much depressed, present operations approximate ing 50 per cent. While the pro duction of precious metals is in creasing slightly, there is little prospect of early employment; agricultural lines are releasing workers at an increasing rate and many are drifting to other sections. There is a sensational reduction in lines requiring com mon labor. "It is anticipated there will lye a considerable increase in unem -1 ployment during the next two months, particularly in the agri cultural and mountain sections," says the report. In Boise unemployment has in creased where building is dull and lumber operations much cur tailed, with little prospect of im provement during the winter. Miscellaneous mercantile busi ness is characterized as fair with a slight downward tendency. At Pocatello, however, the employment trend is upward. The flour mills are reported nor mal; railroad occupations conti nue to gain with encouraging prospects for increased shop and track maintenance work ; miscel laneous business is gradually im proving and building shows in creased activity with the outlook good for fairly steady employ ment during the next 60 days.
