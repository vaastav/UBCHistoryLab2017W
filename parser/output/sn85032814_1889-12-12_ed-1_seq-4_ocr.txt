Labor Commissioner Betton has received a communication from Rob ert P. Porter, superintendent of cen sus, that four supervisors will be ap pointed in Kansas to take the national census of 1890 in this state. For this purpose he announces that he has di vided the state into four districts, and each district will have a supervisor in direct charge.

Public decency and prosperity demand the extermination of the evil, and the newspapers can do much to ward accomplishing this by refusing to mention the concern or cry out against it It will be a little hard on the con gressmen if the Silcott defalcation shall keep them out of a part of their salary for a time. But the people would find some consolation for the hardship if it should induce congress to shorten up the session in order to save members some of their Washing ton expenses. It is more to be feared, however, that the members will pro vide for themselves in the deficiency Will. Kansas City Stir. ' President Harrison certainly did not spend his summer vacation, fishing.

It has the true re publican tariff ring, and the old sold iers will know just where to find their chief executive on pension bills, this time. Each subject of immediate im portance to the country was handled in a fearless, statesmanlike manner. We should like to know why Kan sas is considered "in luck" by the ap pointment of C. S. Martin, of Saliua, as reading clerk of the house and the bright prospeets of several other of our representatives securing import ant offices. There is no luck about it. Ability wins, and congress is not slow in recognizing the competency of the men sent by our great state as her representatives to the national capital to fill any responsible position to which they maj he elected. We again desire the attention of de linquent subscribers, and urge them to call and settle as soon as possible by paying cash, or we will take grain and country produce, allowing the highest market price. This is intend ed more especially for those who are more than one year in arrears.. We do not complain when a subscriber has been carried a 3ear or so, but there are some who have been carried for the past two or three years, and it is but fair that they should at lea t pay something on their sub .cription. Wholesale houses will not carry us, and it takes money to run a newspaper honorably. If the proposed fast mail service for the southwest is inaugurated, it will be a right move in a much needed direction. We are glad that the great Rock Island com pan possesses the true spirit of enterprise by showing a willingness to put on a fast train over two of its western lines from Kansas City to Hutchinson and Wichita. We believe it will be the moans of a great er increase of through travel over its already popular Kansas lines. Let the good work for the betterment of our state go on. But it would please us better to have a fast mail put on between Kansas City and Colin. Kansas Sugar. The sugar industry will be one of the subjects for discussion at the an nual meeting of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture in January. In a general way there is much confi dence felt in the possibilities of sor ghum as a source of wealth to the state, but it is a question whether the experiments in the way of its manu facture into sugar have justified such a feeling. In cases where the indus try has failed to yield profitable re turns, the results have been attribut ed to imperfections in the process em ployed, and to other causes which it is claimed can be remedied. These questions should all be set tled as definitely as possible at the January meeting of the Board of Ag riculture. Many different communi ties in the state are proceeding to vote bonds for the construction of mills, and are preparing to invest large sums of money in plants which will be worthless unless sugar can be produc ed from sorghumat a profit While such undertakings reflect public SDir- it, they should be prosecuted intelli gently, and with'srme degree of eer- uuniy as 10 tue cuaracter ox tne re sults. A witty Kansas man says it is not uncommoa for the people of his state to bond themselves for water .works before Providence has furnished creeks or rivers to supply them. There is a zeal without knowledge in the moral world, and it has its counterpart" m the material world in enterprise with out judgment. It should be the object of the Board of Agriculture at its January meeting to ascertain just what has been ac complished by the sugar mills already constructed in Kansas, and to what extent they have justified the invest ment required to put them in opera tion. It is claimed that some of them have paid, and that others have lost money. There has been so much conflicting testimony in regard to the whole matter that the pubhd has not been able to form any decided opinion on the question' and cannot do' so un til some more authentic information than has" yet been furnished is forth coming. This it will be the duty of the State Board to give to the people, and it is highly impoitint to the state of Kansas that its testimony in relation to the subject should be strict ly in accoi dance with the facts, and so reliable ss to form a basis for future operations. Secretary Mohler has just returned from a tour of inspection among the sugar mills in Western Kansas, and is very favorably impressed with tho new "roasting process" which has been in troduced at Mineola. It is the inven tion of Mr. A. J. Adamson, of Nema ha county, and it is predicted by per sons who have investigated it careful ly that it will entirely revolutionize the sugar business in Ka sas. It is a simple plan by which the cane is carried through a long oven, thereby improving its quality and increasing the percentage of saccharine matter. The observations of Mr.. Mohler will be laid before the board,and the fruits of Mr. Adamson's invention will be subjected to close scrutiny. No ef fort should be spared to obtain the real facts in regard to the sugar in dustry in Kansas,and the Department of Agriculture could not direct its at tention to a more important subject I TrtT ', . , J Never before has Colby been honored ... . r 1 M wiiii auuii h line uisniav 01 uumday i goods as cm be New York Racket cet."

Thoroughly earnest work is being done in behalf of tariff reform ,by ine New York Weekly Post, which holds that the time to discuss this economic ques tion is now, rather than in the beat of a Presidential campaign. Every issue of the paper contains articles bearing upon some phase of the subject, together with question, 03- doubting readers, with ans wers by the editor, all tending to facili tate and simplify the discussion. The Post has been adopted by a number of clubs and other organizations as the best exponent of the subject, and its discus sions are conducted in a spirit of fairness which entitle it to the respect of oppon eats as well as advocates of the revision of a war tariff to adapt it to times of peace. The Post is compiling a directory of active tariff-reform organizations in the United States, and has already pub lished one installment of the list. The Weekly Post is a 12-page paper, and contains all the features requisite for a first class general family journal. Price f 1 per year. In combination with the Cat $1.75 per year.

JKFFURSON DAVIS. 1 -"- - to impress upon him that his health was improv ing. He steadily insisted that there was no improvement, but with Chris tian resignation he was content to ac cept whatever Providence had in store for him. BIOGKAl'HICAL. Jefferson Davis was born June 3, 1808, in that part of Christian County, Ky., which now forms Todd County, and soon after hia birth his father removed to Mississippi and settled near Woodvllle, Wilkinson County. Jefferson Davis received an academical ed ucation, and was sent to Transylvania Col lege, Kentucky, which he left in 1824, having been appointed by President Monroe a cadet in the Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated in 1623. In 1845 ho was elected a Representative to Congress, and took his seat in December of that year. In August, 1847, be was -appointed by the Governor of Mississippi United States Senator to All a vacancy, and at the ensuing session of the State Legislature, January 11, 1848, was unanimously elected to the same office for the residue of the term, which ex pired March 4, 1851. In 1850 he was re-elected for the ensuing full term. In September, 1851, he was nominated for Governor of Mississippi by the Democratic party In opposition to Henry S. Foote, the candidate of the Union party. He resigned his seat in the Senate on accepting the nomination, and whs beaten in the election by a majority of 908 votes. In 185.) he was appointed by President Pierce Secretary of War, which post he held until the inauguration of Prettldent Buchan an in 1857. On his retirement from the War Department he ro-entered the Senate for the term ending March 4, 1863. On February 4, 1861, the Confederate Con gress met at Montgomery, organized a pro visional Government for the seceded States, and on the 9th, by unanimous vote elected Jefferson Davis Presideut of the Confederate States of America.

It is surrounded by portraits of other ex-Secretaries, including Simon Cameron, General Schotield and Messrs. Flo3'd and Con rad. It bears the inscription, "Jeffer son Davis, Secretary of War 1853-57, Pierce's Administration." There was no crape about the portrait and the flag over the building, which had al ways been half-masted on the'death of an ex-Secretary, floated in a good breeze from its usual place at the top of the staff. Secretary Proctor, seen yesterday morning and asked what course the department would pursue in regard to Mr. Davis' death, said: "I see no oc casion for any action whatever. It would serve no good purpose that I can see. It is better to let the matter rest in oblivion, sleep if it will, and to rel egate it to the past, than to do any thing that would revive memories best forgotten." Lying In State. New Orleans, Dec. 8. The re mains of Jefferson Davis are lying in state in the council chamber at the city hall. The coffin rests upon a cata falque and is devoid of much orna mentation. ' The casket has a silver plate, upon which is the simple inscrip tion: "Jefferson Davis, At Rest," with the date of death. Viewed By ThouMiida. Neav Orleans, Dec 9. Many churches held memorial services in honor of Jefferson Davis yesterday, principally the Protestant Episcopal, Catholic, Methodist and Presbyterian. All day long there was a ceaseless stream of people viewing the remains of Jefferson Davis. When the doors opened at ten o'clock fully 3,000 were waitingto enter. The crowd was so great that the people were allowed to pass the bier iu double instead of single column and over 3,300 people passed every hour. The total yesterday was fully 40,000.

An audience ot 5,000 people and an outside asaemblaga of 10,000 enthusiastic spectators last night witnessed the dedication of the largest and grandest operatic structure in the world, the Chicago Auditorium. Five thousand electric lights illumi nated the interior of the colossal tructure to the brightness of noonday; and the 1,000 incandescent border lights of varied colors that hung over the stage, the magnificent proscenium arch and mammoth organ, the grand foyer and carved mahogany pillars, the hand somest gilded rows ol boxes known to modern decorative art, combined with the presence of one of the most dis tinguished and critical audiences in America, rendered the occasion truly one long to be"emembered by the queen of the evening Mme. Adelina Patti, the sovereign of song. A few minutes past eight o'clock the Presidential party entered the boxes reserved for them, and as the vast audi ence fully recognized the chief magis trate of the Nation the momentary ap plause deepened into a long continued ovation. The magnificent 175-stop organ with its 7,000 pipes and bells breathed -forth in accompaniment with the triumphal fantasia composed by Theodore Du Bois for the memorial oc casion. Among the prominent people who oc cupied the boxes were President Har rison, Vice-President Morton, Mrs. Morton, Secretary Ilalford, Ferd W. Peck and Mrs. Peck, Assistant Postmaster-General Clarkson and Mrs. Clarkson, Prof. David Swing. General RA. Alger and Miss Alger, United States Judge Gresham and Mrs. Gresham, Governor Pifer and Mrs. Fifer, General George Crook and Mrs. Crook, Hon. J. S. Runnells and Mrs. Runnells, General II. C. Corbin, Mayor Cregier and Mrs. Cregier, Governor Merriman and Mrs. Merriman, Gov ernor Larrabee and Mrs. Larrabee, Governor Hoard and Governor Gordon, of Georgia. There was another burst of applause as the form of Mayor Cregier was seen advancing to the front of the mammoth stage. In appropriate language Mayor Cregier welcomed the guests of the evening, and to every courteous allu sion to the President, the Governors of the surrounding States and the officers of the Canadian provinces, the audi ence responded with rounds ot ap plause. In concluding, the mayor invited the city's guests to another occasion of even greater importance, which would be an era in Chicago's history three years hence the World's Fair of 1892. After the applause had somewhat subsided, President Harrison advanced slowly to the front and, -bowing with majestic dignity to the great assem blage, spoke as follows: LADnst and Gkxtlemsh: Some of my newspaper friends have been puzzlingthem selves in order to discover the reason why I had left Washington to be present here to night. I do not think I need, in view of the magnificent spectacle presented to ns here to-night, to state the motives which have impellcdmy presence. Surely no loyal citi zens of Chicago, who sit here to-night under this witching and magnificent scene, will ask for any other reason than that which l here presented. Applause. I do most heartily congratulate you upon the completion and Inauguration of this magnificent building without an equal In this country, and, so far as I know, without an equal in the world. Applause. We have here about us to-night In this magnificent architecture, in this tasteful decoration, that which is an education and inspiration. Ap plause. It might well tempt one whose surroundings were much farther removed from this scene than Is the capital city to make a longer Journey than I have done, to stand for an hour in the view of such u spectacle of mag nificence and grandeur and architectural triumph as this great applause, and If that be true, surely there Is reason enough why tho President may turn aside for a little while from public duty to mingle with the citizens in celebrating an event so high and so worthy of commemoration as this triumph to-night. Prolonged applause. Not a speech certainly not the careless words of an extemporaneous speech can, adequately express all the sentiments I feel in contemplating the fitting culmination of this deed. Applause. Only the voice of the immortal singer can bring from these arches those echoes which will tell ns the true secrets and architectural triumphs of their construction. Applause. Tou will permit me to thank you, to thank the mayor, to thank the presi dent of this association and to thank all those good citizens with whom I hvae to-day been brought in personal contact, for that kindness and respect with which you and they have received me; and you will permit me to thank yon, my fellow citizens, ror tne cordiality wnich you have kindly displayed here to-night. It is my wish, and it may be the wish of all, that this great building may continue to be to all of your population that which It should be an ediUce opening its doors from night to night, calling your people here away from the care of business to those en joyments and pursuits and entertainments which develop the sonls of'men. Applause. It Is an hour to inspire those whose minds are heavy with dally toil and in this mag Ificencs an enchanted presence to lift them for a time out of the dull things into those higher things whero men should live. Great applause. A cantata, composed for the occa sion by Frederick G. Gleason, was sung by a chorus of 500 voices, after which Hon. John S. Runnels of Chi cago, delivered ant address compli menting the Auditorium Association upon its triumph and paying frequent tributes to the guest of the evening, the President of the United States. Mme. Patti then sang "Home, Sweet Home," which was received with great applause. 8alcided Beeaese Discarded. Atchison, Kan., Dec 11.
