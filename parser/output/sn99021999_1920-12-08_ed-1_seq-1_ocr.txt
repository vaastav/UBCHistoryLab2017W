I believe this to "toe the faith of America, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in the , days to come, whether in America tor elsewhere."

Insurance Firms Ordered to Stop Selling Stock Alleged Shady Transactions Of Exchanging Mortgaged Property for Stock Probed By State Officials. Lincoln, Dec. 7. (Special.) The Lancaster county district court has issued a restraining order forbidding the Bankers Fire Insurance com pany and the Bankers Automobile Insurance company from continuing to sell stock on application of the Insurance department of the state. It appears, according to Insurance Commissioner W. B. Young, that the Bankers Fire Insurance com pany filed articles of incorporation with the secretary of state on April 21, 1919, and began the selling of stock to the amount of $500,000 par value. In the latter part of the same year the' Insurance department made an investigation and the li cense to sell stock was given. Tho stock was sold through the Bankers Brokerage company, the . brokerage company paying $15 a 6hare and in turn selling it to the public at $25 a share. Transactions Revealed. The license to sell stock was granted on the provision that a por tion of the stock should be cancciea. Among the transoctions was a note for $100,000 in oavnient of stock which was secured by stocf holders' notes. Another transaction 'by the com pany was the sale by A. H. Arm strong, stockholder in the insurance firm, to the Bankers Brokerage com pany of a building at the southwest corner 'of Sixteenth and O streets in Lincoln for $100,000, Mr. Armstrong receiving in payment that amount of stock in the Bankers Fire Insur ance company, which afterwards was sold to the brokerage company for the same amount. Commissioner Young sent ap praisers to appraise the property who turned in a valuation of $64,000 on the building, which already had a mortgage of $30,000 upon it not included in the amount paid for the building, it is alleged. New Investigation Ordered. Still another transaction which the records of the investigation dis close was that Charles Maxion, a stockholder, bought land in Colo rado for $20 an acre and mortgaged it to the insurance .company at the rate of $75 an acre. The statutes strictly prohibit this sort of a deal by stockholders of a company. Examiners of the company threw out approximately $300,000 in valu ation, leaving a surplus June 30 last of about $106,000. Since that date the examination shows further deal ings in Colorado land and the ex aminers have been ordered to make a new investigation. The Bankers Automobile Insur ance company, which is included in the court proceedings, is practically owned by the same , men. Some peculiar transactions have been made, according to Mr. Young, and the department has decided that a further examination should be made and the present officers and direc tors removed. He also thinks that reorganization of the companies m'ght save them. Argentina Delegation to Geneva to Sail Wednesday Geneva, Dec. 7. (By The Asso ciated Press.)

AH of those with whom the president-elect conferred preserved si- lence regarding the details of the dis cussions and Mr. Harding himself ; said the conversations were strictly of a confidential nature.. He re peated his statement of yesterday that he was seeking by direct person al consultation to frame an adminis trative policy behind which everyone could stand. In his search for information and advice about the league, the president-elect summoned republican sen ators of the irreconcilable and of the mild reservation groups alike and it is understood he told them he want ed suggestions from every quarter. Without submitting anv concrete plan of his own, he is said to have asked plainly what sort of interna tional agreemwit each of his con ferees would support. ' The discussion of cabinet selec tions fjad a wider scope, several of his rtost trusted friends undertak ing to canvass the situation in sep arate conferences at various places throughout the capitol. Harry M.

Congression al and consideration .of methods to aid in restoring normal conditions in business appeared in the offing to night with the announcement that majority members of the ways and means committee would meet tomor row to discuss a legislative program with respect" to commerce and in dustry. The enormous number of bills dealing with farming and industry presented yesterday and today, to gether with an apparent desire of leaders to do something for busi ness generally, made it appear cer tain that congressional attention would be turned to business prob lems, once the appropriation bills are out of the way. Leaders in the sen ate and house do not believe that actual enactment of any" such legis liaton can be accomplished during the present brief session, but they are evidently agreed that the founda tions should be laid through com mittee consideration for prompt ac tion after March 4, next. Many Bills. The ways and means committee will have before it. a wide range of proposals, for bills already dropped in the senate and house hoppers in clude measures providing all the way from far reaching tax and tariff re forms and agricultural relief to aid or protection td limited groups of industries.. Some of the measures submitted would direct congressional investiga tion of unemployment.

The program of Senator Capper, repub lican, Kansas, for farm relief legis lation found expression in several measures to regulate grain ex changes, while Senator McCumber, republican. North Dakota, intro duced bills to prohibit the importa- tjon for one year of grain and grain products and live stock and other food commodities, and the appoint ment by the president of a commis sion to prepare for congress a gen eral system of co-operative market ing. Farm Bills Offered. Co-operative marketing also wai dealt with in the house bills. Means of taking care of the surplus of ce real crops and at the same time as suring the farmer of proper sale of his products was the stated object of a bill by Representative Christo pherson, republican, South Dakota, who proposed to revive the United States Grain corporation as the ma chinery to handle the farm surplus. All of the measures dealing with relief for farmers were designed, their proponents declared, to aid the consumer as well as the producer, but the urban members were not overlooking opportunities to render assistance by legislation where pos sible to the businesses of finance and manufacturing through changes in the federal reserve act and banking laws.
