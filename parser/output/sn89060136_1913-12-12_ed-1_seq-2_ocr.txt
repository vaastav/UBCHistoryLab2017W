It was the first time the President bad been brought face to face with the issue in a formal way. He told his callers that, whatever might be hi* views on woman suffrage or any other subject, he had made it a rule not to urge anything upon Con gress that had not been the subject of "organic consideration” by the Demo cratic party, of which he considered himself the spokesman. ’ The President said that when mem bers of Congress consulted .hlni he would freely give his views, and he added that having already been asked his opinion about the organization of a standing committee in the House of Representatives to consider woman suffrage, he had expressed himself in favor of such a committee.

I set myself this very strict rule when I was Governor of ’ New Jersey, and have followed it as President, and shall follow it as President—that I am not at liberty to urge upon Congress in messages policies which have not had the organic considera tion of those for whom I am spokesman.

I con ceive that to be part of the whole process of government, that I shall be spokesman for ' . somebody, hot for myself. 1 am by my own principles shut out, in the language of thd street, from “starting anything.” One member of die Rules Com mute did come to ine and ask me what I thought about this suggestion of yours of appoint ing a special committee of the House, as the Senate has already appointed a special committee for the consideration of woman suf frage, and I told him that I thought it was the proper thing to do.

Secretary Wants Authority To Study Domestic Conditions—Fed eral Aid For Roads Urged. Washington.—Reorganization of the Department of Agriculture is fore shadowed in Secretary Houston’s first annual report presented to President Wilson.

Free distribution of seeds by Con gressmen should be discontinued, the Secretary recommends. He would Conduct in its stead a constructive work in securing and distributing new seeds and plants. Financial Help For Farmers. Conditions vary widely in the United States, says the report, because farm ers do not equally need better credit arrangements, and aH sections are not similarly circumstanced. It contends that when all necqssary allowance has been made for fundamental factors it Is probably clear that the rural'com munities are not as effi'ciently served as they should be by existing financial arrangements. The Secretary believes there does not appear to be need for unique or special legislation or for legislation which shall aim to give the farmer credit on easier terms than other members of society. Wbat is needed is the creation of conditions and machinery which shall enable him on similar credit foundations to secure money at the same rates as those that prevail for other classes and for other sections. “Good roads are... prerequisite for better marketing, for better schools and for more comfortable rural- liv ing," says the Secretary. “Better sanitation and hygiene in the home, in the school and in the community are just as vital for the rural community as for the urban," says the report Would Help the Housewife. To gain information to enable the department better to serve rural wom en the Secretary has addressed letters of Inquiry to the women of 55,000 selected farms covering every county. Analysis of the letters shows that farm women desire assistance as to ways of securing running ‘water, introduc ing household power machinery and labor-saving arrangements and provid ing better hygienic and sanitary con ditions. Many seek advice as to the better marketing of the articles they produce.

Washington. The channels of diplomatic 'correspondence between Japan and the United States over the California Alien Land law have been exhausted, without results, and any action looking to an adjustment of the tangle must come from a new move by one power or the other.

It is understood that Japan through out maintained that its treaty rights were invaded by the law, while the United States has persistently asserted the contrary. Jap Competition Too Much. For years the Japanese population in California has been increasing, and Japanese immigrant laborers have be come landowners and farmers. , The remarkable advance of the Japanese from peon to producer is re sponsible for the strenuous efforts of the Californians to get rid of them. TIE? Japanese have displaced the whites first from the jobs and then from the land. The white farnmrs cannot compete with the Japanese; they are being driven out of their homes by the Japanese; the Japanese are acquiring some of the best farm ing lands of the State, and already they are said-to control 90 per cent of its agriculture.

CHANGE IN EFFECT JANUARY 1 i Fifty-Pound Limit Fixed For First and Second Zones Twenty in All Others Books * Admitted. Washington.—Postmaster General Burleson’s proposal to increase the weight limits of parcel post packages in the first and second zones from 20 to 50 pounds, to admit books to the parcel post and to reduce rates in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth zones was approved by the Igter-State Commerce Commission. The maximum weight of parcels to all zones beyond the second was in creased from 11 to 20 pounds. One of the reasons in raising the weight limit in the local zones is to encourage the utilization of the parcel post as a phipping agency for farm produce to the cities. After January 1 a farmer living at any point in Maryland, as far south in Virginia as Newport News, Petersburg or Lexing ton, Va., in one-half of Pennsylvania, two-thirds of New. Jersey and all Dela ware, can ship to Baltimore a “mar ket basket" weighing 50 pounds for 54 cents. , The commission’s “consent” to the proposed changes was transmitted in i three letters from Chairman Clark to Postmaster General Burleson. The approved changes lir rates and weights, to be in effect January 1, 1914, follow: - Cost Of Service Reduced. To reduce the rates for the third zone from seven cents for the first pound and five cents for each addi tional pound to six* cents for the first pound and two cents for each addi tional pound. To reduce the rates for the fourth zone from eight cents' for the first pound and six cents for each addition al pound to seven cents for the first pound and four cents for each addi tional pound. To reduce the rates for the fifth zone from nine cents for the first pound and seven cents for each additional pound to eight cents for the first pound and six cents for each addi tional pound. To reduce the rates for the sixth zone from ten'cents for the first pound and nine cents for each additional pound to nine cents for the first pound and eight cents for each addi tional pound. -■ > l Revenue Will Cover Cost. “It seems obvious," says the com mission, “that the service to the pub lic will be promoted by these changes, provided the revenue from the serv ice is not less than the cost thereof. Tour experience and i iatistics seem to show clearly that the revenue will not be less than the cost of the serv ice." Serious objections'to the proposed change in the rates on books and catalogues were made chiefly by mail ers of heavy catalogues, but the com mission says it feels that the changes are in the interest of the public gener ally. 1 SHE WAB FIRST WOMAN LAWYER.

I West coast of Ireland by one of the! Fleetwood trawlers when trawling for; hake, who brought It to their home port, and it was afterwards sent, as A shop attraction, to Preston, where the writer had the opportunity of examin-' ' ing it. The fish in question weighed l 715 pounds and measured six feet six! inches in length, and is the largest ofj The Tunny Fish. its species ever brought to Fleetwoodl The tunny-belongs to the mackerel family, having somewhat the appear ance of a gigantic and is a rare visitor to British waters. It is a southern fish, particularly abundant in the Mediterranean, where the fisheries are of great antiquity, and is today much in demand for itß edible qualities in the countries bordering on that sea. The Phoenicians established extensive fisheries for tunny, and as an indica tion of their value the tunny appears en the medals of Cadiz and Carteia. Unfortunately, the specimen here shown is wrinkled in the lower portion of the body, owing to its not being hoisted clear of the ground when being photographed, and the fish is leaning on its tail, consequently wrinkling it. A x tunny weighing three and a half hun dredweight and about eight feet long, and another specimen of the same . -species said to be “just under 12 feet in length,” and weighing six and a half hundredweight, were caught in the North sea and landed at East Coast fishing ports during the month of Sep tember this year. The Mediterranean tunny is allied to the tuna of the Cali fornian coast, and both these fish may be obtained in this country preserved in tins.
