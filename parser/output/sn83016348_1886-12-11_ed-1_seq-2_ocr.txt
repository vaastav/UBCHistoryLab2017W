Ingersou., it is said, is willing to bet one thousand dollars against one hundred that Cleveland will not be re-elected President. The New York Anti Saloon Repub licans recently held a convention and adopted High License as one of the temperance measures they would sus l,m This proves pretty conclusively that their movement don’t mean any thing. Tin will of ex-President Arthur has been admitted to probate in New York, His estate, real and personal, is estimated to be worth about $2 50, 000, and, with the exception of several small charitable bequests, goes entirely to his two children. When Mr. Win. English, the opulent but frugal banker of Indiana, was a audidate for Vice-PresicCnt on the Pilden ticket he gave 

SIOO to the cam paign fund. Now he is a candidate for the United States Senate, and it is expected that he will give at least 85. I'here will be twenty Slates having Republican delegations in the next house —that is a majority of the mem bers in each of twenty States will be Republican. This ensures the election of a Republican President if the elec tion should be thrown into the House. 11 is one ol the good signs of the times that the common sense of the public tends more and more to lake munici pal elections out of politics. The in stinct of the community turns to some citizen well known and highly respected not as a party politician, but as an up right, intelligent, energetic man, who will be superior to jobs and political and personal intrigues and conduct the business of the city, county or town upon sound business principles.— fix. Ben. Perlev Poore recalls a par allel to the Blaine-Edmunds episode. Frank Pierce, when President, was so provoked one day by allusions t him in a speech made in the Senate by lohn P. Hale, of New Hampshire, that when the Senator and his wife pre sented themselves at a reception that night at the While House, President Pierce cordially shook hands with Mrs. Hale, but took no notice of the Sena tor’s outstretched hand, and, turning squarely on his heel, gave the cut direct. Hon. Wm. E. Chandler has written a truer denying that there existed a feeling of bitterness between ex-Presi dent Arthur and Hon. James G. Blane. He says Mr. Blane manifested no de sire whatever to remain in President Arthur’s cabinet, but, on me contrary, considered a change natural and inev itable. The President, furthermore, urged him to accept the appointment ot Minister to England, which Mr. Blaine declined with thanks, and they parted in a friendly spirit. Mr. Chand ler remembers that \Jr. Blame said to him he did not feel able to keep up ucn an establishment in London as he v.ould desire to maintain. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union of St. Louis has adopted the following : ‘ Whereas, the newspapers r port that Mrs. Whitney, wife of the Secretary ot the N'avv, not long since gave a dinner, a: which were pres nt eighteen ladies, including President Cleveland’s young wife, but no gentle men ; and, whereas, the papers report mat courses of different alcoholic drinks were served ; therefore, be it resolved, that the W. C. T. U.. of Missouri, ex press their deep mortification and re gret that ladies in this high social posi tion should themselves set this bad ex ample to the people of this already diink-diseased country ; and, be it fur ther resolved, that me Secretary of this Convention transmit a copy of this res lution to Mrs. Cleveland.’’ 1 ,ast week we commented upon the absurdities and inconsistencies of the petty system of competitive bids adop ted by the Government, and showed in the case of the mad route between Elk ton and Appleton, the starvation rates paid by the Postoffice Department lor that service. Mr. John Seth has since informed us that the Department is now allowing him Szoo for carrying this mail until the 29th of June next, an advance of 527 over me amount stated by us as received by him. Another in stance illustrative of the beauties of this competitive system comes from Wash ington this week. An engineer officer p id a fire tug J4S for saving the gov ernment wharf at Detroit from destruc tion. Had it not been for the services of the tug a heavy loss would, doubt less, have fallen upon the government, and yet the amount has been disallow ed because competitive bids had not been advertised for ! Commenting on this system the Baltimore American truthfully remarks that “the thing is so outrageously ridiculous as to be almost incredible, and yet it is solemnly and sadly Hue.” Premium Ui kvfi.anu treated Con gress a.id the country at large to a sec ond annual message on Monday. It cannot be considered in any sense a remarkable document, unless its vague and indefinite declarations on the tariff question entrle it to that distinction. As well as Mr. Cleveland’s opinions can be ascertained in his message, he is a self-confessed free-trader. And yet his utterances are not acceptable to prominent free trade journals, the Phil adelphia Record thinking that it is neither dignified or politic to lug into it (his message) “a labored indefimts ness in regard to the tariff.” <)n Civil Service Reform the President is too aggressive by half to suit the Demo cratic leaders. Taken as a whole it may be justly said of the message that “it leaves the impression that there are a great many tangled threads in public affairs and that Mr. Cleveland is unable to unravel them. 

UAMIKK SKiNAla* 4 NOTICEABLE APPEAL. The most uncompromising Republi can paper in Maryland,could not slate more effectively the exact political con dition in th's state, under its present personal mismanagement, than the fol lowin summarized statement of public grievances made by a prominent Dem ocrat of Baltimore and reported in the Sun of that city, presents them. As our leaders are aware, a conference ot Maryland 1 femocrats of prominence has been called to meet in Baltimore on the Bth of January next. That day, which is the anniversary of the victory of Andrew Jackson at New Orleans, has been selected for the conference, to emphasize the necessity of restoring the Maryland Democracy to something like the pristine purity tnat is supposed to have distinguished it, in the days of “'Old Hickory,” when the Dem ocrats who ruled Maryland were men of brains, and re flected honor upon their state by exhi bitions of statesmanship at Washington when sent there as its Representatives. Now-a-days, brains if accompanied by personal honesty are a positive objec tion to a Maryland Congressman. Such men cannot be used and controlled by the State managers, who manipulate the machine through such individual agencies as are acceptable to them. Men of brains and independence of character are troublesome fellows to the “bosses,” simply for the reason, that if such men come to the front they jeopardize the ascendency of the man agers themselves. They are too shrewd and cunning to take up such men. Where need we look for better evidence of this fact than the recent defeat at the hands of his own party of Mr. John V. L, Findlay? He and Mr. Louis E. McComas undoubtedly are two of the ablest and most useful Representatives Maryland has had in recent years in the Lower House of Congress. Mr. McComas’ claims for a re-election to a third term were recognized by his party, and he was triumphantly returned to Congress by the people of his district, his unsuccessful opponent being an in fluential representative of the “Ring’’ of Maryland Bosses. Mr. Findlay on the other hand was ignomoniously beaten by his party, simply because he was unacceptable personally to the managers, not one of whom is compar able to him as a man. His defeat only affords fresh evidence of the potency of the managers in Maryland to put down, and keep down any man or any set of men in their party who are not willing to become subservcnl to their uses and participants in their political methods. What the character of these methods is, every voter in Maryland knows. The political control oj the State is maintained by the fraudulent rote of Baltimore City, and the most unblush ing rascality is resorted to perpetrate the power of the “Machine.” As indicative of the drift of the best sentiment of the Democratic party in the state, the following manifesto is therefore particularly noticeable. A gentleman says The Sun engaged in calling the proposed conference of Maryland Democrats has furnished the following authorized statement for pub lication ; “A number of Democrats, representing the best thought and high est aspirations of the 1 lemocralic party to which they have been attached all their lives, and which has honored them with the highest trusts in the party, and the State and federal government, have been corresponding concerning the present condition of the party, which excites their gravest apprehensions. They consider that the reiterated charges of fraud in the elections in Bal timote city, together with the character ot the officials appointed to conduct elections, have made such a lodgement in the public mind that they are gener- . ally accepted as true, and they are sat isfied that the counties will not long submit to be governed by the fraudu lent vote ot Baltimore city. The ap proach of the constitutional convention which will be held in 1888, and me character and composition of which will be determined by the General As sembly and Governor to be elected in i ,s 8 7, is considered pressing cause for some action which will secure to the people a free vole aud a fair election in selecting members of tne convention and in adopting or rejecting its work i wnen submitted to mein. They are i impressed with the necessity of preserv- i mg the State judiciary intact from cor- 1 rupt influences, which in their opinion 1 can only be done by restoring and se- \ curing fair elections to the people. They are satisfied also that the finances of the State are managed without wis dom or prudence ; that taxes levied on ' the people to be saved in the sinking ; fund to pay debts at maturity have been , illegally squandered, and that loans i which ought to have been paid when i due have been unwis ly and impru dently renewed, and thus taxes con tinued which ought to have been abol- ished. They are also ol opinion that the taxes of the people are consumed ' in useless offices and wasteful expendi ture ; that tne party management has i been usurped by those who use it to j buy and sell legislation, and who dis- , tribute the honors of the party and the offices of the people tor their own ag- j grandizement. Being impressed with this view ot the situation, a number of i gentlemen have bee corresjxmding for some tune past, looking to a conference \ , as to what is necessary to be done to | ■ relieve the party from its present mis i 1 management and to place it on the | 1 solid ground of principle, and thus re gain the confidence of the people, now sorely strained. They are looking to | THE 

CECIL WHIG, ELKTON SATURDAY, DECEMBER, 11, IBS3. an organization ot the ‘State 1 lemocracy’ and an appeal to the Democratic party to make an effort to correct the evils complained ot. In the line ol this ap peal to the party they hope to induce able and expel fenced leaders of the Democratic party to become candidates for the General Assembly in their re spective counties before the party in such counties. Tney hope to reorgan ize the ‘Stale Democracy, in the city of Baltimore with such material as wiP at once command the confidence, re spect and support of the great body of the party in the city and State. By appealing to the party in the counties to relieve Itself from notorious and ad mitted evils and mismanagement, they hope to restore the 1 Vinocratic party to its old hold on the affection and to purge it of ’.lie abuses which now so seriously impair its strength and usc rulness and jeopardize its life in this Stale. They believe that when this appeal is made by an open canvass of the State on the stump and in the press it will be responded to by the 1 lemo cracy of the Slate, who will smk all personal antagonisms and will reorgan ize the Stale Democracy on the firm basis of 1 lemocratie principle and pub lie confidence. The gentlemen con ducting this movement insist that there is no personal object in it ; that no personal aspiration or selfish motive has any influence or gives any direction to it. Candidates to represent it must he selected by public opinion at most fit in their lives and character to be the proper exponents of the principles announced and the issues made by the movement.” Kx-I'ut master \ Tne case of I.

Washington, Dec. U —The Forty ninth Congress begin tbo labors of its last session without an incident of any usual interest or au event of a dramatic nature occurring. Several bills and res olutions were introduced in ihe Senate, toil none ol public importance. After having the message read each bouse ad journed. Ail the Maiyl nd membeis were at then p sis. Mi.

B it, in the Sen ate as well as the House, when a inembei dies theie is a pusa to gel liisseat, units?- it be in the back row. At the beginning ol eacn Congress se .is are chosen ny lo in the House, but there is no such distri butiou iu the senate. A new Senator in variably finds himself located in the work' seat of the last mw. but if lie pussesM b any of the national “get up” he so. n be gins to study the sickly-iuokmg Smalms tor the put pose of estimating which on* owning a good seal is most likely to dn soonest, and it is a common occunenc* for a claim to the seat, to be entered belore the breath is out of the lailiup Senator s body. Senator Wilson anived in the city this morning and was in Ins s*at when the gavel fell to call the Senate to order. IB has been in bad health all the fall, hr says, but lelt somewhat better to-day. Senator G<uman also was promptly oi baud, looking cheerful and confident. Some of his friends who were not wanted by tne public printer called on the Sena tor to see about their reinstatement. When Mr. Cox, of New York, look lhr oath of office he found himself in the eni barrassing position ot having to occupy a seat on me outer row upon the Repub lican side. But from ibis embarrassment be was relieved by the courtesy of Krp leseutalive -I. D. Sayers, of Tex,is, who. upon being introduced lo Mr. Cox. con gratulated him. Ins party and thee lUtilry upoll ms return lo legislative labor. Mi. Savers then in a spirit of courtesy ten dered his seat to Mr. Cox. This seat is a prominent one ol the Democratic side, and was occupied by Mr. Cox during sev ’ eral Congresses. Mr. Cox, though loth ■ to dislodge Mr. Sayers, was finally iu • duced to accept the courtesy, and taking from his scarf a pearl pin of the oesigi. of a star and crescent presented it to Mr. ’ Sayer* as a memento of the occasion. 1 In the House the reeling of the mes sage was a farce. The buzz of convei sa , lion among members on me floor com plete! v drowned the readingclei k's voice. Mr. Findlay, who had manag'd by ink ing a position near tlie desk to catcb i some portions of tlie message, did not seem, when spoken tnalterwaid, to have a veiy high opinion of the document. iB thought the President had stirddled the (.and question —that one porlim of hir niterances on that subject was written to please Morrison and another portion to please Kandall. However, the land' re formeri, whether they are sincere or not declare that they are pleased with the President’s altitude on this momentous question. The President’s reiteration of his fond -1 ness lor civil service ref. rn is disappoint ing to the Democrats, Kandali reads that portion ol the message to mean that the President w.ll stiuply observe and on force the civil seivice law without unde r taking to extend ihe system. It may be that Mr. Kandali is enabled to put tins interpretation upon me civil service chap ter from something that the Presioeni has whispeied into his ear ol his real 1 plans anil purposes; but. Democrats who do not enjoy tlie President's confidence, and who read the messigu without any other light than tlie interpretation of language. Cons rue it. to me.oi that he intends to adhere to his notions of re form. While it is yet too early to form an es timate ot the general opinion of t he mes sag-, it is apparent that its first re. ding has been disappointing *o ihe President’s own party. As a mle, the Democrats want as lit!e civil service reform as p s sible for Hie rein under of this adminis tration. They had hop**d that Cleveland would leave tlie gap open lor a quiet, re treat ou the civil service question. Tney are desirous of ptvmg the way to mic cess in 1888 by a partisan use of pvion age. M..ny hints have fallen from Don ocrat.ic sources of late lo the effect, that the President was convinced that Demo crats must have the olliccs as an incen tive to active party work, ami possibly Mr. Kandali knows tha: the reform doc trine of the -message is submitted as a very good theory, while the practice ol the administration will take another course. THE I’ROl 

EHDINGS. Tue galleries of the Senate chamber were, iu spite of the inclemency of the weather, filled with spectators when, at 12 o'clock noon, the second session of the Forty ninth Congress was opened. In his prayer the ch ipl tin, Rev. J. (. Bn ler, feelingly alluded to the mourning draperies with which the chamber was bung -in memory of the late Senator Pike, ol New Hampshire. Tne presiding odicer, Mr. Sherman, laid before the Senate several ol the an nutl reports of the heads of departments which were ordered printed. Resolutions were adopted fixing the daily hour of meeting at noon; informing the House that the Senate was ready to proceed to business, and for the appoint ment of a committee to wait ou the Pres ide!!*- for the like purpose. Messrs. Ed munds ai.d Saulsbuiy were appointed such committer. The credentials of Senator Williams, of California were presented and the oath of office was administered to him. Among the hills introduced and re ferred were the following; By Mr- Voor hees —to amend the charter of the Wash ington and Georgetown Kadroad Corn pany. By Mr. S.mlsbury—To amend the ' charter of the Capitol, North (> and South Washit gGn Railroad Company. By Mr. Evans —To authorize the con struction of a biidge across the East river. New Yoi k Mr. Mitchell offered a 1 ug preamble and resolutions calling for a report from the Secretary of War as to the reasons for the change of engineer in char ge ol works of internal improvement in < bvgou. At 2 l*. M., after a recess, Senator Ed murids repotted that, the joint committee of the two houses had waited ou the President, and that the President had asked the committee to congratulate the S“tiate aud House on their safe return to tlie Capitol, and to say that he would communicate with Mem in wiiting im mediately. Thereupon the message was { received ami read. The reading was i concluded at 15.25, wh*n M e message and accompany mg documents were oi dared ! printed. Mr. Hoar reminded the Senate that the I Pacific K lilroad funding bill had been i set. down as s special order tor tomorrow, and said he would then ask that its con sideration be deferred, in the hope that the H"ii-e would iu the meantime take ; some action t* at would relieve the Senate of trouble in regard to it. M>. B1 iir announced the death of his late coMeigua, Mr. Pike, and moved, as a mark of resp*ct to his memory, that ' the Senate ad j.turn. He would, at an appropriate time, ask the Senate to set apart a day lor the hearing of eulogies. Tue motion was agreed to, and the Sen ate at 3 30 adjoin tied.
