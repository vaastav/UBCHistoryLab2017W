EDITORIAL COMMENT THE MESSAGE. The president's message is indicative of the vigor and virility of the man who wrote it. He makes no apology for his conduct In regard to the trusts, but ou the contrary, in his opening paragraph sets forth the mosf cogent reasons why the prosecution should be continued. There may be honest differences of opinion, he says, as to many governmental policies; but surely there can be no difference as to the need of unflinch ing perseverance iu the war against successful dishonesty. 1H ho n mended, according to Koosevelt, so us to forbid the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to give supervisory power to the government over those big concerns engaged in interstate business, and in this re gard a beginning has been made by the establishment of the bureau of commerce. - He is still after the big corporations, and advocates national con trol over the railways, for one good reason which is given, the tedious circumlocution of the courts. He is a believer in the doctrine that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Instead of going into court to determine whether a corporation is acting in violation of the law, he wants an exercise of federal control over these bodies, so that it may be determined in advance whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association of combination within the restrictions of the federal law. Roosevelt is in favor of an elastic currency, provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. He quotes from his message a year ago on this head, and shows that he is a better man of finance than the moneyed interests would have us be lieve. For he foresaw a similar condition that we are now laboring un der, and held out the remedy, or at least a sound remedy for the disease. There is one thing in the message in which we fail to agree with Mr. Roosevelt. This is in regard to a mining bureau. We do not want a bureau for this industry, which is one of the most important in the United States. There should be a department of mining with its secretary one of the members of the cabinet. Roosevelt would put us under the secre - tary of the interior, who would be a good farmer and a poor miner. This would not be justice to the mining industry. The secretary of the Interior would doubtless frame laws about which he would know little and the public less. What we want is men who will make studies of conditions, report on new discoveries, keep in touch with all the new methods of mining, the new machinery, and give the public the ad vantage of the government's mining experts in all things pertaining to mines. ' LET US 

MAKE A TRY FOR SILVER. There have been many failures iu Germany of late, and there is fear dint the trouble will spread. The falling off iu the money received from American tourists this year has been Immense. There have been the usual number of tourists but they have got along without so much money. The scarcity of money is so great that many are urging that the war chest of the empire (which is kept in the Julius tower at Span dim, and which contains $30,000,000 in gold) be distributed in the gen eral circulation. While finances are still ou an even keel in England, the wisest financiers there are worried at so much gold being shipped away, and a learned English thinker writes us that a movement in earnest in America to rehabilitate silver in his opinion might lead to the reopening of the Indian mints. This certainly is the time for the friends of silver to combine and make a united demand. The east lias had some experience of late, and Is much more willing to consider any proposition which promises a means of relief than it was a year ago, because its idol gold has fallen. All that was so confidently predicted of it a few years ago has fallen to the ground. It is not either infallible or divine. Think of it. It takes 30 per cent more of it to buy a field of potatoes or the field in which the potatoes grow than it did ten years ago. That is more than silver was beaten down in ten years when the great nations combined to crush it. And gold has had nil the strength that full recognition by all the great nations could give it. Moreover, it was always a coward, and rushed to coyer at .the first note of alarm. . It was never half as stable as silver-, when each had the same recognition. We believe that with the west and south combined making. a united demand for the restoration of silver on a fair ratio with gold, say at one dollar per ounce, it would carry. The old arguments against it would fall flat. The fear" of it in awf-ul quantities would have no standing now, for just now the people of this country are not In a condition to be frightened at a, prospect of more money, and the quality of it would cer tainly be as good as what they are now getting. But it should be pressed with all speed and energy. If the president could "be induced to sound the leading foreign nations through .our embassadors; that would immensely ' help, for the replies would be, four out of five, favorable. Right now in England there is a movement to getthe government to buy immense quantities of silver tor coinage, so that the half sovereigns may be with drawn and sllvev made to do the work done by the half sovereigns 'a the dally transactions of the people, that the gold coins may nd their was back to the banks. Now is the opportune time, sure, gram. " 

EXCERPTS FROM TIIEJESb'AGE Ituntlnurt train rsc l.J t Th national povrraraeut should tke itH-rvtlon over railroad artl- drnta, wiinrvhat along the; lino of federal InaptTtlnn of steamboat. II urge ronnr-M to enact legislation providing limited compensation for accidents to all workmen within the cope of the federal power. He fav ors the general Introduction of the eight-hour day which should be the goal toward which we should stead ily tend, and the government should set the example Id this respect. He renews his previous recom mendation that congress favorably consider the matter of creating the machinery for compulsory investiga tion of such industrial controversies as are of sufficient magnitude and of sufficient concern to the people of the country as a whole to warrant the federal government in taking action. On the Biibject of mineral lands, the president says: In the eastern United States, the mineral fuels have already passed into the hands of large private own ers, and those of the west are rapidly following. It Is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and not wasted, and it would be well to pro tect the people against unjust and extortionate prices, so far as that still can be done. What has been ac complished in the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by the action of the administration, offers a striking example of the good results of such a policy. In my judgment the gov ernment should have the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil, and gas fields in its own possession and to lease the rights to develop them un der proper regulations; or else, If congress will not adopt this method. the coal deposits should be sold un der limitations, to conserve them as public utilities, the right to mine coal being separate from the title to the soil. The regulations should permit coal lands to be worked in sufficient quantity by the several corporations. The present limitations have been ab surd, excessive, and serve no useful purpose, and often render it neces sary that there should be either fraud or else abandonment of the work of getting out the coal. He recommends to the favorable consideration of congress a postal savings system, as recommended by the postmaster general He says that a bureau of minus should be created under the control nd direction of the secretary of the interior; the bureau to have power to collect statistics and make investi gations in all matters pertaining to mining and particularly to the acci dents and dangers of the industry. If this can not now be done, at least dditional appropriations should be given the interior department to be used for the study of mining condi- ions, for the prevention of fraudu lent mining schemes, for carrying ou the work of mapping the mining dis tricts, for studying methods for mini mizing the accidents and dangers in the industry; in short, to aid in all proper ways the development of the mining industry.

Notices are posted up -in the new camp of Stlmler stating that the scale of wages for all underground work shall be (5 per shift, and unskilled labor $4.50 per shift. We cannot look upon tV's as other than an ill advised move at the present time. Many men are out of employment In other camps on account of the string ency of the money market at this time, and the wage schedule adopted in the district, of which that was formerly a part, was $4.50 and $4.00, and from what we know of the tern per of those who are endeavoring to develop the new camp, we believe that this action of the new union, which w.as recently organized, will result in a great measure In delaying the opening. of the camp, If it does not close it down altogether. Were the camp on a producing basts and the cost of other things" necessary for profitable operation less, we believe that there would be no objection on the part of any one to paying the rate demanded, but jiist now is .ft poor time, it appears to us, to ask for kn Increase which conditions do not Justify. The action of the Butte Miners' union in handling the situation which confronted them might well be emu lated by the 'local unions, and would result In a better feeling all around, and certainly would be to thead vantage of all parties concerned.
