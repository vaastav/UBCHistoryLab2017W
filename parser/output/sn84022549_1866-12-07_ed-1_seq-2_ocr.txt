An act to amend section seventeen of chap ter eigniy-seven oi me General Stat utes, entitled 'Of Insurance Companies,' It it hereby enacted, ifc. The Laws. We surrender our space almost entirely this week to the laws pass ed at the late session of tha legislature, and designated by the Secretary of State for publication in the newspapers. We have preferred to put them all in one number, where they will thereby be much more convenient and accessible to all who cure anything about them. Among the acts in which a general interest will be felt, are tho following : Normal Schools- Division of School money Registry of Voters Redemption of Bank bills In terest Preservation of fish increasing pay of jurors and witness and allowing re spondents to testify. The President's Message. We of course have no room this week for the President's Message which was sent to Congress on Monday. It is quite as brief as could be expected of such a document, and is most remarkable for what it docs not say. The President is very much less beligerent in tone toward Congress than in any of his speeches dur ing the last ten months, while he at the same time re-affirms his policy and thinks the best recommendation lie can make to Congress is to immediately admit the southern delegates to Congress. It could hardly be expected that the President would change his mind, and yet it is a strange recommendation to make now that the people have just pronounced an over whelming verdict against it, and especial ly so to urge Congress to do that which their constituents at home have just in structed them not to do. And this is the essence of all there is in the message on national politics. There is no allusion whatever to the pending amendment pro posed by Congress, in other words the pol icy of Congress, nor to the late elections, and the amount of space devoted to this subject is less thun two columns. As a whole the message maybe regarded as conciliatory in tone, and the other sub jects treated of will give general sati-fac- tion to the country. Our relations with France, England and Mexico, are not so complicated as have been represented. appears that the French Emperor did au thorize a variation frcm the agreement in regard to the withdrawal of our troops from Mexico, upon which our government took occasion lo express its dissent. There the matter stands at present, but the Pres ident expresses a hope that France will conform as nearly as possible to the origi nal agreement. On the subject of the Alabama claims, tbe President says there is reason to believe that the new English Ministry will act in a becoming and friend ly spirit. With regaid to the Fenian prisoners in Canada, tho President urges those considerations which tend to clem ency, and says that those prisoners who are citizens of this country have been provided with counsel by our government. During the last fourteen months the public-debt has been reduced $206,879,565, a very gratifying exhibit. The President also expresses the welcome opinion that the taxes may be reduced and the entire debt extinguished in the next quarter of a century. He also recommends that the District of Columbia be allowed a dele gate in Congress, same as a territory. The postal service shows a deficit on account of the Southern States. This is the old story. The South never did pay its pos tage, and never will till education becomes mo e general among its people. Congress. Congress met on Monday aud a quorum was present in both Houses. The creden tials of Senators Polund and Edmunds of this State were presented, and they were sworn in. The late elections have evi dently increased the strength of the Union and radical element in Congress and some of the members are a'most rampant. In the House a bill was immediately passed the effect of which is to prevent the Pres ident from pardoning any more rebels. The vote on the passage of this bi 1 was 111 to 29. Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois offered a resolution calling upon the Presi dent for information as to " how near the veige of the government the present body call d a Congress is at present, and if it is not nearer the centre than he formerly supposed. At a caucus of the Union members, Mr. Stevens declared, amid great laughter, that he was too conservative " last ses sion, that he had been rebuked for it by his constituents and that he was now go ing to catch up with them. Gov. Bout well of Mass., and others made very radi cal speeches. Hon. J. S. Morrill of this Sta:c was Chairman of the caucus. Tns Listing Laws. A large number of bills were introduced in the legislature relating to the grand list, but only one was passed. On the last day of the session in AitiiEST op Scheatt. John II. Sur- ratt, one of the assassins ot President Lincoln, has finally been caught and ar rested in Egypt, by U. S. Consul Halo, nnd will be forwarded to this country. There is much rejoici g at this event, and hopes are entei tained that some of the mysteries of the assassination may be cleared up by his tri;d or confession. Third District. The official vote for member of Congress in the third dis trict has been announced and is as fol lows : Whole number of votes, 1 1,250. W. C. Smith, 5730 ; A. O. Aldis, 2791 ; W. Brigham, 2680; Scattering 44; Smith's plurality 2936, and his majority 210. Tho danger of electing a democrat in that district is not very apparent, even if the Union party do split.
