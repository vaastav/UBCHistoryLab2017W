In the face of existing world-wide ' financial conditions, the Mutual Bene- 1 fit Life-Insurance Company announces j its third substantial increase in divi- ! dends on premium paying policies in force on January 1, 1915, of about J 20 per cent over the scale effective < 9 1Q1 A Tn r?a litncr up tu uc^ciiiucr o, iaii. au v??...0 attention to the facts that the divi- ( dend scale was materially increased < in 1910 and again in 1912, and that two special dividends were paid out in 1913 and 1914, respectively, the management modestly announces "To our knowledge the record is one which has not been equalled by any other life insurance company." As an illustration of the increase, we will take the case of a man 45 years of age, who took out a $2,000 policy in 1914. The agent very likely told him that according to the scale then effective, he might expect a reduction of $9.14 in the premium in 1915, but in reality the reduction will be $12.24. A proportionate increase applies to all other ages and all kinds of policies except term. The foregoing information is given especially for the benefit of the hundreds of Mutual Benefit policy holders in York county, who have learned by experience ' of the goodness and liberality of this company.
