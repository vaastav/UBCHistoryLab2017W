LOUIS Union News Company, Union Dent. WASHINGTON. P. C Iiis House and Ebbitt ' Mr. Cleveland speaks of "the recent finan cial perturbation." Some people are under the Impression that It still prevails. Congress may Impose an Income tax, but no person whoso Income does not exceed $3,000 a year need be afraid of being hit. A Congressman's salary Is $.",000 a year. If the President would declare his present opinion respecting Mr. J. J. Van Alen he would pronounce him an ass of the blue ribbon degree for publishing that remark able letter. If Mr. Cleveland doe3 not hear something definite soon from his minister to Honolulu he may feel Impelled to send out another special commissioner with paramount power to Investigate and report. Those papers which predicted that the President's message "will be of unusual Importance" cannot lay claim to the gift of prophecy. It might have been of unusual importance, but It was not. The only really original phrase !n the message Is that which designates the great est panic of recent tinus as "the recent financial perturbation." That is equal to JCasby's "late onpleasantness." Washington gossip says that In anticipa tion of being in a minority in the next House the Democrats will try to accomplish as much legislation as possible this session. They see the handwriting on the wall. There l3 a coterie of gentlemen who are now of the opinion that Mr. Cleveland Is o better than h'3 rartv. It embraces ilessrs. Schurz, MacVeagh and Foulke. Still, the Journal clings to a different convic tion. The ostrich hides its head in the sand and thinks Its whole body Is concealed. Mr. .Cleveland makes a passing reference to "the recent financial perturbation" and Im agines he .has consigned the great panic of 

ISOZ to oblivion. So much has been said pro and con in regard to the extent of the Income tax which the ways and means committee will report to the House that the committee itself may feel relieved, now that the Pres ident has announced what it has agreed upon. One of the results of the publication of the Wilson tariff bill Is a reduction of 10 per cent. In wages upon a pay roll of 523,000 per week in the saw works of Henry Dlsaton's Sons, Philadelphia. The Wilson bill makes a large reduction in the duty on all kinds of saws. Undoubtedly Mr. Cleveland is the first President to officially inform the House of Representatives what its ways and means committee has agreed upon as a report to that body, as he does when he declares that that comraitteee has decided to limit the income tax to corporations. The oft-repeated statement of anti Catholic orators that the Catholic hier archy at Rome was in a conspiracy to de stroy the Union during the late war is without foundation la fact, a3 is the other statement to th effect that three-fourths of the Union de3rters were Catholics. The futur historian will never know from rndlng the President's message of 1803 that the United States was just emerg ing from the most disastrous finaacial panic on reerd and vtas still in the throes of universal busings dvrcre!n. He wiU only ltora that there had bexm a "recnt Inan cltal perturbation." The President not enly betrays annoyance but displays wrath when he turns upon his old admirers but more recent critics, Schurz, MacVeagh, William Dudley Foulke and others, by reference to "the querulous Impracticability of many self-constituted guardians" of civil service reform. The President Informs these gentlemen that none can be friends of his unless they con stantly burn incense to hU Infallibility. The President devotes much space to the necessity as well as the virtue of close economy In public affairs. The theory Is excellent, but one does not see that the administration has given a practical Illus tration of it since the expenditures for everything, except pensions, were larger the last live months than during the cor responding period of the Harrison admin istration. Hut Mr. Cleveland has always been something of a Pecksniff. The Van Alen affair Is very funny for everybody except the President and his friends. Mr. Van Alen declined the ofllee and wrote his reasons, which, condensed into a word, are that he is disgusted. The President writes Van Alen to stick, that he selected him for his fitness, and It was uot worth while to heed the offensive re marks which have been made regarding hia appointment. Again, Van Alen writes tfcat he has enough. The rumor of Van Alen's declination got out. When Secretary Gresham was questioned he had heard nothing about it. Thereupon Van Alen gave the whole thing to the newspapers. The President probably did not Intend hl3 letter for publication, else he v,ould not havs stig matized the opposition to the Van Alen appointment as "noise and clamor," while the Secretary of State never dreamed of such an act of discourtesy on the part of Van Alen, else he would not-Jiavc denied the fapt, of tha declination. SO SI 12 

POINTS IN TUG MCSSAGE. The President's message will be a disap pointment to the country. No message in recent years has been looked forward to with greater Interest, and few, if any, have been more devoid of original ideas, valuable suggestions or practical recom mendations. Reyond a summary and re capitulation of the department reports It contains but little of interest. The greater portion of It 13 devoted to minor matters of detail, most of which are already within the information of Congress and the pub lic, and the President's presentation cf which adds nothing to their interest. The four topics of real importance are the Hawaiian affair, the financial situa tion, the pension question and the tarift question. As might be expected, the first of those topics is treated in a spirit of prejudice and partisan misrepresentation. Xo person who knows Mr. Cleveland's habit of basing conclusions on prejudice and his obstinacy in maintaining such con clusions in spite of convincing evidence to the contrary would expect him to recede from the position long since assumed by him on the Hawaiian question. There Is every reason to believe that his mind was already made up when he took the oath of office that the revolution In Hawaii and the annexation movement were "a put-up job," and that he was already determined to undo all that had been done. Every act of Y.s, of Secretary Gresham's and of Com missioner Blount's bears out this view. It Is not surprising, therefore, to find Mr. Cleveland adhering with dogged obstinacy to his original view. He says: Mr. Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the con stitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active old of our repre sentative to that government, and throusTi the Intimidation caused by the presence of nn armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. This is an astonishing statement to come from the President of the United States. The same statement coming from Commis sioner Blount was denounced by ex-Mlnis-ter Stevens as "shameless perversion of fact" and "astounding misrepresentations and untruths." Their repetition by the President does not change their character. Commissioner Blount's report, ex parte as it was. did not show what the m President says It did, for his strongest and most rep utable witness testified positively that the United States troops, after landing, abso lutely refused to take sides, and did not lift a finger In favor of the provisional gov ernment. Going outside of the report, the evidence Is overwhelmingly conclusive that the landing of the troops had nothing to do with the promulgation or establishment of the provisional government. But public opinion is formed on this question, and it is not worth while to argue It. The Presi dent has simply given another proof that when his mind is made up on an ex parte presentation of a case It Is Impervious to the truth. He says our present minister at Honolulu has been instructed to undo the wrong "accomplished by our unjusti fiable interference," but that "thus far no Information of the accomplishment of any definite result has been received from him." The Journal reiterates Its prediction that in so far as the Cleveland policy contem plates the overthrow of the provisional government and the restoration of the mon archy it will prove a disgraceful failure. The President's treatment of the financial question is weak and unsatisfactory. The figures relative to the production of gold and silver, the total amount of coinage ot both metals, the amount of money In cir culation, the number and circulation of na tional banks, etc., are neither new nor in teresting. Beyond a passing reference In a single sentence to "the recent financial perturbation," there Is no allusion to the great Clevelind panic. There 13 no discus sion of the silver question and no recom mendation for legislation on the subject. There is no reference to the evils of our present currency system, and. of course, no suggestion of a remedy for them. There 13 no reference to the fact that, owing to the early withdrawal of our bonds, a sub stitute will soon have to be provided for the national bank system. In short, the most Important question now before the country, and the one that comes closest home to the greatest number of people, the great, all-Including, all-absorbing cur rency question, is absolutely Ignored. The message, as a whole is not up to the standard of Mr. Cleveland's previous mes sages. It lacks the ring cf conviction and the impression of earnestness. It Is neither aggressive nor forceful, and is conspicu ously lacking in vigorous thought or strong expression. Mr. Cleveland seems to be los ing his grip. 

TARIFF AM) PENSIONS. Mr. Cleveland's first ofiiclal expression upon the tariff question shows that he has received no new ideas since his last annual message to Congress. When first elected he confessed that he did not know any thing about the tariff. He feil In with a few free traders who poured into his ears the current free trade assumptions, the chief of which is that the duty Ls added to the foreign price of goods whether man ufactured abroad or here; that there is a market of the world, and that the Ameri can market is narrow, leaving the Ameri can workingman unemployed a consider able portion of every year, and that the manufacturer Is a monopolist. So much of misinformation Mr. Cleveland acquired In 1SSG-M, and he has retained It. The fact that the people of the I'nitcd States, being one-twentieth of the world's population, conhume one-fifth of the world's products of labor and capital, Including more than one-fourth of the world's output of iron, lumber and textiles, has lel him to suspect that American markets are not narrow. The impartial and nonpartisan report of the- Senate committee, showing from actual statistics that the cost of living ls not higher here than In Europe, and that the wages of the Amercan workingman are from GO to 130 per cent, higher than in the same employments in Europe, and that In the course of the year he receives twice as much on an average as European com petitors cannot affect a mind stuffed with the bigotry' of Cobden Club maxims. Mr. Cleveland ls an Ideal Bourbon in that he cannot learn. To-day Mr. Cleveland ls a free trader as distinguished from a pro tectionist In what the President has to say In re gard to pensions, his old-time hostility to the system reappears. He Insists that stu pendous frauds exist, and for that reason a scheme was devised for suspending such cases as bore evidence, of fraud. If stu pendous frauds exist, why have they not been discovered and proclaimed? If such frauds are as general as the President's assertions declare, why has not the ma chinery of the government been able to bring them to light? The truth Is, the con spiracies to .defraud the government by adding names to the pension list are few and limited. The Harrison administration had discovered the most extensive con spiracies of that sort one In Virginia and one in Baltimore and Mr. Cleveland's peo ple have discovered another conspiracy in New Mexico and still another in Iowa both of limited dimensions. These four conspiracies to defraud the government by pensions do not involve a hundred cases each. And yet the President, with no facts to sustain him, exhausts his vocabu lary of five-syllable expletives to depict the generality and enormity of frauds upon the government in the Pension Bureau! It is the same old slander, and, in the way he puts it, an Insult to every veteran who re ceived or has sought a pension. The Pres ident's observations regarding the tariff are those of a man simply stupid and obstinate, but his outburst regarding pen sions is the expression of a malignant. Washington dispatches describing the opening of- the Senate contain the stereo typed twaddle concerning the fine "floral offerings" on the desks of Senators. These are always represented as coming from "admiring friends," a phrase that is in tended to convey an idea of great public services rendered. As a matter of fact, they come from the government botanical gardens. These gardens .are under the con trol of the Joint committee on library, of which Senator Voorhees is chairman. The dispatch says, "A handsome floral horse shoe awaited Senator Voorhees, the gift of admiring friends, who also remembered his colleague, Senator Turpie." Of course. A dozen other Senators and the Vice Presi dent had floral offerings all ordered from the botanical gardens by Senator Voorhees. There is nothing mean about our senior Senator when It comes to distributing gov ernment flowers. It might have been expected that the President, In his annual mesage. would have something to say about the great financial panic of 1S33, discussing Its causes and effects, drawing some instructive les sons, or giving some warnings against a recurrence of similar conditions. He must have given the subject a great deal of thought, and if he has any knowledge of the principles of finance he must have reached some conclusions that would be of public interest. Here Is what he says on the subject: Of course, after the recent financial per turbation, time Is necessary for the re-establishment of business confidence. That Is the only reference in the entire message to the greatest financial panic In the history of the country. It was a "financial perturbation." and he thinks It will take some time for confidence to be re stored. That's all. Mr. Cleveland says Minister Willis went to Honolulu with instructions "to restore, as far as practicable, the status existing at the time of our forcible Intervention." This Implies a falsehood. There was no forcible Intervention on the part of the United States In Honolulu. Ex-MInlster Stevens, in hl3 printed statement, says: "It was nearly fifty hours after Liliuokalanl and her favorites had destroyed her throne by a revolutionary outbreak when the men of the Boston were landed." Again he says: "To all proper inquiries my answer was that the United States marines could not take sides." What does Mr. Cleveland rr.can by talking about "our forcible inter vention?" The selection of Mr. It. M. Seeds for secretary of the Republican central com mittee, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Millikan. is an excellent one. Mr. Seeds is a zealous Republican, a well-Informed man, an indefatigable work er and possesses In a high degree those qualifications which are essential to suc cess in the position which he has been urged to accept by Republicans who are most fntimately acquainted with him. Mr. F. M. Millikan. who has resigned the secretaryship of the Republican State committee, a position which he held so long and the duties of which he so faith fully discharged, carries with him the con fidence and esteem of as many Republic ans as It is the good fortune of a man of his years to know. To the E lltor of the Indianapolis Journal: 1 What is the estimated wealth of Chi cago? 2. What is the wealth of ten of the wealthiest men In the United States? B. 1. Cook county, the larger part of which is within the city limits, had a valuation of srr0.000.CM') in 1S02 for the purpose of taxation. The tax valuation of Illinois is put at one-fourth of the real value. 2. No one could tell, not even the ten them- eelvcs, what their wealth is, and the only estimates are those of men who sell what they imagine as facts to newspapers. The alleged wealth of the rich varies from period to period. When stocks fell a few months ygo, the fortunes of many million aires shrunk millions. From the fact that, when the estates of millionaires are scheduled after their decease, they are rarely one-third as large a iopularly esti mated, it is fair to assume that all al leged estimates of the wealth of the richest are much Inflated. To the Editor of the Indianapolis Journal: When does the term of office of road supervisors expire, and will their success ors be elected or appointed? M. The last act of the legislature relative to road supervisors was approved March C. 1SD1, and went into effect at once. It provider for the election of such officers and mal es the term of office four years. It would seem, therefore, that the super visors were elected in April, 1S91, and that their terms will expire in April, lSi5, when their successors will be elected. 

CARLISLE'S FIGURES Annual Estimates of Appropria tions for Next Fiscal Year. Amounts Asked for Indiana Officials, the ilariou Soldiers' Home and Min ister Gray's Secretar)-. THE INDIANAPOLIS ARSENAL Nearly 839,000 Needed for Sew ers, Pavements and Fences. Total of $ilMS7!Mll Necessary to Carry On the business of the Goverment Nothing for the Sugar Bounty. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Secretary Car lisle's annual estimates of appropriations for the coming fiscal year were received at the Capitol to-day, and contain many feat ures of interest to Journal readers. He recommends for the expense accounts of collectors, deputies and clerks In the two Internal revenue districts of Indiana an aggregate of $13,100, of which $25,000 goes to the Sixth district and $18,500 to the Seventh district. He asks for an additional appro . priatlon of $200 for the expense account of the district attorney for Indiana. For the' branch National Soldiers' Home, located at Marion, appropriations are requested in the aggregate of $2,530,131, which ls an In crease over the appropriation for the pres ent fiscal year amounting to $51,508. Two new barracks are provided for at a cost of $50,000. Upon the recommendation of the Secre tary of State an Increase of saiary for the secretary of Minister Gray's legation at Mexico Is recommended. The following statement by Secretary Gresn,am is Incor porated in Secretary Carlisle's estimates: "The mission to Mexico is now and has been for several years past of the first class, but the salary of the secretary of legation has never been Increased. It re mains at $l,SLK), the amount designated when the mission was of the second class. It should, therefore, be placed on a par with that paid to other secretaries of le gation of the $17,500 grade, not only be cause of uniformity, but because the ac tual duties entitle the secretary to this small increase. The duties In Mexico are quite as exacting and the volume of work is as great, if not greater, than almost anywhere else. The department has sev eral times asked for this increase, and It now renews its request with additional confidence." FOR THE ARSENAL. Secretary Carlisle asks for an appropria tion of $3S,972, or $27J72 more than was ap propriated for this fiscal year, for the In d!anaiolis arsenal, and he subdivides the appropriation and explains the purposes as follows: "Construction of sewers to connect with the Indianapolis city sewer on Clifford ave nue. $S,5uu. This sewer is an imperative necessity. The arsenal sewage Is now dis charged into cesspools having an overflow Into Pogue's run within the arsenal limits. This arrangement for the arsenal alone might be endured for some time longer but for the additional Woodruff Place sewage, which makes I'ojnie'a run at times a stream of filth through the arsenal and the heart of the city, and a serious menace to the health of the whole community. The city authorities are about to construct a sewer along Clifford avenue which will re ceive the sewage of Woodruff Place, and with which the arsenal sewer should also be connected Immediately. "One-half the cost of paving with ns pbaltum Michigan street along the south front of the arsenal, 1,200 feet, $8.S20. Ar senal avenue, from the south gate of the arsenal to Washington street, is being graded preparatory to paving with asphalt um. and it is understood to be the Intention of the city government to pave Michigan street also as soon as Congress makes an appropriation for one-half the expense across the arsenal front. It N contended that, as the United States claims jurisdic tion to the middle of the street (or thirty feet) outside the arsenal fence, it would be unjust and a great hardship to compel property-holders on the opposite side to pay the whole cost of this portion of the street improvement. The United States has al ready constructed a concrete sidewalk ten feet wide along the soutn front of this street. "One-half the cost of paving with as phaltum Clifford avenue along the north front of the Arsenal, 1.260 feet, $8,820. The same reasons exist for paving this street as for paving Michigan street, and the same protests are made by property hold ers against being assessed the whole cost while the United States owns and claims jurisdiction over one-half the width of the street. "Concrete sidewalk ten feet wide along the north front of th Arsenal on Clifford avenue, 1.2o0 feet. $2,016. This sidewalk is needed to replace an old one constructed by the United States many years ago of brick, and which is now badly broken, un even and in may places sunken out of sight. "Iron fence, with cut stone base, along the north front of the Arsenal on Clifford avenue, 1.200 feet, J5.SS0. Construction of an Iron fence along the west side of the Arsenal on Hanna street. 2.4CS feet. $4.03. The fence on the north front along Clifford avenue Is now an old and much dilapidated wooden one which presents a very unsight ly appearance to people passing! on that city thoroughfare. The fence estimated for Is similar to that just completed along the south front. The fence on liie wet side, along Hanna street, is also of wood, ami In very bad condition. It must be rebuilt very soon In wood if not Iron. The fence contemplated In the estimate for this side Is of cheaper deslcrn than that on the south front, but will be substantial and durable. This estimate covers the entire cost of the stone foundation for these fences, but only the cost of the iron for the superstructure. It Is expected that with the aid of one or two mechanics the work may be done in the new shop, when completed, by the la bor of enlisted men. The fence along Woodruff Place, on the east Fide, is also of wood, but in fair condition, having ben rebuilt only a few years ago. With paint ing, it may Iv made to last several years longer. The rV1d growth of the city about the Arsenal i.'.akes a better surrounding fence a necessity to kep out trespassers as well as to give it a v.ell-cared-for ap pearance befitting a United States military establishment." GENERAL, ESTIMATES. The total amount estimated by Mr. Car lisle as necessary to carry. on the govern ment for the fiscal year is $111,879,041, as against estimates for 1S93-'01 of $121.C12,215, and appropriations for 1S04 of $132,150., 72$.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-The United States Supreme Court to-day rendered an opinion which, while affirming the consti tutionality of the alien contract labor law, will embarrass to some extent the practical enforcement of the law. The question came up on the appeal of Joseph Lees and John S. Lees from a decision of the United States Circuit Court for the eastern dis trict of Pennsylvania, fining them $1,000 for importing Frederick Grayham, of England, to perform labor in their mill at Bridge port, Pa. The court holds that the act is valid, but when the accused parties were compelled to give evidence against them selves In a criminal proceeding their con stitutional rights were violated, and hence reverses the decision.

Condemns the Vairrancy Law ami Says Those Who Sleep Outdoors and Have No Work Are Not Criminals. TOPEIvA, Kan.; Dec. 4. One of the most remarkable circulars ever issued by the ex ecutive of any State was sent out by Gov. Lewelling to-day. The letter Is addressed to all boards of police commissioners In Kansas, and practically renders nugatory' all "vagrant laws. After reciting the hard ships of the poor In olden times, speaking specially of the reign of Elizabeth and in France Just previous to the revolution, the Governor reviews the present condition of affairs among the poorer classes in the country. He scores the laws now on the statute books which calls the man out of work and penniless a "confidence man." Speaking of the vagrancy law of Kansas, he says: "It separates men into two distinct class es, differentiated as those who are penni less and those who are not, and declares the former criminals. Only the latter are en titled to the liberty guaranteed by the Con stitution. To be found in a city without visible means of support or some legitimate business Is the Involutary condition of some millions at this moment, and under these laws we proceed to punish them for being victims to conditions which we, as a peo ple, have forced upon them." The circular, then continues as follows: "I have noticed in police court reports that 'sleeping In a box car Is among the varie ties of this heinous crime of being poor. Some police judges have usurped a sov ereign power, not permitted the highest function of the States or of the Nation, and victims of Industrial conditions have been 'ordered to leave town.' The right to go ire sly from place to place in search of em ployment or even "in obedience to a mere whim, ls part of that personal liberty guar anteed by the Constitution of the United States to every human being on American soil. Evea voluntary idleness is not for bidden. If a Diogenes prefer poverty, if a Columbus choose hunger and the discovery of a new race, rather than stek personal comfort by engaging In 'some legitimate business, I am aware of no power in the legislature, or in the city councils, to deny him the right to seek happiness ia his own way, so lorg as he harms no other person. If men commit offerees let them be arrest ed and punished whether rich" or poor; but let slmpla poverty cease to be a crime. "In some cities It is provided by ordi nance that if Police Court tines are not paid or secured, the culprit shall be com pelled to work out the amount as a munici pal slave, and 'rock piles' and 'bull pens' are provided for the enforcement of these ordinances. And so it- appears that this slavery is not Imposed as a punishment, but solely as a means of collecting a debt. Such city ordinances are in flagrant viola tion of the constitutional prohibitions. The 'rock pile' and the 'bull pens' would never have been used In degrading the friendless and poor. Let these twin relics of the de parted auction block era cease to disgrace the cities of Kansas. And let the dawn of Christmas find the 'rock pile' and the 'bull pen.' and the crime of being homeless and Ioor, obsolete in all the cities of Kansas governed by the Meropolitan police act. "It is confidently expected that their own regard for constitutional liberty find their humane impulses will Induce police com missioners to carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the foregoing suggestions."

VAN ALKN CONGRESS IN SESSION The President's Message Read to Senators anil Representatives. Hawaiian Part Inadvertently Skipped by the Secretary of the Senate Flowers for Voorhees and Turpie. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. The first regu lar session of the Fifty-third Congress convened at 1 o'clock to-day, pursuant to the constitutional provisions. The Senate chamber presented a fresh appearance, the furnishings being new. On some of the desks were floral designs and flowers, whose fragrance sweetened the at mosphere ahd lent an additional charm to the scene. On the desk of the Vice Presi dent reposed a basket of roses, while a handsome floral horseshoe awaited Senator Voorhees, the gift of admiring friends, who also remembered his colleague. Sen ator Turpie. In the galleries a large crowd had gathered to witness the opening of the session, and the bright colors in the ladies' gowns and bonnets were the more conspicuous because of the somber-hued background. As the massive clock over the main en trance announced the hour of 12 o'clock the blind chaplain was led up to the Vice President's desk, and after an eloquent prayer, while all Senators present re mained standing. Vice President Stevenson called the Senate to order. At the sugges tion of Senator Sherman, the roll of the Senate was called, and fifty-six Senators responded. The usual resolutions notifying the House of the meeting of the Senate and the resolution for a committee of two Senators to join a similar committee of the House to wait upon the President of the United States and Inform him that Congress had assembled and was ready to receive any communication he may de sire to make were offered and agreed to. The Chairman appointed Mr. Mcpherson and Mr. Sherman as the committee on the part of the Senate. After a resolution had been adoptad that the hour of daily meet ing of the Senate shall be 12 o'clock, me ridian, on the motion of Senator Harris, a recess at 12:10 was taken for one hour, to enable the committee to wait on the Presi dent. At 1:23 Executive Secretary Pruden ap peared, delivered the President's message, and It was laid before the Senate by the Vice President, who directed its reading by the secretary of the Senate, Mr. Cox. All pie sent, with few execeptions, gave close attention to the document. There was a general changing about in the seats of Sei atcrs wnen the portion of the document dealing with Hawaii was approached. Many of the Senators had, however, anticipated the seer2tary's reading by turniiiK in their printed copies to this portion, so that very few of them apparently observed that the P2ge containing the President's brief com munication on Hawaii was 'turned without being read by the secretary. Senator Kyle was one of the few Senators who followed the reading sufficiently close to obsarve the omission, and he called attention to the oversight by sending up a note calling at tention to the fact. Alter this incident there was an evident falling off In Interest on the part Ot Senators, but attention was brielly revived when the paragraph con cerning bonds was reached. When this paragraph was passd the Senators grad ually left their seats and went out Into the clcak rooms, so that by the time the read ing had been two-thirds finished there were hardly twenty-five Senators In the chamber, and a majority, of these were engaged in conversation among themselves. The reading of the message was concluded at 3 o'clock, having occupied approximately one hour and a half. Mr. Dolph immediately arose and said there had been distributed in the Senate printed copies of what purported to be the message of the President, In which, on page y, he found a part of a page devoted to Hawaii, and he did not hear tnat portion read from the desk.- He desired to know, and thought the country did also, whether that part was inadvertently or puriosely omitted by the secretary, or whether the copies which had been circulated were not true copies of the message. The Vice President responded that tle portion of the message relating to Hawaii had been inadvertently omitted by the sec retary and directed that it be read. This was done, and Mr. Dolph gave no tice that he would on to-morrow address the Senate on that part of the message. The message was .ordered to lie on the table. Numerous petitions were presented and many bills introduced and referred to ap propriate committees. A joint resolution permitting Col. Anson Mills. U. S. A., to rerve as engineer on the ccmmisslon to survey and fix ths boundary between the United States and Mexico, was passed. A message was receive Horn tne House announcing tho death of the Hon. Charles O'Neill and Hon. Willlim Lilley. late Representatives from Pennsylvania, and as a mark of respect to the deceased the Sen ate, at 3:51, adjourned. Tin: house.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-The encircling galleries of the House, except those re served for the President and the diplomatic corps, which looked glnorm" and vacant, were filled fo overflowing v-ith eager and expectant persons when Speaker Crisp, dig nified and stately, ascended the rostrum at high noon to-day and rapjred the regular session of the Fiftyrthird Congress to or der. Fully three hundred members were in their seats. Conspicuous upon the floor were the two vacant chairs of Representa tive O'Neill, of Pennsylvania, the "Father of the llouso," and his colle-ije, Mr. Lilly, the Representative at lare from the Key Stone State. Their desks were draped in black and covered with floral tributes. Rev. JJagby, in his Invocation, feelingly spoke of the death of "Father" O'Neill and Mr. Lilly. According to the rule at the opening of the session, the Shaker then directed i the Clerk to call the roll in order to offi cially ascertain the presence of a quorum. H. S. Rundy. of Ohio, elected to succeed the late Representative Enochs, and Mr. Grif fin, successor of the late Mr. Cnipman, of . Detroit, were sworn in. ! A resolution appropriating J50,(oj addl ! tional to J ay the silaries of oiiiclals engagei In the enforcement of the Chinese tlriortu- tion ahd re'it naion act of lt May and me amendment to that act passed at the extra, session was parsed.

Mr. Kilgore objected, and the resolution was referred under the rules. After the appointment of the usual com mittees to notifv the Senate and the Pres ident that the llouse had organized, a re cess until 1:10 p. m. was taken. At 1:"" the White House executive clerk appeared with the President's message, and Speaker Crisp immediately laid it Pefore the House, which had reconvened at the hour set. Clerk Kerr read It In a clear, firm voice. The galleries remained silent, and the mem bers leaning forward in their chairs listened attentively to Mr. Cleveland's views as they fell from the lips of the Clerk of the House. During the reading of the first portion of the message relating to our for eign relations ex-Speaker Thomas Reed burst through a side door and came rolling across the area in front of the Speaker's rostrum. When he reached the seat he de liberately lighted a cigar and 6at putTin? away complacently while the reading pro ceeded. As the reference to the Hawaiian affair was reached the members straight ened up and gave the closest possible at tention, but no expression of approval or disapproval was Indulged in. There seemed to be a general air of disappointment, however, that so little space was alotted to this question. The recommendations rel ative to an International monetary confer ence and the request for further authority for the issue of bonds caused many signifi cant shakes of the head on the part of the extreme silver men. The .President's boll indorsement of the pension policy cf tho Interior Department, of civil service reform, and his appeal for rigid economy In i propriatlons nlso attracted attention. When the referent to the tariff was reached the members crowded about the Clerk's desk. The forceful utterances relative to the duty of Congress on the tariff question and the hearty indorsement given the Wilson bill seemed to please the Democratic mem bers greatly, but much surprise was evident! when that section of the message was read stating that the way3 and means committee had embraced In its plans several addi tional internal revenue taxes and a small tax on the Incomes of certain corporations. As it was understood the Internal revenue features and the income tax had not been absolutely decided upon the President's an nouncement came in the nature of a sur prise. A round of applause preeted the con clusion of the reading of the message. General Ringham. who had been selected by the Pennsylvania delegation to make the announcements of the deaths of Repre sentatives O'Neill and Lilly, was then ree oenized. A committee consisting of Messrs. McDowell, Mutchler, Northway, Robinson, Curtis, Whiting and' Tate was appointed to attend the funeral of the late Repre sentative O'Neill, of Pennsylvania, and then, at 3 p. m., as a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased members, the House adjourned. 

LEHIGH VALLEY STRIKE. ' Conference of the Joint Arbitrators' Committee and Old Employes. BETHLEHEM, Pa., Dec. 4. A conference between the Joint arbitrators' committee representing the boards of the States of New .York and New Jersey on the one hand., and the representafives of the Le high Valley railroad strikers on the other, was begun here at 3 o'clock this afternoon In the Eigle Hotel. The situation was dis cussed In all Its phases for three hours, and at the end of this time no conclusion having been reached, the conference took a recess. Information as to what transpired during to-day'8 session vas denied to re porters. General Manager Voorhees to-day said: "The situation to-day along the line is fine and everything is in Rood bhape." The strikers are showing more hopeful faces, and express the belief that the dally occurrence of accidents and the destruction of epgines through the. inexperience of the Lehigh's present hands will cause a back down on the part of the company. The fight grows daily more bitter, and it looks, the strikers say, as though It would spread to the Jersey Central and other roads. JOY AT
