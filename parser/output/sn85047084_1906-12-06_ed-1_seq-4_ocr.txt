THS PACIFIC COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, HONOLULU. DECEMBER 6, 1906. THE PACITIO Birbe development, whether these men bought their releases and if so, who got the money? Perhaps, if the released prisoners were looked up by the grand jury they would give some mighty interesting testimony. POWER COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER. r WALTER Q. SMITH EDIT OB THURSDAY : DECEMBER 6. the message appears THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Dissatisfied with the failure of the Associated Press to send the usual abstract of the President's message to the papers here, this journal wired to the western office of the A. P. yesterday, asking it to repair the omission at the Advertiser's expense. The result is the profoundly interesting cablegram on the first page. Comment upon the sensational Japanese passages o elsewhere. By the Hawaiian paragraph, our readers will see that the President is still determined to build up a middle-class American citizenship here and that, until the planters shall consent to do their part in that work, the solution of the industrial and commercial problems of the Territory may receive scant aid from Washington. The other recommendations which vitally affect Hawaii are those which propose free trade or a reduced tariff for the Philippines, a subsidy for Amer- o-n t;na pirizpnshin for Porto Ricans and legislation against child The latter proposal, if enacted, might especially affect the earning power our Portuguese families.

MORE SCANDAL ? Does the Board of Supervisors extvect to fool all of the people all of the time? rserore election tne Hoard raised tne ponce appropriation to .ih.UU( per month, ostensibly to provide more police, actually to provide Brown with more politicians in t lie guise of police. Supervisor Lucas, after this had been done, publicly accounted for the appropriation in that way. After election it was urged in the Board to lower the appropriation to the old figures, and the Supervisors, instead of doing so, as economy and common- sense dictated, reterreu the question to a dilatory committee. That committee. week after week, asks for "more time" and the money keeps flowing into Brown's hands. e put two questions: Has the delay been caused by a desire to give the Sheriff enough of the people's money to pay the expenses of the recount1.' no tne present supervisors think that tne taxpayers have neither eves, ears, noses nor memories? labor. of THE 

CRISIS WITH JAPAN. The message of the President on the Japanese question would be extra ordinary if it were not for the as yet unpublished facts about the crisis. Mr. Roosevelt has gone to the length of stigmatizing California civilization; of threatening to use the civil or military power to enforce the treaty with Japan a statement which hints at martial law and the possible suspension of the writ of habeas corpus; has asked for laws to enable the President to supersede State authorities in all matters which trench upon international affairs and has even gone so far as to suggest the naturalization of Japanese. It is no light and trivial affair of diplomacy which has led the President to make such far-reaching declarations. For lack of knowledge Congress has treated the President's message with no great respect and the Coast press with less; but the Senate has asked for the diplomatic correspondence with Japan and if that body gets it all, we shall expect to see a spirit of sobriety fall upon both law-makers and journalists. Wie shall have no more indiscretions of the Raynor type; at least, so it is to be hoped. In writing of this matter the other day, the Advertiser gave aa inkling of the private news it had as to the real gravity of the Japanese- American situation. It could tell more; but what it has known ' for some I time may today become public property if the President responds fully to the Senate's request. Then our own public will see how essential it is that the j naseinn of .Japanese subiects should stop and realize the entire wisdom of , the President 's otherwise inexplicable course. The Advertiser would be glad to receive from the exhibitors at the jhotographic display, copies of pictures of scenes in and about Honolulu for use in its February special number. It is desired to have new pictures for that edition. Photographs sent in for the purpose, marked with the owner's name, will be credited in their published form and the original print returned- The Advertiser desires the co-operation of amateur as well as professional photographers in the pictorial featuring of its great number. ost ; conomical to operate Electricity is the cleanest, most reliable and powL-i you can possioiy use, wnetner von wisn anything from a sewing- machine or small lathe, up to heav plantation machinery.

The outcome we hope for, in the trouble with Japan, is not only a peaceable understanding with that country but a constitution1 amendment by which the States shall bind themselves to the principle, which is essential to the power cf the government, that all laws and ordinances, in derogation of the treaty rights of aliens, shall, by that fact, be held invalid.

LSI" i It is a vital prerogative of a nation acting as such through its central govern ment. The excuse hitherto given by the United States that it can not compel States to observe treaty rights, has never been accepted by Europe and this country has been obliged to vevade the issue and satisfy foreign claimants in some roundabout way. Thus, when Italian subjects were murdered in New Orleans by a mob which mistook them for members of a murder cabal called the Mafia, the Washington government, unable to do anything with New Orleans or Louisiana, paid an indemnity to the families of the dead out of its contingent fund and expressed its regret at the occurrence. Something of the sort was done to satisfy China in the matter of the slaughtered Chinese in Wyoming. Had the contingent fund been unable to meet the demand upon it, the Government would have had to wait for the assembly or the action of Congress, a delay which a strong and aggressive complainant might not, in such a crisis, be willing to share. And if Italy, in the Mafia case, had demanded the arrest and punishment of the murderers and if Louisiana had professed her inability to find or to convict them, what could the United States have done to meet its treaty obligations to Italy? The attitude of Great Britain, in the famous McLeod case, reported in this paper yesterday, was this: "That if the United States disclaimed re sponsibility for an offense against a Briton on the ground that it was solely pun ishable by the laws of New York, Great Britain would then proceed to exact reparation from New York." War was averted by the prompt acquittal of the political prisoner, the forcible detention of whom brought on the diplomatic, crisis referred to but the central question of national responsibility for State violation of treaty rights remained unsettled and has returned to plague us. It is sadly plaguing us now and if Japan should conclude to accept the British precedent and act upon it, California would be plagued exceedingly. A glance at the small roster of American ships in the Pacific now will show how little defensive aid could be supplied, for at least six or seven weeks, by the national authority.
