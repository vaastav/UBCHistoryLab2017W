PAUL, THURSDAY. DEO. 4, 1879. THE Republican party in Massachusetts which gave Grant a majority of nearly ninety thousand over Seymour, finds hard work, now-a-daye, to slow two thousand At the last State election in November Long's majority was only eighteen hundred votes. MB. BUOKNEB has introduced a bill for a tax on the consumption of whisky instead of on its manufacture. The thing won't work. If men were obliged to make returns on the amount of liquor consumed by them during the year, there would be a rioh har vest for the father of lies. IT must be a pleasant thing to be a repre sentative of this government in Mexico. During his recent tour through the country Minister Foster was accompanied by a guard of two hundred armed men to protect his precious carcass from any who might wish to indulge in rifle praotioe with his body for a target. THE Grant boom is swelling. Robeson has just declared for him, following the ex ample of Belknap, Williams, Fomeroy, Mc Donald, McKee and the rest of the unsavory gang. If there are any of the thieves of the Grant regime who have not pronounced in favor of their old chieftan, they had better step forward and record themselves. SHERMAN VOWS vengeance upon the man who purloined his report from the govern ment printing office. It is not at all prob able that he will ever be able to discover the culprit. Yet we would suggest that it may be the Rev. Dr. Lorimer, of Chicago, whose "unconscious memorization," and "satura- tion," may have enabled him to give it to the ungodly press. THE Representative from Colorado pro poses that the Ute reservation in Colorado be confiscated by the government and the Indians removed from the State. This will no doubt be done ultimately, so that those who have cast covetous eyes upon the rioh mineral deposits with which that section abounds may have the opportunity to grat ify their cupidity. FOB several months past the Republicans have been claiming that Louisiana was a Re publican State, and if permitted to hold a free election would so declare herself. An election was held on Tuesday at which there was no violence of any kind. The State had been imperfectly canvassed by both par ties, but nevertheless a full vote was out, and the Democratie ticket was elected by an overwhelming majority. Large numbers of the negroes cast their votes for the Demo cratic candidates, and appear to be as well pleased with the result as are their white brethren. ROTATION IN OFFICE, The usual contention about the distribu tion of offices has been resumed at Washing ton. At the extra session the Republicans in the Senate asked the privilege of retain ing sosae of the employes of that body who had served honorably in the war and were incapacitated by reason of wounds from other work. This request was granted, but it has been ascertained that with but three exceptions none of the Republicans re tained had ever served a day in the army. This discovery has led some of the Demo crats to insist that the programme inaugu rated by the Republicans of giving office to none but men of undoubted party fealty be carried out by the Democrats, and that all Republicans be made to walk the plank. The Republicans, however, talk a good deal about the rights of minorities, just as if, when they were in power, they recognized those rights. Mr. Hayes, in his annual message, de voted several oolumns to a sermon on the subjeot of civil service reform, and advj cated a searoh for the fittest men to occupy official positions, and, when they are found, their perpetual retention in office. His the ory is a very beautifal one, no doubt. Yet it is somewhat surprising that it was not discovered during the nineteen years in which the Republican party has held the reins of power. It is only when it is abso lutely certain that the party must step down and out that the beauties of the new system are discovered, a fact that leads to the pre sumption that it was invented only in the hope that it would avail to keep some Re publicans in office after the tenure of office of the party .has expired. Had the party practiced such a theory in the days when it had absolute sway, its present protestations would not be open to so much ridicule. As it is, the Republicans must expect to be dealt by as they have dealt with others. This question of the distribution of offices is not of vital importance to the welfare of the country. W presume that men can be found in both parties who are fitted to per form the duties of any office in the gift of the people or of the heads of the several de partments. It has happened thus far in our history that eaoh party has retained power for along enough period to keep its ohosen employes as long as men should be permit ted to live at the publio expense, and there has been no necessity for changes of such frequency as to in any way impair the pub lio service. Occasional changes are bene ficial. They promote increased activity, greater diligence and more faithfulness. It does any department of the government a great deal of good to have a new broom oc casionally, that will sweep out the rubbish and oobwebs that have accumulated through long years of indolence and half hearted work. It may not be good policy to ohange of fioials because of their political views. It is certainly bad policy to dismiss a good Re publican to make room for a bad Democrat or vice versa, but all things being equal we see no impropriety in the Democrats claim ing the fruits of success. If they were un able to do so, the chief incentive to exertion would be removed. As long as the privi lege is not abused there is no valid objection to its exeroise. and though the Republicans may squirm at being obliged to surrender their fat offices, they have no other alterna tive. 

HUDDLESTOFS LATEST. REJTOZNDER OB" SIRS. HXTI)IL,E8TOJi TO HER HUSBAND'S ANSWER, A Tale of Marital' TJnkapplnessHow [He Got Angry, and WhyChoking. Founu Ing, Kicking: Oat of Bed, Etc.Afrald^of Her Life, She Flees from Her Husband. Mrs. Haddleston put in a rejoinder to her husband's answer, in her suit for divorce. It opens with a raking fire and pours hot shot all the way through. It is as follows: The State of Minnesota, County of Ramsey District Court. Helen M. Huddleston vs. Thomas A. Huddles ton. The plaintiff, for reply to the answer of de fendant in this aotien, shows to the court. The plaintiff avers that at the time she mar ried the defendant she wan devotedly attached to him and she had no reason to doubt that her attachment was as warmly reciprocated. That the cruelty and inhumanity of the de fendant to her gradually destroyed her confi dence in and respect for him, and she was at last compelled to regard the defendant only with fear and dread. That when Harmon, the oldest child of the plaintiff, was about five weeks old, and when she was without servants to do the housework or cooking, the plaintiff oame home and order ed that some game be prepared and cooked for bis dinner. A sister of plaintiff who bad been with her and taken eare of her from the time of the birth of the said child of plaintiff, undertook to fill the orders of the defendant, and about the time she had the game ready for him to eat he became illnatnred and angry and in that mood sulkily left the house. That the plaintiff and her said sister kept the defendant's cooked game warm for him till evening at which time he returned and insist ed that the game cooked for dinner would not suit him, and that fresh game must at once be prepared and cooked for him. The condition of plaintiff was such that she could not well do this and the sister of plaintiff refused to do so, and this made the defendant madder than ever, and he grew furious and desperately abusive to both plaintiff and her sister. That the said acts of the defendant took place at the time referred to in the answer relative to the alleged interference by the sister of plain tiff with the defendant's household affairs, bat plaintiff denies that then or any time prior to her final leaving him, she left him for any pur pose of desertion, or for any other purpose than visiting her relatives, with the full knowledge and consent of defendant. At the time mentioned in the complaint, when defendant kicked plaintiff out of bed, the defendant bad. on the said night before said oc currence, been fretting and scolding her until after midnight, and the plaintiff was greatly agitated and wearied by bis said conduct, and begged him to allow her to go to sleep. This request ''irritated" the defendant to despera tion, and he at once with great anger and vio lence kicked plaintiff out of bed but plaintiff admits that her fall from the bed was only about fourteen inches. That as soon as plain tiff rose to her feet defendant, who had got out of bed, again thrust her upon the floor and when she again arose, defendant threw her upon the bed and com menced pounding her, and was finally "interfered with in bis family affairs," by the Bister of plaintiff and the daughter of defend ant, and by them palled away from plaintiff at,d held by them while plaintiff escaped from the room. The defendant then pulled down the plaintiff's clothes whioh were hanging in a closet and in a great rage ordered her to leave. That the plaintiff was greatly injured on said occasion by the defendant and on ace mnt of the same was confined to her couch some three days. The plaintiff avers that she has always tried, while she lived with the defendant, to make his home a happy and prosperous one, bat that all her efforts failed, by reason of the manner and conduct of the defendant, which seldom failed to become shadowed with gloomy appre hensions of a storm of wrath and abuse when he entered his dwelling, and as a rale his de portment, while at home, was abusive to such a degree that all dreaded his coming and fear pedominate over every other sentiment. That it was a constant and painful study of the plaintiff to devise means to keep the de fendant good-natured when he came home. That it was the habit of defendant to remain out nearly all night and come home at late hoars and often in a state of intoxication that if not under the influence of liquor he would come home feeling ugly and ill natured, and keep plaintiff awake till morning, scolding, threatening and abusing her. That plaintiff, on account of her children and household du ties, was obliged to be upin the morning at an early hour, while defendant usually remained in bed till nine or ten o'clock, or later, and re quired a separate meal when he was ready for it. That when plaintiff got np in the morning defendant would often require her to leave his room and dress in another, so as not to disturb him. On some occasions, when the abuse of defendant became unendurable and she became fearful of personal injury, she would escape from MB bed and seek refuge in the bed of Minniethe daughter of defendant. On one occasion, about four months before her daughter Mary was born, while plaintiff was in bed with defendant, he scolded, threat ened and abused her to such an extent that she attempted to get out of his bedand leave the room, but defendant caught her and locked her in the room, where she spent the remainder of the night on the floor. The next day the arms of plaintiff were Dlaok and blue from injuries received at the hands of the defendant. The defendant nevertiad any patience with the babies. Instead of assisting plaintiff in the care of them, he would become very much enraged if they disturbed him in the least. When they cried it made him angry.- One night, Rome time after the birth of the young est child, the defendant had been scolding and abusing the plaintiff, who was in bed with the defendant and her said babe, rendering sleep impossible, the said child became restless and fretful and the plaintiff in the morning arose from the bed and commenced bathing and dressing the child. At this the defendant com menced talking very abusively and angrily to plaintiff and ordered her to take the child and leave the room. Plaintiff replied that she would as soon as she finished dressing him at that defendant jumped out of bed and began swearing in the most frantic manner and said, "I ought to kill you for not obeying at once. Leave the room immediately." Thereupon the plaintiff didleave the room of the defend ant, and made up her mind that thereafter she wonld occupy a separate room, where she could spend her nightB in peace and have a place to dress herself and children in safety. That on account of the oroeity of defend ant, the plaintiff was thus driven to a separate room and bed. That she left the bed of the defendant only when she was peremptorily or dered to do so by the defendant. That for montha and even years before doing so, she was in nightly fear that the defendant would do her great personal injury and possibly take her life. Plaintiff denies that at any time there were sus picions circumstances as averred in the answer or otherwise, relative to her character or con duct. That at the time mentioned in the com plaint, when he choked her, Bhe with empha sis denied to him that Bhe at any time or in any manner had been guilty of any impropriety, and on account of the said denial, the defendant grew furious and seized her as stated in the complaint. At the time mentioned in the complaint and answer when the occurrence took place relative to a glass of ale thrown in the face of plaintiff, the defendant avers that the family, with defendant, were at the ta ble, and the defendant was mad because the meal did not suit him, and was scolding and complaining of the plaintiff on account of the same in a manner so usual that no one paid any attention, and none but defendant said anything that the little son of the parties made some remark which was not noticed by defendant, and to which plaintiff replied in a laugh ing manner. This "irritated" the defendant beyond endurance, and he at once dashednot the remnants but a glass of ale into the face of plaintiff, and im mediately rushed upon her and knocked her to the floor, and kicked the chair onto her. Defendant's daughter then assisted her to get up, and he then drove plaintiff into a corner and commenced choking and kicking plaintiff, defendant's daughter all the time trying to pu 1 him away. Her brother, the de fendant's son, also attempted to assist, but was or dered to let him alone, which ne did, on the threat by defendant that he wonld turn him out and never do anything for him, if he did not obey him At last, with the assistance of defendant's daughter, plaintiff reached the hall door to leave the room, where defendant kicked her into said ball. That at the time when defendant alleges in his an swerhe took a scanty breakfast, and as he was start ing down town in the morning, the plaintiff informed him that as she was without sufficient help and it was verywarm, and they were tired, shewould like to have him, for that day, take his dinner down town, and the family would lunch at dinnertime, and she would have supper at six. Defendant did not an swer, but aslie did not come home at noon, she took it for granted he had his dinner down town, and at the time appointed the plaintiff pre pared sapper. When defendant came home he en tered the dining room, and seeing the table spread and every thing on it for supper, without saying a word, made a rush at plaintiff, seized her by the hair and comroenoed shaking her by it, and exclaimed, "I'll see whether you can cook a dinner or not.",The daughter of defendant then told htm she would call some one in, and starting to do so, the defendant as saulted her and kicked her out of the front door- and told her to leave. He then went up stairs and out the fancy work of his said daughter's into shreds, at mentioned in the complaint. About onemonth previous to this last mentioned occurence, the defendant oame home at 8 o'clock at night, and not flndjng a hot dinner, which had been ready and served at noon, bat finding instead the usual supper spread on the table, in a great rage he kioked the table over, smashing crockery, glassware and nearly every thing on the table. The plaintiff avers that she has ever been economi cal, industrious and faithful In the discharge of her domeetio duties that on the contrary the defendant has been extravagant, exacting, Improvident and reckless in tile expenditure of money to gratify him self and for himself, and cold, calculating and pe nurious In the expenditure of money for his fam ily. That as to what is the actual income of the defend ant, plaintiff is uninformed aud has no means of proving doOnitely, but plaintiff avers on Information and belief the the same exceeds the sum of one thousand dollars per year. The plaintiff denies that the defendant has made expenditures beyond his Income to gratify or pro vide for her or his family, and avers that the ex penses have been chiefly for and Upon himself. The plaintiff denies tbat the defendant Is a fit per son to have the care or custody of the said children She avers that his manner of life at home is inimical to their morals and their happiness That daring the latter years that plaintiff lived with him, the de fendant would invite his boon and convivial compan ions to his home, sometimes Bix or eight at a time, and with them drink, carouse and play at cards till midnight, when the plaintiff would he required to cook and prepare for those gentlemen, to some of whom she had not even been introduced, a warm supper, in doing which she had no other aid than that of a nurse girl, and when at the hour of mid night they had partaken of supper, these worthy companions and guests of the defendant would re sume their wine and their cards, where they Would remain playing and, as plaintiff believes, gambling till daylight, when the defendant would go to bed. That on the occasion of these orgies the son of de fendant was required to act as waiter in bringing wine and such other drinks as were adapted to the lut-ts of these guests, and would witness their trans actions, while at times he would drink thewine from the glass they had leftunemptied. The plaintiff admits the averments in the answer that the defendant is "possessed of an impulsive na ture and a hasty temper," and she aversthat in addj ti to those qualities, he is inordinately selfish and domineering, and to gratify his appetite and desires would utterly disregard the feelings and comfort of the plaintiff, and require of her the submission of a slave rather than the devotion and love of a wife. The plaintiff denies that she is calculating, secretive or scheming, but she admits that in all her sufferings at the hands of the defendant, she has tried to over* come hei sense of resentment to keep cool and make use of that intelligence she had to so conduct her self tbat her domestic griefs and personal fears would not break up the family and cons'gn her chil dren to the possibility of a separation from her in case of a separation from her husband.* Plaintiff admits that she abandoned defend nt's home daring his absence, and avers that her personal fear of defendant led her to do so, as she would no dared to have left hadhe been at home. The defendant admits that her brother Hilford Harmon is indebted to her, but she avers that her cause of action against him aoorued more than six y-ar ago, and that the said Harmon is insolvent and the said demand cannot be collected. The plaintiff denies eaoh and every allegation in the answer that is not contained in the complaint nor herein admitted or specifically qualified In this re ply Wherefore the plaintiff demands Judgment as prayed for lu the complaint.

Weller. The history of this disgustingly unique case, and the sensa tional developments of the recent trial are al ready so well known to the pnbho as to not re quire repetition, as by referenoe to the decis ion it will be seen that the allegations of the plaintiff respecting the unheard of conduot of defendant are denied as beyond the range of probability, and he Btands vindicated before the public.

ROCHESTER Mr. H. Helverson, who owns a farm in the town of Vernon, Dodge county, while seated at the supper table had his door thrown open and a tab, red whis kered man In Irish brogue demanded bis money or his life at the point of a revolver. Mr. thinking that discretion was the best way out of the scrape, handed him bis wallet, which the robber opened and counted out the money, throwing down the pocket book, (he did lotbythe way get a large sum.) He then ran eft" in the darkness. Later in the evening, at about 9 o'clock, at a point four miles west, the same man entered a farm house of a Norwegian woman and demanded money. She pretended not to understand him. He began ransacking the house. After a familiar searoh of twenty minutes, he went to the stable for a horse, but from some cause was frightened and tooktothefields.Saturday night as S. Strangerland and K. Newson were returning home, whennearthe farm of J. Neville, in the town 0/ Bo cheater, two men approached them, one stopping the horses, the other came to the left aide of the wagon, and pointing a pistol at Newson fired. Stangeland, who carried a small revolver inside his mitten, fired through it at the robber, atd it is thought he hit him in the arm, as it dropped to his side. The one at the horses' heads hearing the cry of his confeder ate, came to his aid, and three shots were exchanged in rapid anrcession. This all happened in about two minutes, and in a turn in the road. As the last shot was fired, the would-be robbers took to the woods. The horses started off, and were soon away from the scene of so much reckless shooting. This highway robbery Is making bastnem for our hard ware merchants, as no one feels safe without carry ing a revolver if happening to be in the country late at night. ___ WINONA.

The Deliberat'ons of the Convention of Cane GrowersThe Early Amber Recom mended for Northern GrowthElection of Officers. ST. LOUIS, Deo. 3.The first annual conven tion of the Mississippi valley cane growers as sociation met here at the Polyteohnio tynlding this morning with a very fair attendance from the Western States. In the absenoe of John Walker, of Missouri, the president of the asso ciation, F. Miller, of Minnesota, was called to the ohair. Isaac Hodges, corres ponding secretary, read a lengthy report in whioh he stated that Bince the organization of the association last spring he has been in corre spondence with persons in twenty five States and Territories, regarding the cul ture of sorghum cane and the manufacture of sugar therefrom. He finds very great interest being taken in this matter throughout the oountiy, especially in the North, and much at tention is being given to the manufacture of sugar. The report is quite interesting, and contains many suggestions and mnoh informa tion of value to those interested in the pro motion and growth of this new industry. A report from Prof. Stewart, of Murphys ville, la., was read, which cited successful cases of crystallizing sugar from sorghum and Indian corn by the use of bis process. He said the Chinese or Asiatic cane was the best sugar pro ducing variety in the country. It can be grown wherever corn is raised. We had ob tained from Indian corn from 1,630 to 2,400 pounds of sugar to the acre. A discussion of the paper revealed the fact that several mem bers had obtained very different results from the use of Prof. Stewart's process, and that this process is by no means the only one by which sugar can be produced from sorghum cane. At the afternoon session the following of ficers were elected: President, Isaac N. Hodges, St. Louis vice presidents, M. G. Leonard, Illi nois O. T. Miller, Minnesota Thos. McLinstou, Ohio Jas. Colgate, Indiana Norman Oohmer, Missouri E. 8. Jones, Tennessee secretary, S. Jones, Pulaski, Tennessee treasurer, E. W. Douglass, St. Louis corresponding secre tary and expert, Geo. O. W. Belcher, St. Louis. Several letters from members unable to attend the convention, giving their experience in grow ing cane and making sugar and syrup, were read. The discussion of seeds, variety and culture, then came upin the regular order of business, and a number of members gave their experience. C. F. Miller, of Tennessee, thought the Minnesota grown seed preferable to that climate, the cane from it being earlier than cane raised in more southern sections. South ern-grown seed produces a large cane and more syrup, but the cane does not, an a rule, ma ture early enough for the extreme Northern climate. The weight of testimony seems to be in favor of the early amber variety, but Hon duras, early orange, Liberian, and one or two other varietiea were well spoken of. There is muoh enthusiasm among cane growers, and some will not only have stopped importing sugar, bnt will export large quantities.' Beduclionln Telegraphic Rates. NEW

AMUSEMENTS. MBTOOPOLITAN IHEATEB. The managers of the Metropolitan theater delight ed their numerous patrons last night with the grand play entitled "Rose Michel." The play is after the style of the "Two Orphans'' and "Celebra'ed Case,'' and is mounted with the same care and is co-turned in rich and appropriate dress. The play brings out near every member of the company, 6overal of them having strong characters to sustain. The lead ing roles gave the fine talent in the company an opportunity to be seen at its best. Manager John Murray assumes the character of Fierre Michel, and, as might be expeoted, presents a finished piece of acting that is liberally ap\ lauded. Mr. Bryton as Henri, Count de Varnay, and Grace Cartiand as Bose Michel,did some effective actinc. and the cast throughout was all that could be asked This play that has proven such a favoiite in the East bids fair to draw immense houses during its run. TSEATJBB COMlQtTE. "Leadville or Bust" continues to draw like a poor man's plaster, and the crowds at the Comique laugh themselves sore at the laughable incidents presented as a portrayal of life in the West. Charlie Mason as Chalky White, tha negro, does some iunny things that are highly appreciated, judging from the loud and frequent outbursts of appl use aiid laughter heard nightly. Mr. Shepard has improved on his Hildebrand, and presents a finished representation of the border lufflau. The other characters are well sustained, and the play is to run during the remain der of the week. In the variety port on of the en tertainment some excellent features are introduced. Oznola continues her trapeze acta, the Barrett broth -ers sing the '"Lackawanna Hpooners," the "Hod Car riers," etc. Charlie Mason does excellent Dutch acts Delia and John Shepard have a new Irish sketch Little Etolia does a clever eong and dance act, and Miss Alice Gifford, the handsome serio comic binger, captivates the throng with her flirta tion songs.
