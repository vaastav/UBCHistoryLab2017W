The more important price movements in cotton today were due to statistics and they gave the market a very steady undertone, but without, how ever, arousing any very great buying power. Ginning returns to the first of December of 9,138,144 bales just about met expectations on the long side; mill takings for the week of 437,000 bales, against 383,000, this week last year, were altogether larg er than expected and sent the market to its highest levels, 24.57 cents a pound for January and to net gains on the list of 15 to 23 points. Small recessions occurred In the late ses sion, under realizing on the long side, and the market closed at net gains of 11 to 15 points, with the January pos ition at 24.47. Better cables than due helped to cause a higher opening. During the first call, the ginning figures were (ne) of section seventeen (17). town ship four (4) north of range thirty-two (32) west, containing forty (40) acres more or less, together with the tene ments, hereditaments, and appurten ances thereunto belonging, or pertain ing, the whole free from all exemption or right of homestead. Deed at cost of purchaser. F. R. ANDERSON. Special Master their effect was almost completely offset by the efforts of traders on the long side to take profits on the hard spot they felt would be created. First gains amounted to one to 14 points, near months being much an extent that the market was forced to declines under yesterday's close of 18 to 20 points, January dropping to 24.16. For a while the market remained depressed and trading became light but the weekly statistics caused a new period of activity and strength which lasted until longs went to realizing again in too large a way. The market seemed to be steaedier in the after noon by the decrease of 20,689 bales for the week in the visible supply of American cotton, the first decrease since the crop movement became heavy. New York Cotton NEW YOKK, Dec. 8. Slightly larger ginning figures than expected caused some liquidation at the open ing of the cotton markettoday. The offerings wrre absorbed on a compar aively moderate decline, however, and rallies followed which carried prices into new" high ground for the movement. January contracts sold up from 24.51 to 24.87 and closed at 24.'78 with the general market closing steady at a net advance of 10 to 15 po.ints. LIVERPOOL COTTON LIVERPOOL. Dec. 8.
