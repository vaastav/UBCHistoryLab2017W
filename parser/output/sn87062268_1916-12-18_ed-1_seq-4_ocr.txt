The immediacy of response to a sug gestion contained in these columns yester day, with a mass meeting called for Wed nesday night to determine on the new high school building, shows how accurately Tm? Journal interpreted public opinion and its demands in this important direction. As is announced elsewhere in this issue, the meeting will be held at the city hall. "and will be called to order at half past seven bv Mrs. D. Kugleman, president of the Parents and Teachers' bqciety. City officials, educators, and the citizen ship generally will thus be enabled to take council together and determine their course in what promises to be one of the most democratic appeals to popular government in the history of Pensacola. To Professor Rogers, principal of the school; to R. Pope Reese, and the other members of the investigating committee; 'to Superintendent of Education Edwards, and to Mayor Hinrichs, the thanks of the community are especially due for their zeal in arranging the details of the meeting; nor should reference be omitted to the Parents and Teachers' Society, the Rotary club, and the numerous private lndivduals whose interest has helped crystahze sen timent. , The future is now in the hands of the people of Pensacola. 

MARK TWAIN AND THE KAISER. Professor Alphonso Smith, Roosevelt ex change professor at the University of Berlin m 1911, describing an interview with the kaiser, says: "He reads Mark Twain, or has read to him, and he ? enjoys him, but he said that when he met Mark Twain, it was only with the greatest difficulty that he could get him to talk at all. Commenting on which the. Montgomery Advertiser is mildly shocked to learn that the great philosopher should have been abashed in the presence of royalty. Mark Twain tells how, at the beginning of his career, when he was introduced' to General Grant, he said. "General I'm em barrassed are you?" And years later, when the author, famous then, was introduced ,to President Grant, the latter opened the con versation with, "I'm not at all embarrassed are you?" , Mark Twain mentions Prince Edwardr the Empress of Austria,, and some royalty of more or lesser light, but always in a sat irical sense; but unless our memory plays us false, he never, in any of his writings or speeches alludes to the kaiser. In an author so subjective, is not this significant? Does THE

COST OF GARBAGE DISPOSAL. Statistics gathered' from thirty-six cities, ranging from 10,000 to 465,000 in popula tion, show that Pensacola's system of. garbage collection and disposal compares very favorably, in cost, with that of the most modern centers of the United States. Strangely enough, the highest and lowest costs are found in Ohio. The garbage bill of Canton is $1.38 a year per capita; while in Dayton it is only fifteen cents. Altoona, Penn., 52,000 inhabitants, spends $42,600 a year on the collection and disposal of garbage, a per capita cost of 82 cents; Charleston, S. C, 58,000, $4,00Q or 17 cents; Richmond, Ind., 22,000, $7,200. or 32 cents ; Zanesville, Ohio, 28,000, $6,500, 'or 23 cents. Dayton, with a population of 116,000, spends $53,000, but receives a - vearlv revenue of 30.000 to 40 000 from , . , - T J T 1 ' the reduction plant, which explains its low "pir capita cost .'" ' : Ii Pensacola the cost of collecting garbage amounts to $500 a month, or $6,000 a year,nd is contracted to private enter prise. Incineration, however, is at the city's t expense, but the wages of the two foremen and their assistants, together with the de preciation on the plant and the interest on the investment, will hardly bring the total cost up to $8,000, which will mean a per capita cost of about 30 cents. If the cost is to be lowered further, some such plan as Dayton's reduction method must be adopted. Cities throughout the country are turning their waste into profit- aDie industries. Jfaper, rags and metal have a high value, and other substances, in stead of being destroyed, are turned into fertilizer. Talk about evolution, the gray alley cat, after giving up its ninth life, is evolved into choice "mole skin" on Mme. Fashion's daintv gown.

This would be an excellent opportunity tor a little homily on democracy vs. king ship, but as matter of fact, Mark Twain, though democratic to the degree of going into the parlor, when his wife had company, without his collar on, and jionest enough to send it to the lady's house afterwards with a polite little note calling attention to the fact that he really did possess such an article of raiment, was not averse to kings. Quite the contrary, he has paid the greatest compliment in all literature to a king King Arthur.

In all the range of literature there istno nobler pass age; and the Arthur of the'smallpox hut is ten thousand times nobler than the autom aton that he is commonly depicted on the battlefield. Mark Twain wasn't embarrassed by the kaiser. The nearest he ever came to being embarrassed was when he first met General Grant if you would call it embarrassment. But Mark Twain was interested in men- whether king or beggar; convention and ar ficiality he abhorred, as narrowing to the soul, whether in prince or pauper. The kaiser, prototype of the Divine Right idea, typified everything humanly useless to Mark 1 wain and that s the reason why he 'a i. - 1 wdiu t mtcrcbicu in mm. OUCH. THE Fillll DAIRY By C. K.

Immediately after b ing. drawn the milk should be strained and put in shallow pans to cool quick ly. This applies to conditions where a milk cooler cannot be used. Where no separator is available it is neces sary to cool the milk aa soon as pos sible to enable the t cream to rise. Where five or more cows are milked it Is advisable to invest In a mm separator, becaus running the milk through a separator Immediately aftr mllking Is the best way known for getting absolutely clean rrUk, -t ,'en If the whole milk is to be used. The. cream and skimmed milk from the separator can be mixed after the sep arating, and the milk that has un dergone this process is a good .deal cleaner than where the farmer simply follows ordinary methods. The action of the separator cleans the milk of al! the slimy and undesirable contents which attach themselves to the inside of the bowl and can be easily removed when cleaning it. Where a certain amount of cream is reserved for churning, the remaining crvam and skimmed milk can be reunited and used on the table. COOLING THE MILK. It Is desirable, where possible, t cool the milk immediately after milk ing.. A temperature of fifty degrees Is desirable for several reasons. The bacteria present in the milk will not multiply so readily as in high temper ature, and an increase in bacterial number will sour the milk rapidly. We can readily see that quick cooling and the maintaining of a low temper ature will prevent or at least delay sourins for a considerable time. A
