Pope, 42 Ferrar Road, Streat ham, England, said: "Yes, poor chap, he is gone, dead horse bolted, thrown off his seat on his cab he was driving and killed poor chap, and a good sort, too. mate It was him, you see. who gave me th: hair-bottle of St. Jacob3 Oil tha made a new man of me. 'Twas lik this: me and Bowman were grea friends. Some gentleman had give? him a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil whicl had done him a lot of good; he onlj used half the bottle, and remembering that I had been a martyr to rh?uma tism and sciatica for years, that I har literally tried everything, had doctors and all without benefit, I became dls couraged, and looked upon it tha there was no help for me. Well," said Pope, "You may not believe me, foi it is a miracle, but before I had used the contents of the half-bottk of St. Jacobs Oil which poor Bowman gave me, I was a well man. There it is, you see. after years of pain, aftei using remedies, oils, embrocations, horse liniments, and spent money or: doctors without getting any better, was completely cured in a few day". I bought another bottle, thinking th. pain might come back, but it did not, so I gave the bottle away to a friend who had a lame back. I can't speak too highly of this wonderful pain killer."

"We now have seventeen battleships ap propriated for, of which nine are completed and have been commissioned lor actual serv ice. The remaining eight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who know how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled under a thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while the. recruit ing must be carried on with still greater vigor. "The naval militia forces are state organl ations. and are trained for coast service, and In event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense. They should receive hearty encouragement from the general government. "But in addition we should at once pro Tide for a National Naval Reserve, organized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, and subject to the call of the Chief Kxecutlve whenever war becomes immi nent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace establishment, and of fer material to be drawn on at once for manning our skips in time of war. It should be composed o graduates of the Naval Acad emy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels and steam yachts, together with the coast population about such centers as life-saving stations and light houses. Need for Powerful Navy. "The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to arcept a sec ondary position in international aflairs, not merely in political, but in commercial, mat ters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting national disaster than to be 'opulent, aggressive, and unarmed.' "It is not necessary to increase our army beyond its present Eize at this time. But it Is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency. "Every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly increasing state of ef ficiency. When on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such service should be required. The paper work in the army, as in the navy, should be greatly re duced. What is needed is proved power of command and capacity to work well in the field. Constant care Is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commis sary departments. "The Congress should provide means where by it will be possible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars, and if possible also a division of national guards men, once a year. "Only actual handling and providing for men in masses while they are marching, camping, embarking, and disembarking, will It be possible to train the hiaher officers to perform their duties well and smoothly. "A great debt is owing from, the public to the men of the army and navy. They should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency, so that they may be able to respond instantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of the nation and the honor of the flag. The Individual American enlisted man is prob ably on the whole a racre formidable Usa'.lut, man than the regular of any other army Every consideration should be shown him and in return the highest standard of use fulness should be exacted from him. It is well worth while for the Congress to con sider whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the in creased value of the veteran soldier. Militia Laws Obsolete. "Action should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising of volunteer forces. Our militia law is obsolete and worthless. The organization and armament of the Na tional Guard of the several states, which are treated as militia in t'ae appropriations by the Congress, should be made identical with those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should be carefully denned, and a system established by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance. It Is utterly impossible in the excitement and baste of impending war to do tnis satisfac torily if the arrangements have not been made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer or ganizations called cut the training of those citizens who have already had experience un- ider arms, and especially for the selection In 'advance of the officers of any force which may be raised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the out break of war. "That the army Is not at all a mere in strument of destruction has been shown dur ing the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba and Porto Rico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent im plement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civ ilization. Kulog-y or Veterans. "No other citizens deserve so well of the republic as the veterans, the survivors of those who saved the union. They did the one deed which if left undone would have meant that all else in our history went for nothing. But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history, all our annals would be meaningless, and our great experiment in popular freedom and self-gov ernment a gloomy failure. Moreover, they not only left us a united nation, but they left us also as a heritage the memory of the mighty deeds by which the nation was kept united. We are now indeed one nation, on In fact as well as in name; we are united In our devotion to the flag which is the sym bol of all national greatness and unity; and the very completeness of our union enables us all, in every part of the country, to glory In the valor shown alike by the sons of the North and the sons of the South in the times that tried men's souls. Merit System Endorsed. "The merit system of making appointments Is In its essence as democratic and American as the common schools system itself. It sim ply means that In clerical and other positions where the duties are entirely non-political, all applicants should have a fair field and no favor, each standing on his merits as he Is able to show them by practical test. Writ ten competitive examinations offer the only available means in many cases for applying this system. In other cases, as where la borers are employed, a system of reeistra tlon undoubtedly can be widely extended. There are, of course, places where the writ ten competitive examination cannot be ap plied, and others where it offers by no means an ideal solution, but where under existing political conditions it is, though ail imperfect means, yet the best present meaus of get ting satisfactory results. "It is Important to have this system ob tain at home, but it is even more important to have it applied rigidly in our insular pos sessions. The administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the suspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philippines or Porto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he makes that coun try's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under it. This is all that we should ask, and we cannot afford to be content with less." Treatment of Indians The message points out the defects In our present consular service, and recommends the passage of bills now before Congress that will increase its efficiency. Of tha Indian problem it says- "In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass. It acts direct ly upon the family of the individual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States. We should now break up the tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands; that is. they should be divided into individual holdings. A step should be put upon the indiscriminate per mission to Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the .Indian work like any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should be made the same as those of the whites. "In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from the liquor traf flc We are doing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by International agreement this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort should b made to bring it about. "I bespeak the most cordial support from the Congress and the people for the St Louis Exposition to Commemorate the One Hun dredth Anniversary of the Louisiana Pur chase. This purchase was the greatest in stance of expansion in our history. It def initely decided that we were to become a great continental republic, by far the fore most power in the Western Hemisphere. The national government should be represented at the exposition by a full and complete set of exhibits. "The people of Charleston, with great en ergy and civic spirit, are carrying on an ex position which will jontinue throughout most 'of the present session of the Congress. I heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all the en couragement that can be given it. "For the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement of science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent government bureau. This (would insure better, cheaper and more sat isfactory work. In the interest not only of ur business but of statistic, economic and aocial science. The remarkable growth ot tha postal ser vice la shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and its expenditures have near ly doubled within twelve years. Its progres sive development compels constantly increas ing nutiav. but in this period of business en ergy and prosperity Its receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual de ficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411. 779 In 1S97 to J3.923.727 in 1901. Among recent postal advances the success ot rum ireo delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for Its ex tension is general and urgent. Growth of Postal Service. Tr is lust that the m-eat agricultural popu lation should share in the improvement of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation is 6,009, practically all established within three years, and there are 6.000 appli cations awaiting action. It is expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The mail will then be daily carried to the doors ot F. 700,000 of our people who bave heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, and one third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered by this Jtina of service. Second-Class Mail Matter. The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well-understood abuses which have grown up In connection with second class mail matter. The extent of this burden ap pears when It is stated that while the second-class matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, it paid lor tne last fiscal year only $1,294,445 of the aggre gate postal revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose of encour aging the dissemination of public informa tion, were limited to the legitimate news papers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy de liberately adopted for a justifiable end. But much of the matter which en.ioys the privi leged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law. and has secured admission only through an evasion of its requirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whola volume of second-class mail. If it be only one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude of the burden is apparent. The Postoffice De partment has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter ap plication of the law; and it should be sus tained in it3 effort." "We view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the procedings of the Pan-American Congress, convoked at the invitation of Mexico, and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of the United States are under the most liberal instructions to co operate with their colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great family of American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves as ia their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with the world at large. The occurrences arising from the "Boxer" outbreak in China are reviewed in detail, and the steps taken to secure to the United States its share of the trade of the Orient are ex iilained. The message concludes: "The death of Queen Victoria caused the people of the United States deep and heart felt sorrow, to which the government gave full expression. When President McKinley died, our nation in turn received from every quarter of the British empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Goiinany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the President was assassinated. Indeed, from, every quarter of the civilized world we re ceived, at the time of the President's death,' assurances of such grief and regard as to' touch the hearts of our people. In the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the Al mighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind; and we firmly intend that our policy skall be such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual re spect and good will. 

THEODORE ROOSEVELT. White House. December 3, 190L Girls Whip a Psather. Anna Carter and Myrtle Love, liv ing near Grant's pass, Oregon, not long ago fought and whipped a panther, though neither of the girls had a wea pon more deadly than a good-size-" rock. The girls are nieces of Jud Hanna, who owns a large farm, and were engaged in washing clothes at a creek not far from the house, when one of them saw a large panther crouching within twenty feet of them. The big brute was evidently getting ready to spring at them. Miss Carter, who first caught sight of the animal, had an armful of clothes. These she flung at the panther just as he rose in the air. The brute became entangled in a sheet and before it could claw itself free the girls had poured in on his ribs and head a shower of rocks which they had picked up. The unexpected attack completely rattled the panther, which darted away with a snarling cry. Then the girls ran to the house and sent a couple of armed men after the prowler. That evening a handsome panther skin was nailed on the side of the barn. Mot Up in Geography. A certain minister of Greater New York is determined that his young daughter shall not know the dark side of orthodox religion. The miss went to the country with her mother during the past summer, and there found a playmate in the youthful daughter of a village teacher. One day the follow ing conversation was overheard: "You've told a story," said the village girl, accusingly. "Don't you know where folks go that tell stories?" "No," replied the New York miss. "Where do they go?" "They go to hell," "Where's hell?" "Why, Mamie Blank, you a minister's daughter and don't know where hell is!"- "Well, I don't care," answered the accused. "I never was in a geography class in my life." New York Times. Juvenile Discrimination. A little Germantown (Pa.) boy, who goes to Sunday school every Sunday, always receives a nickel from hi3 father to place in the collection plate. Last Sunday his father gave him two nickels, saying: "One is for the Lord and the other is for yourself." As it was too early to start for Sunday school, the little boy sat on the porch steps in the warm sunshine, playing with the two nickels. After a while he dropped one of them and it disap peared down a crack. Without a mo ment's hesitation and still clutching the remaining coin in his clenched fist, he looked up at his father, exclaiming:' "Oh, pop! there goes the Lord's nick el!" Philadelphia Record.

Stray Stories. 1 MESSAGE IH LONI The Mirrors of Public Opinion There Have Only Praise. ALL PAPERS SUMMARIZE IT.: London, Dec 5. Practically all the morning papers publish a long- sum mary of President Roosevelt's message to Congress. The Daily News, in an editorial on the subject says: "It shows a bold man straggling with the devil-fish of party intrigne and is in refreshing contrast to the, spread-eagleism of the early period of American jingoism. President Roose velt has set himself a very high, ideal of conduct in public life, and we have no doubt he will rise to it." The Pall Mall Gazette says that the ideas contained in it are those of a "wise head firmly set on its shoulders.'" The Pall Mall Gazette highly ap proves of the president's suggestions relative to repressive measures to pre vent, as the paper puts it, "America from becoming the dumping ground of the block-heads and starvelings of Eu rope." The St. James Gazette says it is grat ifying to find that the statesmen of a country like the United States are not afraid to make proposals on the sub ject of anarchism, which, on the sur face, are open to the criticism that they are subversive of personal liberty. There is no surer sign of true states manship than the insight which real izes when a good theory becomes mis chievous, in practice. "President Roosevelt's first message," said Lord Rothschild, "certainly seeuns statesmanlike and should produce a good effect in England and the rest of Europe, where its careful, friendly ref erences to the other powers will be much appreciated." The Daily Telegraph thinks that President Roosevelt's policy is calcula ted rather to diminish than to increase Europe's exaggerated dread of "the American danger." The Daily Chronicle considers his .cautious and tentative proposals con- perning trusts to show that the office of president has a sobering effect even on the most buovant of natures. Indian Territory Towns. Washington, Dec. 7. Mr. Stephens of Texas has introdoced in the house a bill providing that any incorporated ;ity or town in the Indian territory having a population of 1,000 or more, may issue bonds and borrow money thereon, to be used for the construction Df sewers and water works and the building of school houses, such bonds not to exceed in amount the interest on which at 5 per centum per annum would be liquidated by a tax of five mills upon the dollar of the valuation of the taxable property in such city or town, to be ascertained by the last i assessment for purposes of taxation. JJefore the bonds shall be issued they are to be authorized by a two-thirds majority vote of the qualified voters of the city or town voting at an election. The President on Anarchy. Washington, Dec. 7. The president's' message discusses anarchy at some length. His paragraph concerning anarchy opens with this: "The An archists, and especially the anarchist in the United States, is merely one type of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents the same depravity in a greater degree. The man who advocates Anarchy directly or indirectly, in any shape or fashion, or the man who apologizes for Anarchists and their deeds, makes himself morally accessory to murder before the fact." Roosevelt on Liquor Traffic. .Washington, Dec. 7. President Roosevelt's message has this para graph: "In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degredation result ing from the liquor traffic. We are do ing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever by in ternational agreement this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about." German labor Bureau. Berlin, Dec. 3. The anti-Chamberlain excitement is subsiding. The students of Erlangen and Strassberg declined to take action in a demonstra tion against the British colonial secre tary, taking the ground that his utterances were not important enough to injure the German army. The government has decided to es tablish a bureau of labor statistics, apparently similar to the one at Wash ington. Active Times In Philippines. Manila, Dec 7. Advices from Catba logan, capital of the island of Samar, report that the insurgent, Gen. Lukban, has offered to negotiate terms of sur render with Gen. Smith. To this offi cer the American commander replied that the time for negotiations, had passed. The gunboat Frolic during November, destroyed 147 boats engaged in smug gling supplies to the insurgents. All male Filipinos have been ordered to leave the coast towns. Fly nn's Statehood Bill. Washington, Dec 5. Delegate Flynn of Oklahoma says that he is more than confident . that the house of repre sentatives would pass the bill admitting Oklahoma as a state. Mr. Flynn has introduced the statehood bill. The bill has the support of Mr. Knox, of Massa chusetts, the chairman of the commit tee on territories. Mr. Flynn is gratified with the expressed sentiments of other members of the committee. Bills for admitting New Mexico and Arizona were also introduced. Xee Chop's Fortune. "With, a fortune of $150,000, Lee Cnop, a Chinese merchant of New York, la going back to Canton.

At 5 years of age boys are mainly taller than girls, but at 7 years the girls catch up and either outstrip the boys or hold their own until 9, after which the boys take a fresh start ana maintain a good lead for two years. At about 12 years the girls suddenly become taller than the boys, continu ing so until their fifteenth year, waen the boys finally regain their superior ity In stature and hold it permanently. Marconi of Irish Descent. Few people are aware that Sign or Marconi, who is soon about to get married, is the son of an Irish lady, the daughter of Mr. Andrew Jameson, who had a famous distillery near Em niscorthy, which ceaoed operations in 1840. Of his two daughters, one mar ried Mr. A. S. Davis, and the other became the wife of Signor Marconi, whose son is the present world-famed hero of wireless telegraphy fame. Remarkable Stack of Wheat. There is a remarkable wheat stack on a farm near StradDroke, England. It was built in 1873 and the owner made a vow that he would never thrash it until it realized 5 a sack, a price which has never been offered. The stack stands on an iron support, two feet from the ground and Is In an excellent state of preservation. It Is estimated that the stack contains 250 bushel The Tung's Mistake, "Hand3 up!" sternly commanded the footpad as he stepped before a hurry ing pedestrian in a lonely suburb and thrust a revolver muzzle in his face. The pedestrian halted long enough to snatch the pistol from the robber and knock him down with one fell blow. "How dare you try to make me miss a strl car when they pass only once an I hour!" exclaimed the pedestrian an grily. Then he hurried on in th j dark ness. Ohio State Journal. B. Washington Entertained President. It is now remembered that in De cember, 1S93, the President of the United States and the governor ot Alabama were entertained socially at Tuskegee, Ala., by Mr. and Mrs. Book er T. Washington. The New Orleans Picayune said at the time: "No white hosts or hostesses could have been more courteous in attending to and more thoughtful in forestalling every want of their guests than were these refined and educated Africans. Napoleon Turned Pale. In a recent magazine article Anton von Werner speaks of his famous painting, representing the meeting of Bismarck and Napoleon on the Chaus see de Donchery. Bismarck described the scene to him minutely, mentioning among other things one amusing de tail: "I stopped my horse to get off. My revolver accidentally got between my legs and hindered me in dismount ing. I seized it, and seeing this the (Napoleon) turned pale as chalk." Sinking of a Railroad Bed. A novel condition of railroad engi neering was presented recently by the sinking of the roadbed on the Monon railway, in Lake county, Illinois. About S00 feet of bed settled, and in a little over two months the depression had reached an estimated depth of 100 feet. For months the company has been filling the hole, over 7,500 carloads of rubble and timber having been dumped in it. The bottom seems to have been reached. Exhaustion of natural gas is said to have caused the phenome non. A Clergy man's Discovery. Fredericksburg, Ind., Dec 2. Ac cording to the positive declaration of Rev. E. P, Stevens of this place, that gentleman has found a remedy for all diseases of the kidneys and urinary organs. For years he suffered severely with these complaints, incontinence of the urine, making life a burden to him, but he never ceased experimenting In the hope that some day he would dis cover a remedy. After many failures he has at last succeeded and is today perfectly cured and a well man, and explains that his recovery is due to the nse of Dodd's Kidney Pills. This rem edy has been successfully applied to many cases of Lama Back, Rheuma tism, Bright's Disease, Diabetes and other Kidney Diseases and there seems t- be no case of the kind that Dodd's Kidney Pilla will not cure. This Is the only remedy that has ever cured Bright's Diseasr Llkei the Public Schools. President Alderman of Tulane uni versity, New Orleans, said in an ad dress at a recent convention in the Crescent city of the Louisiana parish, superintendents of public schools: "If I had as many sons as Priam of Troy, though I should be worth millions of money, I would educate every one ot cay boys in the public schools."

The much-talked-of Chinese astro nomical instruments brought from Pe kin and now in the possession of Ger many have been proved to be the work of a German named Gogeissl, who died In 1771. He was attached to the court at Pekin - and was president of the royal observatory. Problem for Agricultural Department. The dragon-fly is the natural enemy of the mosquito. The Department of Agriculture ha3 discovered that tho English sparrow, among its other of fensive traits. Is fond of young dragon fiies, called "nymphs." When these emerge from the water and come out with wings, the sparrows catch them by the thousand and destroy them. This, it Is believed, results in a greater prevalence of mosquitoes. Every man thinks he is more im portant than his neighbor. Prudes are females who are always looking for temptations to resist. Are Ton Tired and Faered Out? If so use
