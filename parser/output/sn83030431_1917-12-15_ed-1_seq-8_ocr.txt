TELEPHONE. UEEKMAN SMO. The Kesponslblllty for Unprepared ness. Tho neglect of preparation for wnr goes bjck further than nny conflict of responsibility on which the state ments of either General Cuor.ir.B or Secretary Uakkb can throw much light. It goes buck to n state of mind ln the White House which was ac curately Indicated ln these remarks in the message of President Wood bow Wilson to the Congress on De cember 8, 1014, four months attcr the world war had begun: "It Is said In soma quarters that wo are not prepared for war. What Is neant by being prepared? Is It meant that we are not ready upon brief no tice to put a nation In tho neld. a na tion of men trained to arms? Of course we are not roJdy to do that; and wo aever shall bo in tlmo of peace so long aa we retain our present political prin ciples and institutions. And what Is it that it Is suggested we should bo pro pared to do? To defend ourselves against attack? Wo have always found leans to do that and k'.i.tII find them whenever it Is ncceKsary without calling our people' away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military ser vice In time cf peace." "We are at peace with all the world, lfo one who spcaks counsel based "on fact or drawn from a Just and candid Interpretation of' realities can sny that there Is reason to foar that from any quarter our Independence or the integ rity of our territory Is threatened. Dread of the power of any other nation we are Incapable of." , "The subject is not new. There is no new need to discuss It. We shall not alter our attitude toward it becnuo aome among us are nervous and ex cited." "Let thero be no misconception. The country has been misinformed. We havo not been negligent of national defence. Wt have not been unmindful of the great responsibilities resting vpon us." This stato of mind lasted long after tho date specified above. It labted long and operated disistrously. We are not bringing up the old. undeni able. Inescapable fact for the purpose of criticising President Wilson or re proaching him. He thought he was .right, but he was wrong. Mitny pa triotic Americans knew he was wrong at the very time when ho thought himself right. Theodore Roosevelt knew the President was wrong, nnd was accused of partisan politics nnd personal ambition for saying so plainly. Leonabd Wood knew it, and did what be could to prevent the dire consequences of the mistake. Lind ixt M. Garrison, 1a Mr. Wilson's own Cabinet, knew his chief was wrong, and Xcwton D. Bakes, who- did not know It then but knows It saw, sits In Gakrison's place. It Is profitless to, speculate about what might have resulted from an arller perception In the highest quar ters at Washington of that which Is now clearly perceived In every quar ter. The main fact for national con gratulation Is that when the great light came to the country, when the delusion of security that cvndcd'and postponed and procrastinated so long had given place to a universal recog nition of the urgent. Immediate need of preparations for wur and rt most energetic measures of preparedness, the President's own eyes were not blind or his head nnd hands Idle. Tho country had' not been mlsln , formed. We had been negligent of national defence. And It Is to Mr. Wilson's everlasting credit that what ever may have been his Ideas on tho subject In December of 1011, he Is foremost three years later In the prac tical If belated effort to make pre paredness complete.

ShonU Its Been nnd Light Wines Be Restored? j To tub Editor or Tub sun sir; Your ui""i arucio unuer mo iicauuin " , n,...(lnn SV,m. TmW It mow presslntr for solution than the can- ln Problem. A few years ago the Daughters of the American It'evolutlon begsn a campaign In congress to re- store to tho soldier bis canteen, but no definite results were obtained. Tho war AinJ!'t-2i..J!!f men but among those who genuinely sympathise with our soldiers. As U commonly known, the canteen was taken away from the American soldier at tho behest of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, a well meaning but misguided organisation of prohibitionists whose members wore able to terrify the members of Congress, who. more through cmvardlco than reason, voted to deny tho soldiers their mild mslt beers. Tho question of national prohibition In thl. country may be settled .In France. If the war lasts until the United States iber of men alonir the ipcr oi men along ino has a great number fighting front, certainty the liquor ques tion is going to bo noticeably affected by tho new experiences lo living the sol diers wilt take back with them to America, i With few exceptions American sol diers In France are dally drinking a cer tain amount of wlno nnd beer. Per haps tho most important reason for this Is that the drinking water ln tho greater number of tho camps haa been pro nounced unsanitary by tho medical au thorltles, and the men prefer the .light uihes to tho moro or lees distasteful sterilised water. Another reason Is that a etrangcr falls naturally Into the customs of the country In which lie becomes domiciled. On every side tho American soldier sees the French men and women and even children sipping of wlno with every meal. If ho eats In a French rcstau ant wlno or beer Is Invariably served to him. Oft duty, the little provincial cafe Is his lounging place and a Bias of wlno hla. customary refreshment.

Harold It. Peat, a young Canadian volunteer who went to France with the first contingent from this side, haa written a book giving his experiences of two yean. In tho trenches. Among other things he tclla how a "tot" of rum, about equal to a t.tMcspoonful, Li served out to each mnn tho flrst thing every winter morning. It Is not com pulsory, "but our commanders-and the irmy surgeons believe that rum an a medicine, as a stimulant. Is necessary to the' health of tho soldier." "Wo gulp It down ifhen half froxen and nearly paralyzed after standing a night In mud ind blood and ice often to thc waist line, and It rcvUcs Us as tea, cocoa or coffee could never do." As to the oppo sition, he says: The argumenla acalnat rum mnl-.o Mr. Tommy Atklna tlrtd, and I may r&y that I haio never yet seen a chaplain refute his ration. And of tho mlt of tho good Ood'a earth aro the chaplains. tf u man Is found drunk ihll on active service bo li liable, to court-martial an I death. A few- ears trjlnlr cf this kind will make tho biggest pre-war drunkard coma bavk home a al,er man. That '!. And It la good common sense. After three years experience, trei rmy surgeon know- that the moderate use of alcohol Is not only not harmful, but I- tli- one thing that will nil the need In tan extremn traercency. The abolition of the eoldler'w canteen,'1 in Iiah Wen proved by the wnr, say what one n 111 about cither temperance, prohibition or total abstinence, was a mistake. If the Daughters of the Vmerican devolution would sponsor a novement to restore tho canteen, l" am X -urc they would have the mor,il and material support of a large majority of thc people. Since all the warring Governments oincially sec to giving beer and wine and a "noggin" of rum to their soldiers, why should the United State smugly counte nance drinking for its soldiers nbrohd wtillo disapproving thc use of mild alcoholic beverages at home?

He was no' the man to follow thc line of least re sistance. Ho deliberately chose car! I In his career to lie true to himself am. his art, although lt meant years ' privation und sorrow. Millet onco wrote: "Alt Is not a 1 version. It l it confllit, n complli tion of wheels in which one Is citsftr I nm not a philosopher.
