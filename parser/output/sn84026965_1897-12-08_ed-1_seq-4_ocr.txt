The Republicans would rather skip - the coming session of Congress thara t$ hold it. If the Cubans can keep a supply of ammunition and rations on hand until next yellow fever season there will be no necessity for Uncle Sam's "good .Hees."_ ^ ^_* Hon. Patrick Walsh has been elected Mayor of Augusta, Ga. By bia election the citizens of Augusta hare done credit to themselves and honored a worthy citizen. The United States Supreme Court has set March 7th as the time for hearing the Dispensary case. The Legislature, therefore, will have to tackle* the qu?stion blindly. ?Newbold has been admitted to bail . in the sum of $2.500 by Judge Town - send at Union. The admitting to bail of men who shoot down innocent per sons is a most dangerous proceeding, and should not be allowed. Representative Livingston, of Georgia, who is one of the best friends Cuba has in Congress, doesn't think the outlook good for legislation favorable to Cuba. He thinks there will be a lot of talk but no action. Gen. Miles, commander-in-chief of the United States army, has broken ? loose again and is demanding an in crease of the army. With a modesty only equalled by his beanty, Gen. Miles suggests as a^tarter au increase about 100 per cent: in the armed forces of the United States. The Comptroller General's omce finds the total assessed value of the i ?eal estate* of the State to be $101, 872,706 this year, which is an increase of about a million dollars over last year's assessment. The personal ; property assessment rose over two million dollars in the same time. . Charleston will have her usual Gala Week this fall on a grander scale than ever. It will begin next Monday and ; last the entire week.. There will be , racing, reel contests, trades display, fantastic parade, shotgun contests, sham battle, concerts and amuse ments everywhere. The good people of the grand old city will extend a cordial welcome to all visitors. . A cali for a convention of cotton j growers, to be held in Memphis.^ De- j \ cember..20, has been issued by Mr. Hector D. Lane, , president of the American Cotton Growers' Protective Association. Mr. Lane thinks that the present low price of cotton, which ' is due in great part to the enormous crop, demands ? concert of action on the part of cotton growers to avert a . similar calamity next year. The first regular session of the . Fifty-fifth Congress convened Monday, .and it will probably remain in session for the next six or seven months. .President McKinley's message was a ?lengthy one. .The' currency question and foreign relations are tne chief matters discussed. He recommends (inaction as*tc Cuba and urges the annexation of the Haiwaian Islands. The following is an extract from a I private letter received from a promi- j aent ex-railroad man whose opinion in j railroad affairs is based upon years of experience and whose information con cerning the resources of the South is considerably in advance of most men with whom it is our pleasure to con verse or correspond: "I notice there is a threat on the part of the owners .of the Charleston and1 Western Caro lina Railroad to build a new road from Atlanta co Augusta, but this will not be done. There are already two roads between those*citics, and a third would never pay. It is not more short lines we need in the South, but a grand Trunk Line, such as the proposed Black Diamond, coming direct from centers of trade in the west and tra versing the rich mineral resources of the South and Northwest down to the seaboard, with three grand outlets at Savannah, Charleston and Port Royal, all of them doing a share of the new .business which this great railroad would create, and which would give them something more than cotton, which is now relied upon almost ex clusively for exports because nothing else can be made to pay or to compete with the larger systems to the more l?stern ports,or by the Illinois Central to New Orleans. There is a great deal pending in the important law suit now goins on be tween the Thomas and Ryan syndicate and the L. & N. for the half interest in the Georgia lease. It is my im pression that the L. & N. will soon fiOu'trol the C. & W. C. R. R., and in that case they would be better able and more disposed to connect with the We.?t, but would probably oppose the Black Diamond as thc L. & N. has im- ] jnepse interest in the coal and iron rc gions of the South and control about 5,000 miles of railroad. It is a very interesting question for us here, for the L. & N. wants an outlet and we ?.re anxious that her main terminal should be Port Royal whick offers io many more advantages than the two other ports. The project and plan of the Black Diamond Railroad is a grand one, and, if carried out, would be of great benefit to the entire South. It would develop its great resources as nothing else could do, and bring it in to such ?01016 proximity to the great West for mutual trade and commerce, which would induce settlers to come South and improve our waste lands and bring with them some of the Wastern life and energy which has done so much to astonish the world. .We must and will have a great rail road from the South Atlantic like the Pennsylvania system leading to the West under one control. The Black I Diamond fills the bill completely, and can do more for us than any other syndicate, either the L. & N. or the Southern R. R., both of which are striving to control the destiny >of the South." Judge J. S. Cothran, of Abbeville, died last Sunday morning in New York, where he had gone to have a surgical operation performed. His remains were brought to Abbeville and interred yesterday afternoon. By his death South Carolina loses another able and influential citizen, and he will be missed by the people of the whole State, whom he served faithful I ly in war and. peace. Judge Cothran I was born in Abbeville County August ! 8,1830. In his boyhood he attended the hold field" schools, then went to Erskine College for a year, and after ward went to the University of -Geor gia, from which he graduated in 1852.. He-returned to Abbeville, read law and in 1854 was admitted to the Bar. He practiced law until the breaking out of the war, when he volunteered as a privatein Co. B.,Orr's Regiment. He was finally promoted tb Captain of the company, and during the war was wounded three times. In 1870 Judge Cothran was elected Solicitor of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, in which position he served until May, 1881, when Gov. Hagood appointed him Judge of the same Cirouit to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Judge Thompson. He served as Judge for eight years, ? nd upon the death of Col. D. Wyatt Aiken wai elected as his successor to -Congress, where he was when selected as general counsel for the Southern Railway, in which capacity he served up to the time of his death. In every trust he was faithful and true, and his mem ory wili long be cherished by his legion of friends. Still Figbtirg Uncle Sam. 

COLUMBIA, Dec. 5.-The general indications are that thc dispensary management and the Administration do not expect any radical change in the dispensary law. The tendency from these sources will be to leave the law as nearly as it stands at pres ent-as possible. There is just at this time ro more chance of the passage of a prohibition bill, and by that is meant a dispensary law for medicinal, sacramental and scientific purposes only, than there is for the passage cf a high license Act. A resolution may be passed to the effect that the intention of the dispensary law is to regulate the sale of liquor and strictly not for money making. Such an ex pression maj' even be incorporated in the new ''Administration" bill that is to-be proposed to the General Assem bly, but it will be more of a blind than anything else, and it will be noted that there will be no change in the management of the business or the price of the liquors. To show that the lawmakers do not propose te allow profits to be made, and that liquor is only to be sold for medicinal, sacramental and scientific purposes, it would be as well to fix prices in the law. There are some who argue that if the price of liquors be doubled that it will have the effect of reducing the consumption as well as the profits to the dispensary, while on the other hand it is argued that when the State says that it does not propose to make any profit on the sale of liquor, it should sell the goods at actual cost, plus thc cost of handling. It is now contended, and has all along been so contended, by a ccrtaiu element of dispensary advocates that thc profit feature was a mere incident of the law. The reports for the month of Octo ber indicate that there has been a considerable falling off in the sales through the dispensary, although for the last few days there has been an increase in the business, supposedly on account of the Christmas trade. News and flourier. Killed by Wood Alcohol. BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 30.-A special to the Age-Herald from Ma plesville, Ala., says: Seven meu are dead and seventeen more arc not ex pected to live from the result of drink ing a mixture of wood alcohol and cheap whiskey. Thc liquor was bought in Selma, Ala., by Bill Ander son and another farmer and brought herc by them and retailed to farmers and laborers on the Mobile and Ohio extension, which is being graded by this place. A great number of farm ers and railroad hands purchased some of thc mixture and immediately after drinkiug thc concoction were taken violently ill. No physician was at hand and many of them died before attention could bc given them. The alcohol was labelled "for mixing paint only." Thc affair has created a great ! sensation. Anderson and his partner j are among the dead. Bill Anderson j and J. L. JoncB, the two men who ? bought the stuff, are thc only names ! obtaiiable at present. Rocky River Items. It is only fifteen days until Christmas when we will bid farewell to the old year. Moving seems to be the work of the day in this pretty and fair community. We have lost a faithful and true-heart ed friend whom we will never forget in days to come, in the death of our beloved neighbor, Mr James. C Hall, who died at his home near thia place last Wednesday night, Deo. 1st, at about 10 o'clock. He was not sick bat a few minutes. He xe* marked to his family that morning and several of his friends that he had a pre sentiment that came to him the night be fore, bnt did not tell what it was. He said it was a good one, and he ?IBO Bald th at morning that he was not going to be here long. He was in his usual health until a few minutes before he fell asleep, when ne got np and told his wife to get Borne soda and water, which she did. He drank it, and again went to bed, and atonoe he gave three or four long gasps for breath, and before bis son could get to bim be was gone. He was 67 years of age last October. He leaves a wife and three cbildren to cherish his memory. INO, - There are floating stories occasionally of frog fa-ms here and there, but all apocryphal, Forest and Stream says, if by farming be meant the artificial propa gation of frogs as fishes are propagated in hatcheries, and reared through . he suc cessful stages from the egg to maturity. M. F. Chamberlain, of the United States fish commission, says that while the value of frogs as food ii now thoroughly recognized in this country, to such a de gree, indeed, that the United States con sumes more frogs than are eaten in any other country, not excepting France it self, human ingenuity has not as yet de vised a method of carrying artificial cul tivation^beyond the larval stage. It ia comparatively easy to stock a pond w;ith breeding frogs or with tadpoles. Thev may be protected against their natural enemies, but the insurmountable trouble is to furnish food for the young frogs. Live food is absolutely requisite, but there is no practical device to furnish in sects. The conclusion is that frog raising for the markes; can be conducted only where food is naturally abundant, as in swamps. I- One of the greatest achievements ol modern civilization is in the security, comfort and convenience of travel. The New York newspapers relate that on Fri day last five children, all girls, in three separate groups, arrived in that city un attended from Europe. Ono of them, like Sebil, a little blue-eyed, five-year old, came from her home in Central Rus sia, with the directions of her route on a tag pinned to her bib. Gentle railroad and ateamship employees took her frorx conveyance to conveyance until she reached her father in New York. Two other children, 7 and 5 years old, trav elled from Russia to New York witn no attendance in the same ship. Two mor? girls, from 7 to lOJcame in another ship from Austria. Their parents were wait ing for tbem o?< their arrival. - The most important part of Secretary Bliss's report is that relating to pensions. He makes the astounding statement that "200,000 pension claims are awaiting ac? judicatii.n( and it is estimated that 40 cr 50 por cen r ol' these will bo fi oally ad mil ted." Ami this thirty-two years and a half after r.he close of the war, with 970, 014 names already on the rolls ! Tihe Secretary estimates that "if those claioie are rapidly adjudicated they will swell the pension roll from $5,000,000 to $7,001), 000." Judging by the past, the increase is certain to be much more than this. - Gullible farmers ol' Allen County, Ohio, have been buncoed by a swindler who went through the country exhibit ing an enormous ear of corn,, from which he sold choice kernals at choice prices foi seed. Tho ear was made from several smaller ears carefully cut up and ingeni ously glued together in the natural form of a big ear. - The Methodist has a good remedy for most of life's irritations : "Speak well o? everyone. If you cannot, then Bpeak no ill. Silence here is golden. Thin docs not moan that no criticisms are permissi ble, but never say of others what you would not be willing to say to them or in their presence." - There were 75 postmasters in thiis country, and the expensesxtf the depart ment were but $32,000 a year in Washing ton's administration ; and there are now over 70,000 postmasters, and the service costs 802,000.000 a year. - The New York World says that thu8 far this season nine persons have been killed in fcotball games and 208 maimed: 17 of these for life.
