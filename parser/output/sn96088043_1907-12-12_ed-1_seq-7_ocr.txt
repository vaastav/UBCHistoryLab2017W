RESUME OF MESSAGE! President's Communication Conservative Document. Is I xnm protective aytem and any etiort to I uproot it could not but cauae widespread in dustrial disaster. Insther words, the prin ciple of the present tariff law could not with I wisdom be changed. But in a country or such phenomenal growth as ours It Is prob ably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefily scrutinised so a to see that no excessive or Improper benefits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue la provided and that our' foreign I trade la encouraged. There must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the dlf- I ference tn cost of production here and abroad; that is, the difference In the labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever be a, cardinal point ct American policy. The question should be approached purely from a busi ness standpoint: both the time and the I manner of the change being such as to WOUld Delay Tariff Legislation Until turbance In the business world, and to give I and keep them on a satisfactory basis i one the least play for selfllsh and fac- 1 of the mom important and one of the most I ttonal motives.

The Navy. It was hoped The Hague Conference might deal with the question of tha limitation of armaments. But even before It had assem bled Informal inquiries had developed that as regards naval armamenta, tha only one u-hi.'h this country had any Interest, It was hopeless to try to devise any plan for which there waa the slightest possibility of securing assent of the nations gathered at The Hague. No plan was even proposed which would have had tne aaaeni 01 mora than one first-class power outside sf tha United States, ffhe only plan that seemed at all feasible, that of limiting the alM ot battleships, met with no favor at all. It is evident, therefore, that It Is folly fo.l this Nation to base any hope of aecuiin( peace on any International agreement as l tha limitation of armamenta. Such balna the fact it would be moat unwise for uai to stop the upbuilding of our Navy. T build one battleship of tha best and most advanced type a year would barely keep our fleet up to Its present force. This II not enough. In my Judgment, wa should this year provide for four battleships.

For several years evidence has been accumulating that addi tional legislation la needed. Tha recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to Incur liability ot business disaster, since your body adjourned there haa been a fluctuation ln the Interest on call money from 2 per cent to 80 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six month. The Secretary of tha Treasury had to- step la and by wise action put a stop to tha most violent period of os - dilation. Even worse than such fluctuation as the advance ln commercial rates and the uncertainty felt In tha sufflency of credit oven at high rates. All commsrclal Interests suffer durln. each crop period. Excessive ratea for call money In New York attract money from tha Interior banks Into the speculative-field. Thla depletes tha fund that would otherwise be available for commercial usee, and commercial borrowera are forced to pay abnormal rates, ao that each Fall at tax, In tha shape of increased Interest charges.

Unfor tunately, however, many of the proposed changea must ba ruled from consideration t.c.n.. thev are complicated, are not easy of comprehension and tend to disturb exist ing rights and Interests. We must also rule out any plan which would materially Impair tha value of tha United States 2-per cent bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the Issue of which waa made under conditions peculiarly creditable to the Treasury. I do not press any especial plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert com mittees of bankere. Among tha plans whlcn atra possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration Is that rs ceatedly brought to your attention by tha present Secretary of tha Treasury, tha es sential featurea of which hava been ap- J. roved by many prominent bankers and bus neaa men According to this plan National banks should ba permitted to issue a speci fied proportion of their capital in notes of at given kind, tha Issue to bo taxed at ao lilgh a rate aa to drive tha notea back when not wanted In legitimate trade. This plan would not permit tha Issue of currency to aMve banka additional profits, but to meet . Tho emergency presented by times ef atrln sjancy. for immediate Action.

The work of the Reclamation Service In developing the larger opportuni ties of tha western half of our country for irrigation is more important than almost any other movement. The constant purpose of the Government In connection with the Reclamation Service haa been to use the water resources of the publlo lands for the ultimate greatest good of the greatest num the day. It works grim hardship to the I ber; In other words, to put upon the land ordinary wage-worker and his family to have the effect of sucn an accident ran aoieiy upon him: and, on the other hand, there are whole classes of attorneys who exist only by Inciting men who may or may not have been wronged to undertake suits for negligence.

The primary object Is to encourage among our people economy and thrift, and by the use of postal savings bunks to give them an opportunity to husband their resources, particularly tnose wno nave n:. .... tles at hand for depoeltlhg their money In savlnrs banks. Viewed, however, from the experience of the part few weeks, it is evi dent that the advantages of auch an Inatl tltlon are still more far-reaching. Timid depositors have withdrawn their savings for the time being from National banks, trust companies and savings banks; Individuals have hoarded tnelr casn ana tne wor.n men their earnings; all of which money has been withheld and kept ln hiding or ln the safe deposit box to the detriment of pros perity. Through the agency of the postal savings banks such money would be re stored to the channels of trade, to ths mu tual benefit of capital and labor. I further commend to the Congrea. the con sideration of the Postmarter-General's recom mendation fpr the exleronon or tne parcel, post, especially on the rural routes. There are now aH.215 rural routes, serving nearly 15.000.000 people who do not have tn. aa vnnta.ea nf t ha Inhabltanta of cities In ob taining their supplies.

The duty of the National Govern ment to guard the personal and property rights of the Indians within her borders remains of course unchanged. AMhHA I reiterate my recommendations of last yesr as regards Alaska. Home form of local self government ahould be provided, as simple and Inexpensive as possible; It Is Impossible for the Congress to ai-vote tne neceacary inn. to all the little details of neceanery Alaskan l.vl.lntlnn. Hoad bulldlnx and railway build ing should be encouraged. The Governor of Alaska should be given an ample appropriation wherewith to ornaniie a rnrce to preserve tne nubile neace. Whlnky selling to the natives ahould be made a felony. The coal land laws should be changed ao as to meet tne peculiar needs of the territory. This should be at tended to at once: for the present laws permit Individuals to locate large areas of tne puri ne nnmaln for aoeculatlve DUrposes. and cauae an Immense amount of trouble, fraud and litigation. There should be another Ju dicial division established. As early aa pos sible lighthouses and buoys snouia ne estao llshed as aids to navigation, especially In and about Prince William Sound, and the survey of the coast completed. There Is need of llbersl appropriations for lighting and buoy. Ing the southern coast and Improving the aM. to navla-ation ln Southeastern Alaska. One of the great industries of Alaska, as of ruget riouna ana tne uiumui., .. nimun fishing. Gradually, ny reason or iara o: r.rnoar laws, this Industry Is being ruined It should now be taken In charge, and ef fectively protected, by the United Blates Government. , The courage and enterprise of the eltlsens of the far Northwest In their projretea Alaska. i.linn-Paclftc lxixsltlon. to be held In HKlO. should receive liberal encouragement. This exposition Is not sentimental In Its concep tion, but seeks to exploit the nstural re sources of Alaska and to promote the com merce, trade and Industry of the Pacific Statss with their neighboring stste. snd with our Insulsr possessions and tha neighboring countries of the Pacific. The exposition asks no losn from the Congress, but seeks appro priations for Nstlonsl exhlblta and exhibits of the Western dependencies of the General Government. The Mate of Washington and tna city of Seattle have shown the chsracter Istlc Western enterprise In large donations for the conduct of thla exposition.

Rut the Medical Department la not the only department for which Increased pro vision snouia be mnae. 1 ne rnto 01 par tor the officers should be groatly Increased I there Is no higher type of cltlzon than the American regular officer, and he should have a fair reward for his admirable work. There should be a relatively even greater Increase In ths pay ror the ennstea men. An especial provision should be made for estab lishing grades equivalent to those of war rant officers In the Navy which ahould be open to the enlisted men who serve suf ficiently lung and who do their work well. Inducements should be offered sufficient to encourage really good men to make the Army a life occupation. The prime needs of our present Army Is to secure and retain competent noncommissioned officers. This difficulty rests fundamentally on tha ques tion of pay. The noncommissioned officer does not cor- rspond with an unskilled laborer; he corre sponds to the best type or sKlliea workman or to the subordinate official In civil Insti tutions. Wsges have greatly Increased In outside occupations in the last 40 years and the pay of the soldier, like the pay of. the officers, should he proportionately Increased The first sergeant of a company, If a good man. must he one of such executive and admlnletatlve ability, and such Vnowledge of his trade, as to be worth far more than we at present pay him. The same Is true of the regimental sergeant major. The. men should be men who hsa ruuy resoivea to make the Army a life occupation and they should lie able to look forward to mil. reward: while only men properly qualified should be given a chance to secure thee, flnal r.wnras. - ne increase over tn. present pay need not be great In the lower grades for the first one or two enlistments, but the Incrcs.e snouia ds maraea for tne noncommissioned officers of the upper grades who serve long enough to make It evident thnt they Intend to stay perma nently In the Army, while additional pay should be given for high qualifications In target practice. Among the officers there should be se vere examinations tn weed out the unfit up to the grade of Major. From that po sition on appointments should be solely by selection and lt should be understood that a man of merely average capacity could never get beyond the position of Major, while every man who serves In any grade a certain length ef time prior to promotion to the next grade without getting the pro motion to the next grade should be forth with retired. The practice marches and field maneuvers of the last two or three years have been Invaluable to the Army. They should be continued and extended. A rigid and not a perfunctory examination of physical capacity has been provided for the higher grade officers. This will work well. Unless an officer haa a good physique, unless he ran stand hardship, ride well, and walk falily, he la not fit for any position, even after he haa become a Colonel, before he has beer me a Colonel the need for physical fltneaa In the officer Is almost as great as tn the enlisted man. I hope speedily to see Introduced Into tha Army a far mora rigid and thoroughgoing test of horsemanship for all field officers than at present. There should ba a Chief of Cavalry just aa there Is a Chief of Artillery. Perhaps the most Important of all legis lation needed fur the benefit of the Army Is a law to equalize and Increase the pay of officers and enlisted men of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Revenue-Cutter service Such a bill haa bsen prepared, which It Is hoped will meet with your favorable consideration. The next most essential measure Is to authorise a number of extra officers as mentaloned above. To make the Army more attractive to enlisted man. It Is absolutely essential to create a service corps, such as exists In nearly every modern army In the world, to do the skilled and unskilled labor, Inseparably connected with military administration, which la aow Th. llasrue.
