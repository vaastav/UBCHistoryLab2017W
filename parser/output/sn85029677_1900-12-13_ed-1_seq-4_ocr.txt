THE HERALD. PHILLIPSBTJBG. - KANSAS. ESTABLISHED IN 1877 J. M. TADLOCK, PUBLISHER Oaa Year Six Months PROPRIETOR J1.50 75 Thubsdat. December, 13, 1900. The big strike of telegraphers on the entire Santa Fe railroad system is another indication of prosperity. Men strike against a redaction of wages only when they are prosperous yon know. Keep your eye on Mark Hanna's "Ship Subsidy Bill." No greater steal has ever been proposed in the Ameri can congress, yet the president en dorses it in his message and urges its passage. The Bill provides that $9,000,000 a year, for 30 years, Bhall be paid to the owners of the present steamship lines, as a pare gift. Gen. EsgaD, of rotten beef scandal fame, who was convicted by a conrt martial and whose sentence was corn mated by President MoKinley to six years suspension from duty at $6,000 a year, has been vindicated again. The president has jast given him a fall pardon, restored him to his rank, and placed him on the retired list with fall pay for life. Fred Dumont Smith, a republican senator-elect and a close and confi dential adviser of Gov. Stanley, has a soheme to cross the Belgian hare and the jack rabbit. He thinks it will be the easiest way to fill np the dinner pail of the western farmer. He wants a big legislative appropria tion, of course, as he is in full aooord with his party, which always propos es subsidies, protection," etc , for all infant industries. It is in order now for Will White to tell who raked the "ash heap" again. Reciprocity and Free Trade. -"The policy of reciprocity," says President McKinley in his message "so manifestly rests upon ths princi ples of international equity and has been so repeatedly approved by the people of the United States, that there ought to be no hesitation in either branch of the congress in giv ing to it fall effeot." It may be taking too much for granted to assume that this official declaration by the president signifies a relaxation of his strict views on the tariff. There are many republicans, it is true, who are highly influential in the party, who are firmly convinced that protection for the so-called "in fant industries" of America is no longer necessary, and who believe that our ports should be thrown open to the trade of the world. It is doubt ful, though, whether Mr McKinley is prepared as yet to make a concession so liberal as that. To the careful student of political economy, however, reciprocity, in its widest sense, means nothing more nor less than free trade. It implies that the United States shall bay of the countries which bay of it. Bat this arrangement cannot be perfected as long as the government maintains a tax on imposts to discourage a free exohan&re of nroduots. There can be no genuine reciprocity under the maintenance of tariff duties, and the president places himself in a thor oughly lllogioal position by advocat ing the one while holding to the other. It is believed to be Mr Blaine's shrewd idea that the republican par ty could keep up a semblance of de votion to protection and thus concili ate the manufacturing interests and at the same time emancipate itself from the growing embarrassment of the tariff by a resort to reciprocity, which, reduced to its simplest terms, means free trade. The fallacy of protection has been naturally weakened by the tremend ously increased demand for American goods abroad, and it has received a more deadly blow still through the new issue of expansion. It is, as a matter of abstract reason, as effete as the fugitive slave law, and if the president's plea for reciprocity, indi cates a desire on his part to relinquish his hold on the tariff it will only prove that he is a thoroughly saga cious politician, who can read aright the signs of the times K O. Star. The n. E. Concert. The concert given under the aus pices of the ladies of the M. church in the Opera House Tuesday night was a highly creditable performance and was greatly enjoyed by all pres ent. Lovers of music are delighted to know that our city has such an array of musical talent. The orohes tra was at its bast. The solos ' Ab sence makes the Heart grow Fonder," by Miss Elba Nipps, "Kentucky Babe" by Mrs. Ohas. McOormick, and "Swal lows" by Mrs. Poe deserve especial mention. All were listened to with rapt attention, and the applause whioh greeted each testified the ap preciation of the audience. The lad ies quartette, consisting of Mesdames Nelson, Rogers, Stinson and Tadlock, sustained and even added to the high reputation they have already estab lished. The humorous recitations by Misses May Seavey and Lulu Hahn enkratt were greatly enjoyed, as was also the farce "Woman's Bights," by Miss Ethel Lovell, Chas. Nipps and Boy Whelan. After the pretty tab leau by little Misses Louise Ohamplin and Eroelle Dupree, a selection by the orchestra closed the exeroises. The audience was not as large as might have been expeoted from the charaoter of the program, but some thing over $30 was realized. The proceeds will be applied toward car peting the church.

The message is a sober, earnest document, and one to be approved, for of course, it gives the people what they voted for. But nobody reading it would imag ine it was the expression of the head of a democratic government. There is noV one line in it for in stance, expressive of dissatisfaction with the condition of the masses of the common people The man of a thousand years hence read ing it ' would suppose that every body here was happy, and that the president had only to suggest a few little things to make our social con dition complete. The first thing mentioned in the message is "prosperity." The last word of the mesage is "peace." Mr McKinley asks for one hundred thousand soldiers. He says that six ty thousand men must be kept in the Philppines for an indefinite period. He tells us that last year we were taxed seventy-nine millions in excess of government expenditures: Ha recomends that taxes be now reduced thirty millions,' indicating his purpose to spend forty-nine millions ' more than Imsc, or at least to have the mon ey r.andy. ,H d-votes a psssage to warning na aoleTn'y sgsinsfc rational xtrav tsaaca.

He has negotiated a treaty giving Spain an extra hundred thousand dollars for small islands w forgot to take before. Spain mnst say to her self "ihere is money in being lioked." Mr. McKinley asks for further leg islation if any be devised to put us more thoroughly on a gold basis. He says not 6ne word to contradict Hanna's statement: "There are no trusts." In a feeble, perfunctory way Jike a hoy saying bis prayers, he re marks that "combinations, if injur ious," might be "restraint d." The one paragraph of importance the only new thing in the message is the statement quiokly passed over, but made none the less, that he will investigate the title of religious orders to lands at Manila. This declaration of an intention to take np the question of the friars in the Philippines will arouse very great attention everywhere. The Filipinos are to be made good Americans, almost as good as we are. The savage tribes are to be treated by Mr. MoKinley benevolently and in a paternal raemon, as we nave treated our Indians. (How would you like to be a Filipino savage?) Mr. McKinley asks for a came to Manila via Hawaii. But he says no word of government ownership of that cable. He praises the work of the post- office, but says nothing about a par cels post system, which would delight the people, help every business man. and ruin t he great express compan ies of whioh Piatt owns one. He sas nothing of a system of postal savings bankp, which would gtv security to the deposits of the poor, give to the masses of the people the money now paid to a few govern ment bond owners and interfere with th plans of a few bankers. It is not a bad message it provides for the views and needs of the wel'-to-do. The well-to-do have got their presi dent he will do his dnty by them. If they will do .their duty by you who are not so well-to-do, it will be well. Yon are living under a stable, prosperous government managed by a well-meaning man, led by the abel- est financial minds of the country'. Yonr government is not exactly a republic, since its main concern is the welfare of a few. I' is a sort o' a cross between a mon&ren? aoa a financial oligarchy. It is just as mnch a republic as England is sn autocracy England is not an auto cracy.
