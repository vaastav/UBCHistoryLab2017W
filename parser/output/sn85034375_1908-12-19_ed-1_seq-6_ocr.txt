A voluminous mass of manuscript relating to the Panama canal was transmitted from the White House to the government printing office and Monday the proofs of the printed doc ument were sent to the president. The understanding is that the execu tive intends to send it to congress for the information of such lawmakers as believe there should be an investiga tion of the canal property acquired from the French company, with the view to determine whether an Amer ican syndicate got a rake-off for ne gotiating the transaction. It is possi ble it will not be a formal message to congress, although the best informa tion obtainable Monday is that it will take that form. Senator Dick (R.), Ohio, Monday in troduced a resolution urging that Feb ruary 12, 1909, the one hundredth an niversary of the birth of Abraham Lin coln, be celebrated in a fitting man ner.

It is expected that both houses will deal, during the week, with the ques tion of the paragraph in the presi dent's message relating to the secret service. The present program in the senate is to have introduced a resolu tion similar to that adopted by the house, which authorized a committee to deal with the question and report back. At an early executive session of the senate Thursday afternoon six treaties with small European, Central and South American countries were rati fied. This was the first real business of this session in the senate, barring the action of the senate in confirming Mrs. Longstreet, wife of the Confed erate general, as a postmistrees in the south.

BIRDSONG IS NOW A CONVICT Given a Life Sentence for the Mur der of Dr. Pitta. Hazlehurst, Miss.â€”Dr. T. B. Birdsong at 11:30 was sentenced to the State penitentiary for the balance of his nat ural life for the murder of Dr. A. B. Pitts last Thursday afternoon in his own office. Dr. Birdsong was brought into the courtroom and was seated a little to the right of the judge's rostrum. Airs. Birdsong, his wife, and his mother und his sister-in-law, Mrs. Angie Birdsong, entered und took seats inside the bar. There was a general expectation that the motion for change of venue would be argued by the attorneys. Instead, however, of. proceeding with the motion at once, there was a consultation among the attorneys. They retired to the con sultation rooms and were closeted for several hours. The attorneys for the defense made a proposition to accept a verdict of guilty with a life imprison ment. Then followed a long consulta tion among the friends of Dr. Pitts' family and the attorneys for the prose cution. There was a reluctance on the part of the family of Dr. Pitts in accepting the imprisonment sentence, hut after going over tiie situation for several hours they reluctantly agreed to the proposition on the condition that the attorneys for the defense would sign a document binding themselves never to sign a petition for pardon or use any influence for securing the same. After this agreement had been reached they filed into the courtroom. After a moment's pause, Judge Potter asked it they were ready to proceed with the case. The district attorney then called for tiie indictment and proceeded with the arraignment. He read the indictment charging l)r. Birdsong with the murder of Dr. A. B. Pitts. When he had fin ished reading the indictment lie asked I)r. Birdsong how lie would plead. Dr. Birdsong answered in a distinct tone of voice, "Not guilty." Judge Potter called for jury No. 1 to take the box, and after they were seated he stated that an agreement had been reached between the prosecution and tlie defense for a verdict of guilty and fixing the punishment at imprisonment for life. The jury retired to the jury room and in a moment re turned with the following verdict: "We, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged, and fix his punish ment at life in tiie State penitentiary." Judge Potter read tiie verdict and im mediately proceeded to pass the sentence. Dr. Birdsong arose and advanced a few steps and stood in front of the court. Judge Potter said: "Dr. Birdsong, have you anything to say why sentence of this court should not be passed?" ])r. Birdsong's answer was in broken sentences and delivered under evident mental strain. He said: "I have little to say, your honor, ex cept that I so deeply regret this affair that, if by giving my life I could restore the dead doctor's I would willingly do itâ€”this minute. That's all." The words were spoken so those near him could hear and understand. He stood with bowed head for a moment and Judge Potter replied that the mat ter was one over which this court had no power nor discretion. "The court fixes your punishment at imprisonment in the State .penitentiary for the remainder of your natural life." There was a dead silence in tiie court Jaiier Burnev retired with the - > room. prisoner from the courtroom. Acting Governor Manship granted a pardon to George Powell, a Madison county man sentenced in October. 1906, to serve a term of five years in the penitentiary for grand larceny.

More than 6,000 conversions occurred in the South Mississippi conference during the past year, according to re ports made to the conference in session at Yazoo City.

PRESIDENT POUNDS PULITZER Chief Executive Wrought Up Over Certain Publications. Washington.â€”Repeated peals of laugh ter greeted the reading of the opening paragraph of the,president's message to 'ongress on the Panama canal charges Tuesday. As the secretary read the statement that the charges were "false in every particular," Senator Bailey laughed outright.

The message elicited the greatest in terest in tlie House. The members gave dose attention during the reading of the document, and there was a ripple of laughter over the president's character ization of Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the New York World. The president denounced in strong language charges that there was any thing wrong in the acquisition by the United States of the canal property. t

Griffith, a â–  PLANTERS PERFECTING PLAN For Marketing and Handling Cotton and Making Loans Thereon. Following is the report of the com mittee appointed by the Mississippi Bankers' Association to devise plans for marketing and handling cotton and mak ing loans theret o: On November 27th I foil. Oscar New ton, Hon. J. T. Thomas and Hon. W. M. Anderson, of the committee appointed by the Mississippi Bankers' Association, by special arrangement, met Hon. G. R. Hightower, Hon, G. W. Russell and Hon. J. L. Collins. representing the Farmers' Union, in joint conference at the Mer chants' Bank, in Jackson, Miss., for the â€¢purpose of considering the progress be ing made in carrying out the dations this committee made in June of this year. reconi men Said committee is pleased to report to the membership of the Association that it found nearly all of the recom mendations carried out The various forms, davits, negotiable receipts, non-negotia ble receipts, bonds, etc., recommended by this committee to be adopted by the warehouses, were found to be in good shape. The committee also found that the bond for the warehousemen, now being made by the Empire State Surety Coin panu, of New York, based upon a very rigid contract as between the warehouse men and the warehouse company, pro tects the holder of receipt in a way that is entirely pleasing to the committee, and gives assurance that the holders of receipts run very little risk of sustain ing loss. The committee is especially pleased in the selection of the company to handle the insurance on the cotton stored in the warehouses. It is found that the Farmers' Union have made sat isfactory arrangements with the Royal Insurance Company, of Londonâ€”one of the largest cotton insurance companies in the worldâ€”to take charge of the in surance on all cotton stored in the warehouses in Mississippi, under the di rection of the Fanners' Union. It was found that the representatives of this company have spent considerable time and money in rating the various houses, and in perfecting policy forms and plan ning for handling the business. Take it all in all, the committee was highly pleased with the work and prog ress thus far, and find that the storing of cotton has been made safer than ever before in the history of handling the production in this State. The holder of a warehouse receipt now has some as surance of being protected, whereas, in the past, there was absolutely none. In considering the various reports from the different sections of the State it was found, with very few exceptions, that all of the banks have fallen in line with the suggestions made by this com mittee in its former report covering loans on cotton. We regret, however, to report that in a few cases, some of the smaller banks have charged excessive rates of interest, and have otherwise im peded the true and legitimate use of funds in this direction; and one or two cases have been reported where banks have utterly failed to assist the farm ers at all. President Hightower ex pressed his appreciation of the co-opera tion given by the banks in the 8tate, and we, as a committee, wish to recom mend and urge that all banks assist in the holding movement for the farmers, wherever same is practicable and can be done without injury to other interests of the bank, which, of course, are to be protected. The price of cotton cuts a great figure in the prosperity of our section of the country, and to a large extent the bank ers are as much interested as the farm ers, for increased prices means increased deposits. It is the purpose of the committee to make diligent research, and make a full and comprehensive report at the next meeting of the Association, which we be lieve is of considerable service to the various members, and we wish to re spectfull}" ask that all banks give us the benefit of whatever experience they have had in connection with loans on cotton, and suggestions will be gladly received. This is decidedly the most important proposition before the bankers of the State, and trust that it will receive the attention that it deserves. intelligently, consisting of afli State Board at Work. The State Board of Health is engaged not only in sending a competent and qualified man to tell the people what they should know, but they are putting out literature all over the State, in the shape of posters or placards printed in big, clear, boldface type, containing nut shell sermons, which are now adorning space on the eorrrdor walls of county and municipal buildings, where they may be seen and pondered by all men. But for the lack of funds much more of the same kind of work would be done for the in formation and guidance of the people. Search For Bob Myers. S. Z. Prophet, sheriff of Leflore county, has written to the State officials for a description of the negro Bob Myers, who killed Sheriff McDougall, of Carroll county, a year or so ago, and has suc ceeded in evading capture since. Sheriff Prophet Writes that the negro is being looked for very closely by the people of Leflore county, the majority of whom happen to know something of his opera tions. There is quite a reward for Myers, and this adds to the zest which lies behind the search for him.
