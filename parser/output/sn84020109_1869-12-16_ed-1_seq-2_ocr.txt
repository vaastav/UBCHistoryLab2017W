J. S. CHURCH, Editor. Til UllSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1S00. The-U. 8. Land Office has been lately opened at Grand Island This Is in nrsuance with the arrangements jnadeSrear one year since. :, From the Chieftain, we learn that the Commissioners of Johnson county half section of WW a v - fc- v - - School land for a County Poor Farm Bishop Clarkson has ordained .three antce Indians, in the northwest cor- to the Ministry of ine Episcopal Church. . The citizens of Nebraska City gave n banquet reception to the Hon. S. F. Nuckels. Congressman elect from "Wyoming Territory, on last Tuesday evening as he passed through that city on his way to Washington. ,; "We see by the Press that the order Tor epecinl election iu Otoe county to to- mi aid to the Nebraska City, Soathwcstern Rairoad Company and the Trunk Company have been rc cinded. They have dobtles given up. building "this back door fence," and ""have more than half accomplished bo nldort for which the election was ordered." Tht "ftnilrn.ifi from St. Joseph to Savanah, in Missouri, has been lately extended nn to Marysville, in JSotla way county. The people of Nodaway county: voted yesterday on the propo sition of subscribing on the part of the couniy me sum oi v-vv-w - M.&.F. Railroad. We are not np- ' praised of the result, but presume from what we have heard that it was .favorable. The Baptist Church at Highland will be dedicated on Christmas after noon. The Mt. Zoin Baptist Church, near the Bev. Ira Moor's three, miles west of Brownville, will be dedicated on' Christmas night, and the First Baptist Church in Brownville will be dedicated on Sunday the 2Gth inst. The. Bev. Dr. G. J. Johnson, of St. Louis, will preach the dedicatory ser mon at each of these places at the times specified. The Church extend a cordial Invitation to all who cau at tend these services. -'. - . Otoe county votes on the 4th of January, 1870, on four propositions, let : To issue S5.000 ten year ten per refit, cupon bonds for bridge purposes. 2d. To issue $150,000 twenty year eight per cent, cupon bonds to aid in building the Southwestern Railroad 3d. To issue $150,000 twenty year eight per cent, cupon bonds to aid in building the St. Louis and Nebraska Trunk Railroad. 4th. To authorize the County Commissioners to levy a tax of one per cent, annually to pay the nrincinal and interest of these bonds at maturity. m 1 The elections in Texas and Missis fiirrI have resulted in favor of the Republican tickets. Their legislatures beiug largely Republican, will with out doobt, ratify the loth Amend ment. renderins it less necessary for an extra session in Nebraska for this iiiirnosr Reconstruction throughout the entire South will be completed early in the year 1870, when the Union l r - will acain float on entire in all its parts, let's hope never to be again dis turted by any "onpleasantncss" from .the most obscure quarter. The great bone of contention, "for or against universal freedom" has been destroy ed, and with it we hope may be buried the bad passions it engendered. The nation is soon to be united under the ablest administration the country has ever enjoyed. We have bright '"i '- peace. If the vote in Brownville precinct hall authorise the issuing of $100,000 worth of bonds, they are to be handed over to the B. Ft. K. & P. R. R. Com pany, without conditions. The com pany is not yet organized, nor will-it be until these bonds are issued. We are assured, however, that its officers will be competent men; and we shall ' - . i i. i r l xr . 1 . 't l aSK uiav sucu supinations Mian vc made on the part of the county as shall secure the faithful expenditure of this money by the company, in grading a line straight through the precinct, running west from Brown ville. There . is but little doubt but that the road from Quincy, in Illinois, to Brownville, will, during next sum mer, be put under contract, so far as grading is concerned. Let us, then, at the tame time, grade as much as Is possible west of this point. If Douglas and Washington pre cincts will come forward with $40,000 for the first, and $00,000 for the sec ond, a good road bed can be made through the county next summer. In the following spring It can be bridged, tied and ironed, by which time the road to Brownville from Quincy will be in operation. r We say this can be done ; but will i? .'. The' answer to this depends en tirely upon the -earnestness and una nimity with which our people go to Work. Towns where such work is now going on, are prospering beyond all precident. Plattsmouth and Ne braska City, were never so vigorously growing as now, and neither have as j'ct any better rail road facilities than fermedy. The work is only progress ion.' The farmers, the mechanics, and the laborers, air feel the good nVcts,r suiting from the work on roads running from those two towns ; Mid feel it now ; are more prosperous now than, one year ago; are more ready now than tha, to vote aid to other, roads running rveax them, be cause more firmly con vi need that it pays." ' We are more firmly convinced now than ever, that Nemaha county bxs lost one entire year. Shall ve add yet another? As time weare on, we will more clearly determine what we may expect. E.YCJy day, week, and month, that passes without deter mined action, throws the chances against us. Let the pood work begin now, and movo rapidly on to comple- 'on, " Wc havc"rcad"iliepropoition sub mitted by the City of Brownville to its voters for adoption or rejection, very carefully. Striped of its verbiage it is simply this.: Shall the city of Brownville issue '$50,000 In bonds to build a railroad from opposite Brown ville, on the bank of the Missouri river, to the St. Jo. & C. B. Railroad? If so, then the city is to appoint three trustees, conferring upon them the usual power of railroad directors, to take the bonds, negotiate them, re ceive the proceeds, and build the road. The Quincy company, is called upon to -conssent to this by the first day of March. If they don't, then-some other company on. (the .face . of, the globe Is' called upto consentto it, with out date. If none does, then the three men get no bonds, and build ho road. This muddle may suit the Democrat, but we coufess that it don't us. We believe in the Q. M. and P. Company ; believe thej' will do, if not actually repulsed and driven off the field by our stupidity, just what they say they will do. We' think- a large majority of the property . holders of this town are of the same opinion. We prefercd to generously offer that company a proposition which they would undoubtedly accept. , Instead of tliis we arc making a proposition around which clusters in the mind of every exact business man, innumera ble obstacles. The one great difficulty i our management of public affairs, is that they are controled t much by men who have demonstrated but little talent in managing theirown affairs The clear headed, closely exact, solid men of the city, are too much engaged in personal matters to give public affairs that attention which their importance demands; and so they are left to those who have little else to do, and consequently are bung lingly done. Our sympathies are strongly enlisted in favor of the ac compKshmentof the object sought to be obtained by the proposition sub mitted, and shall vote for it now, hoping that what we desire may be brought about, and that the alterna tive which the proposition hold3 out may be avoided. . The proposition submitted to the voters of Brownville precint by the County Commissioners, Is published this week for the benefit of our read ers, it occupies in ourpaper out nttie more than half the space devoted to it by the Democrat. This is the case in nearly an tne matter to ne iouna In the two papers. We publish no issue of ourpaper but what contains more reading matter than the Demo crat of the same week, and nearly twice the amount of advertising mat ter. m ' Band Festival: Some enterprising ladies of this plarc have taken it In hand to get up a festival or entertainment for the Brownville Coruot Band, to be held in McPherson Hall on the evening of December 23rd. This is a laudiblei undertaking, and highly creditable (6 those who have it in charge. . A rous ing benefit is due the "Band Boys," too, who have spent much time and money in bringing themselves to the standard of perfection at which they have arrived. No occasion presents itself, where the services of the Band are needed, and would add to the in terest and pleasure, but what they are on hand, "pay or no pay." They have the reputation, and justly, too, of being the best band in jho State; and as they have so often "made music" for the good people of Brown ville, it, is to be hoped that on the occasion mentioned the citizens of the place will be on hand, and with their characteristic liberality, give them such a benefit as will prove "creditable and just" to all. both Band and peo ple. The Band is now composed of the following worthy and permanent residents of the town : Smith, Welch, Shellenberger, Hart, McNaughton, Hacker, Bryant, McFall, Colhapp, Henderson and Shirtz. W. A special election in . Dodge coun ty, held to authorize the county of Dodge to issue its Bonds to aid the Fremont, Elkhorn Valley & Missouri Valley Railroad resulted favorably, the majority being 312 votes. The U. P. Railroad runs through the county of Dodge, and the advantages thus derived by the farmers of that county have induced them to issue bonds to aid in building another road through the county. If the farmers of this county could realize now what they will know to be facts on the comple tion of the B., Ft. Kearney & P. Rail roaa, we wouia meet witn jess oppo sition in voting aid to railroads than we now have. Railroads quicken men s actions and manners : make them more liberal and enterprising. Slower aud heavier means of inter communication make us sluggish, hide-bound and strangely conserva tive of old ways, customs and habits. Of this fact we have daily painful ev idence, more forcibly apparent when there is any public improvements contemplated. Let us lift ourselves out of these intolerable ruts, and if needs be, put down the stamps which will send the iron horse through the county. . We print tbis week the President's Message in full. This paper will be read all over the globe with deep in terest. It appeared in all the morning papers in Europe on tne . morning after it was delivered in Congress, and has been commented on In very favor able terms. It treats the Alabama, tbe Cuban the financial and the re-" construction questions in a spirit in harmony with tha great republican party, and in the true interests of the CJovernmeut. The President draws by his every act more closely around him the great republic heart of the nation, convincing the most reluctant that no mistake was made in the nomination, election, and inaugura tion of Gen. Grant as president of this great Union. Read the message and be convinced that the country is safe, and that our national honor is in the safest of bands. Capt. John IL Brown has been ap pointed rostnis(.er at Fairbury, Jef ferson county. TO 

CHILD UEX. j , XO. FOUR. As we look at the half-grown boys tiiat daily throng the sfreetabf Browh: villo without any visible means of employment, ' uneducated in any of the arts, trades or sciences, we wonder if they have any ambition ever to fill stations of usefulness when they be come fully grown up. It would be useless to write an encouraging and cheering word in hopes of arrousing them from the terrible wastefulness of time and opportunities, for they never read. They go -on ' to manhood with no thought of the future. ' The highth , of tbeir ambition is to loll around tlie street corners in hopes of getting up a dog fightor finding some scene of excitement or brutality.. They greedily feed upon these, and after wards you may see them with both hands in their pockets, heads up, eye balls rolling, and with jaws munching the quid as they relate the mornings observation to their comrades older and vountrer at the saloon door. If v , the city has been undisturbed through the day, one can readily detect it by the lazy,' listless manner in which they Stroll about. They can tell you to a fraction who has been arrested and for what, who got drunk during the day and where, who got whipped and by whom, who gambled and how much they lost. . Their facta and fig ures in this department are undenia bly correct. But what of the future? Are thev better and wiser for what they have learned: during the; day. What calling in life are they better prepared to fill. Will such knowl edge daily gained for years make them better lawyers, doctors, preachers, mechanics, tradesmen or. farmers? No boy, if he thinks at all about the future, but what wishes to become an influential man a man of property and standing in community. Bdys thus trained are not fitting themselves for any such, positions. What then are they training themselves to be? Nothing but drudges servants, back woodsmen, men who live in back alleys, on poor streets, among poverty, filth and vermin. Now, there is noth ing desirable in such a life, and not one of the boys of this county everin-J tend to live in that way ; and What is more, the' all know they will not. We ask then, why travel that road? Why be found in the company of those who are fitting themselves for just such a life, and no other? Unless you get out of the streets and into the school house, work-shop or some use ful amployment, now or soon, you will Just as surely become a vagabond, an outcast, or a poor, worthless man, and remain such all your life, as that the world exists; and the great uncon trolable reason why, will be, because you are not prepared tor anyiuiug useful. The -closing exercises of the State Normal School for the fall term came off last week at the Normal Building in Peru. We accepted Prof.'.McKen- zie's invitation so far asito attend on Wednesday. The afternoon was spent in singing by the school, in reading essays and selected pieces, in recitations and declamations by the Seminary Department. We were agreeably impressed with the great improvement in this department over what has often been our misfortune to suffer and bear with elsewhere in ex ercises of this character. The selec ted pieces and dialogues were note worthy for their patriotism, noble sen timent, sparkling humor and literary value. All sickly, sentimentalism and maudling love entertainments, so disgustingly odious and out of place in the training and education of chil dren were placed under the ban at the commencement of thejOrmal year.; and as a consequence, the public were not nauseated with such misapplied tallent and doubtful accomplishments at the close. We are under, deep ob ligations to the Board of Education and to the faculty for this reform, and hope our lesser schools will note this fact and make haste in elevating the standard of the moral, intellectual and physical forces under their su pervision and control for the coming school year. We took full notes of the manner, character and nddress of each scholar, and shall be glad in the future to make comparisons and note the improvements each will then have made. By these we form our estimate of the future coreerofthe student, the business roan and the statesman in advance of his attainment and repu tation in these several stations in life. Our greatest pleasure is derived in chronicling the onward and upward progress of those who have the nerve and the good judgement to improve the mind, to expand the soul, to in crease one's capacity for intellectual, moral and physical power, and in ex ercising it for the good of humanity ; to alleviate its sufferings and to sooth its sorrows. Our greatest pain is the knowledge that a large share jTvj of the young men. whose talent, ability and fortune, impelling them to a career of usefulness, . are catering to their bad passions and wasting their young days In the excitements of the wine cup and the gambling saloons, rather than in the halls of learning. But such is life. The Advcriticr, by reason of its large circulation and fresh reading matter, has become one of the best adverti sing mediums In Southern Nebraska. We insert no advertitneuts tutherein for wliich we do not receive the cash at our advertising rates. It contains no dead advertising matter. Our space is engaged weeks in advance, and the moment the time expires the matter is placed upon the distributing galley. We have not issued a paper for a year past that we did not leave out from one to three columns of advertising matter for which we had no room. And were it not for the extra expense in press, column rules, chases, tc, we would have increased our paper in size long since for the accommodation of advertisers. We are not in the habit of parading our success in the columns of our paper, and seldom re fer to the ftiugs which jealousy pens for the columns other journals. , Tlie Concert. . The Dye Brothers and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett held their musical entertain ment at .the first Baptist Church In this city on last Monday evening. The audience was large, and was-com-posed almost solely of our lovers of good music ; such an audience as could appreciate just such an. entertainment, and intelligently critisije thejm?s'cal ability "of the performers. The piedes selected for the evenVng ranged from the impressively solemto-trrsnudi-crous and witty; from the 6oftest6f passions 't? -the most rifurlited add frehzied; 'from the .'intellectuar and noble to the simple and unsophistica- ted; The varied characters were'well represented, by first . class tallent. The delight and sympathy; of the au dience was frequently shown by im mense cheering. Our joy is the great er, as this musical troup is Composed entirely of home talent. They, have held concerts in various t town in Southern Nebraska, where they have established a reputation'which places them among first class performers, and secured from the press flattering men tion. ' They met with very substantia encouragement on last Monday night ! The Masonic and. Chapter Festiva will be held at the lodge room in Brownville on the 27th inst. at which time the officers of .'both societies' wil be installed.

" For tho Advertiser. ebraskn State Xormal School : Mr. Editor: In the absence of an examining . committee . a few notes from a visitor In regard to the closing exercises of the State Normal School may oe oi interest to your many readers. , . . . , The exhibition of the Model School or Primary Department, in charge of Miss Anna Swan, came Off on Friday evening last, and though participated in by small children only, was highly interesting. Some of the declama tions, recitations ' and essays would have done credit to much older heads The pupils in this department have made marked proficiency during the past term. . 1 -' The examination of .the several classes commenced on Monday, and continued till Wednesday uoon. and were in a hih deirree satisfactorv. ine stuaents, witn scarcely an excep tion, acquitted themselves ncbly. J have attended nearly all the examin ations of this institution, from its open ing, ana nave never failed to be Im pressed with- the fact that its high reputation lor thoroughness and per feet order was well earned ; and vet it is out just to tne students in attend ance the past term, as well as to the faculty, to say that the examination which has just closed excelled all that have preceeded. I think I never knew any class of students who ex hibited more perfect knowledge of the studies they had been pursuinsr. Especial praise is due to the Geom etry and riiysiology classes, under Prof. Martin ; the Geology, Chemis tiy and Latin classes,- under Prof. McKenzie, and the Drawing, class, in charge or iiiss Aicott. On Monday evening an interesting address on "Man," was delivered to a large and appreciative audience, by Rev. G. A. Iteeder, of Ohio. On "Wednesday afternoon the exhi bition of the Seminary Department took place in presence of a crowded house, but owing to the fact that most of the older and more advanced stu dents belong to the Normal Depart ment, which has its exhibition at the close of next term, this entertainment was hardly equal to some which have preceded : yet the close observer could not fail to detect evidences of thor ough drill upon the part of teachers. and marked ability upon the part of students. All things considered, the State of rs eDrasKa nas reason to be proud of her Normal School. The material aid she has given it could not have been more worthily bestowed, and In no other way could she have emplowed the same amount of money and ensured an equal return of blessings upon her sons and daughters. But it must not be forgotten that the very, prosperity of the institution calls for increased aid. Already the school has outgrown the building so much so that the coming terra all the rooms in the building will be occu pied by young, ladies, and the gentle men will be forced to seek such accommodations as they cau find in the village ; and long before the next legislature shall convene, . there will be a most urgent demand for another and more commodious building, and we can but hope that the demand will be met in the spirit of an enlightened noeraiity. Pv ' rA VISITQR From the R;do Register Death by Poison A Tfaralnff to loan? Jlen. Dr. Patterson, of this city, reports a case of poisenmg by whiskey. The unfortunate subject was a young man barply of age, named, Riley, but who Jin's been laboring on a farm near this place. On Sunday evening last, four boys. including young Riley, obtained two quarts of whiskey, and in. ungodly sports ituey was inaucen to annk a greater part of the distilled damna tion. His comrades had the satisfaction of seeing him gloriously "tight" in a very . short , time, and as he did not recover, even late in. the evening, he was carried home. The facts were that he wa3 merely drunken, but his youthful strength was the victim of a comatose state, occasioned by alcohol icpoiseniug. After eighteen hours had passed. and no signs of rallying were yet evi dent, the Doctor was summoned, but alas! too late for human aid. Life was almost extinct when the Doctor arrived. In Heaven's name, let the young of this place profit from a knowledge of the end of poor, misguided, unfor tunate Riley, Try to abstain from the poisonous cup; not irom tne iear or an early death; but fearing rather the mental and sj Iritual death, which will inevitably overtake those who yield to those aiormnable excesses. Let the boys remember that Sabbath- breaker will be punished. ; TELEGRAPHIC SUMMARY.
