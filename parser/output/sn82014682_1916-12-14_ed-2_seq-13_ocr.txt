It does, however, carry important recommendations on the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Adam son eight-hour law. The president, speaking to the two houses jointly assembled on December 5, said:.' . Gentlemen of the Congress: In fulfilling at this time the duty laid ujon me by the Constitution of communicating to you from' time to time "information- of the state of the Union and recommending to your con sideration such legislative measures as may be judged ne essary and ex pedient I shall . continue the practise, which J hope; has been acceptable to you, of. leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive depart ments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and con fine myself to those matters of more general public policy with which it Eeems necessary and feasible to deal at the resent session of the Congres. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions as few as possible; but there were some, things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary in the interest of the public to do at once. - THE 

RAILROAD SITUATION In the first place. It seems to me im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining measures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had oc casion to recommend to you at the close it your last session in view of the public dangers disclosed by the unaccommodated difficulties which then existed, and which still unhap pily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country and their loco motive engineers, -conductors and trainmen. r v ' ': I then recommended: : : First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate; in or der that the commission may be en abled lo deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thorough ness which are, with its present con stitution and means of, action, , practi cally impossible. " Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages in the employ ment of all railway employes who are actually engaged in the work of op erating trains in an interstate trans portation. " Third; the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway trans portion alike for the men and for the railroads. 

FREIGHT RATE INCREASE Fourth, explicit approval by the Con gress of the consideration by the Interstate Commerce Commission of an : increase of freight rates to : meet such additional expenditures by the railroads as may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight hour day and . which have not been offset by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis-' closed justify the increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation and arbi tration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accommo dation now provided for should fail, a fullpubl!c Investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be insti tuted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And, sixth, the lodgement in the hands of the executive, of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and -such roll ing stock of the railways of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes; with authority to draft into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative official? as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. The second and third of these rec ommendations the Congress immedi ately pcted on it established the eight-hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in tiain service and it authorized the appointment of a commission to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately need ed; but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliber ate consideration of them. The fourth recommendation I do r.ot deem it ne cessary , to renew. The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground referred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the Congress with regard to such a mat ter might seem to draw in question the scooe of tho commission's authori ty or its inclination to do justice w hen there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions the increase in the Interstate Commerce ., Commis sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public investigation and assessment of industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power lo control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time1 of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. .The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who . have entrusted us with the responsi- l :u... .1 j...., ' j r guarding them in such matters would find it hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon ihtse. grave mat ters or tny unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the Interstate Com merce Commission now find it practi cally impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thor oughly but it is not unlikely that it may presently be found advisable to add to its duties stUl others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative instrument...-. More Arbitration Needed The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profouml industrial disturbances for lack of additional means p arbi tration and conciliation which the Congress can easily and promptly sup ply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the Executive to make immediate and uninterrupted use of the railroads for the concentration of the military forc es of the natioa wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention, and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the effi ciency of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the House of Represen tatives has already acted; its action needs only the concurrence of the Senate. '.' . . ; -. I would J-sitate to recommend, and i I dare say the Congress would hesi tate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occu pation should be obliged by law to continue in an employment which he desired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his Work before re ceiving the approval ' of society In doing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple into our jurisprudence which I take it for granted we are not pre pared to Introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or interrupted by the concerted action of organized bodies of men until a pub lic investigation shall have been in stituted which shall make the 'whofe question at issue plain for the judg ment of the. opinion of the nation is not to : propose any. such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop' the industrial pro cesses of the nation, at any rate be fore the nation shall have had an op portunity ' t& atquafnt itself with the merits of the case as between em' ploye and employer, time to form Its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practical means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by society of the neces sary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in it un less it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a run and scrupulous regard ror tne interests and liberties of all concern ed as well as for tlie permanent inter ests of society itself.. Important Matters ; Three matters of capital importance await the action of the Senate which have already been acted upon by the House of Representatives: The bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in promoting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bill amending the present organic law of Porto Rico; and, the bill proposing a more thorough -and systematic regula tion of ' the expenditure of money in elections, commonly called the Cor rupt Practises Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be en acted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circumstances which lender their adoption at this time not only opportune but necessary. Even delay would seriously jeopard the in terests of the countryand of the gov ernment; . . Immediate passage of the bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elections may seem to be less neces sary than the immediate enactment of the other measures to which I refer; because at least two years will elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dangers to the public morals of the present method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under recent observation and the methods of expenditure can be frank ly studied -in the light of present ex perience; and a delay would have the further very serious disadvantage of postponing action until another 'elec tion was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can be taken now with facts for guidance and with out suspicion of partisan purpose. To Aid Trade " I shall not argue at length the de stability of giving a freer hand in the matter of combined and concerted effort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately as sume, has indeed already assumed, a magnitude unprecedented in our ex perience. We have not the necessary instrumentalities for its prosecution; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an ade quate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal ob stacles and create a basis of undoubt ed law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated li cense. The thing must be done now. because the opportunity is ; here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. In argument for the proposed am-1 endments of the organic law of Portol Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of : extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious 5 doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending, measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential, particular. We ought to do It at once. . There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them w ill ' no doubt be found ahd action taken upon them. Inasmuch us this Is, gentlemen, probably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth Congress. I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have cooperated with you in the many : measures of constructive policy with w hich you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor in such company. I take the liberty of congratulating you upon the comple tion of a record of rare serviceable ness and distinction.
