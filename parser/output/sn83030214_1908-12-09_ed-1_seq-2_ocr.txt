WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. Our natural resources are so related that the use of one affects -the use of all the others. This in especially true of our waterways. Every man, woman and Child within our borders has an in terest in them, through navigation, power, irri gation or water supply, or through all four, vve have neglected our waterways more than any otner natural resource, and we must put an end to that neglect. The Inland Waterways Commission has told us how.. ' , , First. let us prepare a comprehensive plan ror inland waterway development along the lines pointed out by the commission. Such a plan must consider every use of the waters; it must put the interests of all the people in advance of any pri vate interests whatsoever. The preparation of this comprehensive plan should bejriri at once. Second. let us proceed immediately with the con struction of the waterways for which plans have already been approved, and which we are now cer tain will fit Into the outlines of the general plan. Our previous policy of procrastination, delay, ana fitful and partial action has borne its perfect fruit. Our waterway* are deserted, and in return for our vast expenditures we have little or no actual navigation to show. The people are ready for a change. Let us have it. and at once. • If we can pay the cost from current revenues, let us do so. If not. let us issue> bonds. By either method, let us have the waterways), and that quickly, he plan and the work can and should proceed to gether. While the work we are sure of Is being begun, the plan for the reft can be prepared. The work, therefore. should begin nt once. But there must not be the slightest recklessness or waste of money. No work whatever should he un dertaken that has not been thoroughly examined and fully approved by competent experts. Above all. not one cent should be expended to satisfy spe cial Interests, whether of a business or a local ity, or to promote any man's political fortunes. This is" too large, a matter to be handled In such a way. We must approach it from the point of view of the national Interest, under the guidance of the wisest experts in engineering, in transportation and in all the use? of our streams. Forests and waterways cannot .be separated in any successful treatment of either" -Forest protection and river development must go hand in hand. The three things which should be done without any further delay are, therefore: First -To provide for a comprehensive plan of waterway development. Second— To begin at once on work already planned that will surely fit into the % larger plan. Third- provide amply for forest protection against fire, against reckless cutting, against wan ton or reckless destruction of all kind?, and to se cure th» Appalachian »nd White Mountain, na tional forests without delay. Mr. Taft was the last speaker following the President. As lie came forward to speak the President sprang to his feet, and with a wave of the hand brought every person in the theatre to his feet. The harder Mr. Roosevelt clapped the harder the people responded, and the harder they clapped the harder Mr. Taft laughed. "One reason why the Constitution should be construed to give large 'powers to conservation." said Mr. Taft. "is that a conservation plan, to be effective, must be one comparatively large enough to cover the whole country; and a fur ther demonstration of the necessity of nation alizing the work of conservation is found in the fact that no one state is financially equal to the carrying out of an adequate conserva tion policy. It is vitally necessary that we have co-operation on the part of the states. I shall content myself with a statement of my deep sympathy with this movement, and of my pur pose to carry on the policy so admirably begun and prosecuted by President Roosevelt. I agree with what the President has said to you about the issuance of federal bonds for the funding of permanent national improvements." The joint meeting brought together the mem bers of the consultation committee and their helpers, the delegates to the Southern Commer cial Congress, the members of the Rivers and Harbors Congress and others interested in work- Ing out a comprehensive plan for making the most of the lands, minerals, forests and waters that belong to the public domain of the United States.

TAFT AND TIIE SOUTH. Hie Speech Finds Cordial Approval in Washington. I Ft- n T'-e Tribune Buiwrti I Washington, Dec. B-- John M. Parker, a Louisiana planter, who entertained I resident Roosevelt on bis bear hunt In the cane brake? in that state a veer ago. declares that PresMent-riect Taft has struck ihe keynote o? Southern soda] and political punajess by the sentiments he expressed in his speech in New York yesterday. Mr. Parker, who is in the city attending the Southern Commercial Convention, mailed at the White House to-day to tell the President how well pleased he was. - Dot the question of keeping the negro o ;• of - in the South. ' he explained later, "only preventing the Ignorant negro from exercising the right of franchise. Judge Taft has the right con ception of exorcising the problem that has con fronted our people." Mr Parker considers the attitude of Judge Taft of tiie ereatest significance, and believes it will bs of incalculable benefit io the whole country in and to the South En particular. other White House callers who commented on the speech viewed it in much the same light. Al though they showed a disinclination to talk for pub ■ !. the> were almost unanimous in the belief that the "Soli < South" was a thing of the past so far bs national politics 1? concerned, and that the agitation of "force" bills and talk of reduction of Southern representatioa ha Congress would be empty <-iair.or, if these subjects were not buried beyond political resurrection by Mr. Taft? speech. a —

NEW-YOkX DAILY TRIBUNE, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER *. **» TO ASK CARNEGIE AGAIN }VASTS. VIEWS OS TARIFF. Subpoena May Follow Declination— Miles Urges Commission. (From The Tribune Bureau. 3 Washington. Dec. 8. -The Ways and Means Com mittee, in executive session to-day, decided to send a second Invitation to Andrew Carnegie askin? him to appear before that body and discuss the tariff. It la also understood that the committee decided that in case Mr. Carnegie declined the second in vitation, as he did the first, a subpoena would be served on him daring his stay in Washington. which would force him to appear and give in formation on the Steel and other schedules. The committee also began the preparation of a list of witnesses who will he summoned to appear The names were not divulged, as a resolution was passed committing the members to secrecy .but It i, learned that several newspaper editors^ ana other, who criticised the committee will ha%« an opportunity to express themselves In person. It JJ understood that among others who will he , u»ue on to appear are representatives of the large Pack ing houses, steel men, jobbers, commission men and retailers. 8e cretary The second appearance of H. E. Mi les. se , of the National Manufacturers' Assocla on, h^ore the committee this morning, brought out son e^n testing testimony. Mr. Mile. made an argu ment for a tariff commission and said that _ the manufacturer* of the country favored^ ,?'£ He did not ask the delegation by <-'<>n«reM ,£ its constitutional powers to raise revenue but -us rested the appointment of a board of experts, WOO i" .d lethe tariff a life study. 11. contended that the present system of obtaining *»'«™£ n was inadequate, and declared that, in his op nion. . commission would sooner or later be appointed Representative Payne differed from Mr Miles as .the benefits of a tariff commission. If >ou had a permanent bureau of that kind, he sa.d •it m -ould be constantly agitating changes lathe tariff an.l there Is nothing which would proxe more' detrimental to the business ■of the eountnr. What the business world wants to know is that the tariff questions are settled. I think that a tariff commission of this kind would be one of the worst things that could happen to the country. ' 

BRITONS DESIRE FORMER TARIFF. London. Dec. 8.- Replying to the. Board of Trade's invitation io various chambers of ctfauuerce to express their views on the proposed changes m the American tariff, the Huddersfleld chamber sug gests that the government .should urge the I nite.i Btatea to restore the tariff which prevailed prior to the McKir.ley and Dtngtey tariffs. These tariffs. according to the chamber, have proved pract caUy prohibitive to the heavier and the lew priced woollen and worsted goods, and must therefore have resulted in a decrease in the # reveni'e of the United States. HOP BILL IN BRITISH HOUSE. London. Dec. S.— A bill prohibiting the use of hop substitutes in the manufacture of beer was introduced in the House of Commons this after noon by' David Lloyd-George. Chancellor or the {Exchequer. This bill, which the tariff reformers hail as a protective measure, was read for the first time. In addition to stepping the use or hop substitutes, it prohibits the importation of hops except in bass properly marked. WASTS NEW ARMY BILL. President, in Special Message, Urges Emergency Measure. Washington. Dec 8.- An emergency volunteer army measure was advocated to-day by Presilent Roosevelt in a special message sent to Congrese. and the draft of the bii! accompanying the mes sage was introduced in tlie Senate by Mr. O_llom. The President says the bill Is 'ntended to replace the present law, which was placed on the statute book;* piecemeal and hurriedly, partly on the eve of the war with Spain and partly after hostilities had actually begun." After declaring the pr°<<en;. law to be faulty and wholly inadequate to a speed? and proper organization of a volunteer force, the President says the bill proposed, which was drawn under supervision of the chief ef staff of the army, has the hearty approval of the War Department. The message says further: It is designed to afford the complete machinery by which, should we be confronted with a foreign war. the executive power could proceed at once to transform'' enthusiastic nnd patriotic citizens into efficient and organised soldiers. Happily there is at present no cloud upon our horizon, but that very fact affords up the best opportunity to proceed with deliberation and care iv the preparation of laws adeqyate and indispensable for our possible war needs; It is pointed out by the President that the pro posed measure would not call for a dollar* ex penditure during the years of peace, and Its enact ment into law now "would merely be to place at the disposal of the executive power machinery whereby should war threaten the means to wage it could be swiftly brought into being. "Grounded upon the law," he continues, "there must be a vast mass of detail wrought Into a comprehensive plan and ready upon the Instant to be set Into mo tion. The Congress has provided a General Staff corps and built- for the War College a permanent and beautiful home; and the next logical step is to pass a comprehensive volunteer act to the end that the existing agencies may work out in advance the details Of its execution." The proposed bill is elastic: under it* provisions a force of 2,000,000 men could be raised as well as one of 50,000. Dr. Lyon's

FOWLER'S VIEWS Congressman Discusses Financial and Currency Legislation. Washington. Dec. S.-Charles N. Fowler, chair man of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, gave out to-night a statement with re gard to financial and currency le*ls!atoon at the present session of Congress. He began by em phasizing the importance of principles rather than of particular bills in thin matter, and urged "all business men, bankers and lawyers, who should inform themselves upon this most important ques tion before the American people, that they study principles, and.- he said. "I hope my suggestion may fall under the eye of every one who takes an interest in financial and currency legislation." The statement continues: No government should have any demand a * l }*£, tions outstendingr, because such obligations weak- I en and Imperil the credit of the K^roment whlcn , it is constantly losing in The form of bonded in , debtednesa. No government of /^.."^Pons * £ consequence now lias any demand obligations il o 'tf: standing, except the United States to t™peri l It 9 I credit and disturb and unsettle tlw commercial ■ condition? at any moment as well. T , he . rPf " r *- r °b£ ' United States notes should be eliminated either by ( retirement or conversion into gold l ' ertl( oat i«t : The reserves of the banks in any country J^ould be coined out of the standard of value of that country. Our standard of value is gold; therefore our bank reserve should be all in gold or gold cer tificates, which are the same thing „.„„- The only true and the most economical currency !is an untrammelled credit currency. That U.a j eurrencv which is interchangeable with bank de ' posits that are subject to check. Such a currency ! very greatly facilitates trade and, commerce and ! prevents currency panics. A bank Is a quasi-nubile ! institution. It is related not only to its depositors. i but to the entire community where It is located ' as well, and also to the whole commercial world of ! the nation of which every bank is an Integral part. "Salus populi suprenrw est lex" "The welfare ! of the people is a supreme law." How can we pro i tect ourselves in ■ a nation*' sense from the dire '■ consequences of any local disturbance which men ! aces the business of the whole country? First -We should be able to know both the qual ity and the quantity of the bank reserves In every nankins institution in the United States. This can only lie done by one single administration of all the" banking institutions. It Is essential that the 1 reserve should be gold, and not bank notes nor United' States notes, both of which are mere de ; mands for money, nor any other form of credit, ■ because credit based on other credit is the source ; of inflation, which must inevitably lead to com ■ mercial disaster. If the required reserves of our . national bankn of 15 and 25 per cent, respectively, i for the various tie* of the country are essential to sound banking, then, though the reserves are ! actually in gold. but. in fact, amount to only 10 or I 5 per cent or jiractieally nothing, credit has ex panded to a breaking and ruinous degree and com merce generally must pay the penalty. This is just what happened In 1907. The reserves in our slate bank? and trust companies had fallen to about 6 per cent, and even these reserves were largely in bank notes. How can we prevent a recurrence of this same condition? One answer alone can be made — by the uniform administration of our bank ins institutions. . , Second— should know that the savings of the masses in all th» states are invested in specified securities of a conservative character, and not used ' for speculative purposes, which invariably leads to an unhealthy condition, disaster and untold misfortune. This all to be desired end can only be secured throughout the United States by a uniform supervision of all commercial banks, which during the last few years have been receiving savings ac counts and using: them for commercial and specu lative purposes, when such accounts should be con fined to conservative investments. Third— During the last twenty years a distinctly new phase of th« banking business he* 1 developed enormously in ;he United States, known as the trust company business. All trust funds should be segregated from the commercial accounts, and not diverted by (scheming speculators to the promotion of their enterprises, thereby developing unhealthy conditions, which In turn breed and precipitate panics. Such a proper and uniform administration of all trusts can only be secured by the application of sound principles through a uniform system; end this is essential, since the whole banking fabric of Iho country may be thrown into utter confusion by loose methods, abusive trusts, and especially by dis honesty in any single city, as we have lately learned through a sad and serious experience We have just had a lesson which ought not to be for gotten, now that we have learned it so recently and at so great cost. "The welfare of the people is the supreme law," or. 'giving it a broader interpretation, "the protec tion of all is the supreme law of the land/ This "all' does not mean the people of the city or the state where the falling bank is located, but rather the whole people, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. from Canada to the Gulf. Indeed. It includes all those who may b« affected directly or indirectly. These perils to our emoes commercial world must be removed. How? Precisely as fear is quelled by the association of all the banks in a city in time of Impending or threatening danger. The Imme diate and overwhelming thought is that each bank standing alone all of them must fall, but that all or" them united no on* of them can fail. This i.i the American idea of federation— "united we stand and divided we fall." The fact that all of our hanks are disassociated, separated and unrelated subjects the business of the whole country, our laborers, our manufacturers, our merchants— indeed, all business interests of whatsoever kind— to the ever lurking danger in the. failure of even the weakest of them, since it may for some reason extend Its Influence until panic conditions prevail. Immediately all depositors run upon the hanks, and all the bank* run upon each other. The bank", on the one hand, demand their balances; the banks holding the balances, on the t other hand, refuse to pay them, which is no less I a run on their part, simply because they have pos session. For their refusal to pay results in com pletely breaking down our exchanges, paralyzing trade, breaking up all normal conditions, and "ter minates In loss immeasurable and, suffering inde scribable, i The problem before the people of the United States is peculiarly our own and cannot be solved by simply aping some other nation. We must study our own conditions, and will successfully solve the greatest problem now confronting the whole civ ilized world only by the application to our own peculiar conditions of those fundamental principles which are absolutely unerring in their operation. To preserve and maintain the principle of in dividual banking whicn Is so strikingly peculiar to the United States, ami at the same time secure that str?ngth and protection that are essential to absolute. confidence and an Impregnable defence to American commerce, v.c must accomplish three thing-: First — We ,71'jst unify American banking. Second— We must decentralize our '■•ink credits. Thlr«l — We. must centralize our <r°ld reserve The unification of our hnnking system can be ac complished only through a national ■(•/, which After a thorough study and mature deliberation Shall be ai>:>rov<»l by 'he business and banking In terests of the whole com.try and commend itself to the loyal support of the peonlo as vi ell Such an a.-ta .-t must give sufficient freedom to enable the in dividual banks to efficiently exercise their Impor tant function. it must at the same time carry !imitati»iiP and restrictions In the interest of safety. which, being enforced by thorough supervision, will give th« highest iruiran'ee for continual solvency. It must provide for a common,- central, ample arid R»n»ril gold reserve lirectly related to the total liabilities of ill the ban*--*, and must also provide for a dearer of mutuality of responsibility between the Indivldua 1 units composing the system suf ficient to make loss to the depositor as well as to th note holder Impossible. Neither a government snviiips hank nor a gov ernment guarantee of hank deposits, which are Identical In fact ami principle, should find any place on 'he statute books of our country, whose chief iKSPt. greatest strergth and crowning glory is ; Hie in.lividuulism X our citizenship.

The report shows that North Brother Island Is situated in the bend of the East River, just above the Harlem Kills, and that an additional waterway at this point would materially lessen the dangers to navigation, particularly in thick weather. The present channel between the two Islands is only fifteen feet deep, and the increased size of barges prevents them from using it. They take the main channel, thus interfering •with other traffic.
