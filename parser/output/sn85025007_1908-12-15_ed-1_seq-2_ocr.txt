TUESDAY EVENING, DEC. 15, 1908, A recent issue of the B bical Wotld, a magazine edited by tbe religious pro? fessors of the Chicago Unlvtr.lty School, contains aa editorial defense of the modern scientrfis methods of dealing with the Bible and of extending the gospel. It holds tbat the most effective way ot teaeblng Ohristaoity to the heathen is by means of a physical acd electrical laboratory, and tbat to tbiok eolenlihcally in ooe chamber of tbe mind wbile bowing to authority la another is "to make one's life an internal contra? diction and one's progress bei-tatlcg ead ineffective." Nevertheless,!! says tba'. "the scientific spirit has gone on Its victorious way" nod that more and m re teachers of Christ aoity ure finding tbst "neither truth nor life has anything to fear, but everything to gain, from the most searching investigation, and tbe most resolute thinking find warrant ad courage for such thinking and for courageous doing." I' decVestbat sci? ence ba* become the a'ly of the religion of Christ, and looks for the day "when the church will be no longer joined in unholy alliance with ignorance, but all the forcea tbat make for intelligence ahall be arrayed on the tide of the re? ligion of Jesus " In answer to several inquiries it U stated tbat Coofeder.te veteiasa who are pensioners of the state are exempt from the payment of capitation tax. The whole matter is thus : By all but Con? federate* and union veterans, poll tsx must be paid a* a prerequisite to voting. Unpsid lor three years, the tax must be collected by due process from all against whom it is swated, whether veterans or voters or not, unless the person in ques? tion be a pen? oner of Vie state. The pure food aoddiuu beard has de? cided tbat Libels including tbe pbnne ??Ooa'a-iteed under tbe food and drug act" are mislf .dine, and all new label* after January 1 must show the guaran? tee is by tbe m.aafactare. Most of (he "pure food" labels are a delusion and ? anare as are most of the pure food law*. Tha adulterations now, it is said, are tt bad as they ever were. The fortnightly bulletin ol the Amer? ican Railway Association on the esr sup? ply states that in the two weeks ended Novembet _5 the number of idle cars in the country and od Oacadian roads in? creased by 11,655, making the total sur? plus on tl r> rive 132,82fl. This is s sure indication of continued stsgeatior in business which in greatly to be re? gretted. _ At the Farmers' Institute held at Woodstown, N.

Charles M >;hwab, prealdent of the Bethlehem s eel Cj_.pi.ny, todiy told the ways and means committee some? thing about the steel business. Chair mao Payne reid to r-vhwib a lett-r written to H. C. Frick, May 15, 1899, in which he said th*t they could make rails at Pittsburg for leas than |12 a ton, and asked if tl at was true. ?Yes, at tbat time," answered Smith. "Vfe. could at that time get plenty of men at fl to $1.S6 a i'ay aod one of them would do tbe work t_j?t two men do now. Freight rates were one third lesa than they are tx ay." Then Schwab gave -gores to aho* that the eoe. of ? ton ol ore in Pittsburg now is $4.05, aod the oost of a ton of pig irun, including the ore, is about $14. The present cost of converting pig rm ioto rails was $7.,r>0 a too, S-bwah -nd, making the present cost or rails $2] r>o a too. Representative Pata nm, of New Y rk, firmly expre<-ed bia belief at the White House Uday that 8 cretary Root would not abandon his senatorial prospects to enter Judge Trtf.'a Cabinet. A repo.t to the Stale Depsrmeht from j Consul General Mnaon, at Paris, on the schedules prepared by tbe i arliamentary cuatoms commiaaion, shows tbat tbey are generally higher than formerly on manufsctured products. The few cases in whicb reductions are recommended relate almost exclusively to law or par? tially manufactured materials, wbich are needed in Fiench industries. Tbe Haitian situation haa assumed a much more hopeful aspect, according to advices tbat reached Waahington today. It is understood in Port an Prince tbat General Firmin and Genera' Foucbsrd have mate an arrangement with G.neral S moo, aad tbe prediction is now freely male that the latter will become presi? dent of the republic and the former two revolutionary leaders will have import? ant posta under bis administration. Thia removes the prospect of any further rev? olution and cementa the warring elements in the republic. ^_ Anot' *r Mer sage Washington, jc 15.?The following is a synopsis ol spec.a message aent to Congress by tbe president today : In language probably more emphati? cally denunciate r/ than was ever used before in such a document, President Roosevelt today in a special message to Congreaa, anaigned Joseph Pulitzer, of the New York World, in particular and other critics cf theadministration in gen? eral, for their recent charges with re? spect to the purchase ol tbe Panama canal. He characterizes tbe accusations as scurrilous, libelous and false, lu every essential particular; submits documen? tary evidence to support his contentions; brands Mr. Pulitzer by rame as a villi fj-r o' t_e Ami rita i people and declare, his purpose of bringing a governmental action for libel. The message in part, reads as follows: "In view of the constant reiteration of the association that lhere was some corrupt action by, or on behalf of the United States government in coonee ion with tba acquisition of the title of the French Company to the Pan? ama canal aod of tbe repetition of the atc ry that a syndicate of Amer? ican citizens owned either one or both of the Pacama companies, I deem it wise to Bobrnit lo tbe Congress all tbe information I have on tbe subject. These -tories were first brought to my atten? tion as published ina paper in Indianap? olis, called 'The News,' edited by Mr. Delavan Smith. The stories were scur? rilous and libelous ia cbn-acter, and fa si- in every essential particular. Mr. Smith shelters himself behind the ex? cuse that ho merely accepted the state? ments which bsd appeared in a taper published in New York, 'The World,' owned by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer. It ia idle to say that the known char-e'er of Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are. such tlht the statements in tbat paper will be believed by nobody. I therefore lay al! the i*tt< before you.'' Here the president recites tbe various charges including those sg"'_.rt Obarles P. Taft, brother of William Howard Taft, and Douglas Robinson, fbe presi? dent's brother-in-law, of participation ! in the $40,000,000 purchase fund aod proceeds. "These statements sometimes appear? ed in the editorials, sometimes in the news columns, sometimes in the shape of contributions from Individuals, either unknown, or known to be of bad character. They sre false in every partic? ular from tenoning toend. The wicked? ness of tbe slanders is only sop assed by their fatuity. Ho utterly baseless are tbe stories, tbat apparently tbey repre? sent in part merely material collected fr campaign purposes, and in part stories originally concocted with a view jf possible black mail. The inventor of tas story about Mr. Charles P. Taft, for instance, evidently supposed tbat at some period of tbe Pacama purchase, Mr, Vf. H, Taft wa. secretary of war, whereas, in reality, Mr. W. H. Taft never became secretary of war until long after the whole transaction in question bad been closed. The inventor of the story about Mr. Douglas Robin son bsd not taken the trouble to find out the fact tbat Mr. Robinson bad not the slightest connection, directly or indi? rectly, of any kind or sort, witb any phase of ihe Pacarra Iramaction, from begin? ning to end. Now.thess storieSjSS a matter of fact, need no investigation whatever. No shadow of proof has been, or can be, produced in behalf of any of them. They consist simply of a string of in? famous libels. In form they are in part libels upon individuals, upon Mr. Taft and Mr. Robinson, for instance. P> it they are in fact wholly, and in form tartly, a libel upon the United States government. I do not believe we should concern ourselves with the particular individuals who wrote the lying and libelous editorials, articles from corre? spondents or aiticles in tbe news columns. The real t Hander is Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, editor and proprietor of tbe W .ri I. While the criminal uflense of which Mr. Pulitz-r has bean guilty is in form a lir-el upon individual., the great ii jury done ia in blackeoiug tbe good rame bi the Americto people. It should not be left to a private citizen to sue Mr. Pu? litzer for libel. He should be prosecuted for libel by tbe governmental authori? ties. In point'of encouragement of in quity, in point of infamy, or wrong? doing, there is nothing to choose between s public servant who betiays his trust, a public servsnt who is guilty of blsck mail, cr theft, or financial dishonesty of a y kind, and a man guilty as Mr. PalltZ-T bsa beet guilty in this instance, It is therefore a high nstiooal duty to to bring justice this vilifier ol the Amer? ican people, this man who wantonly and wick-dly and without one sbalow of justification aeeks to blacken the char? acter of the reputable private citizen*, and to convict tbe government of his own country in the eyes of the civilized world of wrong doing of the basest and foulest kind when he has not one shadow of justification of any sort or descrip? tion for tbe charge be hss msde. Tue attorney geoeral has under considera? tion tbe form in wbich the proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall be brought."
