Editor, Volume XV, Number 22, 1RON101V. BIO.. THURSDA Y DEC. 15. 1881. President Arthur last Monday nom mated Frederick Frelinghuyaeu, of New Yorkr for Secretary of State, vice Jas. G. Blaine, kicked out. The Ouiteau trial is growing serious and the disgrace of the comedy may yet be relieved by a bit of approved tragedy at the end of the play. We hope. though, for the honor of the Americ an people, Guiteau may be "proved to have been a raving mauiac for ten years prior to the shoot ing. 1 1 1 asawWaw ' A Summary of the President's Message. Tn the first paragraph he tells how sorry the nation is that President Gar field is dead, and that Great Britain is also so sorry that he ordered a salute to be fired to her flag at Yorktown. Our foreignrelations are peaceable and encouraging, except with Turkey, where there is an open question in re gard to the murder of a missionary. It is claimed that our nation has not only secured its own rights, but also rendered valuable aid in settling ques tions arising out of other nations to each other. The attention or Congress is ealled to the need of some 'legislation to dispose of our claims against foreign nations. In regard to finance it reports the total recepts fur the year at $360,782, 292.57; total expended, $260,712,887.59, leaving "a surplus of $100,069,404.98, This has been applied as follows : To the reduction of the national debt in various ways, $85,432,381.05, and to in crease cash iu the Treasury, $14,637, 023.93. It is estimated that for the present year, ending June 30th, 1882, the receipts will be $400,000,000, and expenditures $270,000,000, leaving a balance of $130,000,000 to pay debt al ready existing. The message opposes the issuingof geld or silver certificates, and recommends a restraint en nation al banks regard to retiring their notes without reasonable notice. It appears that the balance of trade has, in the lust year, turned against us to the extent of $81,168,650 that is to say; we are gettiug ready for a amash. The message recommends the reduc tion of the revenue by exempting from tax everything except tobacco in its various forms and distilled and fer mented liquors, and the manufactur ers and dealers in those articles. In this recommendation, our nation al banking system, based on our na tional debt, petitions Congress for a loager lease of life, under the pretense of relieving the people. The message practically lets the tar iff alone. In respect to the army, it recom mends no increase in the number of officers, but would increase the number of enlisted men to 30,000. The message very cautiously recom mends improvement of the navigation f the MiHs'sfiippi river; and recom mends the reconstruction and improve ment of our navy, regardless of expense; in which recommendation the contract lobly sends up n petition. The Post Office Department is said to be in excellent condition; and the proseeution of the Star Route thieves is said to have been very strongly urg ed on Government officials. The President not being able to fathom the report' of the Secretary of the Interior, sends the whole thing to Congress. The message recommends Congres sional aid to education, and a liberal appropriation for the support of schools among the Indians. The recommendations in regard to polygamy amount to nothing. In regard to civil-service reform, the President quotes largely from his own letter of acceptance, and explains it, and promises to adhere to it. But ex planation does net explain. The message deplores the decline of the American shipping interest; fans to account for it, and makes no sug gestions; and leaves immigrants to the oare of Congress, and turns over the District of Columbia to the same prov idence. And in respect to legislation to ascertain the vote for Presidential electors, and determining the official Inability of the President, the message is non-committal. The Ironton Common School. It is not proposed to say how long, broad or high the school house Is; how many bricks are in the walls; how many square yards of plastering uoon them; how many windows ad squares of glass admit ute light; now many slates are on the roof; or how many dollars, cents snd mills the whole thing cost. Let It suffice to say that the building Is very solidly and artistically constructed of well moulded aad completely burned bricks; that It is roofed with good slsts; that IU four echool-rooms axe sufficiently capacious, are well lighted, comfortably warmed, splendidly nested and have a good supply of blackboard. To these facts it mar be added that, when the school grounds have bees neatly fitted up and fenced, and well filled wltb shads trees, and a well dug, counting the interest on the money already expended, the heart of ten thousald dollars Kill be broken. The bulld- S. D. AKE, og Is aa honor to Southeast Missouri, and compares very f avorably with those at Slrm and Boll, and It such a (treat advance on anything hitherto attained In this district that Suggestion is silenced and Criticism dls armed. Into three of Us school-rooms the district has damped about one hundred and seventy-five scholars a lively population, whose scholarship is, as a rale, moderate. The task of bringing light oat of darkness, and order ont of confusion, has been assigned to Mr. C B. Isham. as PrincIiaL and MU Schneider and Miss Msrkham, as assistants. All the teachers have a new field, because although MissMarkham has taught in the district before it has been reorganized since he did so. So much new material has been added, and the arrangement of the nesr house are so different from those of the old one, that she had to recast her whole school. There Is no lack of either brains or energy among the scholars. The writer has visited the Union schools In Wellsville, Steubenrille, Urban, Betiefon taiue, and Find ley, iu Ohio, Fort Wayne. In dianapolis, Crawfordsvilie, Logans port, and and Montlcello, in Indiana, Nlles, in Michi gan, and Lyons, Clinton, sad DeWitt, in Ion a. Aided by five assistants, he has taught a school with an average attendance of 550 scholars, and has been a teacher in several common schools besides. The first requisite in a successful teacher is a capacity for organization, for getting into shape and working order the material put Into his hands. The organization of a Mis souri school is a work by itself. In respect to this capacity the present teachers in the Ironton school stand very fair. As there can not be any other sound basts of classification in a school but scholarship, as the school pro- grogresses there must oe lome swapping around of papils among the teachers. All the teachers evidently understand the demands of their work, and are devoting their attention to elementary Instruction in the various branches, and are putting Doth their heads and hearts Into the work. With a very inti mate knowledge of ;the status of the Ironton district, the belief Is expressed that, in re spect to education, It stauds In the dawn of better future. Whilst there is a keen appre elation of, and an entire willingness to do, justice to the various merits and excellencies of the different teachers, the school has been considered as a unit, as that is the relation In which it stands to the public. An effective Teachers' Institute would great ly promote education in Iron county. T. C Bismarck Happenings- BY

Tue Snu of 1868 was a newspaper of a new kind. It discarded man? of the toons, and a multitude of the superfluous word and phrases of ancient Jom nellsm. It undertook to rt port In a fresh, succluct, uncoo veutloual way all the newsof tne world, omitting no evot of human interest, and commenting upon affairs with tbe fearlessness of absolute independence. Tne succ-sa of this experiment was the success ol The Sun. It effected a permanent ebauire In the style of American newspapers. Every important Journal estebllsbed In this country in the dozeu years past has been mod fled and bettered by the force of the .un' example. The Sun of 1843 will be the aameouupoken, truth telling, and interesting newspaper. By a liberal aae of the means which an abun dant prosperity affords, we shall make it better than ever before. We shall print all the news, putting It Into readable shape, and measuring Its lmpo'tance. not by the traditional yardstick, but by Its real Interest to the people. Distance from Print InirJHouse Square Is not tbe flrat couiUerat.ou with The Sun. Whenever anything happen worm reporting we get tne particulars, wtietn er It hsonens In Brooklvn or In Bokhara. In politics we have decided opinions: and are accustomed to express them in 1 tnguage that can be understood. We say what we think about mm and events. That habit Is the only secret of The Sun's political course. The Weekly Sun gathers Into eight pages the best matter of the dally isrues. An Agri cultural Department of unequalled merit, full market report, and a liberal proportion of lit erary, scientific, and domestic Intelligence complete The Weekly Sun, and make It the nest newspaper for tne farmer's household evr printed.

MISSOURI REPUBLICAN. PROSPECTUS. This paper, usually called the St. Louis Republican, published in the great traus-Mls-sisslppi emporium, was established In 1808, whilst the now flourishing State of Missouri was a small territory and St. Louis a mere out post, tbe headquarters of a lew Uovernmeut officers and Iuaiau traders. Tbe Republican bus steadli v increased from a diminutive sheet. printed weekly aud containlbg but little more than local aud unimportant events, to a rep resentative Aim ricau Journal, holding place in the front rauk Of tbe great newspapers of t he world, lis history is tne history of the neat and south in all enterprises, aud in all tne ma terial, political and social Interests el the coun try. It Is tbe expoueut of the views of that class of citizens who seek to have the Government conducted upon Democratic, popular and con servative principles, and In that regard Is tbe organ of the most lntellitrent snd thoughtful mirdsof tbe extensive reiclon in which it circu lates. It reaches a s reat maloritv of pust-of&c- es throughout Missouri, llliuola, Kansas. Iowa and At Kansas, and is disseminated more or less Isnrely in every other State and Territory, be sides going to an important points m aurope. Iu various editions reach over one hundred thousand homes, counting-rooms, stores snd offices; this fact growing out of a steady and uniform gruwth, as population has increased and mall facilities expended. Its readers are the "bone and sinew" of tbe country, well In formed snd Influential. The Regubllcan, from tbe care with wsica it Is edited and conducted, the enterprise manifested In the collection of news from all quarters. Its consistency In tbe advocacy of principles oesnng upon tne proxpemy ana well being of the people, has built up a cir culation not to be estimated merely by Its numerical irreatness. The Republican la published by men cnieny who bsve grown up from boyhood in the busi ness, snd hsve made the printing of a news aaner the stndvof their 11 ves. It Is practically impossible that any event of resl Importance could occur anywnere on tne civiuieu iirm and not be published in the Republican before the rising of the next sun. With tbe means and the purpose to publish all the news, read era of lte columns will have no reason to look further for a history of ths times. To those engaged in commerce, ano inaeea all who buy or sell, mm concerned in what to bought and sold, tne Republican will eup niv all nrceasarv and desirable Information so far as it can be found In tbe most comeolete and careful commercial reports from every im portant trsde centre and stock marset in tne world.
