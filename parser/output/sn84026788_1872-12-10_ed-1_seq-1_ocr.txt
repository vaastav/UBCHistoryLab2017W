PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE^ Uo the Senate and House of Representa tives: In transmitting to you this, my fourth an Xbal message, it is with thankfulness to the Oiver of all good that as a nation we have been blessed for the past year with peace at home peace abroad and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few people. With tho exception of the recent devasta ting fire which swept from the earth with a ~ i!u -a3 'C wero millions of atwumolated' wealth in tho city of Boston, there has been overshadowing calamity within the vearto ^^^9 gratifying to note how, lite their fel low-citizens of Chicago under similar circum stances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under their misfortunes, and the prospect that their energy and perseverance overcome all obstacles and show the same prosperity 800n that ,hey wou]d ha(J nQ d-g_ aster befallen them. Otherwise we have been ?f; /r0.? pestilence, war and calamities, which often overtake nations; and, as far as human judgment can penetrate the future no cause seems to exist to threaten our pres r6ot peace.

TIIE GENEVA TRIBUNAL. ^.,rrenKC7?reSSadjourDed in J,>nn Iwt a ?fjuestion had been raised by Great Britain and was then pending, which for a time se riously imperiled the settlement, by friendly arbitration, of the grave differences between J'!l;jrerTe,n\am! tI,at ?f 1,er Bn'aonic majesty, which by tho treaty ot Washington had been referred to the tribunal of arbitra ting at GeneVBi in Switzer land. 1 he arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeopardized the whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the ?two nations in most unhappy relations to each ' ,n a entirely satisfactory to . Kovernmcnt, and in accordance with the Views and policy which it had maintained.? 1 he tribunal, which had convened at Geneva on C0D<;IU'lcjf i,S Iabnrious session , 1^th ay.,oi, September last, on which day, having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty t0 award a mm in gross, it made its decision whereby it awarded tho sum of fifteen millions five hun dred thousond dollars in gold as tho indem nity to be paid by Groat Britain to the Uni ted States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred tomm consideration. This decision d'SPTeS ?f * t,andine difference between the two government*, and in con nection with auother award made by the Ger man Lmperor under a reference to him by the same treaty, leaves these two govern- ! ments without a shadow upon the friendly re- I ations, which it is my sincere hope may for- ! ever remain equally unclouded.

I consequently recommend the creation of a board of commissioners for the purpose. THE SAN JUAN BOUNDARY. By the thirty-fourth artiole of the treaty of "Washington the respective claims ol tho Uni ted States and of Great Britain in their eon~ struction of the treaty of tho 15th of June, 1846, defining tho boundary line between their respective territories were submitted to the arbitration on an award of his majesty the Emperor of Germany to decide which of those 'claims is most in accordance with the true in terpretation of the treaty of 1846. His Ma jesty the Emperor of Germany haviug been pleased to undertake the arbitration, has the earnest thanks of this government and of tho people of tho United States for the labor, pains and care which he has devoted to the considcratiop of this long-pending difference. I have caused an expression of my thanks to bo communicated to his Majesty. Mr. Bans croft, the representative of this government at Berlin, conducted the case and prepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability that his past service justified the public in expecting at his hand, as a member of the cabinet at the date of tho trea ty which has given rise to the discussion bos tween the two governments. As the minister to Great Britain when the construction now pronounced unfounded was first advanced and as the agent and representative of the gov ernment to present the case and to receive the award he has bee? associated with the question in all of its phases,. ?ud in every Btage has manifested a patriotic- zeal and ear-, neftness in maintenance of the dlsim of tho United States, lie ;3 eo^illedcredit for the succeea which has attended his sub. mission. After a patient investigation of the case, and of the statements of each party, his Majesty the Emperor, on the 21st day of Oc tober last, signed his award in writing, de rV?R-,th,aVhe C'almS ?e the government of the United States that the boundary line be tween th* temtories of her Brittanic Majesty and the United States should bo drawn anc?oaw?th thITfar?

Copies of the case presented on behalf of each government, and of the statement in re ply of each, and a translation of the award are transmitted herewith. This award cons firms the Umted States in their claim to the cmS?"* Aj?vPCl'g0 0f ialarid3 between the continent and Vancouver's Island, which, for years, ever since the confrsflT ?f, fhe treaty- G^at Britain has contested, and leaves us for the first time in ti e history 0f the United States as a nation without a question of disputed boundary be rw ii-(r-territ?ry and tb? possessions of Great Britain on this continent.

With France, our earliest ally, Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United States, Germany, with whose government and people wo have so many causes of friendship and so many common sympathies, and the other powers of Europe, our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms. Since my las-t annual message the exchange has been made of tho ratification of a treaty with the Austro-Hungarian empire relating to natu ralization ; also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting consuls and trade marks, also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway re lating to naturalization, all of which treaties have been duly proclaimed. 

STATISTICAL CONORESS AMERICAN CEN? .. TENNIAI., ETC. Congress at its last session having made an appropriation to defray the expenses of com missioners on the part of the United States to the International Statistical Congress at St. Petersburg, the persons appointed in that character proceeded to their destination and attended the sessions of the Congress. Tbeir report shall, in due season, be laid before you. This Congress meets at intervals of about three years, and has held its sessions in sev eral of tho countries of Europe. I submit to your consideration tho pro priety of extending an invitation to the Con gress to hold its next meeting in the United States. The centennial celebration to be held in 187G would afford an appropriate occasion for such meeting. Preparations are making for the international exposition to be held during the next year at Vienna on a scale of very great magnitudo. The tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization and of the elevation of industry and of labor, and of the increase of human happiness, as well as of greater intercourse and good will between nations. As this ex* position is to be the first which will have been held in eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be ready to avail themselven of the oppor tunity for the presentation of their produc tions, if encouraged by proper aid and protec At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this government at the ex position The authority thus given has been exercised, but in the absence of any appro priation, there is danger that the important benefits winch the occasion offers will, in a large degree, be lost to citizens of the United oiuies. I commend this subject especially to vonr consideration, and recommend that an ade quate appropriation bo made for the purpose. To further aid American exhibitors at the \ tenna exposition I would recommend, in ad dition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantio cities and Trieste, or the most cons venicnt port to Vienna and back, their arti cles for exhibition. MEXICAN AFFAIRS. Since your last session the President of the i lexican Kepublio, distinguished by his hi?h character and by his flervice to his country, has died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the peo ple, a proof of confidence on their part in his patriotism and wisdom, which, it is believed, will bo confirmed by the results of his admin istration. It ,s particularly desirable that nothing should be left undone by the govern ment of either republic to strengthen their relations as neighbors and friends It is much to bo regretted that many law-, less acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border between our terri tory and that of Mexico, and that complaints of wrongs to American citizens in various parts of the country are made. The revolu tionary condition in which the neighboring republic has so long been involved has" in some degree contributed to this disturbance. It is to bo hoped that, with a more settled rule of order throush the republic which may e expected from the present government, the acts of which j u.st complaint is made will cease. ?Itie proceedings of the commission under the con vention with xAIexieo of the 4th of | ?July, 18G8 on tho subject of claims, have unfortunately been.checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken by the two government*, which, it is believed, will prove successful. The commissioners appointed pursuant to the joint resolution of Congress of the 7th of ni to inquire into depredations on the Jexan frontier, have diligently made investi gations ,n that quarter. Their report upon the subject will be -communicated to you. i heir researches were necessarily incomplete partly on account ot the limited appropri ation made by Congress. Mexicb, on the part ot that government, has appointed a similar commission to investigate these outrages It IS not announced officially, hut the press of that country state that the fullest investi-a tinn is desired, and that tho co-operation^ of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. 1 thorefore recommend that a special appropriation he made at the earliest day prac ticable to enable the commissioners on the cart of heUnited States to return to their labors without delay. 

CUBA. It is with resrrct that I have ?<rain to an nounce a continuance of tho disturbed con dition of the Island of Cuba. i\? advance towards the pacification of the discontented part of the population has been made, whilst the insurrection has gained no advantage, and exhibits no more of the elements of power or of the prospects of ultimate success, than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has not succeeded in its reprcs eion, and the parties staud apparently in the same relative attitude which they have occu p.cd for a long time past. The contest has lasted now for more than four years Were its scene at a distance from our neighborhood we might bo indifferent to its result/although humanity could not be unmoved by many "of its incidents, however they might occur It is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt that the continued main tenance of slavery rn Cuba is among the strongest inducements to tho continuanco of ] the strife. A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms in the administration of government in Cuba j could not fail to advance the restoration of j peacc and order It is greatly to bo hoped that the present liberal government of Spain will voluntarily adopt the law of emancipation which was passed more than two years since and has remained unexecuted in the absence or regulations for its enforcement. It was but a feeble step towards emancipa ion, but it was tho recognition of right and was hailed as such and exhibited Spain in harmony with the sentiments of humanity and of justice and in sympathy with the other powers of the Christian and ^civilized world N ithin the past few weeks the .regulations for carrying out the law of emancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sin cerity of the intention of the present govern ment to carry into effect the law of 1870. I have not failed to urge the consideration j of the wisdom of the policy and the justice I ot a more effective svstem for th* Al,nli?i?? I the great evil which oppresses a race, and continues a bloody and destructive contest close to our own border, as well as the expe diency and the justice of conceding reforms, the propriety of which is not questioned.? Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of tho most ac tive causes of the continuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claim ing to be such, are large holders in (Juba of what is there claimed as property, but which is forbidden and denounced by the laws of the United States. They are thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own laws, contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. In my last annual message I referred to this sub ject, and I again recommend such legislation as may be proper 'to denounce, and if pot prevent, at least to discourage Anzerican citi zens from holding or dealing in slaves. It is gratifying to announce that the ratifications of the convention concluded under the auspices of this aovernment between Spain on the one part and the allied Republics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armistice, have been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith submitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace be tween the 6ame parties. 

'SOUTH AMERICA. ? The differences which at one time threatened the maintenance of peace between-Brazil and the Argentine ifepnblie, it is hoped, are in the way of satisfactory adjustment. With, these States, as with the republic of Central and South America, we continue to maintain tho most-friendly relations. It is with regret, however, I announce that the government of Venezuela liaa made no further payments on account of the awards under in the convention of the 25th of At>ril 1866. F ' That republic is understood to bo now al most if not quite, y>an<juilized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time in provid ing: for the unpaid balance of its debt to the United States, which, having originated in injuries to our citizens by the Venezuela au thorities, and having been acknowledged, pur suant Jo a treaty, in the most solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin and contracted in a different manner. This subject is again recommended to the attention of Congress, for such action as may be deemed proper. JAPAN AND CHINA. ? Our treaty relations with Japan remain un changed. ^An imposing embassy from that in teresting and progressive nation visited this country daring the year just passing, but being unprovided with tho power for signing of a convention in this country, no conclusion in that direction was reached. It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinions which took place during their stay in the country has led to a mutual appreciation of the interests which may be promoted when the re vision of the existing treaty shall be under taken. In this connection I renew my recom mendation of one year ago that to give im portance and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China and to further aid in retaining the good opin ion of these people, and to secure to the Linited States its share of the commerce des tined to flow between these nations and the balance of the commercial worid, an appro priation be made to supportat least four Amer ican youths in each of those countries to servo a9 a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an eo.uality with the representa tives ot Great Britain and of some other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for inter preters and translators upon natives of these countries who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of em ployees in foreign business houses, or the ins terpreters to other foreign ministers. I renew tho recommendation made on a previous oc casion for the transfer to the interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the terri tories with which the department of State is now charged by law or by custom. RELIEF OP DISTRESSED SEAMEN. Congress, from the beginning of the gov ernment, has wisely made provision for the re lief of distressed seameo in foreigu countries. No similar provision, however, has hitherto been made for the relief of citizens in distress abroad, other than seamen. It was understood to be the custom with ofher governments to authorize its consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropriation to carry it into effect are reeommende 1 in the case of citizens of the United State destitute or sick under such circumstances. Tt is well known that sueh citizens ro-ort to fnreien countries in great number. Though most of them are able to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some who, through accident or otherwise, become penniless, and have no friends at home able to succor them Persons in this situation munt either perish, cast themselves upon tho charity of foreigners, or be relieved at the private charge of our own officers, who usually, even with the. most be nevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare for such purposes. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be granted, care will be taken to carry the beneficence of Congress into effect, that it shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed. TREASURY. The moneys received and covered into tho Treasury duriog the fiscal year ended June 30th. 1872, were: From customs, S216.370, 286 77 ; from sales of public lands. 82.575, 714 19; from internal revenue, 8130,642, 177 72 ; from tax on national bank circular lion, &o., 86.523,386 39 ; from Pacific rail- j way companies, S749.861 87 ; from customs i fines, &c., 81,136.442 34 ; fees, consular, 1 patent, land. &o., S2,284.095 92 ; frojn mis- j cellaneous sources, 84,412,254 71 ; total or- ! dinary receipts, 8364,694.229 91 ; from pre- j miums on sales of coin.

From the foregoing statement it appears that the net re duction of the principal of the debt daring the fiscal year ended June SOtb, 1872, was 899,960,253 54. The source of the reduction is as follows: Net ordinary receipts during the year, ?364, 694,229 91; net ordinary expenditures, in cluding interest on the publio debt, 8270,~ 550.695 91; total, leaving a surplus revenue of 894,734,534; add the amount of receipts from premium on sales of gold in excess ol the premium paid on bonds purchased, 82, 454,370. ?9; add the amout of the reduction of the cash balance at the close of the year as compared with the same at the commenoe maqt of .the year 33.371,348 65 ; total S99, 060,253 54. This statement treats solely -of the principal of the public debt. JBy the monthly statement of the public "debt which i adds-jt0gether the principal, interest dae and unpaid, and interest accrued to date not due, and deduct the cash in the treasury as ascer tained ob the 4ay of publication, the reduc tion was 8100,544.491.2S.

From March 1, 1S72. to November 1, 1372, (eight lnontha) 64,047,237 84 Total 8363,696,999 87 With a great reduction of taxation by the acts of Congress at its last session, the ex penditures of the government in collecting the revenue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful, however, whether any further reduction of so vexatious a burthen upon any people will be practicable for the present. At all events as a measure of justice to the holders of 'the nation's cer tificates of indebtedness, I. would recommend that no more legislation be had on this sub ject, unless.it be to correct errors of omission in the present laws, until sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet the currenc expenses of tho government, pay interest on the public debt, and provide for its sinking fund established by law. The preservation of our national credit is of the highest importance. Next in import ance tr> this comes a solemn duty to provide a national currency of fixed, unvarying value, as cm pared with gold, and as soon as practica ble, having duo re sard fi.r the interests of the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade and commerce, convertible into gold at par. 

AVAR DEPARTMENT. Tho report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the. War Department for the_ fiscal year ending June 30, 1S71. to be ?35,199,991 82, and for the fiscal year ending June 29, 1S72. to he S35.372.157 20. show ing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of ?427.834 02. Tho estimates for military appropriations'for the next fiscal year ending June 30, 1S74, are ?33,801,37S *78. In the estimates of the chief of engineers are sub mitted separately for fortifications, river and harbor improvements, and for public buildings and grounds, and the \\ ashiogton aqueduot. -The affairs of the breedmntt's Durenn have all been transferred to the War Department, and regulations have been put iu execution for the speedy payment of bounty, pay, &c., duo colored soldiers properly coming under that bureau. All war accounts for money and property prior to 1871 have been cxaminod and transmitted to the treasurer for fiual set tlement. During the fi-cal year there has been paid for transportation on railroads over ?1,300, 000, of which 8800.857 was over the. Psefic road; for transportation by water ?626 373 52, and by stage 548.975 S4, and for the purchase of. transportation animals, wagons, hire of teamsters. Sep., ?924.650 65. About ?370,000 have beeu collected from Southern railroads during tho year, leaving about ?4, 000,000 still due. The quartermaster has ex amined and transmitted to the accounting of ficers for settlement S367.172 72 of claims by loyal citizens for quartermasters' stores taken during the war. Subsistence supplies to the amount of ?89, 048 12 have been issued to Indians. Tho annual average mean strength of the army .was 24,101 white and 2,494 colored soldiers. 1 he total deaths for the year reported were 367 white and 54 colored. The distribution of the medical and surgical history of the war is yet t" be ordered by Congress. There ex ists an absolute necessity for a medical corps of the full number established bv act of Con gress of July 28, 1866. there being now 59 vacancies, and the number of successful can didates rarely exceeds eight or ten in any one year. The river and harbor impromements have been carried on with energy and econo my. Though many are only partially com pleted. the results have saved to commerce many times the amount expended. The. in crease of commerce with greater depth of channels, greater seenritv in navigation, and the saving of time, adds millions to tho wealth of the country and increases the resources of the government. The bridge across the Mississippi river at Rock Island has been completed. The proper site has been determined upon for the bridge at Laeross. The able and exhaustive report made by the commission appointed to inves tigate the Sutro tunnel' has been tranimetted to Congress. The observations and reports of the 6ignal office have been continued. Sta tions have been maintained at each of the principal lake, seaport and river cities. Ten additional stations have been established in the Unit*'! States, and arrangement? have been made for an exchange of reports with Canada, and a similar exchance of observa tions is contemplated with the West India islands. The favorablo attentton of Congress is in vited to the following recommendations of the * Secretary of War: A discontinuance of the 1 appointment of extra lieutenants to serve as j adjutants and quartermasters; the adoption j of a code providing specific penalties for well- J defined offenses, so that inequality of sentences adjudged by conrt martinis may be adjusted ; the consolidation of amounts under which ex penditures are made ; and, as a measure of economy, a reappiopriation of the money for ; the continuation of a depot at San Antonio, ' the title to the site being now perfected ; a i special act placing the cemetery at the city of ' Mexico on the same basis as other national ? cemeteries; authority to purchase eites for j military posts in Texas. The appointment of commissary sergeants ] from non commissioned officers as a measure i for securing the better care and protection of j supplies ; an appropriation for the publication ! of the catalogue and tables of the anatomical ; section of the aVmy medical museum ; a re- \ appropriation of the amount for the maoulac- | ture of breech-loading arms. Should selec tion be so delayed by the.board of officers as 1 . = . - to leave the former appropriation unexpended 1st-the olose of the fiscal year; the sale of saoh arsenals east of the Mississippi as can be | spared, and the proceeds applied to the estab : lishment of one large arsenal of construction i and repair upon the Atlantic coast, and the i purchase of a suitable site for a proving and experimental ground' for -heavy ordnance ; the j abrogation of laws which deprive inTeutors in the United States service from- deriving any benefit from their inventions; the repeal of the law prohibiting promotions in the staff corps; a continuance of the work upon the coast defenses; of the repeal of the seventh section of the act of July 13, 1866, taking from en gineer soldiers the per diem granted to other troops; a limitation of -the time for the pre sentation of old war .claims for subsistence supplies under net of July 4, 1864, and a modification in the modn.of the selection of cadets for the military academy, in order to enhance the . usefulness of the Academy, which is improved by reason of the large amount of time necessarily ejcpcnJud in mg now ifliore e!oc - IMPftOtfl ' *iL ? ?? during the present sessioiStn various enU, prises.for. the.mora . portatiou of the. constantly increasing surplW of the Western and Southern products to the Atlantic seaboard. The subject is one that will foroe itself npon the legislative branch of the government sooner or later, and I suggest, therefore, that immediate steps be taken to gain all available information to insure equitable and just legis lation. One route, to connect the Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, by waters by the wny of the Ohio and Tennessee river, aud canals and .slack-water navigation to the Savannah and Ocmulgee rivers, has been sur veyed and report made by an accomplished engineer officer of the army. ' Second and third new routes will be proposed for the con* 8idoration of Congress, namely, by an exten> sion of the Kanawha and .lames Rivor canal to the Ohio, and by the extension of the Ches apeake and Ohio canal. 1 am not prepared to recommend government aid to these or other enterprises until it is clearly shown that they are not only of national interest, but that when completed they will be of value commensurate with their cost. That production increases more rspidly than the means of transportation in ou{ coun try has been demonstrated by past experience. That the unprecedented growth in population and products of the . wholo country will re quire additional facilities and cheaper ones, for the moro bulky articles of oomraerce to reaoh tide water .and a market will be de manded in the near future is equally demon strated. I would therefore'suggest thateither n committee or commission be authorized to consider this whole question and to report to Congress at some future day, for its better guidance in legislating on this important sub ject. The railrnads of the country have bee.i rapidly extended during the last few years, to meet the growing demands of producers, and reflect uiuch credit upon the capitalists and managers engaged, in their construction. In addition to these a project to facilitate com merce, by the building of a ship-canal around Niagara Falls on the United States side, which has been agitated for many years, will, no doubt, he called to your attention at this ses sion. Looking to the great future growth of the country and tho increasing demands of commerce, it might be well, while on thij suhjeot. not only to have examined and re ported upon tha various practicable routes for 'connecting the Mississippi with tide water on the Atlantic, but the feasibility of an almost continuous land-locked navigation from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico. Snch a route along our coast would be of great value at all times, and of inestimable value in case of a foreign war Nature has provided the greater part ?of this route, and the obstacles to be overcome are easily within the skill of the engineer.? I have not allnded to this subjoet with tho view of having any further expenditure of public roonoy at this'time than may be ne cessary to procure and place all the necessary information before Congress in an authentic form, to enable it hereafter, if deemed prac ticable and wnnby. to legislate on the subject without delav. - ' *r
