Yuan Shi Kai, proj-'idt nt of the Chinese republic, has acct-ptfd the throne of China tendered to him by the council of state. Acting as a parliament, the council of state today canvassed the vot the question of a change in the form of government of China to a monarchy and found That the votes of 1,993 representatives out of 2,04 3 qualified to vote on the proposition wre favor able to change. The council of state immediately pent to Yuan Shi Kai a petition urging him to accept the throne.

COUNCIL Munition Strike Prolie Breaks j Open Labor Meeting. ! German Sympathizers Accused of Taking Control. X w Y r ; -k . Dec. 1 1 . A qua r r e 1 which rent labor's national peact council into two antagonistic factions was stated today by federal officials to have been largely responsible for the uncovering of an alleged conspir acy involving Franz Von Rintelen instigate strikes in munition factories. According to this statement a num ber of members of the council joined the organization believing it was a body formed to work impartially In the interests of peace. Later they dis covered, it is said, that an inner rim of Cierman sympathizers and agent of Yon Rintelen was really in control and intended to use the council as a means to further the strike propa ganda. When the government started its investigation into the activities of Von Rirteb-n. several men. who had been officials of the peace council and hao resigned, placed at the disposal of fed eral authorities information regarding the inner working of the council. L. I. Straube, secretary of the coun cil, is said to have been one of these mn. He is due in New York from Chicago tomorrow and will be Ques tioned by I'nited States Attorney Mar- shall.

RO TE TAKES E UNDER urn President Yuan Shl-KaU AMERICAN CHINESE TO OPPOSE THRONE San Francisco, Cal.. Dec. 11. Tong King Chong. president of the Chinese Republic association here, the con trolling body of thousands of similar organizations in rsorth and South i America, announced today that pre j liminary measures to oppose the establishment of a Yuan Shi Kai mon 1 archy would be taken at a meeting ! tomorrow. He said the association had considered already the necessity I of raising a large fund to further auch j opposition. 1 r -China, for fiienturli.. under . the Manchu rule, bocame a republic February 12,-1-912, following the revolution of 1911, and after the adoption of a provisional consti tution and the election of Yuan Shi Kai as president under its provision on October 6, 1913, he was inaugurated four days later, on October 10. Indications of plans to revert to the monarchical system were first apparent last August, with the publication of accounts of a meeting of promi nent men in Peking, who formed an association to discuss whether a monarchy was not the best form of government for China. The machinery for obtaining an expression of the nation's opinion of the proposed change having been put into operation, it was announced in Peking, on Novem ber 7, that fifteen of the eighteen provinces had voted in favor of a monarchy. Meanwhile, the entente powers pointed out to China that such a step in the midst of the European war was not desirable as tending to lessen the stability of conditions in the orient. China, however, assured the en tente powers that the government would be able to maintain tranquillity in event a monarchy was re-established. It is now evident that the prot?st from the Japanese government, backed up by Russia and (ireat Bri tain, against the immediate restora tion of a monarchical government has been disregarded. An official man date dated November 1 2, bearing on the representations of the powers re ceived in New York by mail yester day, said : "AccorUihg to the report of the min ister of foreign affairs. Mr. Obata, the Japanese charge d'affaires, has, under instructions of his home gov ernment, tendered friendly advice to the Chinese government, requesting the latter to postpone the adoption of the monarchy to the future on the ground that if the change is brought about too suddenly it may cause un rest in the country, which would jeopardize the interests of the friend ly powers. The possibility of unrest has already been anticipated by the government "The provincial officials, both civil and military, have all replied express ing full confidence In their ability to maintain peace and order."

Supreme Court Decision May Put Them Out of Business. CASE ORIGINATED AT WICHITA Decision of the District Court Has Been Sustained. Other Opinions Handed Down hy Highest Tribunal. Kansas jitney owners lost their fight in the supreme court today, when that body held that drivers of cars may be restricted a:i to streets in the handling of passenger traffic. The case went to the supreme court from Wichita and according to opinions of persons in touch with the case, the plan of fighting the jitneys may be adopted in Topeka and other cities. Under the Wichita case, a jitney driver might operate on streets not traversed by the street cars and pay but a nominal license. Operation on the principal streets of the town, how ever, meant a heavy license. The fee ranged from $25 to $400 a year. The Wichita ordinance was sustained by the Sedgwick county district court and affirmed by the supreme court in an opinion by Justice West. Chief Jus tice Johnston and Justice Porter dis sented. In Wichita it was held that the classification of streets to be used by the jitneys was a proper regulation under the power of the city commis sion. The ordinance virtually put the jitney drivers out of business. It made competition with the street rail way almost impossible under the slia ing scale of license fees. The McKinlcy interes-ts, which own the Wichita street railway, also own the Topeka and Atchison lines. Other street railway and interurban com panies were keenly interested in the suit and the decision today probably will affect jitney owners in every town in Kansas where the motor cars compete with street iilways. While no definite statement has been made, it is believed that an early effort will be m?d secure the passage tf an ordinance in Topeka similar to the Wichita (neasare. Brewers Lose Case.

The following report of these operations was issued at the war office here today: "The French concentrated near Petrovo part of their troops from Demiri-Kapu and Gievgeli.

COMPANY WANTS MORE MONEY SOON Kansas Natural Doesn't Think Increase Is Sufficient. Accept 3-Cent Raise Sow Then Ask for More. "ORDER IS CONFISCATORY" Robert Stone Says Xew Kate Isn't Compensatory. 28-Cent Rate Will Go Into Ef fect This Month. Robert Stone, attorney for the Kan sas Natural Gas company receivers, stated this afternoon that he would recommend the adoption at once of the new gas rate, but would also urge a finish fight for a further increase. He declared that the 28 cent rate un der the order was con f iscatory and that findings of the Bristow commis sion were not in keeping with the evi dence. Mandamus proceedings will prob ably be filed in the stale courts in the next few days. Stone Indicated. It is probable that the gas company will take its troubles at once to the su preme court and will ask for an order instructing Bristow to make further pursuit of his investigations. Stone does not anticipate that the gas com pany will refuse to supply gas under the Zi cent rate. Instead, he says, a fight will be waged to show that the Bristow order was not based on facts or evidence offered in the hearing be fore the former United States senator. Order Confiscatory. "The order Is confiscatory and does not provide a rate that is any way compensatory," was the rather caus tic remark which Stone ventured to day. "For one thing, the statement in the opinion that the field has a future life of twelve years is not borne out by any testimony offered by the gas company or the commission.

London Now Admits That Forces Are Inadequate. INFLICTING HEAVY LOSSES French Artillery Mows Down the Pursuing Hordes. Medical Examination in Eng land Perfunctory Now. Paris, Dec. 11. France and Great Britain decided today to continue the cam paign in the Balkans and agreed on military measures designed to assure the se curity of the expeditionary forces which landed at Sal onika London, Dec. 11 The latest news from the Balkans indicates that the allies are still falling back, but with out suffering the lushes endured on the first days of the retreat, when the pursuing Bulgarians attacked rear guards repeatedly. Paris reports that In these action the French inflicted heavy losses on the pursuers by their artillery fire. The British public received a shock in the form of a Salontki dispatch stating that Gievgeli had been occu pied oy two divisions of German troops. Later reports, however, state that this important position is not yet within the range of the invaders guns. Gievgeli is on the Greek frontier near the Vardar river and commands the railroad north from Saloniki. The town first came into prominence dur ing the- present war as headquarters of th3 typhus hospital of Er. James F. Donrelly, of New York, who died in Nish in February. Forces Are Inadequate. It is generally conceded the present forces of the allies are inadequate to cope with Bulgaria and the central powers whose armies, according to a statement credited to Premier Bados lavoff, of Bulgarian, now number 1 , - 000,000 men. The final day for recruiting under the plan of the Earl of lerby finds no diminution in the" crowds .which besieged the' recruiting 1 station, in the rush medical examination has be come as perfunctory as the signing of the recruit's name and it is expected many of those , who. have come for ward will be rejected when iulea for active service.
