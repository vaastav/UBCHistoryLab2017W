TAX LAW REVISION, ARMENIAN LOAN, STORAGE LAVS, ,PHILLIPINE FREEDOM, URGED BY WILSON ;. , (By Associated Press) 7. WASHINGTON. Dec, 7. President Wilson's annual message to congress fet part follows: TThea I addressed myself to per forming the, duty laid upon the presi dent. Dytheii constitution o present you an annua) report on . the state of the union, I found my thought dom inated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln: "Let us have faith that, right makes might, apd in , that .faith let us dare to do our dutx,'a$ tve; understand It a sentence immortal because it em bodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the 'essential faith of the ration, the faith in which it was con ceived: and the faith and the birth of i nation founded on it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of man It tnfi. an order in which reason and right would take precedence of covet ousness and force, and I believe that 1 express the wish' and purpose of every thoughtful American when I bald that this" sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we t-hould play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influence upon the affairs of the world. Faith Won War. By this faith, and by this faith alone can the world be lifted out of its pres ent confusion and despair. It was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the beginning of the end of the war came when the German people themselves, face to face with the con science of the world, and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against rent year. . It is obvious that thesis large payments have already seriously limited the government's progress in retiring the floating debt. Simplify Taxes, Closely connected with this, it enema tn trie is thp TieresKitv for an I immediate consideration of the revi sion of aur tax laws. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has be come as immediate necessity. These taxes performed an indispensable serv ice during the war. The need for their simplification, however, is very great, in order to save the taxpayer incon venience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain and definite. It is my privilege to draw to the at tention of Congress for very sympa thetic consideration the problem of providing adequate facilities for the care and treatment of former mem bers of the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled as the result of their participation in the war. The heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they patriot icaly rendered the nation. Their re ward will lie rather in realization of the fact that they vindicated the rights of their country and aided in safeguarding civilization. The na tion's gratitude must be effectively re vealed to them by the most ample provision for; their medical care and treatment, as well as for their voca tional training and placement. Complete Program. The time has come when a more complete program can be formulated and more satisfactorily administered for their treatment and training and I earnestly urge that the Congress the wrong that their government was: give the matter its early consideration, attempting to perpetrate. I think, I The secretary of the treasury and therefore, that it is true to say that the board for vocational education this was the faith which won the war. I will outline in their annual reports Certainly this is the faith with which I proposals covering medical care and our gallant men went into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. Need of Democracy. This is the mission upon which de mocracy came into the world. Demo cracy is an assertion of the right of the Individual to live and be treated justly, as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy his equality among his fellows in the matter of right and privilege, and I think we all Realize that the day has come when democracy is being put upon its final test. There are two ways in which the United States can assist to accom plish this. great object: First, by of fering the example within her own borders of the will and power of de mocracy to make and enforce laws which are unquestionamly just and which are equal in their administra tion laws which secure the full right of labor and yet at the same time rafeguard the integrity of property and particularly of that property which is devoted to the development of indus try and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world. Second, by standing for right and justice as to wards individual nations. The law of democracy is for the protection of the weak, and the Influence of every de mocracy in the world should be for the protection of the weak nations, the nation which is struggling toward its right and towards its proper recog nition -end privilege in the family of nations. Budget System. Recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water, and has given promise, 1 venture to say, of early completion, only in our own for tunate country. It sems to me that the first step towards providing this is to supply ourselves with a system atic method of handling our estimates and expenditures and bringing them to the point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our in come or necessitate unreasonable tax ation, in other words, a workable bud get system; namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be in the hands of a single body, such as each house of the congress but also that 'this body should be brought into such cooperation with the depart ments of the government and with the treasury of the United States as would enable it to act upon a com plete conspectus of the needs of the government and the resources from which it must draw its income. Finances Improve. The nation's finances have shown marked improvement during the past year. The total ordinary receipts of $G.0'J 4.000,000 for the fiscal year 1020, e xceeded tlioe for 11)19 by $1,512,000,-1 000, while the total net ordinary ex penditures decreased from $1S, 51 1,000,- 000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross public flobt, which reached its highest point' on August. 21, 1919, when it was $26, 596,000,000, had dropped on November ;.0, 1920, to $M,173,000.0S0. There has also been a marked decrease in hold ings of government securities by the banking institutions of the country as well as in the amount resrves held by the federal reserve banks secured by government war obligations. This fortunate result has relieved the banks and left them freer to finance the needs of agriculture, industry and commerce. It has been due in large part, to the reduction of the public debt, specially of the floating debt, but more particularly to the improved distribution of government securities among permanent investors. Economy Necessary. T cannot over-emphasize the neces sity of economy in government ap propriations and expenditures and the rvoidance by the congress of practices which take money from the treasury by indefinite or revolving fund ap propriations. The estimates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were author ized by the "last congress, in addition to the amounts shown in the usual compiled statements of appropriations. This strikingly illustrates the Im portance of making direct and specific appropriations. . The relation between 1 he, current receipts and current ex penditures of the government during the present fiscal year, as well as dur ing the last half of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the extraordin ary burdens thrown upon the treasury by the transportation act, in connec tion with the return of the rauroaas to nrlvate control. Over $600,000,000 has already been paid to the railroads under this act $350,000,000 during me present flscol year; and it is estimated that" further payments aggregating imssibly $650,000,000 must still be mfde to the railroads during the cur- lusion had ben made, they had proved to be unsuccessful and the city had not been injured. , Mr. Reller said he was not in favor of delay. "The firms that have been accused of crooked dealing have not been able to carry this through, and they are not to receive the bids. If we put the matter off longer there is little doubt but that we will be severely criti cised," Mr. Reller stated. Council Favors Progress. All the councilmen then arose in or der and expressed their opinion on the matter, all of them agreeing lhat since Mr. Reller's presentation of the problem it seemed that the best thing to do was to go ahead. The first two readings of the ordi nance allowing the city to borrow $100,000 during the next year in antici pation of current expenses of the Mu nicipal Light plant was passed on the recommendation of Mr. Perk, expert accountant of the city. This money will be used to pay back money spent in 1920 for additions and betterments, being borrowed only as needed, and re turned out of the revenues of the plant Lack of Civic Interest Scored by Prof. Lindley Lack of interest on the part of re sponsible citizens was given as the cause of present conditions in city af fairs, by Professor Harlow Lindley, of Earlham college, speaking before the Rotary club at their weekly luncheon, Tuesday noon. People can get any thing they want if they take the in terest and work hard enough for it, was the opinion of the speaker. "The breakdown of the municipal government of the cities of the United States has been the one thing criti cized by those capable of criticizing," said Mr. Lindley. "The democracy of our federal government is a matter of pride and its success is a marvel by students of government, but the appli cation of the principles to cities has failed."! Home rule means only the freedom of a city to manage its own affairs.

ASKS FOR EXPLANATION. (By Associated Press) WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Secretary Baker was asked today by the house military committee to appear before it Friday and explain why the war department has recruited an army ol more than 190,000 men. were referred to committees. rehabilitation which I am sure will engage your earnest study and com mand your most generous support. It would also be most serviceable if it were provided that all goods re leased from cold storage for interstate j shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or, market price at which they went into; storage in order that the purchaser ; might be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it i would be very serviceable to the pub-! lie if all goods destined for interstate j commerce were made to carry on j every packing case whose form made ; it possible, a plain statement of the j price at which they left the hands of , the producer. I respectfully call your attention to the recommendation of the message referred to with regard to a federal license for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce. Suggests Loan. In response to what I believe to be impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the United States, I earn estly suggest that the congress author ize the treasury c" he United States to make to the stiuggling government of Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the allied governments during the war. Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the Phil lipine Islands have succeeded in main taining a stable government since the last action of congress in their behalf, and have thus fulfilled the condition set by the congress as precedents to a consideration of granting independ ence to the islands. I respectfully submit that this precedent having been fulfilled it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them the independence which they so honorably covet. I have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations, gentle men, as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith In which I was bred, and which it is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of Amer ica, the faith of the future, and of all the victories which await national action in the days to come, whether In America or elsewhere. Mrs. Johnson Discusses the Influence of Rubens The influence of Rubens on 18th centurp painting in France was the subject of an interesting talk given by Mrs. Charles M.
