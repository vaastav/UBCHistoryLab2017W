THE SEMI-WEEKLY MESSKNGER: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1897 DELINQUENT TAX PAYERS NOT INDICTABLE TILIj AFTER TIME FOil LEVY AND 'SALE .Floors of the Capitol Badly Decayed-Bishop Cheshire' Address to Methodist Confrr ence liutltir Greatly Worried Forcing Pajmtnt of Delinquent Taxes six Politi cal Parties The Lyuchitesat Southport, No Compromises in the Next Campaign , . Messenger Bureau, Raleigh, N. C, Dece-m'bcr 2. Tire supreme court decides, in the case of the state ag-ainst Jones, from liockinffham, that under sections &2 and 53 of the new revenue act it is not Che duty of the sheriff to make rerxrt of tar delinquents to the court, as pro vided for by this law, until after the day of levying and selling has passed. This fully sustains the attorney gen eral's opinion. The auditor is now making out the pension warrants, 5,738 in number. Some of the iloors in the capitol are so -much decayed that steam cannot be turned on them, so offensive is the odor of the heated timbers. Bif-nhop Cheshire's address to the !North Carolina Methodist conference yesterday was extremely well received, lie says lie looks for unity of the JMethodists and Episcopalians. A republican state otlice-holder said today: "What fools our people have 1een before we have been in office a year, to raise all this row about passes. "VVe have ksilled the goose that laid the jrolden egg. Just at a time when passes could do us the most good we have cut them off." This week the penitentiary convicts, eventy-six in number, grading the ex tension of the Carthage railway, will ilnls'h it. It is not known what will then be done with them. A Mr. Wade a.t Hub, Columbus county, wants a numler of them. The postoffice-holding populists are trying to stem 'the current which is sweeping so many of their party back to the democrats. Judge Starbuck is making thing3 lively for delinquent tax payers in For syth county. He makes them all pay the tax and, in addition, the costs, never levs than $10. A republican says there -are now "six parties" in thrls state gold democrats, silver democrats, republicans, Russell republicans, Butler populists and Skin ner populists. It is said that the Lynch ites, or sanc tified band, have acquired a strange dominion over the people of Southport. A preacher, -When asked why the churches did not attack these people, said they would raise the cry of per secution. In one house in the village, of only two small rooms, seventeen persons live, sleeping together promis cuously, nine of them being children. It seems to be the duty of the churches to drive these people out of the state. The state authorities have been asked to do so, but have done nothing. There is not nearly so much enthu siasm here in the anti-saloon move ment or league as was at first shown, and its promoters are disappointed. Two of the numerous fakirs who at the various fairs In t'he state have so bodly swindled the people, are sent to the penitentiary from Forsyth. It is t'he remark of members of the democratic state committee that there la to be next year a clean, open dem ocratic fight from beginning to end, without compromise or fusion with any party. Weeks ago your correspondent pub lished the statement by a republican it hat it seemed to him that Senators Butler and Pritchard had agreed or about agreed to bury the hatchet. It was denied. Now the whole matter is up again. Some of the populists have for six mouths believed that Butler was trying to get in wifh the demo crats. Now they see that the demo crats will not touch him. Butler is jrreatly worried. The speech at Rocky Mount causes much of the worry. He Iras a four column editorial denial, rwitlh a score of affidavits. Mrs. Fanny Hayes, who has leen in charge of the old woman's home here, goes to Norfolk, and Mrs. Fletcher, of Wilmington, succeeds her. Engineer Thad Pleasants, of th Sea hoard Air Line, gets the $4,100 damages for injury Which the railway agreed to pay in compromise. Congressman Linney called on Gov ernor Russell yesterday. He is a crank on the anti-civil service question. Congressman Strowd declares that congress ought to take immediate teps to recognize Cuban Independence. Great progress is being made in "wfbeut erowing. The penitentiary not only has the Boylan farm near here, but also the Orimee farm. There are seven conferences of the Christian church in this state. .The laart oe is now 1n session. Mrs. Mary Bird, Harrisburg-, Pa., ways: "My child is worth millions to m; yet I would have lost her by croup ftad I not invested twenty-five cents fin a bottle of One Minute Cough Cure." It cures coughs, colds, and all throat tand lung troubles. R. R. Bellamy. .Kvangelistic Campaign In Onslow Connty (Correspondence of The Messenger.) Wards Mill, N. C, December 1. In less than three weeks there have leen three new Baptist churches organ ized with 127 members. The campaign has been led by the noted Evangelist 'Rev. J. T. Edmundson, of Littleton, N. C People rod? thirty miles last Sun day to hear this great man preach. There 'have been many professions dur ing the meeting and Rev. Blakely H. Mathews, the Baptist missionary of Onslow county, expects to baptize many more candidates. Mr. Edmund son and Mr. Mathews are now at Chris tian Hope church in the midst of a fine meeting. Many of the people of Wilmington re member with great pleasure that Mr. Edmundson held a meeting at South Side Baptist church in that city. To Send a 8mtll Cruiser to Ilaytl "Berlin, December 2. It is announced that only the small German cruiser Geier, wit!h a crew of 265 men, will be ordered to Port au Prince, Hayti, in order to support the demands of Ger many for an indemnity to Herr Emil Leuders for his alleged false impris onment by the Haytlan authorities. The Geier will only "demonstrate" If the pending negotiations with the JHaydan minister at Berlin sihou'Id fall. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Devoted Chiefly to Currency Question, and Foreign Affairs Annexation of Hawaii and Non-interference With Cuba Advo cated "Washington, December 2. The mes sage of President McKinley will be de voted practically to the subjects of foreign relations and the currency problem, 'it will be unique in one re spect in that it ignores the great bulk of matters usually constituting the de partmental portions of presidential an nual messages. There is scarcely a reference to the subject matter of the annual reports of the cabinet, the pres ident's purpose being to call attention only to the more important affairs of the government. For this reason the postal savings project of the postmaster general is not discussed in the message. While the detail of the currency plank are not definitely known, it can be au thoritively stated that it is in the main an incorporation of the views submitted by Secretary Gage, 'though as to details the president leaves him self freedom of action by not taking any position with reference to several features of the secretary's plan while endorsing its main object. A strong presentation of the Hawaii an question is made and congress is urged to tak immediate action by ratification of the treaty of annexation. This part of the message strongly de picts the necessity for making the is land part of the domains of the United States and reviews advantages chat would accrue to the country by its possession. As to Cuba the message calls atten tion to the recent trend of affairs on the island, refers to the scheme of au tonomy just offered by Spain and, af ter reciting other developments in the situation, reaches the virtual conclu sion that existing circumstances do not warrant interferences in the affairs of the .island. Considerable attention is paid to the subject of reciprocity negotiations with various countries in Europe. Special Commissioner Kasson has been work ing en this subject for some time and the message deals with some of the de velopments of negotiations already had and expresses the hope of the adminis tration to secure satisfactory results in the future. The policy of the adminis tration on this subject is outlined, and, citing French champagnes as an illus tration, the point is made that if special concessions are given any foreign pro duct the United States must be given equal treatment by reciprocal conces sions. The Alaskan problem is discussed at some length and a plan is made for congressional legislation, including the extension of the operation of the public land laws and the granting of rights of way for roads by which all parts of the country may be made more acces sible. Hart's Emulsion of Cod Liver Oil with Creasote and the Hypophoshites If faithfully used, is a specific in the treatment of weak lungs, Consumption Bronchitis, etc. Leading physicians re commend it.

Mias Muicer to he Married As Captain Munger formerly served on the United States revenue cutter Colfax in the port of Wilmington, the following from the Seattle Post-Inteli-gencer, November 21, will interest his and his daughter's friends here: Miss Henrico Munger, daughter of Captain 'and Mrs. F. M. Munger, and Mr. L. T. Jones, of the Grant, will be married December 8th. The wedding will be a quiet affair and none but the relatives and intimate friends of the contracting parties will witness the cer emony. The engagement was an nounced by Miss Munger at the recep tion given Wednesday afternoon on board the Grant. Mr. Jone3 is a south erner, his native home being Baltimore. He has been with the Grant for three years and is- considered one of the ablest young men in the service. Miss Munger is probably better known in this city than is Mr. Jones. Since Cap tain Munger has made Seattle his head quarters she has been here and has at tended many social functions. She i3 an accompished young woman and has accompanied her father on many of his trips to foreign ports and is as well informed about "service matters" as the average officer. Reports of the- Indian Schools Washington, December 2. The an nual reports of Indian schools show considerable progress at Carlisle, Pa., and Hampton, Va., the principal insti tutes. Superintendent Pratt, of Car lisle, reports an enrollment of 762 pupils at the beginning of this fiscal year and they include representatives of sixty eight different tribes. Captain Pratt presents a strong advocacy of the In dian outing system, which he says en forces economy and saving. By this means the boys and girls at Carlisle earned $20,448 during the year. The to tal enrollment at the Hampton insti tute is 138, embracing representatives of thirteen tribes. A Beet Nugwr Company Chartered Richmond, Va., December 2.

Brrce Appointed Register of the Treasury Washington. December 2. The pres ident today appointed B. K. Bruce, of 'Mississippi, to be register of the treas ury. Bruce represented Mississippi in the United States senate in reconstruc tion days and Is one of the best Jown negro republicans In the country. The position to which he is appointed is one he held some years ago. An English clergyman classes foot ball among the devices of the devil. It is certainly hot enough. Cincinnati Commercial Tribune.

PROPOSITIONS LAID BEFORE THE PRESIDENT BY THE CUBAN LEAGUE The Cause of Freedom Itetarded by Indirect Aid of Oar Government to !pain The Prupovitiou of Autonomy to Gala Time. The People Demand Kecogailion f, the Cubans ou Interference by Oar Gov ernment the tteult of Influence of the Money Power Washington, December 2. Mr. Berk ley Balch, secretary of the Cuban League, appeared before President Mc Kinley and presented the following ar gument in behalf of the Cuban insur gents: Mr. President: We appear before you in the name of those who have died for the cause of .freedom in, the island of Cuba, and for those who are still ready to give their lives today or to morrow for the cause; also represent ing as we claim, a majority of the peo ple of the United States, who lelieve in that cause, and demand that their wishes shall now be translated into efficient action by their chosen repre sentatives. Thanks to the power, honor and patriotism of the American press, the people today know the essential facts of the Cuba.n situation. We sub mit to you, therefore, these' ten propo sitions for your consideration: 1. The three wars in Cuba within this century are proof of a genuine movement for the extension of demo cratic principles and the attainment of liberty from a tyrannical, corrupt and alien government. 2. Without the indirect aid given by this government to Spain, the patriots would be further advanced in their struggle. 3. Spain has lost Cuba as far as the present population is concerned. If, however, she is permitted to continue the cruel work of exterminating non combatants, she may possibly recon quer and re-populate the island. 4. If with our passive aid, she un fortunately succeeds in doing this, when another generation comes, the revolution will surely begin again. The govering classes in Spain of all parties have regarded Cuba for 300 years as an orange to be squeezed. They are un able to consider it otherwise and no amount of diplomatic effort on our part is likely to change their point of view. The other classes are ignorant. Spain has held all her colonies with an iron hand until forced to let go. The war of liberation in Venezuela lasted fifteen years and during the last five years of the struggle no quarter was given by either side. 5. Autonomy is a foolish dream. It is evident that neither side understands it. wishes it, or can administer it. It is proposed to amuse this government and to gain time. 6. A majority of the people of this country desire to see a free and inde pendent Cuban republic. An opposing factor of great force is the money power. It is a fair conclusion to urge, that a majority of our people believe that the assistance of our government, till now, has been given to Spain and withheld from the republic, on account of the influence that eminates from great financial interests, usually afraid of patriotic aggressive movements. 7. Our people have hoped for favor able action for Cuba from the present administration and have patiently waited to give the administration time for consideration of the wise road to this end. That patience is now ex hausted. 8. Very few Cubans and still fewer people of this country desire immediate annexation; but independence is clear ly due to Cuban valor and sacrifices. 9. The friendship of the republic of Cuba is. worth vastly more to us than that of Spain, for reasons of business and defense. It is our duty and self interest to recognize the bellligerency, and, logically follow this, the indepen dence of the republic, and to conclude with a defensive and offensive alliance. If this is not compatible with a con tinued friendship with Spain, so much the worse for Spain. If Spain attacks us we can take care of our own. 10. Out of the experience of our work and from the study of over twenty years this league asserts that these ten propositions are true and that their right understanding leads to the only action which will solve the problem. And now, Mr. President, in behalf of those we represent, we thank you for this opportunity to present their views. We hope for such action on your part as will bring a correct solution. We desire to state that this league and our sympathizers have "enlisted for the war" or until such, times as the repub lic of Cuba shall become a fact in his tory. The president said he would give the argument careful consideration. Fraud Cases Dismissed Birmingham, Ala., December 2. In the federal court today nine cases against Major W. H. Hunter, three against Sandy White and six against C. C. Reed, charged with presenting false claims against the government were dismissed. Four years ago the federal grand jury here made sensational charges of wholesale frauds against the govern ment by federal officials in North Ala- bama alleging that the government had been defrauded out of about $100,000 by false claims by commissioners and deputy marshals. The treasury depart ment sent two examiners to investi gate. As a result two commissioners and eight deputy marshals were in dicted. Commissioner Robert Charl son, of Atlanta, whose stealing amount ed to $20,000 is now serving a term in the penitentiary. Other convictions oc curred but appeals were taken and cases dragged along until today when the last of them was finally dismissed. All parties are prominent. Hunter was formerly commander of the grand army of the republic dn Alabama. Sloan Not to Ride for the Prince ef Waes London, December 2. Gaines, the manager of Tod Sloane, the American jockey, says there is no truth in the statement made iby The St. James Ga zette yesterday afternoon that Sloane has contracted to ride for the prince of Wales and Mr. Pierre Lorillard. The manager said: "Sloane has not receiv-, ed an offer from the prince of Wales, nor !has he even met the prince. He highly appreciated the compliment the prince of Wales paid him in allowing htm to ride one of his horses, which was an unusual one considering that he was an unknown American when he came to England and without backing-."
