The animal was a monster specimen of his species, and the belief being ueiieral that it was a well developed case of hydrophobia, much alarm prevails in the neighborhood for fear that other dogs may be likewise affected, and fatal results follow f rom the biting of the girl.?

From "Washington. ? Members ot both political parties do not openly attach any great importance to the much-talked of coa lition for organizing the new Congress in March on the revenue reform basis. The Democrats who are reelected very generally declare that they will never vote for a lle publican tor speaker, even if he is an ('out and out " Free Trader. Western Repub licans state that if Congress meets in March they will be able to nominate in caucus and elect a Speaker who will substantially be a revenue reformer, without the aid of the Democratic, vote, and that there is no Re publican member who can be named now who will trust himself in l he hands of the proposed fusion. The members who have arrived do not think there will be much important legisla tion this session. The Ways and Means Committee arc goiiv: to work to reconcile the contradictions and inconsistencies of the internal revenue act pa-sed in July last. A j bill to raise the whiskey tax to >1 a gallon, I another t?? repeal the income tax alter '71, j and one to amend the national banking sys i tun, are already prepared. An entirely j new Southern Pacific railroad bill, asking lor the usual land grant, will be introduced the second day of the session.

[From the Miama (Mo.)

Jn strug I glitig to release herself from the grasp of I the demon, she was thrown violently to the i ground, and the heavy form of the negro i falling upon her, broke three of her litis j and otherwise injured her. AVc are in formed that as soon us he accomplished his j devilish designs lie attempted to shoot her, but, fortunately, the pistol would not fire, j The girl is au orphan, and but little hopes | of her recovery are entertained.

Orleans was evacuated on Saturday night, and the Army of the Loire retired to Bloi.s. There was much desultory fighting on Friday and Satur day along the whole line from Se veres to Arthenev, and the left wing of the Arrnv of the Loire was doubled up. The Prussians reached the railroad between Orleans and Tours at La Chapelle, near Orleaus, on Saturday afternoon, and li red upon the train upon which Gambetta was. The army of the Loire then concen trated in the line of the Orleans entrenched camp, ^00,000 strong, defended by 500 guns from the navy, determined to hold out to t lie last.

One hundred and seventy-three members of Congress an swered to roll-call. Duke, of Virginia, was seated after taking the old oath, as was Sy pher, of the First Louisiana District. The President, in his message, after con gratulating the country on its peaceful con dition and prosperity, regrets that the free exercise of the elective franchise has, by violence and intimidation, been denied to certain citizens in the several States in the several places lately in rebellion, and there by reversing the verdict of the people. "Referring to the European war, he speaks of the satisfactory manner in which the protection of the American Minister at Paris was extended to German subjects in Fraiice. Referring to the proclamation of the Republic he says that snould the pre sent struggle result in attaching the hearts of the French to the simpler forms ol a re publican government it will be the subject of still further satisfaction to the American people, who would not be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France. He says, that if the opportunity for interposing the good offices ot the United States in restoring peace shall present itself, the action will be promptly taken. As to Cuba, the President says the con dition of the insurrection has not materially changed. He renews his recommendation to annex San Domingo. He says as soon as it is known that the project is abandoned by the United States, negotiations will be opened for the possession by some of the .European Powers of the bay of Samana. He urges early action on Congress, and suggests that by a joint resolution of the two Houses the Executive shall be au thorized to appoint a commissioner to ne gotiate with the authorities of San Domingo for the acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made to defray the ex penses ot the commissioner. The qtiestion might then be determined either by the action of the Senate on the treaty or by the action of both Houses on a resolution of annexation, as in the case of Texas. With regard to the Alabama claims he recommends that Congress authorize the appointment of commissioners to take proof regarding them, and that authority i be given ft>r their settlement by the United States, so that the Government shall have possession and ownership of the private claims as well as of the responsible control of all the demands against Great Britain, t Regarding the fisheries and. the com plaints of the Canadian authorities, he says that they have uot been marked by a friend ly feeling, and that if Great Britain should attempt to force a certain act of the ''Do minion" Parliament it will be the Presi dent's duty to take such steps as may be necessary to protect the interests of the United States. He asks that power be conferred upon him to suspend the operation of the laws authorizing the transit of merchandise in bond through the United States to Canada, and also to suspend the operations of any law whereby vessels ot the "Dominion ' are permitted to enter the waters of the United States. He also complains of the pretensions of Canada to control the navi gation of the St. Lawrence river, and urges the importance and light of the United States to navigate that river without let or hindrance. With regard to the depressed condition of the foreign commerce of the United States, he recommends a liberal policy to wards the Pacific mail between California, China, and Japan ; and also that measures shall be taken to permit American mer chants to buy vessels built abroad, as well as encourage* American ship-building. With regard to the currency, the Presi dent says that the approach to the specie basis is very gratifying, but the instability of the currency is very prejudicial to the pros perity of the country. He thinks the time has arrived when, by wise and prudent legisla tion, Congress should look to a policy whieli would place the currency at par with gold at no "distant day. With regard to the revenue reform, he says that if it means to keep the reveuue down to what is necessary for the support of the Government, and what is necessary to pay the interest on the public debt, it has his hearty support ; but if it means a fail ure to provide the necessary means to de fray all the expenses of the Government, he "is opposed to it. The revenue reform has not been defined by its advocates, it seems, however, to be "accepted as some thing that was to supply every man's wants without cost or effort oh his part. [Laugh ter.] He recommends the abolition of the frank ing privilege and reform in the civil service, particularly as to the mode of appointing subordinate officials. After reading the message the Senate ad journed. Various routine business was transacted, including the introduction of bills to con stitute Sbreveport, La., and for the remo val of disabilities of all citizens of Louisi ana, and to abolish all income taxes. After the reading of the President's mes sage the House adjourned. The message is nine thousand and eighty five words, and wl& telegraphed thence "to New York in thirty-seven and three-quar ter minutes. Ten wires were used in its transmission. Washington News. Washington, Dec. 5.? Dixon, of North Carolina, has been seated, his disabilities having been removed. Piatt, of Virginia, moved that Colonel Duke's credentials be referred to the Com mittee on Elections. The motion was lost. A resolution that Duke should qualify was passed. Judge Hives gave notice that he will contest the election of Duke. The House then adjourned until 2 o'clock. The Senate opened with the usual for malities. The reading of the President's Message caused no sensation to-day in Congress; and was feebly applauded at the close. Themoney markets exhibit no material change. The Alabama LefflNlntnr<>. Montgomery, Ala., Dec. o.? Both Houses of the Legislature were at work to day. A message "from Gov. Lindsay was sent in, and 2,000 copies ordered to be printed. The election for United States Senators is exciting some attention. A ballot will be had to-ruorrow. There are no developments as to the Gubernatorial contest. ^ The Vote In "Vew York. Albany, Dec. 0.?
