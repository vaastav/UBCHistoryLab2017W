Explanations ol ■ causes of defeat were numerous, and in seme Cases decidedly amusing. At 12 o'clock, Speaker Elaine called the 1 louse to order. Prayer was offered by the Chaplain, the Lev. Dr. Sutler, the roll was then called and the following members did not respond, viz; Messrs, Horsey, of Maine; ■dmali,of New 1 Lm.pshire; Crocker, ol Massachusetts.; Pendleton, ol llhodo Island.

Title Ml.:-.'AUK Tv &:mUe mt./ a in -e e s 1 Since hlie convening of Congress, one year ago, the nation has under .jone a pros I rat ton in na.aae-'s and industri-s such m lias not been wit ■ ne.-sed with us for many years. Spe"- illation as to I lie cause for this pros tration might he in I a Iced in without prolit, heeause as many theories Would | tie advanced ;■*> there would be in dependent writers and those who | express-.! their Vea views without i borrowing upon th ■ sibject, witliout indulging in theori-s as to the cause of tins proslrali-m; tb-Tefore i will call your attention only to (lie fact and to some plain guestions as (~ which il would s-'cni there should he i no disagreement during this prostra tion. Two essential elements ol prosperity have boon most abundant. Labor and capital both have been largely unemployed. Where security has been undoubted capital lias been i attainable at Very moderate, tales, whore labor lias been wanted it has ; been found in abundance at cheap rates compared with what of nee rosaries and comforts of life could be i purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elements ul prosperity therefore, have not been denied us. I A third might be added, our sod and climate are une.pialed within the !limits of any contiguous territory under one nationality, for choice of products to feed and clothe a people, I ami in amount ot surplus lo spare to feed less favored people. Therefore, with these facts in view it scums to Imo wise .statesmanship at this session I if Cviigress would dictate legislation, i ignoring the past and direct.ng in proper channel these great elements j uf prosperity to .any people. Tho debt abroad is the only element that cun, with a sound currency, enter into our affairs, to cause any continued [depression. fa the industries and prosperity of our people, a great con ! llict for national existence made it necessary for temporary [imposes, the raising of large sums of money from whatever source attainable. —lt was made necessary in the wisdom ot Congress and 1 do not doubt their wisdom in tho vaemi-es regarding the necessity of the tunes to devise a system of national currency which it proved to bo impossible to keep on a par with tho organize.! currency of the civilized World. The President does not. believe lint -■) ie daymen'.': ho rescind hv MI)., DEC. 15, I7'S. January I, 1870. He strongly favors, a return to a gold currency, but | leaves to Congress the duty of fixing the time and manner of accomplishing I that result. He suggests, in this} connection, the rejieai ol the legal, tender clause in the currency act, to j take eli’ect as to contracts, after the day fixed hy law for its repeal; that: the Secretary of tho Treasury should | he given power to obtain gold Irom, and afier the date fixed by the act | providing for a return to specie pay-1 ments. This may be partially, if not wholly aecomplislied by bonds. Thej revenues of the country, he thinks, | should he in excess of the expenditures i to keep up this redemption, which] should be obtained by greater economy j in appropriations or by a reorganiza tion ol the tax law's. Flelative to 

THKK HANK IXO, tim President is ot the opinion tnat i whenever a return to spot ie payment.- 'is iicconiplisbed, hanking should not jhe limited. 1 1 should not he ma leu I monopulv bv limiting the amount, oi issue.

In short he will con tinue to maintain tho Kellogg govern ment to tho end of ill term unless ('ongress shall deem proper to take the question out of his hands. 

CIVIL SLUVICK. The President is ul the opinion that thoprinci) al of civil service has been adhered to as far as possible, in the face of the strenuous opposition it lias met with in variousqu irters, but that it is impossible to continue it without; ; tho cordial support of Congress and • ' the people, lit* thinks civil service, | so far as it has a (air trial, has proved ! of great benefit to tim Government ( 'service in all its branches.
