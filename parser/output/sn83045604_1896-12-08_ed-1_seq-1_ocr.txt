"Washington. i>*c. 7.-\vhiio the scenes attending the opening of the house today were both brilliant and interesting. :n uie cro» is that thAnged the galleries and the conspicuous p-rsonages present, the proceedings themselves were dull and spiritless, being distinctively routine. Tha house met. the chaplain Invoked the Di vine biasing on the work of the session, the roll was called and a committee, con sisting of Cannon of I.linois, Payne of New York and Turner of Georg.a, was ap pomted to **:t upon the president, and the latter'» annual communication was de livered. The reading consumed about two hours. It waa Mr. Cleveland's farewell message and there was much curiosity as to his Views, on Cuba especially. but there w as no demonstration. elthsr of approval or disapproval, throughout its reading. The holiday nature of the day was sad dened by the announcement of the death of ex-Speaker Crisp, which Turner, of Georgia, formally made to his associates. Th« opening words of the message can gntt ufeittag the country on the result of the election created a broad smile, the Democrats as well as the Republicans seemingly enjoying the political condition which allowed a Democratic president to felicitate himself upon a victory gained under the banner of the Republican party. The president's expressions on Cuba and Venezuela were 11.-rtened to attentively, but there were no demonstrations, even when be announced that the administration some months ago had suggested home rul» for Cuba to Spain, or when he an no mred the termination of the contro versy Great Britain and the T'nited State® over the Venezuelan bound ary line. There was not much Interest In the remainder of the mewfMge except those portion* relating<o tho tariff, the currency and trusts. The reading of the melange occupied one hour and forty minutes. At Its con ductor*. 0:1 motion of Dingley, Rep.. th% message and no-company ing documents wtrre referred to the committee of the whole on the Mate of the Union.

He fce.wt- to think it might be possible for a sa.tiKlon of affairs TO exis: In Cuba at some ttaie. no one knows when, that would Justify interference on higher grounds than those Involved In the ordi nary rights of nations. Tnft, Rep , Ohio, member of the com mittee on foreign affairs—The president's treatment of the Cuban question as a whole may be considered as notice to Spain that the present conditions cannot be prolonged Indefinitely. Indeed, it may s.-em a basis for intervention even before he g<s out of office, or tt gives him an opportunity to throw the question on to the shoulders of the succeeding adminis tration. Probably he will pursue the lat ter course. Dolllver, Rep.. lowa, member of the ways and means commit tee—The presi dent's treatment of the Cuban quej*tk>n is hardly satisfactory, e*rher to those who desire to see Cuban independence recog nized, or the class who d-'slre the United States to ke<«p clear of foreign disputes. Mediation by rhe United States would be in the dlrectton of a settlement honorable to both parties, but the president's hint of Wh.it is likely to happen in case media tion be refused is a little too mysterious for practical purposes. Dalzeil. Rep.. Pa., member of the ways and means committee —The m> ssage gives us no light on Cuba. The president as sume.s fro-m his information, which U no doubt reliable, that the Insurgents have no claim to pos-» ss a government or a capital. If this is true, they sre not en titled to recognition a- belligerents, and It follows that the> could not be recognized a- possessing independence. In his treat ment of the tariff the president is a lit tle unfair in Juggling with figures He un dertakes to compare the operations of the Wilson bill one y. ir with the same bill another year, instead of nith another bill, lie thinks the Wilson bill Is now of a higher character th in it was when he re vised to sign it.

Spain wilt pr"hafvv be influential!* supported if *he holds out. We hope she w:U not. prevail, because autonomy is bt-st u il* * n <i best for Spain." The Times says: "The tone and spirit of the mo*sa?e ts worthy of ad prn*f It 1s a pity the mod era it ,»n and balance of mind which Mr. Cleveland has just displayed no; mon» conspicuous last year, when he ftartle.l two continents by a menace of war.

Crt the adoption of a gen et ai arbitration treaty. It says: '"lt is clear that the deveitnd adminis tration means to <>onclude the great re form before resigning office." On the proposed Cuban settlement tha Chronicle says: "We believe the time has passed when the Cuban insurgents will accept any so lution plai ing Spanish officials over them, even nominally. There is no mistake, how ever, about the warning President Cleve land addresses to and Spanish statesmen should ivj aware that the n»mo critic government is far more pacific and conservative in its foreign policy than the incoming Republican government is likely to be Soain has to face a humiliating di lemma. hut she could not fight the United St a tea for twenty-four hours. Therefore, *he should sell Cuba quickly, hut he would be no friend of the I'nited States who would advise her to buy Cuba." The Standard (Conservative) says It thinks Spain had better accept Mr, Cleve land's friendly counsel, as Mr. M Kinlev is not likely to be les> exacting than Mr. Cleveland. The Standard says: "The Monroe doctrine is making great strides. It is a large. hold policy, but quite free from danger. Fortunately, ss far as England is concerned, the prospect of the arbitration treaty makes the r.sks of trou ble small. Altogether ii is a dignified and able message." THE 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. Fall Text of Mr. < levelsnd's I«a«t AddrrM to ('(iniirrH-Cahaii >ol to Be Recognised. WASHINGTON. Dec. 7. The full text of President Cleveland's message, today read in both houses of congress, is as fol lows: To the Congress of the I'nited States: As representatives of the people in tho legislative branch of their government, you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free instl tv lions »rv 4 tfc* tw»e"»-»'-lyrp» rw enjoy popular rule hare been afcaln made manifest. A political contest Involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating ag gressiveness so Intense as to approach bit terness and pas.'don has been waged throughout our land, and determined by the decr»x» of free and Independent suf frage without disturbance of our tranquil ity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. When we consider these Incidents, and contemplate the peaceful obedience and submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions, we discover an evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will, and to be controlled at all tirms by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to demand of th>se undert.iklntr to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be promoted by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites.

This report was laid before congress toda> .«s an appendix ;o the president's message. It treats of many details of our relations during thv past year with foreign governments not tou. 1- ed upon at all in the message, or rnoru briefly treated. S. .retary Olney acts out in detail t!u* story of the growth of the Cuban rebel lion. the present evil state of iff.tlra on the island and the further facta upon which the president bas<■•< his statemnu and concluaicn.-. The secretary's csti ntata of the present situation Is disclosed in <he foiiowing paragraph made after a piellminary statement of the destruction of the Industrial resources of Cuba: "From whatever point of view we re gard the muter it !« impossible r;«>t ?>> de cern thai a state of thlng> exists At our doors alike dangerous to good relations destruitl\e to comnwrcf, fatal to the external resources of Cuba and moot vexatious urd trying becaiss en tailing on this government excessive btrdetts In lis domestic administration an<! in its outward r iations. This situa tion cannot indefinitely continue »iifu>ilt growing woise, and the- time may no; be far distant #ht n the I'nited States must seriously consider whether It s right* and interests ,is well as its international du ties, in view of Its peculiar relations to the i*i*.nd, <lo not call tor some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued." Ttie secretary makes it plain that the present Insurrection is far more formida ble than the famous •ten years' insurrec tion," which began at Vara in IW. Ho stays that. starting in the same portion of the Island, it very early rook proportions beyond its predecessor and assumed the aggressive ptuiM-. Passing the defensive lines of the trocha traversing the island from north to south, formidable bodies of the revolutionary forces early in th>- year established themselves in the rich sugar plantations of Clara and deirfme* go*. made hostile forays almost in flight of Havana itself, and advarx -ig forward effected a lodgment in the fertih tobacco fields of Plnar de! Rio. where they have frustrated all efforts of the Spanish army to overcome them. The secretary aay» that white as yet no prominent ports have been attacked by the Insurgents, a large portion of the *,so® tnlks of coast Is prae- tga»i>: in Mwlr hands, asd it >t» it* ruseM arid wild hmncier 1< peculiarly fitted for gi.ei rfllrt warfare and affords easy menus of landing clandestine supplies of men and arms. Tho secretary adds; "While th<>-< In fact eontrolling the large part of the Island of •' HM from Cape Fan Antonio to Cape V.ild and enjoying practically an unlimited n*o of an equal ly large part of the coast, the revolution ary for re" are scattered. being never united for a length of time to form ;»n armv •-a pa Me of attack and siege and tit to tak * 'he defensive in a pitehed buttle. Assembling suddenly « given j«otnt, often in H single night, they make unex pected sallies and carry destruction to the tobacco and » cie

As bearing upon the que a ion of recog nftlon of the Insurgents, w hich is to come In some Shape before congress, the fol lowing statement from Secretary <Mney is de> lining recognition: "So far a* our Information shows. there Is not only no effective local government by rhe Insurgents in the territory they overrun, but therr 1* not evt-n a tangible pretense to «»smbllsh nti Hdmlnliflrntton anywhere.

The secretary ax- presses regret that the British govern ment has refused Its concurrence in a pro posed International commission to devise means to protect the seal herds; recites the Adding* of the exports in effect show ing that .no herd Is threatened with total destruction unless changes are mads speedily In the award regulations, and hopes that the experts" report will induce the British government to ogroe upon these changes.

Other Foreign Coaatries. Under the head of Germany, the report treats brefly of tha ccrohtsMn from that country of American moat products. TT\s situation apparantly remains unchanged, as there has been no anieliorattaft of th« stringont moasures adopted by Ckrmany. "on assumed grounds of publio health." against our cattle. "On the contrary." says the secretary, "the disposition of <J<n-many visible for a number of years past, to stll further im pede and virtually Inhibit this legitimate traffic, is evidenced by fresh restrictive measures. Tho unjust inability and the er roneousness of the premises o« which fhey rest have been again pointed out and th« h i)t ifn!n« -* "f our exports supported by conclusive proof." The secretary says there ere fslr pros pects of the ultimate removal of the in terdiction upon American life insurance com pin a s seeking to do business In Ger many. The subject of the reimposltion of ton nage dues on German vessels is discussed compactly, to show that the law was man datory upon the president to Issue his proclamation, as won as the facts were established. Hawaii comes In for a single short par agraph In the report, stating that no ques tions of importance have ar sen. that a few claims for Indemnity have been died in behalf of T'nlted Htsrtes citisens arrest ed during the last rebellion, and that the tinal chapter In the history of that at tempted revolt was reacheu In tfts pardon of the ex-queen. Same** is also briefly treated, the altu ation being unchanged and the United States necessarily continuing to exercise ail stipulate rights snd duties under the tripartite general act of Berlin during the continuance of the compact, however irk eome end unnatursl these rights snd du ties may prove to be. It 1s Indicated that the t,Tnlte<S State* will appoint a successor to Chief Jutt :ce Ide. who resigned. An explanation of the difficultly that arse in <onne<'tk>n with the effort t« pro tect I'nittvi tftateg naturalised cltSiefis. usually Jew® who return to Russia, Is af for«led by the following paragraph: 'Holdin* to th« old doctrine of perpet ual allegiance, refuting to lewn lis au thority t.y concluding any treaty recog nising tho naturalisation of a Russian subject without prior Imported consent; asserting th« extreme rignl to pimlsh a naturalised Itusstnn oa return to his rwi tive jurisdiction. not merely for unau rhorisod emigration, but al«o for rhe unpermitted acquisition of a for* ••tgn «'i! *.-t, »up: .H.d »e»inU>!.<ty »>t".>'y"xc. at iKime and through the eWoBi *c*s of Ms agerrt s ahrosid, to all j«*r*o«» of tho Jewish befi-r ihe stern rwtrtotlons en joined by Rumdao law. the govern m-nt of ltus«la takes a ground not admitting of »(fiul«rfnw by tie I'nltad be rauw »t variance with the (Character at our Institution*. the sernHnent* of r*ir paople. tflie provisions of our •sttftaa and the tendencies of modsra international comity." .. ...
