THE NEWS, The most cheering tokens come hack to us from the expedition to Texas. Our suc cesses continue, and important advantages recently gained arc noted in our New Or leans dispatches c ia Cairo. And respon sive to this progress of ouranns,the Union •incn of Texas arc taking measuies that will clinch the nails Gen. Banks Is driving. Texas is hopdessly lost to the Confederacy, and their last semblance of power there •will shortly die out. Our news from Arkansas is confirmatory of previous reports relative to the growing sentiment of the people of that State when once the rebel power and terrorism is broken. Fromprescnt appearances, Texas will be the first of the rebellious States to rqjoin the Union, and eat “clothed in her right mind" among her recovered sisters. From Cairo we have particulars of the recent guerilla firing on the steamer Von Phul, in which she narrowly escaped de struction. As it was, the attack gives a painful list of casualties In killed and wounded; among the former, the Captain of the steamer. In the Semite yesterday, Davis, of Ken tucky, set about his old game of abusing loyal men, and heaping ignominious re proaches upon them. He woke up Hide, of Hew Hampshire, who fell at work upon the Kentuckian in sledgehammer style, driving him from point to point, and final ly forcing him to beat a retreat and retract or modify his libels. Th- day of unre buked rebel rant in the* Federal Congress is over. On the inside, this morning, we give a revised publication of the closing part 01' President Lincoln’s recent Message and the entire Proclamation, happily fivt over against the lugubrious production of Jeff Davis, -which reads like the trail of a dying buccaneer. There is no sound in it but the death rattle, and no promise but of speedy dissolution without resurrection. Bayard, of Delaware, is evidently in quest of cheap martyrdom, by refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the United Slates as prescribed for all Senators. Ho threatens to resign if he is forced to do so. The temper of that body will find another : name for it if Ins resolution docs not waver. Resignation indeed—did Bright resign? The contumacious rebel from Delaware cannot too soon givc*placc to a better man. The Aimy of the Potomac has finally gone into winter quarters, and under a general order furloughs will from this time forth be granted to officers and men who, by their good conduct, have deserved them. In all the reverses and failures that incompetent leaders and blind comming ling of counsels have visited upon this noble army, its soldiers have won deathless re nown for their courage, and have deserved what has eluded them—complete success. Gen. Meade is to retain command, as ca pable for each charge in bivouac and camp, though* among its first outfits for active service will probably be a new com mander. . A rumor comes from Nashville of tf re pulse sustained by Gen. Sheridan’s ad vance in pursuit of Longstrect, but it will be safer to discredit it, as warned in the •dispatch itself, since oar special dispatch from Chattanooga makes no mention of it Other than this point in doubt, all is quiet both at Chattanooga and Knoxville, and the war in Tennessee presents only the new feature of a rapidly growing dis position among Its people to relieve them selves from rebel rule, and purge them selves from the rebellion by the provirions in the President’s recent Proclamation.. Already multitudes arc pressing forward to take the oath. There is still & doubt whether the rebels have shut off the* supplies of necessaries from reaching onr soldiers, prisoners at Richmond. The 'question of fact should he settled as carly.as possible, to the relief of the thousands of friends of the prison ers at the North, whose good offices should not be called forth only to he made futile, and yet who will unwillingly cease from sending forward supplies if they can reach their destination. The measure Introduced in the Senate by Mr. Lane, of Kansas, whatever be its fate in either body of Congress, will be of about as mncli practical effect as an act to regu late snow-falls in Kennebec. It is out of the reach of legislation, and any statute sought to cover the subject would fall dead und inoperative from the start* This opin ion we .venture more in consideration with the facts than from any sympa tbj’ with the interest sought to be abolish ed. Dealing in foreign exchange, and all the modes, tricks and practices of the Wall street fraternities will still be in vogue when the child of to-day is a very old wan, and can only feebly remember the great rebellion. * Gen. Schofield goes to Washington to give place to a better man in Missouri, The Conservatives of that Slate are in a bad way, rejected, as they are, both by people and President, and now deprived of their military champion. Gold in New Turk was a shade easier yesterday, closing at 473-8, a falling off of one cent from morning quotations. The disappointment of the rebels over Longstrect is beyond concealment One of their newspapers bitterly says, “ the result of Longstrect’s campaign may be summed up In & ffinglc word—nothing.” The possession of tins region is absolutely indispensable to the traitors, and so con fessed by them. * A brigade of colored troops in General Butler’s department have accomplished a noteworthy exploit They marched from Portsmouth, Va., to Elizabeth City, K. C., taking possession of that place. . A gallant Illinois officer, Col Chetlain, of Galena, commanding the 13th Illinois volunteers, has been made Brigadier Gen eral of colored troops. A good selec tion, and a splendid copy of a man to set before the imitative and courageous black soldiers. _• Characteristic. —The scceeh organ, of yesterday, makes a great splutter over pub lishing the Message of Jeff. Davis, Of course the organ of treason would exert itself to get ont the treasonable uttcrings of Us rebel master. Nothing more natural than it should have received an advance copy from the veritable Jeff himself, We publish all the extracts this morning necessary to let onr readers understand the drift which the plans and prospects of the rebel leaders ore taking, and that is dll, we presume, they will care to know. Tbc blow the organ makes to cover up its relish for treason Is too absurd for notice. 

ATROCIOUS MURDER AND ROB BERY AT SHARON, WIS. night and Capture of the Murderer. [Special Correspondence of the Chicago Tribune.] Woodstock, McHsnrr Co„ HI., I Dee. J4,1663. f A most atrocious and unprovoked murder was committed, on Wednesday night last, at Sboron, Walworth county, Wisconsin A fellow, whose name was subsequently ascer tained to be Kauffman, called about nightfall at the residence of a well-to-do cltircn named Stephen Crook, and sat there talking till late at night. He then asked if he conld stay all night; and being answered In the negative, went ont* Mrs. Crook told her husband that she feared from the sinister looks of their late guest thathe would steal theborees. Crookllt the lamp and went ont to the bun, In a few seconds the wife was startled by hearing ' p|f VOLUME xvn. a pistol shot, and running oat saw hus band lying on the gronnd dead, with a ballet Uirougb his breast; his pockets had been ri fled of about $lO, and tbc villain was gone. The neighbors ran’ out too, to see what was the matter, and commenced to search for the murderer, bot the darkness favored hlm’aud he escaped. He was caught .the next day at Poplar Grove, a small station on the line of railway between Rockford and Kenosha. He was brought to this place where he is now in jaiL The deceased, I learn, was highly esteemed in the neighborhood. When caught the murderer had upon his person two load ed revolvers, a bowicknife and the money of his victim. Csf“ The Muscatine Journal is entirely in error in stating that the Chicago is indebted to it for that' portion of the Mes sage which was re-telegraphed. Oh Inquir ing at the telegraph office here, we learn that a few sentences were received from the ope rator at Muscatine, but It was not used, and not a line of It came into oar hands. As be fore staled, the missing part of the Message was telegraphed from Springfield, Illinois. LOSS OF THE WEEHAW KEN. Loss of Fonr Officers and Twenty- 'six of Her Crew. HO DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY THE BEST OF TEE FLEET. It seems reduced to almost a certainty that the painful disaster to the Wechawkcn was due to the carelessness on the port of those in charge of her, the accounts of the casualty in no essential particular varying from that we present below. Aznongthepcrsossknown* to be on board was Ensign J. H. Reed, sec ond eon of John L. Reed, Esq., an old and prominent resident of this city. Great anx iety was entertained by his friends, happily set at rest by the following letter received yesterday from the young officer Chaslestok Hanson, I Flag Smp Philadelphia, Dec. 6,1893. f I suppose you have beard, before this readies you, of Ihe sinking of. ihc Wccbawkea. 1 was on board, but was saved. relayed by the sbip until tho ordsr was given, “All hands rate yourselves," then jumped over board, and by swimming and bolding on to aboard kept above water tni picked up. Do not know yet bow many were lost, but thtntr about twenty-five. Your affectionate sou. Ensign Reed is a graduate of the Naval Academy at Newport, and was with Parra gut on the Hartford, participating In all the stirring scenes in the Western ending with the surrender of New Orleans, at which he was present. His many friends will re joice at his happy escape from the disaster of which-the details we copy as follows: [From the New York Herald, Dee. li] At two o’clock on Sunday afternoon, while d furious wind prevailed from the North west, the iron-dad Weehawken, lying at the entrance of Charleston harbor, went down. a l , her anchorage—went suddenly, swiftly and unaccountably to the bottom—and carried with her, to a horrible death beneath the waves, four of her engineers and twenty-sir ofhcricrcw. Saturday had been a bright and beau‘iful day, with scarcely a breath of air astir, and with a unruffled sea. Daring the night a freeze sprang up, and the wind, blowing freshly at daylight on Sunday, increased by noon to a violent storm. The iron-clad fleet was lying meantime at its usual anchorage. The frigate New Iron sides was stationed off* Moms Island, at a distance of about one mile due east from Fort Wagner—or, as it is now called, Fort Strong. North of the Ironsides lay the flag ship Philadelphia, distant about four hundred yards. The weehawken was next in line, anchored two?or three hundred yards to the northward of the flagship. The Montauk was on picket duty, between Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie. * Astern of the Ironsides laytheNahant and Passaic—the latter far thest away from the flagship, and nearer than any other vessel to the adonis Island Shore.. The South Carolina and the Homo were rock ing on the restless tide some five or six hun dred yards astern of the iron-dads. # Tbe above was the position of the fleet when the first signal of distress was made from the Weehawken, at a few minutes be fore two o'clock. The signal was seen and answered at once by the flagship, from which four boats were dispatched to her assistance, and by the South Carolina, which sent two of her boats to -the Weehawken’s aid. The ’ tugs Dandelion and Iris were also at once called up, and with them Commander Dan can, of the Weehawken, who chanced to be on the fhgehip, and in conversation with the Admiral, when the signal was made, pro <xcdcd immediately, with the hope of ran uing his vessel on the beach. He had scarce ly left the Admiral when the officer of tbc deck made out from the Weehawken a new signal, and immediately reported her to be sinking. A moment after she settled swiftly down by* tbc head, careened slightly over to star board,’ and disappeared beneath tbc waves. It is impossible to convey any idea of the appalling nature of this disaster. It came with the suddenness of a thunderbolt. When the first signal of distress was made no one divined how serious was tbc danger, and when, at length, the vessel went down, it was difficult for those who saw her disappear to credit even their own senses. The confu sion on the flagship, arising mainly from the difficulty of launching her ooats, and the de sire of both officers and men to bo first In them, was most intense and painful The wind was now’ blowing with great fury, and the boats which hastened from all sides to the scene encountered great peril In picking up from the water the fcn’whohadsncccedcu in getting away from the Weehawken before site sank. Almost at the moment she went down some twenty or more sprang to the boats. and succeeded- In getting away. As many others were rcscuea from the surging waves by tbc launches of the flagship, the South Carolina and the tug boats Dandelion and Iris. Thirty perished. AH day the Weehawken had labored heavi ly In the sea, whichjtcpt her decks constant ly submerged, and which frequently swept In huge volumes into her forward hatch. To wards noon the crew.commenced paying out jfltatTi, to case hen but, accustomed as they were, in every gale, to the shipping of such seas, it is believed that they had grown con fident and careless of danger, and paid no heed to the encroaching waters until it was too late to resist them. They dreamed of no peril till the waves had fairly yawned to swallow them. Then, when it was known for a cer tainty that the vessel was to be lost, f panic of fright and fear benumbed them,- fid the terror-stricken crew below had littlepowcrto help themselves. There were men In irons be tween decks, and the sergeant-at-arms rush ed frantically away to mease them. Poor fellows, they all went down. There were in valids in the sick bay, and to their relief the surgeon sent his steward, who never return ed. There were firemen at the furnaces, to whom vain shrieks for a helping hand at the pumps were made. A v fcw of the confident were rushing to their quarters to save their effects, jostling the timid on their way to the deck to save themselves. It was in the midst of scenes like these thatthe Weehawken went down. I believe that none of the officers perished save the four assistant engineers, who. were overtaken by the flood before they could make any effort to escape. Commander-Duncan had only taken command of the Weehawken . on Saturday, having been detached from the Paul Jones to relieve Commander Calhoun. Tha officers’ clothing, the paymaster’s fonds and the papers of the ship sank with her. The yeoman wasbrongul alive on board the flagship, but died in spasms a few moments afterward. Various parties were picked up* and taken to the nearest vessels, where every provision was made for their comfort and restoration. Those of the crew who were saved arc now scattered in small squads throughout the fleet. It is impossible to pro cure at present the names of those who were lost. The Weehawken is laying in five fathoms of water, and will soon be raised. - Until sbe is brought up, no one can tell with certainty why she sunk. It was through no fault of her‘‘overhang;” for she apparently took in no water at her forward hatch and hawse hole. It was, to the best of my knowledge, through ‘ the inattention, neglect and bad management of those on board that the ves sel has been lost. Had the pumps been set at work when the waves first dashed in, it is probable that the Weehawken would at this' moment have been afloat. Had the „bars with which her compartments were made water-tight been in their proper t places, It is quite Jikcly that the dire calamity would never have occurred. Mr. Falcon, a practical -diver, left Hilton Bead this morning for the scene of tbc disas ter. He had engaged a passage to New York by the Fulton, but left the elnp immediately on learning the startling intelligence that an iron-clad had sunk.' THE

By steamer City of Alton, from New Or leans the sth Inst, I have the extra New Or leats Time* of Saturday, Dec. 5, bringing Im portant news as follows: Another victoiy has been gained by soldiers of the Depart ment of the Gnlf over the rebels in Texas, and is thought to be Important. Official in formation has been received at the Depart ment Headquarters that all the rebel force at Port Covallo, were captured by our forces.* Not a man was lost on onr side. Maj. Gen. C. C. Washburn, Comd’g the Union Troops. All the garrison guns fell into onr hands. It is not known what number of the enemy has been taken, but at last accounts from there, previous to the capture, .the rebel gar rison consisted of a thousand men under the command of Col. Brad Cite. A Texas refugee informs ns, tb&t about two months ago, there were seven heavy guns and five field pieces in Port Covallo. A glance at the map will show the import ance of this victoiy. Port Covallo and the captured works ore located on the point of tbc Peninsula which separates Matagorda Bay from the Gnlf. The possession of this point clears the entrance to the Bay, and' gives the Union army command of- several important places—Salucria, Port Lavaca and Matagorda., . A short distance back from the Bay is Vic toria and several other towns, all of which arc open to the occupation of onr troops. A large quantity of cotton bad accumulated at Victoria at the time of the capture of Brownsville, and as there was no chance of the owners getting it ont of the country, and no means of entering it except by slow pro cess of ox teams, it will probably soon be come the property of the United States. Boston, Dee. New Orleans corres pondent of the Boston Traveller writes that the' expedition of Gen. Banks to Texas is a glorious success. The Union men arc rallying under the standard of Gen. Banks ia large numbers. All the Texans required was a force to back them up, and. they repeatedly said that If a sufficient army was sent to assist them, they would soon have Texas all right again. . They have already proved the truth of their statements, for Gen. Banks has recruited two regiments since he landed in that State, and the work is still going on.. FROM SPRiaaFiELD. [Special Dispatch to tbc Chicago Tribune.] SpniNonELD, HL, Doc. 15, 1863. An order bos just been issued that volun teers now in the service re-enllstlng as vet eran volunteers shall have a furlough of at least thirty days previous to, the expiration of their original enlistment. This privilege will be secured to the volunteers either by ordering all so re-enlisting to report through the Governor to the Superintendent of the Recruiting Service for furlough, or by grant ing fnrlouglis to the men immediately. The Provost Marshal of the Seventh Dis trict has forwarded ICO recruits and 33 desert ers during this month. I learn that a man by the name of C. Col lins is traveling over -the State collecting money and representing that he is employed as State Sanitaiy Agent. Tbc authorities arc making sn effort to secure-his arrest. The Ladies’ Loyal League of • Jerseyvillc sent $73 to the State Sanitary Commission. Adjutant General Fuller is preparing a fall report of all receipts, which will be published in a few days. The Kendalls, who were arrested near Springfield for resisting the attempt of Depu ty Marshal Morgan to arrest the deserter Allen, have been held in $1,500 bail each for trial. Major W. W. Wilshirc, p of the 136 th Illinois volunteers, has been dismissed, with the loss of all pay and allowances,'for presenting and certifying to false and fraudulent accounts against the Government. •Colonel D. Wickeraham, of the 10th Illinois Cavalry, Is in the city, and will shortly open a recruiting office for the 10th and ',lßth Illi nois Cavaliy. The First National Bank organized in this city on Saturday last The following named gentlemen were chosen officers of the insti tution: John Williams, President; George N.

Captain David Black, of the Sd Illinois Cav alry, and Lieutenant Isaac Brown, of the 108 th Illinois volunteers, liavc bccq honor ably dismissed from the service on account of disability. 

FROM ST. LOUIS. * [Spcdnl Dispatch to tbc Chicago Tribune.] St. Louis, Doe. 15, 1883. The question of the removal of Gen. Scho field is warmly discussed here in military and civil circles. Gen. Schofield received a dispatch Satur day afternoon from Secretary Stanton, re questing his presence In Washington. It is reported here that he takes command of a corps in the Army of the Potomac. The Radicals in the Missouri delegation went to Washington well stocked with docu ments adverse to Schofield; and the recent State election going against the Conserva tives, Mr. Lincoln has doubtless had a now revelation. The first lowa colored volunteers, under Col. Hudson, has marching orders for the South. FEOK CAIRO AfJD BELOW. [Special Dispatch to the Chlcajo Trihnnc.l Caibo, Dec. 10,1883. On the Ist inst Natchez was threatened by the rebel General Adams, with two thousand men and ten pieces of artillery. CoL John son, in command, was reinforced hy General Graham, from Vicksburg, who went in pur suit of Adams. He captured a few prisoners, but could not bring on n general engagement. This is the end of an affair which seemed at one time to he quite serious.' The Memphis Bulletin of the 11th has the following further particulars of the late fight at Wolf River Bridge: • On Thursday, the 8d inst., the rebels made an attempt on Collierville, the troops there being commanded by Colonel Frank A. Ken drick, 2d West Tennessee regiment, the ob ject being, to destroy the railroad bridge across Wolf River. The object of the rebels being made known, the planks and bridge were taken up on the main Collierville road, In the afternoon, 'and a small cavalry force made a demonstration on the brldgcand withdrew. The Union force In .this .engagement lost two guns and one mftn wounded. Early on the morning of the 4th it was dis-' covered that Lafayette had been burned. VThe 6th Illinois cavalry arrived and joined CoL Kendrick, ahead of Colonel Hatch's cavalry brigade. Tho Cth and a portion of another regiment Lad crossed tho bridge and got into ambascade. The bridge was soon obstructed with caissons. The enemy made a desperate attempt upon the bridge, but the place was steadily defended. This had gone on half an hour, when Colonel Hatch's force arrived. Colonel Hatch had Jiardly joined in the ac tion when he fell, severely wounded. Tht command then devolved upon Colonel Ken drick, who placed a portlon.oi. ‘be ±owa. cavalry with revolving rifles a. the bridge. CoL Foley’s command was now. attacked by superior numbers, but held their' own, and the rebels were beaten .off. In the mcantlmfc the artillery at the fort was attacked by keep ing up a fire under order of LicaL Fuller. At ten minutes past four p. m., finding their ef forts all in vain, they retreated precipitately, with a heavy loss, leaving twenty-two dead end four wounded on the field, and carrying off sir wagon loads of others wounded, as previously reported. The Union forces took eight prisoners in all, five of whom were wounded. I am indebted to Messrs. R. T. Colburn, of tbc New York ITor.V, Thonfts W. Knox, o» the New York Herald, and other gentlemen who were passengers on the steamer Von Flml, for the following account of the disaa cr occurring to said et earner: On Tuesday, tbc Bth Instant, at about 2 P. SI., as the Henry Voa Phul was entering the foot of Morgonsca Bend, above Bayou Sara, a battery of six guns, located on the shore, opened upon her. The first missile—a twen ty pound shell—entered the pilot house, , oc cupied at the time by the captain, pilot and barkeeper, almost instantly killing Captain Gorman, the shell tearing away his abdomen and upper viscera. Then followed a second shell, which did no particular damage. The third shot again en tered the pilot house, killing the barkeeper, named Murray. He was struck in the groin,, and died in a few moments. After this some ten or. fifteen shot and shell followed In quick succession, crushing through the texas and cabin, one narrowly missing the supply pipe- The pilot, James Allen, stuck faithfully to his post—the engines yet being intact—and soon passed out of range. - T Six miles above the scene of firing lay tl[e gunboat Neosba at anchor. On the arrival of the Von Phul the gunboat took her in con voy to the Red River. At the head of the bend, the some battery opened again, firing about forty shot, thirty, of which struck the boat One shell pierced tiic side and striking the boiler, partially dis abled her, but did not explode it. Her en gines were able to convoy the Vol Phul out of range. Neosba immediately replied to the battery with her guns, bat the rebels paid no heed to them, continuing to concentrate their fire upon tha- unprotected and unarmed steamer. They kept up the conflict untlhdnsk. The steamer Atlanta hove in sight shortly after the occurrence, on her way from Red river. On learning the situation of affairs, Capt. 31cDoagal kindly offered to tow the Von Phul to the Red River and remain by he' till morning. All the passengers behaved with becoming coolness during the* whole affair. There were many narrow escapes, among which should bo mentioned that of Mr. Douglas, Clerk of the Won Phul. A shell crossed close to his head while he was en gaged in attending ladies on board to d place of safety. • * The Government agent, Mr. Mck>, was con spicuous In his attentions to the wounded during the firing and for watchfulness lest the boat should take fire. The casualties on the Voc-Phul were as follows: . LIST or CASUALTIES. Capt. P. fireman, killed: Hugh 31array, barkccp-, cr, killed; John Martin, deckhand, killed; James Joice. deckhand, killed: D. Hamlin, of St. Lonls, seriously hurt: J. J. Edwards, slightly: 6. C. Dccscar, slightly; D. McLeod, barber, slightly; Sami. Bsmlm, slightly. Mr. Hamlin is a cousin of Vice President Hamlin, and has a family in-St. Louis. He was on a return trip from below. wounds are not considered dangerous; and Mr. Thomas W. Knox, of the New York Herald, was slightly Injured by an unezplodcd shell. Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon Mr. Allen, the pilot ol the Von Phul, who first saw the captain flill dead at his feet,, the barkeeper—the clothes of the latter al most touched his own when he was hit—yet amid this accumulation of horrors, knowing thcfite of all on board depended on him, he stood firm at his post, not knowing how soon a shot might reach him, and by doing so he saved hundreds from death or captivity. Not until afterthe second firing were the ladies taken on board the Neosho. It was feared tbc rebels' might opan fire again near Red River, but they did not see fit to do so. This is the first time the Von Phnl bos oxer been under fire, and her officers wore congratulating themselves on their good for tune but a few moments before the attack took place. At Little Pock 7,000 men had come in since the occupation, 5,000 of whom are now in the Federal army. The people arc satisfied that slavery must go by the board, and ore .favorable to any instrumentality capable of bringing them under the protection of the Union government. *ln less than twelve months Arkansas, with a new constitution, will be in that honorable position—Confed erate sway broken effectually, never to be re stored. It is stated that the 58th Illinois regiment, CoL Lynch, is to be famished with Spring field muskets. Twenty-nine new recruits reported to U. 8. Pro Tost Marshal Phillips to-day and were as signed to commands. A good proportion go to strengthen the 6th Illinois cavalry. Forty deserters were brought in, cn route for their regiments, from the North. New Orleans papers of the 7th Inst, are received. They contain no news of im portance. ■ The Yon Phul arrived here last night. She Is not badly injured, though pierced by shot and shell in many places, and will soon be on the waters again under a new commander. The loss of her noble Captain will be severe ly felt in commercial circles. I had the pleas morning of meeting Q. K. Underwood, late of the Helena (Ark.) Shidd, now tu route for Washington. I have before stated that Mr. Underwood was a* -prominent candidate for the Military Govern orship of Arkansas. If worth and recom mendations as the best of Union men in the State stand for anything at Washington, he will receive the appointment. Mr. Underwood is a Tennesseean by birth, and a Memphian by raising and education. He removed to Helena in 1833, where he has since resided, exercising a wide-spread and Important influence upon the general inter ests of the State, as editor of the -Helena SKigd, a newspaper which, for nearly a quar ter of a century; has taken an active part in national and State politics.

A. Chctlain, of the 12th Illinois volunteers, has been appointed- Brigadier General, to command colored troops. Washington, Dee. 15.—The Inundation of the army with political Brigadier-Generals has received snch an earnest protest from Grant and Hooker, that It is not only very certain that the flood will bo-stayed‘in the future, but IbatCongrcss win correct many of Use errors of tho post in this regard. A r-pedal joint committee will probably b<r appointed to consider what legislation Is necessary to enable loyal people at the South to restore their States to the Union, on the basis of the President's Message and Procla t mixtion. To this committee will probably ’be referred the bills now before Congress on the subject.of siaven*, and such .other bills as may be Introduced; which hear upo"h tho general topic.” New York, Dec. 15, IB6o—The New York TWtuue'xspecial says; “ There are additional reasons for believing that General Schofield will soon be removed,* and a man whose heart is with what arc call ed radicals will be put in his place. As to any change in the Cabinet, nothing is posh lively known. • • Scnator.Bayard, of Delaware, never having taken the anti-rebellion oatli required by the act of last session, was informally reminded of the fact by the Vice President ’to-day, and requested to'say whether he was prepared to take it, and he replied in the negative, add ing that if the Senate,-by formal vote, .requir ed him to take it, ho should resign. The question will probably be brought up to-mor row, and there Is np doubt that if lie keeps his promise, Delaware will have a mqre fitting representative. The most irpport int concessions have been made to volunteer officers in the navy by the Government. Their names will be Inserted, 1 understand in the Bcgister v in exactly the same manner as the regular'naval officers. Washington, Dee. K.—The bill of Senator Lane, of Indiana, relative to the law of July, 1803, to define and punish treason, and the 24th section of the act of March, 1803, for enrolling the militia proposes to punish the offences named as the court: may determine, notcxeccdhigailnc of. 85.000, or imprison ment with or without hard labor, or by both tine and imprisonment. The reference of Senator Morrill’s joint resolution, giving notice of the abrogation of the Canadian rcclproAy treatyto the Com mittee on Commerce, Is understood to indi cate the modification, not abrogation of the treaty.

Washington, Dee. 15, 1863. CONGRESSIONAL. PERSONAL. THE ARMY OP THE POTOMAC. COLORED TROOPS. Sax Fraxcisco, Dee. 15. FROM RESELDOM. New Tore, Dee. 15. — In the rebel Senate on the 10th inst., Wigfall offered a resolution, inquiring into the •treatment of prisoners, which was agreed to. A bill is pending in the Rebel Congress for the issue of $500,000,000 coupon bonds of the Confederate States, bearing interest at 6 per cent., and payable in 20 years. Mr. Foote, of Tenn., offered a resolution of inquiry into the expediency of government distinguishing in Its prisoners of war of’Af rican descent between those who enlisted in the North as freemen and those who enlisted as slaves in tho South, who had ' taken up arms and who on falling Into onr hands again became the property of their owners. Richmond - papers say of the 80,000 prison ers held in Richmond since the Ist of Janna. ry, 1803, 671 have died, which it considers a very small proportion. The Examiner says that prisoners ore fur nished daily with three-quarters of a pound of bacon, when the rebel troops in the ‘ field are only receiving one-quarter. The rebel Senate has passed a bill prohibit ing tho enrollment of substitutes in the army* Mr. Brown, of Miss., offered resolutions impressing all able-bodied whites into the army; requiring aliens to quit the couutiy within sixty days, or take np arms; to levy a direct tax on all lands and property, inclu ding Confederate notes, and to make the lat ter a legal tender after the expiration of six months; and to prohibit buying and selling fold and silver coin, or notes of banks in the fulled States, or United States Trcosuiy notes, daring the war, under a heavy penalty..

New York, Dee. 15.— The rebel Secretary of the Treasury's report, says the entire debt of the Confederacy in round nnmbers. Is $1,CC0,000,000, of which $800,000,000 are Trea sury notes, and $700,000,000 of these notes arc in circulation. The Secretary says that the amount needed to carry oh the Confederacy to the SOth of June, 1801, is $475,060,000, beside the amount of the undrawn appropriations of the last Congress, which reaches $47,600,000, and if the estimates are extended so.as to include tho entire rear of 1864, the amount will reach $3,427,000,000, which, says the hopeful Sec retary, “Congress is formally called upon to provide,".and so if the legs of the Confeder acy Inst so long, It will have at tho end of the year 1864, the debt of $2,500,000,000. IKE WAR IU TIHHESSEE, Washington, Dec. 151 —The Star furnishes the following in advance of its publication: •Telegrams were received here last evening, from Knoxville np to yesterday morning. General Foster had assumed command of the troops, to-day, under Burnside, and the lat ter had departed from the city for Cincinnati All was then quiet in tho vicinity of Knox ville. It was stated there, on tho authority of scouts and messengers,that much of Long street’s artillery and train had fallen into the hands of onr pursuing force, but this lacks confirmation. The region in which the pursuit Is now be ing mode is so far distant from tho telegraph ns to make it difficult to verify such state ments. . - Nashville, Dee. 15. —There is a rumor here that Gen. Sheridan, commanding tbc column in pursuit of Longstreet, encountered the rebel rear guard cast of KnoxvlUe and sus tained a heavy repulse, in which Gen. Siieri dair is said to havp been badly wounded. Tliis rumor is not generally credited at Gen. Rosecrans' headquarters, but Is traced to several distinct sources. Unless corroborated by dispatches from Chattanooga of this date, the story may be discredited. Gen. J. M. Palmer, resigned, commanding 14th Corps, and had reached Bridgeport on his way home, when ho received orders to return to Chattanooga, his resignation not having been accepted. Col. Misener reports from Columbia that rebel deserters and citizens are flocking to that point in great numbers, asking to bo al lowed to take the oath under the President’s proclamation. Cok M. says, in rtgard to tho nnmbers arriving, that he* has never seen the like, until a few days ago. A Capt* Perkins, of the ilth Tennessee cavalry, has applied to Gen. Rosecrans for permission to take the oath of allegiance under the amnesty proclamation. He says' in his letter tljat the actual position of Ten nessee is not nndrstood or appreciated by the Tennesseeans in the rebel army, and that his eyes have been opened onlj*sincc his capture. The triid of Frank Gurley, the guerilla who killed Gen. McCook a year ago. Is now being concluded. He will undoubtedly be hung. Horace Maynard, Attorney General of 'the State, declares. In a published letter, that the usual county elections ore to bo held in March next In the State. TEE WAR HIV 

NORTH CARO - XAKA. New Xork, Dec. 15.—A New York Tantt letter, dated “In Camp, near Portsmouth, Virginia,” says: Brigadier General Wild, commanding the colored troops in this De partment, has undertaken a most important expedition. His brigade left this vicinity on Saturday last, in two taking a route through Princess Ann county, via Kcmpsville and Great Bridge, the other fol lowing the tow-path of the Dismal Swamp Canal, which has, for some months, been outside of our lines. The columnsunited at Kuttonsvllle, North Carolina, whence 4m ad vance was made on Elizabeth City, which was occupied yesterday without opposition. A dispatch dated this morning at camp, near Portsmouth, V., states that the rebel citizens were taken completely by surprise. Elizabeth City will be made the base of im portant operations. A detachment of 55 men from the Ist U. S. Colored Regiment has just returned, bringing in 20 wagon Toads of contrabands that had sought protection of ' Gen. Wild on the road. A force of artillery and cavalry from Gen.-Getty’s Division, as well ns considerable naval force, have left to' co-operate with Gen. Wild. FROM CHARLESTON. Washington, Dec. 15.—A letter from Mor ris Island says the rebels arc working very hard on Sullivan’s Island, increasing their works and shelling Forts Gregg and Wagner. The rebel iron-clads occasionally showed themselves, but were always careful to avoid a light. The rebels arc said to bo very sav age, and do not spare onr men when they catch them. Rcconnoissonccs arc frequently made from onr licet, and much valuable in formation obtained. Our forces arc not idle. OUR RICHMOND PRISON ERS. Washington, Dee. 15.—Though Gen. But ler and a member of the Sanitary Commis sion, now at Fortress Monroe, have telegraph ed to the government here that the rebel au thorities have stopped the distribution of supplies sent to the Union prisoners In their hands, we arc notified that up to this time no information had reached Washington indi cating anything like an official rebel notice had been communicated to either Gen. But ler or Gen. Meredith. . The fact that Onld, the rebel Commission er of Exchange, promptly replied yesterday or the day before to Gen. Butler’s tender of Tcccinc matter to be issued among the Union prisoners, that it “would bo disposed of promptly as required,” leads us to hope there may be a mistake. THE WAR IN YIRGIAU.

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. SENATE. Wasuixotox, Dee. 13. Mr. *WILSON, of Moss., presented a me morial asking for an increase of pay for pay master’s clerks, hospital stewards, and in spectors of customs in-Boston. Mr. LANE, of Kansas, introduced, on leave, a bill, providing Sec. I—That all' traffic m gold, silver and for eign exchange, for speculative purposes, or the purchase through a Broker by depositing less then tbc fall amount of the purchase, or on what Is known as a margin, is expressly prohibited. Sect. 2—Prohibits the sale of gold, silver, or foreign exchange by any Banker orßrokcr, direct ly or indirectly, at any place except at iho regular Socking house or Broker’s office. Sec. 2—Prohibits the srfle of gold, silver, or foreign exchange, unless actually delivered and paid for on delivery. Sec. 4.—Provides as the penalty for violating any of the provisions of the act, on conviction be fore the united States District Court, in the district where the offense Is committed, a flue of not less than one or more Hum ten thousand dol lars, and Imprisonment for not less than one or more than twelve months for each tffcnsc. j See. E—Gives the informer half the flue. * Mr, FOOT of Vt. Introduced a bill grant ing public lands to the Peoples’ Pacific Rail road and Telegraph line by the northern route- and asked that the.bill be referred to a select committee of the House. The SPEAKER hud before the House a message from the President, cordially recom mending that Copt. Rogers, who captnredthe Fin gall, for his distinguished zeal, bravery and general good conduct, receive a vote of thanks from Congress, this preliminary be ing required by law in order that he may be advanced one grade in the ziavy. The 

SPEAKER said he found on his table a letter from J. L. Riddle, signing himself Governor elect of Louisiana, notifying him of the resignation of Thes. Coltmon, a member of the House, bat as the latter's name does not appear on the rolls of theHonse, the com munication was not laid before the House. -Motions of reference of the respective sub jects embraced in the President's Message were then entertained, and the same were referred to the appropriate committees. Mr. 

LANE, of and., introduced a bill to amend the act entitled “An act to define and punish conspiracies," passed July Slat, 1861; also, the 24th section of the “Act for enroll ing and calling out the national forces," passed March So, 1863. Mr. HENDRICKS, of Ind., introduced a bill to extend' the time in which States may avail themselves of the grant of land for Agricultural and Industrial Colleges. Ms. DAVIS of- Ky., called up the resole tions in relation to the exchange of prison ers, arguing vehemently against the policy of refusing to exchange onr suffering white sol diers, the languishing, starving and .diseased white men because the rebels refuse to ex change tho negro captives. He denounced at length the policy of tho Administration upon the several points In which the negro Is affected, characterizing its position as mons tions and' referring to the present era as the reign or Abraham. First. He averred that his own loyalty was unspotted; that ho hated with undying vigor the crime of secession. It was evident that this policy was only apartofthe design to perpetuate Tho party power of the Adminis tration. He closed with on Indignant and earnest protest against refusing to liberate thousands of starving and dying white men for the sake of a few negroes. Mr. 

JOHNSON deemed it perfectly clear that humanity, which is the highest polity, demanded tho continuance of the exchange of prisoners.- He proceeded to combat the opinions of the Senrtor from Kentucky (Mr. Davis) that these men should not be protect-' ed. He corrected his views of the power of -the President by quoting from the Constitu tion relative to the executive and legislative powers. % Mr. 

DAVIS replied, saying the preamble of the Constitution confers no power on the gov ernment. The Supreme Conrt had so inter preted it. He also claimed the President had no right to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, which was a legislative, not executive, func tion. The powers to be exercised arc con ferred by the Constitution alone, and there ore no powers vested in the government which •arc not conferred by the Constitution, hence the President cannot raise troops or afmics, nor has ho the power to organize any meas ure to put down insurrection without the as sent of Congress. It was the determination of the party in power that the war shall con tinue till the next Presidential election. Tbc war wo d have been brought to a close long ago if the Administration had singly and In good faith devoted Itselfto the principles announc ed in the Crittenden resolution, and if the ■commanders of the armies had not been se lected, not because of their hostility to tho rebels, but because of their opposition to slavery. Mr. 

HALE, of‘N. H., arose to indignantly deny that it was the design of gentlemen on this floor to continue the war in order to in fluence the next Presidential election. A more atrocious allegation against honor able men was never listened to from the be ginning of time to the present moment. If the allegations of the Senator itcre tree, he would sooner take into his own hands the band of a roan from the charnel house, reck ing with pestilence, than tho hands of those around him; If tbc allegation was true every Senator was stamped with tho foulest treason and perjury. The destinies of the country have been submitted to tho gen tlemen around him, who are hound by their oath to sustain the country and the constitu tion, end to defend the firesides and homes threatened by invasion. The Senator from Kentucky says they are hypocrites and do not mean to sustain these objects. Mr. 

DAVIS explained that he had refer ence to those In power. Mr. HALE replied that the Senator had made rfn allcgatiSn which embraced every Senator. It was on allegation which, if true, would disgrace the vilest inmates of a peni tentiary. The character of the President was also assailed id* this allegation. He be lieved that one thing met everbody’s assent, that Mr* Lincoln is eminently an honest, pa triotic man. To-day, for the first time, be > had heard the honesty and patriotism of tbc Executive questioned. If Mr. Lincoln has colled for black soldiers to take np arms, and calls them out to light the battles of the country, it is bound to firotcct them at dll hazards, by every agency t can put forth. The government having used them, and they Laving become prison ers, if they are abandoned to their fate it is guilty of baseness unheard of In history. The party in powerhas one aim and that alm is the country: but one purpose, and that Is fhc salvation of the country. The idea that the Administration and its supporters desire the continuation of the war in order to control the next Presidential election; desire this cruel war, with Its cries of anguish, our sons given to slaughter, onr widows in mourning, and our kindred to destitution, is .an insinuation so hose that he wondered it found Its way even into the fertile brain of the Senator from Kentucky. [Applause In the galleries.] Mr. 

LANE, of Indiana, remarked that ho understood the Senator from . Kentucky to say a Mtyor. General had declared it was pro posed by the President to retain his power even though the election go against him. If that be tree tho administration, does not de serve the confidence of the conutry; if false, the officer should be mustered out, as un worthy the commission he bears. He should like to know the name of tho officer. Mr. 

DAVIS replied that the Senator mis took a gentleman who was formerly a mem-, ber of the other House, and informed him there was a Major General who said, if Lin coln was defeated in the next Presidential election, he would not surrender the office. If the. Senator from Indiana (Lane) would come to him (Davis,) iu the strictest confi dence, he would give.him the name of the Major General and that of his informant Mr. LANE had only to say that any Maj. Gen eral who would make such a. statement was unworthy the honors of the Government. If true, the Government was unworthy of con fidence. As one of the supporters of the Government, he denied that t any such rc mark was true. The pending resolution of Hr. Daria was referred to the Military Committee. After on executive session, the Senate ad journed, HOUSE. Mr/STEVENS of Fa. introduced a scries of resolutions referring the various branches of the President’s Message to the appropriate Committees, and that port with reference to the treatment and condition of the rebellious States to a Select Committee of nine, to be appointed by the Speaker. Mr. DAVIS of sid. offered as a substitute, that so much of the President’s Message as relates to the duty of the United States to guarantee to every State a Republican form of. government, and to those States in which the Government has been abrogated or over thrown, to a Select Committee of nine, who shall report the bills necessary to carry into effect this duty. Mr. 

BROOKS, of New Tork, said that If th c proposition of Mr. Davis should bo per sisted in, he should be disposed to add that this special committee also inquire whether a Republican Government has not been abro-. gated and overthrown in the North aswollas m the South, since thcrevolution began? Mr. LOVEJOY, of Illinois, said that in spite of certain invividnals, there still exists a Republican Government in all the States of the North, without infringement or 'abate ment. He was for the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was. He - would dispos sess the slaveholders of the Union as he would those who had seized the Chesapeake, and he wanted to put a loyal crew on board and sail the good ship Union as our lathers framed it. The'substitute ot Mr..DAVIS was adopted. Tees, 89; nays, 80. On motion of Mrf COX, of Ohio, it was resolved that the seven additional standing committees, nppointcdundermle No. 10*3, he directed at once to perform the dnties pre scribed by said rule, and examine into the stale of the accounts and expenditures of the several Departments respectively submitted to them, and report particularly, as specified in said rule; and* further, that said commit-, tees have all the powers of Committees of Investigation. All or Mr. STEVENS’ resolutions as modi fied were then agreed to. On motion of Mr. COX, of Ohio, the .fol lowing resolution introduced by him yester day was adopted. Meed ted. That the Secretary of War bo directed ito communicate to this Bouse the report made by Major Gen. McClellan concerning the organization and operations of the Army of the Potomac while under bis command, and of ail army operations while he was Commander in-Chlcf. The House then adjourned. • Beginning of 'the End. New York, Dee. 14.— The New York Tribune has private, advices from (Havana, that secessionists there have given over the rebel cause as hopeless.
