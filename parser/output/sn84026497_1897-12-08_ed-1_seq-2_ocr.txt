THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. i. C. WtNKi lOlTOS PdOHIITOI. WEDNESDAY, DEC EMBER 8, 18W. PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S MESSAGE. The message of President McKin ley to the Fifty-fourth Congresa was read in both Houses Monday aud is considered one of the solidesl of state papers. All the impor ant subjects relating to the state of the Union are touched up in a manner that inspires till greater con6'lence in the wise and businesslike administration of Mr. McKioloy. The document is quite lengthy, precluding the publi cation of even a brief summary in the Republican at this time. The Oil City Derrick has this to say of the message : President McKinley' message to the Fifty-fifth Congress is the able, strong, conservative and statesman like document that the people bad every reasoo to expect ironi such a ource. Must of the recomendations contain uothing new, as he made no secret of his convictions on tha public questions of the day, and the Nation has been thoroughly acquainted with bis views in regard to Cuba, Hawaii, and the currency question ever since be made his inaugaral address. Iu respect to Cuba he believes our wisest and best course lies in keeping our bauds off, and that it is no more than just to ask for a sessaticm of p'ib lio owinion and popular clamor until Spain has another uppertuuity to set tle the affair! of her own household. The granting of bellingerent rights would only complicate matters with out affording any real relief to the Cuban cause. Mr. McKinley'g vigorous words on the Hawaiian problem will commend themselves to every patriotic Ameri can. Annexation is the only salva tion tor tbe islands, and the requests of that far-away little republic to lorm au integral part of our great national domain should not be suf fered to go uuheeded. These are pop ular sentiments and Congress will do well to act without delay. Hawaii comes to us without mouey and with out price. io other nation das any claims upon her and her fate isinsep erably linked with our own. We can suffer oo other foreigo power to take possession of her, and Bhe is not strong enough to maintain lierselt among tbe governments of the world. Upon the financial question Mr. McKinley dwells at some length. lie shows the penificent workings of the Dingley tariff and tbe improved con ditioo of the National finances. He urges tbe adoption of a measure of curreocy reform, and strongly eudors es Secretary Gage's plan. This means the retirement of the legal lenders and the enlargement of the National Daolt system. It is unfortunate, at this time, that the President has not back of him a working majority iu the Senate. Tbe House can be de pended upon to bo its duty, but the Senate is likely to oppose Mr. Gage's scheme for currency reform with great vigor and obstinacy. With the tariff question settled Mr McKinley places next in importance this matter of currency reform. He recognizes that our presperity, to be permanent, must rest on a firm and substantial basis.and that the Nation al credit must not again be exposed to the dangers of a gold panic. While there is oppertunity for a diversity of opinion upon this subject there is lit tle doubt that the majority of the people are with the President, aud willing and eager to see all his rec ommendations carried out by Con grew aod put in practical working oader. If the Seuate and the House are desirous of obeying the wishes of their constituents they will begin their work without delay aod prose cute it to a speedy and successful conpletion. 

ABOUT PENSION. In last night's Warren Democrat ap- sears the following : "Oue in every seventy of our population is now on the pension mil. That is to say, of every fourteen families iu tbe United States one family is partially or whol ly supported by the government." Well, do you begrudge the money that is being paid the pensioner ? Such squibs would indicate that you did, says the Kane lirpublican. Sup posing the men who went out in the sixties aod bared their breasts to the bullets of the rebels who were at tempting to annihilate this govern ment, had refused to go, what then ? The government had power to force men into tbe service, but it didn't have tbe power to make their fighting effective. Do yon believe that if our soldiers bad not thrown the greatest efforts of their young lives into that terrible contest you would be doing successful business to-day in one of the most thriving small cities of tbe .State ? Tbe following article ap peared recently in the Pittsburg Timet and in this connection is quite appropriate : With the approach of the meeting of congress and the publication of ad vance extracts from the reports of the beads of tbe departments comes the usual annual kick Iron) some sources regarding tbe expenditure of money for pensions. It is true that pensious take some money, but the men who are getting them earned what they get. The United States escaped easy with its payment to the men who faugbt the battles of the Civil war. The nation hired men for $13 a month to stand up and be shot at, when the average man at bome could earn three times as much working in tbe railroad construction eansr. If tbe country had paid current wages, tbe 2,ddU,U00 men who served in the war, taking the figures ou a three year basis, would hast) received fully $1,250,000,000 more pay than they did. II they bad been in proportion to tbe hazardous nature of the work they would have been given a mort gage on the Union at the start. There is not much occasion to com plain of the pension roll. Leaving nut oi consideration that tbe money paid was earned long ago, tbe man who objects to paying pensions has an easy way to avoid it. The income of the government is received from liquor, tobacco, oleomargarine, playing cards aud import duties. He who is averse to pensions cau be sure he pays none of i hem if he will eschew liquor, keep bis hands on playiag cards, avoid to nacco and buy bis goods trotn an American mill or factory, thus en cotiraging American industry. There is no tax collector to bold us up, as is the case with state, county and oth er taxes. The man who, is paying the pensioners is the man who uses for eign goods, or pays his taxes at the bar or at the tobacco store. And as a rule, these are not the ones who are doing most of tbe complaining. Not one of the thirteen countries which offered "protests" against our new tariff has excluded any American products because their protests were unheeded. Iurtead of shutting out our products the thirteen protesting coun tries have increased their purchases of our products twenty-five per cent, while we have, under the operations of the Dingley law, reduced our pur chases from them in a like propor tion. The United States as a whole is following the example which the farmers of the country set in utilizing their first earnings for a reduction of their mortgage iudehtcduess. Less of Americao securities are now being held abroad than at any lime in the past quarter of a century, thus show ing that the country, like the citi zens, is reducing as rapidly as pns ble the amount which it mutt pay to others for interest on indebtedness. That much-talked of visit of Mr. Bryan to Mexico is now to begin. The Mexicans are to he told, presum- bly iu their native tongue, how much better off they are with a free coinage system, iu which it takes two and a half silver dollars to buv an article which one silver dollar under the lim ited coinage system of the United States will buy, and on his return to tbe United Stutes Mr. Bryan is to ex plain to the people of this country the advantages which would come to them by exchanging our currency system with its 23 one-hundred-cent dollars per capita for the Mexican system of 5 forty cent dollars per cap ita. The public will anxiously await this somewhat remarkable undertak ing of this somewhat remarkable finan cier. See what a nice wrap you can buy at Miles t Armstrong's. Wouldn't they make a nice present T It. McKinley times are evidently ap predated by tho people of Kansas, who have returned her to the column of Republican States, the plurality of the party in that Stale being this year over 9,000, against a Democrat ic plurality of over 13,000 in the election of 1896. Nancy Allibon McKinley. the venerable mother of President Mc Kinley, is lying at death's door at ber home in Canton, Ohio. The aged mother was stricken with paralysis on Thursday last since which ber life bas been slowly ebbing. Her child ren, including tbe President, have been almnBt constantly at ber bedside since ber illness began. She is up ward of 86 years of age. Death is hourly exected, aud perhaps before tbis is read her soul will have passed over. A ton of canceled farm mortgages is proposed as an interesting exhibit at the Traos-Missisaippi Exposition. Tbe farmers of the entire Mississippi valley couldeasily arrange this, but wouldn't it be pretty hard on Mr. Bryan, right in bis own State aud uu der the shadow of his own editorial sanctum ? The funny newspaper fellow who annually announces as a gn at joke that "we have Congress on hands again," is just now iu bis elemeut. Spanish prisons in Cuba have giv en up every American citizen within their walls since the incoming of the McKinley administration. Aod yet there are people who have the assur ance to complain of tbe attitude of of the administration in regard to Cuba. The foreign countiies go right on buying from us notwithstanding tbe great reduction in our purchases from them under the Dingley tariff law Our sales to them have increased 25 per cent, under the new law compared with the corresponding months of last year. The tin plate manufacturers of the Uuited States will, it is believed.soou he actively competing iu the Euro peau markets with the tin plate mak ers of ales, who less than a decade ago were supplying not only all of Europe, hut all of the United States Will the Democrats claim this as an other evidence of the accuracy of their theory that low tariff' cultivates a foreign market for our productions hie new tariff law presents its compliments to its framers on their return to Washiugtou with an evi dence of a steady grow th in earnings They were in August $1!,023,G14, in beptember $21,'J33,0H8, iu October 824,3!il1415, and iu November $25 000,000. That is a Heady, healthful growth, which indicates that long be tore its first year has ended it will be producing the promised surplus. Mlt. JJry AN made no effort duiint his four years in Congress to uhtain legislation upon the subjects which he now so uproarouBly supports as the chief features of his political faith. He had not a word to say about ar bitration, government by injunction, anti trust legislation, or any of the other subjects ou which he now ap peals to the public. But of course he indorses all of them now that the party advocates them. W. L.
