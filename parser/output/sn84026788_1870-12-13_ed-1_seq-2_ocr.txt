Jfpijjit -flf IMLGAItNjfc HAINES. PubmWrs; OHAELESTOWN, TA. Tuesday Morning, Dcccmber 13, 1870. ^TfiEOMTY 3EAT; t% f - ? We publish to-day a petition which has Seen put in circulation for signature by the people of tho county, for the removal of the county seat back to Charlestown. We suppose every one who rccognizes the injustice that was done by the change which transferred the seat of the county government from this plnee to the present location, will not hesitate to affix his namo to this paper, and actively employ whatever influence he may wield to hrduce others to do the same thing. The propriety of the action proposed is so appa rent that it is very difficult to present argu? ment in its favor, beyond the mere statement of the case itself. The facts are so few and so simple, and all tend so irresistibly to one oonolusten, that when the case is stated it hag been fully argued, and there in nothing more to be said about it. The petition to which wo have called attention, it seems to us, con tains all that should bo required to satisfy any fair mind that the legislative action solicited should be granted. It informs tho Legisla ture of the State that, without any consulta* tion with the people of the connty?during the pondency of the war, and contrary to their known wishes?the county seat was changed from Charlestown, where it was originally lo cated and where for more than sixty years, and from the very foundation of the county, it had been established?a point near the geographical centre of the county, and enjoy ing the advantages of a railroad and tho con vergence of nearly all the turnpikes and main roads of the county?to Shepherdstown, on the Northern boundary of the county, inac cessible to travel, and subjecting to great in convenience eight-tenths of the people of the county. The petition furtherscts forth that the pub lic property, which was originally dedicated to the public uses, still remains, and could, by the expenditure of a much less sum than would bo required at any other convenient point, be reoccupied as the county seat. It seems to us that but little, if anything more need bo said on the subject, although we arc aware that there are objections urged to the proposed action. These we will notice in a subsequent number of our paper, and we think that wo will be able to show that "they are trifles light as air," compared with the weighty considerations for the change, which are briefly sot forth in the paper to which at tention has been called. 

VIRGINIA, vs. WEST VIRGINIA, The question of the right of Virginia to jurisdiction over the counties of Jefferson and .Berkeley, will be argued before the Supremo Court of the United States in February nest, and as we arc not aware of anything that can be accomplished by newspaper articles on the subject, we drop it for the present. The case is in the hands of the judiciary and not of the public press, and will beyond doubt bo deci ded without regard to flaming editorials or anonymous contributions, either pro or con. - ? ? ???.?? ? .... Tlie President's Message. Comments of the Pi ess. From ths Waafiingtcn Patriot. Wo expected little from General Grant, and have not been disappointed in the tedious and disjointed document which he communicated to Congress yasterday. It is manifestly tho production of several inferior minds, and has no dominating thought, nor even common fe licity of expression, to relieve its dullness.? As a mere literary production it falls far be low the level of mediocrity, and, as a State paper, it descredits the dignity of our docu mentary history. Like its putative author, it will only be remembered hereafter in the dreary chronology of the partisan times. Frotn the New York World. So fur as this message deviates from com monplace and dull historical statement, it de viates into extravnsrancc. '-He who forsakes the probable." says some critic, "will easily find the marvelous." The statesman who lets ?ro his hold on common sense will have no dif ficulty in hitting upon something odd. It re quired a genius like Grant to discover that the true way to settle the Alabama claims is to pay them ourselves; that to relieve our fishermen we must cripple our railroads ; that a treaty which has been rejected by the Sen ate can be replaced by another trent>/ negotia ted by commissioners authorized by Congress, and that this second treat)/ can he made valid without ratification by tho Senate! Was there ever such another bundle of crudities ? From the N. Y. Tribune. The President's summing up of the leading objects of his policy, and especially his desire to sceure "a pura untrammeled ballot." must appeal cogently to the judgment and affections of the American people. lie is abraham Lin coln's lineal successor, and tho popular heart beats in unison with his aspirations and his efforts From the N. Y. Timee. The message transmitted yesterday by the President to Congress is tho best answer to those who insist that tho mission of the Ile publican party is ended, or who impugn Gen eral Grant's fitness for interpreting the wishes and promoting the interests of the people.? Tho policy set forth is at once positive and practical. From the New York Herald. It is a good State paper and a staunch party platform. From the N. Y. Herald (Wash. Corrcapomiencc.) The President's message is the absorbing subject of conversation in Washington to night. So far as can be ascertained from the criticism it receives, it is regarded as able and adroit. Takcu as a whole it is generally commended, especially so by the Republicans, but disap pointment is expressed that the President said so much upon points which it is thought f-boulu have had little more than a passing reference, and said so little upon others which tire deemed of more vital iuterest and impor tance. Frroi the Nf.w York Sun. The first thought that occurs to one after reading the message is that it is a poverty stricken document. It tells us much that we already knew, but leaves us in the dark on subjects about which we would like to be in formed. Ffom the Philadelphia Ag-o. In tone and Fpirjt, it is a paltry Stale poper. Meeting of the Virginia Legislature Governor's Message. Richmond, December 7.?The Legislature met this morning, and the message of Gov ernor Walker was read. Ho says: Never before, in the nistory of the Commonwealth, has a Legislature assembled upon which de volved graver responsibilities than upoo you. On the finances, he reiterates his views ex pressed in his inaugural on the 8th of March last. He is strengthened in the correctness of the recommendations then made, and says they have been heartily endorsed by the best financiers both in this country and England. Had the Legislature promptly adopted them the State debt would have been reduced over ten millions of dollars, and the depreciated credit advanced from fifty to Dinety cents on the dollar. In regare to the settlement of the debt betweep Virginia and West Virginia, he says the obvious meaning and intent of all legislation on this subject by each State is that what amount the State of West Virginia ought to assume should be paid into the Treasury of the State of Virginia, to be by her used in the extinguishment of the original debt. The bonds arc the bonds of Virginia, not of West Virginia, and to theTrcasury of Virginia do the creditors look for the payment of their debts. There is but one sovereign remedy for the financial evil that afflicts us. and, in his opinion, that remedy is a strict fulfilment of our solemn obligations. The better course to be pursued is for both States to submit the whole question to arbitration. If all your honorable means fail, you have but one remedy left you?the Supremo Court of the United States. On the organization of the State militia he speaks at groat length, and says that if, in the late municipal difficulties, he had had control of a single eompauy of well organized and equipped militia, the Executive would have been enabled to have quelled that disgraceful and most unjustifiable insurrection agaiust the laws of the Commonwealth. In regard to certain farms in tidewater Vir ginia, and on which, after the war, by au thority of the Freedman's Bureau, a larce number of colored people had settled, and for whoso removal a military force had become necessary, the Governor is pointed. A de tachment of troops which had been sent by General Barry from Fortress Monroe, to as sist the Sheriff of Norfolk county, was, with out any explanation, recalled. Ho says: I feel bound to say, in view of the circum stances, the sudden withdrawal of thc3e troops, endangering the lives of our officers and citi zens and the peace of the community, was, in my opinion, an act of official discourtesy and a manifestation of indifference of the gravest character, without a parallel in the history of this couutry. He also disconrscs on the subject of the boundary line of the State ; od the peniten tiary, and concludes in the following char acteristic style : "In obedience to law, in the maintenance of order and the performance of all the duties appertaining to good citizenship, the people of Virginia challenge comparison with any State in the Union, Everywhere within the broad limits of the Commonwealth every citizen is safe with his life, liberty and pursuit of happi ness. . Emerging trom the terrible ordeal 01 a lour years' baptism of blood, stripped of everything save incorrupt honor, the peopie of this Com monwealth have airain resumed their place in the Uniou of their fathers, with an earnest purpose and a fixed determination to fulfil all the obligations of American citizens. Moro cannot be required of them ; less they will not perform. Tho Word White. A very striking illustration of the immo vable attachment of the people to the word "rr/life," and at the same time an unmistak abcle proof of the correctness of the Demo cratic doctrine, are furnished in the resnlt of the rcccnt election in Michigan. When that State was organized. Democratic views were in the ascendant, and as in the case of Penn sylvania, a provision was inserted in the Con stitution confining the suffrage to white peo ple. At the late election an amendment was voted on to strike out that provision, so as to make the organic law of the State accord with the celebrated Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, but the amendment was voted down and tho word lr/iilc was left standing by a majority of three thousand. AVhen it is remembered that Mich igan is a decidedly Radical State, this action of her people, while it evinces their good taste and judgment., and furnishes an emphatic tribute to the justness of Democratic ideas, must by the Radicals. be regarded as tho "most unkindest cut of all." And what is to be done? Tho people of Michitrail, though Radical to the core, are opposed to negro suf frage, and have setup their State Constitution in the face of the amended Constitution of the United States,?Pittsburg 1'uprr. JUS" Some idea of the dreadful carnage of the late civil war may be inferred from the fact stated officially that the bodies of 312, 515 dead soldiers have been collected and interred at national expense. In addition to these there are many thousands whose bodies were taken home and buried by their familicsi and probably thousands moro whose names swelled the list of the "missing" after the battle. It is scarcely an extravagant estimate which places upon the muster roll of the Fed eral dead 500.000 men. IIow much can be said for the geueralship of tho leader who lost more soldiers than his enemy commanded ? SSy* A writer from St. Petersburg says that a war-like feeling prevails throughout the Russian Empire. It is remarked that Russia is committed to a bold line of conduct, and is resolved to carry it out despite all oppo sition. A feeling of universal joy was created at Sebistopol on the receipt of the news of GortschakofT's circular.

FBANCE AND PRUSSIA. From the condensed news column of the Baltimore Gazette, we make up the following summary :? ?Wednesday's news. Official reports have been received by the Government at Tours, From Paris in relation to the operations of General Dderot. Accounts of successes by the French troops had created the wildest enthusiasm in the city. It was claimed that, after losing fifteen or twenty thousand men in the contests at Champigny and in front of Villiers, the Prussians were so much weakened that they suffered the French to cross the Marne unopposed. The King of Prussia has telegraphed the Queen, under date Versailles, Suudav mid night, that after two day's fighting the St. Jean Railway Stalon, a suburb ol Orleans, with thirty guns and one thousand prisoners, had bean captured with "moderate loss" by the Prussians. THURSDAY'S NEWS. In the late battles before Orleans it ap pears that the Prussians attacked each corps d'armee in superior force, thus feptflsitig the Army of the Loire, turning the position so as to render the evacuation of the city necessary. General Paladines retreated with a force thought to be two hundred thousand strong, having Gve hundred catinon. It is stated that he fought to the utmost, but was powerless to effect anything, But few prisoners were cap tured by the Prussians, and no ammunition. News has been received at Tours, by balloon t from Paris, to tho 4th, which goes to confirm previous favorable accounts of the state of af fairs there. The morale of the troops is spo ken of as being excellent. Trochu, in a pub lished statement of the late operations, claims that the Prussians were repulsed, without ef fecting their objects, both at Villiers and Cham pinny, and also at Nojrent; that General Ducrot bivouacked at Vincennes on the night of the 3d. Prince Goorge telegraphs to the King of Saxony that further offensive movements on the part of the besieged Parisians were im? possible. The total loss of the Saxons was seventy-six officers and twenty one hundred men. Friday's news. The King of Prussia has telegraphed the Queen that the city of Orleans was occupied by his forces on the night of the 4th, without being stormed. A flag of truce, announcing the capture of Orleans and the rout of the Army of the Loire, has been sent into Paris by the Prussians. The main body of General Ducrot's army is reported to be in position at Gretell, between the Seine and Marne. protected by the 2tins of Fort Charenton. The Army of the Loire is on the left bank of the river, seeking to ef fect a junction with the Ariny of the Fast, reported as beitiir <30.000 strong. This effect ed. it is proposed that tho combined army shall move towards Fontainbleau. SATURDAY'S NEWS. A despatch frnm Tours says that Govern ment lias declared that its reverses were of only temporary importance, that the Army of tile Loire Was at its old quarters, and that the evacuation of (Jrleans was caused by the de moralization of some new troops and the mis taken strategy and indecision of General Pa ladines King William has written to his Queen confirming the capture, by him, of ten thou sand prisoners seventy seven cannon, and four 1 gun boats at Orleans. Gidy and Jauney had ; been stormed and captured, and Rouen occu | pied after a victorious encounter. | Tt is announeed from Rerlin that King William has accepted tho title of Emperor of Germany. Great enthusiasm prevailed in j consequence. A letter of King Louis, of | Bavaria, to the King of Saxony is published, in which he invites all the German Princes to urge the King of Prussia to assume the Im perial title united with the Presidental func tions. Monday's news. J It is reported that the Germans under Prince ! Frederick Charles and the Duke of Mecklen burg, in strong force, attacked the French all I along their lines on the night of the Sfh, the S principal effort being at Beaogoncy- Accord ; ing lo General Ghauzey's report to the War j Department at Tours, they were repulsed with I heavy loss and driven beyond Grand Ghartres. Accounts from Versailles represent that the j Prussians still in pursuit of the Army of the | Loire overtook and defeated its rear guard, j which seems to have consisted of the Third I Corps, on the 8th. The Gorni'in losses were j severe, but those of (he French are said to have been heavier. Tho array was obliged, it is added to hasten its retreat A despatch received from London at an early hour this morning rsports that Gambetta has asked for an armistice, to enable a Na tional Assembly to be elected. He admits j that he has lost hope of prosecuting the war j to a successful issue, that the Anuy of the j Loire has been beaten in detail, and'declines j the responsibility of a further struggle or of : making peace. An Assembly, he says, must 1 decide. Election o? a Democratic Senator in 1 Alabama. ?

Goldthwaite received one majority over all cast, and was declared elected for six years from March next. Forester, seated yesterday, voted for Warner. A Democrat fras absent, being sick, and two Republicans were in the city, not voting. Goldthwaite has been a Judge of the Circuit and Supreme Courts, is an able lawyer, and has been a citizen nf Montgomery county for over forty yeajs. The people are greatly , rcjoiced. The disabilities of the Senator elect, Goldth ; waite, were removed by act of Congress. Washington, Dee. 8.?The bill which I General Butler proposes to call up on Tuesday excludes members of the Confedarate Congress, | former members of the United States Congress, graduates of West Point, and those whotleft the Federal army and navy to join the rebel lion, also Confederate Cabinet officers. But ler informed a Democratic member to-day that when the amnesty bill comes up he will I allow the largest latitude for debate and J amendments, and will not attempt to force : the bill through under call of the previous i question. J6T- A resolution impeaching William H. ' Holden, Governor of North Carolina, of high | crimes and misdemeanors, has been intro j dnced in the House of representatives of that ! State, and referred to the Judiciary Commit : tee. A movement is seriously contemplated I in Virginia, having for its effect the nomina ' tion of Governor Gilbert C. Walker, of that State, as the democratic candidate for Vice A Buried Woman Comes to Life. We are indebted to A. E. Steinmetz, of this city, for particulars of a case id real life, which, in the elements of the marvelous, is Tally equal to the productions of the story writers, and furnishes another substantiation of the fruism, that "truth is stranger than fiction." A young lady about 20yearsof age?Margaret Anderson, by name?catne to this city about a year ago; she came with a company of rela tives and friends from Denmark, and lived here until about the first of July last. The male members of the family found employ ment on the line of the Union Pacific Road, and found it convenient to remove their domi cile nearer to the place of their work j conse quently, n part of the family tuoved out to Big Springs station, on the Pacific Road, and among those who went was Margaret. Hero **ery7hing Went on pleasabtfy, till about the 1st of September, when Margaret was taken sick, and after a severe illness of about two weeks, she bade them tiood-by. and her spirit took its Sight to that bourne whence no tral eler returns. At least, so the situation pre sented itself to her sorrowing friends, and to all human appearances nobody was evermore really dead, and no case more hopelessly "past all surgery." The same day that she died, the frinds at Dig Springs wrote to the rela tives in this city, giving particulars of her sickness and death. On the second day after she had apparently breathed her last, a rude colli? was provided, and the friends concluded that the remains should be temporarily interred upon the prairie until such time as would be more convenient to take them to a permanent resting place. I5ig Springs is simply a watering station on the Pacifiic Road?there is no settlement at the piece and nobody lives there but those em ployed by the company, consequently the last sad ri'es had to be performed by tlie members o1' her own family, and her body was laid to rest by,the hands of solffo#(ng ffieirds. But just as the coffin had been lowered to its rest ing place, and a few shovelsfull of earth thrown into the grave, an approaching train called the burial party to duty at the station. After an absence of an hour, the men returned to the grave, and as they were about to resume work with their shovels, they heard a noise in the partially buried coffiiu, giving evidence of kicking and pounding, and as may be supposed after recovering from their fright, the men lost do time in uncovering and opening the coffin, to see what had disturbed the dead woman's rest. The remainder of the story may be bet ter imagined than described. Suffice it to say that Margaret's friends and relatives in this city, who had mourned her as dead, have just received a letter written by her own hand, giving the story in detail and rejoicing over her narrow escape from being buried alive.
