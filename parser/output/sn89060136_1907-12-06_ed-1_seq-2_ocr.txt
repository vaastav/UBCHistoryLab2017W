PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT’S ANNUAL MESSAGE Legislation Which He Urges the Sixtieth Congress to Enact Washington, D. C. —Ths annual Message of the President was read before the opening session of the new Sixtieth Congress. Its reading was followed with intense interest by the members of the two houses and many passages were vigorously ap plauded. The Message is, in part, as follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: ’ No nation has greater resources than ours, and I think it can be truth fully said that the citizens of no na tion possess greater energy and in dustrial ability. In no nation are the fundamental business conditions sounder than in ours at this very mo ment; and it is foolish, when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keeping it in sound banks; for it is such hoarding that is the im mediate occasion of money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people is conducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to farms and factories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commer cial enterprises. In any large body of men, however, there are certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the. conditions are such that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are business men of great sagac ity and of temperament both unscru pulous and reckless, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many in nocent people into making invest ments or embarking in kinds of busi ness that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successfully dis honest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the mora painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wiss and proper to endeavor so far as possible to mini mize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ulti mate causes of the suffering, and, as, a means to this end, where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental pol icies; but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinch ing perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty. After making a lengthy extract from his message to Congress on De cember 5, 1905, in which are con tained his well known views on the subject of corporation regulation the President says that he calls attention to these quotations because he is sat isfied it is the duty of the National Government to embody in action the principles thus expressed. The Mes sage then continues: Np small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an extreme the national virtue of self reliance, of Independence in initia tive and action. It is wise to con serve this virtue and to provide for its fullest exercise, compatible with seeing that liberty does not become A liberty to wrong others. Unfortu nately, this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation lnevitab.ly breeds. The founders of the Constitution provided that the National Government should have complete and sole control of inter state commerce. There was then practically no interstate business _ save such as was conducted by water, and this the National Government at once proceeded to regulate in thor oughgoing and effective fashion. Conditions have now so' wholly changed that the interstate commerce by water is insignificant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstate com merce. As a result, it can be but partially and imperfectly controlled or regulated by the action of any one of the several States; such action in evitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax, and in either case ineffective for purposes of jus tice. Only the National Government can in thoroughgoing fashion . exer cise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of Federal authority, for such authority already exists under the Constitution in amplest and most far-reaching form; but it does mean that there should be an extension of Federal activity. This is not advo cating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face, and realiz ing that centralization la business has already come and can not be avoided or undone, and that the pub lice at large can only protect itself from certain evil effects of this busi ness centralization by providing bet ter methods for the exercise of con trol through the authority already centralized in the National Govern ment by the Constitution Itself. There must be no halt in the healthy constructive course of action which this Nation has elected to pursue, and has steadily pursued, during the last six years, as shown both in the legis ' latinn of the Congress and the admin istration of the law by the Depart ment of Justice.

Professor Earl Barnes tells the Mothers' Congress that bachelorhood tends toward criminality. The presence of Queen Alexandra in London, together with the Queens of Norway and Spain, added great zest to the season. need is in connection with the rail roads. As to these, in my judgment there should now be either a national incorporation act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in inter state commerce upon certain cohdi tions. The law should be so framed as to give to the Interstate Com merce Commission power to pass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means should be pro vided to enable the Commission, whenever in its judgment it is neces sary, to make a physical valuation of any railroad. As I stated in my Mes sage to the Congress a year ago, rail roads should be given power to enter into agreements, subject to these agreements being made public in mi nute detail and to the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission be ing first obtained. Until the Nation al Government assumes proper con trol of interstate commerce, in the exercise of the authority it already possesses, it will be impossible either to give to or to get from the railroads full justice. The railroads and all other great corpor ations will do well to recognize that this control must come; the only question is as to what governmental body can most wisely exercise it. The courts will determine the limits within which the Federal authority can exercise it, and there will still re main ample work within each State for the railway commission of that State; find the National Interstate Commerce Commission will work in harmony with the several State com missions, each within its own prov ince, to achieve the desired end. Moreover, in my judgment there should be additional legislation look ing to the proper control of the great business concerns engaged in inter state business, this control to be ex ercised for their own benefit and prosperity no less than for the pro tection of investors and of the gen eral public. As I have repeatedly said in Messages to the Congress and elsewhere, experience has definitely shown not merely the unwisdom but the futility of endeavoring to put a stop to all business combinations. Modern industrial conditions are such that combination is not only necessary but inevitable. It is so in the world of business just as it is so in the world of labor, and it is as idle to desire to put an end to all corporations, to all big combinations of capital, as to desire to put an end to combinations of labor. Corpora tion and labor union alike have come to stay. Each if properly managed is a source of gaod and not evil. Whenever in either there is evil, it should be promptly held to account; but it should receive hearty encour agement so long as it is properly managed. It is profoundly immoral to put or keep on the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public morality, that really puts a premium upon public immorality by undertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done under modern business conditions, so that the law itself provides that its own Infraction must be the condition pre cedent upon business success. Then the President, after making pertinent excerpts from his Message of last year, says: The anti-trust law should not be repealed; but it should be made both more efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should be so amended as to forbid only the kind of combinatidn which does harm to the general public, such amend ment to be accompanied by, or to be an incident of, a grant of supervisory I power to the Government over these big concerns engaged in interstate business. This should be accompan ied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the sub jection of books and papers to the inspection of the Government officials. The anti-trust law should not pro hibit combinations that do no injus tice to the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole of benefit to the public. But even if this feature of the law were abol ; lshed, there would remain. as an equally objectionable feature the dif ' Acuity and delay now incident to its ' enforcement. The Government must now submit to irksome and repeated | delay before obtaining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings insti tuted, and even a favorable decree may mean an empty victory. More over, to attempt to control these cor porations by lawsuits means to lm , pose upon both the Department of Justice and the courts an impossible burden; it is not feasible to carry | on more than a limited number of such suits. Such a law to be really effective must of course be adminis tered by an executive body, and not , merely by means of lawsuits. The design should be to prevent the , abuses incident to the creation of . unhealthy and improper combina . | tions, instead of waiting until they ; are in existence, and then attempting ! to destroy them by civil or criminal , proceedings. r | A combination should not be tol • erated if it abuse the power acquired • I by combination to the public detri : I ment. No corporation or association [ ! of any kind should be permitted to [ ! engage in foreign or interstate com . i merce that is formed for the purpose r of, or whose operations create, a . | monopoly or general control of the i production, sale, or distribution of > any one or more of the prime neces ’ sities of life or articles of general use [ and necessity. Such combinations are . against public policy; they violate ■ : the common law; the doors of the - courts are closed to those who are r parties to them, and I believe the ■ Congress can close the channels of . I interstate commerce against them for r , its protection. The law should make i | Its prohibitions and permissions as l j clear and definite as possible, leav t j lng the least possible room for aybi - I trary action, or allegation of such ac - tion, on the part of the Executive, or -of divergent interpretations by the I courts. Among the points to be aimed Brevities by Wire. r I American imports to China have - declined. j The official records for 1906 show - the lowest recorded birth rate in the -history of France. I The Druce case is an absorbing i topic in England, and at the hearings 1 in the police court great throngs are present. i Many famous novels are in danger s of being barred in the London schools t on the ground that they offend the l true moral sense. • at should be the prohibition of un ; healthy -competition, such as by ren [ dering service at.an actual loss for ; the purpose of crushing out competi . tlon, the prevention of Inflation of' - capital, and the prohibition of a cor ; poration’s making exclusive trade ■ with itself a condition of having any i trade with Itself. ReaSbnable agree , ments between, or combinations of, ■ corporations should be permitted, provided they are first submitted to ■ and approved by some appropriate 1 Government body. The Congress has the power to • charter corporations to engage in in -1 terstate and foreign commerce, and a ! general law can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corpor : ations could take out Federal char ters and new Federal corporations could be created. Provision should also be made for complete publicity : in all matters affecting the public and complete protection to the in vesting public and the shareholders in the matter of issuing corporate : securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable, a license act for big interstate corporations might be enacted, or a combination of the two might be tried. The supervision ! established might be analogous to ; that now exercised over national banks. At least, the anti-trust act should be supplemented by specific i prohibitions of the methods which experience has shown have been of most service in enabling monopolistic combinations to crush out competi tion. The real owners of a corpora tion should be compelled to do busi ness in their own name. To confer upon the National Gov ernment, in connection with the amendment I advocate in the anti trust law, power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in in terstate commerce would benefit them as it has benefited the national banks. In the recent business crisis it is noteworthy that the institutions which failed were institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the National Government. Those which were under National control stood the test. National control of the kind above advocated would be to the benefit of every well managed railway. From the standpoint of the public there is need for additional tracks, additional terminals, and Improvements in the actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly as possible. Am ple, safe and speedy transportation facilities are even more necessary than cheap transportation. There fore there is need for the investment of money which will provide for all these things while at the Same time securing as far as is possible better wages and shorter hours for their employes. Therefore while there must be Just and reasonable regula tion of rates we should be the first to protest against any arbitrary and un thinking movement to cut them down without the fullest and most careful consideration of all interests con cerned and of the actual needs of- the situation. Only a special body of men acting for the National Govern ment under authority conferred upon it by the Congress is competent to pass judgment on such a matter. Those who fear, from any reason, the extension of Federal activity will do well to study the history not only of the national banking act but of the pure-food law, and notably the meat inspection law recently enacted. The pure-food law was opposed so violently that its passage was de layed for a decade; yet it has worked unmixed and immediate good. The meat inspection law was even more violently assailed; and the same men who now denounce the attitude of the National Government In seeking to oversee and control the workings of interstate common carriers and busi ness concerns, then asserted that we were “discrediting and ruining a great American industry. ” Two years have not elapsed, and already it has become evident that the great benefit the law confers upon the public is accompanied by an equal benefit to the reputable packing establishments. The latter are better off under the i law thgn they were without it. The ; benefit to interstate common carriers and business concerns from the legis . lation I advocate would be equally - marked. i The President urges on Congress - the need of immediate attention to . the currency. He says: We need a greater elasticity in our : currency; provided, of course, that we i recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must ! always be the most rigid examination 4y the National authorities. Provis • ion should be made for an emergency ; currency. The emergency issue ! should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon condi ; tions carefully prescribed by the Gov . ernment. Such emergency issue must - be based on adequate securities ap proved by the Government, and must [ be issued under a heavy tax. After deploring the folly of those . who indulge in reckless speculation, l thereby exposing the whole business ■ community to panic and distress, the i President states that the income ac t count of the Nation is in a most sat . isfactory condition. The satisfactory > working of the present tariff law, he : says, has been chiefly responsible for > this excellent showing. t Nevertheless, there is an evident . and constantly growing feeling among > our people that the time is rapidly ap > proaching when our system of rev > enue legislation must be revised. ) This country is definitely com i mitted to the protective system and s any effort to uproot It could not but t cause widespread industrial disaster, r In other words, the principle of the s present tariff law could not with wis i dom be changed. The question should - be approached purely from a business - standpoint; both the time and the ■ manner of the change being such as r to arouse the minimum of agitation i and disturbance in the business 1 world, and to give the least play for

Th. sole consideration should y? to see that the sum total of changes repre sents the public good. This means • that the subject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a Presidential election, because as a matter of fact experience has con clusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediate ly after such election. * There should be no tariff on any forest product grown in this country; and, in especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp; due notice of the change being of course given to those engaged in the business so as to en able them to adjust themselves to the new conditions. The repeal of the duty on wood pulp should if possible be accompanied by an agreement with Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian pulp wood. Reference is then made to the in come tax and the inheritance tax. In my judgment, writes the Presi dent, both of thesb taxes should be part of our system of Federal taxa tion. I speak diffidently about the income tax because one scheme for an income tax was declared unconsti tutional by the Supreme Court; while in addition it is a difflcut tax to ad minister in its practical working, and great care would have to be exer cised to see that it was not evaded by the very men whom it was most de sirable to have taxed, for if so evad ed it would, of course, be worse than no tax at all; as the least desirable of all taxes is the tax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. Neverthe less, a graduated income tax of the proper type would be a desirable fea ture of Federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one may be devised which the Supreme Court will de clare constitutional. The inheritance tax, however, is both a far better method of taxation, and far more important for the purpose of having the fortunes of the country bear in proportion to their increase in size a corresponding increase and bfirden of The Government has the absolute right to decide as to the terms upon, which a man shall re ceive a bequest or devise from an other, and this point in the devolu tion of property is especially appro priate for the imposition of a tax. Laws imposing such taxes have re peatedly been placed upon the Na tional statute books and as repeated ly declared constitutional by the courts, and these laws contained the progressive principle, that is, after a certain amount is reached the be quest or gift, in life or death, Is in creasingly burdened and the rate of taxation is increased in proportion to the remoteness of the man receiv ing the bequest. These principles are recognized already in the leading civ ilized nations on the world. The tax should, if possible, be made to bear more heavily upon those residing without the country than within it. A heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune is in no way such a tax upon thrift or in dustry as a like tax would be on a small fortune. No advantage comes either to the country as a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the transmis sion in their entirety of the enormous fortunes which would be affected by such a tax. We have not the slightest sympa thy with that socialistic idea which would try to put laziness, thriftless ness and inefficiency on a par with industry, thrift and efficiency; which would strive to break up not merely private property, but what is far more important, the home, the chief prop upon which our whole civiliza tion stands. Such a theory, if ever adopted, would mean the ruin of the elftire country—a ruin which would bear heaviest upon the weakest, upon those least able to shift for them selves. But proposals for legisla tion such as this herein advocated are directly opposed to this class of socialistic theories. There should be conditions under which each man ob tains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with his fellows. Referring to th# past loud com plaints that the law could not be In voked against wealthy offenders, the Message boasts that no such com plaint is heard now. The course of the Department of Justice during the last few years has been such as to make it evident that no man stands above the law, that no corporation is so wealthy that it can not be held to account The Department of Justice has been as prompt to proceed against the wealthiest malefactor whose crime was one of greed and cunning as to proceed against the agitator who Incites to brutal violence. Both the present condition of the law and the present temper of juries render it a task of extreme difficulty to get at the real wrongdoer in any such case, especially by imprisonment. Yet it is from every standpoint far preferable to punish the prime offendei;.by imprisonment rather than to fine the corporation, with the at tendant damage to stockholders. The two great evils in the execu tion of our criminal laws to-day are sentimentality and technicality. For the latter the remedy must come from the hands of the legislatures, the courts and the lawyers. The other must depend for its cure upon the gradual growth of a sound pub lic opinion. On the subject of injunctions, Mr. Roosevelt writes: I earnestly com mend to the attention of Congress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of injunctions and to protect those .rights which from time to time it unwarrantably invades. He further says that the number of accidents to wage-workers in the me chanical, manufacturing and trans portation operation* of the day has Telegraphic Ticks. J. D. Rockefeller, Jr., addressing his Sunday-school class. In New York City, praised the pleasure of getting ■ money. “The Stolypin necktie,” a phrase used by an orator of the Constitu tional Democrats, precipitated a riot in the Russian Duma. Baron Ishii said it will be neces sary for Japan to prevent the emigra tion of laborers to America alto . gether to keep absolute faith with the United States.- "become appalling. Congress is urge 4 , to provide definite compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope of the Federal power. Work men should receive certain and definite compensation for all acci dents in Industry irrespective of neg ligence. The employer is the agent of the public and on his own respon sibility and for his own profit he serves the public. When he starts in motion agencies which create risks for others, he should take all the or dinary and extraordinary risks in volved; and the risk he thus at the moment assumes will ultimately be assumed, as it ought to be, by the general public. Only in this way can the shock of the accident be diffused, Instead of falling upon the man or woman least able to bear it, as is now the case. The community at large should chare the burdens as well as the benefits of industry. The Presi dent believes that “the general intro duction of the eight-hour day should be the goal toward which we should steadily tend, and the Government should set the example in this re , spect. ” The previous recommendation of , the President for-the compulsory in . vestigation of industrial disputes is . renewed. The President urges the enactment of laws relating to the em ployment of women and children. It is idle to hold that without good laws evils such as child labor, as the over-working of women, as the fail ure to protect employes from loss of life or limb,can be effectively reached, 1 any more thaq the evils of rebates and stock-watering can be reached without good laws. The Message devotes much space to the farming industry and boasts of the usefulness of the Department of Agriculture. No growth of cities, no growth of wealth, says Mr. Roose velt, can make up for any loss in either the number or the character of the farming population. After urging that the farmers co-operate with one another and with the Gov ernment he suggests to Congress the advisability of a national system of inspection and grading of grain en tering into interstate and foreign commerce as a remedy for the pres ent evils. Next the Message discusses the conservation of our natural resources and their proper use. Our* great river systems should be developed as National water highways; the Mis sissippi, with its tributaries, stand ing first in importance, and the Col umbia second, although there are many others of importance on the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Gulf slopes. From the great lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep waterway, with deep waterways leading from it to the East and the West. Such a waterway would prac tically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. As an incident to creating the deep waterway down the Mississippi, the Government should build along its whole lower length levees which taken together with the control of the head waters, will at once and for ever put a complete stop to all threat of floods in the immensely fertile Delta region. Irrigation should be far more extensively developed than at present. It should go hand in hand with the,reclamation of swamp land. Congress is urged to act upon the recommandations of the Public .Lands Commission designed to pre vent the passage of great areas of public lands into the hands of a few men. The Government should part with its title only to the actual ■ home-maker, not to the profit-maker • who does not care to make a home. The preservation of our forests is ad -1 vocated at great length, aud the country is congratulated on the fact that so great progress has bean made. We should acquire in the Appala chian and White Mountain regions all the forest lands that it is possible to acquire for the use of the Nation. 1 In my Judgment, says the Pres ; ldent, the Government should have ■ the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas fields in Its own posses sion and to lease the rights to de velop them under proper regulations; or else, if the Congress will not adopt 1 this method, the coal deposits should be sold under limitations, to conserve them as public utilities, the right to mine cpal being separated from the title to the soil. The regulations should permit coal lands to be ; worked in sufficient quantity by the ' several corporations. h The Message continues with a ; statement„that work on the Panama Canal is proceeding in a highly sat isfactory manner, with a recommen dation of a postal savings bank sys tem and an extension of the parcel post, especially on the rural routes, 1 in the interest of the farmer and the country storekeeper, the small town and the country district. It is de sirable that the country merchant should not be crushed out, adds the 1 President. , The duty of the National Govern ment to guard the personal and property rights of the Indians with in the borders of Oklahoma remains 1 of course unchanged. I reiterate my recommendations of last year as regards Alaska. Some , form of local self-government should i be provided. • The President recommends the fortifying of Hawaii and the deepen ing of Pearl Harbor; he asks that the rights of citizenship be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico; he i strongly urges that Congress provide funds for keeping up The Hermitage. : the home of Andrew Jackson; he recommends that a naval monument : be established in the Vicksburg Na tional Park, that legislation should ! be enacted at the present session of Congress for the Thirteenth Census, and a National Gallery of Art be es i tabllshed at Washington. The Message Aunt Salome Sellers Becomes a D. A. R. at 107. ; Bangor, Me.—Aunt Salome Seilers, ; of Deer Isle, now in her 108th year, has just been admitted to member , ship in Deborah Sampson Chapter, . D. A. R., at Campello, Mass., and through the efforts of the chapter in bringing her case to the attention of the proper officials she has been • presented by the Government with a ' gold spoon, valued at 850. Her name will be carved on one of the marble > columns of the Continental Hall, Washington, asserts that the need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if Congress provided an appropria tion for the proper and legitimate ex penses of each of the great national parties, an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough organization and machin ery, which requires a large expend!- ture of money. Then the stipulation should be made that no party receiv ing campaign funds from the Treas ury should accept more than a fixed amount from any individual subscri ber or donor, and the necessary pub -1 licity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided. 1 The time has come, in my judg | ment, to set to work seriously to make our ocean mail service corre spond more closely with our recent commercial and political develop ment. As the first step in that di rection, and the step most feasible at the present time, I recommend the extension of the ocean mail act of 1891. I believe it is the duty of a first-class Power so far as practica ble to carry its ocean mails under its own flag; that the fast ocean steam ships and their crews, required for such mail service, are valuable aux iliaries to the sea power of a- nation. Referring to the army, the Message says it has always been too small and underpaid. It has never been an ap preciable tax on the people. The cry against “militarism” is con demned. There are not enough officers and it is impossible to secure enough enlisted men. The Message recommends that we should main tain in peace a complete skeleton of an army and a full medical corps. Concerning the navy, the Message says it is not enough to build one bat tleship a year. Four new battleships are recommended, with coaling sta tions and torpedo boats a-plenty. The coast line on the Pacific demands as much attention as its interests re quire, and the battle fleet should now and then be moved to the Pacific. Then the Message continues: When the Isthmian Canal is built the transit of the battle fleet from one ocean to the other will be comparatively easy. Until it is built I earnestly hope that the battle fleet will be thus shifted between the two oceans every year or two. The marksmanship on all our i hips has improved phenomen ally during the last five years. Until within the last two or three years it was not possible to train a battle fleet in squadron maneuvers under service conditions, and it is only during these last two or three years that the train ing under these conditions has be come really effective. Another and most necessary stride in advance is now being taken. Tho battle fleet is about starting by the Straits of Magellan, to visit the Pacific coast. Sixteen battleships are going under the command of Rear-Admiral Evans, while eight armored cruisers and two other battleships will meet him at San Francisco, whither certain tor pedo destroyers are also going. No fleet of such size has qver made such a voyage, and it will be of very great, educational use to all engaged in it. The only way by which to teach offi cers and men how to handle the fleet so as to meet every possible strain and emergency in time of war is to have them practice under similar con ditions in time of peace. Moreover, the only way to find out our actual needs is to perform in time of peace whatever maneuvers might be neces sary in time of war. After war is de clared it is too late to find out the needs; that means to invite disaster. This trip td the Pacific will show what some of our needs are and will enable ,us to provide for them. The proper place for an officer to learn his duty is at sea, and the only way in which a navy can ever be made efficient is by practice at sea, under all the condi tions that would have to be met if war existed. In foreign affairs this country'* steady policy is to behave toward other nations as a self-respecting man behaves toward other men. The work of The Hague Peace Conference i commended and arbitration approved. “Cuba is at our doors.” says the Message. It is not possible to permit Cuba to sink to her former condition. The Message recommends accept ance'of the invitation of Japan to the exposition to be held at Toklo in April, J 912. A commission has been sent to Ger many and the Message recommends that the information it obtains should be used to prevent a tariff war with Germany. The Message asks that the Presi dent shall have authority to re-form the agreement with China and to cancel the Indemnity in excess of $11,655,492, necessary for the actual indemnity to the United States and its citizens. The Message recommends that this Natiop should assist in the education of the Chinese people and receive Chinese students in the universities. The Message recommends that the cordial reception of the Secretary of State by the President of Mexico should be reciprocated and no pains spared to manifest a friendly feeling toward the people of our southern neighbors. After commending the Interna tional Bureau of American Republics, the Message concludes as follows: That institution, which includes a.i the American Republics in its mem bership and brings all their repre sentatives together, is doing a really valuable work in informing the peo ple of the United States about the other Republics and in making the United States known to them. Its action is now limited by appropria tions determined when it was doing a work on a much smaller scale and rendering much less valuable service. I recommend that the contribution of this Government to the expenses of the Barer u be made commensurate with its increased work.
