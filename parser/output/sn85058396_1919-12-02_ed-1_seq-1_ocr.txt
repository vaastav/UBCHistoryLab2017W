WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 G neral recommendations on legislation to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radical ianand a readjustment of thc nation to peace-time basis were the features of President Wilson's annual message to congress delivered today. The peace treaty, the president told congress, will be dis .ujsed in a separate message later, as will the railroad question. For the second time, only, since the president established j the practice of addressing congress in person, his message was 1 read today by the clerks. Principal Recommendations, The president's principal recommendations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation system with simplification of the income and excess profits. I Readjustment of thc tariff system, if necessary, to meet changes in the world situation and make the system conform with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the world " Aid for Veteran Soldiers. Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world ar, particularly in the way of government farms as proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the nation's industries built up ay the war to keep the United States independent of foreign wpply I I An enlarged program for rural developmen I . in recognition Ji the farmers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political restlessness in our body politics." Delay of Peace Cause of Unrest. At this point the president made his most extensive ref- '-fence to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest are superficial rather than deep-seated" and that "they result j Tm. or ae connected with, the failure on the part of our gov ; ffnment to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion I radical theories from seething European centers pending I "ich delay, from heartless profiteers resulting from the m 1 v-rease of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations Jpf passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to lrmal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear." I Oppoi,f violent Methods.

So other road lies open to us. Governments must recoenfzc th right of men to bar caln collectively for humane objects. Iabor no longer must be treated as a commodity. "The right of individuals to strike Is Inviolate." continues the message, "and ought not to Im- interfered with by ny process of government but there is a pn lomlnant right and that Is the right of the Kovorninent to protect all of if people and to awsert its power and maj esty against the challenge of any class." The president was referring to th O vanunan t'a iccent injunction apa ns. thc coal strike. Rucsla a Painful Object Lesson TUj muMR' closed with a pointed fer- 1 erence to radicalism and red doctrines nnd referred to "Kussln today with its blood and terror" as a "painful object lesson of the power of minorities." "There are thOM In this country." said ' the mcsMifiV. "who threaten direct ic tion to force their will upon a majority. It mnkts little difference what a minority it la. whether capital or labor, or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country. 11 Orderly processes, thc message declared. were the only ones by which relief and 1 reform could be obtained. "Those who would propose any othr methods of reform are enemies of this country." the message said " "Let those . beware who take the shorter road to dlsordei and revolution." Tho following Is the text of Presi dent Wll?0n's message to congress: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives : I sincerely regreat that I cannot bo present at the opening of this session of the congress I am thus prevented iroro presenting in as direct a way as I could wish the many questions that f.re pressing for solution at this time. Happily, 1 h;.c had the advantage of! the advice of the heads of the several I executive departments who have kepi in close touch with affairs in their de tail and whose thoughtful reconimend a tlons I earnestly second. In (he matter of thc railroads and I the readjustment of their affairs grow ing out of federal control, I shall take the liberty at a later day of addressing you, Favorc Budget System. I hope that congress will bring to a conclusion ;.i this session legislation lookinc to the establishment of a btld gel system. That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not independently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan ol expenditure properly related to the nation s income, there can be no doubt. 1 believe the burden of prepar ing the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the work is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated instead of diwded. rest upon the execu tive. The budget so prepared should ; be submitted to and approved, or amended by a single committee of; each house of congress and no Single appropriation should be made b the congress, except, such as may have bet n in luded in the budget prepared by the executive, or added by the par tlcular committee of congress charped with the budget legislation. j Future Taxation Problems. I trust that the congress will give its Immediate consideration to the prob-j lem of future taxation. Simplification of the income and protits taxes nas become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed Indispensable service during the war Th must, howtver, i L. limifllfied, not only to sae the tax payer Inconvenience and expense but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite. With reference to the details of the revenue Law. the secretary of the i treasury and the commissioner of in-: tenia revenue will lay before you fori your consideration certain amend-' ments necessary, or desirable, in con nection with the administration oi the; law recommendations wbic hhavo my! approval and support. It is of the ut-1 most importance thai in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes, for the calendar ear 1920 payable in' the calendar year 1921 The congress uiulit well consider whether the Meti er rate of income and ; profits' taxes can in peace limes be effectively pro ductive of revenue and whether they may not. on the contrary, be destruc tive of business activity and produc-, tive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace times1 high rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the incen tive to new enterprise, encourage ex I travaganl expenditures and produce in dustrial stagnation with consequent! unemployment and other attendant evils. Problem Is Difficult. The problem is not an easy one. A' fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of Amer ica in the world's affairs. The preju dice and passions engendered by de cades of controversy between two schools of political thought the one believers in protection of American In-1 d US tries, the other believers in tariff i for revenue only must be subordinat ed to the single consideration of tho i public Interest in the light of u'terlj , (Continued on Tnco 7.")
