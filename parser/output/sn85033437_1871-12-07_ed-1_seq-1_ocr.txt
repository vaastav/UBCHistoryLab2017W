Newspapers, by enhanc ing the value of the the property in the neighborly, and giving the localities in which they sue published a reputation abroad, benehtall such, particularly if they aic merchants or real estate owners, thrice the amount weekly of the meagre sum they pay for their support Beside, every public spirited citizen has a laudable pride m having a paper of which he is not shamed, even though he thould pick it UP in New York and Washington. A ood looking, thriving sheet helps prop erty, gives a character to locality, and " in many respects a public convenience. f fcom any cause the matter In the local columns should not be up to the stand ard, do not cast it aside and pronounce it pod-for-nothing, until satisfied there has Jen no more labor bestowed upon it inan is paid for.

" Correspondence Knoxvil'e Chronicle. Washington. D. C. Dec. 2. The city is rapidly filling up with Sena tors, members of the House and the usual throng of attendant visitors and lobbyists 1 he latter compose a numerous class, but are not as respectable and mllucntial as many suppose. It is a very common thing for newspaper writers to magnify the ex tern; or corruption In Washington in and aoout congress ana the Departments. There are many correspondents who make this subject their stock in trade. They would have little else to write about, for as a class tne men who constantlv write on that subject have not brains enough to find otner material of which to make interest ing letters. YY hen I say this, I do not want to be understood either as saying that there is no corruption here, or that newspaper correspondents do not often have just foundation for their complaints On the contrary, every shrewd observing visitor in ashington will see some dis honesty and sellishness on the part of public men,, and realize also, that the newspaper -correspondents at Wash ington, as a class, are an able, fearless aud valuable corps of gentlemen; who reuder the public a great service in closely watching and exposing all jobs and the nianv selfish and dishonorable motives that govern some , men in the public service. But unfortunately there belongs to this corps a few who are chronic grumblers and men of narrow views and extreme prejudices. They see many tin worthy and incompetent men in office They see mean motives and corrupt inllu ences governing them in their acts. They straightway suspect every one, and where there is the least ground for suspicion, jump at the worst conclusions. They are encouraged to do this, for their letters ana dispatches burdened with' these tales of malfeasance in office, and with many sus picious and irrave charces. are eacrerlv read by thousands of persons who are al ways ready to believe everything of their kind that is bad. buch readers call cor respondents of this kind "spicy" and "in corruptible." 'lhe Democratic papers very Maturely give undue prominence to such "honest truths" (as they call, them) and tickle the writers and their papers by com mending them as "independent," &c. Such influences act very freely upon some men. and always serve to keep hard at work some dyspeptic soreheads.who write many unjust and unfounded stories about public men in Washington and elsewhere. But, as I said before, there is some corrup tion here as. there is in every place where public monies are dispensed, and there always has been and always will be; It is very natural that dishonest men flock where the plunder is to be found. THE OTHER SIDE OK THE FICTUKE. But there is another side of the picture encouraging to every man that suspects in tegrity and ability in public servants. There are men in high position here and I am clad to believe them largely in the ma jority who maintain their integrity against " a i.i! nM i. every lempiaiiou. x uk-u iciupuiwuns are great. Men of moderate means come to Washington with their families. They find A J 1 i 1 many unexpecteu aemauus upon ineir (urse. i neir wives auu uaugiuers imug ing in the social circle want fine dresses and costly jewels, They are invited to en tertainments, and, or course, w,ant to re ciprocate. In these and other ways their salaries soon melt away. The conflict be tween ambition and pride and their sense of duty begins. Temptations are placed before them by cunning nvais or personal . i ;ii i enemies or oeterniinea men wun ueavy iobs and glgantw swindling enterprises. Thev see where they might mate a. thou sand or ten thousand and not be discover ed. Some yield, but many resist and fight manfully through, spurning dishonorable advances and exposing dangerous com binations. There are many men mpubhe life tn..!nir on tViorolifirp Vxipnhprptoforp. wliose I.VJ Ulj . eo v - I struggles in this respect present sublime pictures of WtfraJ hefoism. I could name able and incorruptifcte ran who have stood up like heroes and fought eprtuptiMn in every form for years, and all through their public life had nothing but their salary ta support them and their families. They are, lani glad to say, the men of in fluence and character Lercjt.Q-day and their word is worth more to defeat corruptions than powerful lobbies are to press them through, f The example an4 inuuence of one such man is worth more to promote integrity and fidelity in the service of the govern ment than the example of those whose dishonorable acts are being exposed aud punished every day. It seems to me that the public want to know something of this side of the picture, and they would hear and see more of it, if, by their actions, they gave these grumblers to understand that their constant prating about corrup tion was rather suspicion a d certainly not acceptable, unless based upon reliable information or reasonable proof. I might mention some correspondents here who have attained considerable reputation. I ought, perhaps, to say notoriety, because of their constant lamentations on the de moralization of tJ;fi public service, who were, at the very time, afeticg as the hired tools of lobbyists. These tools, accusing public men here of all sorts of personal vice?, were themselves victims of the very same abuses, and, in fact, otten based their suspicions upon their own experiences. It is very easy to find fault and criticize, and some very naturally run into that rut. They see the weak points of public men, but sbut their eyes to the strong points. They see corruption, buf turn away from shining examples of integrity. They look after subservient, weak men, but pass bv tvvirips independent ones. They gee reasons for suspecting wrong, but they do nnt wnit, in pive their victim tne Denem of the doubt. Thev seem never t5 think i ney secnr ne easier to destroy reputations them up ; that it is pleasant- that it is far than to build er to throw etonpa than to be struck with them, - --, - f, i v"v But it is useless t to follow the subj ect farther. The whole matter can be summed up by saying that if half the stories and suspicious of corruption in Washington were true, we would not long have a Gov ernment. If laws were enacted without regard for ther Constitution, or if they were executed without reference ! to. the public service; if legislators in providing for the public expenditures or administra tion officers in disbursing the public mon ies were influenced as -much by corrupt agencies as some men charge, and as many profess to believe, wo would Ik? so steeped HI Corruption nild KO vpnlrPTTPl hv ilis- in rwi..n. - J i i ! atlection that the whole fabric of Govern nient would fall to pieces, r ' HIE 

FHESENT ADMINISTRATION IS AN EXAMPLE. It is just now fashionable to sneer at the present Administration as corrupt and without any head. As far as corruption is concerned, I have perhaps answered it above, but may add that that though the amount , of patronage, and consequently uie inuueements to dishonesty are yearly increasing, there is a more determined war being waged to day against1 corruption,; uhu m iaci mere is comparatively less dis honesty in AVashington to-day than for many administrations. " As to the charge that there is no head to the present Administration, it may best be answered by saying that a criticism, very onen maue Dy us inenos, is that there is too much of it. Montgomery Blair, in his A A ? a i -a recem interview, saui ijranr, naa never read a book, had but little general infor mation; and knew nothing of his duties. And yet, as a fact, Uen. Grant has written more of his own State papers, which com pare favorably with others, and taken less advice as to the policy of his administra tion, than any President we have had for years. I was assured of this fact bv a gen tleman in high position here, who has had, to a remarkable extent, the conhdence of several preceding Administrations. 'He told me that, but a few days ago, he visited the President in his private room and saw his forthcoming message just being com pleted, every word of it written by the President himself, "and," he added'there was not a man, then living, who knew its contents." The San Domingo message accompanying the Commissioners' report, which was most favorably received every where, was every line of it the President's work, and without any consultation. It is very customary for such State docu ments to be written by Cabinet officers, a ad very uncommon for them to be prepared without full consultation with the Cabinet and other confidential ad vi vers. It ought to be so, and. therefore, I say the criticism that the Administration had too much head " is not. uncommon. . I mention these facts to 6how howfalso is the general charge, that the President knows nothing about his duties, and never wrote (and, as a fact, could not write) his State papers. A. J. It. , The Trcsidcut's Message. . We give the following extracts from the President's Message, as we find it iu our exchanges : OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. The relations of the United State with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an eventful one, in wit nessing two great nations, speaKing one language and having one lineage, settling, by peaceful arbitrations, disputes of long standing, and liable, at any time, to bring inose nations inio oioouy connicts. ivn example has thus been set which, if suc cessful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and be the final means of returning to productive industry millions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the bayonet and broadsword. 1 transmit nerewitna copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been concluded since the adjournment , of Con erress. with her Britannic Majesty, and a conv of the protocol of the conferences of tne jonimissioiiers uy wnuiu it was iiugu- 7. 'V. , ' i i :t tiated. This treaty provides methods tor g thp mjestiona pending between nations; fThe various 'questions are to be adjusted by arbitrations. THE NATIONAL DEBT has been reduced to the extent of eighty six millions fifty-seven thousand one hun dred and twenty-six dollars aud eighty cents during the year, and by the negotia- tion of national conas at a lower raie oi . l , xw t i i x e interest, the iuterest on' the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly seventeen million dollars less than on the first of -March, 1S69. Itwas highly desirable that this rapid dimunition should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country, and convince its citizens of their ehtytie ifoWl P mPP Yen dllar of liability without bankrupting them. But in view of the accomplishment of these desirable ends and of the rapid de velopment of the resources of the country, its increasing, ability to meet ..large de mands and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this - rapid payment. T therefore recommend a modification of both . ' TAUlFJf" AND 

IHTSRNAL TAX LAWJa. . I would recommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobacco in its various forms from stamps. In readjusting tne inrm l suggest; that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected under the pjeient . laws, ntter providing ior tne current expenses of tue government, tne interest account and a sinking fund, and that this as a surplus be reduced in such manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are. many articles not produced at home, such as medicines and compounded essences, from hfch ypry little revenue is derived, but which enter into general u&e, .u such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made on those articles which it rn without disturbing home production or reducing'.the v&ges cf American labor.
