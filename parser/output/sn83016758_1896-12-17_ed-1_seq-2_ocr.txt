"Havana, Dec. ttDear Friend Justo: Our brave general, Antonio Maceo, and the greater part of his staff has been murdered by the Spaniard*, the Spanish major, Cirujeda, acting the part of assassin, with Dr. Maximo Zertucha as an assistant in the hor jrible drama. Convinced that, notwith standing his enormous army, be could do nothing against our gallant leader, who had so repeatedly defeated the Spanish generals in Pinar del Rio, Weyler conceived the idea of appeas ing his beastly instincts by cold blood ed murder and making the best of the secret relations between Dr. Zertucha and the marquis of Ahumada. he planned with the latter Lis hellish scheme. Weyler took the field and in his absence .Ahumada proprsed through Zertucha a conference with vMaceo to take place at a certain point in the Province of Havana, with the view of arranging plans for the ces sation of hostilities "The conditions acd place of meet ing having been agreed upon, Maceo crossed +he trocha over the ro"d to Guanajay withont being molested by the forts, but as s'oon as he arrived at the plaee decided upon he and his party were greeted by a tremendous volley from the troops under Maj. Cirujeda, who lay conveniently in am bush. Most of the officers on his staff fell with Gen. Maceo. Zertucha is alive, because he was aware of the scheme and remained in the rear. The Spaniards know vhere the bodies are, but are bent on feigning ignorance fto blot our the vestiges of the crime." 9Iaceo Safd to Be Alive. Jacksonville, Fla., Dec. 14,A special from Key West sajs: Passengers by the Olivette to-day announce that Maceo is still alive. Dr. Zertucha went with Maceo as far as the trocha and saw the party through safely. They were accompanied by a mulatto WPO resembles Maco, and who was killed in the engagement after passing the trocha. Then Maceo and his few followers returned to Pinar del Rio province and went into a cabin, when the doctor reported to the Spaniards. The latter succeeded in killing most of Maceo's party, but Gen. Maceo brained the first man to attack him and escaped to the woods, leaving his clothing and effects at the cabin. Great excitement exist here over news., ^C'r"fMopc"sPilibuters.the Tampa, Fla, Dec. 15.Sixty-seven men left here this morning on the reg ular Florida Central & Peninsular train in two private coaches for a point near Jacksonville, where they will embark to-night for Cuba. They form one of three combined expeditions now en route to Cuba. Gen. Carlos Roloff has sailed from some Northern port in the Bermuda. It is sale* that he is* to be met by two expeditions as he comes South. Rumor has/ it that one is to be made up from the Atlanta Cuban colony and to go to the nearest* .port where they will embark. The second party left here this morning i and five Americans were among the number. It is thought that they will go to Trout creek, arrive there after dark and embark 'at once the Three Friends. The Cubans here state that they will be sn the ocean at mid night. At daylight this morning small sgjjajls of Cubans, all carrying'bundles. wereseen making their way toward the Florida Central. Those of the party who came from Tampa took back streets to the depot. According to the best information obtfinable this is to be the largest comlivp&tion ever at tended by the Cubans. Sympathy For Cubans. Washington. Dec. 15. The head quarters of the Cuban legation in this city was the center of interest to a number of callers to-day who had'eome to express to Senor Quesada their sor row at the death of Gen. Maceo and to offer their sympathy and, in some cases, help for the Cuban CMuse. These callers included a number of congress men and two senators (whose names the Cuban representatives declined to* disclose), who told him of their desire to see some action by congress tha would be of assistance to the insur gents. Senor Quesada says that he has received during the past few days about fifty letters, many from persons and organizations offering to send men to assist the Cubans in fighting for liberty. ff I'Mg^. %gp& Texan.

After that, the meeting formed a permanent organization for the pur pose of helping Cuba in every neces sary way to throw off the yoke of its oppressor. Still Another Story. Havana, Dec. 15.Further inquiries by the correspondent of the Associated Press have elicit.-d the following addi tional details, which are positively re 4iafcte, of the, manner in which Antonio Maceo met his death. It is known that Maceo expected the insurgent brigadier general. Sanchez, to corcentrate his forces in Havana province in readi ness for Maceo when he should pass he trocha. It,happened, however, that in passing the Spanish column com manded by Maj. Cirujeda Maceo mis took the force of guerrillas under Peral for Sanchez's vanguard, and found himself among them- before he dis covered his mistake. At the first vol ley from. the^Spanish Maceo fell, t\ 4-tf&. 3 wounded. The insurgents, takeriVi!by eurprisercommenced a gcneral'tire as they retreated, and abandoned Maceo in a dying condition. More Arm* for Cubans. Jacksonville, Fla., Dec 15. Every Indication points to the departure to morrow morning of another Cuban ex pedition. The steamer Commodore has received permission to leave port and is lying at one of the railway wharves preparatory to taking on a cargo early in the morning. After loading the arms the owners of the steamer will demand clearance papers for a Cuban port on authority of the decision of Attorney Geneial Harmon, and custom house ofiicials are expected to grant clearance. If the steamer shall then be seized by a revenue cutter the own ers will turn the vessel over to the government and then institute suit to recover the value of the vessel and cargo. The Three Friends and the Dauntless are expected to follow the example of the Commode re. Kick to the Powers. Madrid, Dec. 15.A meeting of the cabinet council has been called for this week, this being the first meeting of the cabinet since President Cleveland's message was transmitted to congress, on account of the illness of Senor Canovas, the premier. According to some of the Spanish newspapers, the question will be raised at this council of the expediency Qf a confidential note to the ambassadors of the powers here in Madrid regard to President Cleveland's message. The cabinet min isters, however, ui&intain an absolute reserve on this subject, and, therefore, any newspaper statements on the sub ject are premature. Havana, Dec. 13.Capt Gen Weyler arrived once more in this city to-day on horseback, accompanied bf mem bers of his staff and a cavalry escort. The streets of Havana were thronged with people and the houses of the town had been gaily decorated. The Marques Ahumada, vice governor gen eral, accompanied by the cojonel of his staff, met Capt. Gen. Weyler at the entrance of the palace. Gen. Weyler soon appeared on the palace balcony, bowing his acknowledgments to the vivas which the multitude in the square were shouting for Spain, Span ish Cuba, the king, the queen, the army, the navy and the volunteers. Capt. Gen Weyler made a brief ad dress in the course of which he said: "I have only directed. The army has done all" various civil and military delegations were received later^by Gen. Weyler at the palace. Marques Ahum ada also offered his congratulations upon the death of Maceo. The Doctor's Story. Havana, Dec. 13.Dr. Zortucha, the personal physician of Antonio Maceo, who, after surrendering to Col. Tort at San Felipe, furnished confirmation of the reported death of the great Cuban leader, has given to the press in an interview at Matena del Sur, addition al facts in connection with the case. It seems that Antonio Maceo and his companions did not cross the trocha or military line of Pinar del Rio in the sense generally understood They passed from Pinar del Rio into Ha vana province by sea, in" an open boat, five trips being required to take the whole party of insurgents from Pinar del -Rio to Oarbtnez, this province, and as the boat would only hold eight men in addition to the handlers, it will be seen" that" Maceo's pavty was com posed of only forty men. The night was dark and stormy. Mce was ac companied by Mivo, nether Important insurgent leader, and othois of his staff. They landed near Banes, and shortly afterward occurred the en counter with the Spanish troops under Maj. Cirujeda, resulting as alleged, in the death of the Cuban chief. The meeting between the Spaniards and the insurgents was seemingly of an accidental nature, the former hav ing no idea at that time that Maceo had succeeded in leaving the Province of Pinar del Rio. In spite of the, of ficial accounts of the death of Maceo and Francisco Gcmez there are many here who refuse to credit the report. Friends of the insurgents express" the belief that either the jewelry and oth er things alleged to have been found by the Spanish soldiers did not belong to Maceo or else that they were placed upon the body as a ruse, in order to throw dust in the eyes of the Span iards while Maceo pushed on east ward and communicated witb Maximo Gcmez. 4 Still Discredited Key West, Fla., Dec. 13.Maceo's death is still discredited by the great er number of prominent Cubans here. Yet there are a number who fear it is true. All await the arrival of the steamship from Haan to-morrow, however, before conceding it to be true. The Spanish consul received ontcial news of Maceo's death yesterday. The report that Dr. Zertucha, who was Maceo's physician, had seen Maceo's body exhumed, is untrue. It is learned from a reliable source that the doctor never was Maceo's physician. Some gentlemen here b&lieve that Maceo had formed a plan with Gomez to go to the Havana district to meet Gomez's forces there, as Gomez had sent 7,000 men to the Havana district. Maceo crossed the trocha with 600 men. In a skirmish with the forces of Gen. Arolas after he had crossed the trocha Maceo's forces wounded twelve of the Spanish troops. It is reported that Maceo left Rios Rivera, his second in command, who landed from the Unit ecj States Sept. 1,' in charge of the in surgent forces in Pinar del Rio Rios Rivera defeated the Spanish in the last war in the presence of Jovellar. If the report of Maceo's death be true, then Cubans will cry "viva Rios Ri- vera." The United States warship Newark arrived here this morning. Nothing can be learned of her errand.^ Dauntless Seised. f%& Jacksonville, Fla., Dec. 13. The steamer Dauntless, that has achieved such a reputation as a filibuster, was seized by the government last night on complaint of the Spanish consul that she was contemplating another expedition. Her papers were taken away and an officer from the Boutwell put on board. To-day, on demand of Owner Bisbee's lawyer, her papers were returned, but he was informed that she could'jttot leave the harbor until he had made affidavit that she was not going on any expedition save with a revenue officer on board Bis bee intimates that the revenue officer here will be sued, as also the captain of tbe.BQutwfiil for seizure* Washmgfon/Dee. 16.The reported assassination of, Maceo has rekindled in Interest in the cuban question in thjIL house, although it is hardly likely tba the interest will be productive of any4 legislative action.

Key West, Fla Dec. 16.Firing has-, f^| been heard all day long west of Ha vana. Not steady, but desultory, as if running fight were being had. Sev- %S eral companies of Spanish troops were sent out during the day in that direc tion, but no tidings have yet been re ceived of the results. On account of articles to the American press displeas ing to Gen. Weyler, the censors' rules have become more rigid and arbitrary,, and American correspondents have trouble in getting at news matters on the island. Energetic* endeavors are being made to hunt out the correspond ents of the New York junta in Ha vana. Weyler threatens to dispose of them summarily if caught. Over ?5,- 000 will be raised here and at Tampa this week for the New York junta.^j iti**- 4& 1 inon a and Forwar at, A
