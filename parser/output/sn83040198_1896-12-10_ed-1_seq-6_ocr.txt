NATIONAL AFFAIES. Xresident Cleveland Transmits His Message to Congress. .Relation with Foreign Countries Clearly Defined The Cuban Situation Radical Currency Reforms Urged Trusts and Monopolies Discussed. Washington, Dec 7. The Fifty Fourth congress assembled for the short session at noon tc-day and soon after committees from the house " and senate waited on the president and in formed him that they were ready to receive any communication he mi-.'ht have to make aDd the president then sent the following" communication: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives cf the people in the legis lative branch of their government you have as sembled at a time when the strength and ex cellence of our free institutions and the fitness of cur citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest in volving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension and creating ag gressiveness so intense ns to approach bitter ness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage, without disturbance of our tranquility or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a h-jated clash of . political opinions we discover abundant evidence of a determi nation on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of theirgnvernment. Thus our peo ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en titles them to demand of those who undertake to ma';e and execute their laws such faithful and unsellish service in their behalf as can only be prouipte 1 by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of pv-blic duty invites. In obedience to a con stitutional requirement. I herein submit to the congress certain information concerning na tional affairs, with.the suggestion of such leg islation as in my judgment is necessary and expedient. To so -urc brevity and avoid tire some narration. I sh-ill omit many details con cerning mutters within federal control which, though by no means unimportant, are more proS j a ly discussed in departmental reports. I shall also curtail this communication by omitting minute recital of many minor inci dents connected with our foreign relations which have hltcerto found a place in executive messages, but are now contained In a report of the secretary of state, which is herewith sub mitted. The Armenian Question. At the outset of a reference to more impor tant matters affecting our relations with foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction if I could assure the congress that the disturbed condition or Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assume I a less hideous and bloody aspect and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demands of human civilization, or as the re sult of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to interfere for the protection cf those exposed to the rage of mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking fea ures of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softening disposition or protective interven tion, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruc tion of homes and th3 bloody butchery of men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often In the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future is by no means assured. Our gov ernment at home and our minister at Constan tinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries in Ottoman territory, who consti tute nearly all the individuals residing there who have -a right to claim our protection on the score of American citizenship. Several naval vessels are stationed in the Med iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur nlh all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have made claims against the Turl:ish government for the pillage and de truotion of missionary property at Harpool jxnd Marash during uprisings at those places. The Insurrection in Cuba. The iasurrjetion In Cuba still continues with--all its perplexities, it is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made to wards the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last an nual message has In the least improved. If ;Spaia still holds Havana and the seaports and all considerable towns, the Insurgents still Toatn at will over at least two-t'airds of the in land country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the 1 ipse of time and is evidenced by her unhesitating devotion of largely increised military and naval forces to th task, there is much rea son to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers, and character, and resnurce-i. and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb, without practi cally securing the great project for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the insur gents yet made good their, title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the con test has gon on, the pretense that civil gov ernment exists on the island, except so far as Spain is abl ; to maintain it. has been practi cally abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less imperfectly, in the large towns and their immediate suburbs. But. that exception being made, the entire country is eitaer given over to an archy or is subject to the mili tary occupation of one or the other party. It is reported, iadeed. on reliable au-tt'Oi-lty that, at the dcr.au a of the commander-in-chief of the insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all at tempt m exorcise its functions, leaving that government conresseHy (wh3t there is the best reason for supposing it always to have been In fact) a government merely on paper. "Were the Spanish armies ab!e to meet their antagonists in the open, or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for and tie immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and equipment, could hardly tail to tell greatiy to their advantage. Hut they are called upon to face a foe that chuDK -general engagements, that can choose and does cl.oo.se its own ground, that from the nature of the country is visible or Invisible at pleasure and that Cthts only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on its side. In a country where all that is indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtain able especially by these born and bred on the soli it is obvic'js that there is hardly a limit to ' the time during which hostilities of this sort - may . be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the pas sions of the combatants grow more and more infi unel and excesses on both sides become" more frequent and more deDlorable. They also are participated in by bands of marauders, who now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other as may best suit the occasion, harry the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruction of property even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable. But while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish government, it has now apparent ly abandoned it. and is acting upon the same theory as the Insurgents, namely, that the ex igencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property, that it may not prove of use and advantage to the enemy. It is to the same end that in pursuance of gen eral orders, Spanish garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural pop ulation required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the Industrial value of the island is fast di minishing and unless there is a speedy and radical change in existing conditions, it will soon disappear altogether. That value con sists very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugars, a capacity already much re duced by the interruption to tillage, which have taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should these in terruptions continue during the currant year, and practically extend, as it is now threat ened, to the entire sugar producing territory of the island, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremly doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe would engage the serious attention of the gov ernment and people of the United States under any circumstances. In point o fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of - a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from 130.000,003 to "0,0 0,000 of American cap ital are invested in plantations and in railroad, mining and other business enterprises on the Island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in 1SS9 amount ed to about 3S4.O00.O00, rose in 1893 to about 103,0-0.000. and in 1891. the year before the in surrection broke out. amounted to nearly i95, 0, 0. Besides this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself inextricably involved in the present con test in other ways, tooth vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and d irectly promote the insurrection through the press by public meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds and by other means which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and in all their feelings in interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this government and not unnatu rally regarded with much indignation by the country of their origin. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property interests affected and considerations of philanthropy and hu manity in general have led to a vehement de mand in various quarters for some sort of pos itive Intervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belliger ent rights should be accorded to the insur gentsa proposition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation clearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the Independence of the insurgents should be recognized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be. no other exists there, unless the will of the military officer in temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now suggested that the United States should buy the island, a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to en tertain such a proposal. It is urged, finally, that all other methods failing, the existing in ternecine strife in Cuba should be terminated by our intervention, even at the cost of war between the United States and Spain, a war which its advocates confidently prophecy could be neither large in its proportions nor doubtful in Its issue. The correctness of this forecast need be either affirmed nor denied- The United States has nevertheless the character to main tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and might should be the rule of its con duct. It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home rule which.while preserving the sovereignty of Spain would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, there should be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effected on that bais. It was in timated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago that if a satisfac tory measure of home rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents and would be ac cepted by them upon a guaranty cf its execution the United States would en deavor to find a way not objection able to Soain of furnishing such guaranty. It should be added that it cannot be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely main tained. While we are anxious to a- cord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all its features, and properly apprehend our inevita ble relations to it and its possible results with out considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone - and in her own way. or with our friendly co-operation. When the inability of Spain to deal success fully with the inurrection has become mani fest, and it is demonstrated that her sover eignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug gle for its re-establishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothinsr more than the useless sacrifice of human life and then utter destruction of the very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. The Venezuelan Boundary Question. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States, their re spective governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela, submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The provi sions of the treaty are so eminently just and fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated. Government Revenues and Expenses. The secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to 409,475.4 & 78. During the same period its expenditures were S434.6S7.6-4.43. The excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounted to ti5,203.23.70. The ordinary ex penditures during the year were $4,015,852.21 less than during the preceding fiscal year. Of the receipts mentioned there were derived from customs the sum of S 160,021,751.67, and from internal revenue, fl4t5.830.615.66. The re ceipts from customs show an increase of 7, 863,13123 over those from the same source for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1893, and the re ceipts from internal revenue an increase of 3.-84.537.81. . The value of our imported dutiable merchan dise duming the last fiscal year was 369,757,470 and the value of free goods imported 4"9,967, 470, being an increase of 6.533,67 in the value of dutiable goods and 91,331.034 in the value of free goods over the preceding year. Our ex ports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, amounted in value to 382,8 J6.928, being an in crease over the preceding year of 7 ,038.773. The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable goods imported during the year was 39.94 per cent, and on free and dutiable goods taken to gether 20.55 per cent. The total amount of gold exported was HU, 409.947 and of silver $60,541.670,being an increase of 45,941,446 of gold and 13,210,384 of sliver over the exportation of the preceding fiscal year. The Imports of gold were i3i.533.oa and of silver SJ8.777.186. being 3.8 9.C95 less of gold and 8.f 63.U07 more of silver than during the preceding rear. The total stock of metallic money in the United States at the close of the last fiscal year ending on the 30th day of June, 1896, was 1,228,326.035. of which $99,597,934 was of gold and i6C8,738,071 of silTer. On the 1st day of November. 1893, the total stock of money of all kinds in the country was 2.285,41090 and the amount in circulation, not including that in the treasury holdings, was tl.W.O 5,64l, being $2 J. 6a per capita upon an estimated population of 71,932,00a The production of the precious metals in the United States during the calendar year 1895 Is estimated to have been 2.254,700 fine ounces of gold of the value of 46.610,000. and 55,727,000 fine ounces of silver, of the commercial value of $-'6,445,000 and the coinage value of 7,- 051.000. The total coinage at the mints of the United States during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1805. amounted to S71, 188.468.52, of which 58, 878,49 J was in gold coin and $16,809,978.52 in standard silver dollars and minor coins. The number of national banks organized from the time the law authorizing their creation was passed up to October 31, 1896. was 5,051, and of this number 3.679 were at the date last men tioned in active operation, having au thorized capital stock of 650,014,893, held by 28S.903 shareholders, and cir culating notes amounting to 21 1,413,62a The total outstanding circulating notes of all national banks on the 3lst of October, 1S93 amounted to S234.?-53,8t7, including unredeemed, but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and in process of liquidation. The Increase in na tional bank circulation during the year ended on that day was 21,009,430. On October, 189-., when the condition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of the 3,( 73 active institutions was 3,2C3.68.313.83, which in cluded tl .893,2(58,819. 31 in loans and discounts and S36!,16733.85 in money of all kinds oa hand Of their liabilities 81,587.891,058 was due to individual depositors and 209.944,019 con sisted of outstanding circulating notes. The War Department. The report of the secretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions in the several branches of the public service Intrusted to his charge. The limit of our artillery force as fixed by law is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morals of the army are excellent and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout its entire organiza tion. With the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary in which the Mexican troops co-operated and the compul sory, but peaceful return with the consent of Great Britain of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active operation have been required of the army dur ing the past year. The organized militia numbers 1 12.879 men. The appropriations for its support by the sev -eral states approximate $.1,800,0 K) annually and 400.000 is contributed by the general govern ment Investigation shows these troops to be unusually well drilled and inspired with much military Interest, and in many instances they ore so deficient in proper arms and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately prepared for field service. I therefore recommend that prompt measures be taken to remedy this condition and that every encouragement be given to this deserv ing body of unpaid and voluntary citizen sol diers upon whose assistance we must largely rely in time of trouble. During the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion of the scheme adopied for the erection and armament of for tifications along our sea coast, while equal progress has been made in providing the mate rial for submarine defense in connection with these works. This improved situation is largely due to the recent generous response of congress to the recommendations of the war department. The Attorney-iieneral's Department. The attorney-general presents a detailed and interesting statement of the important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal year. The ownership and management by the government of penitentiaries for the confinement of the convicted in the United States courts of violations of federal laws, which for many years has been a subject of executive recommendation, has at last to a slight extent been realized by the utiliza tion of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary. This is certainly a movement in the right di rection: but it oug-it to be at once supple mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge ment of this improvised prison and the con struction of at least one more, to be located in the southern states. The capacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary is- so limited that the expense of its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners it can accommodate does not make as econom ical an exhibit as it would if it were larger and better adapted to prison purposes: but I am thoroughly con vinced that economy, humanity and a proper sense of responsibility and duty toward those whom we punish for violation of federal law dictate that the federal government have the entire control and management of the peniten tiaries where convicted violators are confined. It appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth military prison to its new uses tha work previously done by the prisoners con fined there, and for which expensive machin- J ery has been provided, has been discontinued. This work consisted of the manufacture of articles for army use. now done elsewhere. Oa all grounds it is exceedingly desirable that the convicts confined -in this penitentiary be al lowed to resume work of this description. The Post Office Department. Our post office department is in good condi tion and the exhibit made of its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, ii allowance is made for imperfections in the laws applicable to it. is very satisfactory. The total receipts during the year were 5S2.499.208. 4a The total expenditures were S0. 626,296. 84. ex clusive of 1.559.898.27, which was-eamed by the Pacific railroad for transportation and credit on their debt to the government. There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of 5,5i6,f-.21. or 7.1 per cent, and an increase of expenditures of $3,833,124.0:, or 4.43 per cent. The deficit was 1,679.9:6.19 less than that oi the preceding year. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law and are not in control, of the postmaster-generaL All that he can accomplish by the most watch ful administration and economy is to enforce prompt and thorough collection and account ing for public moneys and such minor savings in small expenditures and in letting those con tracts for post office supplies and star service which are not regulated by statute. The average revenue from each pound ol first-class matter was 93 cents. From each pound of second-class. 8J4 mills (of the second class 52.348.C97 was county free matter). From each pound of third-class. 13.1 cents. From each pound of fourth-class. 1.6 cents. The growth in weight of second-class matter-has been from 299,0 J0.0J0 pounds in 1894 to 312.000,- 000 In 1S93. and to almost 349,030,000 In 1896, and It is quite evident this in creasing drawback is far outstripping, any possible growth of postal revenues. Our mail service should, of course, be such as to meet the wants and even the conven iences of the people, at a direct charge upon them so light as perhaps to exclude the idea of our post office department being a money making concern, but in the face of constantly recurring deficiencies in its revenue, and in view of the fact that wo supply the best mail serv ice in the world, it seems to me it is quite time to correct the abuses that swell enor mously our annual deficit If we concede the public policy of carrying weekly newspapers free - in the county of publication and even the policy of carrying at less than ene-tetnh of their cost other bona fide newspapers and periodicals, there can be no excuse for subjecting the serv ice to the further immense and increasing loss Inyotve'l ia carrying t the norr.itxl rate o! one cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes including trashy and even harmful literature and other matter, which under the loose inter pretation of a loose statute has been gradually given second-class rates, thus absorbing all profitable returns derived ' from first-class matter, which pays three or four times more than its cost, and producing a large annual loss to be paid by general taxation. Experience and observation have demon strated that certain improvements in the or ganization of the post office department must be served before wo can gain the full benefit of the immense sums expended in its administra tion. This involves t he following reforms, which I earnestly recommend: There should be a small addition to .the existing inspector service, to be employed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now numbers 13.r00 men and performs its service practically without the surveillance exercised over all other branches of the postal or public service. There should also be appointed a few Inspect ors who would assist the central office in nec essary investigation concerning matters of post office leases, post office sites, allowance for rent, fuel and lights, and in organizing and securing the best results from the work of the 14.10 J clerks now employed in first and second class offices. The Navy Department. The work of the navy department and Its present conditions are fully exhibited in the report of the secretary. The construction of vessels for our navy has been energetically prosecuted by the present administration upon the general lines previously adopted, the de partment having seen no necessity for radical changes in prior methods under which the work was found to be progressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has been decided, however, to provide in every ship building con tract that the builder should pay all trial ex penses, and it has also been determined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. On March 4, 1893. there were in commission but two armored vessels, the double-turreted monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since that date, of vessels theretofore authorized, there have been placed in their first commis sion three first-class and two second-class bat tleships, two armored cruisers, one harbor de fense ram and five doubla-turreted monitors. Including Maine and Puritan, just complete 1. Eight new unarmored cruisers and two new gunboats have also been commissioned. The Iowa, another battleship, will be completed about March 1. and at least four more gunboats will be ioady for sea in the early spring. The Interior Department. The report of the secretary of the interior presents a comprehensive and interesting ex hibit of the numerous and important affairs committed to his supervision It is impossible in this communication to do more than briefly refer to a few of the subjects concerning which the secretary gives full and instructive infor mation Our public lands, originally amount ing to 1.8 40. 000,0 JO acres have been so reduced that only about 600.'C0,0OJ acres still remain in government control, excluding Alasua- The balance, being by far the most valuable por tion, has been given away to suttlers. to new state i and to railroads, or sold at a compara tively nominal sum. - The total Indian population of the United States is 177,235. according) to a census made in S9 exclusive of those within the state of New York and those comprising the five civilized tribes. Of this number there are approxi mately 38,000 children of school age. During the year 23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended re sent efforts to extend Indian school facilities and the anticipatlan of conti nned liberal ap propriations to that end. cannot fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education of In dian children is a prime factor in thj Accomplishment of Indian civilization. Hie condition of affairs among the five civilized tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in the Indian territory and who have governments of their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire change in the relations of these Indians to the general government This seems to be necessary in furtherance of their own interests as well as for the protection of non-Indian residents in their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several recent laws is now negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment of their courts and the division of their common lands in severalty. The Pewtlon Roll. The diminution of our enormous pension roll and the decrease of pension expenditures which have been so often foretold still fail in material realization. The number of pension ers on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896. was 970.678. This is the largest number ever reported. The amonnt paid exclusively for pensions during the year was S138.214.761.ai, a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while the total expend itures on account of pensions, including the cost of maintainence of the department and expenses attending pension distribution amounted to 1 12.206.550.59. or within a very small fraction of one-third of the entire ex pense of supoorting the government during the same year. The number of new pension certifi cates issued was. 90.64a Of these 40,374 repre sent original allowances of claims and 15,873 increases of existing pensions. The number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but residing in foreign countries at the close of the last fiscal year was 3.7SI, and the amount paid to them during the year was S582.735.38. The sum appropriated for the pay ment of pensions for the current fiscal year, ending June 30. 1S97. is 140.0 X03i. and for the succeeding year it is estimated that the same amount will be necessary. The. Pacific Railroads. The secretary calls attention to the public Interests involved in an adjustment ef the ob ligations of the Pacific railroads to the govern ment I deem it to be an Important duty to es pecially present this subject to the consider ation of, the congress. On January II. 1897. with the amonnt already matured, more than 13.000,000 of the principal of the subsidiary bond issued by the United States in aid of the construction of the Union Pacific railway, in cluding its Kansas line, and more than 6,000, 000 of like bonds, issued in aid of the Central Pacific railroad, including those issued to the Western Pacific Railway Co., will have fallen due and . been paid or must on that day be paid by the government. With out any reference to the application of the sinking funds now in the treasury this will create such a default on the part of the companies to the government as will give it the right to at once institute proceedings to foreclose its mortgage lien. In addition to this indebtedness which will be. due January 1, 1897, there will mature between that date and January 1. 1S99, the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds which must also be met by the governments These amonnt to more than t2-).000,OOJ on account of the Union Pacific lines and exceeds 21.030,003 oa account of thj Central Pacific lines. The Agricultural Department. The department of agriculture Is so inti mately related to the welfare of our people and the prosperity of our nation that it should con stantly receive the care and encouragement of the government The secretary reports that the value of our exports of farm products dur ing the last fiscal . year amounted to 70.000.000. an Increase of 17,00J,000 over those at the year Immediately preceding This statement is not the less welcome be causo of the fact that notwithstanding such in crease, the proportion of exported agricultural products to our total exports of all description fell off during the year. The benefits of an in crease in agricultural products being assured, the decrease in its proportion to our total ex ports is more gratifying when we consider that it is coming to the fact that such total exports for the year increased more than t73.000.LCa The large and increasing exportation of our agricultural products suggests the great use fulness of the organization lately established in the department for the purpose of getting to those engaged in the farming pursuits re liable information concerning the condition, needs and advantages of different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success of the farmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and inasmuch as foreign mar kets must largely be the destination or such products, it is quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants that affect these markets ought to result in sowing more Intelligently and reap ing with a better promise of profit. Such information points out the way to a pru dent foresight in the selection and cultiva tion of crops and to a release from the bond age of unreasoning monotomy of protection, a glutted and depressed market and constantly recurring unprofitable toil. In my opinion the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the depart ment as at present conducted ought to bf discontinued. Civil Service Reform. The progress made in civil service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula tion. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well as the rancor of its Enemies, and has gained a permanent place among the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and improve, economize and elevate the public service. There are now in the competitive classified service upwards of 81.001 places. More than half of these have been included from time to time since March 4, 1S93. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by executive order dated the 6th day of May, 1893, and if fourth-class postmasterships are not in cluded in the statement it may be said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil service law are now classified. Abundant reasons exist for including these postmaster ships, based upon economy, improved service and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If. however, obstacles prevent such action at present, I earnestly hope that congress will, without increasing post office appropriations, so adjust them as to permit in proper cases of a consolidation of these post offices to the end that through this process the result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished. The Tariff. I desire to recur to the statements else where made concerning the government re ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operations. This statuta took effect on the 28th day of August. 1894. Whatever may be its shortcomings as a comptete measure of tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened up the way to a freer and greater ex change of commodities between us and other countries and thus furnished a wider morses for our products and manufactures. The only entire nscal year during which this law has been in force ended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In that year our imports increased over those of the previous year more tb-a $6,500,0 jo whpe the value of the domestic prod ucts exported and which found mar kets abroad was nearly iTO.O 0.009 more than during the preceding year. Those who Insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be increased through tariff changes to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the government, as well as those who claim that tariff changes may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and wita tie additional purpose of so increasing their price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that eur . tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the government to meet the necessary exp-nses of its maintenance. Con sidered as to Its sufficiency in this aspect the present law can by no means fall under just condemnation During the only complete fis cal year of its operation it has yielded nearly S8.0U0.000 more revenue than was received from tariff duties in the preceding year. Th ere was nevertheless a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a little more than 25,000. ooa This, however, was not unexpected. The situation was suoh in December last, seven months before the close of the fiscal year, that the secretary of the treasury fore told a deficiency of il7.o00.00a The great and Increasing apprehension and timidity in busi ness circles and the depression in all activities intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely uisconnectea wun our iann law or operation, seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise received and readily account for the difference between this estimate of the secre tary and the actual deficiency as well as for a continued deficit. I believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will in the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome all difficulties. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet such deficit we have in the treasury, in addition to a gold reserve of $I00.J0;,U00. a surplus of more than 128.000,0)0 applicable to payment of expenses of the government, and which must, unless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or. if not extravagantly was ted, must in any event be perverted from the purpose of its exaction from our people, the payment, therefore, of any deficiency in the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its proper and legitimate use. It is Immeasur ably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment of justifiable' expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appro priations and extravagant expenditures. I suppose it wi'l not be denied that under the present law oar people obtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate than formerly. This is a matter of supreme importance since it Is the palpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of . taxation as light as possible. The people should not be required to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living except under the stress of their government's necessity mad plainly manifest Oar Financial Methods. This reference to the condition and pros pects of our revenues naturally suggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our finan cial methods. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention of congress in pre vious executive communications and the in evitable danger of their continued toleration pointed out Without now repeating these de tails I cannot refrain from ajTiia earnestlv presenting the necessity of tho prompt reform
