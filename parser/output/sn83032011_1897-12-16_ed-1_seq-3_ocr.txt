THE COLUHBIAN, HOLIDAY EDITION. WASHINGTON. From our Keitular Correspondent. Washington, Dec, loth, 1S97. Secretary Gage is about the only iiiumuLi ui me auministraiion who would really like to see his recommen dations for cinching the hold of the Bingle gold standard on this country Decome laws. mr. Mcrunley did not dare to endorse the recommendations of his Secretary of the Treasury, and he has no real desire for the financial legislation he half-heartedly suezested. He knows that his roundabout sugges- lion, 01 getting riu ot the greenbacks by turning them into gold certificates could not get through Congress, even if only the republicans voted upon it. He was afraid that the recommenda tions for amending the National bank ing laws, so as to reduce taxation on National Bank currency, to allow cur rency to be issued to the face value ol the bonds deposited with the govern ment, and to allow the establishment of National banks with $25,000 capi tal in small places, might get through, so he added a proviso that he knew would kill the whole to make all National bank notes redeemable in gold. The administration is simply trying to bluff a portion of its own party and 'he country. It doesn't want any financial legislation. This has already been made plain in the House by the grab-game engineered by Mr. Dingley by which his commit teeWays and Means will take charge of all financial bills and smother them. Republicans have al so plainly indicated by their talk that they had received intimations from the administration that no financial legislation was wanted. If public criticism of its attitude makes its necessary to strengthen its bluff, the administration will, through Mr. Ding ley, fix up a bill and jam it through the House, knowing that the Senate would not act upon it. Of course, the people ot this country are fools enough not to know the difference between this sort of thing and real statesmanship, and they will be so sorry that the administration isn't able to get what it doesn't want so sorry that they'll elect a democratic Con gress next year. The administration doesn't wish the Nicaragua Canal question to be acted upon by this Congress, and when Mr. McKinley said in his mes sage that he would have something further to say on the subject when he admitted the report of the Commis sion which has just started for Nicar agua to make a new survey and esti mate of cost, under an act of Con gress, he was fully aware that the com mission was not likely to make a re port before the death of 4he Fifty fifth Congress. In fact, it is known that members of the commission were given a broad hint hefore their depart ure that their report was not expect ed before March 4, 1S99. One Nebraska republican Mr. Winfield S. Strawn, an Omaha lawyer -has turned up in Washington who is honest enough to publicly say that the republicans have no chance to carry that Stite, either at the Con gressional elections next year or the National election of 1900. Mr. Strawn says the republicans have not been able to get back the farmer votes they lost on the silver question, and that they are not likely to get them back so long as that question is unsettled. With the exception of Senators Morgan, of Ala., and Gorman, of Md., every democratic Senator is now lined up against the annexation of Hawaii, and the opposition among the repub licans already includes Senators Hoar, Morrill and Pettigrew. This makes it impossible to procure the two-thirds vote needed to ratify the treaty pro viding for annexation, and the repub licans are already seriously thinking of abandoning the treaty and trying to secure annexation by majority legisla tion. It looks a little as though the annexation question was going to be used by the Reed machine to whack McKinley over the head. The Czar is understood to have privately an nounced himself to be opposed to annexation. In fact, present indica tions are that before this session has grown very old the line between Mc Kinley republicans and Reed republi cans will be sharply drawn. If Spain isn't entirely pleased with the situation at the Washington end of the line she must be hard to please. It was a new thing for a President of the United States to devote nearly half of his message to Congress to an argument in favor of allowing a for eign nation more time in which to try to squeeze the life out of the people residing in sight of our coast, and the innovation was nauseous to many. A dose equally nauseous followed, when Secretary Gage presented several columns of solid newspaper matter, giving .in detail the extraordinary efforts of this country to aid Spain by suppressing filibustering. Senator Allen offered a resolution in the Sen ate for the recognition of Cuban inde pendence, but it is feared that the Committee on Foreign Relations, to which it was referred, will pigeon-hole it. 3 civil service law was pulled off in the House this week, and it was lively "lie 11 iaicu. a conierence of a ...... ...v.- .e uuubc Wno desire change in this Uv is to be held, in order to arrange for an organized Catarrh Onnnot be Cured with

Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade says : The opening of congress, with the president's annual message and re ports, has not discouraged business, as some predicted, but all speculative markets are stronger than a week ago. The productive industries, even in the season usually about the dullest of the year as to new orders, meet a definite improvement in demand for important products, presumably the fruit ot a prevailing conviction that new business will begin to crowd the works after the new year starts. 1 he outward movement of wheat and other products continues so heavy that foreign exchange has fallen three-quarters of a cent, and instead ol exports of gold which h.-ive marked uecemDer in recent years, imports would come if gold were wanted. Securities are advancing by reason of the increased earnings of railways, $47,085,801 for November on report ing roads in the United States, 16.8 per cent, larger than last year and 5.9 larger than in 1892. A sudden rise in December wheat at Chicago to $1.09 would do harm were it not based on avowed contracts to ship some millions of bushels to Europe. That fact and the continu ed foreign demand in spite of such contracts, has helped a rise of cents here. The report that western supplies are running low is discredited by receips from farms. Cotton is a sixteenth stronger in spite of estimates ranging from 10,- 100,000 to 11,009,000 bales by well known authorities. A strike in En glish mills' is no longer threatened, and the possibility of one at Fall Kiver nas nine weignt. There is more demand tor iron and steel products in preparation for rail way work, bridges and buildings next year and on contracts for export, in cluding one for a government bridge in Holland, others for bridges in Japan, with large shipments of various products to England and other conn tries. Foreign contracts for 40,000 tons rails are pending, 15,000 for Mexico. In and about New York bridge and building contracts call tor 25,000 tons, and Chicago works are figuring on numerous contracts for 5,00a rail way cars. Ihe formation of the American steel and wire company is expected to strengthen prices and cause some buying. While Bessemer at $10 and gray forge at $9.15 are slightly lower at Pittsburg, prices are stronger at Chicago and in all quarters heavy busi ness is expected after the new year. Connellsville coke production is 1 5 1. 1 00 tons weekly against 149,000 in November and no advance is now expected above $10.50 for furnace coke early next year. Anthracite coal is weaker and sells here at $3-75 to $3.85 for stove. Failures in the first week of Decem ber were but $2,617,240, manufactur ing $379.40 and trading $i,79I57o Failures for the week have been 3 1 2 in the United States against 380 last . . i- year and twenty-nine m uanaua against forty-three last year.

Sunrrin tendent Schaeu'or announces that it is a matter that effects every school dis trict in the State the new law gov erning the distribution of the State an propriation. The appropriation here tofore was distributed on a basis of the number of taxable residents. Com mencing next year the appropriation will be distributed on a basis of the number of resident taxables and of children between the uses of 6 and 16 years. Dr. Schaeffer, superintendent of public instruction, admonishes School directors to See that the rrf nrn made to the county commissioners by me assessors are correct, a3 after the returns made bv assessors have heen certified by the county commissioners iu ute siaie department and the ca . dilations for distribution of the appro priations begun, it will be too late to make corrections for the current ve.tr. The new law provides that on and after June 1, 1898, one third of the money annually appropriated for the common schools shall be distributed on the basis of the number rf tiswl teachers regularly employed ; that one third of the appropriation shall be dis tributed on the basis of the number of children of school age, between tne ace ol 6 and 16. the remaining one-third of the appropriation shall be uisinuuieo on tne basis of the num ber of taxables as returned bv the last bi-ennial assessment. The law makes it the duty of the county or ward assessor to make an enrollment of the total number of children of school age, between the age of 6 and 16 years, in addition to the duties required of them under existing laws and for the compensation rjer diem now allowed by law. The returns or assessments are to be filed m the office of the county commissioners. duly verified by oath or affirmation, 'i or before the fourth Saturday of December, 1897, and bi-ennially thereafter, the county commissioners to return a summary of the same to the superintendent of nnhlic instrnc t ion on or before the last Saturday of anuary next following. Any assessor .ho shall refuse or neglect to malic e enumeration and official returns required by this act, shall pay a fine r .1 ' ui iiui teas 11111 azn nor more nan too and be liable to removal from office. t'.i Head Relief in 10 Minutes.

The postoffice department at Wash ington is taking a firm stand against the so-called "missing letter" and "missing word" contests which are being conducted by a number of pub lishers to increase the subscriptions to their papers. The lottery law di rects that the postmaster eeneral. upon evidence satisfactory to himself that a concern or person is operating through the mails a lottery or scheme of regular prizes dependent upon lot or chance, to prohibit the delivery of all mail matter to it. Missing letter contests are held to be such violations, because many correct answers can be given, but only one list is deemed to be the "correct list by the promoters of the scheme. The chance consists in guessing what words compose the so-called "correct list." Such schemes are held to be especially obnoxious, owing to the skillful wording of the advertisements, which make the chance for obtaining a prize more re mote than in the deiunct Louisiana lottery. Glass Workers' Troubles. Manufactures Demand Concessions on Shop Rulos. The window glass workers and manufacturers of Pittsburg, are again in conference over the shop rules. It is difficult to predict the result, but it is safe to say the workmen must concede something, if an agreement is reached. President Burns express ed himself strongly respecting the implied threat that if the concessions demanded were not made the Ameri can Window Glass Company would cease to manufacture and import. Burns threatens to appeal to Congress. The cutters and ilatteners, having already left the Window Glass Work ers Association, will now leave the Knights of Labor and identify them selves with the American I ederation of Labor.

An act which may be ol interest to constables, as well as others, was passed by the last legislature relative to torest hres. It provides that town ship constables shall become ex otficio fire wardens, f-om Tan. i. 1808. They are equipped to take the neces sary measures for extinguishing forest fires in their townships, and for this purpose are authorized to call on anv person or persons in the township for aid. While thus engaged, they are to receive fifteen cents an hour, one half to be paid by the county and one- half by the state ; but no county is re quired to pay more than Icoo in anv one year. The constables are to make return, at each term of court, of any Violations known to them, of any pro vision of law for the protection of forests from fire. For a neglect of duty a constable mav be susnended from office, or convicted and sen- tenced to a fine not exceeding $50, or an imprisonment not exceeding three months, or both. Anv nerson refusing to assist the constable, when summoned, without reasonable cause, is liable to a fine not exceeding $10. or imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or both. The word "forest," for the purpose of the act, is to include an area of timber or brush land of not less than fifty acres, or a smaller area which may, by proximity to another tract of at least fifty acres, be liable to communicate fire to it. Carroll D. Wright, chief of the bu reau of statistics, recently discussed the question whether women are hurt ing the chances of men in business. "From tables based on the United States Censuses of 1870, 1880, 1890." says Wright, "it is found that the pro portion of women laboreis, all the oc cupations of the country being con sidered, is gradually increasing, not to an alarming extent, but yet steadily, the gain being a little less than three per cent. The census ot 1S70 record ed but one architect among the women of this country, while twenty-two were found in 1890. There were no women among the chemists, assayers, and metallurgists in 1870, while the enu meration in 1890 found forty six en gaged in these occupations. There were sixty-seven clercv women in 1870 and 1,235 in 1890. Dentistry has also attracted women, and while there were but twenty-four m 1870, there were 337 in 1890. The fact is absolutely demonstrated that the pro portion ot females in all occupations followed is gradually increasing. A study of all the facts shows that women are more generally taking the places of children than of men. In 1870 the percentage of children of the whole number of persons employed in manu facturing was 5.58, while in 1890 the percentage was only 2.68. There need not be any alarm, therefore, as to the encroachments of women upon the occupations held by men, for, on the whole, the encroachment is slicrht. Very many reasons are given by em ployers for their employment of women in place ot men, the most common being their greater adaptability for the particular work for which they are employed. Many employers also consider them more reliable, more easily controlled, cheaper, more tem perate, more easily procured, neater. more rapid, more industrious, more careful, more polite, less liable to strike, and more easily to learn. Of course very many employers gives a combination of two or more of these reasons. The facts relative to woman's compensation show that there is pro gress in her favor, although the sta tistics bring out a very great economic injustice in this respect. In one in vestigation it was shown that in 1871 instances in which men and women worked at the same occupation, and performed their work with the same degree of efficiency, men received greater pay in 595 cases and women greater pay in only 129, which in only fifty-seven instances out of the whole number did they receive the same pay for the same work, which is only 7.3 per cent, of the cases noted." Wyoming and Utah have laws accord ing to men and women equal wages for equal work. They're 8windlers. Several months ago two suck in dividuals were in Milton soliciting orders for a patent asbestos pot which they said retailed at $1.00. Their scheme was to get an advance of fifty cents from each costumer which they did in many cases. Of course, the buyer never heard of them again.
