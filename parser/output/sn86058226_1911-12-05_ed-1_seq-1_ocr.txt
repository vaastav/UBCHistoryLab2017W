A cavalryman picking up a dispatch just dropped by the airman that lie may ride to headauarter with it. From a sketch from the London Illustrated News, When the aero plane takes flight for a scouting expedition, acavalryman escorts it as far as he can with reasonable safety. It is his business to act as dispatch-rider between the airman and headquarters. The aviator, having scribbled his notes, makes a rough package of them, and drops them as nearly as possible at the cavalryman's feet. Then they are picked up and carried to their destination, while a second horseman takes the place of the first. Thus a series of messengers serve the airman, who is kept in close touch with his commanding officer. It may here be noted that the air man acting as bomb-dropper fills each bomb as he wants it while he is in flight, holding the case between his knees and the schew-cap between his teeth, and pouring the ingredients in as best he can. He does not start his flight with bombs loaded, lest, by mischance, he should fall to the ground, thus cause the bombs to explode, and so be hoist with his own petard. Each bomb is about the size of an orange, and is of steel. DUTY OF SURGEON RELATED' TO JURY Interesting Instructions by Court in the King Damage Case. Definition of the duties imposed up on physicians and surgeons, as these duties are recognized in the eyes of the law, is made by Judge H. C. Fox of the circuit court in his instructions to the jury, deliberating on the mal practice case of Leota King against Dr. Frank Harold, who demands $2ji)00 damages for alleged unskillful treat ment of a double fracture of her little finger on the left hand. The jury re ceived the case Tuesday afternoon af ter four days of testimony and argu ment. Tersely the court ruled that when a physician or surgeon held himself out to the public as such he must possess the ordinary qualifications and skill, usually and ordinarily possessed by physicians and surgeons practicing in the same neighborhood. He does not have to be rarely .endowed with skill, but must in accepting cases, exercise reasonable care and his best judgment. He is liable for an injury only when he does not exercise ordinary care and his best judgment, as these qualifica tions in a prficticioner are recognized in the community in which he prac tices. Mrs. King was injured in March 1909. She said that Dr. Harold re duced the double fracture by binding it in adhesive tape without inserting splits. The physician alleged he did use cardboard splints, winding the tape about these. Physicians and sur geons were called upon the stand to testify in the capacity of experts as medicine and surgery is practiced in this city. They approved of the meth od which Dr. Harold said he employ ed In reducing and treating the frac ture. THE WEATHER STATE AND LOCAL Fair and wirm- cr tonight; Wednesday fair.

Deploring the conditions of the rail road crossings in this city regarding the matter of safe-guarding the public from accidents. Mayor Zimmerman at the meeting of the board of public works Monday made a motion to the effect that in any future conference between the board and the officials of the Pennsylvania railroad company, that the board insist upon the tracks of the company being elevated so as to permit undergrade crossings. Mayor Zimmerman declared that the cross ings were entirely too dangerous un der the present arrangement for guar ding them. It is estimated it would require an enormous sum to raise' the tracks of the company, and there is a great deal of doubt among city officials as to whether the railroad company would ever consider the advisability of ele vating the tracks. At a previous meeting of the board of public works the mayor made a mo tion to the effect that both railroad companies be forced to maintain elec tric are lights at every railroad cross ing, and to station watchmen at the crossings, both day and night. Nettle ton Neff, superintendent of the Rich mond division of the road, has re quested the board to do nothing fur ther with this matter until he can con fer with the board. The -board desires to widen West Main street from Fifth street to the corporation . line and - instructed the civil engineer to prepare plans and specifications for this. D. H.

Johnson, secretary of the board of trustees, following the report sub mitted to council at a previous meet ing by Councilman Frank L. Waidele, of the Seventh ward, in which he al leged the institution could be better managed and placed upon a paying ba sis. Scope of The Probe. The main points upon which the committee will work are those brought out in the report, which charged mis management. The report alleges that for the care of railroad patients only $1.50 per day per patient is charged, while for other patients $1.90 per day is charged. It further alleged that money being expended for the comfort of nurses at the hospital should be devoted rto the treatment and care of the patients. The report claims that more nurses are employed at the Reid hospital than at other hospitals, comparatively speaking. The committee will also in vestigate the statement contained in the report to the effect that if physi cians were appointed on the board of tfustaea InsUtuUoaould he man aged more successfully.

Councilman Frank Waidelee, who submitted the report on the hospital, and who is now confined there owing to a nervous breakdown, caused by worry over the matter, was extended the sympathy of his colleagues in a resolution presented by Councilman Weishaupt, last evening, and unani mously adopted. ' "Mr. Waidele is a hard working and ardent councilman, and the work he had done for the citizens has brought on a serious collapse," Mr. Weishaupt said. "I move that we, as a body, ex tend to bim our sympathy and as a to ken of appreciation of his work send him a bunch of flowers and an expres sion of hope for his speedy recovery." Mr. Weishaupt was appointed chair man of a committee to present the res olution and flowers to Mr. Waidele. A request was made to council by Dr. F. P. Busche, Mr. Waidele's phy sician, to relieve him of his council manic duties until he is fully recover ed. Dr. Busche stated in a letter to council that Mr. Waidele's physical condition will not allow him to resume his duties in council for some time. Consequently Mr. Waidele will be re moved from the chairmanship of the contract and franchise committee and another member of council will be ap pointed. Mayor Zimmerman stated that he would not make public the name of the councilman whom he will place at the head of this committee until the next meeting night. 

SENTENCE TDD LIGHT Local Labor Leaders Dis pleased with Judgment. In no uncertain terms members of various local unions expressed them selves on Monday upon the McXamara case, declaring that union men here as well as in other parts of the coun try were led to believe the McXamara brothers were not guilty and they re ceived a large amount of money and support from thousands of union men by misleading them.

Mc Xamara waj given a life sentence and John B., his brother was sentenced to fifteen years in prison was heard, sev eral union men declared that the sen tences were too light.

TRUST PROBLEM IS DEALT WITH TODAY BY THE PRESIDENT In His Message to Congress the Chief Executive Asks Legislation to Supplement Sherman Law. TAKES ISSUE WITH ROOSEVELT'S VIEWS Denies Government Intends Confiscating the Property of Any of the Offending Corporations. The President's Message, in full, will be found on the first page of the second section of this issue. (National News Association) 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President Taft sent a special message to con gress today dealing exclusively with the trust problem. The President gave his own views on its solution, demanded legislation to supplement the Sherman anti-truBt law and took direct issue with criticism of the dis solution plan for the American Tobac co company, as expressed by ex-President Theodore Roosevelt in The Out look. Among the recommendations made by President Taft are demands for a law specifically defining "restraint of trade and suppression of competition," a federal corporation commission and a federal incorporation act. He up holds the Sherman law and defends the results of litigation under that measure. In defending the action of the U. S. supreme court in the Standard Oil decision, in reading the .word "unreas onable" into the law, President Taft deplored the agitation for the repeal of the law which has sprung up since the Standard and American Tobacco trusts were dissolved. Cites Court Rullncs. The message, which contains be tween 6,000 and 7,000 words is accom panied by numerous extracts from court decisions to uphold Mr. Taft's contentions. One feature of the message is con tained in a paragraph in which Pres ident Taft disavows the intention of the government of confiscating prop erty of offending corporations. The President calls attention to the fact that imprisonment is one form of pun ishment provided for in the anti-trust law for offenders. Mr. Taft declares that the Sherman law protects business and says that "the mere size of a corporation is no sin against the anti-trust" law. In his plea for supplemental legisla tion to the Sherman act, the President says that it would be a great aid to the government in bringing future anti-trust suits because the proceedings could charge a misdemeanor instead of the cumbersome method of charg ing a conspiracy and naming an unus ually large number of defendants. Mr. Taft advocates that the bureau of corporations be a tribunal of the dignity and power of the comptroller of currency and be modelled after the interstate commerce commission. He call the anti-trust law "the expression of effort of liberty loving people to preserve equality of opportunity." "For twenty years," he said, "this statute (Sherman law) was on the statute books. All knew its general purpose and approved. Many of its violators were cynical over its as sumed impotence."
