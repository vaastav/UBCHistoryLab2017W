application of R ibert Stockton a citizen of Missouri to be re leased from custody and imprisonment of M 0 Meador a constable of Precinct No 1 Smith county Texas who holds him unjustly and unlawfully and in violation of the constitution of the United States as it is alleged on a charge to the effect that Stockton on November 11887 in the county of Smith state of Texcis did then and there unlawfully pursue the oc cupation of a commercial traveler The said occupation being taxed by law and the said Robert C Stockton did then and there unlawfully and willfully fail and refuse to exhibit to M 0 Meador constable in and for precinct No 1 Smith county Tex upon demand there for then and there duly made by aaid cfller of said R C S ockton a receipt of the Comptroller of Public Accounts sho vy ing the piyment of the occupation tax due by flaid R C Stockton to said state upon said occupation against the peace and dignity of the state The petitioner claims that he is a citizsn of the United Sates and has been a citzan of the state of Missouri for over five years and was such at the time of the arrest complained of and when arrested was only temporarily in Texas and was engaged in selling gooris Dy sample for the wholesale h use of W A Wilson Co of Knsas City that said W A Wilson Co have no business house in Texj s that each member of sild firm is a resident and citizen of Kansas City Mo and of the Unittd States and thit the applicant is ennag d in what is commonly known as drumming and represents said W A Wilson Co and no other firm selling their gcods and taking orders by sample which he carries with him and filling said orders by shipping the goods from Missouri into Texas to those jrom whom he secures orders that on the said 1st day of No vember he was eo engaged in selling such goods when he was approached by said RIeador and requested to exhibit to him the receipt of the Comptroller of Public Acounts showing payment of occupati > d iak by him as a flQmmrcial traveler and upon his failure to txhibitsuch receipt he was then and there and thereafter arrest ed by said Meador by virtue of a warrant upon the charge herein set forth The petitioner claims that he has not nor ever had the receipt referred to and that he is unjustly and unlawfully de tained by said Meador in violation of the constitution of the United States in that the law of the state of Texas upon which such prosecution is f junded so far as it affects the complainant is in conflict with the constitution cf the United States which gives to Congress the ex clusive righ to regulate commerce be tween thestntes Therefore he prays to be relieved from said unlawful detention and imprisonment and for a writ of haoeas corpus and the action of this court therein The prosecution was on inform itiou of the County At torney of Smith doanty based upon the tflilavit of Mr Meador filed in the County coarfc cf Smith county Texas upon which the warrant of arrest was issued by virtue of whiih the arrest was made Tne writ of bab as corpus was in this behalf from this court upon the application of Stock ton N ivf mber i 1S87 and served on Meaoor November 5 1S37 and to which he made his return there jn Njvember 7 1887 in which he states that he now here brings Into ihis court the body of the within named R C St xkton and certifies that he holds faid Stockton in durets by order o the efiiJavlt information and capias true copies of which are attacned tothewrit of habeas corpus hereio At the instance of the Hon James S EL gg Attorney General of the state of Texaa who had been at once furnished by order of the court with a copy of the writ of habeas corpus which emoodied the ap plication therefor the hearing was de ferred with the consent of the applicant and November 17 1887 said Attorney General appeared and claimed that the state of Texas by her At torney General now here in open court suggests that she is a proper party to tnis cause for the reason that involves it 1 The right of her lawful offi cers to execute the lawful process under the laws of the state 2 That it involves the constitutionality of one of her laws 3 That it assails her right loaise a rev enue from a lawful source whereupon he aeka to be permitted to appear and be en tered of record here as a party to this proceeding which was accordingly done and allowed whereupon the hearing was proceeded with R C Stockton ap pearing in person and by his counsel the Hon John MDuncan M 0 Meador in person and the Hon James S Hogg At torneyGeneral in behalf of the state of Texas The proof adduced amply and fully established the facts set forth in the petition for habeas corpus and clearly exhibited the fact that the merchants and citizens of states other than Ttxas doing business in Texas through drummers and selling by samples of goods without the state and to be delivered therein on sale regarded the drummers tax as without warrant of law and oppressive and unjust and a opposed to the con stitution of the Uaited StJtes and the settled decisions thereon by the Supreme court of the United States and had come to the firm determination to make resistance thereto by due course of law in an appeal to the courts and which views and determinationvwere like 

FOBT WORTH TEXAS FRIDAY DECEMBER 9 1887 wiso entertained by the drummers them selves and R C Stockton the relator or applicant herein being tae first party arrested has sued out this writ he being a drummer cf W A Wilson Co citi zens cf Missouri having no goods in Texas and doing business as citizens of Missouri in the state of Texas through the agency of said Stock ton in selling by sample their goods in Missouri to be delivered in Texas on sale by sampe to citizens of Trxas or persons residing therein The clause of the constitution that the appli cant Stockton claims to have been viola ted by any state law no matter w at which may have called for his arrest is as follows Section 8 The Congreps bhall have power 3 to regulate commerce with foreign natIontJamong the several states and with the Indian tribes 18 to mate all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carry ing into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the United States or in any department or office thereof The portion of the law complained of by the applicant as void and insisted upon by the state as valid is as follows namely Article 4GG5 that there shall be levied on and collected from every person firm company or association of persons pursuing any of the following named occu pations an annual tax except when here in otherwise provided on every such oc cupation or separate establishment as follows From every commercial trav eler drummer silesman or solicitor of trsdej by sample or otherwise an annual occupation tax of > 35 payable in advance providedjthat the tax herein rtquired to be paid by such commer cial traveler drummer salesman or solic ltor shall be paid to the Comptroller of Public Account whose seal shall be evidence of such tax and provided no county city or receipts under the payment of further that town shall levy or collect any occupation tax upon such commercial traveler drummersales man or solicitor provided that nothing herein contained shall apply to anyone collecting subscri > tions for religious literary or historical bocks or maps or to persons soliciting for nurseries newspa pers and grave stones provided further that every commercial traveierdrummer salesman or solicitor of trade shall on demand of the tax collector of any county of the state or any peace officer of said county exhibit to such offier the Comp trollers receipt above mentioned and every commercial traveler drummer salesman or solicitor of trade who shall fail or refuse to exhibit said receipt to such officer on de mand by him shall be decreed eui tv of a misdemeanor and fined in a sum of not less than 25 nor more than the sum of 100 It is thi3 portion of the stat ute that the relator Stock ton claims is void by reason of being obnoxious to the provisions of the United S ates constitution and therefore void The state of Texas claims that it is a valid law and that she is entitled to have it in forced and that it is not so void This law imposes a tax in the first place upon all drummers wnether acting as agents for citizens oi other states in selling their goods therein to citizens or people of this state by sam ple of such goods or not and then pro vides a penalty for not producing a receipt showing the payment thereof to the Comptroller when demanded by the proper officer and failing to pay such fine or penalty he may be arrested by other laws be thrown into jail and set to work on the county farm until he can ex mguish the same through enforced labjr at the rates fixed slaw The obj ct of the penalty to enforce the payment of an liwful tax declared in direct violation w the constitution of the United aj sanQ < hat fiiling the penalty for Jts lsobednce also fails or in other wom the erhire section is null and voit ano the satoe being in direct violation of the constitu tion of the United States Tne statesmen soldiers and patriots who cast their lives liberties and sacred honor for and in defense of American liberty and for the foundation of a free and representative government for a free people upon the hazird of successful revolution have pissed away but the sacred principle of no taxation without representation for which they struggled still survives and today remains one of the grand corner stones of our government and is pro tected by paragraphs 3 and 18 in section 8 above referred to in the constitu tion of the Uaited States What representation has the citizen of one state in the laws of another state affecting his commerce therein Precisely none But the Con e ess alone represents the people of the United States na well as the states in h ir mutual affairs Neither stats can say for itself what taxes it will place upon the lawful commerce of cit zsns of another state within its oorders the property of such other citi zun not being therein This is simply a question of If a state can make power a tax at all upon interstate commerce it can dj almost anything J n tiat line What would Ttfe tiought of New York St New England states if they weiSe to tax the citizens of Texas or other southern states for the sale of all cotton hides wool and other articles of com merce sought to be sold therein by their agents drummers or factors by levying a tax upon such sales by sample therein Why it would be claimed by every citizen of the United States who adheres to the doctrine of NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTA TION that the citizens of Texas and other states were not represented in making such laws they were void as to them and their agents as a tax on their agents was practically a tax on their business and if carried out or tol erated would allow one state virtually to lay an embargo on the commerce of any one or more states which would be pre posterous The idea of a citizen of the United States being challenged anywhere in this nation by any power other than national in the conductfo his lawful business in states other rciairi his own is decidedly absurd and riccu lous He never has had a chance to wjta in tne state not his own upon that Jfb ject He has voted m his JUS gressional district no < ibX fa nls representative in Gongrfss andfe it Is not unlikely that cljfze jkpthgx states have voted in their5esp ectlv n gressional districts for tbirfr representa tives and when they all meet in Congress whatever they may lawfully determine therein will be obeyed and observed by each and every citizen in this broad land The people of this nation no matter what state citizenship bow to nothing save the will of Heaven and their own In domestic afliirs they express that will through their Legisla ture and it is observed by all good peo Dle In interstate matters they ex press that will if any through Congress and it is the pride of all good citizens as well as states to observe and respect it If the power by the constituclon has been lodged in Con gress in this case and Congress shall not have acted both states and people mustWAIT WAIT UNTIL CONGRESS LEGISLATES upon the subject There is no state or community or individuals that can make any law at all upon that subject The law In question is utterly void iu so far it affects the commerce of the citizens of other states having no goods herein but selling by sample and particularly R C Stockton the applicant for habeas corpus here as agent drummer or commercial traveler for W A Wilson Co of Kan sas City and he must be discharged and released from custody and have and re cover all costs hereiu The following are the authorities relied upon as settling the law in this case viz Robbins vs Shelby County Taxing District Tenn 120 United States Su preme court reports page 489 Farso vs Michigan 121 United States Supreme court reports page 230 Philadelphia and Southern Steamship

at the capital as the water does not agree with him He has made a favorable impression by his quiet and dignified manners and the predic tion is made that he will make an envi able record as a zealous

these appointments were to be made that they occasioned no sur prise but there seems to be a feeling akin some of the southern Congressmen The south 1 ises one of its places in the Cabinet without gaining anything by way of com pensation as the appointment of Mr Lamar to the Supreme bench is to succeed Justice Woods who was chosen to repre sent the south The judicial circuit over which Mr Lanmr
