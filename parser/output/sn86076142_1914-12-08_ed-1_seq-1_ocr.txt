From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments. While we maintain our present principles, we shall never have a large standing army. If asked, are you ready to de fend yourselves? we reply, most as suredly, to the utmost; and yet we shall not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves. We must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, not yet upon a reserve army, but upon citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, dependent on our principles and policies, to provide a system whereby every citizen who will volunteer for the training will be made familiar with the use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill and maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps.
