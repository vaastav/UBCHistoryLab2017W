HE woman of America will be very much shocked to hear of a little sign which occupies a place on the banks of the Yuen-Fule river in Foochow: "Do Not Drown Female Infants Here."

"I twas an experience that brought out as nothing else could the common brotherhood of man," says the general. This is no doubt largely true of the human race where civilization has had its influence. Men are, as a rule, more considerate of each other in distress than happiness, in disaster than in success, and when they are face to face with death they drop the little nesses that surround them in life.

THE striking operators of the Rock Island railroad hare established a free OUR NAVY. Its Rapid Development as Shown by the Report of Secretary Tracy. WASHINGTON, Dec. 12. Secretary Tracy in his report to the president starts out with a list of vessels in the navy, and points with pride to the work accomplished during the present administration. He says: "On the 4th of March, 1889, the fleet of the United States navy, apart from a few old ships long since obsolete and fast going to decay, con sisted of three modern steel vessels, of an ag gregate tonnage of 7,863 tons, and mounting thirteen 6-inch and four 8-inch guns, thefbrgings (or which last, as well as the shafting for the vessels, had been purchased from abroad, as they could not be made in this country. "There have been a total of nineteen vessels of the new navy put in commission during this administration, of an aggregate tonnage of 54,- B33 tons, mounting altogether two 13-inch, six 10-inch, sixteen 8-inch and eighty two 6-inch guns, all of which, with the exception of five of the earliest, have been manufactured in this country. Three new steel tugs have also been construced and put in service during this period. There are eighteen vessels in process of construction and certain to be completed, should their armor be delivered within the next year, of an aggregate tonnage of 93,407 tons and mounting alto gether twelve 13-inch, six 12-inch, sixteen 10- inch, thirty 8-inch, thirty-two 6-inch, thirty eight 5-inch and thirty-four 4-inch guns, all of which have been or are to be manufactured in this country. During this period twenty-five vessels will have been launched, thirteen of them, including the three tugs, during the cur rent year, and of all the new ships the con struction of which has been begun during the present administration only two will remain on the stocks on the 4th of March next. "Our new navy including all vessels built or authorized, now consists of the following ves sels: One sea-going battleship (first class Iowa. Three coast-line battleships (first-class) Massachusetts, Indiana, Oregon. Two battle ships (second class)Maine, Texas. Six double-turreted harbor-defense vesselsPuri tan. Monterey, Miantonomoh, Monadnock, Ter ror, Amphitrite. Two armored cruisersNew York, Brooklyn. One rani. Two protected cruis ers of extreme speedColumbia, Minneapolis. Fourteen cruisersOlympia, Baltimore, Chi cago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Charleston, Newark, Boston, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Raleigh, Detroit, Montgomery, Marblchead. One dis patch vesselDolphin Six gunboatsYork town, Concord, Bennington, Machias, Castine, Petrel. One dynamite vesselVesuvius. One practice vesselBancroft Two torpedo boats -Pushing, No. 2, making a total of forty-two vessels. "All the above, with perhaps one or two ex ceptions, are essential components of a fully developed naval force, but the rel ative contribution to the defensive power of the United States to be found in these groups of vessels is not to be measured either by the number of ships or the number of tons alone. The develop ment of the last four years has not been con fined to ships alone. At the beginning of this administration the naval establishment was entirely destitute of certain elements of effi ciency, each one of which was indispensable to its practical employment as a fighting force, and the absence of which, if it had been pos sessed of a hundred ships, would still have left it in a condition of paralysis. These were the following Armor, torpedoes, heavy rapid-fire guns, armor-piercing shells, smokeless powder, high explosives. The secretary details at length noteworthy progress in the production of these things, and says the progress noted, by which the United States has emerged from its condition or help lessness at sea and by the employment of its own resources has distanced its most experi enced competitors, marks an epoch in naral de velopment not only of this country but of the world. Cpming'down to a detailed statement as to armor tests the secretary tells of the work ac complished, of the tremendous test to which the Harvey nickel-steel armor plate was sub jected, as the result of which improved meth ods were introduced in the Harvey process, and continues: "Tne result has never been equaled or even approached before by any armor plate, Amer icaii or foreign. It has demonstrated that the United States, in the reconstruction of its new navy, which ten years ago had no existence even on paper, is enabled to place upon each and all of its armored vessels a material the like of which the world, up to this time, has not seen and that while vast sums have been spent in plating the sides of foreign men-of-war with an inferior ma terial, this country will employ for the purpose an armor which is not only far more efficient, but which represents unquestionably, having reference to the dimensions of plates thus far tested, the highest development of modern science, and a development reached by its own independent efforts. "Following the example of the United States, the English government four weeks ago held a trial of the new American armor, and it is clear from the highly successful results of the trial that the United States, instead of being the last in the race in the construction of vessels of war or of borrowing its best ideas from abroad, has set an example in this respect which other maritime powers will speedily follow." In reference to ordnance of the navy the secretary makes extended reference to develop ments promising greatly improved results. Comment is also made at length as to powder manufacture, high explosives and projectiles, all showing progress of the most satisfactory nature. With regard to torpedoes, while *he Howell torpedo has not gone much beyond the stage of hope with which the department en tered upon a contract for its manufacture four years ago, yet the latest trials are giving great promise. The secretary speaks with much satisfaction of the act to "encourage American ship build- ing," under which the City of Paris and City of New York are admitted to American reg istry. The aggressive policy of foreign nations con tinues, and this count*v- whether it will or not, will soon be forced into a position where it cannot disregard measures which form a standing menace to its prosperity and security. On the isthmus our commerce is engaged in a desperate fight to maintain its foothold. In the south Pacifio repeated annexations and protectorates are extending the power and in fluence of the maritime states of the old world. Subsidized lines of fast steamers are completing the circle of maritime communi cation on the eastern and western coasts of the Dominion of Canada and fortresses daily increasing in strength are surrounding our coast upon the south and east. Under these circumstances it is imperative to the welfare of this country that the policy of naval recon struction* %o successfully carried on in the past, should suffer no interruption in the future. Much space is devoted to Interesting details as to the operations of ships in commission the last year in Behring sea and elsewhere on the work of the marine hospital bureau in connec tion with cholera quarantine, etc Interesting statistics are given as to the growth of the gov ernment toward establishing naval militia, the creation of which is characterized as one of the rmost important steps in our recent naval prog ress. The estimates in the report for the fiscal year ending June 30,1894, for navy and marine corps, including those for public works and increased navy, are $24,471,498, being 82,713,141 less than those for the last fiscal year.
