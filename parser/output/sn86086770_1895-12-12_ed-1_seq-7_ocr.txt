Stevenson as their own successors. Of the holding-over senators, whose terms will expire two years from now, some of the most prominent, Including Blackburn, Brice, Hill. Voorhees, Vest. Vilas and Fetter, took the'.r seats with the shadow hanging over them of strong probability that their places might be filled by others when this congress expires.

Mr. Sherman, republican, of Ohio, offered a resolution to inform the house that the senate was ready for business. On motion of Mr. Vilas, democrat, of Wis consin, a committee of two was ap pointed to join a similm committee on the part of the house to wait upon the president and the vice presldent namlng as such committee Mr. Vilas and Mr. Allison.

Washington, Dec. 4. —The senate worked today, while the house enjoyed u recess, but m’ost of the business transacted was of a routine character.
