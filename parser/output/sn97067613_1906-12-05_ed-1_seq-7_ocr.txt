For this reason among ot hers, it is might v difficulty to lay out ami continue on anv particular line of work. Whatever work is left undone at any long session, the first one ol any Congress, is left in statu quo and un disturbed until the hYal or shoit ces sion. Whatever is left undone at that session dies beyond resurrection at its dissolution March, fourth, la this connection it may be instructive to see what was kit on the calendars and in eoamittees on adjournment last spring. I spoke of a few of these matters last week which vvt re out in the open, but besides them are hun dreds ol others which have not yet teen the light. On the Senate Calendar there are seventy-eight measures reported and ready for acion, and in the House are more than three hundred and fifty public and privatebillsnovva waiting action, beside those unreported and yet in committee. These latter ate legion, and many of them are of the greatest importance Among them is Senator Frye's ship subsidy bill, which passed thescjiate last session and which is said to have been heli' up in the House Committee by the influence of Speaker Cannon. He is s&id to be opposed to ship subsidy on principle, but the friends of the meas uiearebopefulof makingadeal wh ch will permit it to go through. A river and harbor improvement appropriation hill is customary at the end of each Congress, and it is hinted that the ship subsidy people will hold up the river and harbor bill unless the friends of the lattir, which includes most everybody, consent to allow the shipping bill togo through. This mutual back-scratching scheme is frequently resorted to in order to "get together" on two measures, neither of which would -stand alone. An investigation has been under way for some time by a special com mittee of Congress looking toward a general revision of rates of postage on all mail matter, and it is expected that a report will soon be made. Chairman Overstreet of the House committee on postofficcs, is of the opinion, however, that no radical change will be mndYin the rates on newspapers and ether regular period icals whicharenowincludedin second class matter, Mr. W. 1). Uoyce of Chicago, publisher of certain more or less well known semi literary week lies and president of the National Weekly Publisher's Association, has been here this week and paralyzed the postoffice department by offering tobuv it outright of thegovernment. lie told the officials that he repre sented a body of eminent financiers, most of whom were publishers and patrons of the mails to the extent of hundieds of thousands of dollars an nually, that they knew the mail set vice thoroughly, and were ready, with millions of dollars back of them, to take it over and operate it as a pri vate enterprise. With this was guarantee of beneficient changes large reductions in postal rates' and an incieased sei vice everywhere. Mr, Boyce said that, in the first place they would reduce all present postage rates one-half. They would wipe out the present deficit of twenty five mil lion dollars annually, takeall respon sibility on the government and pav in all surplus profits a ove a net 7 percent. With this thee would also do a postal, check and press parcel business at a very small C'ist. Of course no such hn gain can be made at present, but t '.si t such an offer can be genuinely ar.sl sincerely made indicates the trend ol the times and will set the peoi'- to thinking. On the whole, why not ? Opponents of government owr)'hip of rail roads, telegraph, tel phone and ex press companies use a m argument that the government -i mid not go into such business. It i he-are right how can they object t putting the postal business back into th hands of a private corporation where th'se other named industries -re nov? Why shouldn't the post 1 1 business be conducted like the r til-oad or express business, when yu come to think of it? But this i big ques tion, and the mere di cussion of it indicates that the w" :d do move."
