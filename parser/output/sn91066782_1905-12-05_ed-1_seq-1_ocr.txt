THE A 7D) 7 TIMES RATE REGULATION RECOMMENDED BY PRESIDENT; 'Would Have Congress Enact Law Making Special Com mission Having Power to Curb the Railroads UNDER PENALTY ' v OF HEAVY FINE Urges Congress to Adopt . Treaty With Santo Domin go Calls For Economy in Administration. '.Washington, D. C, Dec. S. The an nual president's message was delivered to Congress by President Roosevelt this afternoon. The address opens with a .plea for co-operation of all classes in con tinuingthe nation's prosperity and in correcting existing evils. The moBt im portant points relate to corporations and .railroad rate legislation. The President eays: Corporations. I am la no sense hostile to corpora tion. This Is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combina tion will be not ouly useless, but In the nd vicious, because of the contempt for law which the failure to enforce law Inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to stay, Just as the trades union has come to stay. EaA -can do and has done great good. Each should be favored Bo long as it does good.' But each should be sharply -checked where It acts against law and justice, , Experience has shown conclusively that It Is useless to try to get any ade quate . rejrulstlon find supervision of these great corporations by state ac tlon. Such regulation and supervision an only be effectively exercised by a sovereign whose Jurisdiction Is eoex tensive with the field work of the cor porationsthat Is, by the national gov- rnmelit. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the congress. If this proves Impossible, It will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer In fullest form auch power upon the na tlonal government by affirmative ac- ment of the constitution. The laws of the congress and of the several states hitherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often in showing thut the states have no power In the matter than that the na tlonal government has power; so that there at present exists a very unfortu nate condition of things, under which these great corporations doing an in terstate business occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national government having effective control over them. Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereignty of the na tlonal government by affirmative ac tion, f : This is only In form an innovation. In substance It is merely a restoration, for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies, and all that I propose Is to meet the changed conditions in such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power it has always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also la England before and since this country became a separate .axion. , - Railroad Rite Legislation. As I said in my message of Dec. last, the immediate and most pressing need sd far as legislation is concerned is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision arid regu laiiou of the rates charged by the rail roods of the country engaged in Inter state traffic as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent the imposition of uu just or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to re bates In every shape and form. " This power to regulate rates, like all similar - powers over the business world, should be exercised with moderation, caution and self restraint, but it should exist, bo that it can be effectively exercised wneu tne need arises. In my Judgment, the most Important - provision which sucn law should con- tain Is that conferring upon sbme com petent administrative body the power to decide upon the case being brought of Railroad Rate Legislation , Block Signals for Railroads -Limit Hours of Railroad Em ployees) Regulate Injunction in Labor Dis putes . Child Labor Legislation in States More Strict and Uniform Insur ance Legislation Change vTariff When Conditions Demand It . Economy in Appropriations Business Methods in Departments Prevent Bribery and Corruption in Federation Elections (Corporation Gifts) Co-operation in The Hague Tri bunal Enforcement of Monroe Doctrine Adopt Santo Domingo Treaty Increased Efficiency of Army and Navy Revise Naturalization Law Care for Confederate Graves Regulate Interstate Commerce in Unbranded and Adulterated Food, Etc, Make Torto Rteans American CSti- zena -Alaska, Be Given Elective Delegate Indian Territory and Oklahoma, Become One State and New Mexico and Arizona Another oerore It wuetber a given rate pre scribed by a railroad is reasonable and Just, and if it ia found to be unreason able and unjust then, after full investi gation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as It is commonly call edthis decision to go into effect with in a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate is too high, but that a fa vored shipper ia given too low a rate. In such case the commission would have the right to fix this already estab lished minimum rate as the maximum, and it would need only one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper minimum rates. I call our attention to the fact that my pro posal is not to give tne commission power to initiate or originate rates gen erally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or orlgtnated by the roads upon complaint aud after investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted from any corporation which falls to respect an order of the commission. I regard this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform In the matter of railway regulation. It Is worth while considering whether It would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for iat least twice the value of the rebate. (This would help stop what Is really blackmail. Elevator allowances .should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demor alizlng and are used as rebates. lvnte Car Line. All private car lines, industrial roads. refrigerator charges and the like should be expressly put under the su pervision of ' the interstate commerce commission Of some similar body so far ns rates nnd agreements practical-1 ly affecting rates are concerned. A re-; bate in Icing charges or In mileage or ia a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is Just as pernicious as a re bate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now (conducted into the national banks by the bank examiners. A few first class railroad accountants, If they bad prop er direction and proper authority to in spect books and papers, could accom plish much in preventing willful viola tions of the law. Employer' Liability Law. In my annual message to the Fifty eighth congress at its second session I recommended the passage of an em ployers liability law for the District of Columbia and In our navy yards. I re newed that recommendation in my message to the Fifty-eighth congress at Its Becond session and further suggest ed tho appointment of a commission to make a crtiiiprebeusive sudy of em ployers' liability with a view to the en actment f"' a wise and constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to nil Industries within the scope of the federal power. I hope that such a law will be prepared and enacted as speed ily as possible. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue Injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts wouid bo most unwise. It Is true that some judges have misused this power, but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an Improper ex ercise of the d .-wor to call a strike bv a Contiaued on Fourth Page.

BETTING ON PROSPECT OF AN EXECUTION Wndsor People Think Mary Rogers Will Be Hanged, While Others Think That Something Will Intervene. Windsor, Dec. 5. A general standstill now on, the only exciting features being the attempts of the prison officials to keep out of reach of newspaper report ers, and all day long the little court beneath the "bridge of sghs" is patrolled by a guard protected from the cold by ulsters. There are many heated conver sations of the representatives of the press as they express their digust when they are turned away, not even being allowed to get by the first doors, ihey are then obliged to resort to imagina tion for a story. On the street greetings are generally jocular. It w the general belief that Mrs. liog- ers will hang, and wagers are reported as being made at two to one, while m neighboring towns it ia thought that she will again escape, and many believe that she is capable and will take her own life before the hour of execution, and this assurance is somewhat due to her seeming indifference to her condi tion. The prison authorities feel that it will be impossible for sucn aJiappen ing, for every precaution is being made to prevent it. - Instead of being hysterical, as many resporters Btate, she s quite the reverse, especiallv since little Marguerite, the 5-ycar-oid daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Loukes, has been associated with her, as she loves children. This opportunity she makes the most of and delights in watching every movement made by the blue-eyed baby with golden curls, who either sits in her lap or plays on tne floor the greater part of the day, and when it is led from the room for the night she shows she regrets it. , There will be a rehearsal of the niins trel chorus for the Odd Ladies at the church basement Wednesday at 7.45 p, m.
