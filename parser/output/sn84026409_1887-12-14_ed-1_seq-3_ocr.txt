Tbk Republican National Committee Las decided that the presidential nomi nating Convention for 1S88 shall beheld t Chicago and has fixed on Tuesday, June 19th as the date on which the Con vention shall be held.

Bk a p the ticket 'did not read "for clerk of the Courts and recorder of deeds,' the Democratic candidate for Clerk of the Courts in Cumberland county has taken steps to contest the result with his sue cewful Republican competitor, who was elected by about ftti najority.

PswiiiKXTCif vela mi's Free-trade mes sage will be found on another agv of this paper. In more ways than one it is one of the most remarkable documents of the kind ever sent to an American Congress. It is short and confines itxelf strictly to the one topic that of reducing the public revenue. All other questions are excluded a of minor interest or im portance Of all the messages that have emanated from the White House there bus not been one wt ojienly out and out hostile to American capital and labor as this. Not one that has so decidedly at tacked the American system of manu factures. He would let the entire system of internal revenue stand and would reduce the surplus by a broad, w holcsale slaugh ter of the Protective duties. He declares that the internal taxes affect nothing lint iuxurii-a, and aims his whole blow at the tariff laws. He w ould place wool, iron ore, ooai and lumber on the free list and would greatly reduce if he did not alto getber abolish the duties on manufac tured articles that are imported and come into competition with our own American manufactures. The President has placed himself and party fairly and squarely on Free-trade and bravely throws down the yauge of battle. He is to be credited for bis courage in attacking Irotection and of inviting battle between American in dustry and its opponents, between the friends and the enemies of American manufacturea, between the policy of Pro tection and of absolute Free-trade. It very questionable whether the President will be able to carry with him a sufficient number of his party in Congress to secure legislation in acmrdance with his recom mendations. Should he do an it would possibly result in bis defeat for a re-nom-iuation. Hi message, in all human probability w ill secure the election of a Republican to be his successor.

Rlaie is a private citiaen, at pres ent travelinein Eurojie. The President of the United States after some months of incubation, delivers a stump speech on the tariff, in place of the annual message which bis official duty requires. Twenty four hours after its publication in this country there comes from Mr. BUine in Europe a reply so thoroughly Ans?rican in spirit, so keen in its comprehension of American interests and needs, so accurate in facts and so crushing and' complete in its argument, that leading papers of the party which support Mr. Cleveland do not dare to place it before their readers. His friends see that the reply will kindle the enthusiasm of millions of Americans fr the policy of the Republican party, and for the strong leader who so swiftly and surely represents American interests and A ulerican thought Mr. Cleveland's message not only divides and dismays his friends, but delights the London newspa pers and the British manufacturers. The fatal blunder of Mr. Cleveland was in attempting to make the people take it for granted that duties for the protection of home industry must be removed or lowered, in order, to diminish the reve nue. The people know better. Mr. Klaine, three thousand miles away, tells the President that taxes on tobacco and on spirits used in manufacturea can be cut off, and the tax on whiskey applied to the defense of seaports, and that it is simply inexcusable to retain internal war taxes for no better purpose than to de prive home ind wtries of the legitimate measure of defence which a tariff ade quate to raise the needed revenue would give. Coast defence, so ably and elo quently urged by Mr. Tilden, has never lieen fairly considered by Mr. Cleveland, and may easily be forgotten by a Presi dent w ho values British commendation, courts British favor, and considers Brit ish rather than American interest. lYotcction for home industries has not been directly awaited by any President expt Mr. Cleveland since Jauten Bu chanan went out of office in disgrace. It remains to be seen wln-ther President Cleveland can with safety rely upon tle influence of importing agent and foreign manufacturers, even in New York and New Jersey, to uphold him in trying to break down the tariff which has so grand ly developed and now defends American industry. .V.

Three ballots were required to determine the mat ter, but the victory of the Windy City when It was won was decisive. Jo we 19. liW, was determined as tlie diue. The committee met at the Arlington hotel. Chairman Jones, in calling the meeting to order, said : ' Gextlex k or tbc Committee: As sta ed in the call, this meeting is fbr the .pur poseof whs-ting a time and place for hold ing theiext Kejroblifwn National Conven tion ; also, to consider such oilier matter as may be brought before It," As everything connected, however re motely, with the government of this great country is important, our action to-day may have far-reaching results. We should, there fore, carefully consider such subjects as may be brought before us. that we may decide wisely." We may congratulate ourselves on the improved prospect of the Republican parry since the National Committee met in thia city four years ago for the same purpose that we are now assembled. At that time the majority against tlie Republican party in the North at the last preceding general ate elections counted up into the hundreds of thousands. The great States of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio had Democratic Governors. Sew York's waa elected by nearly 300,000 plurality, which wa reduced for the same candidate at the Presidential election to leas than, 1.100. " Though by accident tbe Democratic par ty have tlie Presidency and the prestige of success, the signs are auspicious for the elec tion of a Republican President in ls8. Tlie momentum acquired by 25 years of the prev alence of Republican principles has not yet lost its force, and the material interests of the country are still pnwiering as the result of Republican industrial lejpslagation. Re cent utterances, however, indicate a deter mination to end this pKnerity by adverse legislation forced nioii tbe country by an administration hostile to American indus try ; and also indicate the necessity of the return to power of the Republican party in tbe National Government so that American industry, wool growing and sugar raising, equally with iron making and textile pro duction, may have continued proarity, and the employes constant employment and continued good wages, such as American workmen should receive."

IXCK. The committee adjourned tc the r.Kims of the National Republican Ijeague, the claims of the various cities were heard and the vo ting began.'

Cincinnati 9, Minneapolis S, Omaha 4, Philadelphia 3, St. Louis 1. On the third ballot Chicago received 25, one more than a majority ; Cincinnati 13, Minneapolis s and Omalial. Subsequently this vote, on motion of Mr. Morey. of Lou siana, was made unanimous for Chii ago. Quite a long discussion followed a motion to admit six dclegat-t-!arKe from Dakato to the National Convention. This proosi tion was finally amended, and as adopted allows Dakota and Washington Territory each four contingent delegates in addition to tlie two tegalar delegates. T:ie dutirman and secretary of tbe committee were then instructed to prepare the call lor the conven tion. A request from tlie National Republi can League of Washington to be permitted to docamiin work in the Southern States under the direction of Natiotud Committee, was grunted. General Syplier, of the Lnurie, announced that with these instructions the League contemplated doing campaign work witli tariff documents in some of the South ern Statis, without a dollar's exjiemie to the National Committee. WORK INCHES ASP VICOIKI t. A. II. Gallahue, Chaimtan of the New York Workingmen's Municipal RcSrm League, was admitted to present the views of that party.

The Virginia Repub licans, tbe address declares, are tired of lieing treated by tbe Republican party not as a ssr relation but as an illegitimate con nection.

WHAT BLAINE SAYS. HI View on Cleveland' Extraor dinary Maaaac Rapoal the To bacco Tax but Lat That on Whiakey Ramain. . The Paris correspondent of the New York Tribvu cables a report to that paper, giving the views of Mr. Blaine on the President message. Mr. Biaine said to the TVAwm representa tive: I have been reading an abstract of tbe I'resident's message and have been especial ly interested in the comment of the London papers. Those papers all assume to declare the message is a free trade manifesto, and evidently are anticijwtiug an enlarged mar ket for english fabrics in the United Slates as a consequence of the President's racom niendations. Perhaps thai fact stamped tbe character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can." You don't mean actual free trade without duty ? " queried the reporter. ' No,'' replied Illaine. " Nor do the Lon don paiKTS mean that. They simply mean that the President has recommended what in the flitted States is known as a revenue tariff, rejecting the rotective feature as an object and not even permitting protection to result freely as an incident to revenue duties." " 1 do not know that I clearly comprehend that last point," said the reporter. "I mean," said Mr. Blaine, "that fbr the lira time in the history of the Cnited States tiie President recommends retaining the in ternal tax in order that the tariff may be fumed down even below the fair revenue standard. He recommends that the tax on IoIhicco be retained, and thus that many mil li.HiM annually shall be levied on a domestic product which would far better come from a tariff on foreign fabrii-s." I favor the repeal of the tobacco lax." said Mr. Klaine, " and I would ure that it be done nt once, even before the Christmas holi.biys. It would, in the first place, bring great relief to growers of tolmcco all over the country and would materially lessee the price if the article to consumers. Tobacco to millions of men is a necessity. The Pres ident calls it a luxury, but it is a luxury in no 'thcr sense than tea and coffee are luxu ries. Tue only excuse for such a tax is the actual necessity under which the govern ment fou id itself during the war and the year's immediately following. Toietain the tax now in order to destroy the protection which would incidentally flow from raising the same amount of money on foreign im ort is certainly a most extraordinary poli cy fi;r our government." ' would you advise tbe repeal of the wlo-key tax alsti, Mr. Blaine?" ' N il would not. Other eoni.lerdtioiis than those of financial administration are to U- tiiken in account with regard to wRiskey. Tl.fie is a moral aide to it. To chcaie!i the !-'. of whi'-ki-y is to increase the consump tion , iiormously. There wi u Id lie no sense in iirintr. the reform wrought bv high li-cei;-e ill other State it" the Nation:;! Govern-lni-;it neutralizes the good effect by making whiskey within the reach of every one nt Jit cents a gallon. Whiskey would be every V. here distilled if the surveillance of the gov ernment were withdrawn by the remission of the tax, and illicit sales could not then lie prevented even by a policy as rigorous and searching as that with which Russia pursues the Nihilist. It would destroy high license at once in all the States. Whiskey has done a vast deal of harm in tlie Vnited Slates. I would try to make it to do some good. I would use the tax to fortify our cities on the seaUwrd. In view of the powerful letter al dresseil to tbe Democratic party ntilbesub jst of fortification by the late Samuel J. Tiiden in IntA. I am amazed that no atten tion has been imid to tbe subject by tlie IVnioeratic administration." Further, Mr. Blaine informed the Tribmtt representative that he would maintain the tax on whiskey " so long as there was any whi.-key to tax, and when the National Gov ernment would have no use for the money I would divide the tax among the Federal Vnion with the sjieeilic object of lightening the tax on real estate. Tlie bouses and farms of the whole country pay too large a propor tion of the total taxes. If ultimately relief could be given in that direction it would in my judgment, be a wise and bcne6cent policy." " Presidential Nominations. Wasiiisotok, Dec 7: The President sent the following nominations to the Senate to day: Lucius y.

Senatorial courtsey." which has usually led to tbe compliment of a confirmation without reference lo a committee when a Senator or ex-Senator has been nominated to any otlier office, has never prevailed iu respect to nominations to positions of the bench of tlie Snpreme Court. The last case preceding that of Mr. Itnar was that of Mr. Conkling. who had been out wf tlie Senate a much shorter period than that of Mr. Lamar. Mr. Conkling' nomination was sent to the Judicary Committee and reported back. He was con tinned by tlie .Senate and then de clined tiie office. It is probable that the nominations sent to the Senate will not be formally laid before the body until tae com mitters are formed. M r.

They have neither amended the tariff nor made any honest effort to do so. Cincinnati Commercial Gazette. (Rep.): Tlie Republican party would reduce the revenue. Mr. Cleveland's recommendations, while attacking American industries, would in crease the revenue. Thus, while home labor would be impoverished, there would be an increase rattier than a reduction in the revenue. Louisville Courier Journal (Dem.) : To the party itself the President's message makes clear that in 1HKS it will he tariff reform or nothing. No words could have been spoken which will so effectually ecfcrelhe harmony which so many de-ire as the clear, bold, emphatic declaration of party principle and party purpose coming from the President. New York Tribune (Rep.) : Credit is due to the President for making tbe issue boldly and distinctly, so that no man ran hereafter claim, with a show of reason, that the the ories and aims of ultra opxinents of pro tection have not in him a nealous advocate. On the iasue thus presented, the people can not dcchle too soon, and upon their decision will largely depend their future prosperity. Philadelphia Year (Rep.) : Mr. Cleveland has fixed the position of his party, and there is no escaw from it. Few even of those who fully agree with him would have ventured as far as he has gone, but now that he has plunged into the abyss they must follow him. The small band of Democratic protec tionists are left stranded and homeless, but tlie Democratic tarty must go with the President . New York 'nm (Rep.): Upon the whole the message is a declaration in fav.or of tariff fbr revenue only, and as such it must be re garded. If Mr. Cleveland is to tie the nomiuee of the Democratic rty in 1484 tiie protection ami free-trade issue will be clearly drawn. His utterances are those of a free trtfler, his arguments are in the same line, and to put his pniioals into execut ion would ilesimy American, industry, turn our home market over to foreigners, and reduK tlie com pensat ion of those who labor for a liv ing. ' Anarchist Most'a Sentence. New York, Dec. 8. Johann Most, the Au arehist, who was convicted of misdemeanor, was arraigned in the Gene ral Seasions Court to-day. His counsel, Mr. Howe, argued for a new trial, contending that Most had not been convicted on any fair evidence, but that an unfair prejudice had been instilled into the case. Assistant District Attorney Nicoll said in reply that be hoped Judge Cowing would not subvert all precedents of law by reviewing the verdict. Judge Cowing said he would deny the mo tion. I Hit that he would grant a certificate to tbe Supreme Court In General Terra, when the whole case might be heard. When the Clerk of tbe Court asked Moat what be had to say why sentence should not be pronounced on him Most appealed to the Judge to use his discretion in setting aside the verdict and protested his innocence, say hht conviction had been brought about by perjury and prejudice. Judge Cow ing's only reply was: "The sentence of the Court is thai you be confined in the penitentiary ior a period of one year without the fine."- A Pistol in the French Deputies. Paxes, Dec. 10 M.

THRU IPCSTANT DECISIONS. Validity of the Prohibition Law In Kansas Affirmed. The first opinion was read by Justice Matthew. nd was concurred in by all the other JaMticea except Harlan., It sustains tlie position of the State of Virginia in what is familiarly known as the "coupon case." and reverses the position assumed toward Slate authorities by the Circuit Jud:e Bond, 'wis canned certain of them to be Imprisoned for disobeying a restraining order forbidding them lo bring uits fbr the collection if taxes in case where tenders have been made of tax receivable coupons cut from State bonds. The Supreme Court, in other words, now decides that the Federal power cannot be legally exercised to prevent the State of Virginia from po railing any course she may choose with regard to her State debt, which was a contract made, not by individuals with individuals, but by outside individuals with a State. The imprisoned officials are, therefore, discharged ; and the effect of the decision, in tlie second place, upon the debt question, will undoubtedly be to settle that question finally and forever. The English creditors will now probably accept the set tlement offered them by the last Legislature of Virginia, and thus end this vexatious matter. The other decision was of yet greater im portance, sustaining, as it did, the constitu tionality of the prohibitory law of Kansas. It will be remembered thai this was regarded as a test case, involving the right of a State or other community to pass laws calculated to break up an established business, like that of liquor selling. It was claimed on be half of the liquor interest, that in cases where liquor seller's business had been in terferred with by such laws, they were entitled to coniiensation, and that proh ibi tory laws were unconstitutional, because they abridged the liberty of the citizen and destroyed his property without due cause. The Court held that the right of determining w hat measures are necessary for the preserva tion of the public morals, health and salVty had therefore been vested in the States by the constitutional right given them under the police power to regulate their owu in ternal concerns. The State of Kansas had a right to prohibit the liquor traffic. It did not thereby take away tbe projierty of the brewers. It simply abated a nuisance. The property is not taken away from its owners ; they are only prohibited from nsing it for a specific purpose which the Legislature de clared to be injurious to the comunity. If the Supreme Court had sustained this claim it is hardly iiossihle to estimate the conse quence. The damages due to liquor sellers in State where prohibitory laws have been already enforced would have probably mount ed into hundreds of millions of dollars, in volving many communities and States in prospective bankruptcy ; the Prohibition party would have been given it coup de grace, and there would have been othei im portant and far-reaching consequences. Hut the Supreme Court, it apiwarc. decides the other way. It says Justices Harlan de livering the opinion that a State, in the exercise of its police power, has a right to suppress the liquor traffic, if it considers that tartttc subversive of public jieace or morality and that in that case the parlies whose busi ness is injured have no claim to damage or compensation. This will undoubtedly rank in future as a notable decision and prece dent. In the case of William H. Council colored vs. the Western i& Atlantic Railroad Com pany, llie inter-atatc commerce commission has decided that colored ieople may he aligned separate care on equal terms, with out disadvantage to either race, ami with i increased comfort to both ; that the car j furnish colored people, who buy first class j tickets, accommodations equally safe and I comfortable with other first-class assen gers. . Literally Roasted Alive. Whkeusu, W. V., Dec. 9. John Hagger ty, an emloye of the Wheeling Company's steel plant, met with an accident this morn ing which, while leaving him with slender hold uon life, was of the most horrible na ture. Haggerty is a shear man, and stepped too dose to a pair of rolls just as a white hot steel ingot had been passed between them. He was knocked, down and the ingot, from which little rivulets, of melted steel were tricking, slid across his body. Haggerty was mil noticed however, and the ingot was reversed and again passed through the rolls, resting as liefore upon the poor man's body. It was then that he was first seen, hut not until he had placed his naked hands against the hot metal, and attempted to push the ignot from him. Wlien removed the bones were sticking through the flesh, which was litterully fried and was banging from him in shreds. At his left knee, where the protruding bone come in contact with the ignot, it is burned lo a brown color. His death is a question of but a few hours. Another Plea for Weston. Habrihbcbc, l'a., lw 8.
