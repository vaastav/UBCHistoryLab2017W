TAKAHIRA IS FRANK Discusses Japanese Relations With America. PLEASED AT THE OUTLOOK I Gratified at Bond of Union Between the (Countries. MEANING OF LATE AGREEMENT ? Declares That It Was Merely a Heaffirmation of the Friendly Relations of the Two Nations. NEW YORK. December 19.?Comparing the recent joint declaration by Japan and the United States in regard to their respective policies in the Pacific to "a transaction between trusted friends," Baron Takahira, Japanese ambassador to the United States,, in an address tonight at the Lotus Club at a dinner given in his honor expressed in an unmistakable way his great gratification that so strong a bond of union between the two nations had been cemented. President Frank R. Lawrence, who acted as toastmaster, in Introducing the ambassador, referred to the recent understanding as a development to be welcomed from the American viewpoint as assuring a continuance of the amicable relations between the two countries and also their friendly rivalry In commerce. Baron Takahira expressed his appreciation of the compliment the club had paid him. Baron Takahira's Remarks. Continuing the baron said: "When I lived in this city many years ago," said Baron Takahira, "I used to go to the Harlem river for fishing, and I saw that the boatman always rowed hard when the tide was against him; in the same way I now see that the diplomat speaks much when his affairs are not in good shape. But, as things are now between the United States and Japan there is nothing to warrant much speechmaking. 1 fully believe I am not mistaken when I say that our relations are in the best possible condition. I think we may say there is now nothing more to be desired in the relations of our - two countries. But if the past is to serve as a lesson for the future it would be well to consider what we have bad to experience for these few years. "In these years, wo have to admit, we had such a terrible time in regard to our relations as we could never have anticipated. No doubt there were some undesirable Incidents occurring between some people of the two countries, but they were only local affairs and in no way to be regarded as menacing to onr traditional friendship. But too much importance was given to them in some quarters, and even a war clamor was allowed to be raised in spite of the sincere good will continually existing between the two governments. But, thanks to the sincerity of the friendship existing all the time between the two governments, no serious consequences were allowed to occur that might otherwise follow such circumstances. Reaffirmation of Friendship. "I took the opportunity at a dinner given in my honor on my arrival here some months ago to declare that there is no art in our game of diplomacy. In our international transactions I can most firmly repeat the same assertion and add that there Is no such word as 'dplomacy* as popularly defined. The declaration of the two governments recently made by the United States and Japan in rpcard to thpir resDeetive oollcv in China and the Pacific Is a good example. It is simply a reaffirmation of what was understood between them years ago, and there is practically nothing which was not hitherto declared between them. It is like a transaction between trusted friends. It requires no formality to legalize the instrument. "Still, when such declaration was made between the governments of great moral standing 4ike those of the United States and Japan it will undoubtedly liave an important effect, which, I think, is already beginning to be felt In many ways; and it is my sincere desire th^t the people of each country will have the same mind as their own government in trusting that of the other, and In doing so I ant convinced their rights will be fullyprotected and their interests largely advanced, to the mutual benefit of the two countries." Takahira's Rise Outlined. The menu for the dinner, faithfully Japanese in its decorations, outlined the rise of Baron Takahira in Japanese affairs and in the world of diplomacy. It took up his career in 1879, when he was secretary of the Japanese legation in Washington; 1891 finding him consul general to New York; 1894, promoted to minister to Italy; 1895, minister to Austria-Hungary; 1899, vice minister for foreign affairs in the emperor's cabinet; 1900. minister to the United States; 1905. one of the Portsmouth peace commissioners; 1907, ambassador to Italy, and last winter appointed ambassador to the United States. Among others who responded to toasts were Consul General Midzuno, Andrew Carnegie. Rear Admiral Goodrich, John S. Wise and James M. Beck. MR.

Post Office?Frank H. Hitchcock. Agriculture James Wilson. Commerce and I.ahor ? Ueorge A. Knight. CINCINNATI. Ohio. December 10.?A Times-Star special from Augusta. Ga., says: When Philander C. Knox, the Taft Secretary of State, comes to Augiu-ta to discubs with the next President the makeup of the remainder of the new administration cabinet, Mr. Taft will ask him to approve of Myron T. Herrick, former Governor of Ohio, as Secretary of the Treasury. This fact can be stated as coming from authentic sources. Before Mr. Taft offered the Treasury portfolio to Representative Theodore E. Burton of Ohio he was seriously considering Herrick for the place. Now Herrick Is the approved man for the Job. Roosevelt Men Eliminated. The selection of Knox as Secretary of State is of vast significance In that It will probably mean that moat of the men now in the cabinet who have figured as great Roosevelt supporters will lose out in the final framing of the personnel of the Taft cabinet. The President-elect is frank in his statement that he will depend on the counsel of Knox more than on the advice of any other man. This is taken to mean that the chances of Plnchot being Secretary of Agriculture and Garfield being Secretary of the Interloc -are reduced JUk^- minimum. Proposed Cabinet. When Mr. Knox arrives here within the ? ? ??' Taft will submit next weeK or av to him for his inspection and approval the following- cabinet list: Secretary of State?Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania. Secretary of the Treasury?Myron T. Herrick of Ohio. Attorney General?George W. Wickersham of New York. Secretary of War?Charles Magoon.

AUGUSTA, Ga.. December 19.?Directed as an answer to the numerous newspaper cabinet suggestions which have been made recently in many quarters, Mr. Taft said tonight that he had made no progress whatever in making up his cabinet aside from the Knox announcement. Admitting that nearly all of the names that have been suggested In the papers have also been suggested to him, and that in nearly all instances he thought well of the men, he insisted that he had reached no determination nor was there pending any offer of any position to any one. Sjnce his arrival here Mr. Taft said he had been free from active negotiation regarding hi^ cabinet; aside from the telegram he received yesterday from Senator Knox. In this connection he added that he had made no engagements for conferences on that or other subjects. Mr. Taft has as yet not written Senator Knox of his desire to see him here, nor has he heard from the senator other than the acceptance telegram. He made it plain ^ih r>nnmiit hie Sec yesterday mai uc ?i.vu.- ~ retary of State thoroughly before going further Into the cabinet-making business. Mr. Taft's Recreations. Mr. Taft indulged in golf today, and with Mrs. Taft and the boys was a member of a box party given in his honor by Mr. and Mrs. Thomas at a local theater here tonight. The announced appearance of the next President at the theater resulted in making the occasion one for an elaborate social demonstration as well as of popular interest on the part of Augustans. Mr. Taft has consented to be the guest of honor at a dinner to be given some time in the near future by the Country Club, on whose golf links he is to spend several hours daily during his stay in this city. Cruisers Placed at Taft's Disposal. Secretary Newberry of the Navy Department has sent word to Mr. Taft that the armored cruisers North Carolina and Montana will be placed at his disposal for the trip to the isthmus when Mr. Taft and Iiis party, which is to be composed ? ww of a number of engineers, go 10 x-&iinuia next month. The two cruisers are twenty-two-knot boats and capable of making the trip from Charleston or Savannah to the isthmus in four days. At either of these two ports Mr. Taft and his party will have to embark on the cruisers from a lighthouse tender or some other small vessel, as the two cruisers draw too much water to permit of taking them into port The North Carolina, which is commanded by ('apt.
