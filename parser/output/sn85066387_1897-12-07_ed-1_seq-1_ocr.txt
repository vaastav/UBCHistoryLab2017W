gfr VOLUME LXXXIII.-NO. 7. "EXAMINER" DETECTED FORGING A DISPATCH FROM CAPTAIN TUTTLE MRS. FRANCIS TUTTLE SHOWS HOW "THE EXAMINER" FALSIFIED THE TELEGRAM SENT BY HER HUSBAND. Not satisfied with employing and train- | me petty larcenies to gain entrance to The Call pressroom under false preten ses, for the purpose of stealing early sheets of publication from which the j news it has no: the enterprise to secure i could be stolen, the Examiner has at last brazenly taken to the open as a fais fier and forger. The Examiner stands so plainly in dicted and condemned on the face of the evidence for forgery and mendacity that the shameless ingenuity on which its notoriety is founded cannot avail in its defense. Since the movement The Call, prompt el by humane considerations, s-et in mo tion the wheels of government and offered tne fullest aid that money could extend yio speed to the ice floes of the Arctic an Pition proper.}' equipped for the ef end rescue of the unfortun e whaler?, the Examiner has fairly ssed itself in cheapness of ' and effrontery, for the purpose of advertisement out of the expedi- j 'radically, when ail had been i aiv» d, when the Government assign ments had been agreed upon ant the inci dental expenses of equipment guaranteed without ostentation and without request for that contributory "assistance" from tna public purse for which tt.e Examiner has such an itching palm. Under every sort of charitable pretext it started a ;und at the head of which it pledge;! $1500, and drew on its private snap baseball iuna for a similar amount. Here the effort of its pyrotechnic sympathy ended. The pub lic saw through the advertising ruse and declined to be baited. Not to be accused of bad faun, and to make it - bluster as effect as possible, •he Examiner purchased out of its trivial munificence and sen!. to Seattle, for the crew of the Bear, what was advertized, in the accustomel manner of nauseating self-praise, as complete equipment for the men. The latter upon receiving the consign ment found it inadequate and disappoint ing to such a degree that they complained openly, and insisted on outfitting their - S selves; a necessity that caused the Bear 1 to iay to an additional day.  Naturally, the news of this ridiculous development as to the vastly vaunted ' 'Vnero.Mty of the Examiner escaped from l \a forec «ile of the Bear and found its T l to the outer world, which the Exam * Ante r» Jed to deceive. \,his situation, confronted publicly :.< • ' \k Oi i'« paltry meanness, and JOl, y; Is with the guffaws it de ~ tf f'^jaminer did not hesitate to • a Jr' cc alike dishonorable and 54 fo jgir ~ c .«iy -preface the charge further? /pt-* . jf/&. Frank Tuttle, wife of the com mander of the Bear, tell the facts. She is at her home at 1004 Market street, Oak land. She said to a reporter for The Call yesterday: "I was coming from Seattle when I saw tli« false statement in the Examiner with my Lu-iban in signature beneath it. I was '•-> indignant I could not sit still, and as soon as I got to Oakland I wrote to The Call correspondent at Seattle, who is a perfect gentleman, and told him the truth, i did this out of justice to Captain Tuttle j and Mr. Spreckels. "My husband is an officer and a gentle man and is graietul to the public for what ■ •as been done for the Bear. It is shame ful to make it appear that he was guilty of gross disrespect at a time when he had ailed away and could not say a word in / is own behalf. \ "If anybody doubts the truth of ray 1 •-merit, that Captain Tuttle did not B \m any portion of the statement except r -iut I have underlined, I will make an oath to the effect that the last sentence in which Mr. Jbpreckels' name is used is a lie." Airs. Tuttle took a copy of the state ment in the Examiner and underlined the portion that her husband signed, wnic*i appears above as an exhibit. "Not one word did he utter or sign," she continued, "that I h&vo not underlined. I The San Francisco Call CAPTAIN TUTTLE'S WIFE DENOUNCES A FORGERY SEATTLE, Dec. 6. — The following self-explanatory letter came t^rou^h the mail and was delivered to rue this morning: \'ICO4 Market Street, Oakland, Dec. 3, 1897. 'My Dear Mr Steel : On the train yesterday I bought an Examiner to while away the time, and was astounded to see the inclosed article with Captain Turtle's name signed to it. "I Mas present at the interview on hoard the Rear -when the first part of this article was written. The word* I have underlined Mere the captain's word**, in response to a request made by Mr. Todd, that he should pronounce the rroods sent oy the Examiner of good quality. He never mentioned the words, 'Spreckels' paper,' etc. "A» each newspaper has treated him courteously, he has thanked them both Id a courteous manner. It is beneath his dignity as an officer and a gentlemen to have made any sucb remark as published. "This statement was published the day after he sailed, which makes it all the worse. 1 do not wish to appear in any public way, but can take my oath that the underlined word* were Captain TiiHlcN; the remainder of the article was added after he had signed hi* name. "Unless it is immediately corrected and published as he pave it to Mr. Todd I will go to the office of 'I'llK 

CALL, and the Examiner also if necessary, and denounce it a* a forgrery." "You are at liberty to show this letter and inclosure to Mr. Todd. He has always treated the Captain in a gentlemanly manner, and I am sure fie will immediately correct the words that must hare been added after the article had left his hands. "1 am sincerely yours, The inciosure referred to by Mrs. Tuttle is a capping from the San Francisro Examiner of November 30, and purports to be a telegram dated November 25, and sent by Captain Tuttie. Tht worts underlined are a« follows: •'I have seen the clothing and I regard it as peculiarly suited for the rigors of the Arctic climate. The men of the Bear could not have criti cized it, for the reason that they have not seen the articles and will not have such an opportunity until the ship puts to sea." That part which Mr?. Tuttle declaresa forgery then follows and reads: •'Any statement that Sprocket** paper may have made to the effect that the llxaini ncrs {rood* are not good cla*« and up to every requirement of the oc casion i- not founded on fact." W. A. Steel. >nnnnoOOOOO00OO0O0000000nnnnnnnnmn««.»...-- 1 w s standing by him aboard the Bear when the interview took place, and was looking over his shoulder when he signed the words, and I know positively just what he said. "I was with him nearly all the time he was at Seattle, and every minute of tho time after the interview quoted until he sailed, and this particular instance I te j member very vividly. ''The Examiner correspondent acted in a very pleasant manner, and impressed me as being a genileman, and I believe that the portion of the interview referrin ■ to Kpreckels' paper was added after the dispatch reached San Francisco. "I am very much opposed to publicity, but I will not have my busband place i in a false position by anybody, especially | during his absence. Neither will 1 ba | silent while a lalse statement ap- j j pears with Captain Tuttle's aitnature j apeakinu disrespectfully of Mr. Spreckels lor The Call. It is very unpleasant for j me to say anything at all, but it is ■imply j from a sen-e nf duty tint I do so." RICH SI h IKE ON DOG CREEK.

Riggs HotrsE ) Washington, Dec. 6. f At noon to-day the tirst session of < lie Fifty-fifth Congress was' be^un. Simul taneously at both ends of tho Capitol- Speaker Reel in the Hou-e and Vice- President Hobart in the Senate — dropped their gavels and called to order the re spective bodies over which they preside. Tlie ceremony attending the opening ol a Congress, tbougn comparatively of a routine character and unusually devoid of interest except for the formal promulga tion of policies as outlined in the Presi dent's annual message, is a specttcle which in some respects Is regarded as the greatest official event of the year at the national capital. To-day the weather was propitious The »un shone brilliantly from a c oudle '»»■ sky, making a gloriou*. bright December day, with a tinge of frost in the air and a breeze just strong enough to keep the stars and stripes snapping from a flagstaff. Long before the hour for th« assembling of Congress crowds began wending their way to the Capitol, where they swarmel into the corridors and choked the marble stairways leading to the galleries As is v ual on such occasion* the reserve gal leries were guarded carefully in both the House and Senate sides, admission being only by card, and the general public had great difficulty in wedging itself into the limited space set aside for it. The attendance upon the session of the Senate, both on the floor and in the gal leries, was notably large, despite the well understood fact that litt a business be yond the presentation of the President's message and the proceedings incident thereto would be transacted. Prior to the convening of the Senate tne members passed half an hour in exchanging greet ings. Mr.|Hanna of Ohio, who bad been ill for a week, and Mr. Wolcon of Colorado, one of the members of the International Mon etary Commission, received especial at tention from their colleagues. Dr. W. Godfrey Hunter of Kentucky, recently ap pointed Minister to Guatemala, was an interested spectator of tne proceedings from a &eat beside his friend, Senator De bo* The openiug day of the regular se sion in the House passed without unusual in cident of any character. The formalities attending the inauguration of the session were dry and the spectacle hardly repaid the crowds which thronged the public and private galleries, yet, with fjw exceptions, the visitors sat through the proceedings. Both houses adjourned uutil to-morrow after the reading of the President's mes sage. ; -'.V 3--' 

OPENING OF THE SENATE. Beautiful Floral Tributes Adorn Desks and Membars Take Deep Interest In th 9 Mess g i. WASHINGTON, Die. 6.— The attend ance upon the lira session of the Senate to-day was notably large, de.ipite the well-understood fact tnat little business WILLIAM McKINLEY. THE MESSAGE IN BRIEF. The message of President MrKinley to Congress assumes properly that the extra session settled the tariff question, and takes up the cur rency as the next important national matter to be disposed of. The President recommends the estoppal of the endless chain by which the gold reserve is depleted by holding treasury notes paid into the treasury for gold until gold is paid for them by intending purchasers. He ap proves, also, the plan of Secretary Gage that national banks be allowed to issue circulating notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposited, and that the tax on circulating notes be reduced to one half of i per cent per annum. The President believes Spain is in earnest in the desire to pacify Cuba without iurther resort to the methods of the dark ages, and would withhold recognition of belligerency until the new Spanish Ministry can be proven. The larger part of the message is devoted to the discussion of the Cuban affair. He regards the annexation of Hawaii as the logical sequence of the present condition, but admits that there are in the islands' population elements not altogether fitted to share the duties and responsibilities of American citizenship. He touches upon existing complications in Central America in their bearing on the Nicaragua Canal. While he regrets the partial failure of the VValcott commission Id The interest of international bimetallism, yet he sees reason for felicitation in the friendly attituJe toward silver assumed by France. He would foster trade with all nations by reciprocal agreement and u^es upon Congress the necessity for earnest work in the rehabilitation of the American merchant marine. The preservation of the herd of fur-bearing seals is most earnestly advocated. Arbitration as a means for the settlement of disputes between na tions finds the same strong favor as under the Cleveland administra tion. The importance cf a proper showing at the Paris Exposition of 1900 is set forth at some length. The President is an earnest advocate of a strong naval programme, and would build large dry docks, in addition to those already in exist ence, on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and construct an additional battle-ship at once on the Western seaboard. The necessity for more strict governmental supervision of Alaska is pointed our. The President urges, also, the duty of the nation to extend help, should help be needed, to the miners in the Yukon Valley. It is de?med wise, for the nation's good, to make land-holding cl'i zens of the live civilized tribes in the Indian Territory. The need for a better system of quarantine, emphasized by the late yellow-fever epidemic, is pointed out The President asserts the purpose of the Government to buy the Kansas Pacific in case no bidder shall cover its lien, and asks express authority from Congress to take such action. The fact of the completion of the new National Library is recorded The success of civil-service reform is said to be assured and the purpose of the administration to adhere to the merit system is most em phatically asserted. beyond the presentation of the Presi dent's message and the proceedings th relo would be transacted.
