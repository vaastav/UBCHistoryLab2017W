State« aaye: "Tbe amount ;mid in pensions by tbe United Btates government during tbe mon lb of November was over $22,000,000. Probably tbe odd $2,000,000 went to deserving parties." It is estimated that tbe South has enongb pine timber yet standing to make 25,000 piles, with 1,000,000 feet in each pile. Tbe pine alone at $10 a thousand, is nearly as much as tbe assessed value of all oilier property. The Cleveland Plain Dealer says: "When Harrison attempts to carry out tbe pledges of tbe Republican platform, tbe masses of RepnbJicsn office-seekers snd tbe men who made it will say we only meant it in a Pick wickian sense." TnE New York Herald says: "Tbe Southerners lost the election, hut they have a big cotton crop, which miti gates the disaster. You can't have everything yoii want in the world, but the fellow who has a pile of cotton bales bas his full •bare.'' Tbe average number of pieces of mail matter sent during tbe year, foi every individual in the countries named, is, according to tbe postmas ter-general as follows: United States, pieces per capita, 71; Great Britain, 61; Germany, 41; France, 37. The United States supreme court rendered an important decision this week in regard to life insurance policies. Tbe court holds that a policy made payable to a man's wife or children can, under no circum stances, be attached by tbe creditors of the deceased. Last Friday was an unlucky day on the Illinois (Central railroad in Mississippi. Mr. Varnade was asaasi nated in Osykn; Mr. Marselas had both legs cut off in Magnolia; Tom. Com was mangled by a train between Summit and McComb City, and a conductor was killed at Cauton. The Crowley Signal says Eld. T. B. Harrell has moved to that place with his family, and will hold services on alternate Sundays at Rayne, Crow Icy Jennings and Welsh. Services will be held here at 7 o'clock p. in. on the second Sunday in December, and at Rayne at 11 o'clock a. m. on the same day. Senator Kesna, of West Virginia, has telegraphed to Washington that tbe legislature of that State is certainly Democratic, which insures a Demo cratic senator. Members of Congress are collecting slowly for the coming session. It is not thought that the Republicans of the Senate will try to pass their tariff hill this winter. The St. Paul Pioneer Free« says: "We know now that there will be a score or more of contests in the Forty first House. It is over a year before that House assembles, unless called together in extra session. If con tests were brought before a conrt the whole evidence could be heard and a report prepared for action by tbe day that Congress meets." '•It The Detroit AVer Prut says: is reassuring to the friends of civil service reform to he told, as they arc every day, that the President-elect ia better than hie party, and that the spoilsmen cannot control him. But it ia a little remarkable that there should he need of such assurance. It speaks ill for the party pf moral ideas tbatiu successful candidate has to be praised at its expense." A Wasbisötoe correspondent says •T have been bunting ever since Harrison was known to he elected, for « Washington Republican who does not expect to hold office under tbe next administration. He has not yet been found, aud it seem« unlikely that Im ever will he.

A gnat deal of it is ques tion* presented by tbe various depart neats. He reviews our foreign rein urns at length, more especially tbe Canadian affaire. Tn noting tbe fact that this is tbe one hundredth anniversary of the adoption of tbe Federal CoMtitnlion be reviews tbe condition of the coon try and points out many of the dan gers that threaten institutions and warns the people. It ie thought be takes a rather gloomy view of tbe situation, as liis propositions hereto fore in tbe main bare been disre garded. His warning at any rate ia timely, and be shows dangers Ahead À which we cannot deny, and dangers, too, that should be avoided. Tbe bil terneae between cupiLal and labor, tbe great power wielded by the truste, tin growing disposition to seek aid of tbe government for private enterprises and tbe interferancc in local affairs. He claims these as existing evils that are draining tbe life blood of the nation. He thinks trie most of these evils can be avoided by a reduction in tbe revenue and a reduction in tariff rates. If less money were taken from tbe people they would ask for leas from tbe government. If there was only a small surplus lying idle in the treasury there would be little disposition to appeal to the government for aid, and there would be less appropriation« for trusts and monopolies. He strongly backs up his former tariff message, showing clearly he has not changed his views on the subject conséquence- of defeat. It is con ceded by all that a reduction of rev enues if necessary, and they shonld be «ore that the benefit to our citizens be well considered, and that no scheme accepted bv which the burdens of the people are only apparently relieved. Mr. Cleveland brings the tariff ques lion before the people his last time and leaves it for them to settle. The Iberville South gives this good advice: "Let our people lend their energies to the development of our section, and by this we mean tbe improvement of our lands, our fences, our buildings and our stock generally, ud in a few years our parish will present an appearance of material progress unknown to it in ante bellum days. When the farmer produces more than iß sufficient to supply his family with the comforts that civili zation lias made indispensable to man, has Created a surplus for himself which can be applied to tbe impiove ment of tbe farm. Such a man is self sustaining, and it is only a ques tion of lime when be will amass enough of thin world's gooda to be considered ' well off" and independ Every farmer in this parish who cultivates industriously and intelli gently hau no need of the money lender. Our lands are rich and yield a plentiful harvest to tbe husbandman properly treated. At the risk of being considered monotonous, we again say that tbe cutting up of large and unproductive estates is a matter of necessity. It is no o»e to talk about inviting immigrants from other Slate« to our Slate if you have no inducements to bold out to them. Tbe planter has the inducements to hold out if he only gets out of the ! "old rate." Let him divide his plan- ' talion into lots of forty or sixty acres and well every alternate lot to immi grants at a fair price; that ib the way enhance the value of lands and to build op a country with desirable in habitants." XU.- Lmhi of Trmlr to l.aUe VkarlM. The Echo has from time to time called attention to the necessity of a good public highway leading north of town, aud tree ferriage in order to obtain tbe immense trade of the parish that naturally belongs to this point, and would come boro if properly en coo raged, it is not alone the mer chants of Lake Charles that want this trade, nod would be benefitted by it, but every farmer living in the north part of the pariah should be equally interested. The loss of this trade is felt by every man, either directly or indirectly. A trade of at least 8200,000 should come to Lake Charles that goes to other points outside tbe parish. In a conversation with Mr. Erwin Perkins, who runs a ferry on the Calcasieu river, says that last year, up to this he had crossed 370 wagons, and this fall he hod crossed ten. This is certainly enough to convince any one moat be done to eeonre a return of this trade and more. The farming oommunity and the merobi of Lake Charles shonld see to it that good roads and free ferriage be given them. This is the only way it will ever be done. Tbe ootton crop of this parish should come to this point, and the merchants should organise a company and build » compress and warehouse, so that it can be handled with as little expense as possible. Citizens of Lake Charles and Caioa aieu parish, wake np to your interest and go to work and make this what QotMmtAoi it-the garden .pot of Ughls a»«* Uiadews.

Mr. William* usée a tacky bit in »«ariug r he sot , The Roston Caiagrapl says: "A Methodist minister by tbe name of C. M. Verde!I, while on his way from Texas to North Georgia, was arrested in Monroe by tbe police of that town on Tuesday night of last week and imprisoned in the town prison until the following morning before be was released. He was arrested under the «opposition that he was the man Bunch who robbed the express car on the Northwestern railroad «boot the first of this month. Monroe is un fortunate in its record of happenings of mistaken identity. Four years ago Gen. King bad the same experience in that town while passing through on his way to tbe hills this aide, but the general was too sharp to be shot up in tbe lock-up all night. Mavbe the Monroe police will some day learn tbe i difference between a Congressman or Methodist preacher and a train ; robber." the h ment, The Brooklyn Eagle says: "De manch for 'a clean sweep' will uot cease, bat there will not be any more 'clean sweeps' in national adminis . tralions. President Cleveland ^ re tention of specialiv competent Repnb licans, bap set an example, which Gen. Harrison will have to follow, in the retention of specially competent Dem* ocrats. In its letter and spirit civii service reform has come to stay. There is going to be more of it instead of less of it. President Cleveland has j made that certain, lie has rendered resistance to spoilsmen easier for ail a his successors, because Ins own was in j a tbe main so resolute. Doubtless if he j has any regret at all now, it is on account of any degree to winch be has let the spoilsmen bend him from c , , - r . f his clear shining sense of right. _^__ ; Coxoressman Oates. of Alabama, | who has given a good deal of careful study to the prospective policy of General Harrison towards the South, ! says: "It is probable that Harrison j d will uodertake to disintegatc the j present parties in the South bv giving ■ federal offices to week-kneed Demo craU and Protectionism, thereby j furnishing to the negro voters more j respectable white leaders than they J have had heretofore. He will find j auch Democrat« in every State for ! sale, but the number will depend very largely upon the social status of the j first converts to hi» policy and service are allowed to retain."

They can keep none of those promisee. The campaign itself was one vast falsehood from begin ning to end. Now, therefore, that the day of redemption is at hand, what The Pittsburg Pinputch says: "It might, perhaps, be urged in stronger language that the men who contribute money to buy votes, either in this way or in tbe retail line, not only de serve to lose their money, but need to cultivate a brief, but striking acquaint ance with the criminal law. Themen who furnish the money to he poured without discrimination into cam paigns, are responsible, if corrupt politicsns and floating strikers make a big haul at the funds." Sknatok Allison Buys: "If the Republicans have n majority in the next House, which seems probable, they will pass a bill in the next Coo ls if uoue is passed this winter. Republicans recognise the necessity for a reduction in tbe revenue and also the ueaeasity oi tariff revision. If they have both housse, tbe tariff will he revised and the revenue rednoed practically upon tbe general plan pro posed in tbe Senate substitute." a The Republicans in the departuien ta at Washington «bo bave been «lie loudest »boulets for a non-partisan civil service »oder tbe present admin istration, arc no« vigorously clamor ing for a "clean sweep" after tbe 4 th ol Mardi- Suoh is tbo prioe of keep ing these fellow* in oflioe years after they should bave been discharged When the Democratic party gets cop trel Of the government again it will «Bow Habrisof's Southern policy con tint!« to be a subject of general dis cussion bare. Tbe opinion is almost unanimous among the members of both parti« that Harrison's administration will he a very conservative one unless something now entirely unexpected should occur. We don't think tbe South has anything to fear at the bands of Harrison. If many things that now have a somewhat trouble some look are let severely alone, tb«*\ will adjust themselves. Chief among this chun of things i6 the negro ques tion. We are certain, from mfoiroa tion received from Republican sources, that Harrison will appoint no negro to any prominent federal office in th Booth. In fact there is an undoubted disposition among Republicans tc> relegate the negro to back seats in future He is no longer of an\ practical use to that partv. therefore they W *U give him nothing. The clerks in the Government de part ment« in Washington City below the grade of chief, are al! in an eas\ state of mind just at present. The) have become convinced that Harrisoi. ie a genuine civil service reformer, and that there wil! be no clean sweej when he comes in. The principal cause of this belief was an articie in our local papers, taker from the ed> torial columns of tbe Indianapolis Journal, a paper which is thought to be Harrison's home organ, which warned the Republicans not to expect a ''clean sweep." There may not be a clean sweep, but in our opinion a' the close of Harrison's term there will not be one Democrat in office for each ten ^publican* uov drawing Uncle c , , ,, bam s pav. In other words, we don t f - believe that Harrison will keep one tenth as many Democrats in office as r Cleveland has kept Republicans. —---- " 1 On tbe eve of the first Thanksgivinc d «^ a '^r Secretary Whitney look charge of the Navy Department, he inaugurated the pretty custom of pre '»outing each one of the four hundred employes of that department with a big fat turkey The custom has been regularly kept up ever since, and last Wednesday the employes of that de partaient received for the last time Ibia practical evidence of the Sec-re - tary h interest in their welfare.

Robin son, was wounded badly, having re ceived several rifle »hols in his body. Tbe 4jhots were all fired by Gelte BJoani 1 , our town marshal, and we understand the trouble grew out of sonic old family feud The Robin sons were first cousins of Bloane, and the parties were all between the ages of 20 and 30 years of age, and were all raised in this vieinity. Tbe wounded man was cared for by Drs. Webb and January, and he will probably get well. The dead man leaves a wife and one child to mourn his loss. Sloane was taken in charge by Sheriff Lyons.
