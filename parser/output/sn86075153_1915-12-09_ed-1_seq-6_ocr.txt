President Wilson's Message Continued) fuel 'ships, 4 transports. ?> tenders to torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. But armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be con sidered if we are to consider the su preme matter of national self sufficien cy and security in all its aspects There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not There is, for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping involved in this great problem of national adequacy It is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national efficiency and devel opment that we should have a great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once used to make us rich that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag into every sea and who were the pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our commercial independence on the seas. With a view to meeting these press ing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves at the earliest possi ble moment of the present unparalleled opportunity of linking the two Ameri cas together in bonds of mutual inter est and service, an opportunity which may never return again if we miss it now, proposals will be made to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the government similar to those made to the last congress, but modified in some essential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed since the former pro posals were made has made the ne cessity for such action more and more manifestly imperative. That need was then foreseen. It is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. 1 am not so much interested in the par ticulars of the program as I am in taking immediate advantage of the great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act in this emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevail, and out of it should come an early solo tlon of this pressing problem. 

SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES. Reoommends Early Adoption of M*as urea Giving Tham Fuller Justice. The president recommends the early adoption of bills for the alteration and reform of the government of the Phil ippines and for rendering fuller polit ical Justice to the people of Porto Rico, which were submitted to the Sixty third congress. The president refers to the increased cost of carrying out the plans for the armed forces of the nation and tells of the fiscal problems confronting the government On the 30th of June last there was an available balance in the general fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78. The total estimated receipts for the year 191G, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by the last congress will not be extended beyond its present limit, the 31st of December, 1915, and that the present duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after the 1st of May. 1916, will be $670,365,500. The balance of June last and these estimated rev enues come therefore to a grand total of $774,535,605.78. The total estimated disbursements for the present fiscal year, including twenty-five millions for the Panama canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations and $50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp tlons, will be $753,891,000, and the bal ance in the general fund of the treas ury will be reduced to $20,044.605.78. The emergency revenue act If contin ued beyond its present time limitation would produce during the half year then remaining about forty-one mil lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar if continued would produce during the two months of the fiscal year remaining after the 1st of May about fifteen millions. These two sums, amounting together to fifty-six mil lions, if added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury at the end of the year an available balance of $76.044, 605.7a The additional revenues required to carry out the program of military and naval preparation of which I have spoken would, as at present estimated, be for the fiscal year 1917 $93,800,000 Those figures, taken with the figures for the present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose our finan cial problem for the year 1917. As suming that the taxes Imposed by the emergency revenue act and the pres ent duty on sugar are to be discontin ued and that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year will be only $20,644,605.78, that the disbursements for the Panama canal will again be about $25.000,000 and that the addi tional expenditures for the army and navy are authorized by the congress, the deficit in the general fund of the treasury on the 30th of June. 1917. will be nearly $235.000.000. To this sum at least $50.000.000 should be add ed to represent a safe working balance for the treasury and $12.000.000 to In clude the usual deficiency estimates in 1917, and these additions would make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If the present taxes should be continued throughout this year and the next, however, there would be a balance in the treasury of some $76,500,000 at the end of the present fiscal year and a deficit at the end of the next year of only some $50,000,000. or, reckoning in ______ . y. . ____1. I $62,000.000 for deficiency appropria tions and a safe treasury balance at the end of the year, a total deficit of some $112,000,000. The obvious moral of the figures is that it is a plain conn sei of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or their equivalents and confine ourselves to the problem of I providing $112,000,000 of new revenue 1 rather than $297,000,000. How shall we obtain the new rev enue? We are frequently reminded that there are many millions of bonds which the treasury is authorized under existing law to sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the construction of the Panama canal, and it is true that bonds for the amount of $222,432,000 are now avail able for that purpose. Prior to 1913 $138,000,000 of these bonds had ac tually been sold to recoup the expendi tures at the Isthmus, and now con stitute a considerable item of the pub lic debt But I for one do not believe that the people of this country approve of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing money is shortsight ed finance. It can be Justified only when permanent things are to be ac complished which many generations will certainly benefit by and which it seems hardly fair that a single genera tion should pay for. The objects we are now proposing to spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be done in the interest of posterity as well as in our own. It seems to me a clear dictate of pru dent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are now, I hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the country are entitled to know just what burdens of taxation they are to carry and to know from the outset now. The new bills should be paid by internal taxation. 

NATION'S SECRET FOES SHOULD BE CRUSHED. Gravest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Own Borders. The president says that the precise reckonings of the problem to be met are set forth in the report of the secre tary of the treasury. I have spoken to you today, gentle men, upon a single theme, the thor ough preparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of entire freedom to play the impar tial role in this hemisphere and in the world which we all believe to have been providentially assigned to it I have had in my mind no thought of any immediate or particular danger arising out of our relations with other rations. We are at peace with all the nations of the world, and there is rea son to hope that no question in con troversy between this and other gov ernments will lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy have been and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags, but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of Amer ica, who have poured the poison of dis loyalty into the very arteries of our national life, who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive pur poses to strike at them and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign in trigue. Their number is not great as compared with the whole number of those sturdy hosts by which our na tion has been enriched in recent gen erations out of virile foreign stocks, but it is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it necessary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we may be purged of their orrupt distempers. America never witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed it possible that men sworn into its own citizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as supplied some of the best and strongest elements of that little, but how heroic, nation that in a high day of old staked its very life to free Itself from every entanglement that had darkened the fortunes of the older nations and set up a new stand ard hereâ€”that men of such origins and such free choices of allegiance would ever turn in malign reaction against the government and people who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud country once more hotbed of European passion. A lit tle while ago such a thing would have seemed Incredible. Because it was in credible we made no preparation for it We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for it, as if we were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! But the ugly and incredible thing has actually come about, and we are without adequate federal laws to deal with it I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self respect of the nation. Such creatures of pas sion. disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out They are not many, but they are Infinitely malignant and the band of our power should close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality I of the government, they have sought to pry into every confidential trans [ action of the government in order to serve Interests alien to our own. It is possible to deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with. I wish that it could be said that only a few men, misled by mistaken send I m n 1 IaivIaTIAA tho (VAtYOM WtAnffi ments of allegiance to the governments under which they were born, had been guilty of disturbing thyself possession and misrepresenting the temper and principles of the country during these days of terrible war, when it would seem that every man who was truly an I American would instinctively make it bis duty and his pride to keep the 1 scales of judgment even and prove him self a partisan of no nation but his own* But it cannot There are some men among us and many resident abroad who, though born and bred in the United States and calling them selves Americans, have so forgotten themselves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate sympathy with one or the other side in the great European conflict above their regard for the peace and dignity of the United States. They also preach and practice disloyalty. No laws, 1 suppose, can reach corruptions of the mind and heart, but I should not speak of others without also speaking of these and ex pressing the even deeper humiliation and scorn which every self possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel when he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily bringing upon us. What Is more Important is that the industries and resources of the country should be available and ready for mobilization. It is the more impera tively necessary, therefore, that we should promptly devise means for do ing what we have not yet doneâ€”that we should give intelligent federal aid and stimulation to industrial and voca tional education, as we have long done In the large field of our agricultural industry; that at the same time that we safeguard and conserve the natural resources of the country we should put them at the disposal of those who will use them promptly and intelli gently, as was sought to be done in the admirable bills submitted to the last congress from its committees on the public lands, bills which I earnest ly recommend in principle to your con sideration; that we should put into early operation some provision for rural credits which will add to the ex tensive borrowing facilities already afforded the farmer by the reserve bank act adequate instrumentalities by which long credits may be obtained on land mortgages and that we should study more carefully than they have hitherto been studied the right adapta tion of our economic arrangements to changing conditions. Many conditions about which we have repeatedly legislated are being altered from decade to decade, it is evident, under our very eyes and are likely to change even more rapidly and more radically in the days imme diately ahead of us when peace has returned to the world and the nations of Europe once more take up their tasks of commerce and industry with the energy of those who must bestir themselves to build anew. 

REGULATIONS TO MEET RAILROAD PROBLEM. Needed to Make Lima More Ueeful Servants of Country. In the meantime may I make this suggestion? The transportation prob lem is an exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has from time to time of late been rea son to fear that our railroads would not much longer be able to cope with it successfully, as at present equipped and co-ordinated. I suggest that it would be wise to provide for a com mission of Inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole ques tion whether our laws as at present framed and administered are as serv iceable as they might be in the solu tion of the problem. It is obviously a problem that lies at the very foun dation of our efficiency as a people. Such an inquiry ought to draw out every circumstance and opinion worth considering, and we need to know all sides of the matter if we mean to do anything in the field of federal leg islation. No one, 1 am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The regula tion of the railways of the country by federal commission has had admirable results and has fully Justified the hopes and expectations of those by whom the policy of regulation was originally proposed. The question Is not. What should we undo? It is whether there is anything else we can do that would supply us with effective means, in the very process of regu lation, for bettering the conditions un der which the railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole. It seems to me that it might be the part of wisdom, therefore, before further legislation in this field is attempted, to look at the whole problem of co-or dination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion, as a guide to dealing with the several parts of it: For what we are seeking now. what in my mind Is the Bingle thought of this message, is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation. We should serve it in the spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of common men for self government, in dustry. justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that it lacks no in strument, no facility or vigor of law, to make it sufficient to play its part with energy, safety and assured suc cess. In this we are no partisans but heralds and prophets of a new age. is

OVERLAND AUTO FACTORY INTRODUCES SMALL CAR R. A. Doty, manager of the Glen dive branch of the Lahr Motor Sales company of Bismarck, N. D., an nounces the receipt yesterday of the first two of the latest product of the big Overland automobile factory, 4-cylinder, 5-passenger touring car of light weight selling for $615, F. O. B factory. The new car is designed aft er the large Overland models and has electric lights, self starter, 4-inch tires and cantilever springs. The tonneau is large and roomy and it is complete ly equipped with all the latest de vices. The new car is said to have been designed to meet a condition, as it is a fine looking complete automobile at a medium price. Many of the parts are exactly the same as on the larger Overland models, and the low price is maintained because of the enormous production of the factory, which is now 600 cars per day and which is expected to reach 1000 daily by the first of June next year. NEARLY ALL THE TAXES ALREADY COLLECTED From incomplete figures of the amount of taxes already collected from the tax-payers of the county by the county treasurer, it is seen that more than 90 per cent of the total as sessment of $418,000.00 has already become the property of the county. The exact figure at the close of business today was $366,803.51, and as $12,000 of mineral reservations of the N. P. railroad can not be figured in at this time on account of the matter being in litigation in the supreme court at Helena, only $39,197 remains to be collected. From present indica tions there will be less than a 10 per cent delinquent list this year. Last year the county started out with such percentage but through the efforts of County Treasurer Chappell, the amount was reduced to about 4 per cent, where it now stands. The total valuation of the county's taxable re sources is $11,000,000. NEW 

MEAT MARKET SOON TO BE OPENED Another meat market is promised for the city of Glendive. Elsewhere in this issue of the Monitor will be seen the announcement of L. R. Brinckmann, late of Miles City^ whose intention it is to open, on or^ before Monday, December 20, one of the most up-to-date sanitary meat markets in Eastern Montana. Mr. Brinckmann has had a n um ber of years of valuable experience as head meat cutter with C. J. Wagen breth's meat market in Miles City and is said to know the business from the ground up. The new shop will be lo cated in the Widmyer store on the cor- j ner of Merrill avenuue and Valentine street. It will be completely repaint ed, re-papered and re-decorated, all in white, even to the outside. He promises to make it a strictly sani tary market in ever sense. He is a wide-awake young business man and a staunch believer in local newspaper advertising and his coming into the field will be welcomed by the people, most of whom believe that there is a good field for three high class butch er shops in this locality CHARLES PETERSON CRUSHED UNDER WAGON Another death is added to the long list of similar casualties so far this fall by the untimely death on Tues day afternoon of Charles Peterson of Circle, aged 48 years, who fell under the wheels of a heavily loaded wheat wagon which he was driving to town, and was instantly killed. The exact cause of the accident will probably never be known, although it is supposed that, as he was not in good health, he may have fainted and fell forward while the vehicle was in motion. His back was broken and he must have died instantly. Coroner Kinney was notified of the fatality late Tuesday night and he in structed Justice of the Peace East burn of Circle to get the body and take it to Circle over night. The fol lowing day. Mr. Kinney and Undertak er Ray Lowe went after the remains which were prepared for burial and shipped today to Minneapolis, Minn, for interment. A married daughter and a 15-year old son of the deceased are residents of the Circle country. His wife is ill in one of the Minneapolis hospitals N T o inquest was held as the death was supposed to have been purely acci dental.
