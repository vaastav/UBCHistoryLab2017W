What's the use of a Hague conference again, "Dey ain't no use. iSuch little matters as International .squabbles with Jap an can be far more easily settled. If we really must fight with Japan; If Aokl Is going home to complete the sinister arrangements; If Nippon In tends to fall upon our unsuspecting 'squadron In the straits of Magellan-, If the proud heart of the Samurai Is bursting to erupt over the smiling face of that polite nation; If there's nothing to it, after all, but a desperate con flict Why not settle It by a base ball game. Next to ourselves, Japan Is most civilized of nations. Japan alone has shown an aptitude for our national game. The dark recesses of the dia mond's strategy present no Insuperable difficulty to the Nipponese Intelli gence. Did not ,a picked nine from Toklo or Nagasaki or Fusiyama or somewhere or other defeat the very flower of an American battleship crew only a little while ago? War Is more than ever what the redoubtable general said It was. Should the worst come to the worst with European nations, there might be no al ternative. They still believe in cricket and golf and rowing and skat and a brand of foot ball which employs the feet only.- They have refused to be enlightened by us as Japan has They have consistently repudiated the greatest boon to civilization. An international base ball game to settle such vexed Issues as those of Immigration and mutual relations would adjust the entire matter without either delay or bloodshed. Besides, It would be less expensive. The only danger would be that which might arise from hard feeling.', and in that case it. would be easy to take It out on the umpire. May me commend this to congress, or must Ambassador Aokl take the Initiative?

Every country owes It to the people to give them employment within the confines of Its own territory and when a country gets so that it can no longer do so there is something radically wrong with Its social system. Therefore in aiding In passing an exclusion act against Japanese coolie labor, Japan would only be working towards her own social good if at home she adjusts conditions so as to care for her own people. tkt long as this coun try can promise openings to her young men she will never lack for blood brawn or brains in an emrgincy. When she can no longer provide for them, her days of tribulation are at hand. Judge Parker, who has sentenced nearly every' saloon keeper in Socorro county to pay a small fine for violating the Sunday law. evidently believes that they needed a more practical lesson than a mere lecture. He backed up the fine with the statement that he would impose the Jail sentence hereafter. If the saloon keepers of Socorro county have been violating the law, Judge Parker ought to give them about one day of the Sunday law as It was recently enforced in this city. Too much of a good thing is often needed to teach some people to let well enough alone. The saloon keepers of Socorro county got off easy and they ought to appreciate It.

ORCHARD IS PUT WITNESS STAND IN PETTIBONE TRIAL Told Court That Defendant Said He Shipped Guns In Piano Boxes. fcmXXXXXXXXXXXXTXTTXXXXr Boise, Idaho, Dec. 11. The an nouncement that Orchard would be called as a witness In the Peltibone trial this morning caused the pres ence of many spectators. He was dressed in a business suit and his general abearance showed little change since the Haywood trial. He was perfectly composed ana an swered questions quietly. The early life of Orchard In Can ada was touched upon briefly. He then told of his later life in this country and of the joining of the union, and narrated many of the events leading up to the tragedy of April 29, 18!, when the Bunker and Sullivan mills were blown up. Pettibone's name was brought into the testimony for the first time, when Orchard said the defendant told him n 1S04 that the guns used in 1899 riots were shipped by htan in piano boxes from Denver. As Orchard tes tified Pettlbone and Meyer watched him closejy, but he merely glanced in their direction. The killing of Beck and McCor- muck in the Vindicator mine by a bomb, which Orchard said he and Hilly Alkman placed there for the purpose of killing of non-union men. was detailed by the witness. Before he concluded the narration the noon recess whs taken. Orcliurd Confessing Again. Orchard said he was one of the men who took possesion of a train and went to Wa.-ilner .and that he touched oft one of the boxes of dyn amite which blew the mill to pieces. He told of the calling of troops and the exodus from the district, witness himself going to- Butte, thence to Utah and in 1902 to Cripple Creek. When the strike was called In Aug ust, 1903 he walked out with the others. He testified that W. F. Davis a member of the strike committee. a-'ked him to blow up tlu- mine, while the non-union men were in it and he consented.
