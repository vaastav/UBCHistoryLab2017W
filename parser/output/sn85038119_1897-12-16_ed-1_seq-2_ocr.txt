Exports of other cereals, sucli as oats, rye, barley and buckwheat, have also been very large, and the total value of our cereal exports during the week just closed promises to be fully $9,000,- 000." 

QUAKERS AT WAR. Great Peligious Excitement and Some Damage in an Eastern, Village. Keligious persecutions in Quakertown, a small village near Norwich, Conn., have reached such a point that a serious climax may result. A month ago the members of tho old families decided that the present youth and maiden were being allowed too much levity, and it was to meet this want of seriousness that a re ligious awakening was decided upon. All went well for a time. Solomon Crouch, a carpenter, who was the leader, is a Quaker by birth, but not being a native of Quakertown the young folks looked upon him as an outsider, and some of them distrusted him. He claims to have special revelations from God, and what is revealed to him he preaches to tlie peo ple. It is reported that Crouch went to the home of Lucy Whipple, wife of Allen AVhippio. She told the revivalist she did not believe in his alleged revelations. At this the revivalist is alleged to have be come greatly enraged and struck her in the face with a knife. Tho next morning the Whipple house was burned to the ground, while the neighbors looked on. The following night the older Quakers met in council. The entire neighborhood gathered at the outskirts of the village, and decided to run Crouch out. Armed with shotguns, it is alleged, they sur rounded AYatrous' house and called for Crouch to appear, no and his followers made a stanch stand, and, it is said, not withstanding that charges of buckshot were exchanged, nobody was seriously hurt. During a lull in the fight Crouch and Watrous are reported to have escaped under the cover of darkness. A Modern Sapphira. Gertrude Turecek, a precocious New York City child of 14 years, has since May last sustained and carried out a most preposterous deception which would make Ananias stand and wonder. The child succeeded between last May and Thanksgiving day in securing from her father, Ferdinand Turecek, $1,400, all of his savings, by saying that the money was for President McKinley. For six months the girl had been obtaiuiug amounts ranging from $10 to $100 on the plea that she was lending the money to President McKinley, who, she said, was staying at the Windsor Hotel and was temporarily short of funds. The Turecek girl came home from school one day last spring and told her mother that Mrs. Mc Kinley had visited the school that day and had taken a great fancy to her. She said that the teacher had asked her to play the piano and recite for the Presi dent's wife, and that Mrs. McKinley had been so impressed with her talent that she had asked the girl to call on her at the Windsor. The mother and father of the child believed her story unquestion ably. The child returned from the sup posed visit and triumphantly announced that Mrs. McKinley was going to adopt her. Later she told her father President McKinley was pressed for ready money, as he didn't want to use checks, and her father gave her $100 to loan him. From time to time, with similar stories, she se cured money from her father in the same way. The girl was lavish with her money, and gave presents to all her friends, but most of the things she brought home, say ing President McKinley had sent them. Rujsla Buys Arm 6upp les. The report that the Russian Govern ment is buying large quantities cf army supplies in the United States has been verified at San Francisco. Cable mes sages from Yladivostock asking that mer chants bid on large lots are frequently re ceived. Dodge, Sweeney & Co of San Francisco received a Vladivostock cable to figure on 1,200 tons of supplies. Trav elers arriving from Asia report that the garrison it Yladivostock has been largely re-enforced by the arrival ot troops on steamers and sailing vessels from the Black Sea. The concentration of Rus sian troops at that point and the haste that Japan is making to increase her pow er on the sea leads some of the merchants to predict that the impending confiict be tween Itussia and Japan may open as early as next summer. The recent heavy orders for army supplies to be forwarded to Yladivostock arc regarded as signifi cant of important movements in the ori ent. It is believed that the completion of the Transsiberian Railroad, with its ter minus at Yladivostock, will largely in crease the trade of San Francisco, and there is talk of establishing a line of steamers to that place, touching at Alas kan ports. A local subsidy of $3,000 a month has already been subscribed for an Alaskan line. Bo:d Coup in Italy. The Borne correspondent of the London Morning Post says: "The cabinet has re signed. Gen. Pcllicux's action is regard ed as a political move to make it possi ble for the Marquis di Rudini to secure a unanimous ministry. The ministers of finance, justice and public works in the retiring cabinet will not appear in its suc cessor." Gen. Pellienx, minister of war, maintains the attitude ho has taken, in consequence ot the nction of parlia ment in amending a bill dealing with army promotion against his advice, and persists in his resignation. King Hum bert, the Marquis di Budini, the premier, and the other members of tlie cabinet urged Gen. Pellienx to reconsider his ac tion, but he refused to do so. erious Break Threatened. The combination of Western railroads and certain steamship lines known as. the Western Lines Association, the purpose of which is to control tlie immigrant traf fic, is threatened with disruption. The fact that two members of the association have cut rates between Chicago and St. Paul from $11.50 to $7 is believed to be the entering wedge which will eventually wreck the combine. Some of the outside lines are powerful enough to menace the combine and perhaps to smash it. The outsiders include the Union Pacific Bail road, the Chicago and Alton, the Chicago Grer.t Western and the Missouri, Kan sas and Texas railroads. Lack of Water In Kansas. Owing to the extremely dry weather this fall water was never so scarce in the history of Kansas as it is now. Emporia is at the junction of the Neosho and the Cottonwood rivers, and for weeks not a drop of water has been flowing in either. About Alasian Travel. A letter has been received by the Cham ber of Commerce of San Francisco from the Citizens' Klondike Company of Ta- coma, expressing a willingness to assist in any movement looking to the closing of Dyea as a subport of entry. The ener getic methods of the Canndian Govern ment to capture the bulk of the Klondike travel is dwelt upon at length, and figures are given to show what an immense reve nue may be derived from tho tax on the outfits of the prospectors alone, if some means is not taken to retaliate. Tho Alaska trade bureau of San Francisco has received a letter from ex-Governor Jo soph Iloadly, who is associated with the ship-building firm of William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia in the States Steam ship Company, stating that five steam ships of over 3,000 tons each nre to be placed on the ocean route nnd will con nect with a small Meet of river boats, reaching all parts of Alaska. The com pany is capitalized at $7,000,000. 

MEETS A STRANCE DEATH. William Evarts, of St. Clair, Ma, Is Hanged Between Two Palings. William Evarts of St. Clair, Mo., came to his deatii under peculiar circumstances. He was found hanging to a hig'i paling fence. His neck was wedged firmly be tween two palings. His feet were clear of the ground and his neck was broken. Evarts had lieen working about his home and had used a wheelbarrow. When the body was found the Vueelbarrow was partly under it. His pockets were empty, but it is not known whether he had any thing with him or not. Those who saw him say he was cheerful and had not been drinking, and it is believed he must have fallen on the fence and caught between the palings. To Control the Gold Output A gold trust is the latest norelty in Jersey City. The official name under which the concern is incorporated is the Menlo Trading Company. The incorpo rators aic Charles N. King, Nelson K. Vanderhoof and Augustus C. Kellogg, all of Jersey City. These men are supposed to be agents of the bonanza kings, who will manage the trust. The articles of in corporation statt that the object of the company is to acquire and purchase gold mines and establish factories for the treat ment of ores. It was said that the new company will include the owners of the principal mines in California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Mexico, and that the aim of these capitalists is to control the gold output of the United States. Uncte Sam Will Bid. The Secretary of the Treasury at Wash ington has taken the first steps to qualify on behaif.of the Government as a bidder at the sale of the Kansas Pacific Railroad on Dec. 10. A transfer order for $900, 000 was sent by Treasurer Roberts for certification to the Nntional City Bank of New York in favor of the master of the court having jurisdiction of the case. This order will be delivered to the master five days before the sale by an officer of the Treasury Department, who, it is believed, will bid nt tlie sale under instructions from the President. Trading Stamps Unlawfu'. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, in an opinion by Justice Shep ard, held that "trading stamps" are ille gal within the meauing of the act of Con gress prohibiting lotteries and gift enter prises. The Trading Stamp Company had made arrangements with many companies by which trading stamps were given pur chasers and when a certain number of stamps were obtained articles could be obtained for them at the stamp company's store. Dig for a Whisky Mine. A Kansas City telegram says: The com pany digging for the old steamer Arabia, which sank with a cargo of whisky in the Missouri thirty-five years ago, has struck the place. It is now digging for the sub merged stuff, which it believes is still in fine condition, and expects to clear $100, 000. The cargo consisted of 185 barrels. Ciod News Saves His Life. Robert Hansel, destitute, was dying of typhoid fever at Watcrbury, Conn., when a telegram came from Decatur saying his uncle, Mayor Taggart's brother, had died leaving him his fortune. Hansel was able to grasp the news that fortune had come to him and began to rally at once. Accommodates ths Railroads. Tlie interstate commerce commission has decided to extend for two years the period within which railroads must com ply with tlie act of Congress requiring all railroads to be equipped with safety ap pliances for the protection of the em ployes and passengers.

President McKiniey's first annual mes sage was read before both houses of Con gress at noon Monday. He congratulated Congress upon assemblying under felicit ous conditions. Teace and good will with all the nations of the earth continue un broken, he says, nnd we should feel gen uine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and unification in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party preju dice. Beginning with the subject of the finances the President says that while the full effect of the legislation of the extra session has not 3'ct been realized what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness and wisdom. To test its permanent vnlue further time will be re quired and the people, satisfied with its operation and results thus far, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. The next question pressing for consideration is that of the currency. With the great resources of the Government and with the honorable example of the past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currency revision which will make out demand obligation less onerous to the Government and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity nnd doubt. The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the Government of main taining at n parity, with gold our different forms of money and tlie experience of the past four years has demonstrated that this is not only an expensive charge upon the Government, but a dangerous menace to the national credit. It is mani fest that we must devise some plan to pro tect the Government against bond issues for repeated redemptions We have nine hundred millions of currency which the Government, by solemn enactment, has undertaken to keep at par, and nobody is obliged to redeem in gold but tho Gov ernment, which must borrow the gold. Redemption of Treasury Notes. The law which requires payment out of the treasury of unredeemed United States notes demnnds a constant replen ishment of the gold reserve, especially in times of panic and insufficient revenue and during the precceding administration $202,315,400 4y2 per cent, bonds were is sued and sold io sustain the gold reserve and pay the expenses of the Government in excess of revenue. While it i3 true that a greater part of this is used' to sup ply deficient revenues, a considerable por tion was required to maintain the gold re serve. If no further legislation is to be had to correct this and the policy of sell ing bonds is to be continued, then Con gress should give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. The President says: "I earnestly recom mend as soon as the receipts of the Gov ernment are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government that when any United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and arc redeemable in gold, such notes shall be kept nnd set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty;-if the hold er of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the Government he should not receive back from the Govern ment a United States note without paying gold in exehnnge for it." That nmounts, to the President's mind, to giving an interest-bearing debt, a Government bond, for a non-interest-bearing debt, a United States note. The Government should be relieved from the burden of providing all the gold required for exchange, and ex ports. This ought to be stopped. With an era of prosperity and sufficient receipts we may feel no immediate embarrass ment, but' the danger will be ever present. The President invites careful consider ation for the detail plan of the Secretary of the Treasury to protect the gold re serve. He concurs with him in the rec ommendation that national banks be al lowed to issue notes to the face value of their bonds deposited; that the circulating tax be reduced to one-half of 1 per cent, and that national banks may be establish ed with a capital of $25,000. He also rec ommends that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the, denomtnniion of $10 nnd upwards, and that they" be re quired to redeem their notes in gold. The Cuban Question. Turning to foreign affairs the President devotes much space in his. message to a consideration of the Cuban question, which he says is the most important prob lem with which our Government is now called upon to deal in its foreign rela tions. Summariziug the history of the former outbreaks, the President comes down to the present insurrection. Speak ing of Its remarkable increase, its tena cious existence against enormous forces massed by Spain, the' widespread destruc tion of property and the disregard of the civilized code of war on both sides, he says these conditions give rise to gravest apprehensions. There is no desire on our part to profit by Spain's misfortunes, and we have only the desire to see the Cubans enjoying that measure of self control which is the inalienable right of man. Of the concentration policy of Weyler he says: "It has utterly failed ns a war measure. It is not civilized war fareit is extermination." Against this abuse of the rights of wnr the President says he has felt constrained on repeated occasions to enter the firm and honest protest of tins uovernment. He outlines his instructions to Minister Woodford, which were in substance to impress upon the Spanish Government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable to Spain and to the Cuban people. It was also asked whether Spain of her own volition should not make proposals for settlement, and it was said that he could not contemplate an indefi nite period for the accomplishment of this result. The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford was. in the President's opinion, in the direction of a better understanding. It ndmittcd our friendly purposes and deep Interest, and declared that the new gov ernment was bound to n change of pol icy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end political reforms will be put into effect and military opera tions conducted on humane lines, it was suggested that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grant po litical reforms, while the United Stales for its part, should enforce neutral obli gations and cut off tlie assistance which' the insurgents, it was asserted, received from this country. Early and complete pacification is hoped for. Spain's Charge Is Baseless. The President declares that the Span ish disposition to charge us with failure to meet international duties is baseless, and points to the efforts this government have made at tlie cost of millions, nnd by tlie employment of the administrative mnchincrv of the nation to perforin its full dutv. He also says that the fact that no military expedition or armed ves sel has left our shores lias been diplo matically represented to Spam. I re mising that throughout all tlie horror and danger to our own peace, the United States has never abrogated its right to determine its nolicy as to Cuba, the I res- idratpoiuteofit that "of untried measure,! there remains only: Recognition of the insurgents as belligerents, recognition of the independence of Cuba, neutral inter vention to end the war lv imposing a ra tional compromise between the contest ants, an intervention in favor of one or the other party, lie says: "I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of. That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression." Taking up the -question of belligerency, the President quotes at length from Pres ident Grant's message of December 7, 1S75, wherein ho declared that the con ditions in Cuba warranted neither the recognition of independence nor tho rec ognition of belligerency. He adds that moreover a recognition of belligerency would confer upon neither party to tlie conflict a status uot theretofore actually possessed, while it would weigh heavily in Spain's behalf, giving her tlie right of search on the high seas and extend ing her maritime rights to the margin of our territorial waters. Recognition Unwise. For these reasons the President regards recognition of the belligerency of tlie Cu ban insurgents as now unwise and there fore inadmissible. Should that step here after be deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty, tlie executive will take it." He points to the hopeful change in the Spanish policy to the pledge of reform and to tho abatement of the horrors of war as reasons against intervention on humanitarian grounds. The first acts of the new government lie in the honorable paths it has outlined; the policy of rapine and extermination has been reversed; broad clemencies proffered; measures have been taken to relieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it is asserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation, but to pro tect tho resumption of agricultural in dustries. Tlie President sketches the au tonomy scheme of the Spanisli govern ment and says that it is honestly due to Spain that she should bo given a reason able chance to realize her expectations and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of tilings to which she stands irrevocably committed. He points to the many concessions already made, to the modification of tlie horrible order of con centration, to the release of the Com petitor prisoners, and tho fact that not a single American citizen is now under arrest in Cuba. Ho says tlie near fu ture will demonstrate whether a righ teous peace is likely to be attained; if not: tho exigency of further and other action by the United States will remain to be taken. Sure of the right, the gov ernment will continue its watchful cares over every American citizen, and its ef forts to bring about honorable peace, and, says tlie President, "If it shall here after appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and to humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only because tho necessity for such ac tion will bo so ciear as to command the support and approval of the civilized world." Hawaiian Annexation Favored. The President next takes up the sub ject of tho annexation of Hawaii, which, he says, should be accomplished. Rap idly reviewing his former arguments in favor of annexation, lie says that legisla tion is required in the event of tlie ratifi cation of the treaty and, while nbrupt as similations of immnture elements of pop ulation should be avoided, just provision should he made for self-rule in local mat ters with tho largest political liberty to the Hawaiians. He says that tlie dis pute between Japan and Hawaii over the immigration question is now in a satis factory stage of settlement by negotia tion: that oiir government has not inter vened, and that it is learned that Japan is now confident in the intention of this government to deal with all possible ul terior questions affecting her interests in the broadest spirit of friendliness. Central American Matters. Reference is made to the failure of Mr. Merry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on account of the obligations of that country to the Diet of tlie Great er Republic of Central America. As there is no legal nuthority at present to accredit him to the Diet, Mr. Baker, the present minister nt Managua, has been directed to present his letters of recall. Mr. W. Godfrey Hunter is said to be like wise accredited to Honduras, a member of the Greater Republic, nnd his case is awaiting action. Tho Nicaragua Canal Is spoken of as of large Importance to our country and the promise Is made of further reference to the subject which In the report ot the commis sion now at work Is sent to Congress. The President says of tho International monetary commission that, notwithstanding diligent effort the envoys have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratification Is ex pressed at the action of France In this matter In Joining In oar efforts and It Is said that the negotiations are still pending. Meanwhile the envoys have not made their final report, believing that the doubts raised In certain quarters respecting the feasibility of maintaining parity between gold and sil ver may yet be solved. Tho president earn estly hopes that their labors may bring about an international agreement. Mr. Kasson, of Iowa, Is said to bo now conducting negotiations with several gov ernments for reciprocity arrangements un der the tariff act. and It Is believed that by a carefnl exercise of the powers conferred by the act, some grievances of our own and other countries In onr mutual trade relations may be removed or alleviated and the vol ume of our commercial exchanges enlarged. The President earnestly urges the Improve ment of our merchant marine, the Inferiority of which, he says, is humiliating to the na tional pride. The Scnlinjr Conferences. Reference Is made to the recent confer ences at Washington on the subject ot the protection of seal life, the result of which places beyond controversy. It Is said, the duty of the government's concern to adopt measures without delay for the preservation of the herds. Negotiations to this end aro now In progress. International arbitration Is declared by the President to represent the best sentiment of the civilized world anil treaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines, without In any way Imperiling our Interests or honor, will have Its constant encourage ment. A liberal appropriation Is bespoken In or der that the United States may make a crcdltablo exhibit at the approaching Paris exposition, In which the people have shown an unprecedented interest. Under the head of the navy, the President points to the necessity for speedy legislation to procure nruior for tho three battleships now building, which would be otherwise use less. He speaks In terms of praise of the quality of our ships and thinks that the time lias now arrived when the Increase to which the country Is committed should for a time take the form of Increased facilities com mensurate with the Increase of our naval vessels. He refers to the lack of docks and urges that three or four of the largest docks bo provided en the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific coast nnd a floating dock In the Gulf. There should also be ample provision for munitions of war and nn Increase of officers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessary to navy yards nnd. as there are now on tho stocks live large battleships. It Is recommended tnat an appropriation ne made but for one more battleship on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo Loats are also necessary. LcKislation for Alaskn. Attention Is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. There Is need for surveys and for the establishment cf another land office at some point In the Yukon valley, for which an appropriation Is asked. Military force Is also necessary and the establishment of some flexible govern ment. If the startling reports as 10 me iu nblo shortage of food for tlie miners be fully verified, every effort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. The message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of affairs In the In dian Territory. The large white element Is said to be without protection and without schools or other rights of citizens; leading Indians have absorbed great tracts of lands and created an arlstocrocy, and the friends of the Indians believe that the best Interests of the live civilized tribes would be found In American citizenship. Iteference Is made to tho failure so far of the Dawes commis sion to secure the consent of the tribes to an extinguishment of the tribal titles and a division of the lands. It Is said that should the tribes still fall to ratify the agreement then some legislation should be had by Con gress. , The President approves the recommenda tion or the Secretary of the Treasury for an extension of the quarantine laws nnd also suggests the appointment of a special com mission to ascertain the cause of yellow fever. . ., Speaking of the pending sale of the Kan sas. Pacific Railroad. It Is said that If no bet ter bid Is received than the upset price fixed by the court, the government would re ceive only $2,.ri00,000 on Its claim of nearly $1.1,000,000. lie believes that the govern ment has the authority to bid on tho road and has directed the Secretary of the Treasury to make the deposit ot 

S'.IOO.OOO required to qualify as a bidder anil to bid at the sale :. sum at least equal to me principal "i mu debt to the government. He suggests, how ever, that In a matter so Important as the government becoming a possible owner of the railroad. Congress should enact some leg islation to define lti views. It Is clear to him, however, that the government should nnt normlt tlie nronertv to be sold at a price Us than one-half tho principal ot Us debt and less than one-fifth of Its entire debt, principal and Interest. Improvement of the Civil Service. The President devotes the last chapter of hl3 message to the civil service, the prac tical Improvement of which, ho says, has long been a subject of earnest discussion,' and which has of late years received In creased legislative and executive approval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of busi ness methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to re instatement has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons havo been care fully guarded against: the examinations Im proved and made practical and n distinct ad vance has been made by giving a hearing be fore dismissal upon all cases where Incom petency Is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been done without Impairing the power of removal, one of the Ital safeguards of t'se system. Much rema'ns to be done before the system can be perfected, and the President" says (Lat he shall not hesitate to exempt cases which" he thinks have been Improperly in cluded In the clnslfled service or Include those which In his Judgment will best pro mote the public service. The system has the approval of the people and it will be his en deavor to uphold and extend It. In conclusion, the President admonishes Congress not to encourage tiie Increase of the estimates for the maintenance of the government. They would admit of decrease In many brandies and It Is a commanding duty to keep the appropriations within the lecclpts of the government and thus avoid a deficit. 

MAKING OF BEET SUGAR. Northern Indiana Greatly Interested in the Industry. Since the discovery that lands in north, western Indiana are suitable for the cul ture of the sugar beet considerable in terest has been manifested in the indus try by farmers. The latter have made many inquiries as to whether they can produce sugar on their own farms from the sugar beet. Authentic information cm this subject is contained in a letter written recently to the Agriculturist Epitouiist by Prof. H. W. Wiley, chief chemist of the United States Department of Agriculture, Wash ington. The letter follows: The production of a crude beet sugar In a small way Is an extremely simple process. Any farmer who Is equipped with a cider mill for rasping the beets, a elder press for expressing the Juice and an evaporator suit able for making sorghum molasses, can produce a crude beet sugar. As a rule, this sugar will not be very palatable, because It Is not refined and con tains the salts and bitter principles which mako raw beet sugar and beet molasses, as a rule, unfit for table use. It will be, however, an Interesting object lesson to our farmers to "demonstrate the fact that the sugar beet Itself contains sugar, and that the latter can be made In the crude way I have mentioned above. In this way the making of sugar In a small way by farmers may prove a stimulus to the Industry and do great good. Farmers, however, should not bo de ceived by the expectation of being able to make their sugar In a successful way com mercially. The successful and prpfltable manufac ture of sugar can only be accomplished In cxpensivo factories, equipped with all the appliances necessary to make a pure refined sugar. Only the pnro refined beet sugar can ever become an article of commerce. In this the beet differs from the sngar cane, because the latter will give a sugar which, even In the crude state. Is palatable and marketable; In fact, many people prefer crude cane sugar to the refined article on account of Us containing the aromatic prin ciples of the cane, which give It an odor and flavor very acceptable to most palates. I trust that any of your readers who may undertake the manufacture of beet sugar in the crude way I have mentioned above may do so only from the point of view Indicated, and not with the expectation of making It a commercial success. AUSTRIA'S NEW PREMIER. Baron Gantscli "Von Frankcnthurn Recognized ns nn Able Man. Baron Gautsch Von Frankcnthurn, the new premier of Austria, is recognized by cll parties as the man best able to master tlie present situation. He did not espouse the cause of any one faction, and because of tlie able and impartial manner in which he discharged his duties as minister of public instruction under the premiership of Count Badeni he enjoys the confidence of all. His wide knowledge of affairs and his diplomatic methods recommended him to the high position to which he has been appointed. It is thought that he will de vise some amicable means of patching up the existing differences of the- German and Bohemian speaking people of the em pire. The baron is one of the most schol arly men of the empire and an orator of no mean ability. His speeches before par liament have always attracted a throng. He is the author of several legal works. The people love him and delight to refer to him as a self-made man. Tlie baron is tall and fine looking, with a handsome face. His hair was gray before he was 35. News cf Minor Note. Scnor Jorge Tezanos Pinto, father-in-law of President Uriburu of Argentina, and the Argentina consul in Lima, is dead at Lima, Peru.

The Government of Japan has sent an order to locomotive builders in Jersey City for fifteen locomotives for use ou heavy trains. Work -on tlie locomotives will be begun at once. An attempt to hold up and rob a pas senger train on the Mexican National road near Monterey, Mex., was made by nine masked and well-armed Mexicans. The passengers made resistance and the outlaws were unsuccessful. District Attorney Finical of Albu querque, N.

V charter has been granted for the Southern Sugar Refining Company at Richmond, Va. The maximum capital of tlie company is to be $1,000,000. The object is to encourage the raising of sugar beets and the manufacture of beet sugar. It is the pioneer enterprise of the kind in that section. The stockholders of thi California Winemakcrs' corporation, which controls the bulk of tlie output of the State, havo decided to enter the markets of tlie world and try to dispose of the immense stock now on hand, and which, owing to trouble between the corporation and the wae dealers, cannot be sold to local dealers.

The extra session robbed the opening of the regular session of the excitement and in terest which usually attach to it. As the House was completely organized at the extra session, and all the committee assignments were made then, beyond the natural stimulus produced by the return ing statesmen aud the outlining of schemes by members of the "third house" or lobby, Washington ou the night preced ing the opening was tranquil. The ceremonies attending the opening ot Congress, though comparatively of a routine character, make a spectacle which in some respects is regarded as the great est official event of the year at the na tional capital. Monday the weather was propitious. The sun shone brilliantly from a cloudless sky, making a glorious, bright December day, with a tinge of frost in the air to invigorate the lungs and a breeze just strong enough to keco the stars and stripes snapping from tho Dag staffs. At tho capitol the crowd swarm ed into the corridors at an early hour and "choked the marble steps as they ascended to tlie galleries from which they were to view the show. As is usual ou such occa sions, the reserved galleries were careful ly guarded on both the House and Senate sides, admission being only by card, and the public had great difHculty..in wedging itself into the limited space set aside for it. The Hall of Representatives presented an animated appearance long before the hour of noon arrived. The surrounding corridors were filled with jostling, mov ing crowds, and before 11 o'clock the en circling galleries which overlooked" the floor were black with people. The hall buzzed with tlie subdued hum of conver sation as the members exchanged greet ings and chatted in groups. . The tloral tributes for the members were numerous and in some instances im posing. The program at the House Monday was very simple. The House was called to order by the Speaker, who, after the chap Iain's invocation, directed the Clerk to call the roll. This having been accom plished, and the presence of a quorum demonstrated, the clerk was directed to notify the Senate that the House was ready for business, and a committee was appointed to wait on the President. After that there was a recess to await the ar rival ot the President's annual message, which was read upon its reception and was followed by an adjournmeut until Tuesday. It is the intention of the House leaders to proceed with the business ot the ses sion as rapidly as possible. The commit tees will all begin their labors at once. The appropriations committee has been at work for ten days, and Chairman Cannon expects to pass two of the regular budgets before the holidays. Among the early general measures to re ceive consideration will be tho bankruptcy bill. Whether it will be the Nelson bill, which passed the Senate at the last ses sion, or a modification of the Torreybill depends on the temper of the Judiciary Committee, which will submit the meas ure to the House. Beyond donbt there will be several res olutions of inquiry during the. first week which may be more or less sensational, and some of the radical pro-Cuba mem bers will attempt to get consideration tor .a Cuban resolution before the Foreign Affairs Committee can act, but owing to the nature of the nouso rules all these hasty efforts will prove abortive, and they probably will take their regular course. Simultaneously with the fall of Speaker Reed's gavel in the House, Vice Presi dent Hobart called tlie Senate to order, naif an hour before the Senate convened tlie public aud executive aud reserved gal leries were filled with spectators to wit ness the opening of the session. The hand some costumes of tho ladies added much to the brightness of tho scene. The Sen ate chamber at the opening was a verita ble conservatory. The iloral display was unusually rich and beautiful, nnd the odor of flowers was heavy iii tho hall. Seventy-seven Senators responded to their names on the roll call. The Senate to start with had a calendar of about 300 bills reported from the com mittees during the special session. The indications on tlie opening day were for a little more activity than usual during the pro-holiday session. This is largely due to the fact that the supporters of the ad ministration and advocates of annexation are very anxious to secure the earliest possible consideration of the treaty with Hawaii. Senator Davis, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, an nounced his purpose of pressing annexa tion at the earliest possible moment. One point which the committee will be called upon to decide is whether to proceed to ratify the treaty of annexation or to an nex the islands by resolutions. The an nexationists have lost some votes during the vacation, and there is now apprehen sion that the two-thirds vote necessary to assure the ratification cannot be secured. Some members of the Foreigns Relations Committee who favor annexation advo cate this course because they say they see no reason for traversing the same ground twice, as they would be compelled to do in case tlie matter should be first considered in executive session, fail there, and then be taken up in the form of a resolution in open Senate and House. Despite all opposition, it is not doubted Hawaii will be brought under the stars and stripes. No act of the American Con gress in many years past has attracted as much attention throughout the world as the annexation of a distant island is sure to attract. What Congress will do concerning -the President's presentation of the State of our relations to Spain and Cuba only the future can determine. Unless some turn of events rouses public opinion and finds response in Congress it may be regarded as fairly certain tne peace policy or tlie President will be supported by both houses of the national legislature. Tho President's message, read between the lines, does not indicate that he lias aban doned Cuba, but rather that he hopes in the future to achieve the practical inde pendence of that island should Spain's present efforts to restore peace prove fruitless, and by methods which will be the fruits of natural causes, and which will not necessarily tiring on war between the United States and Spain. Other topics which will be sure to cause much talk throughout the world, and some of which may lie the subject of ac tual legislation, are revision" of the immi gration laws, bankruptcy, pooling by rail ways, rehabilitation of the interstate com merce commission, prevention ot scalping of railway tickets, the Central Pacific Railway's debt to the Government and the revenues of the Government uader the Dingley law. The immigration bill, for which Sena tor Lodge stands sponsor, is practically m Jlllll ij at the head of the Scnaie Icgislallte cal endar, and will be considered early in tho session. Senator Lodge has repeated his intention of pressing the bill, but he will not antagonize the Ilawaiian treaty with it The first bill on the calendar is Senator Gear's measure providing for the adjust ment of the Pacific Railroad debt, but the sale of the Union Pacific" doubtless will have the effect of causing the tem porary withdrawal of this bill and the substitution or others.' Of the 300 bills on the calendar about 200 are private pen sion bills, and all of these probably will bo disposed of at one sitting when taken up. There are also several hundred recess appointments to be considered in execu tive session. 

ECKELS MAKES REPORT. Reviews National Banks and Favors Amending Note-Issuing Law. The annual report of Jamc3 H. Eckels, Comptroller of the Currency, for the year ended Oct. 31, 1S07, opens with a brief review of the history of the legislation which constitutes the present national bank act, and invites the attcntiou of Congress to amendments to the law rec ommended in former reports without spe cifically repeating them. On the subject of bank note circulation the Comptroller says: It Is noticeable that In all the changes which have been wrought In the national currency act from Its Inception to the pres ent time the feature subject to criticism, bnt which was Intended should constitute the principal benefit to be conferred, has remained comparatively unchanged name ly, the note-Issuing function. Whatever Jus tification there was In the first instance Tor restricting the issuing of notes against the bonds of the Government, deposited wh the Treasurer of the United States, to DO per cent, of tho par value thereof, ha3 Ioug since ceased. In the report of every Comp troller of the Cnrrcney during the last twen ty years the wisdom of changing the exist ing law so that the banks and through them the communities In which they are located might have the additional benefit of an add ed loanable capital has been urged. De fplto all this the law still remains without amendment. Not only should the hank act be amended In this particular, but Con gress should seriously consider such a change In tho method of bank note Issues as will enable the banks of the country to more ade quately meet the demands of trade and com merce In all sections of the country. It Is considered by every great commercial government, except the United States, to be the solo province of the banks to Issue tho paper which circulates as currency. Tho belief In a bank note currency as being better and safer than a government paper currency prevailed nnqnestioned In this conntry, until, under the apparent exigen cies of the war, the Government undertook to Issue paper currency. Even under such circumstances the promise wau already giv en, however, that It should be retired at the earliest practical moment, and the admis sion freely made that It was neither a wlso measure nor a safe form of currency. Between the competition of the Govern ment note Issues on the one hand and tho unnecessary restrictions Imposed by law up on the other, together with tho Increasing price of bonds required to be deposited as security, the note Issuing function of tho banks has been permitted to become merely an Incident to tne condnct of the national banking associations of the country. It has been seriously suggested more than once that the bank note Issues be done away with, and all paper be Issued by the Government In stead. The danger of such a conrse-Is not to be overestimated. The experience of every government has been that governmental cur rency paper Is a source of weakness and danger. In the United States, where there has been the nearest approach to success, with the volume of the Federal paper com paratively limited In amount, the credit of the Government has been more than once put In Jeopardy through It, and the business interests of the country subjected to unnec essary loss and confusion. The argument that the Government better than the banks can provide for the redemp tion of paper note Issue wilt not stand the test of a careful analysis. The Government has no means for caring for Its demand liabil ities, except through borrowing and through tlie levying of taxes. Upon the other hand, the banks have assets which can be prompt ly converted Into cash to meet their out standing notes when presented. Thetal nnmber of national banks or ganized since the system was put into operation, in 1SG3, is sliown to have been 5,005. On Oct. 31 last there were in act ive operation 3.G17, having an authorized capital of $030,230,205. The total out standing circulation of the banks then in operation was $220,109,550; of which ?202,01',555 was secured by bonds of tho United States, and the balance by law ful money deposited with the Treasurer of the United States. The total circula tion outstanding of .all national banks on Oct. 31 last was $230,131,005, of which amount $l,55S,S0O was secured by bonds held for account of insolvent and liquida ting banks, and $20,205,325 by lawful money deposited for their account and by active banks reducing circulation. The net decrease in the amount of circulation secured by bonds during the year was $12,5S4,334 and the gross decrease in the total circulation was $4,551,292. During the year forty-fonr banks were organized, with an aggregate capital stock of $0,420,000." During the year seventy one banks went into voluntary liquida tion. There was paid to creditors of insolvent banks during the year $13,1C9,7S1 in div idends. The magnitude of this unequaled record, the report says, will be mere forci bly illustrated it considered in the light of what has been accomplished heretofonT in the way of dividend payments to the creditors of insolvent institutions. In 1S93 there was paid in dividends $3,433,-(J-W; in 1S94, $5,124,577; in 1S95, $3,3S0, 552; in 1S9G, $2,451,959, and in 1S97, $13, 1C9.7S1, making a total of dividends paid within the five years from 1S93 to 1S97. of $27,500,515, or 3Cl per cent, of all tho dividends that have ever been p-iid to creditors of insolvent banks. From 1SG3 to 1597 there has been paid in dividends $75,035,925, and in the year embraced in this report ?13,1C9,7S1, or 17 1-3 per cent of all the dividends that have been paid during the period of thirty-four years of tho existence of the system. Since Oct 31. the end of the report year, seventeen additional dividends have been ordered, amounting in the aggregate to abont$025, 000. The report contains the latest compiled statistics relating to the world's monetary systems, nnd tlie stock of gold, silver and paper currency. A very interesting fea ture of this statement is the pet capita amount of each kind of money in the countries named. The per capita aver ages in the principal countries of the world are as follows: United States, $23.70: United King dom, $20.05; France, $34.GS; Germany, $18.95; Austria-Hungary, $9.33, and Rus sia, $S.95. The Comptroller renews his recommen dation of last year, urging that national bank examiners be paid an annual salary instead of fees as now. A Little Problem from Lire. no begjred a kiss.
