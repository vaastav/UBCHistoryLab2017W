FtUrKr-CHItnt af Iht Snate md Hutu of lleiireetn- Oar heartfelt gratitude ia due to the Di vine Being, who holda in Bia banda the deatiniea of nations, for the continued be atowal, darina; the lat year, of countless bleesinga upon oar country. We are at peace with all other nations Our public credit has greatly improved, and ia, perhapa, now atronirer than ever before. Abundant harvena have rewarded the labors of those who till the aoil, our manu facturing induatriea are reviving, and it ia believed that general prosperity, which has been so long anxiously looked for, ia at last within onr reach. THK PKXTILENC B J The enjoyment of health of our people generally haa, however, been interrupted, dnringthe past seaaon, by the prevalence of fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some porttona of the Southern States, Treating an emergency which called for prompt and extraordinary measures of re lief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans ana at other places on the Ixwer Missisaippi, soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugitives from the infected eitiea and towns, and did not dis appear nntil early in November. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Ten nessee have su tiered severely. About one hundred thousand coses are believed to have occurred, in which about twenty thou sand, according to intelligent estimate?, proved fatal. It ia impossible to estimate, with any approach to accuracy, the loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic. It ia to be reckoned oy the hundred milliona of dollars. The suffering and destitution that resulted, excited the deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union. Physicians and nurses hastened from every quarter to the assistance of the afflicted communities. Voluntary contributions of money and aupplies, in every needed form, were speedily and generously furnished. The Government was able to respond in some measure to to the call for help, by providing tents, medicines, and food for the sick and destitute, the requisite directions for the purpose being given, in the confident ex pectation that this action of the Executive would receive the aanction of Congress. A hont eighteen hundred tents, and rations of the value of about twenty-five thousand dollars, were aent to eitiea and towns which applied for them, full details of which will be furnished to Congress by the proper De partment. The fearful spread of this pestilence has wakened a very general public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administra tion, which shall not only control quaran tine, but have the sanitary supervision of InUrnal commerce in timea of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the State and municipal health authorities, with power to deal with whatever endangers the Rublio health, and which the municipal ate authorities are unable to regulate. The national quarantine act approved April 29, 1878, which was passed too late in the laat session of Congresa to provide the means for carrying it into practical opera tion, during the paataeason, ia a atep in the direction here indicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for the protec tion oi our seaports, ana me country gen erally, from this and other epidemics, it is recommended that Congress give to the whole subject early and careful considera tion. rACIFICATIOX OF the cochtry. The permanent pacification of the country by the complete protection of all citizens in every eivil ana political right continues to be of paramount intereat with the great body of our people. Every atep in this direction ia welcomed with public approval, and every interruption of steady and uni form progress to the desired consummation wakena general uneasiness and wide-spread condemnation. The recent Congressional elections have furnished a direct and trust worthy test of the advance thus far made in the practical eatabishment of the right of a u 8 rage, aecured by the Conatitution to the liberated race in the Southern States. All disturbing influences, real or imaginary, had been removed from all these States. The three constitutional amendments, which conferred freedom and equality of eivil and political rights upon the colored people of the South, were adopted by the concurrent notion of the great body of good eitiaena who maintained the authority, of the National Government, and the integrity and perpetuity of the Union at such a cost of treasure and life as a wise and necessary embodiment in the organic law of the just result of the ar. The people of the former slave-holding States accepted these results, and rave, in everv practicable form enr. ancea that the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, and lawa passed in pursuance thereof, should, in good faith, be enforced, rigidly and impartia'ly, in letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen, without distinction of race or color ahould, under them, receive full and equal protection in person and property and in political righte and privileges. By these constitutional amendmenta, the Southern aeetion of the Union obtain a large increase of political power in Congress and in the Electoral College, and the country justly expected that elections would proceed, aa to the enfranchised race, upon the same rirenmstanoea of legal and constitutional freedom and protection which ia obtained In all the other States of the Union. The frienda of law and order looked forward to the conduct of these elections, as offering to the general judgment of the country an mportant opportunity to measure the de gree in which the right of suffrage could be exercised by the colored nnnUant nnl.i be repeated by their tellow-cuiiena, but a more general enioyment of freedom of suffrage by the colored people, and a more last and generona protection of th.t t.m by the communities of which they form a part, were generally anticipated than the record of the elections dicln. i . of those States in which the colored eot.l have been unable to make their opinions felt ia he eleetions, the result is mainly due to influences not easily measured , m edied by legal protection ; but in the States of .Louisiana and South Carolina at large, and in some particular Congressional dis tricts outside of th. se States, the records of the elections seem to eoraiel the conclusion that the righta of the colored voters have been overridden, and their participation in the electiona not permitted to be either general or free. It ill be for the Congress for which these electiona were held, to make auoh examina tions into their conduct aa may be appro VOLUME VI. priate to determine the validity of the claima of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it becomes tre duty of the Ex ecutive and Judicial Departments of the Government, each in its province, to inquire into and punish violations of the laws of the United States which have occurred. I can but repeat what I said in this connec tion in my lait message, that whatever au thority rests with me to thia end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts, the executive authorities, and the people of the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assist ance toward bringing to justice the offend ers, and preventing a repetition of the Crimea. No means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investiga tion of the alleged crimes, and to secure the conviction and just punishment of the guilty. It ia to be observed that the principal appropriation made for the Department of J ustice at the last session contained the fol lowing clause: " And in defraying the ex penses which may be incurred for the en forcement of the act approved February 28, 1871, entitled ' An act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870, entitled an act to en force the rights of the United S'.ates to vote in the several States of the Union, and for other purposes,' or any act amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." It is the opinion of ihe Attorney Gen eral that the expense of the proceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and rely confidently upon Congress to make adequate appropriations to enable the Executive Department to en force the laws. I respectfully urge upon your attention that the Congressional elections, in every district, in a very important sense, are justly a matter of political interest and con cern throughout the whole country. Each State, every politieal party, is entitled to the share of power which ia conferred by the legal and constitutional suflrage. It is the right of every citizen, possessing the qualifications prescribed by law, to cast one unintimidated ballot, and to have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the ;exereise of this power and the enjoyment of this right are common and equal, practically as well as formally, submission to the resulU of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the departments of Gov ernment will feel the true vigor of the pop ular will thus expressed. No temporary or administrative interests of Government, however urgent or weighty will ever dis place the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship. They un derstand that the protection of liberty re quires the maintenance, the full vigor, of the manly methods of free speech, free press, and suffrage, and will sustain the fall authority of Government to enforce the lawa which are framed to preserve these es timable righ's. The material progress and welfare of the States depend on the pro tection afforded to their citizens. There can be no peace without such protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole country is deeply interested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts. While the country has not yet reached complete nnity of feeling and reciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and so seriously entangled, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and with increasing force. The power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional or State attachments, in demanding that all over our wide territory ihe name and char acter of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and re spect. OI R FOREIGN KKLATIONS. Our relations with other countries con tinue peaceful. Our neutrality in contests between foreign powers has been main tained and respected. The Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer has been attended by large numbers of our citizens. The brief period allowed for the preparation and ar rangement of the contributions of our citizens to this great Exposition was well employed in energetic and judicions efforts to overcome this disadvantage. These ef forts led and directed by the Commissioner General, were remarkably successful and the exhibition of the products of American industry was creditable and gratifying in scope and character. The reports of the United States Commissioners, giving its re sults in detail, will be duly laid before you. Our participation in this international com petition for the favor and the trade of the world may be expected to produce useful and important results, in promoting inter course, friendship and commerce with other nations. In accordance with the provisions of the act of February 28, 1878, three commis sioners were appointed to an international conference on the subject of adopting a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing internation ally, the use of the bimetallic money, and securing nxity oi relative viuue ueiwecu those metals. Invitations were addressed to the various governments which had expressed a willing ness to narticipate in its deliberations. The conference held its meetings in Paris ! in August last. The report of the Commis eionera herewith submitted wiil show its results. No common ratio between gold and silver coin could be agreed upon by the Conference. The general conclusion was reached that it is necessary to maintain in the world the monetary functions of silver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other of these two matals, or of both, to be made by each State. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of "$5,500,000 to pay the award of the Joint Commission at Halifax, if, after correspondence with the British Government, on the subject of the conform ity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question thereby submitted to the commission, the President shall deem it his duty to make the payment, communications upon these points were addressed to the British Gov ernment through the legation of the United States at London. Failing to obtain the concurrence of the British Uovernment in the views of this Government respecting the award, I have deemed it my duty to tender the sum named within the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a no tice of the grounds of the payment, and a protest against any other construction of the same. The correspondence upon this subject will be laid before you. The Spanish Government has officially announced the termination of the insurrec tion in Cuba, and the restoration of peace throughout that island. Confident expecta tions are expressed of a revival of trade and prosperity, wmcn it is earnestly nopea may prove well founded. Numerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of properity, have been among the incidents of the long-continued hos tilities. Some of these claims are in process of adjustment by Spain, and the others are promised early and careful considera tion. The treaty made with Italy, in regard to reciprocical consular privileges, has been duly ratified and proclaimed. xso questions oi grave importance nave arisen with any other of the European powers. The Japanese Government has been de sirous of a revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as rela-.e to commerce, and, it is understood, has ad dressed to each of the treaty powers a re quest to open negotiations with that view. The United States Government haa been in clined to regard the matter favorably. Whatever restricts ns upon trade with Japan are fonnd injurious to that people, can not but effect injuriously nations hav ing commercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period of seclusion, has within the past few years made rapid atridea in the path of enlightenment and progress, and, not unreasonably, is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which they hold winh each other. A treaty looking to ihis end has been made, which will be submitted for the consideration of the Senate. After an interval of aeveral years, the Chinese Government has again sent envoys to the United States. They have been re ceived, and a permanent legation is now es ' j tablished here by that Government. It is not doubted that this step will be of advan tage to both nations in promoting friendly relations and removing causes of difference. The treaty with theSamoan Is'ands, having been duly ratified and acepted on the part of both governments, is now in operation, and a survey and soundings of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United States, with a view of its occupation as a naval station, if found desirable to the service. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations with Mexico, correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two Governments upon the various auctions which at one time seemed to en danger their relations. While no formal agreement has been reached as to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has done much to remove the sources of dispute, and it is now under stood that a like force of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is also making an energetic movement against the marauding Indian tribes. This Government looks wih the greatest satisfaction upon every evi dence of strength in the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon oun territory. Reluctant to assume any actior or attitude in the control of these incur sions, by military a movements across the border, not impertively demanded for the protection of the lives and property of our own citizens, it shall take the earliest op portunity, consistent with the proper dis charge of this plain duty, to recognize the ability of the Mexican Government to re strain effectively violations of our territory. It is proposed to hold next year an Inter national Exhibition in Mexico, and it is be lieved thatthe display of the agricultural and manufacturing products of the two na tions will tend to better understanding and increased commercial intercourse between their people. With Brazil and the Republics of Central and South America some steps have been taken toward the development of closer commercial intercourse. Diplomatic rela tions have been resumed with Columbia and with Bolivia. A boundray question be tween the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has been submitted by these Governments for arbitration to the President of the United States, and I have, after careful ex amination, given a decision upon it. A naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira Rivers has brought back informa tion valuable both for scientific and com mercial purposes. A like expedition is about visiting the coast of Africa and the Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation to the de velopment of our foreign commerce, have famished many facts that have proved of public interest, and have stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise of our people. SECRETARY OF IHE TREASURY'S REPORT The report of the Secretary of the Treas ury furnishes a detailed statement of the operations of that department of the Government, and of the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $257,763,878.70; the ordinary eqpenditures for the same period, were $236,964,326.70 leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $20,799,551.90. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1879, actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter commencing July 1, 1878, $73,389, 743.43 ; estimated receipts for the remain ing three-quarters of the year, $191,110, 256.5T. Total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $264,500,000. The expenditures for the same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July 1, 1878, act ual expenditures, $73,344,573.27; and for the remaining three quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $166,755, 326.83 making the total expenditures $240,100,000; and leaving an estimated surplus revenue, for the year ending June 30, 1879, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated ac cording to existing laws will be $264,500,000 ; and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same period will be "$236,320,412.68 ; leaving a surplus of $28, 179,587.32 for that year. In the foregoing statements of expendi tures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided for by the act approved February 25, 1862, which requires that one per cent, of the entire debt of the United States shall be purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to be set apart as a sinking fund. There has been, however, a substantial compliance with the conditions of the law. By its terms, the public debt should have been re duced between 1862 and the close of the last fiscal year, $518,361,806.28; the actual re duction of the ascertained debt in that period has been $720,644,739.61 ; being in excess of the reduction required by the sinking fund act 202,282,933.33. Ihe amount of the public debt, less cash in the Treasury, November 1, 1878, $2,024,- 200,083.18 a reduction since the same date last year, of $23,150,617.39. Ihe progress made during the last year. in refunding the public debt at lower rates ot interest, is very gratifying. The amount of four per cent, bonds sold during the present year prior to November 23, 1878, is $100,270,900, and six per cent, bonds commonly known as five-twenties, to an equal amount, have been, or will be re deemed aa calls mature. It has been the policy of the Department to place the four per ceut. bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desires to invest his savings, whether small or great, in these securities, itie secretary or rhe Treasury recommends that the law "i modified that small sums may be inv-i I, and that through the post-offices, or oUitr agents of the Government, the freest opportunity may be given in all parts of the country for such investments. The best mode suggested is, that the De partment be authorized to issue certificates of deposit, of the denomination of ten dol lars, bearing interest at the rate of 3.65 per cent, per annum and convertible at any time within one year after issue into four per cent, bonds authorized by the refunding act, and to be issued only in exchange for United States notes sent to the Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law, supported by suitable regulations, would enable any person readily without cost or rise, to convert his money into an interest bearing security of the United States, and the money so received conld be applied to the redemption of six per cent, bands. The coinage of gold during the laBt fiscal year was $52,798,980. The coinage of silver dollars, under the act passed February 28, 1878, amounted on the 23d of November, 1878, to $19,814,550, of which amount $4.- 984,947 are in circulation, and the balance, $14,829,603, is still in the possession of the Government. With views unchanged with retard to the act under which the coinage of silver pro ceeds, it has been the purpose of the Secre tary laitniuiiy to execute the law, and to afford a fair trial to the measure. In the present financial condition of the country, I am persuaded that the welfare of legitimate business and industry of every description will be best promoted by ab staining from all attempts to make radical change in the existing financial legislation. Let it be understood that during the coming year the business of the country will be un disturbed by governmetal interference with the laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect that the resumption of specie pay ments, which will take place at the ap pointed time, will be successively and easily maintained, and that it will be fol lowed by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity. Let the healing influence of time, the in herent energies of our people, and the boundless resources of our country, have a lair opportunity, ana relict trora present difficulties will surely follow. 

SECRETARY OF WAR. The report of the Secretary of War shows that the army haa been well and economi cally supplied, that our small force has been actively employed, and haa faithfully per SOMERSET, OHIO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, formed all service required of it. The moral of the army has improved, and the number of desertions has materially de creased dnringthe year. Tbe Secretary recommends : 1. That a pension be granted to the widow of the late Lieuter-ant Henry H. Benner, 18th Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer J. M. Chambers, sent with supplies for the re lief of sufferers in the South from that dis ease. 2. The establishment of the annuity scheme for the benefit of tbe heirs of de ceased officers, as suggested by the Pay master General. 3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for the publication of the records of the War of the Rebellion, now being prepared for that purpose. 4. The increase of the extra per diem of soldier-teachers employed in post-schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings for schools and libraries at dif ferent posts. 5. the repeal or amendment of the act of June 18, 1878, forbidding the " use of the army as a. pone comitntus, or otherwise, f ir the purpose of exenting the laws, except in such cases and under such circumstances as may be expressly authorized by the Consti tution or by act of Congress." 6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues of rations, tent and medicines which were made for tbe relief of sufferers from yellow fever. 7. That provision be made for the erec tion of a fire-proof building for the preser vation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed to destruction by fire. These recommendations are all com mended to your favorable consideration. THE NAVY. The Report of the Secretary of the Navy shows that the navy has improved during the last fiscal year. Work has been done on teventy-five vessels, ten cf which have been thoroughly repaired, and made ready for sea. Two others are in rapid progress toward completion. The total expenditures cf the year, including the amount appro priated for the deficiencies f the previous year, were $17,468,392.65. The actual ex penses chargeable to the year, exclusive of these deficiencies, were $13,306,914.09, or $767,199.18 less than those of the previous year, and $4 928,677.74 less than the ex penses, including the. deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381 45 exceeding the ap p'opriations of the present year only $33, 949 75 ; which excess is occasioned by the demands of the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained in the Secre tary's report. The appropriations for the present fiscal year are $14,528,431.70, which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will be ample for all the current expenses of the Department during the year. The amount drawn from the Treasury from July 1 to No vember 1, 1878, is $4 740,544.14, of which $70,980.75 has been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for that period $4,669,563.30, or $520,890.24 less than the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. 

POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S REPORT. The report of the Postmaster-General embraces a detailed statement of the opera tions at the Postoflice Department. The expenditures of that Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were $34, 165,084.49. The net receipts, including sales of stamps, money-order business, and official stamps, were $29,277,515.95. The sum of $290,436 90, included in the forego ing statement of expenditures is chargeable to preceding years, so that the actual ex penditure for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, are $33,874,637 50. The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations, in addition to the revenues of the Depart ment, was $5,308,652.82. The expenditures lor the fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1880, are estimated at $36,571,900. And the receipts from all sources at $30,664,023 90. leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $5,907,876.10. The report calls attention to the fact that the compensation of postmasters and of railroads for carry ing the mails is regulated by law, and that the failure of Congress to "appropriate the amounts required for these purposes does not relieve the Government of responsibil ity, but necessarily increases the deficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to pass. In providing for the postal service the following questions are presented : Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses largely in excess of it revenues, or should such rates of postage be estab lished as will make the Department self sustaining? Should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which aoes not pay its way ? should the number of postal routes be diminished? Should other methods be adopted which will increase the revenues or diminish ex penses of the postal service? 

INTERNATIONAL POSTAGE. The International Postal Congress, which met at Paris, May 1, 1878, and continued in session until Jnne 4 of the same year, was compose of delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. It adopted anew convention, to take the place of the treaty concluded at Berne, October 9, 1874 ; which goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1879, between the countries whose delegates have signed it. It was ratified and ap proved, by and with the consent of the President, "August 13, 1878. A synopsis of this Universal Postal Convention will be found in the report of the Postmaster-General, and the full text in the appendix there to. In its origin the Postal Union comprised twenty-three counties, having a population of three hundred and fifty millions of peo ple. On the 1st of April next it will com prise forty-threecountriesjand colonies, with a population of more than six hundred and fifty millions of people, and will soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries and colonies which maintain organized pos tal service, constituted, in fact as well cs in name, as its new title indicates, a Universal Union, regulating, upon a uniform basis of cheap postal-rates, the postal intercourse between all civilized nations. Some embarrassment has arisen out of the conflict between the customs laws of this country and the provisions of the Postal Convention, in regard to the transmission of foreign books and newspapers to this country by mail. It is hoped that Congress will be able to devise some means of recon ciling the difficulties which have thus been created, so as to do justice to all parties in volved. The business of the supreme Court and of the courts in many of the circuits, has increased to such an extent, during the past years that additional legislation is impera tive to relieve and prevent the delay of justice and possible oppression to suitors, which is thus occasioned. The encumbered condition of these dockets is presented anew in the report of the Attorney General, and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for Congressional action. The crea tion of additional circuit judges, as pro posed, would afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense a', the present rate of salaries of not more than $60,000 a year. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The aonual reports of the Secretary of the Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, present an elaborate account of the present condition of the Indian tribes, and of that branch of the public ser vice wnicn ministers to their interest While the conduct of the Indians, gener ally, has been orderly, and their relations with their neighbors lriendly and peaceful. two local disturbances have occurred, which were deplorable in their character, but re mained, happily, confined to a conipara- tively small number of Indians. The dis content among the Bannocks, which led first to some acts of violence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to the outbreak, appears to have been caused by the insufficiency of food on the reserva tion, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy of the appropria tions, made by Congress, to the wants ot the Indians, at a time when the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. Alter an arduous pursuit by the troops oi the united stales, and several en yauemcnta, the hostile Indians were re duced to subjection, aud the larger part of mem surrenaerea tnemseives as prisoners In this connection, I desire lo call attention to the recommendation made by the Sec retary .of the Interior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of tbe Executive, to be used with proper accountability, at discretion', in sudden emergencies of the Indian service. The ether case of disturbance was that of a band of Northern Cbeyennes who sud denly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their old hunting-grounds, committing mnrders and other crimes on their way. From documents accompanying the report of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly band was as luliv supplied with the necessaries ot life ns the four thousand seven hundred other Iniians who remained quietly on the reser vation, and that the disturbance was caused by men of a restless and mischievous dis position among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole of this band have sur rendered to the mili ary authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that, when some of them had taken refuge in the camp of the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarm ing rumors to the contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly shown ever since the wishes they expressed at the council of September, 1877, had been complied with. Both the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of War unite in the recom mendation that provision be made by Con gress for the organization of a corps of mounted " Indian auxiliaries," to be under the control of the array, and to be used for the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reservations, and preventing or repressing disturbance on their part. I earnest! v con cur in this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a moderate pay from the Government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the Indians by withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment under tbe Government, it be ing a matter of experience that Indians in our service, almost without exception, are faithful in the performance of the duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army in the ac aomplishment of a task which in numeri cal strength is sometimes found deficient. But, while the employment of force for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agencies for the ulti mate solution of what is called the Indian problem. It may be very difficult and re quire much patient effort, to curb the un ruly spirit of the savage Indian to the re strain ts of civilized life, but experience shows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes which are now quiet and orderly and self-supporting were once as savage as any that at present roam over the plains or in the mountains of the far West, and were then considered inaccessible to civilizing influences. It may be impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white pop ulation of the.United States ; but we should not forget that;theyfarejthc aborigines of the country, and called the soil their own on which our people have grown rich, power ful, and happy. We owe it to them as a moral duty to help them in attaining at least that degree of civilizUion which they may be able to reach. It is not only our duty it is also our interest to do so. In dians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest in property, will thenceforth cease to be a wailike and disturbing element. It is also a well authenticated fact that Indians are apt to be peaceable and quiet when their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the expressions of Indians themselves and from many concurring reports, that there is a steady increasing desire, even among Iudians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have their children educated. I invite attention to the reports of the Sec retary of the Interior and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, touching the experiment recently inaugurated, in taking fifty In dian children, boys and girls, from different tribes, to the Hampton Normal Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, where they are to re ceive an elementary English education and training in agricultural and other useful work, to be returned to their tribes, after the completed course, as interpreters, in structors and examples. It is reported that the officer charged with tbe selection of those children might have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possible to make provision for them. I agree with the Secretary of the Interior in saying that " the result of this interesting experiment, it favorable, may be destined to become an important factor in the advance ment of civilization among the Indians." The question, whether a change in the control of the Indian service should be made, was at the last session of Congress, referred to a Committee for inquiry and re port. Without desiring to anticipate that report, I venture to express the hope that in the decision of so important a question. the views expressed above may not be lost sight of, and that the decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to pro duce a disturbing effect upon the service as well ason the Indians themselves. HOT 

SPRINGS COMMISSION. In the enrolment of the bill making ap propriations for sundry civil expenses, at the last session of Congress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. As the Commission had completed the work of taking testimony on the many conflicting claims, the suspension of their labors, before determining the rights of claimants, threatened, for a time, to embarrass the interests, not only of the Government, but alsi of a large number of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on their claims before beginning contemplated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which were ap prehended, and at tbe solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot Springs and others interested in the welfare of the town, the Secretary of the Interior was authorized to request the late Commissioners to take charge of the records of their proceeding, and to perform such work as could properly be done by them under such circumstances, to facilitate the future adiuuication ot the claims at an early day, and to preserve the status of tbe claimants nntil their rights should be finally determined. The late Commissioners complied wiuh that reques", and report that the testimony, in all the cases, has been written out, examined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law. It is recommended that the requisite au thority be given at as early a day in the session as possible, and that a fair com pensation be allowed the late Commissioners lor the expense incurred and labor per formed Dy them since the 25th of J tine last. TIMBER LANDS, AND AGRICULTURE. I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by the Secretary of the Interior with regard to the preservation of the timber on the public lands of the United States. The protection of the pub lic property is one of the first duties of the Government. The Department of the In terior should, therefore, be enabled, by suf ficient appropriations, to enforce tbe laws in that respect. But this matter appears still more important as a question of public economy. The rapid destruction of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially in the mountain ous districts, where the rocky slopes once denuded of their trees, will remain so for ever. There the injury once done can not be repaired. I fully concur with the Secre tary of the Interior in the opinion (or this reason legislation touching the public tim ber in the mountainous Slates and Territor ies of the West, should be especially well considered, and i hat existing laws, in which tbe destruction of the forests is not suffi ciently guarded against, should be speedily modified. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter ot urgent, public necessity, From the organization of the Government the importance of encnuraizinir. by all poa- I sible meant, the increase of our agricultural productions has been ackowledged and 1878. urged upon the attention of Congresa and the people as the surest and readiest means of increasing onr substantial and enduring prosperity. The words of Washington are as appli cable to-day as when, in his eighth annual message, he said : " It is not to be doubted that with reference either to individual er national welfare, agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations ad vance in population and other circumstan ces ot maturity, this truth Decomea more apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported by the public purse and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been employed to this enit, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to en courage and assist the spirit of discovery and improvement, this species of establish ment contributing doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a com mon center the results everywhere of indi vidual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Ex perience accordingly hath shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefit." The great preponderance of the agricul tural over any other interest in the Unit-d States entitles it to all the considera ion claimed for it by Washington . About one half of the population of the United States is engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the United States for the year 1878 is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. The export of agricultural products for the year 1877, as appears from the report of the Bureau of Statistics, was five hundred and twenty four millions of do'lars. The great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own borderr, and by our own labor, not only the necessaries but most of tbe luxuries that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad vantages of soil, climate and intercommuni cation, it appears from the statistical state ments in the report of the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import annually from foreign lands many millions of dollars' worth of agricultural products (which could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture which can only be answered by experiments, often costly, and sometimes fruitless, which are beyond the means of private individuals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It is good policy, especially in times of depression and un certainty in other business pursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage, by every proper and legitimate means, the occupation and tillage of the soil. The efforts of the Department of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new agricul tural industries, to improve the quality and increase the quantity of our products, to determine the value of old or establish the importance of new methods of culture, are worthy of your careful and favorable con sideration, and assistance by such appro priations of money and enlargement of facilities as may seem to be demanded by the present favorable conditions for the growth and rapid development of this im portant interest. The abuse of animals, in transit, is widely attracting public attention. A National Convention of societies specially interested in the subject has recently met at Balti more, and the facte developed, both in re gard to cruelty to animals and the effect of such cruelties upon the public health.would seem to demand the careful consideration of Congress, and enactments of more efficient laws for the prevention of those abuses. 

EDUCATION. The report -of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Education shows very gratifying progress throughout the country, in all the interests committed to the care of this im portant office. The report is especially en couraging with respect to the extension of the advantages of the common school system, in sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of free schools is not yet attained. To education more than any other agency we are to look, as the resource for the ad vancement of the people, in tbe requisite knowledge and appreciation of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and I desire to repeat the suggestion contained in my for mer message in behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures by Congress for the purpose of supplementing, with National aid, the local systems of education in the several States. Adequate accommodations for the great library, which is overgrowing the capacity ot tne rooms now occupieu at ioe vapivui, should be p'ovided without delay. This invaluable collection of books, manuscripts and illustrative art has grown to such pro portions, in connection with the copyright system of the country, as to demand the prompt and careful attention of Congress to save it from injury in its present crowded and insufficient quarters. As this library is national in its character, and must, from the nature of the case, increase even more rapidly in the future than in the past, it can not be doubted that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its usefulness. The anneal of the Regents of the Smith sonian Institution for the means to organize, exhibit and make available for the public benefit the articles now stored away belong ing to the National Museum, I heartily recommend to your favorable consideration 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MATTERS. The attention of Congress is again invited to the condition of the river-front of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance to the health of the residents of the National Capital, both temporary and permanent, that the low lands in front of the city, now subject to tidal overflow, should De reclaimed, in their present condition these flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and are a danger ous source of malarial poison. The re clamation will improve the navigation of the river, by restricting and consequently deepening its channel ; and is also of im portance, when considered in connection with the extension of the public grounds and the enlargement of the park, west aud south of the Washington Monument. The report of the board of survey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress, on the improve ment of the harbor of Washington and Georgetown, is respectfully commended to consideration. The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presenta a detailed statement of the officers of the District. The relative expenditures bv the United States and the District for local purposes is contrasted, showing that the expenditures by the people ot the DMtrict greatly ex ceed those ot the uenerai uovernment. The exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the requisite repair of the de fective pavements and sewers ot the city which is a work of immediate necessity, and. in the same connection, a plan is pre sented for the permanent funding oi the outstanding securities ot the District. The benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions ot tne District are an entitle) to the favorable attention of Congress. Ihe Reform School needs additional buildiu and teachers. Appropriations which wi place all these institutions in a condition to become models of usefulness and benefi ceuce, will be regarded by the country ns liberality wisely bestowed. The Ci-mniiKsioners, with evident justice, request attention to the discrimination made tv CongrcsR against this District in th donation of bind for the support of the pub lic schools, and ask that ihe same liberty that, has neen shown to itie iiiliutmants i the various States Hint Territories of tli Uni'ed States, may be extended to the Ii trict ol l oluiuoia. The t ouiuipuionera alsa invite attentio to the damage inflicted ni on public an private interests bv tbe present location i the depots aud switching tracks of th several railroads entering the citv, and as for legislation looking to their removal NUMBER 35. The recommendations and suggestions con, tained in the report will, I trust, receive tne cirerui consideration ot congress. Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed since the reorganization of the government oi the District, under the recent legislation of Congress, for the expression of a con fident opinion as to its successful operations, but tbe practical results already attained are ao satisfactory that the friends of the new government may well urge upon Con gress the wisdom of i s continuance, with out essential modification, until by actual experience its advantages and defect may be more fully ascertained. R. B. Hayks. . ExECtmvE Mansion, December 2, 1878. Girls Who Want to Marry. There are girls who start out in life with an undefined idea that thev will marry somebody, and then keep looking through the matrimonial market just as they would look through the stock of silks on the shopman's counter. Taking down piece after piece they find the shade of this too dark, or of that too light, or of the other not exactly what they think it ought to be. After put ting tne salesman to mucn trouble they say they will call again, and leave the place not knowing what they want. So the girl who wants to marry looks around to Bee what offers, and finds that this man's beard is too red, that one's eyes too blue, and the otherone'searstoo long. She will look a little farther. She ex amines all that are in the market, and concludes to look farther yet. And when, after having almost unconsciously become a flirt, and having broken the hearts of half the young men in the neighborhood, she keeps on looking a little farther. She finds herself going alone down the hill on the shady side of the way, still with an indefinite longing to marry somebody, and wondering who will come along to propose to her. It would be rash to advise the voting lady to accept the first marrying man who offers. It is equally rash to advise her to wait, and wait, and keep on wait ing, and at last marry nobody. Ferhaps it is not necessary that all should marry. Some of the noblest women in the world are what the world calls old maids; yet that is a lonely way of get ting along. If the girl wants to marry, the young men will find out, and her soul will look out of the windows of her eyes in an unmistakable manner when the right man comes along. And all this without any lack of modesty or breach of perfect decorum on her part. " Old Si " on the Bell flinch. Atlanta Constitution. 1 Old Si knocked his broom against the door jam to clean it of dust, and then turned to remark : Hit 'pears to me dar's er heap er rifflin' an' rufflin' goin' on 'round hyer dat nees 'tention right er wey !" " Why so, old man "Well, dis legislator seems to have dissembled up hyar jess ter make mo' trubble in de Ian' !" " What is it doing now?" " Why, dey's proposin' ter put er law on the statuary books ter kollect der licker tax by dis heah meersheenery box errangement !" " Don't you like that?" "No, sah, dat I don't. Hit moutrht do fer de white folkes, but de nigger can't stand such foolishness. Ebery thing seems ter be settlin' 'ginst the nigger dese days, an' dis bell-punch bizness ar' de wurst form ob de pressher dat we's undergoin' !" " what makes you think so 7" " Kase nigger bar-rooms sells liker fer five cents er glass, an' dis yer 'rangement is gwine ter inflate de price like fury. Hit'll put er perfeckshul lumbargo on de culled serloon enterprizes in dis State ; yer heah me ! Den dey talks 'bout de tax bein' fer eddicashun. but I'se one ob der citerzens dat don't want no licker meeter ringin' er school-bell leckcher on eddicashun ebery time I takes er drink: dat's my han !" And the old man went out to head off the punch. American ts. English Cheese. Not many years ago it would have been considered a palpable illustration of "carrying coals to Newcastle" to undertake to drive the English out of their own markets with American cheese. But that seems to have been threatened if not accomplished, for at a recent agricultural Convention held in England discussion was largely devoted to uie uesk iiieiuiH 01 overcoming compe tition in cheese from this side of the water. That is a source of considerable surprise to the worthy Britons. They never dreamed that Herkimer cheese or even the product of back county Ver mont dairies could hold its own with Stilton and Cheshire, but such is never theless the fact, and they do not know what remedy to apply. One reason why American cheese meets with such a good demand there is its comparative cheap ness. At the same time it lacks none of those qualities which an Englishman knows as well as any other man how to appreciate. Since manufactories be came so numerous in this country the general average of excellence has risen so high that there is no such market as formerly for inferior cheese. It no longer pays to make bad cheese, for Americans will not buy it, there being plenty of good in the market. If Eng land wants to meet this competition she must do as we do, though first her dairy men will have to come to this country and learn how. Snicide to Avoid Bother. It is related of a Chinamen that, hav- iug lost his umbrella, he hanged-himself to avoid the trouble of looking for it. A suicide has just been committed in Paris under circumstances equally ludicrous and melancholy An honest binder, employed more than twenty years in a Rouen house, had been sent up to the fans Exhibition, his expenses being provided out of the .Lottery Fund. The vkmt fellow enioved himself im mensely, and would doubtless have felt grateful ever after to the Administration which had provided him with sodelight- tul an entertainment for nothing. Un happily, however, workmen thus favored are expected to draw up a report of their experiences ior me vonimiiwuiners the LOttery. JNow, the binder had no sooner returned to his native city than his literary labor began to weigh on him like a nightmare. He was afraid he should lie expected to give a full account of all the sections of the lxhilntiou with copious observations of the won drous things contained therein. If he did not do this he was convinced that the Government would sue him for the costa of his trip. It was to no purpose that his comrades tried to cheer him up. and even otfered to compose his report tin mm. fui.n was tne miser able man's name lost his appetite, grew morose and sullen, and one day dis appeared from his home. His body was shortly afterward found in the Seine, Champiok of lijflit weight the coal-dealer. Death From Hydrophobia. Correspondence Cincinnati Enautrer.1 Major Wm. H. Dobb, a prominent citizen of Newcastle, Delaware, died from hydrophobia recently. His suffer ings were intense. He was taken sud denly ill on Saturday, and, although every thing was done to save him, all ef forts were unavailing. Major Dobb was bitten by his own dog, a Newfoundland, about eight weeks' old. The dog was lving before the door, and, in going in, the Major stopped to caress the animal. It did not take li- dly to the petting, however, and finally snapped at Major Dobbs' hand; one finger of the right hand was bitten. The Major immedi ately sucked the wound until it ceased bleeding, and as the wound healed in a day or two he did not fear any serious results. Subset en p. tly the. dog showed symptoms of rabkt, and was shot. The week passed by, and the incident was hardly thought of, especially as the Major had ceased taking elscampe and milk, considering that he was out of danger. On Saturday morning he went to the hydrant and drew a glass of water. W hen he placed the goblet to his lips, however, he found it impossible to force a drop down his throat. He threw the water away and went into breakfast, a cup of coffee was placed by his plate and he attempted to drink it, but in vain. " It has come at last," he said, and arose from the table. A physician was sent for, and on his arrival found the Major calm and composed, but firmly believing there was no help for him. He drank a little beer during tlie day. He grew worse, and any unexpected noise would cause a cold tremor to run over him. By noon he grew delirious and his convulsions increased, and they grew stronger and stronger, and several men were brought into his room to hold him. Once he broke away from them and tried to jump from the window, bnt was restrained before he could leap out. He frequently tried to drink in his more rational moments, and his efforts to force liquid down his. throat are de scribed as terrible. His eves would seem to burst from their sockets, and his strong frame shivered in every part. During the night Major Dobbs suffered most indescribable agonies, and at 2:49 in the morning, in the midst of a con vulsion, death came to his relief. Ihe deceased leaves a wife and two sons and two daughters. He was over sixty years of age, and was born in England. During the war he was an Engineer in the navv. Newcastle is thoroughly alarmed on the Jog question now. It is said that the same dog that caused Major Dobbs's death also bit another person. Several dogs were killed and others are being muzzled. Casting out Devils. A wealthy farmer, much affected with hypochondria, came to Laugenau, to consult Michael Scuppach, better known by tbe appellation ot the Mountain Doctor. "Iheve seven devils in my belly," said he; " no fewer than seven." There are more than seven," rer plied the doctor, with the utmost gravity; "if you count them right, you will find eight." After questioning the natient concern ing his case, he promised to cure him in eight days, during which time he would every morning rid mm ot one ot nis troublesome inmates, at the rate ot a louis d'or for each. ' But," added he, " as the last will be more obstinate and difficult to expel than the others, I shall expect two louis d'ors for him." The farmer agreed to these terms : the barpain was struck, and the doctor, im pressing upon all present tne necessity of secrecy, promised to give the nine louis d ors to the poor of tne parisn. The next -morning the imaginary de moniac was brought to him, and placed ear a kind of machine which he had never seen before, bv which means he re ceived an electric shock. The farmer roared out lustily. " Inere goes one : said the doctor, with the utmost gravity. .Next day the same operation was re peated. The farmer bellowed as before, and the doctor coolly remarked . " Another is ou ! In this manner he proceeded to the seventh. When he was preparing to attack the last, Scuppach reminded his patient that he now had need ot all his courage, for this was the captain of the gang, who would make a more deter mined resistance than any ot tne otners. The shock was at this time so strong as to extend the demoniac on the floor. " Now they are all gone ! said the doctor, and ordered the farmer to be put to bed. Ou recovering himself, the latter de clared he was completely cured ; he paid the nine louis d'ors, with abundance of thanks, and returned in the best piriu . to the village. Credible witnesses attest this extraordinary cure, wtucn prove the acuteness of "the doctor, aa well as the truth of Solomon's proverb, that with the fool we must sometimes talK like a fooL The fipe in Turkey. In Turkey tobacco and pipes are not merely the distinctive tokens of differ ent ranks. A marshal would think it altogether unsuitable to smoke with a pipe shorter than two ells, while the handicraftsman, or the official of a lower order, would be deemed presumptuous if his pipe-stem transcended ue meas ure of that habitual with his class. The grandee, in contact t contrast with a man ot low degree, can paraae nis pipe to its full length ; but the man of low degree, modestly thrusting aside or con cealing his pipe, must not show more of it than Uie mouthpiece wnicn ne noias in his hand. The pasha can, like the chimney of a steamer, throw forth clouds of smoke, but the subordinate must allow only .small circles or amoKe light as zephyrs, to flow from his lips, and he must so contrive that the smoke does not go in front of him, but turns backwards. In the presence ot a grandee, not to smoke is regarded as a testimony of respect. This sign of respect a son is likewise expected to snow to nis latner. and a well-trained and well-mannered son is that one regarded who, in spite of the repeated lequest of nis latner, re fuses to smoke. The funeral of the infamous Marat, assassinated by Charlotte Corday, was celebrated in Paris, July 17. 1793, with the greatest solemnity. All tne sections joined the procession. Four women bore the bathing machine in which Marat was standing when he was assas sinated ; his shirt, stained with blood, was carried by a fury, in the shape of a woman, at the top of a pike. After this followed a wooden bedstead on which the corpse of Marat was carried by citi zens. His head was uncovered, and the gash he had received could be easily distinguished. The procession was paraded through teveral streets, and was saluted on its march by several dis charges of artillery. Two old Scotch topers were found by a friend, after the fourteenth tumbler, gripping one another by the hand while maudlin tears ran down their cheeks. When they were asked the cause of their grief, one of them exclaimed, " Eh, mou, we're just grt'etiu' owre tbe sair burden o the National debt!" SKOlKiBASSsay that two young ladies kik-smg each other is iike an emblem of Christianity, because they are doing to each other as they would uif u sbeuld do unto them. 1
