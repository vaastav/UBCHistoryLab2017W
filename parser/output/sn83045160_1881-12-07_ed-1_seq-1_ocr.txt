We publuh on the second page of this morning' Appial a full and carefully edited report of the first Message of Presi de m Arthur. It U a very conservative doccment, and deals frankly with the gen erI iut rests of the country and it home and foreign policies. Among hi recommend tion which particularly interest the people of this part of the Union are those favoring a liberal appropriation for the improvement of the MieHisippi; tbe application of the money received from the (ales of the public lands to iJucatioctl pnrpcees, according to the illiteracy of each State; the ontpiiig up of so much tf the Ipdiaa Terribly ag j8 not occupied by fie Inliane, and the allotments p peclfic j auiount of Japd to th red mua with a view to compel the adoption of civilized ways, lie alsj recouimend the re lease ot alion il bank from all taxe in view of the reduction of the rate of iutercst on the bonds dopoitcd by them for circula tion, the abolition of the stamp on bank check ad. matche, and other pro prietary tlamps, and indorse tho ro cmmendation of the Secretary of the Treas ury, the payment of the arrears of pension permitting, to abolish all internal revenue ave that derived from whisky and tobacco. He opposes the disturbance of the bond uu les a lower rate (three per cent.) of interest can be secured, and he urges economy in every department of the Gov ernment, lie endorses all of the recoui nuudalion.1 of the Postmaster General and is very ean'hu'.'.c in hi aurance of hi purpose to prosecute the Star-route robbers to punirhment. He alto urges that the navy be strengthened by additional ships, and that tho army be ip'resed up to thirty thousand service men. He is earnest in hi condemnation of polygamy and for a mean f ,t its suppression, prease civil-service form a a necessity of the times, and favors a revUion of the turiff. lit devotes esprcial attention to our foreign lelation and nfera with pride to the cordially friendly feeling ex isting between our country and England. His reference to the assassination of Garfield is brief, but in good taste. He congratulate the people on the general prosperity, and t - he peace and good will which prevail at li yaoiue and abroad, and promise to see that the laws are enforced and administered in a tew sugges ts Message we cannot it ho nt any t oed as to the expense, or any ucsire to retuperal tbrtustlve at tne cxpen.-e of thiir friends. If this doe not put h o;, manly fieldjsport in its proper tight before the masse nothing else wiiL The Anglo-Saxon argument is ,-Put up, or hut op;'' but among true, generous sports men, such a meet at these trial-, there,' s no uch argument. They did not come here with any view of vindicating their own faulty idea by bluff, but simply to see which of many good dogs was the best, for the sole object of furthering their own and each others' pleasnres in the field. The National Auericin Kennel Club is a body to promote the het interests of field dog breeding, which it thinks it can do better by generous rivalry than by betting. The nomination for the alt-aged and brace stake look place at the hotel, and there were twenty-five would-be champion willing to pay twenty-five dollar for the honor of con tending. Getting well away we got to work at 9:05 a.m., with Adair and Shadow the third brace in tbe second round, when Adair again struck her terrific gait and rang, running all over the country at once; but she was poorly in hand, and her head strong rushes at last led her into a flush and chase that beat all her elegant pointing. The next brace were Gertie and Mark LT, rck, who for a long time ran, undecided, the bitch raiiin; and quartering better, but cn Coding birds Gertrude ontworked the dog handily and in good style, and won her heat. The third round began with Bessie and Dashing Novice; and now began a very tedious affair, for there were no birds to find for a very long time. The threatening weather and high wind had evidently driven them from their usual haunts, so that the care ful marking of those who had had the game in charge was virtually lost. Bessie, too, was entirely off, and showed none of the speed, dash and style which aided her in de feating Glida yesterday morning and Lon don last evening. In addition to this she was either too kiea of nose or not in nose at allt a she false-pointed twice, and only moved away on the approach of her handler. Nov ice, however, was in fine form, working in dastrionsly, steadily and well, but with poor success, lor alore-mentioned reasons. At last we thought we had them, but it was only a stand on a frtth roost, no bird. Moving on, Bersie again made a half- false point. After a long interval of weary walking a good covey was passed by careless handling and flushed by the j'.iages. On these some scattered good work was gotten, but not enough, seemingly, to d.ciJe the question a momentous one, for the winner of this heat was fairly sure of some monev. A halt was now called for lunch, and during it the judges held a consultation which le sulted in Novice winning. Genie and Shadow were next put down, and Gertie showed a better turn of speed, though in ranging and quartering they proved a very level brace, as all through. Shadow got first blood by a grand point; Dew forcing her forward and causing her to be unsteady when birds flushed. Sanborn, by clever handling, got credit for a back. Trying back on scattered birds, Gertie got a neat point, grandly backed by Shadow, who shortly after made a nice point down wind, on to the spot whence the bird had just flashed. Shtdow, again coming down wind, made a flush and in clined to chase till Sjcalled to order, but the judge perhaps did not see it. Then Shadow pointed a covey of runner that flushed forty yard ahead. While Gertie was pottering over a stale scent Shadow crossed the valley and made good a fine point on the opposite hill, winning the heat. In the fourth round Dishing Novice went down with Shadow for first money, and Novice got to work quickly with a false point, waich may have been creditable, as, though no bird was found, "the woods were full of them" just previously. Getting iuto the open Novice showed superior speed and range. Ranging wide up the hill into Uie wood, she got a beautitul point on a covey, which was finely backed by Shadow, whose backing waa simply superb. Going away from this on a long round, tbey at last found a covey. Shadow roading, and Novios, swinging ahead, took the icent breast-bi&B and made a handsome point ahead of Shadow; bird flushed themselves wildly, Crossing the ravine, Shadow drew on birds, and at the same time Novloe pointed, and Shadow backed her stand, Shadow being a Ui. fle unsteady when bird-: fluat- ' then had , . TheiuiSea - tong consultation and brought the bitchc out even, by which It 1 evident that tfcey wore th,aa. we did. On renewing the race each Jroaded up the same covey, and separately pointed part of it; both flushed nd chased. Moving on again on scattered b-j-J Novice got a beautiful point well backed, on a aiog'e bird, which being Gushed both dropped wing; moving ten feet Novice got another point and won tho Dog Uerby ot 1S81. lhe j'ldges.theu consulted aa to tbe best dog previously beaten by Novice, according to rule, to run agaiust Shadow for second money, which was decided to be Bessie and Pollux, and they were accord ingly limed down at 4 p.m. Bessie im proved somewhat on her morning's run with Novice, but she was Hot in good fix snd should have been beaten by Pollux if he at tended less to roading birds up and more to thewishcsof the judges,which was to have him back, but he was after birds and took no notice of the pointing bitch on two separate occa sions, which beat him, though his smartness aa a brisk dog and cn scattered bird was fairly well established on difficult ground.

Special to the Appeal. I Nashville, Tens., December 6. About seventy-five member of the Legislature have arrived, and both houses will have a quorum to-morrow. The Governor will send a special message having reference to the object for which the session was called. The general impression prevails that the Legislature will not increase the representa tion in the House to ninety-nine and the Senate to thirty-three, for the reason it is believed that it is not necessary; that it would be expensive and the bodies would be cumbersome. It is also thought an increase should not be made until the population of the Stale reaches two millions. tub 100-3 CASE. The Supreme Court has given tliree hours for argument iu the 100 ' case next Monday. WILL BB BEBCILT AT 05.XE. The shops of the penitentiary will be re built at once. Workmen commenced clear iug away the dehru to-day. The buildings will be built the same distance apart, with especial reference to selling them a indus trial establishments in event the removal of the penitentiary could be decided upon. The Governor would have issued a proclamation asking the Legislature to make an appropriation of $10,000 but for the fact that Cherry, O'Connor & Co. volunteered to furnish the inspectors a sufficient amount to replace the buildings. He will probably em brace this and the question of the removal of the penitentiary in his proclamation call ing a special session to redUtrict the State for Congressional representation. CAUSE OF THE Ft EE. Cherry, O'Connor & Co. were insured for $09,000. The inspector investigated, the cause of the fire and found it to have been altogether accidental, a convict having drop ped a piece of hot iron in a tub of pitch. XLYIITII C0XGUESS.

The Directors of the New York and New England Railroad have organized and elected the following otucers: i'reaident, Jaiuts li. itsou: ireas urer, George D. Miippcu; Secretary, James . reruns; r.xecutive iommitiee, Jay on Id, lgrand li. I anon, Jonas 11. trench William T. Hart, and June 11. Wilson. Last night, in accordance with a previous announcement in the Appeal, Mr. -h.mil Lindburz delivered a short address on the subject of immigration at the courthouse. ihe speaker uas liad lonir experience with the sutiiect, and he has come to the South expecting to find here a home for those who have tired ot tne barren land and tne crowded countries of Europe. The point enforced bv Mr. Lindburg in hi address were as follows: We do not, he said, come to this country because of any feeling of patriotism, nor dots charity urire us; but it is merely a matter of business with us. We have an idea that the South is now the great field for -u anj w;(jj reasonable encouragement, we will bring here our skill, our industry and our brain. We have brought a great many people to tho Northwest, and, in spite of the sterile land aud the hard winters, we have suc ceeded. In no single Instance have we failed. We have arrangements with t. steamships and railroads bv " bring E'4roiian fc ..ncn we can -ere at greatly reduced 1 don't intend to make any display of oratory, but to speak plainly, practically, ana to tlie point. In S-j0 Northwest began to be the obiec- tive point of immigration. Since then there has been a great transformation; cities have sprung up, the wild savage has disappeared and law reigns. Population and capital have done all this. Central and Northern Missouri waa populated mainly bv emierantg from Kentucky and Tennessee, and the foster child may be said to have outstripped it arsnis. The great State of Tennessee, with all its splendid resources, offers great inducements to tlie immiiiraiit. Ihe bouth is an immense depository of stores of wealth, and if immi gration is invited and encouraged it will certainly come. I read a short time ago an article in a prominent Eastern paper on the subject of immigration, which stated as a reason that more foreigners did not come South, that life aud property were not safe Here. 1 apers in the Northwest have made simitar statements, and the European pa- IerH have taken up the same idea. which we know to be untrue. The ay for the South to refute these falsehoods is to live them flown. The South has never uttered a falsehood or the truth about the matter. When the people of Eu rope know that this part of the country is healthy, that the land is teitile, that law and the rights of property are grounded on deep aud lasting foundations, then they will not ue-itate to come here. 1 tie treat uustacie to immigration arise from the fact that the large landholder will not sell, ile thinks that it immigration la coming he will hold on to bis land, and will thus be enhanced in value. Now, if he would sell half his land for small farms he would get the actual value of the land fold aud the land retained would really become more valuable than all he had before. All, llitn.we ask is that you will deal reasonably with the immigrants. Sell them land at fair prices, aud don't put the highest figure on the articles they need. We don't ask alms; we merely want encouragement aud fair play. The speaker concluded his address by sug gesting lhat some oi ihe citizens meet to gether and appoiut committees to watch iui uiigratiuu and tacilitate iu Washington, December 6. The Senate met at noon and appointed a committee to wait on the President and notify him of their readiness to receive his message.

Senator Maxey forwarded to the Secretary and had read a resolution he had prepared of similar import. SenatorGarland said the subject was an important one, and suggested that a day be fixed for its discussion. Senator Beck favored prompt action, and incidentally remarked that his resolution was almost identical with the one prepared by Senator Crittenden in 185G.

He also declared his intention to vote to re tain all the present officers. This is divid ing the patronage of the Senate, by giving the Democrats the offices and the Republicans the committees. The Signal Service. A bill will soon be introduced in Congress for the betterment of the Signal service. It provides for the increase of officers and men, and for the appointment by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, of three professor and thir teen assistant professors, preference being given to those persons of high scien tific attainments, especially in the science of meteorology, who, by long service in the Sig nal service and in the service of the United Stales, have shown peculiar fitness for mete orological and allied scientific work. The Proposed Sw Territory. It is evident that the Republicans are de termined to push the matter of the admis sion of Southern Dakota into the Union. Senators Windom and Saunders have intro duced bills for this purpose, both being sub stantially the same, except that Saunders proposes to name that part of Da kota left as a Territory "Pem bina," and Windom proposes to name it North Dakota. Saunders is chairman of the Committee on Territories, and all bills of this character will go into his hand.i. The Democrats intend to fight the measure, and the chances are its fate in the Senate will depend upon the view David Davis takes of the question. In Kejfard to the Horns Committees. Mr. Keiftr told the Western Associated Press reporter to-night that he had begun to collect information and data for the forma tion of committees, but had only just begun, and lhat neither himself nor any liv iug man could siy who would get various chairman-hips. Represents live Gib son says that the it-port that the Louisiana Legislature, at its coming special session, will have to again select a successor to Sena tor Kellogg, because the former election of Gibson is invalidated by the calling of the special session, is not correct. He Bays his election was in accordance with the law, and another session of the Legislature doea not interfere. alow the Message was Received. The President's message was received with satisfaction and commendation. There waa some disappointment expressed in some quarters that he did not more distinctly aud definitely enumerate a policy. This feeling, however, seems to be confined to those who hope for the domination of a faction of the parly. The Republicans generally think that the President means to entirely ignore the faction and to heal dissensions, and are glad he refrained from saying anything that could be seized upon by either taction. Western li -publicans, es prciaily those from the silver-producing State, are not pleased at the recommenda tion to limit silver coinage, but they console themselves with the belief that Congress will not carry out that recommendation. Cabinet Talk. It can be definitely and authoritatively stated that Secretary Hunt will retain his Cabinet position, and James will remain at the head of the Postoffice Department until the end of the present fiscal year. James, when questioned to-night, admitted that he is to remain until the eud of next June, and Lincoln also admits that he will remain. It is reported to-night that Kirk wood has also beea informed by the President that he de sires him to remain. A Western Senator in formed the Associated Press reporter to-night that Kirkwood will remain. Hunt, it is said, will probably stay awhile to eventually make room tor Longstreet. I' reltnghnvsen auu Brewster are to he Secretary of Attorney-General, and - - an(j Ken tilled . .c ireasury havinrr , .is make up the complement of me aoinei. Tlie Cause of Clerk Lamphere's Dls-t-hnrire. It appears now that Ex-Appointment Cleik Aleck Lamphere, of the Treasury, who was recently discharged under circum stances very unfavorable to hira, put a slight upon David Davis some months ago. Davi obtained for a young lady from North Carolina a transfer from the Bu reau of I 'rioting and Engraving to the Treasury, aud before she had been there long Lamphere discharged her, telling her that she was a Southern woman and a rebel, and that was cause enough with him for her discharge. Lam phere then refused to pay any respect to Davis's request for the lady's retention, say ing Davis had no influence now. Lamphere is out of a job, and Davis has considerable inuuence. Virtually Settled for Two Years. Senator Davis's speech to-day is regarded as ss'ttling, for the next two years, the status of the Senate offices, unless death should make a change, giving the Republican party a positive mtjonty. hen referring to his acceptance of the position of Prtsidcnt of the Senate, iu his speech to-day, Senator Davis manifested considerable indignation In alluding to various newspaper insinua tions that he had sold himself to the Repub licans, he was very emphatic in reasserting that not a sim;!e word tending to commit him to the Republicans passed between him and them prior to his occupation ot the po sition. His speech has rendered Uie Senate ethcers and employes h appy. The bill introduced by Seuator Kellogg in the Senate for the establishment of a United States ocean and mail service and the revival of foreign commerce in American steamships is a copy of the bill introduced in January last by Secretary Blaine. W.snistiTow, December 6. Upon the ope .lug of curt this morning, Guiteau an nouj. ed thai he had prepared an order for the attendance of witnesses. He suggested Saturday, and would desire the court to sign it at once. The order was handed Judge Dox, rnd Scoville called ,

FARWELL, nirtu'. . i of Congress, irom Chicago, took the stand, and was questioned upon the feelings between the factions of the Republican party j'ist previous to the shooting of Presi dent Garfield. Judge lVrler objected to taking np the time of the cviri by this kind of evidence. Witnets wkj questioned as to his acquaint ance with th.- i n oner. He stated that the prisoner li - i upon him (witness) at his office in t-hi.-igo, and, showing him some newspaper l'p, said he was about to pur chase th hilrr Omm, snd told witness if he would lo in h'ni S'JOO.OOO he would make itim I.i!"!-1 Pie-ideiit of the United Stales. Guit'.cu (empiia ically) That is false. I never made any nueu proposition. 1 asked him to invest a. uie money in the enterprise, but he said he had already put $10,000 into the liUer-Oretin, and would not put in any more. Witness aiin saw the prisoner in this city in March la.-t. The prisoner had a recom mendation (or the Pari consulship, and war.ted witness to sign it. Witness never tboagbt the prisoner a Bane man. I pun tho cross examination witness was asked if, in the conversation mentioned, he had anv oi-po'.tuuity to form an opinion whether the pri-oner was able to distinguish betwen right and wrong. Mr. Scovilla obj -cted to the question, and argued at great length in Bupport of his ob- ectiiD. Uuiu nil continually broke in and ltisi-ted that the qurs'ion had no bearing on the C4.-I ; that his mind all through was blaik on the qu:s ion of right and wrong; thai he was l in , - 1 1. i by an inspiration which l e i. mild not resist.

I acted from inspration." Judge Cox Well, that will do, prisoner. You have said that a great many times aud you must not interrupt the court again. GORHAM who qualified and gave $500,000 bond.

Turning to Scoville, he said: "You are retting a little cracked yourself on this subject. I won't have your line of defense. It n altogether too narrow." Gorham was told to step down, when Guiteau shouted out: "Come back, Mr. Gor hau; I want to ask you a few questions. I want you to state whether you did not write and publish in the last part of May and Junt a great many bitter articles denounc ing President liar held for wrecking the Re publican party." Mr. Gurham 1 decline to answer that question unless ordered by court. The file of tie Republican speak for themselves. Judge Cox iou can pro luce the hies, Mr. Prisoner, but yoH cannot compel the witness to state what the files contain. Guiteau Very well, Mr. Gorham; I shall hav you on the stand later, with your files. I propose to show how your paper denounced the President for disrupting the Republican party. Guiteau, at Scoville's suggestion, then read a chapter from his book Truth, which set forth the trials and teaching of St. Paul, elaborating as he read. "That s my case exactly," said Guiteau, "that's just the way I tried to preach the gospel." Shortly after ward the prisoner became involved in an angry altercation with Scoville, in the course of which he became very violent, and de nounced him aa "no politician and no law yer. You insinuated yourself upon the de fense just because you happened to be my brother-in-law," said Guiteau. Judge Portt-r undertook to address the court, when Guiteau shouted, imperiously, "Now, you jait keep quiet, Mr. Judge Por ter; you are altogether too talkative this morning." Scoville stated that he desired to have President Arthur testify in the case. Guiteau, interrupting, "Yes, and Grant and Conk ling, and the rest of my political friend. Scoville, here, takes altogether a too narrow view of this case." Scoville, continuing, said he madeevtry effort to secure the Priesdent's attendance, but without success. It was absolutely essential to obtain his testimony. After some discussion, counsel for I lis prosecution agreed to allow Scoville to pr. pare interrogations to be submitted to the President, and allow his evidence in this form to be put in later. Scoville stated that, with this exception, the defense had con cluded. Guiteau, excitedly I want that order signed. Jud;e. Judge Cox I fail to see the necessity for summoning the witness you have named, and shall therefore refus; the order, Mr. Pris oner. Guiteau Then I note an exception. Ri porter, put that down. Scoville then produoetl Uutteau' bon Truth, whiclt had been put in e"!J not yet read to the in bu( Guitean - " J. ' . Mr. Scoville, you read like a scnoolboy; you don't put any spirit into it. Let me read. Guiteau then began reading. He apolo gized to the audience by way of preface by saying: "Lndie and gentlemen, I have not ad any practice tor so long that my voice may be a little husky. I will, however, do the best I can. I hope you will give your attention. You will fiud some interesting reading." Confusion ensued in the rear of the court-room, which greatly annoyed Guiteau, and he appealed letulently to Judge Cox, saying: "1 must ave order in this room or I cannot be heard. Then turning partly round to the audience, It any one wants to go out let them go out now, but you must keep order. Thirty minutes were occupied in reading, and when the hour for recess arrived, the counsel for the prosecution objected to the reading of the entire book, and after discussion it was arranged that latterly Mr. Sco- llle should mark such passage a he intends to rely upon or touch upon in his argument, and submit them back to the irosecution to-morrow. With this under standing and agreement between the counsel relative to the evidence of President Arthur. Scoville announced the close of the defense. At the request of Colonel Cork hill, the court ad journeu until to-morrow, when the prosecu tion win introduce their evidence in rebut tal. ' 

HOLLAND. The Hague, December 6. The Second Chamber of the States-General passed tbe foreign office estimates by a vote of CO to 3, after a desultory debate on the Borneo question. It was closed by a declaration from the Government that, considering the satisfactory declarations of England, it could not assume the responsibility of creating difficulties on a question concerning which the Deputies themselves differed widely. GERMANY. Be t i.in, December 6. In the Reichstag to-day, during a debate in committee of the whole on the bill for the incorporation of Hamburg in the Zollverein, considerable ex citement arose on account of an attack on Windlhorst, tbe German Gazette accusing him of having raised the question in com mitt.'e whether England and Russia would not oppose the incorporation of the lower Elbe, and insinuating that he had been the mouthpiece for foreign agents in the matter. Windthorst declared that he only desired to prevent any such question from being raised abroad by eliciting a declaration irom tbe committee on the point. Ihe at tack upon him, he said, was based upon prejudice. Mr. Bitler declared he had nothing to do either with this report or with the article in the Sorth German Gazette. The Germania, Ultramontane organ, charac terizes the article as a semi-official calumny. In consequence of what is regarded as an in- su to meir lender tne members oi tne cen ter Tty resolved to be absent from the Bis-niarc- oiree Tuesday. ENGLAND. London, December 6. Dempsey, proprie tor of the Ultfer Examiner and Northern Star, has retired from the contest in the election for member of Parliament for Londonderry to fill the vacancy caused by the promotion of Hugh Law to be Chancellor of Ireland. This action is in obedience to the voice from Kilmainham. The purifying-house of the Birkenhead gasworks exploded this morning. No loss of life, but the explosion created a great panic, hundreds of persons rushing into the street. The Timrx, in an editorial, say the Czar and the Emperor Francis Joseph will cer tainly meet. Tobin, arrested at Bradford, will be tried en the charge of treason and felony. The Government intends to identify Tobin with the Fenian and Irish brotherhoods. In consequence of the British demands, the Porte has instituted a commission on re forms in Armenia. Five thousand families are affected by the strike of the nail makers of Rowley and Cradley. The Grand Lodge of Master Masons last night passed a resolution of condolence with Mrs. Garfield. The resolution was moved by Ixird Henniks snd seconded by Prince Leopold. AUSTRIA. Vienna, December 6. A correspondent of the London Standard, in a letter to his paper, vouches for the authenticity of the follow ing: "Some time back Russia sounded Italy in regard to joint action against AuBtria. Italy received tlie proposals favorably, and preparations were actually begun to repeat the events of I860, with the exception that Ru.-sia was to play the part which Prus sia then performed, but the scheme became known to the Austrian and German Govern ments, and Bismarck accordingly arranged the Dantzic interview. When Italy per ceived that an Austro-German alliance would be able to withstand an Austro-Rus-sian conflict, she resolved to attain her ends with Ihe help of Austria. Italy, believing that Austria cherished important designs in the east of Europe, and would consent to transfer Trentino or some other part of Italia Irredenta in order not to be disturbed in the East, instructed the Count DeRabitant, Italian Ambassador at Vienna, to suggest an interview between King Humbert, and iMU peror i rancis Joseph as preliminary " alliance.
