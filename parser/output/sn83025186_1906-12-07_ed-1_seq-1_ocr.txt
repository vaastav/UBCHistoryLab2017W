EDITORALS. The annual message sent from the president to the opening ses sion of Congress, which convened in Washington,J[). C., last Mon day, was read Tuesday. The document is of the usual length as is generally necessary in order to acquaint the American Con gress with things which need their immediate attention. There was 26,000 words in the message dealing in a clear and compre hensive manner with the aurrent questions and problems of the day. We agree with him in most of the questions he discussed and especially do we agree with him on the potion he took- in the Japan and San Francisco school question, and the position he took in condemning lynching in this country. It is a very strong appeal to law and order and true manhood. It is published else where and will speak for itself. While we have censured Presi dent Roosevelt for the treatment of the colored battalion in Texas, yet we are always willing to com mend the good he does. If soy man or ruler makes a mistake thinking he is right, with an honest intent, we ought to be reasonable and broadminded enough to forgive, for man is not perfect nor his acts.
