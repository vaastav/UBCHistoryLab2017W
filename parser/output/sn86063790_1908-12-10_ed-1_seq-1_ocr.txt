Prominent Catholic Killed. St. Louis, December 8.?Francis D. Hirschberg, prominent in the Ro? " 1' - ??<! o tuirannal I man uamonc cuua-u auu a pVi OVTUM4 friend of Archbishop Glennon, also well known in club and business circles and as a director of the Louisiana Purchase exposition, was shot and killed at his home early to-day. Whether it was murder or suicide has not been determined. A trail of blood stains on the stairway indicated that Mr. Hirschberg was shot at the foot of the stairs and then turned and walked back to his bed room on the second floor. From there he crossed a hallway and passed through his wife's room to the bath room. He returned and staggered into his wife's room. Mrs. Hirschberg says she woke just in time to see him sink to the floor un-. conscious. He died soon afterwards without making a statement as to how he was shot. As far as the police can learn no member of the household was on the lower floor of the house at the time of the shooting. Mrs. Hirschberg is deaf, and therefore she did not hear the report of the revolver. Mrs. Hirschberg is a sister of Lady Noblesworth, wife of an English peer. There are no children. A minute survey of the premises by the police failed to reveal any signs of the entrance of any intruder. All looks and bolts were found secured. Democracy Stronger. Washington, December 8.?"I do not think the leaders of the Democratic party were cast down by defeat and if they are right, as I think they are, they will win eventually." Thus Gov. John A. Johnson of Minnesota expressed in an interview his abiding faith in Democracy. *T think the Democratic party is in better position than it was before the campaign opened. I am, of course, unable to say what caused the result to be what it was. - Mr. Bryan was much misunderstood, ' and was purposely misrepresented; there was a lack of organization in the Democratic party and unity of organization in Republican ranks. Then it is always so much easier for the party in power to win." Fight Against River. Pine Bluff, Ark., December 8.?Apparently the fight against the encroachment of the Arkansas river toward the eastern residential section of this city has been won and with the water rapidly receding it is believed that the most serious phase of the present flood is past. When the government dyke was swept away yesterday work was sus- j pended at the shops of the Cotton Belt railroad and officials and employees alike joined the residents in a systematic effort to stop the ravages of the rushing waters in East Bend. Their efforts were successful and while several squares west of Harding bayou caved in, the crumbling to-night has ceased at this line and it is not believed that the water can encroach farther. Road's Engines Attached. Savannah, Ga., December 8.?The only two locomotives owned by the Savannah, Augusta & Northern railway were attached to-day, the attachment for over $13,000 having been issued for the American Locomotive company. One engine was locked down at Statesboro by the sheriff of the county and the other lies on its back near Aaron, Ga., where it has been since the killing of Engineer A. R. Rephard on Sunday. 

TRICK DIDN'T WORK. Two Strangers Attempt to "Short Change" Bamberg Merchant. Two "slick" strangers arrived in town on the six o'clock train last Saturday afternoon, and an hour or so later, soon after dark, they attempted to work the short change on Mr. W. D. Rhoad. However, he declined to be caught by any such trick, and the police were put after them and they left town immediately. First they came into the store and made a small purchase from Mr. C. B. Free, a salesman in Mr. Rhoad's store, and a few minutes later one of the pair walked back to Mr. Rhoad and asked for a $5 bill for (5 in change which he laid on the counter. As soon as Mr. Rhoad produced a $5 bill, the fellow pushed it and the change together and told Mr. Rhoad he believed he would take a $10 bill for the whole. Mr. Rhoad saw through the trick at once and told him he would have to put down a $5 - ? X.J *4 A bill additional 11 ne wantea $iv, as the $5 bill already there belonged to him (Rhoad.) The fellow argued over the matter a few seconds, but soon saw he was in the wrong place to work a smooth game, and pulled out his $5 bill, which, with the $5 in change he handed over for the $10 bill Mr. Rhoad gave him. The pair then hurried out of the store. Mr. Rhoad at once put the police after them, but they left town in a hurry. Fellows of this stamp will find it advisable to give Bamberg a wide berth. The same fellows attempted to work the identical trick on Mr. V. J. Hartzog at Dr. J. B. Black's general merchandise store, but he told them he did not propose to change a $20 bill to sell a pocket handkerchief worth only five cents, so they left him. The Siemens-Pace Concert Company. These noted artists to give a recital at Carlisle Fitting School, Wednesday, December 16th. The people of Bamberg and the surrounding section are going to have the opportunity of enjoying one of the rarest treats in the way of music ever offered here. The lyceum management has secured the eminent German pianiste, Fraulein Frieda Siemens, and the great soprano soloist, Miss Florence Marion Pace, composing the Siemens-Pace concert company, for an engagement here Wednesday night, December 16th. This is an $150.00 attraction com -"J monoo-omont ronniHprs pau) f auu vuc uiauu^vuivM. that it was very fortunate indeed in securing them for an engagement in a town no larger than Bamberg. It all came about because they chanced to have an "off night" on their way up to Greenville, where they play the following night. But why can't the people of Bamberg enjoy an exceptionally good thing occasionally? We can if we'll pay for it Let's show our appreciation by packing the auditorium at the Fitting School on the night of this attraction. It would take too much space to go into the history of these musicians. Suffice it to say that they have entertained in the largest cities of Europe and America. Miss Siemens has toured Europe with Patti, Melba, Albani, and others, and was a pronounced success with the famous Boston Symphony Orchestra in this country. Miss Pace comes as one of Chicago's most gifted singers. She has had most remarkable sucna.ca in A mOrirfl and snent the nast iU A&4UV* ?v??y ? ?zr ? m. , year abroad. .Here is the statement of the lyceum system: "The Siemens-Pace Concert Company is the Alkahest's great doublestar attraction. For the past ten years the Alkahest has been trying to do something for the higher inspiration of the South. One of the greatest things it has done in this direction is winning the consent of these two great musicians to go out together and play and sing for the people. "We commend especially this company to our patrons and friends as the embodiment of the mission of music. Their charm of personality and beauty of character adorn their gifts with the grace of true womanhood. This combination is no experiment, as both Miss Pace and Miss Siemens have been at the head of most successful companies for the past several years." The prices for this concert, as you will notice in the advertisement, is 75c general admission or $1.00 for reserved seats. Local Option Best. Columbia, December 5.?That the anHoHnn fr?r a ctafp nrnhibi yi agiVHUVU AV* V- MV?w r-^ tion law may eventually injure rather than forward the cause of true prohibition and temperance is the opinion of Senator Niels Christensen, Jr., of Beaufort. Who Senator Christensen is and what he stands for the people of South Carolina know. He cannot be suspected of representing or favoring the liquor element or interests, for he has fought the liquor interests in a way that meant something, and his sincerity is unquestioned. Hobson Brings Suit for Slander. Boston, December 8.?It was officially announced to-day that action for alleged slander, returnable in the United States circuit court, February 1, 1909, in which $20,000 damages are claimed, has been brought by Congressman Richmond P. Hobson, of Alabama against Congressman John A. Keliher of Massachusetts. The alleged remarks which caused the action were made this fall, following a visit to this city of Capt. Hobson, who spoke for Joseph Conry for congress, the latter contesting unsuccessfully with Congressman Keliher for the nomination. i COUNTRY NEWS LETTERS SOME INTERESTING HAPPENINGS IN VARIOUS SECTIONS. News Items Gathered All Around the County and Elsewhere. Ehrhardt Etchings. Ehrhardt, December 7.?Well, Mr. Editor, we have had a few cool days. Several of our farmers have killed j some of their hogs, but most of them i are looking for colder weather to kill their large porkers. Some very fine hogs in this section^ as large or larger than the general average, but we have none that averages four hams to the hog. Farmers have sowed a good many oats around here, and some are still sowing. Some small lots of corn be-1 ing sold every day. Some say theyi 1 ? j vwntr ao n Iwnilcf^ nave maue mure luai, luci vau uvuov, so the most of the horses in this section are provided for. Farming if done right is the best occupation one can follow these days. It is healthy and lucrative, but most of our young men shun it and want jobs that are easier. Misses Blanchard and McKeithan spent Sunday with Miss Blanchard's sister, Mrs. Jack Smith. Mr. Tom. D. Jones spent Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night with his family. From here he will go to Charleston to attend the Masonic klodge meeting there this week. Rev. D. B. Groseclose preached an instructive sermon to an attentive audience at Ehrhardt Lutheran church Sunday morning. He held the attention of the audience for about thirty minutes, and some wanted to hear more. It is reported that some parties had a big turkey dinner on yesterday, and one of the guests ate so much until their shoe came off. JEE. Items of Interest Gathered by an Ehrhardt Graded School Pupil. Ehrhardt, December 7.?Mr. Editor, we have been silent for some time. We have been working and not talking. However, from now on we are going to do both. Mr. Jacob Copeland, one our trus iJ ? ? n nVt /?,?. tH <31 f loaf ICC5, p&lU UUI 9UUUUJI Ck vxoiv iM?v Friday afternoon. We are always glad to have visitors. It makes us feel that some are interested in our work. Come again, Mr. Copeland; and stay longer next time. We are in need of some wood. During the cold days of last week we used all we had on hand. Who will bring us a load? Rev. T. L. Belvin and family will leave us sometime this week. This will cause us to lose one of our school mates, Master Purdy McLeod, the adopted son of Mr. Belvin. We are sorry to see him go, for Purdy is one of our best pupils. Mrs. F. T. Moore and son, Clarence, who have been on an extended visit to friends and relatives, returned to-day. Miss Alma Blanchard and Miss Minnie McKeithan are visiting friends in our town. Mr. Bert Dannelly entertained the Ehrhardt social club last Thursday evening in Dannelly's hall. A hat trimming and a tie making contest was the feature of the evening, with the exception of the refreshments that were served. Each boy had to trim his partner's hat and she had to make him a tie. The best tie was made by Miss Carrie Moore for Mr. Frank Kinsey. Miss Ned Ehrhardt's hat, trimmed by Mr. Willie F. Hiers, was the best trimmed hat. Miss Leila Epps's hat, Mr. Jno Frank Chassereau trimmer, carried off the booby prize. GILBERT HIERS. EIGHT INDICTED FOR MURDER. Night Riders Charged With Lynching of Capt. Rankin. Union City, Dec. 8.?Eight indictments charging alleged members of the night rider band of Reelfoot lake with murder in the first degree were returned by the grand jury late today, the indictments alleging that the eight men named, Garret Johnson, Sam Applewhite, Arthur Cloar, Fred Pinion, Roy Ranson, Bob Huffman, Tid Burton and Bud Morris had a part in the actual putting to death of Capt Quentin Rankin at Walnut log on the night of October 18, last. All of the men indicted today are under arrest and when their cases are called for trial to-morrow the prosecution will announce as ready. The defense, however, will doubtless ask and be granted a brief delay. The witnesses upon whose evidence the indictments were drawn are Col. R. Z. Taylor, the associate of Capt. Rankin, who narrowly escaped a similar fate, P. C. Ward, the hotel keeper at Walnut log, Ed. Powell, a farmer who declared that he was forced to accompany the band on the night in question, and Frank Ferrin^ a member of the clan who has turned State's evidence and upon whose testimony the State depends largely for a verdict. Of the men indicted to-day, five are those whom Judge Matthews at Nashville ordered released under bond last week. NEWS PROM KEARSP. "Old Timer" Writes of Doings in the Lower Part of the County. Kearse, December 7.?Dry weather still prevails in this section. Have not had a good season in many weeks. The times are hard; cotton low. When is the boom to follow Taft's election All or these things are being discussed juBt now but no solution to any of them, and as usual it takes time and time only, with plenty of hard licks thrown in, for things to adjust themselves. So in the past, will be so in the future. The farmer with hog and hominy, a good garden, syrup, sweet potatoes, plenty of hay, milk and butter, need lose no sleep, but to the ones who have not, had best raise them for themselves or quit, for that is the atiIv Vinno fnr the farmers of this country. Then hard times will not hurt much. Then and not until tlien will we be a happy and prosperous people, town and country alike, for bankrupted farmers will ruin the other business enterprises. One can't live without the other. Let all try the above plan one year, raise plenty to sustain towns and country alike and note the change; and remember this, let cotton come last. If this is done by all it will make little difference who is president, nor growl about the. weather, for all .things come to the man that works brain and hands with plenty in his barns, store rooms, and smokehouses. Some might say it can't be done. Yes, it can, for with modern farming fifteen to twenty bushels of corn can be raised on every acre in Bamberg county. It was nothing unusual last summer to hear our young farmers say I will harvest 25, another 30, still another 40 bushels off one acre, or a field of it. That is right boys, keep abreast and ahead of the times, for an old man to discourage the young should be carried to a lonely spot in a swamp and tied head down to a sapling until he repents in sack cloth and ashes. Well does this writer remember, though a small boy, when Sherman's army marched through this country, marked by pillage and burning, hauling the bacon and corn from every farm house by the wagon load to camp, ^remained several days, and for all that, enough was left that no one starved the next year, and how the writer and his father ate their dinner under the shade of an oak prepared by a faithful old colored woman, Aunt Clara. Said dinner consisted of a small piece of bacon, corn bread, and cowpeas. No home, all burned. Those were hard times, but with pluck all went to work, and that is all that is needed now, but not so much on cotton, then all will be well. The Jolly Eight will give the pubic a treat on Christmas evening, the 25th of December, beginning at 8 p. m., at White Point school house. They will charge 25 cents admission for adults, 15 cents for children, and request that dogs be left at home. Hope they will have a full house, for all will be pleased, is the honest conviction of OLD 

TIMER. Southern Bell Gets Prize. At the recent Georgia State fair a premium was offered for the exhibit advancing the most valuable suggestions for the development of the social, educational and economic interests of the farm. The exhibit made by the farmers' line department of the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co. was owardpH ? hlue ribbon and di ploma of award as fulfilling the conditions under which the prize was to be awarded. In its exhibit at the fair the Southern Bell company displayed farmers' telephones and demonstrated the use of the telephone on the farm, the method of constructing lines and the details necessary to secure this class of service. The exhibit was a popular one with visitors from rural districts. The telephone is being used on farms and in rural communities to a greater extent than ever before, and the development of this feature of the telephone is receiving more attention from the Southern Bell company than ever before. The improvements in the farm line telephone, which have reduced the cost of this class of service to a minimum, has made it possible to supply every farm house within a reasonable distance of an exchange with telephone service. Pickpocket Prevents Marriage. Chicago, December 3.?"Love may laugh at locksmiths" on occasion, but a pickpocket is a different proposition. And when the pickpocket gets the marriage license and the honey moon railroad tickets?well this was the experience of Marion G. Lewis, of Indianapolis. Lewis is a traveling man. He also is a successful suitor for the hand of Miss Estelle Elizabeth Lawrence, 5547 Madison avenue. The wedding was set for yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, at the church of the Redeemer, Fifty-sixth A 3 >>+si ft QVOT111 o Street aiiu waDuiufi^u Shortly before the appointed hour Lewis notified Miss Lawrence he had lost his wallet on the train; also the ticket for the bridal tour to New Orleans and the marriage license. "Postpone the wedding? Well, not if Lewis knows what he is doing?" If Forsythe, the best man would just see that the church arrangements were all right, he would get another license, and be right out. But at the county building Marriage Clerk Salmonson insisted that the bridegroom was not known to him, and it took Lewis 15 minutes to establish his identity. It was just 5 o'clock when the bridegroom reached the church. He had negotiated some loans, more tickets were bought and the couple departed for New Orleans after the ceremony.

The president says the bill is intended to replace the present law which was placed on the statute books "piecemeal and hurriedly, partly on the eve of the war with Spain and partly after hostilities had actually commenced." After declaring the present law to be faulty and wholly inadequate to a 19 speedy and proper organization of a volunteer force, the president says the bill proposed, which was drawn under supervision of the chief of staff of the army, has the hearty ap?Awa1 mar danartment. pi U V A1 VI vuv T.
