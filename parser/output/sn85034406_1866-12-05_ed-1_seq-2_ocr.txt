Cave Johnson, at Clarksvillo, Tenne.ssne, cmivas another of the plil generation ,of- p ibl'tl man from among us. He a nativ-i of tha Suto of Tennessee, b.irn there in 179".,wh.3n it was almost allusively an unse'ttloJ wilderness, lie was " liberally educated, and after read ing law went into the practice of that pro fession, and served some time as a J udge of tho Circuit Ciurt. Very early in life, however, he engaged in the political contest of the dav. and abnit thi year 1828 he was chojen to represent, his. district in Uongnss, and continued to serve in that capacity du ring the whole eight years of General Jack sort's Administration. At tha time of Pres ident Polk's election Mr, Johnson wis se lected by that officer as his Postmaster Gen eral, and served until March 3J, 1849. The Defeat of the Constitutional Amendment. The late elections have resulted in the defeat of the Radical Constitutiona Amendments. Delewhre, ' Maryland and Kentucky have chosen Legislatures against it. The ten unrepresented Stetus in Con gress will not consent to it. , This makes thirteen; States ,in all, without counting Tennessee, who rejeet it. 1 There are now tlirrty-six Stat.es. ' A required three-fourths vote would be twenty' seven States, whereas but twenty-three are .ohiainecL But, asks an objector, can not this Majority be over come by the admission" of new Western Territories as States? Let us sec. They will bavo to admit four new States in order to gain one votel Thus,: if they shou'd admit twelve States, it Would bring up the whole' number of " States ' to forty eight. Three-quarters of that .number would be thirty-six States, whereas, after deducting the thirteen anti-amendment' States, the Radicals would have but thirty-five States, or one less 'ran the required number, it is most unlikely that the Radicals can possibly croato so large a batch of new States as the doxea that would be indispensable under such circumstances. Therefore, unless the Itadica Is resort to some revolutionary ex pedient to revive or carry the project, it my be considered shelved. Political Rascality In Content- -.. piauon. The Washington Correspondent of tho Bichmsnd (Virginia) Examiner thus notes 80ia. of the rascality and schemes the majority in the Rump Congress entertain. It y r- -, ''The "first act they will pass will be one repealing the annestv set of July, 1802, under which the President is authorized to extend amnesty to any person engaged in the late rebellion by- his proclamation. - "The proposition fur a general amnesty, either as an independent Executive act, or as oouplcd with 'impartial suffrage,"', has alarmed the .Radical majority. They fear that tbe President will steal a march on tbetn. ' : ; , The pardons already granted by the President they deem an impeachable offense. They will cripple his power -over the suh - ject. aa far as they -can, leaving him only the OoBstitutional power of pardon after a "Ibe next 'tmi chief set' of th session will be one under which the 8tate now excluded shail b brought under tha war nower of Uunsress Dower acknowled- ging oo limitation. . The main object of this aot.will be to give the political power of the ounoa eiciauau to men' Diacs population.--This may, be dene by disfranchising the . whites and enfranchising the blacks."

MPA- ; V'' -. X ' ' Popular Dlsfraactalsesnent. The Columbus Crrns well says that those who advocate that worst of Biodern humbugs miscalled "impartial suffrage,' as a prclimi- nsry to the reJuu'wn of our social system to the level of mongrelism, can have no inter est in the proerity and happiness of the cos n try, and it is a monrnful inetaaoc of the demoralization of tha times that so great and dangerous an inovation should be con tern plated upon no other grounds than that of partisan luccess, snd the spoils thereto annexed. The Abolitionists favor it be cause they tliink tbey can secure ;he negro vote, and thus obtain a bats for tbeir sec tional oreanisation in localities where it does not now exist, snd so by perfecting their pbliticil machine, retain the ascendan cy which tbey now hold in defiance of the great majority of the people. ,? Jo or threo notorious sheets claimirg to be Democratic have recently declared in favor of the hum bug in the same hope of partisan success. though tho stupid:ty of the latter proposi tion is too great to be worth considering. In m ny instances Abolitionists claim to favor it on the general ground of justice to the negro race, and that the negroes hhould le admitted to social and political equality as at abstract right, without reference to the effect of such a change upon the coun try. But in no instance that we can now recall has' there been a rational sensible attempt made to show that the introduction of the negro element would promote . the political, commercial and material interests. ot the social -happiness of the people, simply because no. reasonable man can affirm that such would be the effect Demagogues who eare for nothing but their own ad vancement, or fanatics who are utterly in differeul as to the financial or social con dition of their own race, preach and howl about negro raff race as if it was on indis putable right belonging to the negro, for the witholding of which no just reason can be given; but these people carefully refrain from citing the examples of similar experi ments to show that it confers a benefit on either raw, and as carefully omit to refer to those well known instances where the equality they seek to introduce has been destructive to the ipatorial and social inter ests of both races. In no country where tho mad project of negro equality has been tried, has it failed to involve the govern ment, in ruin, and the p-ople in tbe lowest depths 'or degradation.'. The appalling social degradation and political disintegra tion of the South American . States are frightful examples of the effects of the mongrelism which the Abolitionists, as a mere political expedient, would now engraft upon this country.. . The character is in compatible with enlightened freedom and the exerise of high political rights. Had it been otherwise, the South American State,, would not be the seething cauldrons of dis cord that 'hey are. Had itbeon otherw'me, the negroes of the South would have l ing since gained and maintained the thing their worshippers now seek for them. The introduction of .negro suffrage as an element in our politics can have no less de structive effect thai) the reduction of popu lar elections (already sufficiently farcical) to a mere mockery. Where the negroes are most numerous and ignorant, there would thjy have the mi-st power. In many local ities they would have complete cortrol, and such localities would speedily retrogate into jungles. . In others thijy would have enough strength' to be an element of danger, nnd confusion. Everywhere they would be con trolled by demagngres of the lowest order: everywhere would they be an element of discord; everywhere would there be disgust and danger, ..until the people, becoming afraid of themselves, would coireiiinlfite with complacency the establishment of a despotism that would do away with this mockery of popular elections. . lhis is lie real object of the oligarehists who have t he agitation under control. They want a moir "ved aristocracy, exemption liom the mir- dens of the Government, with the privilege to draw their own enormous interests and blood money- from the masses. They tear that their own vast and shaky public debt will some day become as burdensome to the working people as is the public debt of En gland to her laboring closse;, and then our laboring masses would be as ready to shake it down wish their votes as are the poor of England to shake off the- debt which de grades them and pampers their aristocracy- . ', .. :' . . . One of the evils of this monstrosity of negro suffrage is the prospective disfran chisement of' the laboring white' peoplo by the introduction of new qualifications. This whole Abolition revolution has been a revolt in the direction of despotism as against d mucraxjy, and negro auffnge and popular disfranchisement are essential to the complete triumph of despotism. .. ., i The Oldest House li New tlam- h Si I re. ';',. The following is from, tho Portsmouth (N. II.) Journal: , . , "The oldest house bow standing, built in Portsmouth, isi tlm quaint briqk houso on the Weeks' farm, Greenland. This is no blunder although it seems like one for at tho time that'' nouse was built, Greenland was a part of Portsmouth; Ve o:w find no written record of the year of its being b'ti I ," but a family tradition dates its creation iu 1037, by the father of. Leonard Weeks. The house was built on the mailt road,' but the straichteninir of the road half a century ago, throws it on-a circular and several rods on the si Jo. ' 'lm' speckled appearance of the house is made by having black headers scattered among th'J. bricks all over the front. The bricks were burnt in front of the house. The walls of the house ". 're eighteen inches thick. It is of two-stoiies; the lower etory is uilit airl a na! teet, the second eurlH reet. Ibe windows were originally fit small diamond glass set in lead.

But we are also con vinced that in this respect we aro still far behind our opponents. Thy will rarely even tntu-h or read a Democratic paper, and while this is carrying bigotry too tar, yet Dt-mocrats nftt n err inoxaotly the opposite extreme. For twenty five een's per year, or some trifle equally as inconsiderate, they will be induced tn Mthst-ribe for a paper that will poison the minds of their children, and make them inveterate ADoiitionists. ine Abolition party having nearly all the mi. nepotists, traders and manufacturers at the North on their side, and i-apported as tln-V arc mainly by the advertising patronago of the mnnopoli t classe-1, tliey are ntten enab led to outstrip more humble Democratic newspapers that stand by the rights of the people. These papers care only to get enough to pay the more cost of their circu lation, the profits of their business being in advertising, of which only a limited amount can be secured by Democratic papers Democrats, if in earnest in sustaining tbeir prireiples, ought really to pay at least one third more for their pajiers than the Abo litionists do for theirs, and even this would not begin to be equivalent to uivtr adver tisihg patronage, ' . Our readers will see from this the disad vantages under which Democratic papers labor. It is no more than justice, to say thet every man who now tuiolUlies a ireal Democratic papfcr, does a self sacrificing work, and taken as a class, we know of no truer or more patriotic men than the Dem ocratic editors of the Jfwthcru States. ' As a body, they aro far in advance of the poli ticians, who, in many instances, are a dew weight upon them. We say, therefore, that if there are any classes or men who deserve well of Democrats, it is, taken as a whole the Democratic editors. We urce, there fore, that Democrats generally should try to understand the difficulties under whiflh their edi;ori labor, and when they seo what advantages the Abolition press havo ever them they, will feel like tiikiug hold and aiJing them with material aid in their un e.inai fi;;ht. As the New Year approaches, let syste matic efforts be made to givo a wido ex tension to Democratic journals. . Active Democrats "hould commense early making out lits of those who ought to. and proba bly in!! take (it called upon) a local paper. Let it bo the business ot some one to see his Democratic neighbors, and urge upon them the necessity of sustaining their p" pers. Don't wait until some Abolitionist has been along ami got them to subscribe for some' out and out M'ongn l sheet, or some namby-pamby "Conservative" paper, which is just as bad. Remember that ut most every postmaster, tax gatherer, and every clergyman, is an ajient for the monop olists, negro-equalizers, and public plunder ers. Democrats must be doubjoy vigilant, if they would pirpetuate their principles and save republican institutions from com plete overthrow and their children from the crushing taxation of a moneyed aristocracy and a monopolist's despotism.

According to these figures it appears that the Democracy haj (inclu ding Southern negroes) a majority over the Republicans in the.' whole nation of throe miliums ofpenole, and five hundred thou sand voters: and that nearly all the avail able political strength of the' Republicans was in the North, while' that of the Demo crat was; diffused in about equal propor tion over both North snd South, Now, lib affirmed, 'that no smci sectional party cnnld long nwintuM itself tvjainal such ak tihta gtmut.
