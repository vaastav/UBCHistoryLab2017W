I Tiic President and (onarc???The Tenure of, OOice Law, Tbo general policy of President Grant, as developed in his late Message to the two houses, is so fully in accord with tbo general programme or the republican party that by common consent, it may now bo said, he is master of the situation and of tho succession. He holds the advantages which General Jack f >n possessed after his first annual message, lie is, without <hs.-:i;at, recoguized as the offi cial htad and leader of tho dominant party, and is without a nval for the next Presidential election. His rocomm Utiona touching the legfsla- I tioa of the present besslon of Congress. moan time, i're shrewdly calculated to hohl tho republican party together and to avoid trouble ia tho ranks ia tbo elections of next fall for a new Congress. For exampleHo recom mends that all --ebonies for a general revision c?f tb.' tariff and internal revenue laws be post poned till the next 3ef ;ion of Congress. Ilcro a great stumbliug block is avoided; for upon tho Hriif question?the East being for homo protection, and the West for froe trade?there will modt probably be sotno serious eoclioiial defections in the camp with any marked change of the existing tarifl' laws in fuvor of free trade or protection. Again, if upon tho Cuban question the pro gressive men of Congress are dissatisfied with the conservative precautions of the message, they will surely be nppeascd in considering the emphatio American views which General Gran: has expressed in reference to tho Ala bama claims and Canadian reciprocity.. So too. It the extreme radicals were disposed to be intractable In reference to tho recognition of the conservative Walker party of Virginia on the question of the restoration ?f that State they are, we suppose, satisfied with the equiv alent presented in tho President's recommenda tion for a new and radical reconstruction of the State of Georgia, on tho basis of tho Leg islature of 1808, with the restoration, or the negro members ruled out of each house by the white majority. On the money ,1U(?fltion the President's plan of funding the debt at an interest reduced from six to four and a half per cent, and of a grad ual return to specie payments, to avoid the dangers and saocks which a too abrupt roturn to coin would bring upon tho country, is apian so clearly calculated to work advan tageously to tho Treasury and the peo ple that we cannot doubt its adoption by Congress, nor its advantages to the repub licans in tho important elections of next au tumn. So, too, with the proposition to reduce the income tax to three per cent, and to limit this tax to a term of three years. So, too, his earnest ndhesfon to tho doctrines of a strict integrity In fniaiiing all our obligations, and 1 of equal protection to all citizens of tho United States In every part of the Union, regardless of uatlonalKy, religion, color or politics. But the Tenure of Office law is an ex crescence upon tho statute book which Goneral Grant cannot admire and will not lot. alone. Speaking of the distribution of the offices with which It* i? charged, he ?ays, "it upy be to mention hero the embarroMment possible to arise from leaving on the statute books the so-oalled Tenure of Ofiloo act,' and to earnestly reoommend its total repeal ;* and he thinks that it oould not hare been the inten tion of the framers of tie constitution, when providing that appointments made by the Pre sident should receive the consent of the Senate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office persons placed there by the federal appointment against the will of the President, and that "the law is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient administration of the government." So says General Grant, and so say wc. The law makes the President the more creature of the Sena to in the matter of his removals from office, for this is the point where the shoe pinches. Surely, then, if the two houses have full confidence in the President, if they have no misgivings that with a fret* rein ho may become a seoond Andy Johnson In setting up for himself, they wil! promptly repeal this ob noxious and originally vlndiotive Tenure of Office law. Wo apprehend, however, that the Senatorial favorites and the cliques and fac tions of intriguing spoilsmen concerned will resist this proposition of repeal, and that the Senate itself will hardly consent to give up to the President the power which it holds by the law in question over tho distribution of tlio spoils. Wc have seen so much of tho con temptible trickery of party majorities that we think it quite likely that the Senate will fail to appreciate the simple, honest, outspoken character of General Grant, and will still seek rather to use him than to strengthen him in his position. If the radical leaders of the two houses, however, have a remnant of party sagacity left them thoy will surrender this Tenure of Office law as a usurpation which has served its purpose, and as an olfonce, a check and a ninnace upon the President whioh ought to be removed. lUtrcbvHi Explanation. The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher seea that his association with the recent ante-mortem nup tial oeremouy was a blunder. His explanatory letter makes tbip fact plain; at the same timo in that letter he fails to acknowledge hia fault in a fair and handsome way. IIo justifies his oourse ou a statement of his viow of how the caso Btood before he appeared in it. Now a man ce.nnot plead one ol his own faults in mitigation of another. It does not lighten an otfencc to say that it is the legitimate conse quence of a previous offence. Yet that is Beecher's plea. This man stole the livery of heaven to servo the dovil with most offensive pomposity; he abu3cd his sabred office to ploes an adulterous connection, to glorify a libertine aud to retiect all possible obloquy upon a man in prison by giving the sanction of his name to tho statement that the shooting of Richardson was without possible justification. Having done all this ho excusos himself by declaring that he was ignorant of the facts? that be had formed his opinions on a grossly one-sided view of the case. For what are a man's sensor given him, then, if he cannot use them to better purpose ? Is it not a little inconsistent that this would-bo innocent should so much set himself up as a guide 'or men when ha cannot guide himself in a matter so notorious that none need bo ignorant in regard to it ? Wo are glad to see that Mr. Beecher fools tho propriety of yielding the position lie had taken on this sub ject In deference to-public sentimont. It is noteworthy that, all the three pawona con cerned make substantially the same defence as to one point?they were all fooled into their connection with this business by Greeley. Greeley, who never did caro a button for any social line?whose first and greatest claim to noticc was always his defiance of the proprie ties of life?never stopped to inquire into the right of this matter, as he never does into the right of any matter, but went ahead with an intemperate "on to Richmond" determination to make everybody believe that Richardson was right. IIo fooled tho parsons on, and now will let them get out as they may, not caring to get out himself, aa he is quite in his element in tins-particular sort of muddle. The Opening of the Eruuieiiieul Council, To-day the Ecumenical Couucll opens. The impossibility of throe hundred years becomes a fact. The chimera of Joseph do Maistre is a livlug, visible, tangibly reality. The Catholic bishops of the w rid in largo numbers are in Romo. The Pope fi,?d3 himself at the head of his flock as no Pope has found himself in many centuries. What a wonderful ppectaclo Rome will present to-day! Since tho days of ' Pompc y and Cii^ar it has not, perhaps, seen any such spectacle. What will tho Council do? Who can tell? On Thursday evening, when Fathw Ilyacinthe speaks out in this city, and tells us what he knows, we may have a elearer and more perfoct idea of the Council than we yet have. It is a great pity that the debates in the Council, if there be any debates, must be conducted iu bad Latin, and that the speaking will revive the experience and pos sibly tho confusion of Babel of old. Flty also it is that the Tope and his friends aro so senni tive. The proas seems to bo a bugbear. Cor respondents are to be kept beyond the Roman lines. The most alarming thing in connection with tho Council is tho rumor of a Garibaldi raid upon Homo. What a flutter such a raid would make! All fun and frolic aside, wo await the intelligence relating to tho oponing of this Council with very great interest. When facta aro so near wo aro not unwilling to refrain from detraction or praise.

U*5S.VOE and Reports.?The financial community are satis fied with the calm, dispassionate and unpoliti cal recommendations of General Grant and Secretary Boutwell. Tho speculators, includ ing soma of the national banks, are dissatisfied with certain propositions of the latter, which if carried out would curtail their profits, to tho benefit of the community. The people, the merchants aud the private bankers are grati fied. Caste.?An altogether new version of Robertson's popular play entitled Caste was performed last evening at Washington, MIsb Worm ley, with "a poach blossom complexion," Monsieur Paul Gerard, "a dark little French man, darker than his bride," and Rev. Dr. White (who officiated at tho marriage of thi* Uppy couple} being the prlaoipal ?cWr?, The Charter BwttM*Tlw Benll. At sundown last evening the polls closed on the charter campaign of 1869. Following ao closely on the State and county election, held in the first week of laat month, which gave suoh an overwhelming victory to the Tammany Regency, there waa very little spirit left with the lato dominant party to show fight over the spoils embraced within the municipal offioes open for election. These offloes consisted of nine oivil and nine police justices, elected for six yoars; a Common Coun cil, composed of a Board of Alder mon and Assistant Aldermen, elected for two years, and twenty-one School Trustees. Added to these was the unexpected balloting for Mayor, in oonsequenoe of a technicality raised as to the term for which Mayor IIall was elected last yoar. No question had - been openly mooted on this point, but it being ascer tained that tho republican and Democratic Union loaders would spring a candidate for Mayor ut the last moment, and if successful bring the question into the courts, the Tammany leaders, in the faoc of Mayor Hall's objection to such a conrse, determined to checkmate this move by opening a ballot for Mayor. Of course the natural result followed of a second triumphant election of Mayor Hall for the term of two years, dating from 1869. With but one exception the Tammany nomi nees lor civil and polioe justices have been re-elected. Judge Dowliug, by virtue of his re-election, becomes ez-offlcio a Judge of the Court of Speoial Sessions for tho full term of six yoars. It is owing to this distinction that he has boen popularly dubbed Chief Justice of the Magisterial Bcnoh in the city. This is the second term upon which Judge Dowling enters with his nomination endorsed by every party organization in the city, supported by the united votes of the whole district. Judge Quinn (civil branch) has alsobeon re-elected, encoun tering not a shadow of opposition. In two districts, the present incumbents not receiving a Tammany nomination, contested the election as against the regular nominee, bnt were beaten, and they retire on the first of the new year. In the Aldermanio contest Tammany has lost at least two districts?the Tenth returning a candidate on a republican ticket, and the Eighteenth electing Florence Scannel, noto rious from his participation in the late riot, in which he was seriously wounded by a pistol shot, and who ran on the Democratic Union ticket. The Assistant Aldermen elected are all Tammany democrats. Our returns on tho balloting for School Trustees, so far as they go, show the election of all the Tammany can didates. The vote yesterday was far below that polled in tho city at the November election. This naturally arose from the apathy among the democraoy in tho absence of any united effort on the part of the republicans and out side democratic organizations to enter the lists as against the Tammany nomiuoes. To a groat extent, therefore, tho election wont by default. Little can bo said of the composition of the new Boards of Common Council. It is to be hoped, however, that in the opening era of restored municipal rights to the city, which they will be the first officially to receive the benefit of, they may demonstrate tho wrong done in the past by republican legislation and prove that it is only in the hands of tho citizens that municipal government can be safely and profitably lodged. The day passed off very quietly and with a gratifying minimum of the disturbances which generally attend tho excitement consequent upon charter and other elections in the oity. The President 01 Naturalization. Tlio President in his Message has drawn attention to a species of fraud in oar system of naturalization wiiich has probably escaped public notice. Our minds have been directed so much to those frauds developed at the registry office and the ballot box that the kind of abuse which the Frosident refers to has been in a measure overlooked. President Grant says, for ex ample, "The unsettlod political condition of other countries less fortunate than our own sometimes induces their citizens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of being naturalized. Having secured this they return to their native country and reside there with out disclosing this change of allogianco. They accept official positions of trust or honor which can only be held by citizens of their native land. They journey under passportB describ ing them as citizons still; and it is only when civil discord, after years, perhaps, of quiet, threatens their persons or their property, or when their native State drafts into its military service, that the fact of their ohange of allegi ance is made known. They reside perma nently away from the United States, they con tribute nothing to its revenues, they avoid the duties of this citizenship and they only make themselves known by a claim of protection." The President is right on this point. Not only is this practice a great abuse but It ia a griov- ' ons injustice to those who honestly become citizens and carry out legitimately all the obli gations of citizenship?who pay taxes, do jury duty and military duty when called upon, and in every way contribute to the good weal of the country by thoir industry and good conduct. This latter class can be numbered by hundreds of thousands. The class to whom the Presi dent refers are, fortunately, but few, yet the principle to which the Message objects is not the less mischievous for that. The President, therefore, is quite right in directing our diplo mats and consular officers "to scrutinize care fully all such claims for protection"?in other words, to protect the real citizen of the United States against the frauds perpetrated by the fraudulent citizen, who only obtains his natu ralization papers for the purpose of shirking obligations duo to the country of his nativity. That there Has been a good deal of that kind of thing done is undoubted?in the German States, especially, before the recent treaty with regard to military service was agreed to. Wo are glad that the President has drawn the attention of Congress to this snbject. It in the first time that this view of the naturalization laws has been taken by our Chief Magistrates, and it is to be hoped that it may pave the way i for some new legislation upon that qnostion ; | for, says the President, "the citizen of the United ! States, whether native or adopted, is entitled I to its complete proteation. While I have a i voice in the direction of affairs I shall not con i sent to imperil the sacred right by conferring I tt upoft QeUUoui 9* GwiAultai clilouAlAi".. part ilt (IhwI OmkUHN* (M>?ol?l HWW ?r Ikt BlmnklMa Pm??l ?ii hM Ik* W?f? rf "?* * tfc* First of Mw Ttrtoa. The Ecumenteai Coi?oll summon** b/ Pope Pius IX. assembles in Bona to-day. ? W '* called the First Council of the Vatican, and will be registered on the reoord of the Catholic Church m the twenty-first General Council of the hierarohy of that particular creed and form of worship. The prelates, patriarchs and other Church dignitaries have journeyed from Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the far-off shores of Australasia to the Eternal City, and will aggregate in round numbers one thousand persons after the roll has been called. It is an august, most reverend and imposing convocation In its appearance, and ono whioh affords matter of very deep interest to the Christian world, da this aocount we devote a large spaoe in our pages to-day to an elucidation of the history of the Catholic Councils which have been hold slnco the period of the moeting of the First Council of Nice to the present, the circumstances under which they mot, their work and consequencoa. Wo also present all the Pontifloal doouments con nected with the present one, including copie3 of the Papal Invitations issued to the Eastern and Protestant Churohes to send delegates to ltome for "instruction," preparatory, as it would seem to be hoped, to a return to the "one fold" or "centre of religious unity." The peculiar, compact and almost universal system of organization of the Catholic Churoh, its manner of government by an elective Chief Bishop and the College of Cardi nals, with Its means and power of intercommunion and propagandism, are sot forth in such a shape as will ouable our readers of all religious persuasions to understand why .it b that Its clergy have been, and now are, so successful in the work of missionary enterprise. The relations of the temporal sovereigns of the Old World towards the Pontiff and bishops?a matter of the utmost consequenoe at the present moment?are treated In order according to the power of the respective countries. Indeed we may claim that nothing of material value has been omitted, and that the Herald of this morning will remain in after time a more faithful and accessible register of the Council of the Vatican for the use of all Christian peoples?that of the numerous Catholio community of the American Continent In particular?than any which has been published of the provioua Roman episco pal congregations. The pens of our special correspondents in Europe, aided by steam and electricity, havo enabled us to accomplish this work, so that our readers can after its perusal draw their own independent inferences as to whether Rome in her penetration sees the handwriting, the mene tckd et eupharson on thowall, and is preparing to meet Its conse qnences, or whether she will be enabled to sustain her priestly claim that sho is "over new and ever baptizing and being baptized, and thus, after an adjustment, take a new leaso for the commencement of a religious career In accordance with the spirit and requirements of tho age. In this connection we print a faithful trans lation of the Syllabus of Errors, as it is termed or the Pontifloal and hierarchical platform! Is said that this document will bo adopted by the Council, viva vooe and without discussion should this prove to be true we can see but little use in a meeting undertaken at eo much personal Inconvenience and cost. Indeed, we cannot shake off the lay infirmity of thinking that the Catholic Churoh would sustain a very severe shook before tho eyes of an enlightened world In consequence. Science and material progress will havo their apostlos and advo cates in the Council. The Archbishop of Cal cutta, India, travelled through the Suez Canal one of its first passengers?on his way Rome, whilo tho Bishop ot Honolulu, In the Sandwich Islands, was carried from San Fran Cisco to New York over tho Pacific -Railroad when journeying in the same direction. Tho first, having steamed over the grave of Pharaoh and his mighty host, must cortainly reflect on tho evanescence of all temporal power, whilo the latter will speak to his compeers of what man has accomplished and can do by the subornation of the agencies of modern civiliza tion. The Council of the Vatican meets on the day of tho Feast of Immaculate Conception. It is also the anniversary of the birthday of Horace, the Roman poet having first seen tho light on the 8th of December, in the year G5 before the birth of Christ. It is one of those curious coin cidences which occur in the course of a world, The spark of the Syllabus may havo boon lighted in the brain of tho satirist, when he asserted that in ancient Rome nemo contontm vivat ilia torte seu ratio dederit teu for9 objecerit?"no person lives contented with the lot which reason has accorded or chance presented to him.'-' And then he wont on to show the prevalence of the succui ncgrce lol liginitt?the "juice of the black cuttlefish"?in the slanders, defamations, detractions and belittlings of personal worth and privato character which abounded on every side around him. Indeed, he characterizes his friend and patron Maecenas "the tutelary guar dian of peace, civilization and progress"? words of wonderful, prophetic accuracy, and which were almost immediately sanctified in the text of the earliest Christian who appeared within a very few years after hi* decease. If the Conuoil of the Vatican can elaboralo tho grand idoas of tho poet into a shape fit for everyday disciplinary practice in the world people may be disponed to accept even tho Syllabus, and the Papacy remain, despite the after utterance of tho Queen Boadicea, "Rome shall perish ; write the word la tho blood of those she spilt." Peim's Game.?Om' latent" telegraphic news informs us that tho leaning of Frim towards the republicans is daily becoming moro marked. If the report be correct it reveals the character of Priin aad explains the situa tion. If on tho shoulders of tho republican party Frim rode to the mastership of Spain and became dictator for lifo, who should won der? The news is interesting, but it does not surprise. Not Wantxd.?The Brooklyn Aldermen refused by vots to offer one thousand dollars reward for the detection of fraudulent practices at elections.. They do aot want tUoso prac UW to *9 WNtlfl* Report of the Secretary ot Uie Itirrtwfc Wo publish ty-dsj the report of the $eer+> taryolthe Interior, giving (he salient points la the management of that department for t^e last fiscal jeer. Jjjfe bare soi?e interesting statist tlos of the sale of pyblip lands, of whloh more than seven and a half trillions of acres were disposed of; a million acres more than last year. It Is worthy of notice and well to know that there has been a large inorease of land entered under the Homestead law, amounting to nearly half a million acres more than last year. With regard to the management of the Patent Office Secretary Cox urges the repeal ot all laws which authorize an appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents on ap plications for loiters patent and in interference cases. Referring to the subject of pensions the report states the curious fact that there Is not a single soldier of the Reyolutionary war living to claim a pension, while there are eight hundred and eighty-seven Revolutionary soldiers' widows surviving and drawing pensions. Within the last year only one of these widows died, the number on the rolls then being eight hundred and eighty-eight. The total number of ponsions on the roll is one hundred and eighty-seven thousand nine hundred and sixty-three, and the total amount disbursed was over twenty-eight mil lions dollars. F9t the prevention of the la numerable frauds which have infested the pension bureau the Secretary recommends that ponsion agents should be paid by a fixed salary, and the present system of per centage on the money disbursed should be abolished? a point upon whioh we think the Secretary 1c right. Indian affairs, of course, absorb a good portion of the report. The red man is one of the difficulties of the government. Mr. Cox, however, thinks that the present Quaker sye* tem of dealing with him is an excellent one, and is quite satisfied with the work the Friends have already done. The employment of unat* tached army offioers as Indian agents he also approves of, on the score of economy. The old idea of gathering the tribes on reservations and civilizing them, and oven giving them a representation in Congress, is advanced; but the trouble is that we have been trying this plan for many years and have as yet had but little success, except with the Cherokees, Pottawottamies, Osages and a few other tribes. The Seorctary reaches the real cause of tho difficulty in this respect when he says that.tho want of appropriations to fulfil our treatieo with the Indians is the chief obstacle in tho way of peace. The fact is that our agents and commissioners promise too much and perform too little. The savage is distrustful. If he makes a bargain with the white man he expects him to keep his word, and if disap* pointed he becomes unmanageable. Tho sub? jects of education and of the can sua also occupy a brief spaco in tho report. The Union Pacific Railroad completed one hundred and sixty-five milos of road and telegraph during the last fiscal year, and in the regularity of running trains and genoral management makes altogether a fair show, according to the report of the commissioners. The present Secretary has had but a brief experience in office, but his report is, never* theless, full and satisfactory. President Grant's View# on KmlmtlMi The President evidently appreciates Km wants and requirement? of our emigratioa system. The grossest abusos hare grown up Tor some years pust in the transport of emi grants to this country and their proper dis posal upon landing here. In his message the President informs us that upon his accession to office he found that a proposition from tho Minister for North Germany had been made, but not acted on, for the negotiation of a con vention for the protection of emigrant pass on gers. Feeling the necessity of such a tneasuro the President, it appears, invited all the mari time Powers of Europe to join in it, and with this view notes have been sent to the Cabinets of London, Paris, Florence, Berlin, Brussels, the Hague, Copenhagen and Stockholm to em power their representatives In Washington to enter into negotiations with a convention in this country for tho purpose of making uniform regulations as to tho construction of tho parte of vessels to bo devoted to the use of eml grant passengers, as to the quality and quan tity of food, as to the mcdical treatment of tho sick, and as to the rules to bo observed during the voyage, in order to secure ventilation, to promote health, to prevent intrusion and to protect females, and providing for tho estab lishment of tribunals in the several conntrloa for Enforcing such regulations by summary process. This is precisely tho reform most needed in our emigration system, and tho prompt action of General Grant proves that he comprehonds tho matter thoroughly. A Bust Day for Bbroh.?The friend of tho horse had an active day for his sympathies and assistance on Broadway yesterday, when the slippery snow and heavy loads brought many a fine animal down. Oh that tho sympa thy for the horso would bring about the clean ing of Broadway after every snow storm I Sympathy for man will never do it. Fkmat.k Scffmagk has been adopted away out in Wyoming, where women are scarce andi accordingly are appreciated. It is, on aoconnt of the scarcity of women, not a first rate place to test the matter, but we are glad the expert* ment in to be tried somewhere.
