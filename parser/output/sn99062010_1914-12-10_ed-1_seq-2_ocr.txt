The set tlers have organized now, and em ployed attorneys to resist the payment of that fee, which they claim the gov ernment still attempts to collect in Melette county under the guise of tres pass upon allotments. The settlers further claim that the government has no right to fix an arbitrary price for trespass, and that the Indian if dam aged has his full recourse under the state statutes. The settlers further claim that the government resists the payment of any damage done by Indian cattle, tress passing on settlers* crops. The settlers think that the same state law applies to Indians and white settlers. CLAIMED BOY'S DEATH DUE TO ROUGH TREATMENT Plankinton, S. D..

EXPRESS COMPANY IS HELD NOT GUILTY OF ILLEGAL SHIPMENTS _. Claims That Accused Man Took -First Test Case oi Charges cm File Against Four Concerns In Clark County. Clark, S. D.. Dec. 7.—In state circuit court here the American Express com pany was acquitted of violation of the South Dakota statute regarding the shipment of liquor from a wet terri tory to a dry territory within the state.

I should like in this address to review the notable record and try to make adequate assessment of it hut no doubt we stand too near the work that has been done and are our selves too much part of it to play the part of historians toward it. Moreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past- While h.ave untj were all cha. ged 'with th® same the circumstances of the whole age have offense, on different counts, and the been altered by war.

Must Help Europe. War has interrupted the means of trade not only, but also the processes of pro duction. In Europe it is destroying men and resources wholesale and upon a scale unprecedented and appalling. There is reason to fear that the time is near, if it lie not already at hand, when sev 9F'a,.?i the countries of Europe will find it difficult to do for their people what they have hitherto been alwavs easily able to do—many essential arid funda mental things. At any rate, thev will 5 need our help and our manifold services as they have never needed them before and we should be ready, more fit and ready than we have ever been. It is of equal consequence that the nations whom Europe has usually sup plied with innumerable articles of man ufacture and commerce of which they are in constant need and without which their economic development halts and stands Btill can now get only a small part of what they formerly imported and eaererlv Their lines of trade have hitherto run chiefly athwart the seas, not to our ports, but to the ports of Great Britain and of (the older continent of Europe.

The United States, this great people for whom we speak and act, should be ready, as never before, to serve itself and to serve ter of Ewert, for state treasurer, is third, with ests and water powers of our national do 54.006. Both Hepperle and Ewert are 1 ways and means. We have the are we fully ready to use them? And, if we can make ready what we have, have we the means at hand to distribute it? We arc not fullv ready neither have we the means of distribu tion. AVe are willing, but we are not ful ly able. We have the wish to serve and to serve greatly, generously but we are not prepared as we should be. We are not ready to mobilize our re sources at once. We are not prepared to use them immediately and at their best, without delay and without waste. To sepak plainly, we have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our mer chant marine. And now, when we need Bhips, we have not got them. We have year after year debated, without end or conclusion, the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ores and for- main in the rich states of the west, when we should have acted and they are still locked up. The key is still turned upon them, the door shut fast at which thou sands of vigorous men, full of initiative, knock clamorously for admittance. The water power of our navigable streams outside the national domain also, even the eastern states, where we have worked and planned for generations, is still not used as it might be, because we will and we won't because the laws we have made do not intelligently balance en couragement against restraint. We with hold by regulation. I have come to aslc you to remedy and correct these mistakes and omissions, even at this short session of a congress which would certainly seem to have done all the work that could reasonably be expected of it. The time and the cir cumstances are extraordinary, and so must our efforts be also. Conservation Measures. Fortunately, two great measures, finely conceived, the one to unlock, with proper safeguards, the resources of the national domain, the other to encourage the use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the generation of power, have already passed the House of Representatives and are ready for immediate consideration and action by the Senate. With the. deepest earnestness I urge their prompt passage. In them both we turn our backs upon hesitation and makeshift and formulate a genuine policy of use and conservation tin the best sense of those words. We owe we as belleve that of the have riot the certain and constant means of transportation upon which all .11 able and useful commerce depends? Arm how are we to get the ships if we wait for the trade to develop without them? To correct the many mistakes by which we have discouraged and all but destroyed the merchant marine of the country, to retrace the steps by 'which we have, it scorns almost deliberately, withdrawn our flag from the seas, except where, here and there, a ship of war is hidden to carry it or some wandering yacht displays it, would take a long time and involve many detailed Items of legislation, and the trade which we ought immediately to handle would dtsapppar or find other channels while we debated the items. The case is not unlike that which con fronted ns when onr own continent was to be opened up to fettlemcnt and indus try. and we needed long lines of railway, e.\tended means of transportation pre pared beforehand, if development was not to lag Intolerably And wait interminably. AVe lavishly subsidize.! the building of transcontinental railroads. We look back ripen that with regret now. because the subsidies led to many scandals of which we are ashamed but we know that the railroads had to be built, and if we had it to do over again we should of course build them, but in another way. There fore I propose another way of providing the means of transportation, •which must precede, not tardily follow, the develop ment of onr trade with our neighbor states of America. It may seem a reversal of the natural order of tVings, but. it is true, that the routes of trade must be actually opened—by manv ships and regular sail ings ana mod oral charges—before streams of merchandise will flow freely and profitably through them. Hence the pending shipping bill, dis eussed at the last session but ns yet passed by neither House. In my judgment such legislation is imperatively needed and can not wis ly he postponed." The government must open these gates of trade, and open them wide open them before It is al together profitable to open them, or al together reasonable ask private capital to open them at a venture. It is not a question of the government monopolizing the field. It should take action to make it certain that transportation at reason able rates will be promptly provided, even where the carriage is not at first profit able and then, when the carriage hal be come sufficiently profitable to attract and engage private capital, and engage it in ab'indancc, the government ought to witli iraw. I very earnestly hope that the congress will be of this opinion, and that both Houses will adopt this exceedingly important bill. Wants Rural Credits. The great subject of rural credits still remains to be dealt with, and it is a mat ter of deep regret that the difficulties of the subject have seemed to render it im possible to complete a bill for passage at this session. But it can not be perfected yet, and therefore there are no other con structive measures the necessity for which I will at this time call your attention to: but I would be negligent of a very mani fest duty were I not to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that the pro posed convention for safety at sea awaits its confirmation and that the limit fixed in the convention itself for its acceptance is the last day of the present month. The confcrence in which this convention origi nated was called by the United States: the representatives of the United States played a very infiuential part indeed in framing the provisions of the proposed convention and those provisions are in themselves for the most part admirable. It would hardly bo consistent with the part we have played in the whole matter to let it drop and go by the board as if forgotten and neglected. It was ratified May last by the Gorman government and in August by the parliament of Great Britain. It marks a most hopeful and de cided advance in international civilization. We should show our earnest good faith in a great matter by adding our own ac ceptance of it. There is another matter of which I must make special mention, if I am to discharge my conscience, lest it should escape your attention. It may seem a very small thing. It affects only a single item of appropriation. But many human lives and many great enterprises hang upon it. It is the matter of making adequate provision for the survey and charting of our coasts. It is immediately pressing and exigent in connection with the immense coast line of Alaska, a coast line greater than that of the United States themselves, though it is also very important indeed with re gard to the older coasts of the continent. We can not use our great Alaskan do main, ships will not ply thither, if those coasts and their many hidden dangers are not thoroughly surveyed and charted. The work is incomplete at almost everv point. Ships and lives have been lost in "thread ing what were supposed to be well known main channels. We have not provided adequate vessels or adequate machinery for the survey and charting. We have used old vessels that were not big enough or strong enough and which were so near ly unseawortby that our Inspectors would not have allowed private owners to send them to sea. This is a matter which, as I have said, seems small, but is in reality very great. Its importance has only to be looked into to be appreciated. Economy In Government. Before I close may I say a few words upon two topics, much dlscusspd o\it of doors, upon which it is highly important that our judgments should be clear, defi nite, and steadfast? One of these Is economy In government expenditures. The dutv of eeonomy is not debatable. It is manifest and impera tive. In the appropriations we pass we are spending the money of the great peo ple whose servants we are—not our own. We are trustees and responsible stewards In the spending. The only thing debatable and upon which we should be careful to make our thought and purpose clear is the kind of economy demanded of us. I as sert with the greatest confidence that the people of the United States are not jeal r»u?J5f t,ie Senate: I mean fhe bill which gives a larger measure of self-government to the people of the Phil ippines.

It is said In some quarters that we are not prepared for war. What 13 meant by being prepared? Is it meant that we are not ready upon brief notice to put a nation in the field, a nation of men trained to arms? Of course we are not ready to do that, and we shall never be in time of peace so long as we re tain our present political principles and institutions. And what is it that it is suggested we should be prepared to dor To defend ourselves against attack? Wei have always found means to do that, and.' shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling our people away lrom. their necessary tasks to render compul sory military service in times of peace. Allow me to speak with great plain ness and directness upon this great mat ter and to avow my convictions with, deep earnestness. I have tried to know what America is, what her people think, what thev are, what they most cherish, and hold "dear. I hope that some of their finer passions are in my own heart— some of the great conceptions and desires which gave birth to this government and which have made the voice of this peo plea voice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world, and that, speaking my own thoughts, 1 shall, at. least, in part, speak theirs also, how ever faintly and inadequately, upon,, this vital matter. Afraid of Nobody. We are at peace with all the world. No one who speaks counsel based on fact or drawn from a Just and candid inter pretation of realities can say that there is reason to fear that from any quar ter our independence or the integrity of our territory is threatened. IDread of the power of any other nation we are* incapable of. tire not jealous ot rival ry in tho fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean! to livo our own lives as we will but also to let live. We are, indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the pos-: sessions of none, de.sire the overthrow: of none. Our triend^h'p c*in be accepted! and is accepted without reservation, be-: cause it is otfercd ill a spirit and for* a purpose whicli no one need ever ques tion or suspect. Therein lies our great-! ness We are tho champions of peace* and of concord. And we should be very jealous of this distinction which we liavej sought to earn. Just now we should be partie.ularlv jealous of it, because it is our dearest present hope that this char acter and reputation may presently, irv. God's providence, bring us an oppor tunity such as has seldom been vouch safed any nation, the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a healing settle ment of many a matter that has cooledt and interrupted tho friendship of na-^ tions. This is the time above all othersf. when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self possession, our in fluence by preserving our ancient prin ciples of action. From the first we have had a clear and! settled policy with regard to military! establishments. We never have had, and. while we retain our present principles and ideals, we never shall have, a largo standing army. If asked "are you ready, to defend yourselves?" we raply. "most, asturedlv, to the utmost," and yet we shall not turn America into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves. There is, another sort of energy in us. It will know how to declare itself and make itself effective should occasion arise. And especially when half the world is on flref we shall bo careful to make our moral', insurance against the spread of the con flagration very definite and certain and adequate indeed. Favors Strong Army. Let us remind ourselves, therefore, of the only thing we can do or will do. We must depend in every time of national peril, in the future as in the past, not upon a standing army, nor vet upon a re serve army, but upon a citizenry trained and accustomed to arms. It will be right enough, right American policy, based. uion our accustomed principles and prac tices, to provide a system by which every citizen who will volunteer for the train ing may be made familiar with the use of modern arms, the rudiments of drill.' and maneuver, and the maintenance and sanitation of camps. We should encour age such training and make it a means of discipline which our young men, will learn to value. It is right that we should provide It not only, but that we should: make it as attractive as possible, and so induce our young men to undergo it at such times as they can command a little freedom and can seek the physical development they need, for mere health's sake, if for nothing more. Kvery means' by which such things can be stimulated is legitimate, and such a method smacki of true American ideas. It is right, too. that the National Guard of the states should be developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our obligations to our own people or with the established policy of our gov ernment. And this, also, not because the time or occasion specially calls for such measures, but because it should be our constant policy to make these provisions for our national peace and safety. More than this carries with it a reversal of the whole history and character of our polity. More than this, proposed at this time, permit me to say, would mean: merely that we had lost our self-posses slon, that we had been thrown off our bal ance by a war with which we havn noth ing to do, whose causes can not touch us,, whose very existence affords us oppor tunities of friendship and disinterested service which should make us ashamed o£ any thought of hostility or fearful prep aration for trouble. This is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a gov ernment like ours were raised up, the op portunity not only to sneak but actually to embody and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting concord! which is based on justice and fair and' generous dealing. For Strong Navy. A powerful navy we have always re garded as our proper and natural means of defense and it has always been of de fense that we have thought, never of ag gression or of conauest. But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build?' We shall take leave to be strong upon tho seas,, in the future as In the past and there will be no thought of offense or of provocation in that. Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the experts tell us just what kind we should construct —and when will they be right for 10 vcars together. If the relative efficiency of craft of different kinds and uses contlues to change as we have seen It change under our very eyes in these last few months? But I turn away from the subject. It Is not new. There is no new need to dis cuss it. We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some amongst us aro nervous and excited. We shall easily and sensibly agree upon a polfcv of de fense. The question has not changed it* aspects because the times are not normal. Our policy will not be for an occasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing, which we will pursue at all' seasons, without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of tho world, the abiding friendship of states., and the unhampered freedom of all with whom we deal. Let there be no miscon ception. The country has been misin formed. We have not been negligent of national defense. We are not unmindfid of the great, responsibility resting upon us We shall learn and profit by the lesson or every experience and every new circum stance and what is needed will be adc quately done. I close, as I began, by reminding you oi the great tasks and duties of peacc which challenge our best powers and invite us to build what will last, the tasks to which we can address ourselves now and at all times with free-hearted zest and with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we possess. To develop our life and our re sotirces to supply our own people, and tho people of the world as their need arises, from the abundant plenty of our fields and our marts of trade to enrich tho com merce of our own states and of the world with the products of our mines, our farms, and our factories, with the creations or our thought and the fruits of our charac ter—this is what will hold our attentioit and our enthusiasm steadily, now and in the years to come, as we strive to show In our life as a nation what liberty and Inspirations of an emancipated spirit may do for men and for societies, for individ uals, for states, and for mankind.
