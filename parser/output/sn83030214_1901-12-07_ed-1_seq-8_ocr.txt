The long expected biography of Eugene Field. riy Piason Thompson, of "The Chicago Record- Herald." "Eugene Field: A Study in Heredity and Contradictions," is published this week by the Pcribners.

He would think more of making it reflect the odd personality of the man than rehearse the birth, development, daily life and works of the author.
