Editorial Remarks by Henry Watterson and Other Journalists. CONGRESSIONAL OPINIONS. Views af Leading Senators and Repre sentatives on Its Salient Fea* torti—Mr. Havemeyer'a Tala of Woo. By the Associated Press. Louisville, Ky., Dso. 3.—The Cour ier-Journal, Democratio, says: The pres ident's annual message, submitted to congress yesterday, is unusually long, and is almost as uninteresting as it is long. Aside from the indorsement and synopsis of Secretary Carlisle's plan for currency reform, with one or two other recommendations, tbe message has but little other significance than attaches to a olock-liks condensation of the various departmental reports. In tbis respeot it is very different from some of the pre. oeding messages of Mr. Cleveland. A 

BUSINESS-LIKB DOCUMENT. Omaha, Dec. 3.—Tbe Bee, Republican, will say: Tbe portion of President Cleve land's annual message wbioh will com mend tbe first attention ol tbe financial and busineaa interests of the country is that relating to the currency,witb whicb the message concludes The msssage is a practical, business like document, notably free Irom tbe peculiar characteristics whioh distin guish most of Mr. Cleveland's deliver anoes, and will repay oareful perusal for tbe great amount of uaelul information it contains. A 

DISAPPOINTMENT. Kansas City, Dec. 3.—The Journal, Republican, says: Tbe president's mes sage is a document wbioh will attract attention only because of its length and not because of handling of subjects in whicb the American people are inter ested. Like all his official acts during the present term, the document is a dis appointment to the people and must be a humiliation to his remaining adher ents. 

STRIKINGLY LUCID. The Times, Democratio, says: The striking feature of President Cleveland's aunual message is its striking lnoidity and comprehensiveness. The surpris ing feature ol the document is the ab sence oi any recommendations that would invite contention. Tbe message Is written in tbe vigorous style and rug ged periods wbioh mark all the state papers of Mr. Cliveland. longest and driest. Sr. Louis, Dee. 3.—The Globe-Demo crat will say: The message of tbe pres ident this year is the longest one he bae ever written and tbe one tbat contains the least matter of original interest and importance. That part of the message wblch will attract the most attention is the outline of a plan for a new currency system. A 

SATISFACTORY DOCUMENT. Chicago, Deo. 3.—The Herald (Dem ocratio) will say: The annual message of Mr. Cleveland is very muoh in earnest and those portions wbioh express his personal views on public policy and tbe principles of tbe government have his usual force and directness. On the whole it is a satisfactory document wbiob clears up the situation, whiob will excite bnt little hostile criticism and wbich is s creditable American state paper. SUGGESTIONS OF GOUT. Tbs Tribune (Republican) says: Witb the exception of tbe brief tariff state ment and the somewhat longer financial statement, the message is purely clerical and reveals tbe routine work of the de partments. Summed up, it is a long business message, without partisan ex altation on tba one hand or useless mourning over recent catastrophes on tbe other hand, and with evident sug gestions of gont. NO NOTE OF LEADERSHIP. New Yobk, Deo. 3.—The World says: Tbe message as a whole ie a disappoint' ment. There is no clear note of leader ship in it. It contains not tbe slightest recognition of the causes of the recent disaster to the Democratic party. It has not a word indicating the purpose to amend the faults and correct tbe blunders tbat oontributed to this de feat. A CRIMINAL BLUNDER* Denver, Deo. 3.—The Republican, (Rep.), will comment on tbe president's message tomorrow as follows: In July, 1893. when President Cleve and, at the dictation of tbe money power and in aocordance with an evi dent agreement witb tbe English gov ernment, called the fifty-third congress together in special session to repeal the purchasing clause of tbe Sherman law, be boldly declared in bia call that repeat was all that was necessary to restore prosperity in this country. He accom plished his purpose by the coercion of the cuckoos of his own party through bull-dozing and a ahrewd nso ot the patronage ol his office, but although he has made many publio utterances since tbat time, he bat never taken occasion to notily tbe country that bis prophesy regarding tbe beat method ol securing a return of prosperity has bsen fulfilled. The reason is obvious. Tbs times have grown worse instead of better since the repeal bill passed in tbe fall of 1393 and even President Cleveland does not pos sess the hardihood to attempt to justify that stupendous criminal blunder. 

CONGRESSIONAL OPINION. Commnnte of Landing Senators and Rep resentative on tho M< eaaeje- Washington, Dbc. 3.—Speaker Crisp had no opportunity to examine the message carefully, owing to the frequent interruptions, and waa not prepared to express an opinion until be had done so. Mr. Wilson, chairman oi the ways and means committee, expressed his great gratification over tbe President's vigorous recommendation of the free coal and iron bills sent to the senate, and hia endorsement of tbe recommen« dation oi tbe abolition of the differen tial on refined sugar. Mr. Bryan, Democrat, of Nebraska said he was opposed to any fiuanoial toheme whioh would give private indi viduals Ibe power to issue money. Mr. Harter, (Democrat, Ohio), char acterized the president's banking tcheme as a good, long step in the right direction, but personally, bs thought be ought to go further. Toe government, in his opinion, ought not to guarantee tbe payment of national bank notes or of any corporations. Mr. Bailey, (D3moerat, Texaa), is op posed to tbe government becoming a surety for tbe promissory notes of any business corporation, even though it be a bank. Senator Mitchell, (Republican, Ore gon): "His whole financial scheme is impossible. It is a position really going back to old wild cats." Senator Blancbard, (Democrat, Louis iana): ' I approve of tbe state banks recommendation. lam opposed to the repeal of the one-eightb and one-tenth ol,a cent differential on sugar, for tbe reaeon tbat 74 per cent of the seven million pounds of sugar produced in Louisiana shares in the differential." Senator Hanebrongh, (Republican): "I had heard tbe president was suf fering from the gout and tbe message confirms it." Senator Perkins (Rep.) of California: "I like his recommendations for an in crease of tbe navy, bat am opposed to bis free ship position." Gen. Catcbings (Democrat, Mississip pi) one of the committee on rules, strongly endorsed the president's finan cial views. Senator Vilas (Dem.) of Wisconsin: "It is a good business msssage." Of the Democratio members of the committee on finance, Senators Voor hees. Harris aud Vest asked to be ex cused from expressing any opinion on the financial views advanced by the president, aod Senator Jones of Arkan sas would only repeat what be has here tofore said, tbat he did not believe any financial legislation could be possible daring the present session. Republican members of tbe committee were almost as disinclined to talk as tbe Democratic oolleagues. Senator Sherman woold go no farther than ta say tbe message contained noth ing striking. Senator Allison declared it was not a time for Republicans to take the lead. Senator Brice: "The Baltimore plan strikes me as a pure dream. Its adop tion would certainly demoralize the finances of the country." Senator Teller, Republican, of Colo rado : "I cannot ace tbat the message offers any relief to the country, and it appears to me as if tbe president failed to eomprebend tbe financial or political situations." Senator Stewart—"The financial plan in Cleveland's message, stripped of verbiage, means tbat the United States shall give bankers $75 for $11.50. Any bank tbat will deposit $22 50 of legal tender, whether greenbacks or treasury notes, will receive $75 of oar government money—a cunning way of retiring green backs. It removes all restrictions of tbe banking law againat expansion and contractson by tbe bank, to enable them and their associates to 'ring' the mar ket." 

HAVEMEYER'S WAIL. Tba Sugar Baron Do.a Not Like tho President* Meeaage. Nbw Yobk, Dec. 3.—President H. O. Havemeyer of the American Sugar Re lining company this evening gave oat tbe following signed statement: If une will fairly and dispassionately consider tbe president's recommenda tion, it will become apparent that it comes down to this: "Tbe sugar com pany haa taken action, tbe result of wbioh is to deprive temporarily of work 25,000 persons employed in the various industries depend ent upon tbe refining of sugar, together with the members of tbeir families. I recommend such action ss to deprive those persons of work permanently." "If the industry ia languishing, the proper course is to destroy it, Tbere are some things tbat can be established through a demonstration. A compari son of the duty put by the tariff bill up- l various articles will sbow tbat while the maximum protection accorded to sugar is 5 per cent, other and more favorable articles receive protection uo to 40 and 50 per cent. Why this discrimi nation should be made against a large number of persons wbo hold the stock in tbe company and are employed in its refineries, it is impossible to say. Tbey protest against it. Tbe answer to tbis protest in tbe president's message is, tbat, as tbe preaent protection is inad quate, it ought to be removed altogether. "Reasonable legislative service requires that tbe sugar industry shall bs treated aa other important industries are. If this ia done the industry cannot lan guish and thousands of discharged workmen will have remunerative em ployment. "Tbe country has already prononnced ita judgment on tbe mode in which the last oongresa dealt with the interests of tbe workingmen. Tbe president appar ently has not learned that lesson. It ought not to require much time for workmen to appreciate that tbe presi dent, in a bid for personal popularity, is willing to strike a death blow to tbeir intereete. 

UNTOLD HORRORS Indescribable Atrocities by Turks on Armenian Christians. WORST NOT YET TOLD. Bloodcurdling Accounts of the Outrages by Eye- Witnesses. THE STORIES OF REFUGEES. Tender Girls and Women Brutally Out raged—Men Cruelly Tortured and Slain—lnnocent Babes Slaughtered. Athens, Dec 3.—[Copyrighted by the Associated Press.] —The Associated Press exclusively has been able to give to the world the faots of tbe terrible atrocities perpetrated npon Armenian Christians in Asia Minor, and today a representative of tbe Associated Press succoeded in securing additional infor mation confirming tbe previous state ments made. Tbe representative today met 20 Armenian refugees who arrived here from Armenia after a journey fall of hardships and Buffering. Securing the services of a first-class interpreter,he gathered the Armenians together at a convenient place, and having relieved their pressing necessities, the interpre ter questioned the refugees concerning tbe terrible events of wbich tbey bad, in • number of cases, been eye-wit nesses. Tbie party of Armenians is the first tbat has escaped from the districts where the massacres occurred, and it is believed that even worse remains to be told, as the horrors described are under stood to have lasted for a long while alter this party left. Most of tbe par sous who told their stories today escaped from Moosh, Bitias aud Sassoun, taking with them what little tbey could carry and making their way with the greatest difficulty to the Rosso-Turkish frontier and going to Erivan and Etchmiadzin. Beveral Armenian women escaped from the villiages with tbe party, but when near Erzeroam tbey died from tbe effects of sabre wounds inflicted upon tbem before their escape. For about 18 montbs, the Armenians Bay, the province of Sassoun has been surrounded by Turkish troops. Nobody has been allowed to enter or leave. About four montbs ago the Tarkish au thorities learned that tbe inhabitants of Vertemis, a village outeide tbe frontier of Sassoun, were sending for tbe neces saries of life to tbe village of Dalvorig Such communication between the two' villages being prohibited, the Turks massacred nearly all the inhabitants ol Vartemis. This was tbe second massa cre to occur. Tbe first took place about a year ago. One of the refugees, a man named Khadjik, states tbat bis unole and aunt were both killed, the latter bad been violated previous to being put to death. An Armenian priest named Kevont was killed for refusing to celebrate Turkish rites in bis church at Vartemis. The village contained 325 Armenian bouses beiore the Turks attaoked it, but when tbe fugitives left only 25 houses re mained standing. Dalvorig, it appears, is the largest village in the province of Sasaoun, and its Inhabitants, when they learned of tbe horrors perpetrated by tbe Turks at Vartemis, attacked tbe Turks on tbe frontier. The Turkish commander eventually sent 12 soldiers into Dalvorig to learn what had occurred. The Armenians, filled with indignation at tbe atrocities committed by the Turks at Vartemis, attacked this detachment of Tarkish soldiers and put tbem all to death. When the Turkish commander heard of tho death of bis soldiers, be deter mined on a vengeancs in tbe most bloody manner possible. A strong force of Turkish troops waa sent to tbs village with artillery, and the maesaore began. Guns kept up a continuous fire upon Dalvorig until practically not one stone was left standing upon another. Selo, tbe bey of Initzoun, a Kurd, witb a detachment of Kurdish cavalry, went with tbe Turkish soldiers to the village of Semal and forcibly took tbe Armenian priest from his church, after disgustingly defiling tbe sacred vessels and the priest's bands. Tbey then bound bim on a donkey, whioh they drove a distance of a few yards. The soldiers then fired at tbe priest and killed bim and tbe beast be was bound to. In the same village the Tarkish sol diers entered an Armenian house and violated a woman and her dangbter, tbe latter being 14 years of age. From tbis village Selo forcibly took eight Ameri can girls and sent (hem to his harem at Initzoun. Further atrocities were committed by tbe Turks at the village of Veliebnsen. Before dawn tbis place was surrounded by soldiers, and while the inhabitants were still asleep it was set on fire. Tbe brutal soldiers entered the residence of a man named Araket, who was asleep with his wile, and tortured tbem both in a horrible manner with red bot irons. At tbis village tbe soldiers killed the Armenian priest, Morgoua, with the 20 other inmates of a house. Tbey were burned to death, the soldiers preventing anybody from escaping from tbs burn ing building. The cbiel of tbe village of Cbeneg was captured by tbe soldiers and booed to TWELVE PAGES.

All three were then scalded to death witb boiling water, A detnebment of 25 regulars of the Turkish cavalry, alter committing inex pressible horrors at tbe village of Seb ghank, went to the village school and ravished the girls found there and then devastated the building. Ibo Bey, tbe notorious Kurd brigand of tne Djibran, and a colonel in tbe reg ular army, went with a detachment of Turkish troops to tbe Armenian vil lages ot Bahlou, Hatezgent and at each place committed every crime there is to commit. After driving out tbe men, they collected the female children of Bnhlou together, about 200 in all, and after ravishing tbem, tbey killed tbem all witb guns and swords. Alter this massacre tbe Turkish soldiers regaled themselves witb wine and whatever else tbey could find in tbe village. Tbe Kurdish regular troops of Kizan and Bah ran entered tbe Armenian vil lages of Allanouzig and AghUg, killed tbe inhabitants and wrecked tbeir houses. The number of villages devas tated in tbis manner is aaid to be over 32. Tiie Armenians fled in every direc tion, but many ol tbem were captured by tbe Turkish troops before they could get away and were taken to prison. Kbadijak, who was the principal spokesman of the Armenian refugees, told the whole story in a moat convinc ing manner. Dr. G. Thoamain, a well known Armenian, has just reoeived a letter written on September 29 from Todorian, a village near Erzeroum. The writer says: "How can I write suoh horrors of our life for the dsya sinoe tbe 14th. Mount ed robbers rode up to this village an hour alter sunset and immediately be gan an indiscriminate attack upon the Armenian inhabitants. Over 200 shots were tired it the bouse of Rev. Mr. Zookis, pastor of tbe Prostestant com munity, wbo was absent from Erzeroum. Three balls struck tbe pastor's wile in the face. She subsequently died from tbe effects of ber wound. Some poor people from Knooa, wbo were living in tbe basements of the pastor's booae, hur ried up stairs when the firing was going on,' and all of them were wounded. Mr. Richardson, an American missionary, came from Frzsroum to attend the fun eral of the pastor's wife. On September 25tb, a band of robbers committed mur der at Andag and carried off cattle. At Dody they broke into bouses and plun dered tbem of tbeir contents." Dr. Thoumain was formerly a pro fess rat tbe American college at Mor sovan and was himself the victim of cruel persecution at tbe bands of the Turks, in 1893, when eerioua disturb ancea occurred in various parts of Ar menia, and scores of innocent Christian people were thrown into prison and the Christian college burned. On repre sentations made to tbe Turkish govern ment by tbe department of atate of the United States, Dr. Thoumain was par doned. •IXKCOTIVK OLIEMjpNOY.

Wasuinotos, Dec. 3.—Tbe opening oi the ihort session of tbe house nee pio turesqne in a way, bnt devoid of inter* esting leatures. The victorious Repub licans and tbe defeated Democrats ex* changed greetings and gave and took thrusts on tbe recent political battle with much animation but thorough good nature. Tbe galleries were crowded and half the desks on the floor were smothered with flowers. The leaders on both sides got enthusiastic receptions from their respective partisans, the appearance of Speaker Crisp, ex Speaker Reed, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Burrows being tbe sig nal for long and loud outbursts. There was no chance in tbe first day'a proceeding for reference to the elections, so the actual prooei-dings were dull and uninteresting. Seven new members were iworn in, and after a long wait the president's message was read. Although it was listened to with interest, it was concluded without a mark of approval or disapproval. Tbe bouse was called to order prompt* ly at noon. Many members' desks were strewn with flowers, aa one wit said: "Flowers for the living and flowers for the dead." On the desk of ex-Speaker Reed was an immene floral ship of state sent by "a protectionist." On the desk of Representative Lintol of Michigan, was a large floral school house, tbe com pliments of an A. P. A. organization, in acknowledgment of bis championship of publio schools. When Mr. Reed entered, a ringing cheer from bis party associates greeted bim. A moment later Representative Wilson, of West Virginia, entered, and was enthusiastically greeted by his as sociates. As tbe bands of tbe clock pointed to 12, Speaker Crisp entered and ascended tbe rostrum. Witb several bard banes of the gavel, the speaker restored order, and the second session of the Fifty-third congress began. Rev. Bug by. chaplain of the house, invoked the Divine blessing, and then tbe roll waa called. Breckinridge of Kentucky, with snow white hair and beard, entered and walked quietly to bis seat. A pace car rying a large armful of Marechnl Neil roses, followed and placed tbem on hia desk. Roses, chrysanthemums, orchids and other flowers were carried in prolu sion to other members until tbe hall looked like a bower. RoM call developed the presence of 216 members, 47 more than a quorum. John S. Harrison of Alabama, John Lit tle of Arkansas, William L. Henry, Charles E. Coffin and William Baird of Maryland, William Becker of Kentucky, J. H. Bromwell of Ohio, and Michael Griffin were escorted to the bar of the bouse and sworn in. Theßpenker announced the resignation of Amos J. (Jammings, who resigned to accept the appointment of sub way commissioner of New Yo-tk city. Wilson, Uolman and Reed were ap pointed a committee to join a similar committee from tbe senate to inform the president tbat congress was ready to receive any communication be desired to make. At 12:30 the bouse took a re cess until Ip. m. to await tbe presi dent's message. At 1:35 p. m., Mr. Pruden, tbe presi dent's executive clerk, appeared with tbe message, which was read by the clerk of the houee, Mr. Kerr. Tbe reading of the message occupied an hour and 45 minutes. It was listened to witb careful attention, especially tbe portions relating to the tariff and banka ing scheme, but tbere was no demon stration when it was concluded. Several routine reports were pre sented, after wbicb Scranton, Repub lican, of Pennsylvania announced tbe death of P. Wright, tbe late represent ative from the Fifteenth district ol Pennsylvania. The usual resolutions were adopted, and tben, as a further mark of respeot, tbe house at 3 o'olook adjourned until tomorrow at 12 o'clock.
