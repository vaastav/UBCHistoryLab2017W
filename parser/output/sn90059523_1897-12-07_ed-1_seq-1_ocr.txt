SAINT PAUL GLOBE. House and Senate Assembled for Their Reg= ular Annual Meeting. PRESIDENT'S VIEWS. Most Attention Paid to the Currency and Cuban Question. TO STOP THE CHAIN. Plan to Hold Greenbacks Re ceived in Exchange for Gold. TIME FOR SAGASTA. Congress Urged to Be Con servative in Dealing With Cuba. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— President McKinley today sent his annual mes sage to congress. He congratulated it upon assembling under felicitous con ditions. Peace and good-will with all the nations of the earth continue un broken, he says, and we should feel genuine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and unifica tion in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party prejudice. The leading por tions of the message are devoted to the currency question and to the rela tions with Spain as a result of the in surrection in Cuba. The most important financial recommendation is that when greenbacks are presented for redemp tion in gold they be held apart and paid out only when gold is received for them. The recommendations of Secre tary Gage that national banks be al lowed to issue notes to the full par value of the bonds deposited, that the tax on such notes be reduced to V z per cent, and that the minimum capital for a national bank be reduced to $25, --000 are all approved. In the event of such legislation it is urged that na tional banks be required to redeem their notes in gold. The essential feature of that portion of the message devoted to Cuba is that Spain is making an apparently fair and honest effort to satisfy the cVamarrds of the Cubans, by reforms both in govern ment and in the method of carrying on the war, and that time should be given to test these new plans. The president does not regard the present conditions such as to warrant a recog nition of belligerency. International bimetallism is touched upon, and it is stated that there is still some hope of an agreement. Interna tional arbitration and Hawaiian annex ation are called to the attention of con gress in general terms; legislation for Alaska and for the Indians of the five civilized tribes is asked, and the Pa cific roads' matter is briefly touched upon. The full text of the message is as follows: 

JEXT OF MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of Representatives: It gives me great pleasure to extend greet ing to the fifty-fifth congress assembled at the seat of government, with many of whose Eenators and representatives I have been associated in the legislative service. Their meeting occurs under felicitous conditions, justifying sincere congratulation and callug for our grateful acknowledgment to a bene ficent Providence which has so signally blessed and prospered us as a nation. Peace and good will with all the nations of the earth continue unbroken. A matter or genuine satisfaction is the growing feeling of fraternal regard and uni fication of all sections of our country, tho incompleteness of which has too long delayed realization of the highest blessings of the Union. The spirit of patriotism is universal and is ever increasing in fervor. The public questions which now most engross us are lifted far above either partisanship, prejudice or former sectional differences. They affect every part of our common country alike, and permit of no division on ancient lines. Ques tions of foreign policy, of revenue, the sound ness of the currency, the inviolability of na tional obligations, the improvement of the public service appeal to the individual con science of every earnest citizen to whatever party he belongs, or in whatever section of the country he may reside. The extra session of this congress, which closed during July last enacted important legislation, and while its full effect has not yet been realized, what it has already accom plished assures us of its timeliness and wis dom. To tt-st its value further time will be required, and the people, satisfied with its operation and results thus far, are in no mind to withhold from it a fair trial. Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of congress, the question next pressing for consideration is that of the currency. QUESTION OF CURRENCY. The work of putting our finances upon a sound basis, difficult as it may seem, will appear easier whon we recall the financial operations of the government since 1866. On the 30th day of June of thnt year wo had outstanding demand liabilities in the sum of $725,865,447.41. On the first of January, 1.579, these liabilities had been reduced to $143, --859,495.58. Of our interest bearing obliga tions, the figures are even more striking. On July 1. 1566. the principal of the interest bear ing debt of the government was $2,332,331,208. On the first day of July, 1593, this sum had been reduced to $583,037,100, or an aggregate reduction of $1,747,294,108. The interest bear ing debt of the United States on the first day of December, 1897, was $847,365,620. The gov ernment money now outstanding (Dec. 1) consits of $346,681,016 of United States notes, $107,793,280 of treasury notes Issued by au thority of the law of 1890, $384,963,503 of sil ver certificates, and $61,230,761 of standard silver dollars. With the great resources of the government and with the honorable example of the past before us, we ought not to hesitate to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and relieve our financial laws from ambiguity and doubt. The brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to 1893. makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our finan cial ability or soundness; while the situation Continued on ftixth l'ago. TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7. 1897. SESSION ALL SHOW. No Business of Any Gen eral Interest Was Transacted. GALLERIES FILLED. Rich Floral Displays on the Desks of Many of the Members. THE USUAL ROUTINE, Rule for Three-Day Adjourn ments Vacated by the House. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— The attend ance upon the session of the senate to day, both on the floor and in the gal leries, was notably large despite of the well-understood fact that little busi ness beyond the presentation of the president's message and the proceed ings incident thereto would be trans acted. Prior to the convening of the senate the members passed half an hGur in exchanging greetings. Mr. Hanna, of Ohio, who has been ill for a week, was given a cordial reception by his Republican colleagues. Mr. Wol cott, of Colorado, one of the members of the international monetary commis sion, was also given a warm greeting. Dr. W. Godfrey Hunter, of Kentucky, the recently appointed minister to Guatemala, was an interested specta tor of the proceedings from a seat be side his friend. Senator Deboe. Charles Page Bryan, the new United States minister to China, was a notable figure in the reserved gallery, and in the dip lomatic gallery were several members of the Chinese legation and other mem bers of. the diplomatic corps. When j the senate convened after the recess, Hon. H. D. S. Money, the new senator i from Mississippi, entered the chamber, but the oath of office was not admin istered to him during the session. The reception and reading of the president's message was the only feature of the day. The senate chamber was a veritable conservatory. The floral display was unusually rich and beautiful, and the odor of flowers wa^ heavy in the hall. The Republican members were partic ularly well remembered with floral presents. One of the most notable of the offerings, both for size and beauty, was that presented to Mr. Foraker, of Ohio, a magnificent tree of American Beauty roses set in a stand of ever greens and ferns, from the senator's "Republican friends of Columbus, O." Among the senators who received flow ers were Mr. Butler (N. C), a horse shoe of roses; Mr. Hansbrough (N. D.), a basket of roses and lilies; Mr. De boe (Ky.), roses; Mr. Allison (Io.), roses; Mr. Cannon (Utah), a bunch of handsome roses; Mr. Smith (N. J.), American Beauty roses and chrysan themums tied with pink silk ribbons; Mr. McEnery (La.), a handsome cres cent of pink roses; Mr. Shoup (Idaho), basket of fruits and flowers; Mr. Per kins (Cal.), a miniature birch bark ca noe filled with carnations and a basket of roses and chrysanthemums; Mr. Proctor (Vt.), bunches of roses; Mr. Hawley (Conn.), roses; Mr. Nelson (Minn.), chrysanthemums and roses; Mr. Thurston (Neb.), handsome jar of roses and ferns; Mr. Mallory (Fla.), a stand of American Beauty and Bride roses. Precisely at 12 o'clock the gavel of Vice President Hobart fell and the senate was called to order. The invo cation was delivered by Rev. W. H. Milburn, the blind chaplain. He maae a beautiful and touching reference to "our beloved president," who awaited news from the bedside of the mother \ to whom he is devoted and prayed that she might have a peaceful pas sage to the celestial shore. Seventy seven senators responded to their names at roll call. The venerable Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, was first recog nized by the vice president. He offer ed a resolution, which was passed in the usual form, that the secretary in form the house that the senate was in session and ready to proceed to busi ness. Mr. Allison (Io.) presented a resolution that a committee of two senators be appointed to join a like committee from the house to inform the president that congress was in ses sion and prepared to receive any com munication which he might desire to make to it. The resolution passed and the vice president named Senators Al lison and Gorman (Md.) as the senate committee. By resolution of Mr. Cuj lom (111.) the time of daily meeting of the senate was fixed at 12 o'clock noon. On motion of Mr. Hale (Me.) a recess was then taken until 1 o'clock. At 1:30 the senate reconvened and the committee consisting of Mr. Allison and Mr. Gorman reported that the president had informed the committee that he would immediately communi cate with congress in voting and he expressed the hope that the delibera tions of congress might result in great good to the country and reflect honor upon itself. The president's message was present ed by Mr. Pruden, the president's as sistant secretary, and was at 1:35 laid before the senate and read. Senators gave the closest attention to the read ing of the message, a majority of them followed it from printed coppies with which they had been supplied. That Continued on Seventh Page, Significant Paragraphs From the President's Message. 

CURREXCY QUESTION— Tariff legislation having been settled by the extra session of congress, the question next pressing for consideration Is that of the currency. * • • The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the government of maintaining the parity of our different forms of money; that is, keeping them all at par with gold. We surely canrfbt be longer heedless of the burden this imposes upon the people, even under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past four yoars have demonstrated that it is not only an expensive charge upon the government, but a dangerous menace to the national credit. • * * I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold, and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only paid out in exchange for gold. • ♦ » I concur with the secretary of the treasury in his recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposited for circulation, and that the tax on circulating cotes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per cent per annum. I also join him in recommending that authority be given for the establishment of national banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. I recommend that the issue of national bank notes be restricted to the denomination of ten dollars and up wards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of congress then I would recommend that national banks be required to redeem the notes in gold. * •» * * * * * * * 

CUBA— The instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departure for his post directed him to impress upon that government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war in Cuba by reaching a peaceful and lasting result, just and honorable alike to Spain and the Cuban people. • • * I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and therefore inadmissible. • • • Of the untried measures there remain only: Recognition of the insurgents as belligerents; recognition of the Independence of Cuba; neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants, and intervention in favor of one or the other party. I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of. That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggression. • * • It is honestly due to Spain and to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations and to prove the asserted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed If it shall hereafter appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity, to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part, and only when the necessity for such action will be so clear 'as to command the support and approval of the civilized world. When that time comes that action will be determined in the line of indis putable right and duty It will be faced without misgiving or hesitancy in the light of the obligation this government owes to itself, to the people who have confided to it the protection of their own interests and honor, and to humanity. *** ""** * * HAWAIIAN AWEXATION-While constantly disavowing, from a very early period, any aggressive policy of absorption In regard to the Hawaiian group, a long series of declarations through three-quarters of a century has proclaimed the vital inter est of the Lnited States in the independent life of the islands and their intimate commercial dependence upon this country \t v *„* * # * coun^^iln^^d^^^ 8 *"? 6^ 11^ betWeeD re P™-tativesof this government .and governments of other mintalnine th stabilS oonf n ° ontelu f pla ' lon - Doubts which have been raised in certain quarters respecting the question of maintaining the stability of the parity between the metals and kindred questions may be solved by further negotiations Mean t"c sub e'a "ndlMs t b U ° n * T """ ** "^ d ~ -ted their ability and fitness oLISh recognS'of bo h Void anT.? * """ "^ reSUk ' D *" "««™«on.l «reement which will bring about the ZoTz^^i shirrrk sii n v o er inrusu:: e ran o oney n cr terms and with such sareguards as ■» — the « •* ** — *** *** V PACIFIC ROADS-In so important a matter as the government becoming the possible owner of railroad property which it perforce must conduct and operate, I feel constrained to lay before congress the facts for its consideration and action before the consummat on of the sale.

But whether the government, rather than accept less than its claim, should become a bidder and thereby the owner of the property, I submit to the congress for action. * * * INDIAN PROBLEM-Thc secretary of the interior reports that leading Indians have absorbed great tracts of land to the exclusion of the common people, and government by an Indian aristocracy has been practically established to the detri ment of the people. It has been found impossible for the United States to keep its citizens out of the territory, and the exe cutory conditions contained in these treaties with these nations have for the most part become Impossible of execution. Friends of the Indians have long believed that the best interests of the Indians of tho five civilized tribes will be found iii American citizenship, with all the rights and privileges which belong to that condition. • • • I concur with the secretary of the interior that there can be no cure for the evils engendered by the perversion of these great trusts except by their re sumption by the government which created them. *** # * # * # # REClPßOClTY— Negotiations are now pending with several governments, both European and American. It is beljeved that by a careful exercise of the powers conferred by that act some grievances of our own and of other countries In our mutual trade relations may be either removed or largely alleviated, and that the volume of our commercial exchanges may be en larged, with advantage to both contracting parties. * * ** ARBITRATION— The best sentiment of the civilized world is moving toward the settlement of differences between na tions without resorting to the horror 3of war. Treaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines without in any way imperiling our interests or our honor shall have my constant encouragement. *** « * * * * * NAVY'S NEEDS— The great increase of the navy which has taken place in recent years was justified by tho requirements for national defense, and has received public approbation. The time has now arrived, however, when this Increase to which the country is committed should, for a time, take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels. *** # * * * * * ALASKA— The territory of Alaska requires the prompt and early attention of congress. The conditions now existing de mand material changes in the laws relating to the territory. The great influx of population during the past summer and fall, and the' prospect of a still larger immigration In the spring will not permit us to longer neglect the .extension of civil author ity within the territory or postpone the establishment of a more thorough government. M'KINLEY IS HURRYING HOME. CANTON, 0., Dec. 6.— At 10:30 o'clock Mrs. McKinley was exceedingly low. She had just experienced one of the sinking spells, during- which life seems to be almost extinct. There were mo ments when she did not -seem to breath. If she rallies from this spell she will probably survive the night. Her pulse was weak and uncertain, more so than at any other time and her breathing was difficult. The physician when he last called reported that she had weak ened perceptibly. He has not despair ed that she will survive the night, but he cannot feel confident of it. The latest advice received from the presi dent is that he will come in by regular train, which will reach here at 10:26 a. m. A special may possibly be run from Pittsburg. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— President McKinley left Washington at 7:20 o'clock tonight to return to the bed- CLIPPING THE DEFICIT. Special to the Globe. WASHINGTON. Dec, 6.— Gen. Bing ham, of Pennsylvania, is chairman of the subcommittee in charge of the legislative, executive and judic ial appropriation bill. He has a great task laid out for him. It is noth ing less than a report of a thorough reorganization of all departmental work. It is all to be done for the sake of economy and his report is to be presented to congress as early this week as possible. The present estimates of the various departments called for over a million more dollars than was given last year. The administration has determined to economize and when this amount was brought to the notice of the president he called for an explanation. None being forthcoming he determined on an investigation, and when Congressman Cannon, of Illinois, chairman of the full committee on appropriations, reached the city, he received an urgent invita tion to visit the White house. As a result of his visit word was passed along that all appropriations would have to be cut to the bone, and Gen. Bingham was directed to thoroughly investigate the operations of the de partments. He began his investiga tion today. The chief of each division in every department in the city has been noti fied to appear before Gen. Bingham and his subcommittee. Each chief is required to bring with him the name of each clerk who is under his direc tion, his salary, and the work done. Chiefs will further be expected to in form the committee whether the work of a division could be done by a less number of clerks and at a less expense. The investigation is the most far reach- Ing in the history of the government, and the administration expects that a saving of many, millions of dollars will bi; the result if the recommendations, which the subcommittee will make, are acted en favorably 6y congress.

With him were Mrs. McKinley, Miss Mabel McKinley, Miss Barber, Mr. Abner Mc- Kinley, A. J. Duncan, two maids and the steward of the White house. The party occupied the special Pullman, Newport, which was attached to the rear of the regular Western express. According to schedule, the train is due in Canton at 10 o'clock tomorrow morn ing, but upon the receipt of unfavor able news from Canton, it may be rushed through on special time from any point beyond Baltimore. 

CANTON, 0., Dec. 6.— lt was an agreeable surprise for the children and friends gathered about the bedside of Mrs. Nancy Allison McKinley this af ternoon when she regained conscious ness sufficiently to recognize not only her children, but to extend greeting to them, to her aged sister, Mrs. Osborne; Charles Miller and to others who were Word Has Been Passed That Appropriations Must Be Cut. the work and in an interview with your correspondent today said: "There is no doubt in my mind but that the departmental work of the government is run on a most extravagant Bystem. It is the aim of the investigation, which has been begun, to show this to congress. The de partments this year ask for over a million more dollars than was appropriated at the last session. We have begun tho work and expect to carry it on most thoroughly. We have already found that In the state depart ment, where there are only from 70 to SO clerks, seven chiefs of division are needed, while in the record and pension office of the war department two chiefs of division direct the operations of 500 or COO clerks. If such a thing is possible in the record and pension office, what is the necessity of such a num ber of chiefs in the state department? In the past, clerks have been promoted to chiefs of divisions in many cases simply to give them an increase of $200 or $300 a year In salary. This system has been continued and the time has come for a change. "The Dingley law has not been in opera tion long enough to produce the revenues that its friends believe it will produce in the future. If we can economize to the extent of several millions of dollars in departmental work we should do it, for we have not the money in the treasury now to stand extrava gant appropriations. But economy is not only to be applied to the departments. It is to be the watchword all through this session of con gress. All appropriations are to be cut. Enough money will be given to carry on all contracts now in operation, but new improve ments will. I think, stand but little chance." And all of this spirit of reform was inaugurated, primarily, because an un ostentations newspaper correspondent recently printed some facts concerning the highway robbery of extravagant appropriations. —Smith D.

Dec. 6.— The delegation of native Hawaiians who have come to this country to present a protest against a rati fication of the annexation treaty, reached Washington today. They are Col. John Rich ardson, James H. Kaulia, William Auld and D. Kalaukalani. They were not ready to make any statement concerning their mission beyond the fact that they were here to pre sent a protest, adding that thry would be able to say more in a day or two.

The first nourishment re ceived for several days had a telling effect, and she at once rallied. There is again strong hope that she may re cover sufficiently to survive until the president reaches her bedside tomor row morning and perhaps to recognize him. It is not thought, however, that she will ever regain complete conscious ness. When the attending physician left Mrs. McKinley this evening it was with a feeling that she will survive the right and possibly longer. She has taken no nourishment since early in the afternoon and was not in quite as good condition as when sin- Beemed to recognize those about her. But sh> sustained little net loss of strength dur ing the day and was reposing in a quiet and seemingly natural condition. During nearly the entire night the family remained in the sick room, ex pecting every moment to be th<- last one. The patient had a number of the sinking spells such as occurred during Sunday, and each one of them, as it approached, was feared to be the last one. As morning approached, however, she quieted down materially, and hope became stronger. At an early hour the president was advised th;it his mother was still living, although con siderably weaker than she hail been. He was also informed that she \\;<s resting easily, and gradually passing away without any suffering. The doctor called early and at 3 o'clock he announced that while the patient was mm-h weaker than at any other visit, that she was resting bo quietly then that she might survive for some little time. j~\* '**$'''/£ v&f\ jrt %ff s%. 

PRESIDENT SAM, OF THE HAVTIIV IllOl'l BLIC. 10 PfIGES. GERMAIN GUNS ARE SHOTTED. Hayti Given Eight Hours to Comply With the Demands. TWO CRUISERS ARE AT PORT AU PRINCE. State of Great Excitement. Strong Force of Troops on the Scene to Prevent Riot ing and Disorder on Shore. FORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, Dec. 6.— The trouble between Germany and Hayti, as a result of the arrest and Imprisonment of Herr Leudero, an alleged German subject, reached a cri sis today. Two German cruisers enter ed this port during the morning, and an ultimatum from the German gov ernment was delivered to the Hay thin government, giving the latter eight hours in which to grant the demands of Germany for an Indemnity to Herr Leuders. In anticipation of trouble, th<- <iti zens of German nationality sought re fuge yesterday on board two steamers which were at this port and the French steamer Vllle de Marseilles has been requisitioned by the French minister In order to serve as a place of refuge for French citizens. The Vllle de Mar seilles has arrived here direct from Porto Rico. The population of this place is In a state of great excitement, but the Haytlan government has strong forces of troops at Its disposal and is resolved to maintain order. The population of the city late thin afternoon, when this cablegram is b -nt, appears calm and the present indica tions seem to confirm the supposition that the government will accept the conditions imposed by Germany so far as money indemnity is concerned, and it is also probable that, yielding to su perior force ami in order to avoid in ternal troubles, the government will accept the other conditions.
