Special to the Glooe. Fall River, Mass., Dec. 12.— A well dressed, middle-aged woman came to this city from Boston yesterday In search of her sixteen-year-old daughter, who had left her home last Saturday. The girl had been traced by detectives to this city, where she arrived on the steamboat train, accompa nied by a young man. The mother re mained at a hotel until evening, when, accompanied by a detective, she vis ited tlie house where her daugh ter was stopping, one of the most notorious resorts in the city. En trance was obtained without difficulty and they were at once ushered into the parlor, where, with other inmates of the house, were the daughter and her betrayer. The mother, after one glance at the pair, gave j a shriek, and with the words. '"Brother and sister," fell in a faint. The daughter rushed to her mother and endeavored to restore her to consciousness. When she came to she told an almost unparalleled story. Some twenty years ago, it appears, the mother resided with her parents on a farm in the West. On an unlucky day a New York merchant visited the village on business and being attracted by the un sophisticated farmer's daughter, succeeded in winning her affections. It was the old story. Her parents drove her from home and she found refuge in a Catholic insti tute, leaving her child, a boy, with them. She went out into the world to fight her own battles. Fortune favored her. and in time she went to Boston and became the wife of a respectable man. by whom she had one daughter. Her husband knew nothing of her past life, but she bad kept trace of her boy and managed, without disclosing rela tionship, to bring him to Boston and edu cate him. Without knowing their relation ship, he managed to form the acquaintance of his half sister for dishonorable motives. The clandestine acquaintance was unknown to their mother and she was horror stricken when she came face to face with her daughters betrayer. The young man was astonished when he heard this strange story from his mother's lips. He went immedi ately to New York, and the heart-broken mother, with her erring daughter, returned to Boston. lEoat the Butterine Makers. Chicago. Dec. 12. — One of the most novel yet successful schemes of thievery which has been unearthed in Chicago for some time was broken up yesterday by the surest of John Flatters, Thomas Parker, John Cnrtin and Henry Evans. These four personages are principals in the scheme by which a butterine manufactur ing firm lias been swindled out of about g1,500 in the last two months. Flatters was a teamster in the employ of the firm, and his business was to go to the stock yards every morning and bring thence to his employers in a large wagon lard and other truck to the amount of about 5,000 pounds each load. The material was weighed when he received it and on his re turn it was again weighed by a public weigher within a couple of blocks of the butterine establishment, this method being adopted by the concern to save time and annoyance. Flatters bethought himself of a money- making scheme in connection with his work, and was assisted by Parker, who is a BUTCHER OWNING A SIIOP, 802 West Taylor street. On his way from the stock yards Platters would drive to Parker's place and deliver 2so to 300 pounds of lard. Then at some point on the journey to the city scales would take on Curtin and Evans, whose combined weight would ex actly make up the deficit, and, concealing them under the large tarpaulin that covered the load, would drive on to the scales, re ceive a certified check, which corresponded with the first weighing and deliver it at his employer's office. Curtiu and Evans would be left oil stealthily after leaving the scales. A member of the firm, becoming suspicious of the weights, put the case into the hands of detectives, who, after shadowing the parties long enough to obtain sufficient evidence of guil., arrested all. on being confronted with the evidence of guilt, the four worth ies outrivaled each other in "squealing." Parker paid Flatters $10 per day. and the two tramps received from Flatters enough to keep them in beer and food. Parker had 5823 in his possession when ar rested. All were held in 000. Wrecked in a Gale. Detroit, Mich., Dec. 12. — The steamer Oconto, which was wrecked on Chanty island, leftOsceda on Friday. Dec. 4. at 4 ]>. in., with twenty-three passengers and a crew numbering twenty-live men. Shortly after they encountered a terrible gale and blinding snow storm. The sea was so heavy that the boat would not answer her helm the greater part of the time. The starboard bulwarks were stove in. and all of the upper railings, two of the lire boats and all the light freight on the hurricane deck were washed away in a short time. The vessel labored heavily in the trough of the sea till nearly midnight, when a light supposed to be the Tawas light, was sighted. It proved to be Charity Island light In about fifteen minutes the boat Ftrack. One of the crew, who arrived here yesterday, says: As soon as the boat struck the crew began dealing out life preservers. After we had got ready for the ice bath, in which none of us could have lived fifteen minutes, we discovered that there was no leak. When day broke we set our colors at half-mast and began blowing the whis tles. About 10 o'clock we sighted the lighthouse keeper and his assistant on shore. We got our small metallic life boat over the side and in it five of us went ashore. There we found two fish huts. We then brought the passengers ashore. There were twenty-three in all. Two ladies and a child were taken direct to the lightkeeper's house. The men began keep- Ing house in the fish huts. They have food enough to last them two or three weeks and rr.EXTY OF BLANKETS. Monday morning a party consisting of Frank Teeper, an assistant engineer, John Van Slykv. son of the owner of the Oconto; Anthony Potts, a passenger, and four of the crew started for the main land, and after a terrible struggle in the ice. succeeded in making shore about eight miles below Caseville Monday night. Eight men of the crew and passengers arrived at East Tawas yesterday afternoon, coming in a yawl to Point Lookout and walking from there. At the time of leaving there they had not heard anything of the fate of seven of the crew, who it is reported left for shore on Tuesday. Those remain- Ing on the island have enough to eat for a few days, but are very down-hearted. The life-saving crew have started for the island from East Tawas. The following names of passengers on the Oconto are all that are obtainable at present: G. Douglas. Lexington. Mich.; Fred Wolf. Forestville: William Carr. Canada; William Bradley, Lexington; Mr. Richmond, Sand Beach; Moses Lavor, wife and child. Alpena; James Farley, Sanilac; Philip 2seulougu, I Alpena; William Savage, Detroit; Anthony j Potts, Forestville; Fred Latham. A dispatch from Port Austin says the ) Winslow. with a barge in tow, passed there ■ this morning for the relief of the stranded j propeller Oconto. The relief vessels were making good progress through the drift ice. Mate Leardon of the Ocouto, who headed, the party that came ashore on Thursday:, night, says it will be useless to try to pull j j the Oconto- off this season, and that she will probably become a total wreck where .she lies. East Tawas, Mich., Dec. Capts. Kirke and Plough of the life-saving service left this morning with a self-bailing boat for the rescue of the Oconto's passengers, off Charity island. They will ferry the j passengers across to Point Lookout. Heavy Fire at Cedar Rapids. Special to the Globe.

Frustrated Bank Kobbery. . Wheeling. W. Ya., Dec. 12. — An at tempt to rob the First National bank of Mt. Pleasant, at an early hour yesterday morn ing, was frustrated by an accidental discov ery. A number of young men were return ing from a party and found a horse and buggy standing unhitched in an alley near the bank. Examining, they discovered under the seat a black oilcloth bag contain ing powder and a quantity of fuse. Their suspicions being aroused by. the discovery the party hurried to the bank, where they could detect footsteps and the sound of blows in the direction of the safe. The men proceeded to arouse the president, R. W. Chambers, and the cashier, J. K. Itatcliff, and they hurried back to the bank. By this time the burglars had taken the alarm, and emerging from the building covered the crowd with revolvers. made their way to the buggy and drove rapidly in the direction of this city. The outer di ors of the vault, which are four inches tlsTc"E,° ! "were ' found to • have been drilled and blown from their hinges. Within the vault was a large burglar-proof safe, and the burglars were on the point of : at tacking this when interfered with. The pursuit was continued until the robbers abandoned their buggy and took to the woods, making good their escape. Wealthy Female Shoplifter. ■ Pittsbup.g, Perm., Dec. 12. — Mrs. Eli Crinu, a wealthy lady and the wife of a prominent county contractor, was arrested this afternoon in one of our large dry goods stores for shoplifting. In her basket was about S5 worth of goods she had taken, and at her home were found fancy articles valued at over 3100. which were identified by Home & Co. as goods stolen from them. A large amount of wearing apparel, which had not been worn, but without the price marks and therefore could not be identified, was also discovered in the house. Her husband, who disclaims all knowledge of his wife's pilfering, was greatly shocked when the detectives informed him of her arrest, and gave bail in Si, ooo for her ap pearance on Mondry. A Wisconsin Conflagration. Siieeoygan, Wis., Dec. 12. — The Crocker Chair company's buildings, were burned last night, the fire originating in the caning room. Loss, 500.000; insurance about $45,000. The fire burned until an early hour this morning, but was prevented from spreading to adjoining buildings. About 250 men will be thrown out of em ployment. Saw Mill Burned. Special to the Globe. Wadena, Minn., Dec. 13. — The news was brought in to-day of the burning of L. Paddock's steam saw mill. The mill was located on the Red Kiver about twenty miles northwest of here. The mill had just undergone a thorough repairing with new saws and an engine put in. Mr. Pad dock, who is a resident of this place, will be a heavy loser, as there was no insurance whatever. Elinor Casualties. A fire occurred at 44fi West Twenty-seventh street. New York. Friday night. The damage was small. Mrs. Dorsman was suffocated be fore she could cry for help. Pedro Martinez and Gullenno Flores, miners, were crushed by a caving wall in the Hartz coal mine near Eagle Pass, Tex., on Thursday. At Chadbourne. N. C. a colored woman went to a prayer meeting, leaving- her two children in the house. When she returned the house was on fire and the children were inside begging their mother to relieve them, but she could not without losing: her own life, and the children continued to beg until the fire burned them and hushed their voices. Friday night, when a few miles ; from Ar kansas City, the south-bound train on the Little Hock, Mississippi River & Texas rail way had an accident, caused by derailment at a small trestle bridge. The baggage and two passenger coaches were overturned and sev eral passengers and trainmen were hurt.

Randall Strongly Opposed to Making Changes at Present — Adverse Views Expressed. Trouble for the mormons.' Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 13. — The new Ed munds bill in reference to bigamy and for other purposes is evidently calculated to trouble the Mormon mind. It provides that the husband or wife of a person ac cused shall be a competent witness and may be compelled to testify. The power is conferred upon the court of commis sioners to issue an attachment without pre vious subpoena whenever there is ground to believe that witness will not obey the sub poena. ' Custody under such an attachment is limited to ten days. Prosecution may be for an offense committed within five years before the action is brought. Marriage ceremonies in all territories to be legal must be recognized by a certificate bearing the signatures of the parties concerned and the officiating officer or person, and this certifi cate must be filed in the county where the ceremony takes place. Violation of this certificate provision is a misdeanienor pun ishable by line or imprisonment. These records are to be open for inspection. Women in the territory of Utah are prohib ited from voting. The laws of the legisla tive assembly of Utah providing for the ! capacity of illegitmate children to inherit ■ property, that the prosecution for adultry can be commenced only by husband or wife, continuing or providing for the cor poration known as the Church of Latter Day Saints, are disapproved and annulled. The president is instructed to appoint twelve trustees, to be confirmed by the sen ate, to take charge of the affairs of the cor poration. The attorney general is in structed to take steps to dissolve this corpor ation, pay its debts and distribute its prop erty. THE rRESIOENT'S 

FAVORITES. Personal Relations of the Nation's . ■ Cliief With His Cabinet. Special to the Globe. Washington-, Dec. 12. The president has several favorites in his cabinet. Per haps Mr. Whitney, on account of old rela tions, has a nearer hold upon him than any of his brethren. Mr. Lamar is an especial favorite with Mr. Cleveland. He has always liked him ever since they first met last winter, but the president never be lieved that Mr. Lamar was much of a busi ness man. Now that Mr. Lamar has shown himself to be as good an executive and as good a man of affairs as was ever at the head of the interior department, the president's admiration lias redoubled. Mr. Whitney and Mr. Lamar are also especial friends and drive together very often. Mr. Endicott and Mr. Garland appesr to be making the least impression of • the cabinet officers. The president has never had an open break with Mr. Garland, but their re lations have never been the same since the Paw electric affair. The president has dropped into the habit of making appoint ments in the department of justice without ever consulting with the attorney general. A Western senator says that he was anxious to know who was to be appointed marshal in his state. The senator is a Itepublican. He did not expect to 

CONTROL THE APPOINTMENT. but he was anxious to know as early as pos sible to whom the appointment was to be given. He called upon Mr. Garland, whom he had known in the senate, and asked him to give him early information upon the sub ject. Mr. Garland cheerfully promised to comply with this request. Early in the fall the senator was in Washington. The appointment, contrary to his expectation, had been made without one word of notice to him. He called at the department o justice to remonstrate with the attorney general for forgetting his promise. Mr. Garland turned very red in the face the min ute the subject was mentioned, and then said: "1 had absolutely no knowledge of the matter, as the appointment was made without even consulting with me. It was as unexpected to me as it could have been to you." The senato: said the attorney general was so cut up and embarrassed that he changed the subject as quickly as pos sible. It will also be remembered that the attorney general was not present at the special cabinet meeting convened upon the death of Mr. Hendricks, and that Mr. Gar land did not hear of the death until mid night of the day of the special cabinet meeting. It is probable that a regular no tice of this meeting was sent to his house, but it is evident that no special means had been employed to reach him, as he was merely out spending the evening at the house of a friend near by. The prominence given to Mr. Bayard's summary of foreign affairs in the president's message shows very clearly hat Mr. Bayard still retains his strong hold upon the president. No member of the cabinet, it is said, by those who know, is more 

INDEPENDENT AND SELF-ASSEKTIVE than Mr. Bayard, and that there is no one member to whose opinions upon subjects under his direction Mr. Cleveland pays more deference than to Mr. Bayard's. Chatles Marshal of New York, who came here last spring strongly backed by Mr. Tilden, found Mr. Bayard's self-assertion too strong for him. Mr. Marshal is a man of .wealth and accomplishments. He was a candidate for the Italian mission. He went directly to the presi dent about it. The president received him very kindly, and, after several interviews, told Mr. Marshall that it would be impossible for him to give him the Italian mission, it has already gone to some one else, "but," said he. "if you are willing to take the second place, that of secretary of legation, you can have that." Mr. Mar shall said he would consider the matter and let him or Mr. Bayard know whether he would accept or not Several weeks after Mr. Marshall was a guest at Mr. Bayard's house. The occasion was an evening recep tion. Mr. Marshall lingered until nearly all the quests were gone, and then said to Mr. Bayard, after a brief explanation of the president's offer, that he would accept. Mr. Bayard cut off Mr. Marshall very abruptly and re buked him severely for presuming to speak to him upon such a matter at such a time. He denied all knowledge of the matter and could not recgnize anything in the nature of a private understanding with the presi dent unless it were in writing. Mr. Marsh all indignantly left the house and soon after departed from Washington, giving up com plfjely.his ambition to shine in the diplom atic service of his beloved country. tiwh*}.\S\ -7 : :\\KtTL,E» OF THE HOI V V ; .. "Morrison's Code Adopted. Washington, Dec. 12. — The committee on ■ rules of the house of representatives had a three-hours session to-day, and com pleted the consideration of the revision of the rules, as proposed by Mr. Morrison of Illinois. Mr. Morrison's code of rules was adopted, with a few verbal amendments, and will be reported to the house on Mon day next. The amendments to the rules which are proposed by other members of the house were acted upon, but will receive consideration at a future meeting of tne committee. Though the majority of the committee favors the distribution of the work of the appropriations committee, this object will not be accomplished until after a sharp contest in the house, which will not be in the nature of a party conflict, but will be between the friends of the Morrison code, who believe that separate distribution will result in the facilitation of business, and the opponents, who regard it unwise at this time to make such radical changes. . Randall Antagonistic. ; Washington; Dec. 12. — The Star says: Mr. Randall antagonized every amendment of the rules and gave notice he would carry his opposition to the house. He did not think j that the present was the proper time to make this departure and incorporate in the rules these radical changes. The lour other members made a number of concessions re lating to the proceedings in the house, but nothing concerning the disposal of the appro priation bills. Speaker Carlisle said to-day that when the rules are reported to the house I a reasonable time will be allowed for offering amendments and \ for debate. Mr. Randall and j his friends think that these proposed important changes should be considered in a Demo cratic caucus and asked that one be called. Speaker Carlisle is of the opinion, however, that it is not a partisan question and ought not to be made one, inasmuch as tuere is (Treat diversity of opinion of the parties on this question. If the necessary number of names Is obtained to the request for a cau cus, as there is no doubt there will be, the friends of the Morrison rules will oppose any action by caucus and believe they will be able to prevent it. Mr. Randall says that if a majority of the Democrats in caucus are in favor of the proposed changes he will ac quiesce, but he is not disposed to allow the Republicans to bring about the change. VJ 

WORTHY SICCESSORS. The Seats of the Three Cabinet Sen ators to be Well Wanned. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 12.— Lamar's suc cessor in the senate has more genuine ac tivity and business capacity than his prede cessor. He is a well-appearing man, and his friends say has a tirm hold on the people in his state. He is over six feet tall, lightly built, but springy and active on his feet. In the face, but only in the face, he does not look unlike Cerro Gordo Williams of Kentucky. He dresses with a careless make-up, and wears the typical slouch hat affected by most Southern busi ness men. The successor of Mr. Bayard, ex-Gov. Gray of Delaware, ' resembles more a good-natured physician than a lawyer or statesman. He has a full, round face, covered with a thick growth of stubby hair, which in its day has been jet, but is now well sprinkled with gray. He is a good talker, but, unlike his predecessor, will not be always splitting hairs on ques tions of constitutional law. He will make a better business senator in details than did Mr. Bayard. In the election of J.W. Dan iel to the senate Virginia contributes to the body a classical scholar and an ornate orator. He is quite young, not having turned yet his forty-fifth year. The popu larity he attained with his people comes from his power of eloquence while addressing them in reputed political cam paigns. When Hancock was nominated at Cincinnati Daniel followed Daniel Dough erty in seconding his nomination and made a speech of burning eloquence, which had a magical effect upon the delegates. It was thought, when Bayard, Lamar and Garland were taken from the senate, that the body would be materially weakened on the Dem ocratic side. This would seem, however, to be a fallacy. The trio who have been transferred to the cabinet have escaped at tention in connection with the senatorial body, and, it is to be said regretfully, they are not missed. Not Favorably Lo^Uod - . Washington, Dec. — Senators are watching the developments in the house with regard to the proposed change of rules with much interest, and generally regard the proposition to distribute the appropria tion bills among several committees of the house as an extremely unwise step and likely to lead to great extravagance. The members of the senate committee on rules, all of whom are experienced parliamen tarians and several of whom had their training in the house of representatives, are unanimous in this opinion. The reso lution embodying the proposed code of joint rules will probably be re ported to the senate on Monday and be passed without much delay and sent to the house. They embody three chief propo sitions, which, if adopted by the house, would, in the opinion of the senate commit tee and senators generally, relieve the house of most of its difficulties. The first is a requirement that the speaker's table shall be cleared every day by referring all the measures and communications upon it to the proper committees, and thus getting them into the channels of legislation at the earliest moment. The second prohibits riders upon general appropriation bills, and the third requires that during the last ten days of each session, preference shall be given in each house to measures which have already passed the other house. These requirements are already followed in the senate. Lawlcrto be Register. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 12.— Boynton of the McCarthy committee says that Lawlcr will be made register at Mitchell, Dak., but that Seisinger will remain as receiver. He was appointed by Arthur and had once been a Democratic delegate from Montana, and is still regarded as a Democrat. At Aberdeen the same gentleman says Mr. Kussell will be made receiver, but whether it is their Mr. Kussell of the territorial com mittee or another Russell, who is among the applicants, they do not know, and will call on Mr. Lainarupon Monday to find out. Delegate Gilford has his bill for the admis sion and division of Dakota all ready to in troduce at the first opportunity. He in tends to go the whole hog, lie says, in his measure, but expects some member to pre pare a bill for division alone. Postmaster Judd's Prospects. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 12. There to a gen eral belief that the excitement over the alleged fight over Postmaster Judd's con tinuation at Chicago is based on very slight foundation. In fact the refusal of the sen atorial .Republican caucus to adopt Gen. Logan's general system of making war on this class of cases has materially lessened the prospect of any successful fight against Judd's confirmation. Talks with some of ex-Postmaster Palmer's most intimate friends indicate that the plan to be adopted in his case, should it be decided by tic senate to make a fight over it, will merely delay action on the nomination of his successor and allow it to run along to the end of the session without action. It is stated this will probably be the plan to be pursued in several cases. Mr. Palmer, it is understood, sent his resignation to Senator Logan in February last, authorizing him to present it to the president if he saw fit, but Mr. Logan did not think such a course a wise one, and so pigeon-holed the resigna tion. Proceeding's of the House. Washington, Dec. 12. — The speaker laid before the house a large number of ex ecutive communications, including the an nual report of the attorney general, the sec retary of the treasury and the comptroller of the currency. Mr. Reed of Maine offered resolutions for the printing of the compilation of the revision of the rules of the house in the Thirty-sixth and Forty sixth congresses stating that they would be of use in the discussion upon the proposed change in house rules. Adopted. Mr. Buck of Connecticut presented a resolution of the Connecticut legislature, asking that a suitable law be passed for the ascertain ment and Jcounting of the electoral vote. Laid on the table. The house adjourned until Monday. Representative Weaver will introduce a bill to create a department of luoor, with a sec retary, who shall be a member of the cabins ; also a bill to provide for the election of sen ators by popular vote. 

SEEVIA SUCCESSFUL. In a Battle at Velika Izzor the Bulgarians are Beaten Back With Heavy • ' Loss. A Survey of the English Parliamentary Elections Shows That the Liberals Were Too Confident. Indications Point to a General Upris ing in Mexico — Ex-Gov. Sepul veda Released. Egyptian Rebels Repulsed— of the .Funeral Services of Alfonso at Madrid. Bulgarians Whipped. Belgrade, Dec. 12. — A telegram from the front states that a long and bloody en gagement taok place between the Servians and Bulgarians to-day. The town of Velika izzor was wrested from the possession of two batteries belonging to the first division of the Bulgarian army, who attacked the Servians. Upon finding themselves out numbered the Bulgarians made signs that they wished to surrender, The Servians, who were mostly elderly men, belonging to the second reserve, shouted in reply, "You have already deluded our children, (meaning the youth of the first reserves) in that fashion, but you will not deceive us." They thereupon etiarged upon the Bulga rians with the bayonet, scattering them in every direction. The Bulgarians left many dead and wounded on the field. The Ser vians claim a brilliant victory, and much enthusiasm is manifested in Belgrade over the success of the Servians. The military commission to demarcate a line between Servia and Bulgaria will consist of the military attaches of the Russian, German and Italian embasses at Vienna and ail Austrian staff officer. Prince Al exander of Bulgaria has telegraphed to the pone, saying he will be pleased to wel come the Turkish envoy at Philippopolis on Sunday. The Turkish cabinet is dis cussing the disquieting rumors from Athens and Belgrade. The foreign representatives have been instructed to proceed in the dis cussion of methods of mediation between Servia and Bulgaria. The army is grumb ling, saying that, in calling the reserves, the rich are favored and that only the poor are summoned to take the held. There is great uneasiness felt here by rumors con cerning the menacing attitude of the Turk ish troops on the frontier. The Mexican Revolution. Monterey, Mex., Dec. 13.—Ex-Gov ernor Sepulveda was released from impris onment by order of the military governor pro tern., Gen. Reyes, this morning. lie is only allowed the freedom of the city and is continually watched to see that he com plies with the provisions of his parole. All his guards are also at liberty, which vir tually insures against any prosecution for firing on the federal troops under Keyes. Everything is quiet, but the town is full of strange faces. . The revolutionists, under Gen. Vidal Gariza, arrived in the city last night, where they found the end they had been working for had been consummated. They immediately waited on Gen. Keyes, and the commander placed himself at the service of the federal authorities. Manuel Koderignez was not able to accompany his rorces on account of illness. Much dissatisfaction is expressed here at Gen. Reyes' appointment, but as it is only a temporary matter, no open demon stration of displeasure is liable to" occur. News has just reached here that President Diaz has appointed Gen. Ballesteras, who was secretary of war under the first Diaz administration, as 

PERMANENT MILITARY GOVERNOR of the state of Nuevo Leon, and that he left the City of Mexico to-day for this city. Reyes will only hold the office until his arrival. Gen. Trevino and Gov. Garcia have been detained in the City of Mexico, it is supposed, purposely by the federal government to allow them to depose the civil authorities and declare the state under martial rule. Four of the sol diers wounded in the engagement Thursday night have since died. Gen. Keyes has two bullet holes in his clothing and a slight scratch on his arm as reminders of the ac tion. Advices reached this city this even ing stating that Gov. Naranjo and ex-Pres ident Gonzales are in the state of Guauja jata at the head of 1,000 pronunciades. If the report is true, troubled times may be expected soon from that section, and in fact all over the re public, as the president has a strong following throughout the country and es pecially in Northern Mexico. It is there the uprisings generally commence. Gen. N'aranjo's presence there also bodes no good to the federal government, as he is one of the most popular men in Mexico. Nothing is known of the intentions of the revolters. In case of a revolution all Northern Mexico could be relied upon to furnish many men to follow the banner of rebellion, as dissatisfaction, bitter feuds and jealousies are rife between the prom inent men of that country. 

ENGLISH ELECTIONS. The liberals Lost Scores of Seats by Over-Confidence. Special to the Globe. London, Dec. 12.— The Parnelites are in no way astonished at Mr. Gladstone's present solicitude to settle the Irish ques tion. They have long known that he yearned to pose as the one British states man who was capable of grappling with that stupendous problem. He has already conferred great benefits upon Ire land, and his vast ambition, fired by the splendor of the work, made him desire to round off his glorious career with the settle ment of this most difficult of political prob lems. All this was calculated upon by the Parnellites, and it made them perfectly confident that the grand and vain old man would try and have a finger in the pie if it were in any way possible. Mr. Gladstone's utterances, both during and since the compaign, have been narrowly scanned by the Parnellites. The inference is drawn that, although he would prefer to be able to ignore Parnell through a large majority, he always left a door open through which to meet the Irish leader. Therefore, It was Parnell'a secret wish, although no body in England had yet discovered it, that Gladstone should have a small majority, just enough to swear by and to enable him to brag that after all he granted home rule from a pure motive of justice. The Liber als are daily discovering evidences that scores of seats were lost to their party in the late elections through over confidence. This optionism had lead results in two ways. It led the managers to rest content with defective organizations in critical places, and it caused thousands of Liberal electors to neglect casting their votes. The question of 

FREE TRADE VS. FAIR TRADE is being brought prominently to the front by the champions of both systems. The Cobden club has awaken 11 '! tn the aiarminsj strength of the anti-Freet aders, and declares that if their strengti: com, mi s to increase for a few years more at. tl c same rate they will probably be ahle to erfect vast fiscal changes. Alam-d at this prospect, the club is now berging its wealthy members to subscribe for a propaganda fund, with which to combat the wicked protectionists. The Tories. < n the other hand, are cleverly using Preside: t Cleveland's message to make a point in favor of protection. They say that tl c United States are so burdened with surplus revenue that they w 1 soon be compelled to remit ma y of the duties on imports not from an> Jove of free trade, but because it is necessary to spend the surplus somehow. The Liberals have issued a counter manifesto, setting forth that hundreds of thousands of people are out of work in the states as a result of protection. Your correspondent is permit ted to publish the following as embodying the views of a majority of Lord Salisbury's colleagues: Correspondent — Is the present government prepared to accede to the Parnellite demands for home rule lor Ireland? Minister — It is firmly believed that Lord Salisbury is willing to grant such a measure as would be tantnmoutit to a complete con trol of purely Irish matters. Correspondent — What subjects of legisla tion would be included in the terms? Purely Irish matters? Minister — Such matters as dock, looal rates, county boards and affairs of that cluss. Correspondent — Would such a concession be broad enough to be 

ACCEPTABLE TO THE NATIONALISTS? Minister — The measure of local self-govern ment which Lord Salisbury ia willing to concede to Ireland is perhaps not so broad as that for which Mr. Parnell secured the unity of the Irish party, but it is the widest which her majesty's government can con cede. We cannot }ro beyoud wnatl have out lined. The demands for Irish autonomy uo Enjrlish government could possibly yield to. Correspondent — \V by ? Minister — It would be giving 1 to Ireland a separate fiscal system. It would be relieving Ireiund of her share of the responsibilities lor a national debt. It would in fact be mak ine of Ireland a separate kingdom. The idea is preposterous. Correspondent. — How far does Lord Salis bury believe tbutMr. Gladstone's party would go in this opposition? Minister — The majority of the cabinet be lieve that the Lioerals would assist the Con servatives in opposing the Parnellite demand. A coalition of the Liberals with the Conserv atives is possible if it should be necessary to resist the loss of the present proper imperial control iv Irish affairs. Egyptian Rebels Repulsed. Cairo, Dec. 12. — Three thousand rebels made an attack on the town of Mograkeh. which is two miles north of Koshay. The place is garrisoned by 200 Egyptians. After several hours' fighting the rebels were repulsed. Favoring- American meats. Paris, Dec. 12. — Under pressure from the Havre chamber of commerce M. Dan tresme, the minister of commerce, has promised that a bill to abolish prohibitive duties on American preserved meats shall be introduced in the cham ber of deputies after the New Tear vacation. The president of the Paris chamber of commerce joined with the Havre delegate. In an interview with the minister, he said he demanded urgency for the measure in order to give to the Ameri can trade its former facilities. Let Them Have It. Loxdox, Dec. 12.— Mr. Herbert Glad stone, son of the ex-premier, has written a letter in which he says: Nothing could induce me to countenance a separation of Ireland from Great Britain, but if tive-sixths of the Irish people desire a par liament in Dublin to manage local affairs, in the name of justice and wisdom let them have it. Alfonso's Funeral. Madrid, Dec. 12. — The funeral services over the remains of the late King Alfonso took place to-day at the church of St. Francis the Great. The large edifice was crowded with distinguished people. All the sovereign heads of Europe were repre sented and the members of the diplomatic corps were present. The civil and military pageant was an imposing spectacle and was witnessed by an immense throng. 

VAIVDEBBILT-!J ATTORNEYS. Some Account of the Preliminaries to the Reading t>f i.tia V» il . New York, Dec. 12. — Messrs. Chaun cey M. Depew and Henry H. An derson are the attorneys representing the estate. On Monday Mr. Anderson appeared before Surrogate Rollins and spoke to him privately with reference to the probate of the will and arrangements were made for filing the will at noon to-day. Mr. Ander son was given a blank petition for the pro bate of the will, which he filed. Mr. De pew and Mr. Anderson, accompanied by the friends, accordingly appeared to-day before the probate clerk at 12:25 p. m. and the petition for probate, signed by the four sons, was presented. It set forth that William H. Vanderbilt had died on Dec. 8, and that he left a will duly signed, exe cuted and witnessed. The petition then gave the names of the heirs and their residences. Mr. Anderson informed the clerk that the sons had con cluded not to tile the original will at pres ent, and that they wanted to verify the petition they had presented. The oath was administered to them, and having verified the petition, Mr. Depew handed to the pro bate clerk two type-written copies of the will, which he said he had verified in per son. Each copy contained nineteen pages of type-written matter. Mr. Anderson stated that there were no codicils. Upon petition the clerk issued citations to the widow and daughters (the sons being peti tioners were not cited), returnable on the 30th instant at 11 a. m. The parties then left the office. Subsequently Mr. Depew said the family was well pleased with the disposition of the property, and there would be no contest of the will. Concern ing the stocks devised to the children, Mr. Depew said there was an understand ing among them that none of the stocks should be disposed of by any on© of them without consent of all the others. In this way the railroad property known as the Vanderbilt system will be preserved in its entirety, and the Vanderbilt roads will continue under con trol of the family. INTERESTING FACTS are herewith made known in connection with the famine fund for Ireland raised by the New York Herald, and the basis of which was §100,000 given by James Gordon Bennett. William 11. Vanderbilt was willing to have added to Bennett's $100,000 an equal sum, upon condition that the famine fund should all be expended in the Great West of the United States, where cereals were cheap, for food, which should be sent to Ire land in a fleet of ships which Mr. Vanderbilt offered to fit out. He also offered to land all the store of sustenance in New York from the West free of all trans portation. Mr. Vanderbilt's expressed wish in the matter was two-fold: First, that the money raised should be expended on Ameri can soil for American products, and second, that the Irish sufferers should be relieved and sustained without being obliged to pay into the hands of English landlords the money raised in America. Mr. Bennett, however, thought it best to send the cash to the other side, which Mr. Vanderbilt de clined to do. He, however, gave to the famine fund 85.000, upon condition that the fact of his gift should not in any way become known. Preparing: to Receive Parnell. Chicago.
