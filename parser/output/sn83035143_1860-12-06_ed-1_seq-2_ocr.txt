I We pabtiah this morning the last Tri'dra tin! aiesssg of James Buchanan. Ilk what wa expected, but cot what we hoped. Tb way u epea for Mr. bucharmii to re trier but honor, ia part at leajt, from tlie foul tjiioi which bar puUuted it during the hut four Tear. Tb proflitracies aod the corruption! of the Federul Government, dur ing bis Administration, are pawed, though not forgotten. No act of the President could cleanse his political robes nf the record which a ter.rchinjj Investigation bas laid be fore the world, but it waa It-It for him, had be been possessed of the spirit of patriotism and moral courage, to ciAe his last official days hU beat days, and to retir with aoai degree of credit lie saw a pjrtioa ot the country convulsed with a revolution -against constitutional act, and heard open threat of treason and rebellion aninsl that Gov. emment of which he is the head. . He kit the confederated fabric trembi under the hurried rushing to and fro ot armed men, banded together with no other purpose under baaven but tbe destruction ol the Union. He aaw. en tb other baud, a myriad of peaceable citizens, who, having committed no unlawful act, waited patindy for their exec utive Head to plant himself in the path of the horde who were arrayed against law and order. Here wat a field for the exercise of statesmanship and decision that would have given to James Buchanan, spite of ail his iniamoui antecedents, tbe credit of being till possessed of one rcmaiuing spark of na tional respect and political honor. Had he now stepped boldly forward,aud met the rebel lious aeocdert with tbe edict "Thus for tare y gone, bat, By the Eternal, no further shall ye go," he would bare retired to the shades of Wheatland with the consciousness that he had done mm act to en; ,'e him to a place among these who have Served their country. And Mr. Buchanan could not fail to see this, and know that be had, in a measure, hi futnre good name in his hands as be penned hi Message. But with the Message twfbre us, where do -e find him? Weak, viola ting, cowardly; shirking the responsibility upon the people North and the people South, opon Northern legislation, .nd most of aT, noon Congress. He dares do nothing himself, and file from on cover and another, like frightened hare when the dogs in the ken nel howL In '.he endeavor to stand between the North and South, he is consistent to tl position of neither. It is a violation of the ConstittiU n for any State to secede, bot it any Stat does leccde, no power in Congress nor out of it can prevent it. He acknowl edge it the duty of the Executive to enforce thelaws "and from bia obligation, he eanuot be absolved by any human power,-' ami yet becaase it "would be difficult, if not impossi ble, to replace" the machinery of the Fed eral Government in South Carolina, be if powerless to interfere, and chooses to wait until Congress shall pass Hws so as to more effectually carry out the designs of the Con titation,h9ping,doubtlea3,th: lrom their dis sensions, no such laws will be passed until he has left the responsible seat he now holds. Tbe Message will do no good at the South. Indeed, tb secession press has repeatedly de clared thai, let the document be what it would, It would bare no effect upon their movements. The question is still open. ' The President reviews tbe history of the Constitution ; entreats his fellow countrymen to pans before they destroy the Confedera tion; refers to the unsatisfactory aspect of foreign aid domestic affairs when he took the Presidential chair; and returns thanks for present prosperity. Our relations with Great Britain, France; Bnssia, Austria and other Continental powers of Europe, China, Japan and Brazil, are satisfactory and friend ly. Thoj with Spain, New Grensdaj Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Mexico, are leas so. Tb inflammation of the opposing parties in Kansas is due to the evil conduct of men both from the North and South. He justifies himself fcr having rubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Congress, and fc say peace reigns once more in Utah. ' ' The "Pub. Func." makes a joke about his having endeavored, from the beginning of his Presidential career, to correct extrava gance and prodigal!' y. He thinks an annual expenditure of $62,000,00 amply sufficient for all necessary expenditure of Government. He make the somewhat surtling statement that not ft single slave has been imported since hi last annual Message, in violation of tb African Slav Trade. He recommends the passage of a ltw for the election of Rep resentatives on the same given day through out tbe Union, and communicates the fact that a modification of the Tariff is neces sary. The President closes with an appeal for aid, if It can be granted by Congress, to the suffering In Kansas. For further particulars, read tbe Message entire. 1 '' Prospects for Compromise. The Washington dispatches cannot all be reliable. Those to the New Vork Tribune ay that There !s no countenance given here in Re publican circles to the new Congressional Compromise suggested in the New Vork and Albany papers. The Eepubiicaa Senators especially are a unit iu opposition, including Mr. Seward, whose position ha bt-en irppo9 ed to be compromised by his intimate relations with some of the journalists in question. ' ' While those to the New York Times say: It is understood that the Republican mem bers are a unit in favor of compromise. ; The New Hacpshire,Pennsylvnniii, Indiana Ohio, Illinois, New York, and other Republicans, have talked the thing over to night in sepa rate parties.

About t o'clock Tuesday evening, Prof. G. . C. Weber, of the Cleveland Medical College, while walk ing on Superior street near Monument Square, was violently attacked by a man whom Prof. W. recognised as a lunatic who bad been sent not long since from the Asy lum at Newburgh to undergo surgical treat ment, and upon whom Prof. W. had per formed with succena a very delicate opera lion. . The man was much stronger than Prof. W., and was completely infuriated. A notion had taken possession of him that the operation by Prof. W. was not skillfully per formed, and he had determined to seek re dress by severely punishing the Professor. No one being preser . when the attack was made, Prof. W. walked his asiailant round the Square to Ontario street on the south side, where he -ippealed to some persons who 'Were collected therefor aid in securing the man, telling them ha was a madman. No haed, however, was paid to his overture for assistance, the crowd not understanding the matter, and there being no opportunity for explanation. I he Professor, however, stood to his patient bravely, determined to secure Jiim. and constantly beseaching aid from the bystanders At length several came to his assistance, and after no inconsiderable effort, tbe wild and infuriated man was secured and lodged in jail, toawaithis removal to the Asylum. -The escape of Prut. W. from se vere personal Injury was most fortunate. Clivtiihd Philhauioxic Socixty.

' FiixviSH Ottiaqi. About a week since a most diabolical outrage was committed upon the person of a young girl in Conneaut, Ashtabula county, by a man named Cheney, who flsd. A correspondent of the Herald girt th following particalars: - Lanrentine Cheney, son of a merchant OnSooLk Ridge, about 19 years of age, called one evening a few weeks since, at th resi dence of Mr. D. A. Farnhara, a neighbor, with whom lived his sister-in-law, a young lady of about Cheney's age. The two had been quite intimate, and being alone, he at tempted (as she alleges) improper liberties, which she resisted and indignantly resented. Ha then offered her some maple sugar, which he look, tasted, and returned to him, saying she did not like it. Ebe further alleges that be forced a lump of it into her mouth, which ehe swallowed. Stupefaction, immediate and complete, resulted. On returning to con sciousness,' sh found herself lying up on the floor, Cheney gone, and her person violently outraged-A lamily consultation waa had and it waa determined to keep the matter quiet as possible eo the young lady attend ed school next day as usual. But the injury sh had received required a physician's knowledge and skill, and a doctor was call ed, who pronounced her situation precarious and dangerous.- Then it was six days after the perpetration of the crime that some motion was made toward arresting Cheney, but be had gone to parts unknown.
