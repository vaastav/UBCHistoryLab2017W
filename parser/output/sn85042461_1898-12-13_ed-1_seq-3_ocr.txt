By the time the regi ment hud reached the suburbs of Corro many hundreds' of men, women und chil dren were following, all showing deep emo tion, the men embracing one another, the women weeping from excessive pleasure and the; ohildn n shouting endearing names' as the North Carol-mans marched back. The United States, evacuation commis sioners and Gen. Greene sent ticn. Clous and. ('apt. Hart at noon today to exchange views with the Spanish commissioners. It was arranged, that all Cuban officers and soldiers, including Gen.

Garcia's death spread through Havana early yesterday evening, the Cubans wished to have all the places of amusement closed. They succeed ed in closing two place.- frequented by Cu bans, but the management of the Tacon theater, where there were many Spanish otieers among the audience, refused to close the house. Thereupon Allegretto, a forfter captain of Cuban troops-, got into an excited argument with the manager of the-theater, and Allegretto was escorted to the sidewalk by the police on duty. There Allegretto en tered into a heated d.i.-cussion with a Span ish officer, who struck him across the face with the flat of his sword. Then there was a collision between the Cubans and Spanish military men, more blows were struck on both sides and many persons from the cafes ond park cheered for Spain and brought crowds of people to the spot from adjacent streets anel squares. Suddenly n shot was fired, whether by a Cuban or by a Span iard, intentionally or accidentally, cannot lie said, and the Cubans retreated, into the Hotel Ingleterru. More shots were fired on both sides und Arturo Tizel, a French citi zen, born in. Havana, was'shot and seriously wounded while sitting at a table. More shots were fired, and Cubans ran way up stairs. Jesus Solonongo, a Cuban fell wounded on the stairs, and another wounded man broke into the room occu pied by Lieutenant Fitzhugh Lee, son of the famous general, and the former consul gen eral, demanding protection. General Greene and several members of lii»4 stuff, who had been out on a balcony watching the crowd, heard the uproar in the hotel, and went into the corridors. So soon as the Spanish officers Saw General Greene, who was in uniform, they stopped the pur salt of the Cubans, saluted and retired. In the meantime Eu-taquio I.emus hud been fatally wounded in the street and Pe dro Blesa and Senor Jiminez had been killed. Shortly afterward, the Spanish gourds on duty swarmed in from the ncigh borhoring streets, and order was restored. At the time the Cubans and pursuing Spaniards ran through the Hotel Ingleterru General Humphreys was in the lobby, talk ing with Major Martin of General Greene's srtaif, and other gentlemen. A bullet shat tered a mirror near which they stood, and two others splintered the staircase. R. S. Howland, editor of the Providence Journal, and Mr. W. L. lteilly, a New York contractor, were jostled by the sudden rush of shouting and lighting men. Gen eral Julio Sunguilly was sitting at v table in the lobby. The violent scenes in the office and OH flic- Stain lasted, however, for only v few minutes. Qtl the outside the Spanish soldiers were clearing the great square and streets In the vicinity. The hotel was full of American officers and civilians, and some of them, with their wives, were standing on the bal conies nt the imminent .risk of being hit by bullets fired at an Upward"angle to scare the crowds. Prom that point they watched the spectacle in the electric lighted square. It is reported that, in addition to those killed and wounded, who have been pre viously mentioned, fourteen are being eared for in private houses. Three arrests were made. A few minutes after the shooting in the hotel, frightened patrons and Cubans gathered around General Greene, asking if lie would protect them. He assured them that he believed they were safe, but the only recognised authority in Havana was the Spanish executive. He then sent Captain Cole and Lieutenant Stevens to General Castellanos to inquire what was being done to preserve order. The latter replieel that the cafes had been ordered closed and the streets cleared, while trccps in sufficient numbers to keep the peace had been posted in the squares and thoroughfares, Two of the aids of General Castellanos'called upon General Greene and gave him further per sonal assurances.

ANGELES HERALDi TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER J3, 1898 LIKE FIRE TO POWDER IS MENTION OF DREYFUS TO PARIS PEOPLE HOWLING MOBS IN STREETS Are Fairly Out-Howled by'the Other Mob in the Chamber of Deputies Associated Press Special Wire PARIS, Dec. 12.—The prefect of Algiers has suspended the Mayor of Algiers fur a month on account of a speech made by the -Mayor, who is a rabid anti-Semite,attack ing the Governor-General. The Minister of the Interior has increased the suspension to three months. This is meant as a warn ing to the Algerian anti-Semites, whose re cent violence und threats have been eaUs -1 ing panic among the Jews in Algiers, which has demoralized business. M. Millcvoye and the Comte dc Katnet, both members of the Chamber of Deputies, headed an anti-Dreylus demonstration this afternoon. They marched to the Chert-he Midi Prison, where Colonel Picquart IS con lined, but they were stopped By a cordon oi police and were asked to retire. There upon M. Millevoye made a speech, during which he said they "did not desire a con flict with these brave fellows," pointing to th" police, lidding that they hud achieved their object of being able to shout "spit upon Picquart," who could hear them from th- window of his prison. The crowd then marched to the Hotel dcs lnvalides, the official residence of Gen eral Zurlinden, the military governor of Paris, cheering for the army and chanting monotonously "Spit upon Picquart.' Meet ing a lieutenant of cuirassiers on their way to give him an ovation, he said: "I thank you in the name of the army." The speech brought forth renewed cheers from the demonstrators. The doors of General Zurlinden s resi dence were closed, hut the crowd gathered outside cheering for the army, and M. ilillevoye harangued his followers, denounc ing the "infamous monsters of the Court ol Cassation," ending with calling for cheers for the "valiant General Zurlinden, who commands the army," and "for the tri color living over the lnvalides.' The Comic de Hamct made a similar speech, concluding with: "The court of cassation is perverting justice, but we will not tolerate it. We are the people, and we patriots will rise against it." Again the crowd cheered frantically and marched to the chamber of deputies, where M. Millevoye and Ramel announced that they were going to apprise'the chamber of "their indignant protests. The crowd then dispersed. In the chamber of deputies M. Grousett, radical socialist,, interpellated the govern ment on the indiscretions of the general stuff in the Dreyfus affair. He read ex- j tracts from newspapers which are alleged: to have emanated from members ot the general staff, which caused a violent uproar, during which the deputies rose and rushed at one another and engaged in a series of list fight*. . M. Grousett continued his remarks in the middle of this tumult, and recalled an article in the Intransigeant referring to letters from Kmperor William and an inter view between Count yon Minister, Ger man ambassador at Paris, and M. Cusiniir Perier, the former president of the re public. Count de Mtin, the conservative leader, here interrupted the speaker and said be desired that the house be consulted as to whether the discussion should be allowed to continue. The premier, M. Dupuy, said that as the head of the government, he protested with the utmost energy against the language of the speaker, whoj he added, bad not meas ured its possible effect. (Great applause.) M. de Roulede, revisionist, shouted: "Come off the tribune!'' This caused a redoubling of the uproar. When semi-quiet was restored M. Grousett continued speaking. He said the center of resistance to the revision of the Dreyfus case was not from the ministry of war. It was elsewhere. As to the secret documents in the case he pointed out that they had been ridiculed by Emperor Will ism himself. (Loud protests.) M. de Sohanel, republican, invited the speaker not to mix foreign sovereigns in the debate any more than he would mix the president of the republic in it. M. Grousett, continuing, spoke of the articles in the newspapers, in which it was hinted that Russia and the ci'.ur were mixed tip in the Dreyfus case, und he also alluded to the recent semi-official note relative to the minister of foreign affairs, D. del Casse, being obliged to explain certain statements to the German ambassador relative to the tatter's daughter. (Uproar and hoots.) Austria, M. Grousett said, was next mixed up in the affair, The speaker said lie pointed out these matters in order to show that a press cam paign had been inaugurated by certain in terested persons to prevent the discovery of the truth. M. Crousett concluded with demanding if (he government, was disposed to permit the center of resistance to the law to pass from the ministry of war to the general staff of the military government of Paris, if it would any longer tolerate this attitude of the ringleaders , and if it would govern for the republic or tor the Jesuits.(Applause from the extreme left, and violent protests elsewhere.) The minister of war, M. de Freycinet, re pudiated M. Grousott's allegations. He snid that if there hud been some indiscre tions it was unjust und imprudent to at tack the whole army; unjust because the army was excellent, devoted to its duly and incapable of the acts charged; imprudent because it was liable to lead to a disorgan ization of the military institutions. The minister of war concluded with vig orously protesting against the accusation brought against the general stuff and the military government of Paris of resisting the law. M. Dupuy asked the chamber to close the ditOUßSion und adopt the order of the day, Which was done by a vote of 4G3 to 78. The house then adjolinied. As one of the results of the insults ex changed during the debate in the Chamber today Antide Hover, radical socialist, has sent his seconds to M. de I'oulede, revis ionist, and to M. Gauthier d't'luy, revis ionist, who characterised M. Buyer as a "whitewashed Panamais. The city is greatly excited tonight and the troops arc under arms. Colonel Picquart's release is still de layed, owing to the judicial quibbles be tween the civil and military authorities. Max Kegis, the mayor of Algeirs, who was suspended by the prelect for a month on account of a rabid anti-Semite speech he made attacking the governor general, has resigned. Comic Esterhazy has written M. Muzenu, president of the court of cassation, de claring his readiness, if granted a safe con duct to appear before the.court to be con fronted with all the witnesses and to de tend his own honor and that of the lute Colonel Henry.

REICHSTAG DEBATERS TALK OP GERMANY'S FOREIGN POLICY ARE PROBLEMS TO SETTLE But the Teuton Hopes to Avoid Wai and Retain Good Will of the United States Associated Press Special Wire BERLIN', Dec. 12— JDuring the course of the debate on foreign, affairs iv the reichstag today Herr Richter, the German Radical leader, expressed the opinion that Emperor Wilhelm's tour of the Holy Land had left a mixed imipession in. the niintlsof the Protestants. I The Radical leader also said no unneces sary osLacles should c placed in the way ot the importation o£ American products. He | then advocated a new army bill, but said it was of such proportions that it did not har monize witli the sympathy expressed in th« speech from the throne on the subject of the czar's disarmament proposals. Count Posael'owshyAVeinher, imperial sec retary of state for the interior, replied. Re fering to the alLcgedl uneasiness) us to the con dition of public affairs, he said] that in his opinion the situation both at home and abroad was favorable. Baron yon jiuelow, former secretary, dwelt at length upon, foreign, affairs. He | said that tho eastern question at the pres ent moment was peaceful, and much less ! threatening to the peace of the world, I though he did not mean to imply that the j problem was settled. Discussing Emperor William's recent tour, Raton yon Buelow said that its result had disproved all the stories disseminated as to adventurous plans and opposing claims. The German Protestants would allow no one to dispute their right to have a house of God in holy places. With regard to Germany's relations to Great Britain, Baron yon Buelow said that there were various matters in which Ger many could proceed in company with Eng land, and that willingly, without prejudice to and with the fullest maintenance of othei valuable relations. Then, turning to Ger many's attitude toward the Spanish-Ameri can war, he said: "Our duty has been to take care that Germany's relations with neither Spain nor America should be disturbed. Germany has no special interest in Cuba, and it is not for Germans to judge who was right or who was wrong. Therefore the German gov ernment has observed a loyal neutrality. Never during the war did the government show, or even feel, any inclination toward ; unwarranted intervention. "In a straightforward manner, within the bounds of strict neutrality, and with out prejudicing our relations- with either belligerent, we did. everything in our pow er to prevent Injury to German shipping and trade. (Cheers.) Various differences of principle existed In our commercial re lations with America, but the negotiations that were stopped during the war will be resumed, and I may venture to believe that, with mutual good will, the friendly relations between Germany and the United States will be maintained In the field of commerce." , In concluding. Baron yon Buelow said: "Governments everywhere are endeavor ing to preserve the peace, and Germany hopes to succeed for a long time to come In avoiding serious conflicts. True to its historic traditions and the emperor's ,-roat alms, the German nation, while protecting to the fullest Its right and interest and mindful that its future depends upon Its strength and' the sharpness of its siword, will nevertheless never fall, when the uni versal aims of humanity or the mainte nance of the world's peace and commerce are Involved."

Broadway Laughlln Building FIFTY-YEAR FRANCHISE REFERRED TO THE RAILROAD COMMITTEE Citizens of Chicago Pin Their Faith to the Effective Veto of Mayor Harrison CHICAGO, Dec. 12—The ordinance ex tending the franchises of the Chicago street car companies for titty years came up in the I city council tonight and was referred to the council committee on railroads. On all votes touching the ordinance the inonds of the measure were a strong minority, but unless they can! mus>ter much greater j strength there is no probability that they ] will ever be able to pass, it over the veto of i Mayor Harrison. Contrary to general expectation there was little excitement around the city hall, and although the council chamber was packed to suffocation and a crowd lillcd the out side corridors, the number of people pres ent was but little larger than usual. The crowd was, however, against the franchise proposition to a man, and made no pretense of keeping it a secret. Adherents of the franchise were openly hissed when they at tempted to gain a point for their measure and loud yells greeted the announcement •of the vote by which the ordinance was referred. Alderman Mclnerney made a speech to a certain extent defying the spirit shown by the galleries, and from that time to the adjournment he was the object of numerous remarks from the outsiders, many of them being warmly personal. The crowd, however, was good-natured. The railroad committee, which now has the ordinance in charge, is composed cf thir teen members, eleven of whom tonight voted as friends of franchise extension.

TRIPLE ALLIANCE To Inlclude Great Britain, America and Japan LONDON, Dec. 13—Ihe Paris corre spondent of the Daily Mail summarizes this morning an interview he had with United States Senator Cushman K. Davis of the peace commission, who advocates a triple nlliance between the United States, Great Britain and Japan. The correspondent says: "Mr. Davis declared that British and American interests in the far east run quita parallel, and that, therefore, the two pow ers sliould act jointly. " 'I am not appealing to sentiment,' ha said, 'though blood is thicker than water, and this argument should not be ignored. My memory in favor of co-operation is borne out by the coldest logic. I favor a treaty of alliance including the United States, Great Britain and Japan for the protection of all their interests north of the equator. The rest of the world would have a wholesome fear, synonymous of respect, for us.' "He proceeded to argue that Russia, Ger many ant'j Fiance had secured the great bulk of the commercial benefits in China, to the exclusion of both the United States and England. He suggests that such a drci bund could have nothing to fear from any coalition of other nations, and that, there fore, it would tend to preserve the peace. " 'So far as the Philippines are con cerned,' said Mr. Davis, 'there will be an open door, but not free trade. Our pro tection policy will be applied without favor ing any nation, and the needs of our new. territories will be considered."
