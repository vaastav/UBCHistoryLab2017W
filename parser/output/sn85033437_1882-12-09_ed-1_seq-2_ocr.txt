Garret, Jas. Swagarty and Alex. Roadman, four colored men of Cocke County, sign an address to "the colored people" and publish it in the Newport Sen tine), a foiteful little Democratic newspaper. Of cours?, this address was writ ten by a Democrat, and for Demo cratic purposes. It is full of mis representa tions. We quote theclos ing paragraphs: "If these RDubueans are our best friend, why have.we not been given at last one member of the Legislature from Est Tennessee, 'soeciailv in the district of Mr, Houk, or Mr. Pettibone, where Re publicans claim to have everything theJr own wav? "Middle and West Tennessee, where the great Democratic majori ties pile up, have given ine comreu Tifionlft thripe memoers. wi cuuu ed voters think of these things." Now. the funny thing about the above is that these three colored mfimhfira are all ReDUblican?, and were opposed by the Democrats. The Democrats in Shelby County nominated two colored men on their Legislative ticket in order to humbug the colored voters, Enough colored men were thus humbugged into voting the Demo cratic ticket to elect all the white Democrats on the ticket; but the white Democrats refused to vote for these two colored Democrats, and thus defeated them. If colored men want to be Demo crats because they love Democratic principles, let them join that party, But if colored men join tne Lem ocratic party in order to have Democrats elect them to office, they wilTfind out what their humbugged brftthren in Shelby learned last November that the Democrats prefer a white Republican to a black Democrat, Swagerty and the two Garretts are merely three catpaws to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Demo- crate to eat ; and all the reward they will get will be singed paws. WASHINGTON LETTER. Cone-res Tbe President The Cabinet What Will be Done. Washington, December 6, 1882. Notwithstanding the fact that the session of Congress just opening expires by limita tion on the fourth of next March, the feel ing is strong that in these three months will be passed a great deal of very important and useful legislation; more, probably, than has been effected by any session, long or short, for years past. So far as bills yet introduced go, they re late to taxation, purity of elections and civil service reform. The tax bills so far intro duced are simply crude propositions, grow ing out of undue haste on the part of certain members to make a record for speed in proposing the abolition of all internal revenue laws. The ways and means committee have, however, agreed on one important measure, namely: the aboli tion of all internal revenue taxes on 

TOBAOOO. This will likely be agreed to. Judge Honk's bill for preventing fraud and intimidation at elections, and insuring a fair expression and faithful recording of the will of the people, has met with much favorable comment, and is likely to receive the general support of both houses. Kasson has a bill establishing some fixed term for subordinate officers and employes of the government, and something will be done in this direction, xear after year a feeling has grown that it was necessary to do away with the uncertainty which is at the bottom of much demoralization of the civil service. THE PBESXDENT'S MESSAGE and the accompanying reports of the heads of departments bristle with suggestions for Congress to work out. The most import ant suggestions, of course ; relate to internal revenue and tariff reductions. The President recommends the removal of all internal revenue taxes save those on whisky, and a general overhauling of the tariff, to relieve it from crudities and unjust provisions which are to-day the main source of whatever weakness afflicts it. The Sec retary of the Treasury does not go quite so far, but recommends retaining the internal revenue tax on whisky, beer and tobacco. Probably Congress will remove the tax from tobacco, and all other articles included the internal revenue laws, except whisky and beer; or, to speak exactly, "dis tilled spirits" and "fermented liquors." As to the tariff, it is not thought that changes in it will be in the direction of de parting at all from the protective system, which has built up the manufactures of the country and made us a nation instead ol a colony, but that there will be such a reduc tion as is demanded by the need of reducing our revenues to an amount only sufficient for the economical administration of the government, and the prompt payment of its obligations as they fall due. The tariff laws now in force were sub stantially made up during and just after the war, at a time when the enormous cost of the rebehon made it necessary to tax to the uttermost whatever would yield revenue to meet the extraordinary expenses of the government, and whoever came before Congrnsn and painted out something that could be taxed was looked upon as a public benefactor. Of course some "jobs" got into the system, many of which have since been removed, but some of which remain. And beside this, some taxes were put at a figure then imperatively demanded by the needs of the government, but which neither reve nue nor protection now require to be kept at so high a point. Yet, what would have been an unbearable burden to any other country in the world, has been a great and positive benefit to'our own. First, it has raised large revenues which have gone to rapidly diminish the principal and reduce the rate of interest on the public debt; and, second, it has greatly stimulated our manu facturers at home, bringing about competi tion which has given us all sorts of manu factured goods at half the price they would cost to-day if we de pended on foreign manufacturers. And while we have been reaping this result on the one hand a very large class of skilled mechanics has grown up making the very best kind of a home , market with good prices for the productions of our farmers. Hut now the very prosperity and growth which this 

GBEAT NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Has produced is bringing in an amount of revenue so greatly in excess of the needs of the government, either for its current ex penses or to pay such parts of the public debt as it can now reach that tne imperative need is a reduction of taxation not only to pre vent extravagant appropriations, but to escape contraction of the currency through the accumulation of excessive revenues. A few ears ago the country was stagger ing under a load of debt that would have crusnea any other country that ever ex isted on the face of the earth. To-day its greatest need is to guard against excessive accumulation of revenue. Nothing that man could speak or write (would go so far to prove the wisdom and honesty of Re publican administration as this single fact The president ana the Secretary of the Treasury, fully alive to this condition of things, and strenuously advocating the strictest economy m the expenditure of public money, come forward with the recommendations calculated to give the country the fullest benefit of this state of prosperity, and both the President's nies sage and the report of Secretary Folger are generally commended as the ablest papers of the kind that we nave Had in many years. Tne report of the Tariff Commission supplements the executive recommenda tions ; and this, with the fact that the tariff commission bill was passed by the Republi cans in Congress, in perfect good faith, makes it very probable that congress will in a short session, do a great deal of good work. THE 

POLITICAL OTJTLOOX is improving day by day. in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa and elsewhere in the Northern btatea the Be publicans were in a condition of apathy and indifference, peevish, foolish, all the more so that there was no reason lor it Once in a while a man gets into a condition of biliousness and general enssedness. where ne win make more fuss and noise over a sore finger or a pimple on his nose than he would, in a decent frame of mind, over a broken leg. Any fool can lead him then, provided he leads him in the direction of some folly or deviltry. Over-security, idle nebs, the lies of - malignant newspapers re peated and reiterated for years past, had combined in many Northern btates to get the party into a peevish, fidgetty condition and a lot of the sorriest, broken-down sore headed and sore backed political hacks took advantage of the state of affairs to raise a howl against the President, against "bosses," and the Lord knows what; and they managed to lead off enough men to defeat the party in inany States. It was 18740 ver again. The result has shown the foolish followers of these false leaders the mistake of being led by them. They brought up , in the ditch with a generally sprained system, just escaping broken necks, and they have had enough. Now they are getting together to meet the dan ger their folly has produced, have forgotten their pimples and sore fingers and are rubbing the lini ment of truth into their sprains and bruises, and will be on hand ready for earnest and honest Bepubliean work when the next election comes along. Meantime the President, who has been the subject of more unjust abuse than any of bis predecessors, is calmly and steadily pursuing his way as A 

OOOB PBE8EDENT And good Republican, and as the smoke of the battle clears away the people are finding out that he has shown more wisdom and steady devotion to the good of the party than any other of our leaders. That the only policy he - had was to build lip and strengthen the party in the South, where it needed strength, leav ing it to take care of it&elf in the North, where it was abundantly able to win if so disposed. In the South we have had great gains, and there only are we free from great losses and disasters. Bat the pendulum will swing back in the .north, and the good work in the South will continue, and in 1884 we shall be all on hand. Meantime we shall get a good deal of help from a Democratic House. Their general cossedness is bred in their bones and is bound to come out in the flesh. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Comment's and Criticisms. The President's message will, like 1 his previous utterances, take rank as a creditable State paper. Washing- j ton Star (ind.) It will soon be forgotten by the country, for tne .President may be trusted quickly to revive attention to himself as an omce-filledr and an office emptier. Albany Argus (Dem.) The plain unpretending style of President Arthur's message, and the good sense of his views, will com mend it to the approval of the coun try. Pmladelpbia Kecord (Ind.) It is the sort of message the coun try has leared to expect from PresiN dent Arthur plain, frank, straight forward, business-like, with no ats tempt at fine writing or nonsense of any kind. Hartford Uurrant (Hep.) The message transmitted to Con gress by President Arthur, yesterday, is interesting in its relation of facts and its presentation of the govern ment finances, but calls for little comment. Trenton True Ameri can (Ind.) .President Arthur's message is an excellent one, and will please the country very much. It is sensible throughout, and sensitive to public opinion, tie improves upon his po sitions of last year, and advises Congress .in the main wisely. Springfield Republican (Ind.) The President stands squarely on the platform of progressive Repubs licanism. He evades no issue, and his recommendations are of the plainest description. NewHaven Palladium (Kep.) This second message of" President Arthur is less striking and impressive than the first. The message of a year ago, wnen ne was fresh in tne chair, was a masterly state paper published in style, elevated in tone and statesmanlike in its grasp. The present document is less finished, less original, less torceiul. It is rather a commonplace and jejune Anirrmfi of rirv icl.atiar.ips and dull r- . mi ' m -i vi i t ports. The Philadelphia Press (Rep) it is a document tnat will repay the most careful perusal, and cannot but convince every reader that its author has closely studied that vast range of important subjects that come within his jurisdiction $ has dealt with them in a spirit of judicial fairness, and has arranged his state ments oi tact and conclusion in a concise, dignified and graceful man ner. Albany Express (Rep.) His wnoie message is that of a cau ious executive who had no very emphatic views to advance, but de sires to conduct the public business with credit and to show that he has overlooked none of the subjects which traditionally belong in a President's message, from the Japas nese indemnity to polygamy in Utah. The document will be referred to the appropriate committees, and' the country will go on as before. Phila delphia Times (Ind.) England Begins to See that America Exists. London Times. We can no longer exist without America. The country of which, witnin recent memory, we were childishly and vindistively jealous, now proves to be the country by which to a great extent we live. It sends us corn by the hundreds of ship-loads. Its beef competes with ours, or rather becomes ours, and is sold at our . native prices, under the hands of the enterprising Enerlish butchers. While to the Roman poet the tnougnt ol getting fash from the Caspian was. the thought of odious luxury, with us, it is the classes that cannot afford the Tay or the Tweed that send to the Columbian river for their salmon. But the idea of a growing America, and of a Canadian Dominion which is rapidly increasing in wealth and numbers, is much more than the idea of a new market and a new source of Bupply. - It is an idea wnicn aliects tne whole of the po ht'.cal life of Europe. We see a new Europe. We see a new Europe, as it were, erowinsr ud on the other side of the Atlantic ; and though their problems are for the moment not ours, and though they resolve to keep aloof from our affairs, their very exisience nas its innaence on us. Little by little the political ner. spective alters; the world is seen to contain other nations than the three - . . r or four which have been used to con siaer memseives as tne only pro gressive and truly civilized nations.
