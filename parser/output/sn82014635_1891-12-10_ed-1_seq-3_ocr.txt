In pursuance to the ocean mail law of March 3, 3891, and after a most careful study of the whole subject and frequent conferences with shipowners, boards of trade and others, advertisements were issued by the postmaster general for fit tv-three lines of ocean mail service tea to Great Britain and the continent, twenty-seven to South America, three to China and Japan, four to Australia and the -Pacific islands, seven to the "West Iudies and two to Mexico. It was not, of course, ex pected that bids for all these lines would be recived or that service upon them all .,.ii Ua nr.ntr-nof-.Afl for. Tt-was intended, in furtherance of the act, to secure as many new lines as possible, while includ ing in the list most or all of the foreign lines now occupied by American ships. It xvas hoped that a line to Englaud. and perlmps one to the continent, would be secured; but the outlay required to equip such hues wholly with new ships of the first class, and the difficulty of establish-in"- new lines in competion with those al ready established, detered the bidders whose interest had been enli.sted It is hoped that a way may yet be found of over coming these difficulties. The Brazilan Steamship company, by reason ofamis culculation us to the speed of its vessels was not able to bid under the terms of the advertisement. The policy of the department was to se cure from the established iines an improv ed service as a condition of wiving to them f he benefits of the law. This, in all in stances, has been attained. The postmas ter general estimates that an expenditure in American ship yards of about $10,000,000 will be necessary to enable the bidders to construct the ships called for by the ser vice which they have accepted. 1 do not think there is any reason for dicourage ment or for any turning back from the Eolicy of this legislation. Indeed, a good eginnine has been made, and, as the sub ject is further considered and understood by capitalists and shipping people, new lines will be ready to meet future pro posals and we may date from the passage of this law the revival of American ship ping interests and the recovery of a fair share of the carrying trade of the world. We were receiving for foreign postage nearly $2,000,000 under the old system and tlie outlay for ocean mail service did not exceed $000,000 per annum. It is estimated by the postmaster general that, if all the contracts proposed are completed, it will require $2,L'47,8o4 for this year, in addition to the appropriation for sea and iuland postage already in the estimates, and that 1nr ti nwvr. fiwril Tfir .tw1lnr -T 11 II UO. 1893, there would probably be needed about 5GO,om NAVAL AFFAIRS. The report of the secretary of the navy shows a gratifying increase of new naval Vessels in commission. The Newark Concord, Bennington and Miantouomnh have been added during the year, with an aggregate of something more than 11,000 tons. Twenty-four warships of all classes are now under construction in the navy yards and private ship yards, but, while the work upon them is going lorward satisfactorily, the completion of the more important vessel- will yet require about a year's time. Some of the vessels now un der construction, it is believed, will be triumphs of naval engineering. When it is recollected that the work of building a modern navy was only initiated in the year 18S3 that our uaval constructors and shipbuilders were practically wituout ex perience in the construction of large iron or steel ships; that our engine shoos were unfamiliar with the building of meat ma rine engines, and that the manufacture of steel forgings for guns and plates was al most wholly a foreign industry the pro gress that has been male is not only highly satisfactory, but furnishes the assurance that the United Statei will be fore long attain, in the construction of such vessels, with their engines and arma ments, the same pre-eminence which it nttaiued when the best instrument of ocean commerce was the clipper ship and the most impressive exhibit of naval power the old wooden three-decker man-of-war. . The officers of the navy and the pro prietors and engineers of our great private shops have responded with wonderful intelligence and professional zeal to the confidence expressed by contrress in irs liberal legislation. We have now at Washington a gun shop, organized and conducted by naval ollicers, that, in its system, economy and product, is unex celled. Experiments with armor plate have been conducted duriuKthe year with most important iesults. It is now be lieved that a plate of higher resisting power than any in use has been found, nnd that the tests have demonstrated that cheaper mothods of manutacturo than those heretofore thought possible can be used. I commend to your favorable considera tion the recommendations of the secretary of the navy, who ha, I am sure, given to them the most conscientious s.udy. There should be no hesitancy in promptly com pleting a navy of the best modern type; lanre enouirh to this country to display its flag in all seas for the prou ctiou of its citizens and of its extending commerce. The world needs no assurance of the peace ful purposes of the United states, but we shall probably be in the future more largelj competitors in the commerce of the world, and it is essential to the dignity of this nation and to that peaceful in fluence which it should exercise on this hemisphere that its navy should be ade quate, both upon theshoresof the Atlantic aud the Pacific. THE IXIHAX TIIOBLEM. The roport of the secretary of the inter ior shows that, very iiratitying progress has been made in all the bureaus which makeup that complex and difficult de partment. The work in the bureau of In dian affairs was perhaps never so lame as now. by reason of the numerous negotia tions which have been proceeding with the tribes for it reduction of the reserva tions, with the incident labor of making allotments, and was never more carefully conducted. The providing of adequate school facilities for Indian children and the locating of adult Indians upon farms involve the solution of the Indian ques-tl-m. Everything else rations, annuities and tribial negotiation with the agents, inspectors and commissioners who dis tribute and conduct them must pass away when the Indian becomes a citizen, secure iu the individual ownership of a farm from which he derives his sub sistence by his own labor, protected by and subordinate to the laws which govern the white man, and provided by the gen eral government or by the local com munities in whiih he lives with the means of educating his children. Wheu au Iu diau becomes a citizen in an organized btat or territory his relation to the general government ceases iu ngu-at measure to be that ot a ward. But the government ought not at once to put upon the state or territory the bur den of the education of her children. It has been my thought that the goerniuent schools and school buildings upon the res ervations would bo absorbed by the school systems of the stares aud territories; but hs it has been found uecesary to protect the Indian against the conipulsa-y niiena tion of his land by exempting it from tx ntion for a period of twenty-five years, would seem to be risht that the general government (certaiuly where there are tribal bonds in its possession) should pay to the school fund of the state what would be equivalent to the local school tax upon the property of the Indian. It will be noticed from the report of tho commissioner of Iudiau affairs that al ready some contracts have been made with district schools for the education of Indian children there is a great advantage, I think, in bringing the Ii.dian children in to mixed schooLs. This process will be gradual, and, in rhemeautime, the present educational provisionsand arrangements the result of the best experience of those who have been charged with this work should be coutiuued. This will enable those religious bodtrs that have under taken the work of the Indiau education with so much zeal and with results so res trainim: and beneficent, to place their in stitutions in new and useful relations to he Indiau aud Ins white neighbors. THK 

SIOCX OUTBKEAK. The outbreak among the Sioux which ocenrred In -December last is, as to the causes and incidents, fnlly reported upon by the war department and the depart ment of the interior. That these Indians had some juatr complaints, especially iu the matter of the reduction of the appro priation for rations and in the delays at tending the enactment of laws to enable the department to perform the engage ments entered into with them, is probably true. But the Sioux tribes are naturally warlike and turbulant and their warriors were excited by their medicine men and chiefs, who preached the coming of the Indian messiah, who was to give them power to destroy their enemies. In view of the alarm that prevailed among the white settlers near the reservation and of the fatal consequences that would have re suited from an Indian incursion. I placed at the disposal of General Milts, com manding the division of the Mis-onri. all such forces as were thought by him to be required, lie is entitled to the credit of liavimr triveu thorough protection to the settlers and of bringing the hoatilesinto subjection with the least possible loss of life. THE CIVILIZED TRIBES. The appropriation of $2,091,450 for the Choctaws aud Chickasaws, contained in the general Indian appropriation bill of March 3, 1891, has not been expended, for the reason that I have not yet approved a release to tho government of the Indian claim ro the lands mentioned. This matter will be made the subject of a special mes sage, placing before congress all the facts which have come to my knowledge. The relations of the live civilized tribes now occupying the Indian Territory to the United States are not, I believe, the best calculated to promote the highest ad vancement of these Indians. That there should be within our borders five indepen dent states, having no relations except those growing out of treaties with the government of the United States, no representation in the nation's legislature, and the people not citizens, is a startling anomaly. It seems to me to be inevitable that tiiere shall be before long some organic changes in the relations of these people to the United States. hat form these changes should take I do not think it desirable now to suggest. even if they were well defined in my own mind. They should ceitainly involve the acceptance of citizenship Jby the Indians and representation in congress. These Indians should have opportunities to pre sent their claims and grievances upon the floor of congress, rather than, as now, in the lobby. If a commission could be ap pointed to visit these tribes to confer with them iu a friendly spirit upon the whole subject, even if no agreement was per fected, the feeling of the tribes upon this question would be developed, and discus sion would prepare the way for changes which must come sooner or later. INDIAN ALLOTMENTS. The good work of reducing the larger Indian reservations by allotments in sev eralty to the Indians and the cession of the remaining lands to the United States for disposition under the homestead law, has been prosecuted during the year with energy and success. In September last I was enabled to open to settlement in the territory of Oklahoma 900,000 acres of laud, all ot which was taken up by settlers in a single day. The rush for these lands was accompanied by a gre.it deal of ex citement, but was happily free from inci dents ot violence. It was a source of great regret that I was not able to open at the same time the surplus lands of the Chey enne and Arapaho reservation, amounting to about 3,000.000 acres, by reason of the insufficiency of the apnropriation for mak ing the allotments. Deserving and impa tient settlers are waiting to occupy these lands, aud I urgently recommend that a special deficiency appropriation bts promptly made of the small amount needed, so that the allotments may be completed and the surplus lands opened in time to permit tne settlers to get upon their homesteads in the early spring. During the past summer the Cherokee commission has completed arrangements with the Wichita, Kickapoo and Tonkawa tribes, whereby, if the agreements ate rat ifiectby congress, over 00,000 additional acres will be opened to settlement, in Ok lahoma. THE CHEROKEE STRIP. The negotiations for the release by the Cherokees of their claim to the Cherokee strip have made no substantial progress, so far as the department is officially ad vised, but it is still hoped that the cession of this large and valuable tract may be se cured. The price which the commission was authorized to offer $1.25 per acre is in my judgment, when all the circum stances as to the title of the lands are con sidered, a fair and adequate one and should have been accepted by the Indians. NEW HOMESTEADS. Since March 4, 1SS9, about 23,000,000 acres have been separated from Indiau reservations and added to the public do main for the use of those who desired to secure free homes under our beneficent laws. It is difficult to estimate the in crease of wealth which will result from the conversion of these vast lauds into farms, bur. it is more difficult to estimate the betterme1 t which will result to the families that have found renewed hope and courage in the ownership ot a home and the assurance of a comfortable sub sistence under free and healthful condi tions. It is also gratifying to be able to leel. as we may, that this work has pro ceeded upon the lines of justice towards the Indian, and that he may now, if he will secure to himself the good influence of a settled habitation, tho fruits of indus try and the security of citizenship. Early in this administration a special effort was begun to briug up the work of the general land office. By faithful work the arrearges have been rapidly reduced. At the end of the last fiscal year only 84,172 final agricultural entries remained undis posed of, and the commissioner reports that with the present force, the work can be fully brought up by the eud of the next fiscal year. 

SPANISH GRANTS. Your attention is called to the difficulty presented by the secretary of the interior as to the administration of the law of March 3, 1S91, establishing a court of private land claims. The small holdings intended to be protected by t'ie law are es timated to be more than fifteen thousand in number. The claimauts are a most deserving class and their titles are sup ported by the strongest equities. The diffi culty grows out of the fact that the lands have largelj' been surveyed according to our methods, while the holdings, many of which have been in the same family for generations, are laid out in narrow strips, a few rods wide, upon a stream, and run niug back to the hills for pasturage and timber. Provision should be made for numbering these tracts as lots and for patenting them by such numbers and without refereuce to section lines. TIIE PENSION BUREAU. The administration of the pension bureau has been characterized during the year by great diligence. The total num ber of pensioners upon the rolls on the ISth day of Juue. 1S31, was 676,160. There were allowed during the fiscal vear ending at that time 250,565 claims. Of this number 102.3S7 were allowed under the law of June 27. 1S90. The issuing of certificates has been proceeding at the rate of about 30,030 per month, about 75 per cent, of these being allowed under ttie new law. The commissioner expresses the opinion that he will be abe to carefully adjudicate and allow b5'J,000 claims during the pressnt fiscal year. The "appropriation for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1SU0 91 was $127 055 793, and the amount expended $lli.53 .649 20. leaving an uuexpetied sur plus of $11155 ls4.64. The commission er is quite confident that there will be no call tins year for a deficiency appropria tion notwithstanding tiie rapidity with which the work is oeing pus'ieiL Tho mistake which has been made by many iu their exaggerated estimates of the cost of pensions "is iu not taking ac count of the diminished value of lirstpay mentsy under the recent legislation. Tnese payments under the geuer.il laws have been for many year very large, as the pension, when allowed, dated from the time of filing the claim, nnd most of thesa claims had lieen pendiug for years. The first payments under the lawot June. 1591, are relatively small, and. as the per cent of tht-se cases diminishes, the annual aggregate ot first payments is largely re duced. The commissioner, under date of Xov. 13, furnishes me with the statement that during the lat four months 113,175 certifi cates were issued 27,893 under the general act of June 27, 1S9D. The average firt pay ment during the four months was $131.85, while the average first payments upon cases allowed during the year ending June 30, 1891 was 239.33, bein.j a reduction in the average first payment during these four months of $107 48. The estimate for pension expenditure for the fiscal year ending June 39, 1893, is $144,951,000, which, after a caretul exam ination of the subject, the commissioner is of the opinion will be sufficient While these disbursements to the disabled sol diers of the great civil war are large, they do not realize the exaggerated estimates of those who oppose this beneficent legis lation. The secretary of the interior shows with great fulness the care that is taken to exclude fraudulent claims and also the gratifying fact thai the persons to whom these pensions are going are men who rendered not slight but substantial war services. THE PACIFIC RAILWAYS. The report of the commissioner of rail roads shows that the debt of the Pacific railroads to the United States was. ou Dec. 31, 1593, $112,512,613 A large part of this debt is now fast approaching maturity, with no adequate provision fot its pay ment. Some policy for dealing with this debt, with a view to its ultimate collec tion, should be at once adopted. It is very difficult well nigh impossible for sb large a body as the congress to conduct the necessary negotiations and investiga tions. I therefore recommend that pro vision be made for the appointment of a commission to agree upon " and report a plan for dealing with this debt. THE CENSUS. The work of the census bureau is now far advanced, and the great bulk of the enormous labor involved completed. It will be a more strictly established exhibit and les encumbered by essays than its immediate prpdecessor. The methods pursued have been fair, careful and intelli gent, and have secured the approval or tne statisticians who have followed! them with a scientific and nonpartisan interest. The appropriations necessary for the early completion nnd publication of the author ized volumes should be given in time to secure the work against delays, which in crease tne cost and at the same time di minish the value of tho work. IRRIGATION. The report of the secretary exhibits, with interesting fullness, the condition of the territories. They have shared with the states the great increase in farm pro ducts and are bringing yearly large areas into cultivation by extending their irri gating canals. This work is being done by individuals or local corporations, aud without that system which a full prelimi nary survey of the water supply" and of the in igable lands would enable them to adopt. The futrue of the territories of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, in their mate rial growth and in the increase, inde pendence and happiness of their people is very largely dependent upon wise and timely legislation, either bv congress or their own legislatures, regulating the dis tribution of the water supply furnished by their streams. If this matter is much longer neglected private corporations will have unrestricted control of one of the elements of life, and the patautees of the arid lands will be tenants at will of the water companies. The United States should part with its ownership of the water sources and the sites for reservoirs, whether to the states and territories, or to individuals or corporations, ouly upon conditions that will insure to the settlers their proper water supplj. on equal and reasonable terms. In the territories this whole subject is under the full control of congress, and iu the states it is practically so as long as the government holds the title to the reservoirs and water sources and can grant them upon such conditions as it chooses to impose. The imprudent granting of franchises of enormous value, without recompense to the state or municipality from which they proceed, aud without, proper protection of tho public interests, is the most noticeable and flagrant evil of modern legislation. This fault should not be committed in dealing with a subject that will before many years affect so vitally thousands of our people. THE MORMONS. The legislation of congress for the re pression of polygamy has, after years of resistance ou the part of the Mormons, at last brought them to the conclusion that resistance is unprofitable and unavailing. The power of congress on this subject should not be surrendered until we have satisfactory evidence that the people of the state to be created would exercise tho exclusive power of the state over this sub ject in the same way. The question is not whether those people now obey the law of congress against polygamy, but, rather, would they make, enforce aud maintain such laws themselves if absolutely free to regulate the subject? We cannot afford to experiment with this subject, for when a state is once constituted the act is final, and any mistake is irretrievable No compact in the enabling act could, in my opinion, be binding or effective. ALASKA. I recommend that provision be made for the organ'Z-tion ot a simple form of town government in Alaska with power to regulate such m titers as are usually in the states under mu-ricipal control. These local civil organizat ions will give better protection in such matters than the present skeleton territorial oiganiz ttion. Proper restrictions as to the power to levy taxes and to create debts should be imposed. THE 

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. If the establishment of t he department of agriculture was regarded by anyone as a mere concession to the uneulightened de maud of a worthy class of people, that im pression has been most effectually removed by the great results already attained. Its home influence has been very great in dis seminating agricultural aud horicultural information; in stimulating and directing a further diversification of crops; iu de tecting and eradicating diseases of domes tic auimals, and, more than all, iu the close and informal contact which it has es tablished aud maintains with the farmers and stock raisers of the whole country. Every request for information has had prompt attention and every suggestion has merited consideration. The scientific corps of the department is of a high order and is pushing its investigations with method aud euthusiasm. INSPECTION REGULATIONS The inspection by this department of cattle and pork products intended for ship ment abroad has been the basis of the suc cess which has attended our efforts to secure the removal of the restrictions maintained by the Euronean governments. For ten years protests and petitions upon this subject from the packers nndstock raiseis of the United States have been directed agaiust those restrictions, which so seriouslv limited our markets and cur tailed the profits of the farm. It is a source of general congratulation that suc cess has at lat been attained; for the effects of au enlarged foreign market for these meats will be felt, uot only by the farm, but in our public finances, and in every branch of trade. It is particularly fortuuate that the increased demand for food products resulting from the removal of the restrictions upon our meats and from the reciprocal trade arrangements to which I have referred, should have come at a time wheu the agricultural surplus is so large Without the help thus derived lower prices would have prevailed. The secretary of agriculture estimates that the restrictions upon the importation of our pork products into Europe lost a market for $20,000,000 worth of these products annually. THE TEAR'S CROPS. The grain crop of this year was the largest in our history 50 per cent, greater than that of last year, and vet the market that has been opened and the larger de mand resulting from shirt crops in Europe has sustained prices to such an extent that the enormous surplus of meats and breadstuff wil! be in irketed at good prices, bringing relief and prosperity to an industry that was much dsprs-ssed". The value of the grain crop of the United States is estimated bv t!t rcretary of agriculture to be this y.-ar $3 OOO.rxio grctter than l.ss year; of meat.- $150.0W. 000. and of all orodncts of the farm $700,000,000 more. It is not inappropriate, I'thiuk. here to suggest that wir satisfac tion .n the conKTOplatlon of .hts marvel ous addition to the national wealth is un clouded by any suspicion of the currency by which it is'measured and in which the farmer is paid for the productof his fields. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. The report of the civil service commis sion should receive the careful attention of the opponents sis well as the frieuds of this reform. The commission iuvites a pTsoiril inspection by senators and repre sentatives of its records and methods, and every fair critic wiil feel that such an ex amination should precede a judgment or condemnation, either of the system or of its administration. It is not claimed that either is perfect, but I believe that the law is being executed with impartiality and that the system is incomparably better aud fairer than that of appointments upou favor. I have during the year extended the classified service, to include superin tendents, teachers, matronsand physicians in the Indian service. This branch of the service is largely related to educational and philauthrophic work, and will ob viously be the better for the chauge. The heads of the several executive de partments have been directed to establish at once an efficiency record as the basis of a comparative rating of the clerks within the classified service, with a view to plac ing promotions therein upon the basis of merit. I am confident that such a record, fairly kept, and open to the inspection of those interested, will powerfully stimulate the work of the departments and will be accepted by all as placing the troublesome matter of promotions upon a just basis. I recommend that the appropriation for the civil service commission be made adequate to the increased work of the next fiscal year. PROTECTION OF RAILWAY EMPLOYES. I have twice before urgently called the attention of congress to the necessity of legislation for the protection of the lives of railroad employes, but nothing has yet been done. During the year ending June 30, 1S90, 369 brakeraen were killed aud 7.S41 maimed while engaged in coupling cars. The total number of railroad employes killed during the year was 2,451 and the number injured. 32.390. This is a cruel and largely a needless sacrifice. The gov ernment is spending nearly one million dollars annually to save the lives of ship wrecked seamen, and every steam vessel is rigidly inspected aud required to adopt the most approved safety appliances. All this is good, but how shall we excuse tho lack of interest and effort in behalf of this army of brave young men, who, in our land commerce, are being sacrificed every year by the continued use of antiquated and dangerous appliances? A law requir ing of every railroad engaged in interstate commerce the equipment each year of a given per cent, of its freight cars with automatic couplers and air brakes would very soon aud very greatly reduce the present fearful death rate amoug railroad employes. 

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS. The method of appointment by the states of electors for president and vice president has recently attracted renewed interest by reason of a departure of the state of Michigan from the method which had become uniform in all the states. Prior to 1832 various methods had been used by the different states, and even by the same state. In some the choice was made by the legislature; in others the elec tors were chosen by districts, but more geuerally by tho voters of the whole state upon a general ticket. The movement towards the adoption of the last named method had an early beginuing and went steadily forward amoug the states, until, in 1832, there remained but a single state (South Carolina) that had not adopted it. That state, until the civil war, continued to chose its electors by vote of the legisla ture; but, after the war, it changed its method and conformed to the practice of the other states. For nearly sixty years all the states save one have appointed their electors by a popular vote upon a general ticket, and for nearly thirty yeara this method was universal. After a full test of other methods, with out importaut division or dissent iu any state, and without any purpose of party advantage, as we must believe, but solely upon the consideration that uniformity was desirable and that a general election in territorial divisions not subject to change was most consistent with the pop ular character of our institutions, best pro served the equality of tho voters and ef fectually removed the choice of president from tile baneful influence of the "gerry mander", the practice of all the states was brought into harmony. That this concur rence should now be broken ia, I think, an unfortuuate and even a threatening episode and one that may well suggest whether the states that still give their ap proval to the old and prevailing method ought not to secure by constitutional amendment a practice which has had tho approval of all. The recent Michigan legislation provides for choosing what are popularly known as the congressional electors for president by congressional districts aud the two sena torial electors by districts created for that purpose. This legislation was. of course, accompanied by a new congressional ap portionment aud the two statutes bring the electoral vote of the state under the influence of the "gerrymander." These gerrymanders for congressional purposes are, in most cases, buttressed by a gerry mander of the legislative districts, thus making it impossible for a majority of the legal voters of the state to correct the ap portionment and equalize the congres sional districts. A minority rule is estab lished that only a political convulsion can overthrow. I have recently been ndvised that in one county of a certain state three districts for the election of members of the legislature are constituted as follows: one has 65,000 population, one 15,000, and one 10,000, while in another county detached non-contiguous sections have been united to make a legislative district. These methods have already found effec tive application to the choice of senators and representath'es in congress, and now an evil start has been made in the direc tion of applying them to the choice by the suites of electors of the president and vice president. If this is accomplished, we shall then have the three great depart ments of the government in tho grasp of the gerrymander the legislative "and executive directly, and the judiciary in directly, through the power of appoint ments. An election implies a body of electors baviug prescribed qualifications, each one of whom has an equal value and influence in determining tne result, So when the constitution provides that "each state shall appoint (elect) in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct a num ber of electors, etc.," an unrestricted nower was uot given to the legislature iu the selection of the methods to lie Used. "A republican form of government" is guaranteed by the constitution to each .state, and the power given by the same instrument to the legislatures of the states to prescrihe methods for the choice hv the state of electors must De exercised under that limitation. The essential features of such a government are the right of the people to choose their own officers, and the nearest practicable equality of value in the suffrages given in determining that choice. It will not be claimed that the power given to the legislature would support a law providing that the persons receiving the lowest vote should be the electors or a law that all electors should be chosen by the voters of a single congressional dis trict. The voters are to choose, and, under the pretense of regulating methods, the legislature can neither vest the right of choice eNewhere nor adopt methods not conformable to republican institutions. It is not my purpose here to discuss the question whether a choice by the legisla ture or by the voters of equal single dis tricts is a choice by the state, but only to recommend such regulation of this matter by constitutional amendment as will se cure uniformity and prevent that dis graceful partisan jugglery to which suca a liberty of choice, if it exists, offers a temptation. Nothing jnst now is more important than to provide every guaranty for the absolutely fair and free choice by au equal suffrage within the respective states of all the officer of the actional government, whether that suffrage is ap plied directly, as iu the choice of member of tne hou-e of representatives, or indirect ly as m the choice of senators and electors l.J.rrsldeBr. rtcspect far public ofScers and obedience to Li w will no cease M be the character istics of our prepie until our elections ctnx tj deciure the will of majorities, fnirly ascertained, without fraud, suppres sion or gerrymander. IX 1 were c-iifed upon to des&ire wherein our chief national danger lies, I should sav, without hesita tion, in the overthrow of majority control by the suppression or perversion of the popular suffrage. That there is a real danger here all must agree. But the energies of those who fear it have been chiefly expended in trying to fix responsi bility udou the opposite party, nther thau in efforts to make such practices impossi ble by either party. Is it not possible to now adjourn that interminable and incon clusive debate, while we take by consent one step iu the direction of reform by eliminating the jerrymander, which has been denounced by all parties as an evil influence In the election of electors of president and members of congress, all the states have, acting freely and separately, de termined that the cnoice of electors by a general ticket is the wisest and safest me hod, and that it would seem that there could be no objection to a constitutional amendment maki..g thnt method perma nent. If a legislature chosen in one year, upon purely local questions, should, pend ing a presidential contest, meet nnd rescind the law for a choice upon a general ticket and provide for the choice of electors by the legislature, and this trick should determiue the result, it is not too much to say that the public peace might be seri ously and widely endangered. I have al luded to the gerrymander as affecting the method of selecting electors of president by congressional districts, but the primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery have relation to the selection of members of the house of representatives. The power of congress Is ample to deal with this thresteaing and intolerable abuse. 

ELECTION FRAUDS. The unfailing testot sincerity in election reform will be found in a willingness to confer as to remedies and to put into force such measures as Trill most effectually preserve the right of the people to free and equal representation. An attempt was made in the last congress to bring to bear the constitutional powers of the gen eral government for the" correction of frauds against the suffrage. It is impor taut to know whether the opposition to such measures is really rested in par ticular features supposed to be objection able or includes any proposition to give to the election laws of the United States adequacy to the correction of grave aud acknowledged evils. I must yet entertain the hope that it is possible to secure a calm and patriotic consideration of such constitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to secure the choice of the officers of the government by the people by fair apportionment and free elections. I believe it would be possible to con stitute a commission, oou-partisan in its membership and composed of patriotic, wise and impartial men, to whom a con sideration of the question of the evils con nected with our election system aud modes might be committed, with a good prospect of securing unanimity in some plan for removing or mitigating those evils. The constitution would permit the selection of the commission to be vested in the supreme court, if that method would give the best guaranty of impar tiality. This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiring into the subject of the law of elections as re lated to the choice of officers of the na tional government, with a view to secur ing to every elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an ap proach to an equality of value in each bal lot cast as is attainable. While the policies of the general govern ment upon the tariff, upon the restoration of our merchant mariue, upon river and harbor improvements, nnd other such matters of grave and general coucern, are liable to be turned this way or that by the results of congressional elections, and administrative policies, some times involv ing issues that tend to.peace or war, to bo turned this way or that by the results of a presidential election, there is a rightful interest in all the states and iu every con gressional district that will not be de ceived or silenced by the audacious pre tense that tho question of the right of any body of legal voters iu any state or in any congressional district to give their suffrages freely upou these general ques tions is a matter only of local concern or control. The demand that the limitations of suffrage shall bo found lu the lawl and only there, is a just demaud, and nb just man should resent or resist it. My aupeal is and must continue to be for a considera tion that shall proceed with candor, calm ness and patience uDon the lines of justice and humanity, not by prejudice and cruelty. CONCLUSION, To the consideration of these very great questions I invite not only the attention of congress but that of all patriotic citizens. We must not entertain the delusion ttiat our people have ceased to regard a free Dallot and equal representation as the price of their allegiance to laws and to civil magistrates. I have been greatly re joiced to notice many evidences of the in creased unification of our people and of a revived national spirit. The vista that now opens to us is wider and more glorious than ever before. Grati tification aud amazement struggle for supremacy as we contemplate the popula tion, wealth and moral strength of our country. A trust, mouieutous in its in fluence upon our people and upou the world, is for a brief time committed to us, and we must not be faithless to its first condition the defense of tho free and equal influence of the people in the choico of public officers and iu control of public affairs.

FATAL FLAMES. A SERIES OF CASUALTIES AT LOUIS VILLE, KENTUCKY. Four Members of a Hook and Ladder Company Crushed to Death by a Falling Wall. A Paotory Fire Eesults in the Daata.of Threa Girls and tha Serious Injury of SaYaral Others- An Engineer Crippled for Life by Being Thrown to the Pavement Tha Chief of tha Department Also Badly Hurt and tha Whole Poroe Badly Demoralized Tha Losses and Insurance, Tha Kilted and Injured. Louisville, Ky., Dec. 9. -A Are brolte out this morning and destroyed the whole sale boot and shoe honsB of Bamberger, Strong & Co.. the establishment of Bliss, Wilson & Co , furnishing goods and notions; Weller, Wolff & Pariie, boots and shoes, Jobuanboeck & Sou. hats and enps. The total loss is S290 000, with insurance of $200,000. Oue fireman is missing and may have been crushed by a falling wall. Later information shows that a number of firemen of a hook aud ladder company were caught under a falling wall of Bam berger. Stroug & Co's. building. Fire Chief Hughes and Captain Weatherford were injured. Four dead firemen are un der the walls and four others are badly hurt. The dead firemen are William More, William Davis, Sam Baker aud Tony Schlicht. At 3 o'clck another fatal fire was raging in F. A. Menne & Co.'s wholesale candy and fancy grocery house, a square above the Boone paper company's building. Tho origiu of the firo is a mvatery. Forty girls were at work wrapping candy on the fourth floor and all wero not able to escape. The fire was out at 11 o'clock aud tho work of taking out the bodies began. Tho bodies of live girls have already beon taken out, burned beyond identification. G. T. Menne, a brother of the senior member of the firm, is supposed to have burned to death, and the firemen think that the bodies of other girls will be found as soon as tho hot embers will permit a thorough search. The fire cut off escape from tho stairway leading from the fourth floor where tho girls were at work. Many jumped from tho windows to a second story projection, and escaped with brok u limbs and bruised bodies. Others got out unhurt. A fire originating in the Boone Paper company's building was supposed to be fully extinguished a little after 8 o'clock last uight, aud later all the engines were withdrawn. The ladder men were the ouly men left. They were watching the adjacent buildings. Four men wero in Bamberger, Strong & Co.'s building nbout twenty minutes before 3 o'clock this morn ing. Laddermen McEvery and George Duff were in the adjoining building of Bliss, Wilson & Co. A terrific explosion was heard, and McEvery and Duff rushed out. They escaped unhurt. McEvery says that the explosion camo from tho building of Bamberger, Strong & Co. Four men were caught by tho crashing walls and timbers and have not since been m With its forcoi weakened by the acci dent of the early moruiug, the Are depart ment was called to the third disaster at the cundy factor?. To add to the casualties and confusion, Major Hughs, chief of the Are department, was so badly hurt in an accident early this morning that he may not recover. While going to tho fire en gine No. 13 rau into the pavement at Twelfth and Broadway, throwing off En gineer Jim Nuttall, hurting his back and probably crippling him for life. Of the forty girls at the candy factory, two escaped at the cost of grievous wounds. Thev were Tberemi Holthaus and Lizzie McGarvey. One of them has a broken leg aud the extent of the injuries of the other could not bj learned up to this time, as she was Immediately taken home in a cab. Some of those wno escap ed did so by leaping from a rear fourth, story window to the rear roof of the etore, tho store being only two stories high in the back. The fire is supposed to have arisen from one of the f urnnccs; which pos sibly exploded. Great confusion exists. Mam street, where the principal whole sale traffic of the citv goes ou, is blockad ed and business is almost at a standstill. The loss on Menue & Co 's building and stock is placed at $72,000, aud the total loss will be nearly three-quarters of a mil lion. The bodies of the girls wero removed ns soou as jiossible to the nearest undertak ing establishment. Two of the girls have been identified as Mary Welsh of 201 Eleventh street, Amelia Dickey and Bar bara Bell. The two not Identified sresup Fosed n be Louisa Kern and Clara Kuusch. n the Mnne wreck is a body suppavtd to be that of Charles Klmmel. a partner of the firm. Iu the Bamberger, Strong & Co. wreck are the bodies of Samuel Baker, Tony Schlicht, William Davis and Tom Moore, all laddermen of Companv No. 1. The injured are Fire Chief Edward Hughes, Liliie Green well, Tracy Ilolbaus, Kate McGarvey, George King and Pjt Shea, a fireman. Locisville, Dec. 9. Gangs of workmen have been searching the ruins of tho fires on Main street nil day idnce tha Annies were subdued and are still bny. At Menne's caudy factory, wLere ten w-re eu tombed by the crashing walls, the only unusual sight from without is a pile of wreckage iu the street. Inside, under the edge of the dripping broken floor and rafters, the laborers are mill Mjarebiiig for the bodies of the missing. I he xni is still smoldering and thw- t no hope for auy.

Notwithstanding tho fact that the organization of both branches ot congress has been perfected and the president has been informed that they are ready to receive his communica tions, it still remains for the managers nt each end of the Capitol to supply tho all important parts ot roe legislative machin ery (the committees) before the wheels can, begin to revolve and the Fif ty-secoad cou gress can begin the discharge of Its proper functions. Already the managers of both branches of congress are struggling with the problem of how to accommodate each aspirant for committee assignments with his personal preference, without causiug discontent, and with due regard to publia policy. In tho senate the only contest likely to be expected is ono relating to a committo of minor importance that on library where at least three senators Messrs. Stockbridge. Dixon and Wdlcott aro anxious to succeed the late chairman, Mr. Evarts. A struggle is possible, however, over the vacancy on too appropriations committee caused by Mr. Farwell's retire ment, inasmuch as a place on this com mittee is of much more importance than ou tho other committees, as it is supremo in the matter of expenditures of public moneys. Beyond the fact that tho com mittee will probably go to one of tho new far western senators, there is no visible determination. Seuator Hoar goes by order and by preference to the head of the judiciary committee, vice Mr. Edmunds, resigned. Air. Teller takes his place as chairman of the committee on privileges nnd election nnd places Mr. Piatt in a position to takn the lead on the patent committee. Thera j, some talk of giving Senator Peffer place on the agricultural comrnlttoa. Some politics is Involved lu thK and iC may be that the Alhanoe senator will o cure a more detdrable place as a rc.-u.lt of the effort of tha Republican And Demo cratic manngers to keop him on their respective sides. Nobody has undertaken, nsyet, to nssigu Senator Kyle, tho South Dakota AllUnoa senator, but the express ed views of Air. Irby, tho South Carolina Alllanco senator, havo caused him to bo assigned to th minority represant-atlon. It is tuld upon good HUtbocity that Speaker OrUp had not up to thU morning offered a fclngle committee chairmanship to any member of the house, and, for that , reason, reports r to hU intentions aro purely speculative and conjecture, based on considerations of geographical location, experlenoe, prominence in special lines of legislation aud adhtrect or non-adherence to tln canvass of tho new Bpoaker, tliouah Mr, Crisp said that ho will nos punish his opponents. His friends, naturally, will not be overlooked. Tbe speaker 1ms to a few friends out lined the policy which will govorn him, no far us individual characteristics aud measures will permit la the make-up of his committees. Ho will, It in learned, endeavor to k1t0 tuo WcSt Rnt north promiuonco lu the membership of tno leading committees, and ovoid, as far as possible, the charge of sectionalism. Tha practical adjournment of thohous6fora weak will glvo him au opportunity to do t great deal of work towards flxloit tho committees before tha Christmas holidays. The com mlttem on rules, enrolled bill, accounU and mlleatre will bo appointed a noon as po!blc The ciutom of recent year has made the chairmen oftwo of tho most important committees thoso oa ways and means and appropriations tho party ossocUtcs of tho speaker on tho rules committee. Mr M11U, it Is expect ed, will be tendered the chairmanship of the ways and means committee on account of hU identification with the tariff reform movement, but personal considerations miy Induce him to decline, and to prefer h placo as simply member of tha commit tee. Ex-Speaker tted and Mr. Burrows are named as the Republican mombora ot the rules committee, it ia almost cer tain that Mr. Springer, n northern man. will be a member of the ways and moans committee, it not chairman. Mr. Holman of Iudiau is tho moit prominently men tioned representative for the chairman ship of the committee on appropriation. Mr. McMillln of Tenneeseo was also sug gested today for that place. Mesira. Hatch and Bland of MUaourl aro slated for the chairmanship of the ogrlcaltUarl and tbe coinage, weight ana measured committees. THE 

TURF. Chicago, Dec. 9. A war of extennina tlon by the authorities has ut last been inaugurated agulnst tho institution knowtt as tbe Garfield park roco traok. Tin place, though ostensibly n a regular Jockey club course, Is, according to the general belief, largely owned by George Hftuklus, who. until the advent here of a city ad ministration opposed to gambllnsc, con ducted oue or the largest gambling bou2 in tbo west. Soon atter being forced tu shnt down his faro dens, the control of tho old West Side track was purchased. From that timo horses have beon colng around in tho rain and now.
