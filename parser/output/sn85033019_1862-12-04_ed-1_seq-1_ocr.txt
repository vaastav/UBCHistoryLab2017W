A little while ago a gentleman of some standing in this county, very plainly and candidly asked us this question : “Why are not you a Democrat?” As the question seemed to have been put in candidness, it deserved a reply, and the reply we made at the time was, that we wer not very certain, but that we were a democrat, but thatfor some years past, we had ceased to act with the Democratic party, not because we detested democratic principles as such, but that in our ideas of things, the so called modern democratic party has wandered away in ma zes —tanglements so wild—so cratic, and of ten, so non-understandable that we could not tell its whereabouts or its principles, if any principles there be in it. Our candid enquir ing friend may know by this the why. We are not sure that the Democratic party every where is exactly of the same type as the strata of the thing that has come within the reach of our notice and wo verily believe that there are honest candid men who hold to the party and act with the party and an honest candid man in any party should be respected, as to ourselves, we do respect such, and although we might differ from such on some questions of policy, still we respect the man if we have confidence in his integrity. But on the other hand, it is not in our nature to harmonize with trick, with dastard knavery, with foul mouth bluster, with political mountibankism, with crafty sniviling, and when we come in contact with any such thing and find it out, we shy it— stand off from it; we dread contagion. If, however, someone was to ask the ques tion, “do j-ou believe in the primary basis of Democratic principles?'’ there is but one answer that wo could in conscience give and that would bo, yea, yea ! and we think that we could in conscience say so without being constrained to follow every fama/.y or clique that may be pleased to call itself dem ocratic: and moreover the democracy of “old llickouv,” and the democracy of “old Buck,” are exceeding diverse in their tecturc, at least in our idea of things they are so. The Jacksonian democracy has always been to our notion, astern fact, a thorough thing, and among the thorough men of modern times in our notion, no man stands higher than pusident JaCKson ;’.but the type of democ racy that now figures and foams, is not the type of the democracy of 1832, when stern old Hickory had the helm ? if it so£wc fail to see it so, alid have failed to sec it so for somo time. Our charactcTcstics, if we have any special ones, are, nut to be draged along, without reflection, at the wheels of any party car; if we take to any party at all it is that party which, in our judgement, is the likeliest to do the thing that is right and fair, and what ever party proves hy its deeds, "Jnot merely by its platforms, but by its actions that it is the host party and docs the bcst*.for_ the Well-being af the whole people, will be most likely to receive what little support we can give it. We u are not yet convinced that the democratic party, as now managed, is the thing; but we are open to conviction. Our mottojs

Paper to PRINT ON. —There is an ex traordinary rise in the price of paper Paper for printing news on is good tip out of all character, and all news papers that intend to continue in being are in creasing their amount of subscription Those at a dollar are going up to sl.s* those at $1.50 to $2.00 and some papers will be suspended as they cannot sustain themselves, the price of material and the price of labor having increased to such a point that their income cannot main tain the expense, we feel it here in this office, and, at present, the very best we can do is to issue half a sheet. There is about *lsodue on subscription, which, if we had in hand would materially help us, but since we have not got it We liafe’ to do the next best way,and the next bbst way is to do as well as we can. We have the County'Comraissioners’ report of the expenses of the poor, and Mr. Knwlton’S opinion of the county property at Mineral Point, in the hands of the com positors. They are both* pretty lengthy epistles, and as we wish to have them co m plete in one issue,- we defer publication un til next week.

By some means our’ daily papers have not come to hand to-day, and vve cannot give the very latest news, and what we have seen or heard of late does not amount to much. The President’s Message is expected and very likely is afloat by this time, though we have not seed it. So far as the move ments of the great armies are concerned, there is nothing exciting in relation to them. We guess that Washington is safe, Rich mond is safe, and, we hope, Dodgeville is safe. [Correspondence from the New York Tribune.] From den. Burnside's Army. Forward —Another Change of Base —■ What the Movement Menus—New Regime—The Change of Command ers. Headquarters of the Army, ) Warren ton, Ya., Nov. 15, ISO 2. J Forward is the word! The order to be in readiness out last night; the order to move was given to-day, and Couch’s corps has been for some hours upon the road. Three weeks ago, when we crossed the Potomac, our advance did not mean much. It was well understood that the then commander did not originate it, that he did not approve of it, that he began it with great reluctance. Again and again I was told by his immediate confidential friends. ‘This movement means nothing. It was undertaken simply to satisfy the public clamor for advance. A winter campaign in this country is impossible. The only way to go to Richmond is by the Peninsula.” This movement is of another sort. Gen. Burnside originates it, and his heart is in it. It means business. It means rapid marching. It means change of base to a more direct, more defensi ble line. With the army in three col umns, led by “Glorious Joe Hooker,” Sumner, bullet-proof old war horse, and Franklin, reputed to possess every sol* dierly quality but industow, it means des perate, decisive fightingrlt means Rich mond. Among division and corps commanders the belief obtains, that under Burnside, there will be no more fruitless, drawn battles. When the clash of arms comes again, it will bring crotfliiflg victory or overwhelming defeat. It will be a day big with the fate of the republic* The weather and the roads are pro pitious. If they continue so for the next thirty days! The inc idents of McClellan withdrawal have already been given you ; and the doad past bury its dead. It was a spec tacle worked up to its utmost dramatic effect. The men were drawn up in line for the last review. The farewell order was read to them. The out-going and in-coming generals, with their long ret inues, rode by ; salutes w T ere fired ; col ors were dipped; officers swung their hats and gave the orders to cheer, and the men cheefed right vigorously. In Franklin’s corps, which w 7 as caught without preparation, they rushed down to the road and did it spontaneously and enthusiastically. But there were whole brigades, mainly of new troops, which stood in stolid sil ence. In spite of the injunction of irre pressible staff officers in the cavalcade to “Give a good one for Little Mac,” they did not send up a single cheer, md* did you notice that Burnside’s old corps (the 9th) was not visited at all, while every other was ? A few days before, Burnside and McClellan chanced to ride through that corps, and an officer who was present assures mo that while threriesw nd cheers for B“nrnside” wert deafening, he did not hear a single voice sliotit “McClellan.” That may explain the neglect. The leave-taking ini many particulars, reminded of another which I witnessed a year ago —the withdrawal of Fremont from his Missouri army. On the whole the exhibition of affection towards Mc was one of which he may justly be proud ; but it fell far sliort of that displayed for Fremont. Still the two cases had sev eral features in common. Both Generals were removed unexpectedly, while their armies were in motion and in the face of an enemy. But there were sharp contrasts as well. Fremont had been tried three months, McClellan seventeen. Fremont stead fastly refused to bid_ adieu to his •rmy, lest the ceremony should profrtttte satisfaction and disorganization, but stole away at daylight. McClellan took his leave with the most impressive and im posing display. Fremont was relieved by an antagonist; but in bis touching Farewell Order to his soldiers hS Said .' “Continue as you have begun, and give to my successor ths same cordial and enthusiastic support with which you have encouraged me.” McClellan was relieved by a warm personal friend, his most highly esteemed lientcriatit; bht in his Farewell Order, modeled in every other respect upon the first, he could not devote a line, or even a word, to the new r commander. McClellan’s principal strength was with the rank and file. He had the affections of the men —notwithoutcxcep- tion, or to any unparalelled extent —but still in general. But so far as I can judge, a vast majority of his brigade, division, and corps commanders are grat ified at his removal. I never heard so severe reflections upon him out of the army as I have in it, day afterday.— Again and again I heard the opinion expressed, by officers of high rank not only that McClellan was disastrously slow and timid, but that the country was dying of McClellan. Personally all hold him in warm regard. In his high office he bore himself mod estly and fitly; and though his removal took away a paralizing incubus, prob ably there is not a single man in the Army of the Potomac who cherishes aught but personal good wishes for its late commander. Wholesale Butchery in Texas.— According to the Texas correspondence of the Tribune, the expedition of Gen. Banks for Texas cannot sail too soon. A wholesale butchery of loyalists is go ing on in Kerr, Kemlel, Kimball, and Gillespie counsies, by order of the rebel authorities. The rebel forces in West ern Texas take no prisoners in these Union counties, but are putting every male inhabitant to the sword, and laying waste the whole country. Such is the terrible report brought to New Orleans by seventy-five Texan refugees who re cently reached that city. Gen. Herbert has proclaimed the four counties named in a state of rebellion against the Confederate States, and his troops are engaged in a work of general carnage and rapine. The condition of the Union people is represented as worse, if possible, than their fellow sufferers for the Union cause in East Tennesse. The Reception of MaonßA. —The Democratic Herald , the new tory organ at Dubuque, published on Sunday last has an extravagant and stilted account of the ovation to the traitor Mahoney, on the return from the old Capitol prison. This account has been copied with great gnstoe by the tory press. The Dubupue Times gives n very different account of the ova tion. It says that the whole thing was a miserable failure. The crowd was about equal to what a second class men ageri would attract; the bonfires con sisted of a few old dry goods boxes; and the entire illumination was embraced in the Herald and Democrat offices, and about four whiskey shops. Some pesky patr’t had spiked the guns and they would not go off. The only audible demon stration during the moving of the pro cession were “three groans for Mahoney,” given with great unction. When the procession reached Mahoney s house, Ben. M. Samuels essayed to make a speech, but found himself “too full for utterance,” as every one knew he would be who saw' him libate at every corner grocery, where he found tallow dips in the window* The crowd dispersed. Ss&When Geu. Sibley was moving from the Lower Agency to South Bend, re cently, with the condemned Indians, the rumor was current at New Ulm, Minn., that the Indians would not be executed, and a serious attack was made upon them with clubs and stones by the women and children of that place. One Indian had his jaw broken, and several others wore severely injured. The women were quite determined in their attack, and the sol diers had considerable trouble in repel ling their assaults cn the savages. The Intfiftns Were chained and comparatively belples?- Headquarters of the Army, Nov. 21. Yesterday the enemy received a sudden cliccfc in their removal of stores by rail from Fredericksburg, our artillery hav ing openfe’d Upon them, disabling a loco motive and detaining tti£ train upon the track near the depot. The rebels how ever continue to remove flour, grain, to bacco, coton &c., by rricans of wagons. Since our evacuating of Fredbmks burge last sptriig, the rebels have ship ed large quantities of grain from the lower river counties Up to that place, and thence refnored it by rail to Rich mond. Last night the enemy built large fires on the hills beyond Fredericksburg, illu minating the whole southern horizon, evidently designing to deceive us with regard to their real force. It is net be lirfted they have a large body of troops in this vicinity, and the impression pre vails that ntf opposition will be made to our occupation of this city. The storm has swollen the streams very much, and rendered the roads al most impassible. A good One. —An amusing little in cident occourred duringthc fight at New tonia, Mo. The fight was a tierce one while it lasted, and one of the officers be came very thirsty. He repaired to a spring in the forest near by to get a drought of cool water, and keeling down, drank from the fountain itself, without the aid of a clip. As Tie arose from the refreshing draught, he sat himself fair and square upon his own heels, which W’ere armed with a tremendous pair of Mexican spurs. The instant he felt the prick of the rowels, he thought the eneinj’ was upon him and a bayonet entering bis flesh. When some of his men arrived he was bawling,“Oh, 1 surrender! I surren der!” The articles of w r ur do not admit of stilting his name. A Man “Expected” to be Loyal. —For the past two weeks the military authorities have been very strict, and as no person is permitted to leave the city who is not loyal, necessarily a vast amount of questioning take place at the Provost Marsnal’s office. A few days ago a tall dejected looking, middle-aged man made his appearance before Col Gillem and solicited a pass. The first question put by the Colonel was ; “Are you a loyal man?” “Well,” said the mysterious looking solicitor, “I expect I am.” “You expect you are ; don’t you know whether you are a good Union man or not?” “I expect; I don’t know, sir.” The appearance of the man and his manner of conversation rather nonplussed Col. Gillhera, who continued, however; “What do you wish to get, sir?” “I want to get home.” “Whore is your home ?” “In East Tennessee ” “When did you arrive in this city ?” “Seven years ago.” “Where was you at the commencment of the rebellion, sir?” “In this city,” “Did you ever hear Andy Ewing make any of his speeches?” “No, sir.” “Have you ever been in the rebel arniv ?” No, sir.” “Do you ever intend to take up anus against the Government of the United States ?” “No, sir.” “Have you a family in East Tennessee, sir?” “Yes, sir—a wife and two daughters.” “How long is it since you have seen your wife ?” “Ten years.” “Ten years! Where have you been during all that time?” “In the State prison, sir.” “Mr. Bent,” said the Colonel, turn ing to one of his clerks, “give this man a pass to East Tcnncsse. —Nashville Letter. in the Free States the pro slavery Democrats have been wonderfully successful at the November elections, the Slave States of Missouri and Delaware were carried by the emancipationists. The Democratic candidates for Governor and Congressmen in Delaware were de feated, and in Missouri a Legislature has been elected that is in favor ef eman cipation. jfcgc-T. C.

An Irish tailor, making a gentle man’s coat and vest too small, was ordered to take them home and let them out.

Coming Down a Peg.— The late King Otho of Greece, was at last accounts looking about Venice for choap boarding house for winf-'T. ... . The Sabbath.— The following general order has been issued respecting the ob servance of the Sabbath day in the army and navy ; Executive Mansion, ) WiSHtNGTON, D. C., Nov. 16. ) The President, commander-in-chief of the army and navy, desires and enjoins the orderly observance of the Sabbath by the officers and men in the military andr navel service. The importance for man and beast of the prescribed weekly reslf the sacred rights of Christian soldiers and sailors; a becoming deference to the best sentiment of a Christian people, and a due regard for the divine will, de mand that Sunday labor in the army and navy be reduced to the measure of strict necessity. The discipline and character of the national forces should not suffer, nor the cause they defend be imperiled by the profanation of the day or the namd of the Most High. At this time of pub lic distress, adopting the worbs of Wash ington in 1776, “Men may find enough to do in the service of God and their country without abandoning themsalves to vice and immorality.” The first genera# order issued by the Father of his Country,- sfter the Declaration of Independence, indicates the spirit in which our institu tions were founded, and should ever be defended. “The general hopes and trusts that every officer and man will endeavor to live and act as becomes a soldier, defending the dearest rights and privileges of his country.” 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Great Britain. The Loudon Times of the Bth ult.; again adverts to the action of the Now York Chamber of Commerce touching the rebel steamer Alabama, and denifear that any blame can be attached to Eng land. It says that her ship-yards aro open to all. England does not fit out ships of war, but sells their component parts to all comers. The London Tiinen then quotes from the message of Presi dent Pierce to Congress in 185C>, to show what America considered her neutrality' and what she was justified in doing an d ring the Russian war. The Times adds ; ‘‘England has never gone beyond, or fully up to the bounds of the American theory, which is perfectly sound, ..ad English neutrals sit as dieiples_ at the feet of President Pierce.” The Daily Nctcs has a very different argument. It says that the government cannot be answerable for every paltry infraction of obligations which its sub jects might be tempted to commit. But looking at the grave charges made against Laird’s ship-building yard on the Mcr* scy, where a navy to be used agains a friendly power is being built, after Eng land has declared her neutrality, is not the government bound either to termi- 1 nate this illegal state of things or to withdraw its neutrality proclamation. The London Times has commenced the publication of “special correspond ence” from Richmond. A letter, dated October 8, in which the writer appears strongly imbued with the spirit of tho secessionists, says : “They suffer terrible desolation, but their spirit of resistance is as high as ever.” The London Daily News furnishes evidence from southern newspapers td show that their military resources are" about exhausted, and that internal dissen sions prevail. John Bright in a letter to Wm. Guf nelle Jewett expresses amazement at the idea of concilation toward the South re garding slavery. He says : “The North may from the South or fight out the contest and win, but to leave the slave still a slave will expose her ttf the contempt of the civilized world.” He adds : “I applaud the Proclamation of President Lincoln as docs every man in Europe who is not a foe to freedom” or moved by base hostility to the Amer ican repuulic, because it is a republio and a powerful one. At a crowded meeting of the Metrop olitan Institution of London resolutions expressing sympathy with the North, were adopted. Lord John Brougham, in a letter, ex presses a strong hope that the govern ment will refrain from interfering ill case of a servile insurrection in the South-' ern States. It was rumored that Lord Elgin had retired from the governship of India oW-' ing to the climate not agreeing with him.; and the Duke Afgyls would him. The great exhibition closed without any formal ceremonies. The attendance and total receipts both exceed the great Exhibition of 1851. Parliament has been further prom* gued until the 13th of January. The continental political news is im portant. Arrangements have just been per fected by the tiov’nmentw hereby the su'ftf of nearly half a million dollars of the small currency notes will be printed and issued weekly. This, it is hoped, will afford a satisfatory supply for a few weeks at least, when the issue may be still fur-*, ther increased. NO. 12.
