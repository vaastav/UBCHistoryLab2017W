Bell Adami> in the chair and Prof. A. M. llreen secretary pro tent. Mr. Adams stated that the meeting was calle 1 lor the purpose of reorganizing the Boys in blue, which organisation w.u, Tor the purpose ol' aiding the Republican party, lie then recited at length his version of the difficulties which have ulVlded the B.'s In B., which, he said, resulted from the new Kxecutive Board chosen la.-t June, having called on the Commander-inChief (A. Giant) for an official account of his stewards-hip. L'i> to that time no objection ha I been made as to the legality at the board,but they had the audacity to a?k him for an account in 1 tin 11 the <iue*tioii wa.< raised that the Board not legal. He proceeded to argu.' at length th?; legality of the Board, and his(A.'s) claim to the command. Mr. E. S. Atkinson found men, who were "^reheads, wlio condemned l?otli A. tlra'it and J. Bell Adam*. He believed that the organization kaU itM wark, ami wm mmw. ivti miriH iv luv ['?? ij# i nc vi^auiftniiuu ? n:ated and he referred to the fact that tin lruiuiuint: ami lilting ol Uie Bovf in Blue ha<? done much harm, and ,th.it children were keeping t>ad honrs an 1 getting into misliicf because of it. lie was lor discontinuing the organization to-night, and did not tiling that the Grant faction would last longer. He, lher? ti re, moved that the meeting proceed to tirpanize a central workinf*iu?"n*s association. The Chair declined to entertain the motion. Mr. Perry Carson gave a sketch of hi* connection with the Itovs in Blue, and said he was i>1 -posed to any more parading with cape* and torches*. He was ashamed of the Boys in Blue rm Inauguration day. and moved that they proceed to organize a military compaHv. Mr. Huul>er thought they should, a-* the old organization had l>een a failure, organize as militjkrv, and he did not wish in future to see men with iVcent cape* and 10-cent caps. Mr. ISoliert Thomjison, after stating bin o<Hinection with the Boys in Blue first an an officer ami then a* a member of the board, said he had stood by when A. Grant was sounding the death knell of the party, aud he thought that lie was attempting the 'defeat tbe party ot w hich he claim.-d to f>e a meml?er, and even refund to register. When Grant was imi?eached he made charges against Adams ami among other* selected to try the latter was "poor little SlovA-n." [Laughter.] Cajt. Kurtz, after speaking of the course of Tom Swann in Maryland, urged the imiortance of organising military companies here. Mr. Atkinson sj?ok*e of A. Grant as another Tom Swann. He was now buying i>oor men in the Fifth Ward. He referred to men in that ward starving, and yet buying capes and caps. They i-hould organize a workingmen's organization. and go to Congress and ask an appropriation for the avenues, so that thev can get work, and they will not need soup. Ask for work and not soup. [Applause-] He could *|>eak for the people of the V ifthWard that they were tired of the Boys in Blue. Mr. Chas. A. Peters gave his experience as an officer or the organization, in which he had heard A. Grant vontiiiK his spleen against the Republican party. That organization had proved a failure, and he emk>rsed the views of M r. Atkim-on as to a workingmen's organizatlAII MWII. A vote on Mr. Atkinson'* motion to organize a Central Workingmen's Association was nearly a tie. A division was called for, .when Mr. 1'ulfey raised the point that no such motion could l>e entertained, and it was not proper th:?t any outsiders should come here to spring such a <|?" stion, and If he wished to carry ?uch a question he should call a meeting for the purI*>se. The <hair sustained this point. Mr. Collins Cruso defended the Boys in Blue as a great auxiliary to the Kepubliaan pa-ty. He Old not want the whole organization blamed for Grant's sins, f A voice?"He's erttln* reailv to be elected Alderman of the Fifth \Card. ] Uraiit would be broken up and by next June lib nsine would not be mentioned.

The members of the Board had decided to make the organisation a military one and go to Congress for authority to organize the militia of the District of Columbia, but they will know who they enlist. Mr. K. Thompson moved that the meeting proceed to place the organization on a military Mr. A. M.

Mr. Aaron U. Pocrll. filitar of th# Aati siavry .Standiril, N. V., submitted a paper lietailing the condition of the laboring people in bin State. He contented that what was needed there most was the power behind the throne? the elective franchise?and recommended the Convention to appeal to Congress to (five the poor laboi ing classes of the South lands belonging to the Government fur their use, as it had fuileil to enact laws to confiscate the rebel lands for this purpose.

Ertning fritivn?The Convention reassembled at 7 o'clock. Afr. P. w 0f ^ic District of Columbia, offered the following, which was adopted: That the Hon. B. J. B..wen. Mayor of Washington, has, in acknowledging the rights of labor thr>igbout the country indisci-iminat"ly, kindly extended municipal welcome t?this convention in a most eloquent address: therefore Krtolrt'l, That a committee.consisting of the President and \ ice ('resident of this convention.be appointed to wait npon the Mayor and acknowledge their appreciation and esteem of him who has so nobly expouced the cause of humanity and equality throughout this country. Senator Sumner, who was expected to address the Convention, having sent his excuses for not appearing? Hon. J. II. Kaincy, of S.

He regretted that the comae pursued here is not of that character that his constituency bail expected; that he would not be able to return Lome and tell them then of some system which liad been devised by this Convention whereby some of their wants would be satisfied. They are <te*irons of knowing from the acts of tliis Convention what can be done to give them justice; they wanted land, so that they would not be obliged to build up another southern aristocracy. He hoped this Convention would not break' up until some plan was devised whereby they could obtain justice, and som<? action taken" that would compcl Congress to take notice of the subject. Bishop Campbell, of N. J., was introduced, and said he confessed and plead guilty to the fact that he belonged to that class of men called preachers; had been one al?ont thirty years, even when slavery held sway all over the South, and when even in the North it was dangerous to agitate the subject.
