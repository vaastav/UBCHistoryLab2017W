ALEXANDRIA, YL. TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 2. With the exception of bis recommenda f.on of a canal and railroad across Nicar ? lerritory, and that for a compromise of ?he debts of the Pacific railroads, President Arthur's last annual massage is an cxeellen State paper. Bat it is so in a negate rather than a positive way, and consequent w shows that a very ordinary man may make a very good Preset. Notas.ng one of his suggestions >3 new, ""t lerrns sov of them are eveo expressed in term* different from those in which they had pre viously become familiar to the public. In his last, as i. his Dr,t message, be makes M mention of ill- 5-outb, g noring her therein ascompleeb as he has done in the composition of his Cabi net But she has not repined at the lattei, aud is thankful for the former, as she can, by a strain of her desire for a reunited coun try attribute the omission to a correspond ing' desire on his part. Indeed this last message is so good in itself, and can be mai.e so much better by liberal construction that it goes far to condone many of the Presi dent's previous sins of commission as well as of omission, and were knot for bis ne farious bargain with Mahone he could retire to the obscurity from which ho accidentally emerged with a forgiven if not a fair record. But that one ai t will blemish his name for ever. Like the stain of blood it will not out, and would have been an ineffaceable blot even upon a saint's reputation. With a republic?n Secretary ot the I r? a eury recommendim: a reduction ol thetardl, and a republican President endorsing that recommendation, it begins to look as if the republican party, as long anticipated, in tends to come over to the democratic idea and adopt a low tariff policy, and thus leave the protective tariff to the support of that small and anomalous class of politicians known as democrat ic protectionists. That the republican* of the Northwest are withdrawing their support of a protective, and giving it to a reform tariff is rendered apparent by the immense republican looses there at the late election. The Northwest is now a great agricultural country, and the farmers there are wise enough to know that protection doesn't protect, them. Thk New York Herald'* opposition to Mr. Blaine has had the gratifying tffect of opening its eyes to the corrcct condition ot political affairs in the South, and it now sees, as plainly as a Southern man doe3, that the only political bulldozing in the South is that practiced by the negroes upon tbo.se of their own race who may want to vote the democratic ticket. It now a- knowledge the fact, and cites instances to prove it, that Southern negroes "make it hot' for such of their own race who vote with their white neighbors and employers. It is hoped that the President's recom mendation of the suspension of the coinage of silver dollars may be adopted. 1 hat coin is an ugly and unwieldly one; the worst with which the country was ever indicted. It is so unattractive that the people refuse to accept it, and it consequently tills up aud overflows all the room in the Treasury vaults. No more should bo issued, and what has already been minted should be recoined aud made to contain its par value of silver. Thk Pit 

ESIDKNT is so much of a free trader that he not only recommends free trade treaties with all the commercial na tions of the world, but even goes so far as to advise that American registers be given to foreign built ships. Thk Norfolk Laiulmark&iys that a uogro, un der the influence of the fear instilled into him by the federal ollicer holders that ho would be re manded to *lavery, told his employer that he would have to leave him aud go to Catada, aud that thereupon the employer snid, "Very well, if slavery-is to be rc-03tabli3hcd lot me kuow, aud I'll go with you, for I'm not going to support the gang of idle negroes my father had hanging on him all hii lifetime." And that's just the way every Southeru mau feels, though many of tliein don't take the trouble to say so.

I Washington. D. C., Dec. 2.1884. Mr. Goss, of the Potomac Manufacturing Works, of Alexandria, arrived here to day from Maine. He say*, in reference to the works referred to, that the proprietors thereof are more disappointed at their pro longed idleness than the people of Alexan dria can possibly he, but that as they can Deither create a demand for ships or for iion there is no use nor sense in making either. He says the preseut proprietors had a great deal of trouble ic gettiug the works out of debt and in a condition to com mence unobstructed operations, but that just as that difficult work had been accomplish ed the prevailing business depression came on and that that necessitated the existing delay. He says the company has no idea of of abandoning the works, hut that on the contrary they are only waiting for the re vival of bnsiufss to start them and to give employment to a large nnmber of hands The House River aud Harbor Committee met this morning aud agreed to prepare a liver and harl*>r bill upon the basis of last year's bill, but to restrict the appropriation if possible within tbelimitsof eigbtmillions, aud also that they would refuse to hear any j delegations that might come to them urging ! appiopriations for particular improvements, j , The friends of the Educational bill in the | House will hold a conference to-morrow or i next day in reference to that bill, and to try ' to devise some way by which the objection- i able features, as passed by the Senate, can be removed, so that it can be passed at this session of Congress,and the money to be ap propriated by it made available for the pub lic schools in all the States next year. Mr. Morrison said to-day that if the House evinced a disposition to reduce the existing tariff a bill for that purpose would be in troduced, but not otherwise, as there would be no time to waste in a prolonged fight over such a bill. Mr. Randall, who has just returned from a visit to Georgia, was delighted with his trip, and speaks in the highest terms of the social aud hospitable character of the South ern people. He says he always thought the people of the fc'outh were good people, and that now he knows it. 'To show how deeply interested the na tional legislators are in the affairs of the country, several of them who were asked this morning what they thought of the Presi dent's message, said they had not heard it read yesterday aud had not bad time since to read it. All the democrats who bad either heard or read it spoke of it in favor able terms, but some of the republicans did not, for the reason that it leaned too much toward free trade. The democrats are much pleased with Sec retary McCulloch's message on account ol its low tariff recommendations, but some of the republicans deuouuee it seveiely on that very account, and even go to tar as to s-ay Mr. McCulJoch is a democrat, was Secretary under one democratic President, aud is now playiig his cards so as to hold t.hn nositiou under another. It. the'Bouse Mr. Follett, democratic member from Cincinnati, introduced a reso lution for investigating and impeaching L< t Wlight, U. S. marshal for Ohio, for ti e illegal 'and partisau manner in which he conducted his otlice at the last election. Mr Keifcr, who has the brass of a castle door, opposed the passage of the resolution in a weak, spluttering and lubberly speech, in which he accused tbe democrat* ol Cin uinimti of arresting and imprisoning hun (ir -ds of negroes iu Cincinnati to prevent them from voting. Mr. Post, member of the House from Pennsylvania, and secretary of the demo cratic Congressional campaign committee, savs the ??ivil service laws do not in the remote*: degree restrict the President's power * f removal from otlice, but that on !he contiaiv they compel him to remove lhe federal ollicelulds in the Soutb, almost every one '-'I whoio, he understands, has made his otlice. a part of his party's machine. Mr Logan has had his hair cut, and mourns for himself if nobody else mourus for him. Ho thiuks that if Blaine and his managers had possessed ordinary gumption ihey could have so arranged matters with Coiikling's friends that the republican loss in Conk ling's county would not have taken place, and that he, therefore, would not have Ween defeated. He thiuks he has been badly treated by republicans, and also that Blaine's late speech was improper and en tirely uncalled for. A Virginia republican here to-day speaks in the most abandoned way of his party, which, he s?ys, Ma hone has "busted." He says he heals i bat Major S. P. Bayly, a well known r< publican of bis .State, says the child isu t borne that, will see the democrats go out of power, and that he is very much of the Ma jor' * way of thinking. Geueral Mahone was not in his seat in the Senate again to day, and it is said will not. arrive until next week. Neither had Mr. lviddleberger put in his first appearance . up to two o'clock to day. A member of the Virginia Legislature here to day says that Geu. Mahoue's organ in Richmond says that it hopes if the mem bers of that body eve* meet again it will be in a place whose existence is denied by Mr. Robert Ingersoll. He also f-ays that Mahone threaens *o carry the new election law of that State to the courts; but that if he shall do so, and the courts sustain him, Auolhcr member of the Legislature says that body will reassemble immediately aud con tinue in sessiou uutil the last Mahone offi cial.judges aud all,shall have been removed. In the Senate to-day Mr. Vest introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the leases of lands in the Indian Territory. In a few remarks thereon he said that though such leases were illegal the Secreta ry of the luterior said he would defend those which had been made. Mr. Ve9t said that the leases were for millions of acres, and wete obtained by bribery and corruption. Mr. Couger objected to the consideration of the resolution, but allowed Mr. Dawes to speak, and that gentleman, contrary to his expectations, rather sustain ed Mr. Vest. Mr. Geddes, democratic member of the House from Ohio, says bis idea is that each of the States ot New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Indiana will have a Cabi net member, that the South will have two, that that will 611 six of the seven places, and that if the other one comes to bis State, and falls to the lot of Mr. Tburmau all will be happy and the goose will hang high. Mr. Gorman t-ays that President Cleveland will rosipu his position as Governor of Now York ou the t>th of JanuHry. Ho also says that tlio ru mors to tin* effect that certain gentlemen bad been offered Cabinet positions wore without the slight est foundation, that nobody had yet beeu offered such a place, and that it was doubtful even if any body bad been determined upou yet to whom such a place would bo offered. Brains Will Tell.?Persons who p o pose to cultivate President-elect Cleveland's acquaintance through the medium of "small tokens of their esteem" should carefully read the following letter: Executive Mansion, ) Albany, N. Y., Nov. 27,18S4. J My Dear Sir?Day before yesterday, when I arrived here iu the evening from the Executive Chamber, I found in the house a line Newfoundland dog, and yesterday' I learned through your letter that the dog was intended as a gift from you. 1 hope you will not deem it affectation on my part when I write you that I am very adverse to receipts of gifts, especially in the relation ot strangers, which you and I sustain to each other. A number of small gifts have been sent to me, some of them, doubtless, from those who seek in this manner to show their good will, while others have been received from those whom I suspect of attempting purely to procure an acknowledgment. It is hard to otrend the former class by an ex hibition of churlishne-?3 or lack of apprecia tion, aud my disposition is to humor the de sire of the others. The acceptance of pres ents of value which could involve an obli gation I should deem in my present position eutirely inadmissible, and I confess I should feel better if all gifts of every description j were discontinued. I have determined to assure you most heartily of my full appreci ation of your kinduess in sending me the dog, and I hat I do not at all mistrust your motive in doing so, and while thaukingyou for the friendliness which prompted the gift I ask you to permit me to return the snme. I sh.ili please myself and hope not otfeud you by sending the dog by express to your address to morrow, at my expense. Yours, very truly, Grover Cleveland. To William J. Loader, esq , No 215 Dean street, Brooklyn. THE 

LEGISLATURE. j The Legislature adjourned yesterday sine j lie. Governor Cameron refused to sign the bill authorizing the Auditor and Treasurer to make a settlement with the Petersburg Planters & Mechanics' bank in the matter of the of the State's deposits in that bauk. He says in bis message: "lu my judg ment the most stringent reasous exist for not establishing approval of auy such mea sure. The bill states no reason why relief should be afforded to persons who deliberate ly eutered into bond and security to guaran tee the Commonwealth against Joss for tbe deposits of the State's money made from time to time in the Planters and Mechanics' Bauk of Petersburg, Virginia. Nor does the bill set forth any public reasons why a compro mise should be permitted to those ou whom rest the full obligation of, if responsibility for, any deficiency in payment by the Plant ers and Mechanics' Bank of its obligation to the Treasury of the Commonwealth. Of the sureties for the bank referred to under House bill No. 162 at least live (including the president and vice-president ol the iu s itution) were directors in the same. These pt-rsous occupied, then, the double relatiou of sureties to the State lor the public de posit and of guarantors that the business of the bauk should be pioperly and honestly conducted. No doubt existed at tbe time of the several deposits on my mind nor on tbatofauy well informed business man In the Slate tbar the property of the signers of the boud was more than ample to cover tin deposit. It- will notdo, now, for the sureties, who filled as well the relation of directors, to hrk immunity on the plea that the funds of ill* bank have been improperly used; for, if so, who can be responsible buttbe president, vice president, and other members of the board of directors? And when the func tions of bondsmen and directors unite in the same persons it does seem to me this is not one in w hich the Commonwealth should propose a compromise. The allegation is made that these persons (who can he proved to have been solvent for the amounts of multiplication at the time tbe bond w-as tiv?n)have sold, transferred, or otherwise concealed the assets ou which they were considered to be sufficient as sureties. So much the worse for them ; if so, that charge, if e.-tablished, would emvict them not ol neglect alone, not of criminal carelessness only, but of au attempt to avoid a responsi bility voluntarily assumed, exigent morally and in my judgment tqunlly binding. The elfe t of this proposed bill (it it has any ellect) will not be that which some advo a es of it have said ; on the contrary it will tic to punish all depositor*, including tbe St.aU*, and to h ave the immunity of ill-doing to these whose failure in promise and per form a nee has caused the need of loss to anj one. And if the policy proposed in Hou-e bill No. 1G2 is to be followed hereafter, or sustain uow, such policy will be open notice to every surety for a bank of deposit that the State's money can be taken without re course to the Commonwealth." The Governor also refused to sign the following bills: To provide compensation for the Senate when sitting as a court of impeachment during the recess of the General Assembly and the expenses incident thereto; to re peal an act entitled an act authorizing a review by the county court of the decisions of justices of the peace in cases of misde meanor; to authorize the Rockbridge Ar tillery Company, acd Dauville Greys, of the city of Danville, to adopt uniforms for their members; to prohibit the hoard of supervi sors of each of the counties bordering on the bays, livers, and creeks in which oys ters are planted from imposing a levy on such oysters for county purposes, to remove the restrictions against catching oysters with tongs in certain waters of the Chesa peake, and to prevent a double lax on oys ters transported to market on steam-vessels; and authorizing the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund to employ counsel in certain cases. _ The Troubles in the Auditor's Office. The irregularities in the office of the Au ditor of Public Accounts developed by the report of tbe legislative committee on Sat urday, has creatcd quite a sensation. The loss the State will sustain canuot as yet be estimated. Developments show that some of the court clerks, whose accounts on the Auditor's books showed them delinquents, communicated the fact that they held re ceipts from Mr. Smith, lirst clerk of that of Gee, fOr amounts charged against them. Tbe grand jury of the Hustings Court of Richmond yesterday commenced au inves tigation of tho affair. This will no doubt result in bringing to light the whole system by which the irregulnrities in tbe office occurred. Some of the discrepancies which have been discovered *hy the par tial investigation of the legislative committee are traceable beyord the period at which the administralion of the office passed into the hands of the Mahoneites. .Mr. Smith, tbe first clerk in the Auditor's office, whose duty it was to audit and at tend to the class of accounts in which the irregularities have occurred, yesterday made a deed conveying all of his property iu trust for the benefit of Auditor Ma rye. This consists of land in West Virginia, and fur niture, bric-a-brac and other personal estate roughly estimated at $20,000. In event any loss is proved to have been sustained by the Commonwealth through Smith's couduct this is to be sold to meet the same. His connectiou with the office was yesterday formally severed. Mr. Smith's numerous friends are perfectly coufident that a tho rough investigation will fully acquit him of an}' sort of criminality in the mat ter. Tbe following is the deed made by Mr. Smith which was admitted to record yes terday : This deed, made this 20th day of November, in the year 38S1, between William R. Smith, of the city of Richmond, State of Virginia, of the first part; A. K. Aleocke, now residing in sai l city, of the second part, and Morton Marye, of the third 1 art? Whereas the said William R. Smith has been clerk in the office of said Morton Marye, Auditor of Public Accounts of tbe State of Virginia, since about the second day of January, 38S-1, and the said William R. Smith is willing to secure the said Morton Marye against all loss by the acts and doings of the said William Smith since he has been clerk aforesaid ; now, therefore, this deed witnesseth that the said William R. Smith, in cousidoration of the premises and of one dollar to bim paid before the signing and scaling of this deed, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, doth grant unto the said A. R. Aleocke, with gen eral warrantry, all the books, pictures, mantel ornaments and household furniture of him the said Smith, including one piauo-forte. now in "the hoiue of Mrs. M. F. Spotswood, on Franklin street, between Seventh and Eighth streets, Richmond, Va., in which house the said Smith also resides a.j a boarder. Also two tracts of land situate in Calhoun county, W. Va., owned by the said Smith, for a more particular descrip tion of which land reference is made to the deeds conveying the same to him, now on record in said Calhoun courty. In trust to secure and save harmless the said Morton Marye from all loss, ^wing to tho condoct, acts, and doings of the said Smith as clerk as aforesaid,should the said Mayre sutler anv loss by occasion of the acts and doings >f tho said Smith, then the said Alcocke will sell Lite said pr ip^rty, and from the proceeds of said >ale reimburse the said Marye the said los?, and j .lie remainder of the proceeds of said sale be will | jty over to the said Smith after paying c ists of | inle and reserving a commission ot f? per centum | 'or his services in this behdf. Bui. should the j laid Marye suffer no sach loss, then the said ' Alcocko will recouvey the said property to the said Smith. Witnoss the following signature aud seal. William E. baiiTH, [Seal].

In addition to the outline of the Presi dent's message given in the Gazette's Washington correspondence yesterday even ing we append the following synopsis: He alludes to the recent presidential elec tiuu and congratulates the country upon the fact that, despite the fervor and intensi ty of the contest and "the slight preponder ance by which the issue was determined the public peace suffered no disturbance. In this be sees a signal demonstration of '?the strenuib and wisdom of our political institutions," yet iu view of the controversy over the uational election eight years ago, and the evident risk of dispute over the re cent contest by reason of the narrowness oi the margin by which it was decided he a-ain calls the attention of Congress to the u cessitv of providing more precise and definite "regulations for counting the electo ral vole. Our foreign relations continue to h?, wholly amicable. With Nicaragua a treatv has been concluded by which the United States seeu e ce:t in advantages f. r : ut* cuusuuetiou of an interoceanic canal, a raiiwav and telegraph Hue through the ter ritory "of that republic. With Spain "has been negotiated a reciprocity treaty, the re sult of which would, it is thought be to u-ake ihe intercourse between Cuba and Porto Kico and ourselves scarcely less inti mate than tlie commercial movement be tween our domestic ports." The treatj of similar character with Mexico has beeu t-jiilied, and but awaits the necessary tantl .-t:islation of Congress to become effective. ftie<e treaties are the expression of a set tied policy on the part of the goyernment to cultivate, through reciprocal concessions, intimate trade relations with all the couu nies of this hemisphere, and the mission of the Central aud South American commis si. in which is about to proceed to Mexico is 10 prepare the way for a general "enlarge ment of ou?- commercial intercourse with American States." The neutrality laws of 11n? United States, it is recommended, should in: enlarged "to cover all patent acts of hos lility committed iu our territory and aimed :u:iiMist the peace of a friendly nation. I he President, sees no reason why "overt nn parationa in this country for the com mission of criminal acts should not be pun ishable, whether such acts are intended mi be committed hero or abroad." Some m? diluation of our naturalization laws .s ;,|M> r? quired. 'Jhe recommendations ,.f the Secretary of the 'Ireasury, are ivmunvd in with some explicitness. I'lie coinage of silver dollars nnd the I-nil ice of silver certificates should i?. immediately suspended, experience ? living shown it to be impossible to get the i.i me'r into circulation, while the growing I ?l.uiidum e of the latter threatens to drive ? old < ut of circulation, thus etl'ectiug a seri 0 us on traction of the currency and creat :-.,r the conditions of a financial panic. Uti le.'.-* this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be suspended, silver is likely at distant day to become our sole metallic tatdard." To speed the retirement ofihe rntle dollar it is suggested that "a slight ?idvance over their bullion value" might be ollerc d for them. The beautification of our subsidiary silver coin and an increase ol .heir weight is thought to be advisable, rho recommendation thiit nil internal rev rune taxes except those on distilled spirits 1?. abolished is renewed. The revenue thus lost will cut down the present surplus, but si ill leave a margin "large enough to per mit such taiiff reduction as may seem to be advisable when the results of recent reve nue laws and commercial treaties shall have -howi. in what quarters those reductions cun be most judiciously effected. ine Secretary of the Treasury's advice that a commission bo creatcd to study the prob lem of "increasing our foreign trade and thus relieving tho depression under which our industries are now languishing" is con curred iu. Special attention is invited to t he Secretary's recommendation of subsidies ?e* the be^t means of building up our mer chant mm inc. The rapid redemption of the per cei.t binds threatens the destruction 01 the basis on which the national bauks can pre fit ably rest their circulation, and the question how to avert the contraction of currency caused by this threatened re tirement of na'ional bank notes, is recog nized as one of constantly increasing im portance, aud the hope is expressed that, us a temporary expedient at least, the banks be allowed to issue notes to the lull par value of the bonds deposited by them with the treasurer. A considerable reduction iu the expenditures of the War Depart ment is noted. A notable feature ol the past year has been the entire absence of In dian outbreaks. The defenceless condition of the important cities oi the seaboard, us demonstrated by the chief engineer's report , is discussed at some length. rlhe time has now come, in the President's opinion, when defensive works may be begun with some confidence tbat they will not be rendered useless before their completion by the pro gress made abroad in the improvement of guns. "For the most important cities, those whose destruction or capture would lie a uational humiliation, adequate de fence?, inclusive of guns, may be made by the gradual expenditure of SG0,tX)0,00U. much less than a victorious enemy cou d levy as a contribution. An appropriation of about one-tenth of that amonut is asked to begin the work." One of the four steel cruisers authorized by the acts of 1SS2 and lSSo is described as more than half finished, and "certain adverse criticisms upon the designs of these cruisers" are mentioned as discredited by the favorable opinion of these vessels held by the naval authorities. The restoration of the navy to its former effi ciency is warmly urged.
