For some months past the people of the United States hare been flatter ing themselves with the belief that that worn out bugbear, the Alabama question, was at last laid happily at rept, and that nothing remained to do except to settle in an amicable manner the amount of damages to be paid by the British government for the depre dations committed on American commerce by English-built privateers during the war of our Southern rebellion. It now appears to have been discovered by onr Washington wiseacres that the British representatives on the Joint High Commission have out-Yanlceed the Yankee nation; that they have in every way got the better of us in the construction of the Board of Arbitrators created under the Treaty of Washington, and that a decision adverse to the position and interests of the United States will assuredly be the result of the Geneva Conference. The grounds upon which these conclusions are based are stated by our correspondent to be the astound ing revelations, first, that only two of the five arbitrators are friends of a republican form of government; secondly, that two of tbem be long to the "fallen and degenerate Latin raoe," and, thirdly, that Lord Chief Jus tice Cockburn, the representative of Eng land in the Conference, cannot be sup posed to be friendly to the interests of the United States in the matter, influenced as he will be by the views of his own govern ment To be sure it may oocur to some per sons not so profound as your Washington poli tician that as the Conference is composed of five members, three of whom are the repre sentatives of monarchies?the kingdom of England, the kingdom of Italy and the empire of Brazil?there is nothing so very startling after all in the disobvery that only the re maining two?the representatives of Switzer land and the United States?are advocates of a republican form of government. That two of the arbitrators are of the Latin race may be a fearful fact to contemplate; but what will our exoited Congressmen say when they discover that a third member of the Con ference, the Lord Chief Justice of England, is himself on his mother's side, descended from that "fallen and degenerate" stock? Although we may be willing to set off the presumed hos tility of Charles Francis Adams, the American representative in the Conference, to the Eng lish view of the Alabama question, against the supposed hostilities of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn, the Eaglish representative, to the American view, we cannot forgive the British portion of the Joint High Commission for hoodwinking us into the folly of entrusting to a majority of the Latin race the decision of a controversy which has hitherto been all Greek to most of our people, and especially for foist ing on to the Conference thiB same Lord Chief Justice, the son of a St. Domingo French woman, thus cunningly beading off President Grant in his' favorite St. Domingo policy. The upshot of all this, we are told, is to be the failure of the whole business of the Joint Iligh Commission, and of its offspring, the Geneva Conference, and the re-opening of the Alabama dispute with redoubled bitterness. This is not the whole, or the most wonderful portion, of our Washington story. The Spanish government 1b found to be at the bottom of these new complications, and, by some mys terious application of "logio peculiar to Wash ington, Spain is supposed to favor England's non-liability for the escape of the Ala bama, because she desires to hold the United States responsible for the escape of Cuban privateers and for the protection given to the Hornet and the Flor ida. Armed with these facts, the gallant Banks, of Massachusetts, on the one side, and, Sunset Cox, of New York, on the other side, are to lead off in the House of Representatives to-day in a terrific crusade against President Grant and Secretary Fish when the question of the appropriation of a quarter of a million of dollars for the expenses of the Geneva Conference comes np In Committee of the Whole. Herein, we imagine, lies the secret of all these startling revelations; for we are assured by our Washington correspond ent that the administration is cer tain to be crushed to powder be tween the upper and nether millstones of Cox and Banks. The recent Presidential im peachment programme of Senator Sumner, on charges ranging from usurpation of military powers to the acceptance of a bull-pup from Sacramento, is said to be but a trifle as com pared with the ordeal through which the President will have to pass in the debate over the blunders of this Geneva Conference busi ness. He is to be arraigned for suffering the Joint High Commission to overreach bim on every point, even to the wording of the Treaty of Washington, and for leaving the interests of the United States In the hands of prejudiced foreigners. Even the dinners eaten by Secretary Fish in the company of the Joint High Commissioners are to be made a cause of complaint, after the fashion of the attacks upon Reverdy Johnson for bis sociable feasts with the London bons vivants, and the second serious attempt to settle the Alabama controversy by treaty stands a chance of being sacrificed to a singular prejudice against dinner-table companionship. There will bo no attempt to defeat the appro priation asked for by the administration, but, if our information be correct, the anti-Grant combination, While voting the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for expenses of the Con ference, will do their best to prove that the money will be thrown away, and that the whole thing will end in failure. Indeed, so wonderful is the prescience of the Washington politicians that we are not only assured of the disastrous termination of this arbitration, but are Informed of the exact time the news of the result is to reach this country. We are to receive it in the very midst of the next Presidential campaign, and its publica tion is to afford hope to the democraoy and to drive the last nail Into the political coffin of President Grant. In this we think we discover the Jesuitical hand of the "fallen and degenerate Latin race;" for are not the democracy mainly of the same religious faith and of the same family? And is not this foretold determination of the Geneva Congress, to burl their unfavorable decision upon us in the heat of our next Presidential election, nothing more nor less than a sobemo to defeat the republican party and to place a democrat in the White House? But the Joint High Commission, the Geneva Conference, the Spanish government and the Latin race are not to be allowed to have things all their own way. President Grant, as the story goes, is bent upon heading off this cunning plot against his administration by declaring war against Spain and striking for the annexation of Cuba to the United States. There has certainly been some serious apprehension at Madrid of a hostile movement on the part of our government, and the Herald's special despatches have already announced the excitement created in Spain by the allusion to Cuban affairs in President Grant's Message. The action of our present administration in regard to Cuba has thus tar been favorable to the Spanish authorities to a degree that has seriously displeased a majority of the American people. While the vigilanoe I of our government has prevented the sailing of numerous expeditions in favor of the Cuban patriots, thirty Spanish gunboats built here and known to be for the use of the Spanish government against the revolutionists were, after a brief detention, allowed to go free, and some flfly thousand stand of arms have been openly taken from our shores to Havana to aid the Spanish authorises in their cruel war against the Cubans. The people of the United States have protested against this as a violation of that neutrality which the government pro fesses to maintain. If a new departure should now really be taken ,by President Grant on Cuban affairs, it will add greatly to the popularity of bis administration. If the Spanish people are excited over the President's Message the people of the whole civilized wo Id are exoited over the atrocities committed by the Spaniards in Cuba, which are a disgrace to the civilized world. No war would be so popular in the United States as one that must have for its result the liberation of that island from the barbarous and brutal rule of a European monarchy, itself so effete as to be compelled to put up its tinselled throne at auction in a foreign market. It would be a splendid stroke of policy should General Grant resolvo to enter upon the next campaign under the banner of Cuban annexation or Cuban independence. Such an issue would give life and vigor to the election and would carry tho President triumphantly back to the White House. The folly and intemperance of Spain may yet reuder a war for this object impera tive upon the American republic. " Where There Is a Will There Is a Wat."?The democracy of New Hampshiro flo not appear to have "seen It." Ttie Prince of WbIm?Our LattM But letiu?"A Len Unquiet Maht." We bare an official bulletin from Sandring bam, of yesterday's date at ten P. M., which represents the Prince of Wales as having "a less unquiet night" than that of the day be fore ; which, we think, meanB a hopeful abate ment of his fever. In his case it may be said "while there is life there is hojje;" for at bis age, and considering his physical strength when attacked by this fever, the elasticity of his constitution may stiil save him. His physicians, very properly, have from the beginning been cautious and careful in their reports of his condition?first, in referenoe to bis danger, until fully convinced of it; and now, in the apparent change in bis favor, until satisfied that it justifies the hope of his s^covery. Ten years ago, on this day, the 14th of December, Prince Albert, the father of this young man, died from a violent attack of the same general charaoter of disease, and in the event of the death of the son on the same day of the month as that of the death of the father, an event which may happen, the consequences to Queen Victoria may well be feared. She has never known a happy day since the death of her husband, and brood ing ever since npon the uncertainties of earthly blessings and the mysteries and sorrows of death, this 14th of December, In reference to the Prince of Wales, will doubtless to the Queen be the most anxious, and, perhaps, the most dreadful and disastrous day of her whole existenoe. In this view, whether the Prince is from this attack to live or to die, we hope that he will at least be spared through this day, the day which, to his unhappy mother, is the darkest and most dreaded of all the days of the year. A Pbinoelt Gift.?The Grand Duke Alexis, through Admiral Possiet, has for warded to William H. Aspiuwall the sum of five thousand dollars, for distribution among the poor of New York, "wishiag them to feel that a visit which has afforded so much plea sure to him has been the occasion of some slight relief to them." Mr. Aspinwall has very judiciously appropriated one thousand dollars of the imperial gift to the Society for the Relief of the Destitute Children of Seamen? a graceful recognition of the profession to which the Grand Duke belongs. The remain ing four thousand dollars be has placed at the disposal of the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor of New York. This liberal aot of our Imperial visitor is well timed, and is not the least pleasing incident of his visit as an indication that, in the midst of the gayety that surrounds him, he does not overlook the fact that every great city has its full share of suffering and poverty. The Insurrection in Cubs is on the wane, to judge by the Havana despatch which we publish this morning In another column. Fifteen thousand Cubans are stated to have surrendered during last year, and several prominent leaders but lately in arms have signed a document which Is rather pro fuse in expressions of penitence and promises of future good behavior. This conversion seems too sudden to be genuine. The signers of the document may have been Induced by the Spanish authorities to cry ptccati, and to indulge in suoh fulsome assurances of loyalty for the purpose of obtaining Immunity from prosecu tion and punishment. But, nevertheless, the surrender of so many Cubans, coupled with the publication of their abjuration, will prob ably have a discouraging effect upon those remaining In armed opposition against the Spiolsktulkodtiih I'onirrM Yesterday ? The International Society In the Houne and OS-lal Cor ruption In the Senate. The House was engaged yesterday on a subject of great interest, the debate ou which will attract attention in ?urope as well as in this country. The quostion concerned is that whioh is looming up in giant proportions on both hemispheres, and threatening the upheaval of society as at present organized? the relations between labor and capital. The proposition which brought this ominous ques tion before the House was a bill, reported by Mr. Hoar, of Massachusetts, from the Commit tee on Education and Labor. It is simple and innoceat in its character, and yet it brings up the whole subjeot for discussion and considera tion. It merely proposes the appointment, by the President, of three commissioners, whose duty it shall be to investigate the subject of the wages and hours of labor, and of the division of the joint profits of labor and capital be tween the laborers and the capitalists, and the social, educational and sanitary condition of the laboring classes of this country, and how the same are affected by existing laws regu lating commerce, finance and currency. It is, according to Mr. Hoar's statement to the House, a measure that emanates from the labor party of Massachusetts, and that has the approvat and support of the great Interna tional Society of Workmen in Europe and America, as expressed through a council of that body held in London in October last. The very naino of the International, as the foster parent of this proposition, invests it with a prestige and character which its own terms would fail to lend to it. It drapes it in the terrible garb of French Com munism, free love and atheism, and brings to the imagination the frightful picture of Paris given over to flames, pillage and mas sacre. We do not mean to say that the mea sure itself contains anything which is not proper, or at loast defensible; but we do think that it would have occupied a better position before the country and the world if it had stood on its own merits and without the questionable aid and support given to it by the International. Mr. Hoar even went out of his way to pronounce something like a eulogium on the heroism of the young men and^young women of Paris who went to their deaths for the principles of the Commune as cheerfully as ever bridegroom went to the bridal feast. Perhaps Mr. Hoar is a disciple of Fourier, or perhaps he is only an aspirant for tho Presidency, and makes this bid for the support of that class of the community which, according to him, is bo powerful in this country that it may safely apply to itself the famous expression of the Grand Monarch, "L'ttatc'exl moi." But, considering the State which ho represents, the high social position which he fills and the fact that he has never been, like his fellow-citizen, Wendell Phillips, an agitator and doctrinaire, the speech that he made yesterday and the bill that he reported and advocated are remark able, as indicating the readiness of our public flieu to adapt themselves to every change of opinion and to seek personal position and power at whatever risk to the Commonwealth. It may also be, however, that Mr. Hoar, bo far from being actuated by any more selfish or unworthy motive, is simply influenced by the prognostics of impending dangers and by a statesmanlike desire to forestall and avert them. In that view of the case bis bill is even the more important. Of course such a measure could not be launched upon the House without inciting dis cussion. It bad come up, however, o ily as the business of the morning hour, and no longer time could be given for debate. Mr. Hoar was entitled to the whole hour for him self, but he yielded portions of it to his col league, Mr. Dawes, Mr. Shanks, of Indiana, and Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania. The first immediately set to work to make political capital out of it by expressing satirical regret that any opposition should be made to such a measure by democrats like Mr. Fernando Wood, who had objected to its being made a special order, and Mr. Kerr, of Indiana, who had moved to lay the bill on the table. Mr. Shanks supported the bill in a lukewarm man ner, preferring to it one which he had himself introduced last Monday, to establish a labor bureau. Mr. Kelley, however, went in for the measure with all his might and main, declaring that it was for the want of just such a thing that England bad lost her national prestige and was preparing for herself another revolu tion ; that France had seen the fires of the Commune kindled in Paris, and that Germany was training her young men in hostility to Church and throne. People less clairvoyant than the pig-iron mem ber from Pennsylvania might be inclined to attribute these national peculiarities rather to too much than to too little latitude enjoyed by the working classes; but then who would think of gainsaying such an authority ? Strangely enough, ho seemed to be impervious to the conviction that the first and chicfest step in the revolutionary movement of labor against capital would be to brush away all his cherished cobwebs of protection and leavo the iron and coal of Pennsylvania to take its chances with the iron of Sweden and the coal of Newcastle. When the good time comes for which Mr. Kelley was contending yesterday ws will hare no more class legislation, and the tariffs on pig iron and Bessemer steel will be remit ted among the dreams of things that were. The democrats had little chance to show their hand in this matter, but that little was rather in opposition to the scheme, which they probably look upon, and with some justifica tion, as a piece of simple demagoglsm. One of the Pennsylvania members on that side, however, did get an opportunity to express his opinion, and availed himself of it to the extent of proclaiming his adhesion to the measure as leading in the direction of a repeal of the tariff, the internal revenue laws and the national banking system. He protested that the democrats were always the peculiar friends of the working classes, and that the republicans were in this matter merely steal ing democratic thunder. No aotion was taken on the bill, which went over till the next morning hour, and may come up again for disoussion to-day. The re lation of labor to capital is, as we have inti mated, a very dangerous and delioate subjoot, and one In whioh legislative interferenoe is apt to do more injury than good. The Sonata JtfMMdUuok tM> WWO utavjWfe, tor day beyond tbeir wont That body bad quite a lively and animated discussion on the subject of corruption in office. The debate was started by the introduction of a resolution, by Mr. Anthony, of Rhode Island, tor the ap pointment of a Committee of Investigation and Retrenchment, to investigate and report on such subjects as might be referred to it by the Senate. To this Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, offered an amendment, direoting the committee to inquire, without further instructions, into the conduot of affairs in all departments of the government. Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, favored the original resolution; and Mr. Wil son, of Massachusetts, wishing to be "all things to all men," favored both propositions. Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, opposed the too general and sweeping effect of Trumbull's motion, argued that there was no necessity for it, and, with a magnificent disregard of public opinion and of the history of the day, declared that, in respect to official purity, the administration of the government for the last three years would compare favorably with that of George Washington himself. The re porter does not state that that oratorical bounce was greeted with ironical laughter or applause; but surely even the cold formality of the Senate Chamber could hardly re sist a demonstration at hearing the past and present so profanely compared. The great speech of the day, however, was made by the Senator from Germany, Carl Schurz, who supported Trumbull's amendment, referred to the numerous official defalcations of the last four months, revived the whole story of the frauds in the New York Custom House, under the general order system, insinuated that the gentleman who is being enriched by this sys tem of plunder got the position he holds through a letter of introduction from General Grant, and keeps up some sort of connection with the White House, and added that, how ever that might be, the fact remained that that same system of robbery was sustained against the views of the merchants of New York and against the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury. He described the country as standing on the threshold of a moral revolution, which bade fair to go even beyond the overthrow of Tammany Hall, and declared that if the Senate wished to serve tbo country and command its confidence it must show that it hated no party more than it hated corruption, and that it loved no party more than it loved good government. These wero brave words of Master Carl, the only drawback to them being that they covered as much personal feeling against the administra tion as they did high and patriotic motives. That, at least, was the insinuation of Senator Conkling, who followed in the debate; and wo are rather inclined to think that, for once, Roscoe the Magnificent was not very far astray. After all this fine speecum.iking no action was taken, and the matter went over till the Senate is again in humor to take it up. Trimming and Evasive?The platform of the New Hampshire democracy. Tht Now Hampshire Democracy'?Their State Convention Yesterdny. The democracy of New Hampshire held their State Convection yesterday at Concord. Some interest has been attached to the pro ceedings of this Convention outsido the borders of the State, for the reason that New Hampshire is the only democratic State within the boundaries of the six New England States. The resolutions of the Convention held yes terday may bo summarized as follows :? 1. That tho party is pledged to the perpetuity of the Union. 1 The protection of the right of every cittzen In accordance with lundamental laws. 8. Opposition to every spee'es of corruption In all departments of municipal, dtato and national gov ernment. 4. No privileged classes, no privileged capital 6. In favor of a tariff that raises money for the necessary expenses or the federal government, not for the beneQt of monopolists. The resolutions farther declare that the establishment of martial law in the South is unconstitutional and atrocious; advocate reform in the civil service of the government, and reaffirm the confidence of tho party in Governor Weston. Governor Weston has been renominated. The above is, in brief, the platform of the New Hampshire democracy. It is very good so far as it goes. Bat it fails in an essential point. It does not declare whether the democ racy of New Hampshire are In favor of a coali tion polioy or whether they are not; whether they look to a passive or "possum" or "polly wog" platform in the next Democratic National Convention, or whether they will stiffen their backbone and declare for a grand national reform democratic policy which will, at least, make tho democracy of tho Union respected, although it may be defeated. A Full Field fob tiie Republicans in 1872?The entire New England States. The Augusta (Ga.,) Chronicle announces tbaf an administration party has been organ ized in Georgia. What party was Bullock at the head of, and what party does his succes sor, Conley, now lead? Senator Morton's Adjournment Reso lution.?Mr. Morton has introduced a resolu tion in the Senate providing for the final adjournment of this session of Congress on the third Monday in May next. We presume that Mr. Morton's idea in this proposition is to fix a reasonable limit to the session, in order that the two houses may work up to it. The anti-Grant republicans and the democrats, however, are opposed to fixing a limit to the session, because there is a prospect in keeping the two houses open, each as a Presidential debating society, that "something may turn up" in the distraction and divisions of the. administration forces to the disadvantage of General Grant. The long session of 1859- 60 did as much to bring about the breaking up of the democratic party on the slavery question and the election of Abraham Lincoln as anything else, and, gen erally, a long session of Congress on tho threshold of a Presidential contest, works to the disadvantage of the party In power. The Mobile Jtegitter, referring to tho passive democracy, says, "It Is wiser to keep in the way of fortune and God's blessings." [t Is about time the democraoy commence^, jetting In the way of the latter, for tbey hatr'e been going to the other plaoe so long that they loera almost to have been forgotten In That land of pore delight vymm mui* not auums. aveik A "?w Inextlacnlahable Storm and DaifW SUmal Lliht. It ia with pleasure we oall publlo attention to this important invention. The perfection of their signals has long been a study of civilised nations. From earliest historio periods ws know of the use made by the rudest people of the fire signal, which is still employed by our Western Indians to give warning of an enemy's approach. But the necessities of commerce and science, as well as that of war, require the most reliable and multiform signals. The invention of whioh we speak was an. nounced in this country a short time ago, and might be utilized on our coaBte in the life boat servioe, which has engaged so much the attention of the maritime public. This new signal is a most remarkable devioe, and was first exhibited in England last April, at the President's meeting of the Royal Society, when it attracted great attention. The peculiarities of the signal light aro that it is self-igniting when placed 4n the water or thrown into the sea. Contact with water being the only means of igniting the lamp, it is inextinguish able when once kindled, and is not at all affected by wind or storm. The light is visible at great distances, and is said to be so bril liant that photographs may be taken in it, and yet it is of great duration. Experiments made before a number of scientific gentlemen to determine its brilliancy as a signal show that a lamp plunged in a bucket of water on the top of Primrose Hill emitted a light so intense that after the signal had been burning twenty minutes "small newspaper print could be distinctly read at a distance of seveuty feet, though the night was thick and foggy." It will burn over forty minutes, and can there fore be used for a great variety of purposes. In case of shipwreck a few of the lamps (which are very simple and inexpensive in their manufacture) can be thrown upon the sea, and their illumination of the entire soene, it is claimed, would enable assistance to be promptly and most efficiently rendered to those in distress. For the rocket liue apparatus it is equally valuable, as, bursting into a brilliant flume on touching the water, it would indicate the exact position of the rocket line. As regards its attachment to life buoys, it would be a mark to a drowning sailor, and iu lifeboat service it would greatly facilitate the rescue. Last year we had the horrible lesson of the Hudson River Railroad disaster to learu. Such a signal as this is described to be, in the hands of railroad men might prove available and of great utility; and it is certainly worth a trial by our marine, railway and storm-signal service organizations. The chemical preparation contained in the lamp is a hard solid, and non-explosive and not affected by heat, and the lamp is so made that when once used it can be entirely thrown away. A London scientific journal says "the difficulties of preparing the chemical com pound have beou entirely overcome by the contractors for the manufacture of the lamp for the patentee." A little patient pursuit and trial of such inventions on the part of officials responsible for the public safety might an nually save hundreds of lives. Tub First Blast for the democracy in 1872 has fl ished in the pan by the ilal platform of the New Hampshire democracy. Tlie Czarovltch Alexander and the German Auibawtador. According to a despatch which appeared yes terday in the London Standard, and which we publish this morning, St. Petersburg has found a fresh sensation. The Czarevitch Alexander, the eldest living son of the Emperor, became involved in a privato dispute with tho Prince de Reuss, the German Ambassador. Both, it seems, lost their temper; and the Czarovitch so far forgot himself as to make a personal as sault on the Ambassador. As might hare been expected, the affair has occasioned tre mendous excitement. It Is feared that conse quences of a grave character may result. As the dispute related to private matters, it is not supposed that the affair will at all interrupt the friendly relations existing between Russia and Germany. This is not the first time that the Romanoffs have revealed a shoulder-hitting propensity. It will be remembered that many years ago a similar encounter took place be tween the Emperor Nicholas and the Count of Brandenburg. The Prussian government dis covered that Russia and Austria and Franoe had agreed to make csrlaiu territorial appro priations. France was to get the Rhenish Provinces, Austria was to take Silesia and Posen was to fall to the lot of Russia. The Count of Brandenburg, the undo of the pres ent Rmperor of Germany, w?s hurried off to St. Petersburg to prevent the execution of tho plan. The Emperor Nicholas, it is said, waxed so furious that he struck Count Brandenburg with violence. The Count was so humiliated by the affront that, on bis return to Berlin, be shot himself. Shoulder-hitting seoms to be, after all, qulto as much a propensity with princes as with Tammany politicians. It is not a pretty affair as it stands. Art in America.?Mr. White's collection of paintings realized about ninety thousand dollars. We have here the strongest proof bow firmly art taste is taking root among us. That such a large amount of money ahonld be realized at a time when trade is notoriously depressed would show how deep is the in terest taken in art subjects ; but the most pleasing feature of this generous patronage was the excellent judgment displayed by the pur chasers. Just in proportion to the merit of the works was tho desire to possess them, and all the skill of the auctioneer was not suf ficed to draw the purchasers beyond what they knew to bo the real value of the paintings. In a few years more New York will bo as im portant to the artists of the world as it is to the merchants, and under the generous patronage which our citizens extend to ark. we may reasonably expect to see a natiyW school developed that will not be unwortby^/f our future. Bank Troubles.?The lailure of the'Obeaa Bank has been followed by the suspebskin of two small concerns up town, the *Eighth National and the Union Squars National; Banks. The latter, after standing airun on It for two days, was hurriedly thrown Into the hands of a receiver yosterday afternboa.
