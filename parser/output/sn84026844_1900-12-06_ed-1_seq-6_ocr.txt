EACH COUNTY BE i < Senator Davis Opposed to Ripping up the State at the Coming Session of Legislature. ^ THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS Are Satisfactory-Favors Electing One Congressman at Large. Judicial Circuits. ? Gn~?i>ln\ TVannlnW * ?1i? l GRAFTON, W. Va., Dec. Z.?Inns. much a s tho question of redlatrlctlng the state by the next legislature Is provoking considerable discussion at this time, your correspondent called upon Hon. Thomas E. Davis, senator-eleot from this district, at hla olllce, this evening, and Inquired If ho had given tho matter any consideration, as yet, and it so, I would be glad to learn his vlqws, Tho senator Is a gentleman who usually has very decided views upon every question of public Interest, and he promptly replied that he had already given some thought to the subject und6r consideration. Not in Favor of Ripping. ""What conclusion have you arrived at, senator?'* was asked. "Well," said he, '-while I am for redisricting the state, at the same time I do not think it good policy or good polltics to rip up the state sololy for partisan advantage, as was done by the Democratic party In 1891.' I was in the senate at that time, and I know they expected, by that gerrjjmander to hold the stato indefinitely, and they were consequently dumb-founded when they awoke on the morning after the election of 1894,-to find that a Republican legislature had been elected and a United States senator lost t/> them. I do not think wo should follow their example now, after so bitterly denouncing their gerrymandering Job from the time the bill was passed to the present. This would be Inconsistent, it seems to me, to say the least. Each. County Should bo Eepresented. ."I think, like many others," continued the senator, "that each county should have a member of the legislature, and by taking a basis say, of 1,200, this could be. done with an Increase to the house of only thirteen members, without o-ny legislative districts, thus making the total membership of the house eighty-four. The senatorial districts might then be increased also to sixteen, thus making thirty-two members of the senate, an increase of only six, which would be a fair proportlonment to the houf?e. The total increase to both branches would then aggregate but nineteen, and the legislature in its entirely would be composed of 11C members in all." "Senator, would you not consider that a small assembly for a state that is growing an rapidly as ours?" Bodies Must Not Be too Large. "I think not," replied Mr. Davis, "for you,must remember that wo have increased the legislature by only two members In the senate and seven In the house since the organization of the state, and I have grave doubts If too large a body would be for the best Interests of the state, any more than too great a majority would be best for the party in power. Besides each member added would cost, the state about $2K0 annually In tho way of per diem, mileage, &c., &c., and even at my figures the Increase would cost the state nearly 55,CMl0 additional per ennum. These are matters to be carefully considered." "What do you say as to the congres slonal districts, senator?" As to Congressional Districts. "As to the congressional districts," he thoughtfully answered, "I do not think they can be much Improved upon by any readjustment, and.as our Democratic'friends arranged tliem as they are, they certainly cannot complain if we continue them as at present. Besides," said lie, "a change now would break up old and pleasant associations In existing districts, and, therefore, If ; we are to have an additional representative in Congress, after a reapportionment has been made by that body, I am favorably inclined toward the Pennsylvania plan of having one congri-samanat-large." "What is your opinion, senator, as to . the Judicial districts, ghould they be redistricted, do you think?" Let Judicial Districts Alone. "No, -I think they should remain as SHOULD REPRESENTED. they are< also, ais'I do not know of any judge that is {. specially* overworked In 1^3' district, ami rather than increase ; the J'umber of districts, I would, If pas-! sJble, increase the salary of the several judges, but as this can not be done.1 without a constitutional amendment, I presume th?y will have to be contented \ylth their presUUit compensation." ' "Senator, do yuij contemplate pcesentinsr a bill on the lines indicated in this Interview?" v.u, muy ?ruf oniy my inuiviuuai views at present. I suppose, however, that tho two houses will appoint a joint commlttce to formulate ji bill anil present to both houses for approval or disapproval." "Jn conclusion! senator," was the last] question asked, '"what is your opinion. of the character of the senate?" "What do X. think of the senate?" | warmly replied Mr. Davis," I think it Is an excel/rent body and fairly distributed as to business men, farmers and lawyers. I believe this also holds good with reference to the house, and 1 predict "very conservative, business session, as it should be if we expect to retain the confidence of the people and continue to control the state." cramp' company May Sell Its Vast Ship Building Plant to an English Syndicate.

FALLEN WOMEN j Leaving the Red Light Districts in New York. i NEW YORK, Dec. 4.?Scores of woj men. driven from their rooms in the ! district known as the rod light district left the neighborhood to-day. The excdus was the result of the move of the authorities against the landlords who own the tenements In which the women lived, and who in turn served the women with dispossess notices. The unfortunates got out of the city, some to Brooklyn, others to New Jersey, while some are said to have gone to the large eustern citjon.

WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY Being Tested in Europe?Succeasful Operations Between Land and Steamers Forty Miles Out. "WASHINGTON. D. C? Dee. 5.?Consul Tlooscvelt, at Brussels, reports to thp utute department that a station has been established at La Panne, Belgium, for the exchange of wireless telegraphic messages between Belgium and England. La Panne was selected on account of Its being the point of the Belglum Lltteral nearest the English coast and a mast of the Marconi system, ISO feet high, was erected there. The Dover mall boat, Princess Clementine, was lltted up with temporary apparatus for use In experimental trials. An additional inast was uftlxed to the forema:-.t of this vessel, Increasing Its original height about GO feet. Frojn the extremity the telegraphic waves are projected towards each coast. A special room has been fitted up on the steamer for the instruments, and from that room the cable Is carried to the top of the extended mast. Able to Keep in Touch With Zand. It is confidently expected to maintain f communication between ship und shore t for nt least thirty miles, which is about * half way across. With stations at La t Panne and Dover those on board the vessel will be able to keep in touch 4 with the land during1 the entire trip [ across. Recent experiments showed . that replies arrived with the same regularity and celerity as ordinary telegrams. When about forty miles from Ostcnde the captain was a|!e to telegraph the station master at Ostendo the probable hour of his arrival. Various telegrams were sent from the vessel to Ostende, Brussels, Dover and London, and the reception" of each mes- / sage was acknowledged promptly. Subsequently, the consul adds, a message was sent from the vessel to the sta- j tion at Dover court.
