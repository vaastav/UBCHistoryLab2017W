There are unmistakable siins that the republican party is showing won derful vitality as an opposition par ty. This was not only inilicatoil by the t-ongressional elections last year, by which the democratic inajonty in the house of representatives was re duced from 40 to lo, but it has Wen indicated this year in nearly all the elections held from Maine to Califor nia. There is no loss of republican states, no flagging in the republican host. Party distractions and faction al liues have disappeared. Not only Lave the ranks solidified but there is an enthusiasm pervading the party that has not appeared so strikingly for yeais. Nor is it mere enthusiasm, llai nest purposes underlie it. As the re publican patty in the majority was the let party that the country ever had. This does not consist alone in keeping vigilant watch of the demo cratic party, and especially of the democratic administration. That is necessary aud useful. But a Ligher work remains. That work is the suggestion and formulation of meas ures for the further advancement of the country and of the jeople. A rrkd when no one issue overtops fl.ll others is just the perk-d for piac tical legislation ami the practical statestuaa. It may not be a time when men shiae. bqt is a time when their talents may be employed to great uses. The republicans in congress have waited three years for the adminis tration to present soaje policy. The best it can do now is to attack the tariff, running the risk of up-jetting business and precipitating a pauic. ,The republicans propose to vppo&e the scheme, while at the ame time furnishing rtlief in other and Letter directions. The sugar and tobatt-o taxes should go bef ore the home mar ket is thrown open to foreigu manu factures. Our merchant marine should be. encouraged bofore our home industries are distributed.

A New York Tribune reporter in terviewed 31 r. P.laine iu Paris on the th instant, who said: "1 have been reading au abstract of the president message and am especially interested in the comments of the London pa ners. Those naners all assume to , , - i i. ! declare the message a free-trade nian I ifesto, evidently anticipating an en larged market for Knglish fabrics in the I'nited States as a consequence of the president's recommendations Perhaps that fact stariiped the char acter of the message more clearly than any words of mine can. This is the first time within the history of the United States the president rec ommends retaining the internal tax that the tariff mav be forced down even below a fair revenue standard lie recommends that the tax ou to bacco be retained. Thus many mil lions will annually be levied on thij domestic product which might far better come from the tariff on foreign fabrics. I should urge the repeal of the tobacco tax at once, even Defore the Christmas holidays. It would bring great relief to the growers of to bacco all over the country and world ; moreover, it would materially lessen the price of the article to the consum ers. Tobacco to millions is a neces sity. The president calls it a luxu rv. It is such a luxury as tea and coffee. Watch the men on the farm, in the iron foundry, in any calling; you will find ninety-five in every hun dred using it. After each meal the ame proportion seek the solace of the pipe or cigar. These men pay the millions of the tobacco tax, pay on every plug of tobacco or cigar an enhanced price which the tax enables the manufacturer and retailer to im pose. Whiskev would be everywhere dis tilled if the surveillance of the gov ernment was withdrawn by the re mission of the tax. Whiskey has done a vast deal of harm, and I would try to make it do some good. I would use the tax to fortify the cities on the sea-board. In view of the powerful letter addressed to the dem ocratic party by the late Samuel J. Tilden in 1S.", I am amazed that no attention has been paid to the subject by the democratic administration. Never before in the history of the world has any government allowed its great cities on the sea-board to remain defenceless ; and after forti fications are constructed I would still maintain the tax on whiskey, and when the national government had no use for the money would divide the tax among th federal Union with the specific object of lightening the tax on real estate, houses and firms. The whole country pays too large a proportion of the total taxes. If ultimately relief could not be giv en in that direction, it would, in my judgment, be a wise and beneficial policy. Some honest aud misguided friends of temperance have urged that the government should not use the money derived from the tax on whiskey. My reply is that the tax on whiskey, with suppression of all illicit distillation and with the consequent enhance ment of the price, has been a power ful agent in temperance reform by putting it beyond the reach of so many. I should seriously object to the re peal of the duty on wool, as it would work great injustice to many inter ests. The question of labor under lies the whole subject. It is, in fact, the entire question. Whenever we can force artisans in every depart ment to work cheaply and live as pooily in the United States as simi lar workmen in Europe, we can, of course, manufacture just as cheaply as they do, but I am totally opposed to the policy it would entail. To at tempt it is equivalent to a social and financial revolution that would bring untold distress. The moment you begin to import freely from Europe yon drive your own workmen from mechanical and manufacturing pursuits. In the same proportion they become tillers of the soil, increasing steadily the agricul tural product and decreasing steadily the large home demand which is con stantly enlarging as honie manufac tures enlarge. That, of course, works great injury to the farmer, glutting the market with his products and tending constantly to lower prices. I do not mean to imply there should be no reduction of the national sur plus. 1 would reduce it by the prompt repeal of the tobacco tax ; make some changes in tariff ; not reduce protec tion, but wisely foster it. No great system of revenue like our tariff can operate with efficiency and equity un less the changes of the trade he close ly watched and the law promptly adapted to the changes. In the -act of l s- we made changes of the char acter I have tried to indicate. If such changes are made and the forti fying and sea-coast thus undertaken, at very moderate annual outlay, no surplus will be found after that al ready accumulated is disposed of The president's recommendation to admit raw material will not find a strong support by wise protectionists. It is vastly more important not to lose our own great market for our own people in the vain effort to reach the impossible. It is not our foreign trade that has caused the wonderful growth aud expansion of the repub lic. It is the vast domestic trade be tween thirty-eight states and eight territories, with their population of terhaps 62,CW,0o0 to-day. The whole amount of our export and im- port trade together has never, I think, reached I,y,C-w,uo0 any one year. Our internal home trade oa J3',0A miles of railway, aloug l-,iju miles of ocean coast, over the five great lakes and along 20,W0 miles of nav igable rivers, reaches the enormous f annual aggregate of more than $iJ,- nitude not dreamed of twenty years ago, that the Europeans are strug gling to enter. It is the heritage of the American people, of their chil dren and of their children's children. It gives an absolutely free trade over a territory nearly as large as all Eu rope, and the profit is all our own. The-genuine free-trader appears un able to see or comprehend that this continental trade not our exchanges with Europe is the great source of our prosperity. President Cleveland now plainly proposes a policy that will; admit Europe to a share of this trade. The president's message will bring the country where it ought to be brought to a full and fair contest on the question of protection. The president himself makes it the one is sue by presenting no other. I think it well to have the quesiion settled while the democratic party is iu pow er. It is a standing menace to the industrial prosperity of the country. Nothing is so mischievous to busi ness as'uncertainty, nothing so para lvzing as doubt." 

WASHINGTOH LETTER. SPBClAI-CORRBSPOXDEJiCE OF THE dOSITOR. Washing con, Dec. 12th. In the political world the bold message of the president is the chief topic of discussion, and while there are diverse opinions concerning its expediency and practicability, men of all parties willingly concede Mr. Cleveland the courage of his convic tions something really refreshing in a candidate for the presidency, be cause so rarelv seen. jiany ions- headed politicians express the belief that the president's course on the only real vital issue of the day, will cause new alignment of parties in the next presidential struggle, and ou the most exciting contests in the his tory of the country. Mr. Blaine's swift criticism of the message is practically regarded as a declaration of his own candidacy for the presi- ienev as the champion of the protec tion principle. It is thought here that the calliug of the national repub- ican convention at Chicago was due to the Blaine influence, and that it foreshadows his re-nomination. Congress was organized quietly, and in a manner becoming the dignity of that bodv on its centennial annivers ary, despite the bloodshed in the dem ocratic caucus and the anticipations of a dead-lock in the senate, the only interruption being from a religious enthusiast, who, at the moment of most intense silence in the house, chanted the doxology in a plaintive solo, greatly to the amusement of fully oOOO spectators ; the poor man was cared for by the police, but he succeeded in favoring the president with the same tune at his reception. As usual on such occasions, many of the desks were burdened with beau tiful floral favors, the gifts of admir ing frieuds. Only brief sessions of congress were held the past week, as the com mittees have not yet been formed : Speaker Carlisle says that he hopes to be able to announce the house committees before the holiday recess ; but he lias a very difficult task before him, for there are about 125 new members to place. It is a remarka ble fact that two-thirds of the chair- mee of the house committees of the last congress were decapitated by their constituents. A plausible rea son for these changes is that the im portunate congressmen, m dividing the spoils, did not have enough offic es to distribute ; and many familiar faces are missing from the places that will know them no more forever. The only committee yet appointed in either house or senate is the com mittee on mileage of the house, which, as far as circumstances would permit, is the same as formerly, and this is rather an indication that, as far as practicable, the speaker means to re appoint the same old committees. The bitterness engendered among the democrats over the doorkeeper ship fight has brought to light allega tions that both Donelson and Wimer mith, late incumbents of that office, are defaulters, and it is whispered about the capitol corridors that the republicans will introduce -a resolu tion for the appointment of a com mittee to investigate the accounts of these officials. It is believed that the nominations of Lamar for associate justice of the supreme court, Vilas for secretary of the interior, and Dickinson for post mastei general, will be confirmed without difficulty by the senate. The Evangelical Alliance of the United States, embracing 2000 dele gates, and numbering among its mem bership many of the most eminent di vines of the country, held its session in the capital the past week, and the occasion was a season of glorious spiritual edification to thousands of Christian believers whose privilege it was to attend these meetings.- One of the most pdeasant events of the meeting of the alliance was the president's reception of the organiza tion in a body, the members being personally introduced to the chief ex ecutive by Wni. E. Dodge. When it i came the turn of the Rev; Dr. Burch ard, who made the famous allitera tive allusion in references to rum. Romanism and rebellion, in the last presidential campaign, a general j smile went around, aud it was especi- j allv bright on the faces of Mr. and 3Ir s. Cleveland, both of whom ex- j ded a very cordial greeting to the tended noted divine, who also appeared to share fullv the spirit of the situation.. .Senator Edinuuds comes promptly forward with his bill for a postal telr egraph.

It appears that Minister Phelps had takeu precisely the same ground that the representatives of our conn try in this commission have taken, aud ex-Gov. Diugley of Maine, who appeared for the fishing interest, savs that Canada is acting the part wf Shvlock. The affair may end in ar bitration if an independent board can be agreed upon. When Senator Edmunds stood at the bar of the United States Senate on Monday last, to take the oath of office, he did so for the sixth time He took it first ou the 4th of March lNiiG, when he held the office by the appointment ofGov. Dillingham. He took it next on the 4th of March 1SG7, having been elected by the leg islature to fill out the unexpired term of Senator Foot. He took it again after each of his four successive elec lions to tne tun term. iy tne way, the remark printed in the New York T-ibuite, the other day, that Mr. Ed munds was not a United States sena tor because he had not been sworn in since his last election, was not quite correct. A man begins to be a Unit ed States senator from the day of the commencement of his term and is en titled to draw his pay as such. Mr Edmunds' present term commenced ou the 4th of March last ; and there has been no intermission in his teiv ure of the office for the last twentv- oue vears. The veterans of the Eighth Ver mont regiment will feel the death of Gen. William II. Emrov, which took place in Washington on the 1st inst They served under him, as command er of the nineteenth corps, in the Shenanhoah valley, and he thought much of the regiment and its com mander. Gen. Thomas. Gen. Emrov was a graduate of West Point in the class of lHol. He was a major of the Second in 1.5, and was lieuten ant colonel of the First cavalry when the war of the rebellion broke out. He was appointed brigadier-genera of volunteers May 17, 162, and ma jor-geueral September loth, 165 He was promoted to colonel of Fifth cavalry October 27, 103 ; also re ceiviug the brevets for gallant war service of colonel, brigadier-genera aud maior-geueral, Lnited States army. He was retired with the rank of brigadier-general July 1, 1A,6 Gen. Emroy was a noble gentleman, and a soldier possessed of the high est sense of honor and duty aud true in every respect to the best standards of his profession. Senator Edmunds answers a host of free-trade sophistries, including the crude re-hash of stale theories in President Cleveland's message, when he says : "You remember that the tax on tea aud coffee was taken off some years ago, aud what was the result? The income from these prod ucts was withdrawn from the treasu ry, but the prices of tea and coffee remained as high as ever. The im porters made the extra profit, and we lost the taxes." The notion that the removal of the tariff duties inevita bly results in gain to the consumer is one of the most glaring of hoarv- ueaueu liee-iraue lunacies. it nas been exposed again and again, and it is simply astounding that the chief magistrate of this great nation should re- assert it without qualification. Senator Morrill on Monday intro duced a bill to regulate immigration, requiring American consuls on appli cation to inquire about and certify to the moral character and ability' to earn support of intending immigrants. It levies a duty of -$2 a head on for eigners not having a certificate, and requires a transportation under pen alty to return immigrants not found to be fit to become citizens. For eigners coming temporarily for pleas ure or business are exempt from the provisions of the act. There ought to be general acquiescence in a meas ure of this scope. Tuesday was a great day for the republicans in "Massachusetts. They redeemed Lowell and Lynn,and gave Mayor- O'-ifrien such a squeeze in Boston that he will hardly think of running again.. Ilis plurality has been -Fncc-es&ively reduced from in 1KK5, to 4668 in 1886, and 1539 in 1887.
