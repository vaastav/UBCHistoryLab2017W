The nomination of Charles L. Har ris, to be register of the land office in this city, will meet with the ap proval of not only the Republicans, but men of all political faith in East ern Montana. Mr. Harris is well known. He is a splendid attorney, and hence is pe culiarly equipped for the duties of the office. As a public officers he has been tried, and has given an excellent ac count of himself. C. L. Harris won public approval an4 the gratitude of his party during the campaign just ended. He was a candidate for the nomination of coun ty attorney. He made a fair and .-quare, open and above board fight, and lost the nomination. Then, in a ringing speech that sent the convention into a storm of ap plause and aroused the greatest en thusiasm, he arose, and moved to make unanimous the nomination of his successful oppoent, concluding with the statement that he would sup port the ticket from top to bottom, particularly the worthy gentleman who secured the nomination. That speech was as brilliant as it was extemporaneous. It came from the man's heart. Then came the campaign, and Char lie Harris was found in the thick of the fight-he seemed to be every where-and always at the most oppor tune moment. He was a factor in the campaign. His work and enthusiasm won hun dredB of friends, and after it was over, the question naturally arose: S"What can we do for Harris?" "Let's recommend him for register of the land office," And almost before he knew it, the petition had been drawn up, and he was swept in on a tidal wave of pop larity. This, In brief, is the record o.of thle new register, whose loyalty '-:;'never wavered and, who showed him self' to-ie great in defeat, and hence the aetter qualified for success whlich.he has attained without effort on his part.

The bill to create another federal judicial district for iMontana would be ll" right, if it divided, the state in such aimanner that court would be held in the eastern portion. As we read the dispatches from Washington, however, it proposes to leave the court of one district in He lena, where it is located at the pres ent time, and establish the headquar ters of the' new district in Butte. All of which is very nice-for Hele na and Butte. But how about the liti gants in the eastern portion of the state, who are thereby compelled to travel a distance equal to that be tween Chicago and St. ,Louis, to reach either Helena or Butte in order to attend court? If it is proposed to do that, in order to benefit the eastern portion of the state-for as we understand it, the bill is introduced in response to the demand of the citizens of Eastern Montana-then the district had better remain as at present constituted for the good reason that the new court, located in Butte will not benefit, in point of convenience, Eastern Mon tana. If a new district is created-and it should be-the court should be located in Eastern Montana-not necessarily in Billings, but in any event in the eastern part of the state which is growing so rapidly. There is no good reason for locating it in Butte, for that place shows a positive loss-the vote in the last elec tion is the barometer. To locate the court in Butte-or any other place west of (Bozeman would be to shame fully disregard the 'best interests of that section of the state that is not only growing faster 'than any other, but that bids fair in a few years to have the preponderance of population. A 

RICH BEGGAR GOES TO JAIL. A New York beggar, who flys under the title of Mr. William Abbott Fos ter, has just been sent to jail for six months. He was convicted of vag rancy. Mr. William Abbott Foster occupied the royal suite at-one of the principal hotels. That means that he had to advance $250 per day for the apart mnnts--just the rooms, mind you. Board, tips to waiters, and so on were extr. You see, William Abbott Foster knows a thing or two. He might stand out on the street corner with an "I am blind" sign on his precious back, and thereby rake in the shekels-but he sought bigger game. Besides, the cold of New York is biting at the present season, and he desires the same comforts royal beggars enjoy. He would be in the de Castellane and de Sagan class. So he rented swell apartments, and, with engraved stationery, proceeded to write to a number of rich menn Some of them visited him. They were stunned by the splendor in which he lived, admired his gall, and came through with the coin. It was easy. i He reached higher, and sought for larger sums, for success made him greedy. Then he made a mistake. He tack led an almost unheard of man, a men dicant by the name of John D. Rock efeller, who might have died unknown to fame had it not been for this beg gar. He sought money from this man Rockefeller, and the letter was promptly turned over to the police. They unearthed similar missives to Carnegie, Schwab, Morgan and others who are struggling to get along in the world, and who need all the ready cash they have to pay their coal bills. - -1 1 , Then a thick necked, low-browed man from the "Central Office" called at the hotel, and had a chat with ?Mr. William Abbott Foster. This fel low, a coarse individual who lives a life devoid of romance, smoked big black cigars and smiled under cover of a red face. He talked Lo Mr. Fos ter-and then locked him in a cell. Notwithstanding the fact that he had accumulated $100,000 through the medium of his begging letters, he was declared by the unfeeling courts of Mantattan, to be a vagrant, and was sentenced to serve six months on Blackwell's island. "Ain't it awful?" Now, if Mr. William Abbott Foster had taken that money down on Wall street and lost it, his sentence would not have been more severe. If he had managed to tear a chunk out of the street, and in the process robbed widows and orphans, the New York jolice would salam every time he oassed. Instead they put him in jail-and dlammed the door.

Whatever the president had in mind when he wrote the special mes sage will doubtles be revealed as a result of the resolution adopted by the senate.

APPALLING- LIST'-. : When one reads the list of workmen who were killed or injured during the past year, one is appalled. It is hard to believe, that more lives were lost in industrial pursuits, and more men were injured, in the twelve months just closing, than the army and navy recorded losses in the entire Spanish American war. Thlis calls to mind the fact that leg islation is necessary to at least min imise the number of accidents. The quickest way -to accomplish this, of course, is to make the employer re sponsible in a manner that attaches a very heavy penalty. Under present conditions the bur den falls on the workman. According to a bulletin on- accidents issued by the national bureau of labor, 35,000 workmen were killed and 200, 000 injured in -the past twelve months. in the railroad world, 7.46 deaths per thousand occur annually. The men are compelled to maintain a pace -that robs their work of the very element of safety which the fam ily has every right to demand, and that the employer should 'be required to provide. o-- THE 

WORLD'S GREATEST LIAR. Castro is the biggest liar on earth. If Ananias were alive, he would go howling to the desert-yea, verily, his occupation would be amputated. With the gravity of an owl, the Ven euelan Dictator that was, says there have been no disturbances in his land. He knows. Also he doubts the stories about the Dutch seizing -his ships, because that would make pirates of the Holland ers. For cool effrontery, this fellow cer tainly makes all the bunco men, him flam artists, surething workers and grafters look like a half a peck of very cheap skates. Whatever may be said about him, he has a system that is strikingly original, and as successful as it is novel. TO OUR CITRON -FLAVORED FRIENDS. It those fellows up in Butte put up a job to beat Paul McCormick out of :he messengership they will be lock 'ng up a jack-in-the-box that will pop Jut at the next election just 1h time to frighten their ambition -to the hard path of political defeat. Eastern Montana elects the Repub lican tickets-without it there can be to victory. If they do not believe it, there is no more certain way of dem onstrating the fact than by ignoring the rights of this section of the state. IWere the case exactly reversed, we have an oil painting of the denizens of Silver Bok shaking hands with them selves and passing the lemon basket to the balance of the state. In this regard, however, we hold :1 umps. And while Silver Bow may possess many a lemon, full large and juicy, we again remind the overzealous 'of that section that it requires the united Re publican vote of Eastern Montana to overcome the citron flavored Republi can politics of Silver Bow county. Now it is proposed to ship 10,000 unemployed men from New York to the west. In this respect the western states following the example of Texas in the Coxey army case, should compel the railroads to keep them moving. If the east does not want to care for the paupers, it's a cinch that we do not Rant to be burdened with them. -------- ---- Any gentle rain fall in Billings will' convert the avenues into a quagmire. We are still spending money to keep our streets in a primitive condition. The same sum would maintain fine pavements.

Thus we are to have strenuous times, even unto the end of the present ad ministration. President Castro's statements that Venquzela does not own the two ships captured by the Dutch is literally true. They belong to Holland now. Whatever the outcome of the Brownsville affair, the chances are even that cull'ed regiments will ner er try that trick again. ----0^----- We respectfully call 'the attention of the world to the fact that Alfalfa Tea was discovered in Yellowstone, county.

MILWAUKEL PURCHASES TRACT NEAR BILLINGS (Continued from First Page.) It means 'that Billings will be a big point on the line and confirms the in formation previously printed in The Gazette. , There are two preliminary surveys completed to this city, but those who are in a position to know, state that the line will tap the richest sections of agricultural land in the Yellowstone valley. Mr. Foster purchased 140 acres of which he has just sold 90 acres for $1,500, on time payments some years ago, and the sale to the railroad com. pany shows how rapidly realty has ad vanced in Billings in the past few years. The' sale of the land to the Milwau kee company which has been pending for some time, was common talk on the streets yesterday and the news was received joyously by the business men and citizens of Billings. It has been known for some time that the road would build here, but this abso lutely clinches matters for now the road is assured. POLICE COURT. S. T.

Mr. Taft arrived at the White House at the president's regu lar luncheon hour. As this was the last opportunity the president will have to discuss with Mr. Taft his Pa nama trip, it is believed that subject occupied most of their time.

EALTH O THE JUDITH BASN TREASURE VALLEY OF MONTANA Has a taklilg name and many ad valitages, and not a few disadvantages. rhose who go there to "wr!te up" the country, generally are guests of trans portation companies, and the tempta tion is great to say about all thath can *e said of its good qualities, and to :ouch lightly, it at all, its falllgs. But the settler going there, or to anyother location, should, if possible, "know it all." It is more important, in fact, to know the leading drawbacks of a coun try one is going to, than to know its greatest advantages; that is, of course if 'one is moving there with a family and intends to stay. Few know, or at least seem to, that altitude has very much to 'do with the value of lands for agricultural pur poses, that in a mountainous country, for instance, a few miles only apart, one section will make five cutttings of alfalfa and another only two, that corn and other warm country plants will mature nicely in one part of a county, while in others, even wheat and oats are liable to be frosted "at both ends." All these things which have little bearing in 'a generally level section like Illinois and Iowa, may mean ruin or success in Montana or Washing ton. Those born and raised in Colorado, Oregon or the states named need no prompting upon these vital local con ditions; but uninformed people com ing from the east are very liable to be misled. We believe more attention should be given these matters when writing of, or "writing up," the reg ions to the west of us. Just now many of our people are giving less attention to the treeless, hill-less plains of Canada and are carefully looking into the merits and demerits of the hill lands to the west of us. We are glad to note this, and still even in these parts, we know the greatest care should be exercised or grave and even ruinous mistake can be made. Many inquiries are reaching us about the merits of Judith Basin and similar locations. We would refer all of these to Mr. Hughes' letter in the Nov. 1st issue on dry subsoils; also to Prof. Shaw's letter in same is sue on Dry Farming in the western Dakotas, and particularly to Buttetin No. 5, of the Trans-Missouri Dry Farming Congress, address Chairman M. H. Harting, Cheyenne, Wyoming, from which we take the following: "One, of the dry farming districts now being developed in the state of Montana is known as the Judith Ba sin, in the central part of the state just east of the Rocky mountains. Tt is a level plain or bench at an eleva tion of 5,000 feet, pearly enclosed by the outlying spurs of the Rocky moun tains; the Moccasin and Judith moun tains on the northeast, Big Snowy mountains on the southeast and Little Belt and Baldy mountains on the south and west. The basin is entered from the south at Judith Gap and rapidly widens to an extreme width of forty miles east and west. The land is good to and beyond the Missouri river, but the operative farming district, the Judith Basin proper, is 'only about sixty miles in length. The area of ag ricultural land includes thirty town ships, or about 1,000 square miles, drained by the Judith river. Latitude MAY BE FREIGHT WAR VERY S00N EASTERN TRUNK LINES GRIEATLY CONCERNED OVER C. P. LINE. NEW YORK, Dec. 17.-The vice presidents and general manageis of the Eastern trunk lines today met and discussed the proposed advance in freight rates. Two sub-committees were appointed to seek a solution of the difficulties in the way of the in crease, such as the objection of the shippers and the disagreements among the railroads as to the amount of the proposed advance. It is not regarded as probable that the proposed new tariffs will be decided before January 1. The extension of the Canadian Paci fic dispatch "All rail" fast freightrline to New York City 'by way of the New York, New Haven and Hartford rail road has been taken up by the trunk line association. The chairman of the association said it was a matter de manding immediate attention and that the roads interested would probably try to make the New York, New Haven and Hartford see the error of it by the use of moral suasion. He declared positively that there would be no rate cutting war because of the invasion of the trunk line territory by the Cana dian company. 

MONTREAL, Que., Dec. 17.--G. M. Bosworth, head of the tarffic depart ment of the Canadian Pacific railroad, made the following statement tonight in regard to the report sent out that the trunk line railroads are contem plating a freight rate war on account of the action of the Canadian Pacific dispatch line in reducing rates: "The present rates of the Canadian Pacific line were established last May and have been In- effect mince then. wlt)out any protests. They were con sidered fair by the comlpanles a580 elated with us in the Canadian Pal and altitude make this a region of short seasons and extremes of tem perature between day and night, but the Ohinook winds from the mountains make the winter climate fully as agreeable as, that of the prairies of the middle West. "The:' total annual precipitation ranges from 1.4 to 20 inches, according to the proximity of the mountains. The greater part ;of precipitation falls dur ing April, May and June-the growing months. The summer and fall are usually quite dri. Soil is waxy, stocky clay, mixed with more or less coarse gravel. Predominating color of soil when dry is dark and when wet is black. It does not cake on drying, but crumbles easily, making it possible to maintain an operative farm in good physical condition. "At the experimental' sub-station farm the soil is from three to four feet thick, underlaid with gravel mix ed with clay. In most localities 'at a depth of 20 feet or more a cement is formed which produces a ýolid rock foundation.' Domestic water is pro cured from wells, the water supply ap parently coming from the surrounding mountains. Artesian wells are ob tained by drilling to a depth of about 2,000 feet. Buffalo .grass, grama grasses and stipa form the natural sod. "Most of the settlers are coming from Montana or other western states and are well equipped to meet the conditions existing. They are operat ing entirely under so-called "dry farm ing." They crop the ground every other year, working the seed bed down very fine and mellow. on the surface, sow thin, and depend largely on win ter wheat. According to reports sub mitted by experts they are making some mistakes, such as Shallow plow ing,' and planking the surface after seeding, thus leaving .the surface smooth and solid insead of loose. Both these errors. are seriouq as is shown by comparative' results between deep plowed and well harrowed fields and fields where careless work has 'been accomplished. "Some of the Judith Basin farmers allow the summner-fallow to lie in stub ble instead of plowing and cultivating. Reports show that late seeding of spring grains is another, error. In spite of these criticisms, the farming in the Judith Basin 'is, in the opinion of experts, much better than in most farming sections of the country. One legitimate excuse for poor farming in the Basin is a lack or teams and help at the proper season: The Judith farm ers are utilizing small acreage and en deavorfng, so far at'. they. have been educated to do so, to use semi-inten sive methods. "Latitude, . altitude and consequent short seasons, limit the crops largely to small grains, a hardy strain of the Turkey Red being found to survive the winters with' little'or no loss, mak in i~ts growth during the wettest por tion of the ydar, and ripening suffi ciently early to escape frost. Spring grains are, sometimes injured by early frosts, especially when late varieties are' seeded late, Spring wheat, oats and barley are grown successfully, but 'wniter wheat is the stable."-Dokata Farmer. fic dispatch line and we know of no reason why they should be opposed now. We are willing, however, to meet the representatives of the pro testing lines and discuss the issues."
