N on* of the shortest messages ever sent to congress President Wilson urges that early action be taken to complete his pro gram of "settlement and. regulation" recommended at the last session. The message In full Is as follows: Gentlemen of "the Congress: In fulfilling at this time tho duty laid upon me by the constitution of communicating to you from time to time Information of the state of the Union and recommending to your con sideration such legislative measures as may be Judged necessary and expedi ent I shall continue the practice, which I hope has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of the several heads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service and confine my self to those matters of more general public policy with which It seems use eesary and feasible to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which you will necessarily act at this session and shall mske my sug gestions as few as possible. But there were some, things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and wblch It seems necessary In the Interest of the public to do at once. The Railroad Problem. porstlvely necessary possible consideration and action onld be accorded the remaining sasures of the prograih of settlemobt and regulation which I had nocsslon to recommend to you at the close of your last session In view of the public dan gers disclosed by the unaccommodated dlfllcultlee which then existed and which still unhappily continue to ex ist betweon the railroads of the conn try and their locomotive engineers, conductors and trainmen I then recommended: First, Immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganlsatlon of the Interstate «'mmerce commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the house of representatives mid now awaiting action by the senate in order that thf commission may he enabled to dsal with the many great and various du ties now devolving upon it with a promptness and thoroirbluiexs which :ire. with Its present constitution and means of action. prnHb'nlly impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight hour day as the legul basis alike of work and of wages in the employment of all railway eui|»lo.v«»e» who are ae tuirtly engaged In the work of operat ing trains In Interstate transportation. Third, the authorization of the ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe tlie actual re sults In experience of the adoption of the*eight hour day in railway transpor tation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the In terstate commerce commission of sn increase, of freight rates to tueet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by the adoption of the eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the increase. Fifth, an 'amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, concllintion and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case rlie methods of accommodation now provided for should fail, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall bp instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. Control by the Executive. And, sixth, the lodgment in the Hands of the executive of the power, iu case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railways of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate tliem for military purposes, with authority to draft Into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials as the circumstances require for their safe and efficient use. The second and third "of these rec ommendations the congress immediate ly acted on: It established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work and wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of a commis sion to observe and report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most immediately needed, but it postponed action upon the other sug gestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate consider ation of them. 

OPERATION OP RAILWAYS •HALL NOT BE STOPPKD Te pass a law which ferbade or prevented the Individual work man te leave hie work before re solving the approval of eoeiety in doing so would be te adopt a new principle Into our jurispru dence whloh I take It for grant ed we are net prepared te Intro duce. But the propoeal that the operation of the railways of the country sht!! not flopped sr Interrupted by the eMIMrtoi! So tlon of organised bodies or men until publlo inveetlgatien shall have been inetituted 'whloh ehall make the whole gueetlen et is sue plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation ie net te prepeee any eueh principle. It le baeiri upon the very different principle that the concerted ee« tlon of powerful bodice of men ehell not be permitted te etep the induetrlal preceesee of the na tion. or of the Interstate commerce commis sion to grant an Increase of rates on the ground referred to Is Indisputably clear, and a recommendation hy the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw In question the eoope of the commission's authority or Its Inclination to do Justice when there Is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the Increase In the Interstate commerce commis sion's memltership and in Its facilities for performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of Industrial disputes, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary In time of war or other like public necessity—1 now very earnestly renew. New Legislation Neoeesery. The necessity for such legislation la manifest and presHlng. Those who have In the flnt place. It seems to me las-1 .... "'"A~ that the earliest I ,ntru"ted as with, tho responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them In such matters would find it hard, I believe..'to excuse a failure to act upon thsso grave matt«rs or any unnecessary postponement of action. Not only does ths Interstate com merce commission now find It practical ly Impossible, with Its present .member ship and organisation, to perform Its great functtons promptly and thorough ly. but It Is not unlikely that it may presently he found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must flrst he perfected as an administrative Instrument. The country cannot and should not consent to remalp any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for Jack of additional means of arbi tration and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt aa to the power of the execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted ude of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they sre needed and whenever they are needed. This Is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in (he mere statement of it. Willi regard t« one of Its items^ the increase itt (be efficiency of the interstate commerce commission, the house of representatives has al ready acted. Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. Te Safeguard Industrial Processes. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion'*should 1 make It, that any mail in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or pre vented the individual workman to leave his work before receiving Whc approval of society in doing so would be to adopt a uew principle into our Juris prudence which I* take it for granted we are not prepared tov introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopjted or interrupted by the concert ed action of organized bodies of men until a public investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue .plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle -that the concerted action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial pro cesses of tlie nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportu nity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between employee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to consider all practi cable means of conciliation or arbitra tion. I can see nothing in that proposition but the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust In it unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous re- all concerned as well as for the per- manent interests of society itself. Three matters of capital importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives—the bill which seeks to extenp greater freedom of Thursday.

We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution. It. is deem ed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale un der onr present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis o? undoubted law for It which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. Xhe thing must be done now. because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesi tate delay. T'-- argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Porto liico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily remove. We do not doubt what we wish to do in any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. Legislative Annals Enriched. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stag* of oonferencc be tween the two houses of which it is not necessary that I should speak.
