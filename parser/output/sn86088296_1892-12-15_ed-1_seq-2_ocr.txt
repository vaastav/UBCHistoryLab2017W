COUNTY ROADS AND BRIDGES. It Is to be hoped there will be no more Interruptions to the completion of the Bouldin bridge and that its construction will be hurried up to a finish before some other disgruntled citizen will attempt to catch on it a fly lDiunction. If it rained "manna and quail" in this country some one who had manna and quail at home wouia try to sret out an injunction against it This is not the spirit of enterprise that should animate our people, nor does it exhibit any disposition to unite as one man on city and county Im provementf, but it does exhibit a spirit that will retard all pub- lie enterprise. The county and city of Austin are so identical in interest in many things that there ought to be a zealous co-operation In effecting facilities for the common rood of both. Tiie farmers of the county need good roads over which to haul their corn, hay, oats, wheat and cotton to market, and Austin is their natural and most convenient place for marketing their products. The mer chants of Austin ought to be just as anxious and just as much interested in having good roads to Austin from every point of the compass in the county. They want to exchange their goods for the products of the farmer either by the purchase of the farmer's products with money or the direct exchange, which amounts to the same thing, and this very fact ought to bring about a ready and active co-operation. This miserable Idea that seems to be cultivated by some men of a preju dice of the countryman against the town and the prejudice of the town people against the country people is a mean and selfish thing that ought to be frowned down by both. The people of Austin, if they consult their own interest, will aid in furnishing all the facilities, in the way of bridges and good roads to the people of Travis county in order to make it to their in terest to deal with this, their county "town. Austin certainly offers a better market for all kinds of country pro duce than the little country stores, for these stores after obtaining the produce of the farmers bring lr to Austin to sell. If the produce was always brought directly to Austin, the farmer would save the per cent on the sales to at least one middleman and the Austin merchant can afford to pay a better price directly to tbe farmer for he has to pay it to the couDtry store keeper. Bents are not high in Austin and there is a great deal of competition and it is natural that the country peo ple can obtain better bargains by dealing direotly with the Austin mer chant. All these things taken into consid eration will show both the farmer and the Austin merchant the many ties that bind them in a common interest and there ought not to be any hag gling and injunctions about roads and bridges as between the two. A recog nition of an Interest identical is a bond of union and co-operation that ought to animate the town and the countryman to but one thing, and that Is a rivalry as to which could do most for the common good and pros perity. The fact is, a county improvement association of citizens of the city and country ought to be maintained, to be composed of the enterprising citizens, with Its committee to inaugurate needed improvements and to influence the county commissioners and the citizens to engage in these improve ments, a committee understanding the obligations of the commissioners and with a business character that . would give weight to all projects initi ated by the committee to induce citi zens ot both town and country and the commissioners to immediately carry out its suggestions. By all means let us quit this carping injunc tion policy and go forward with all needed improvements. The Waco News says the Austin Statesman seems to be sailing with out chart, compass or rudd-er. The man who says that has not sense enough to know what a chart, com pass or rudder is, on the other hand the Galveston News takes The Statesman as an illustration of a newspaper too fixed in certain party tradations to properly appreciate the mutability of governmental policy the criticism of the GalveBton News may be just for The Statesman ad mits it is controlled very much by a set of fixed principles that have been endorsed by such men as Jefferson, Tilden and Cleveland. If tbe Waco News will read and try to understand the editorials of The Statesman It may be enabled to give a little weight to its own editorial columns, but it is impossible to give the Waco News the ability to understand fixed principles. But we will not ask The News to leave home for style and strength. It might learn from its contemporary The Day. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The resident's message to congress rffHnlava a trood deal of ingenuity in some respects, but, considered as a whole, the arsrament is not susi tinea and furnishes a practical illustration of the defense of a bad cause. While apparently the message re gards the interest of the country above partisan consideration, it is in fun an Intensely partisan that it re fuses to recogniae the expressed will nf t'n neoDle. in that it advises the present congress to let the tariff severely alone. In other woras me president refuses to permit a congress over which he has control, hv reason of the Republlca majority in the senate, to obey the will of the people and inaugurate a tariff reform and especially when he admits that to be the meaning of the late election, does this manifest nartv zeal defiant of publio opinion. The president congratulates the oountryupon its general prosperity r.ri ita innranoAd nroduction. and 

(BJUIA 4 IV W u vat f r mentions with statistics every depart ment of industry except the farmer The low price of cotton and wheat he considers as "one of the unfortunate incidents of agriculture." For all the lnorease in production, wealth and DrosDerltv he gives credit to tne pro tective tariff. He does not consider the development ot the natural re sources of the country and its unpar alleled growth, but "the unlavorable Incidents of agriculture" that having no protection and paying a large share of its earnings to pro tected industries accounts to some ex tent for the prosperity of protected interests and Its own unfavorable con dition. The president evidently desires to leave the Impression on the country that the Eepublican party has done Its work faithfully and wisely, and calls attention in advance to what he hopes will be the contrast under a Democratic administration with a different policy. And yet the im portant thing that he emphasizes with statistics and says Is "Intolerable and disgraceful" is the result of in action or inability on the part of the Republican party to correct in its long lease of power since the civil war. The president says "Ever since our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebel cruisers during the war of the rebellion, the United states has been paying an enormous annual tribute to foreign countries . in the shape of freight and passage moneys." Will the Eepublicans never forget that the war is over and that they have been in power nearly thirty-five years? Eebel cruisers, forsooth? It Is "disgraceful and intolerable," but the Eepublican party, with full means and opportunity to correct it, has per mitted our vast carrying trade to be monopolized by foreign bottoms, sail ing under foreign flags. They have permitted our merchant nnnue to be drivt-n from the high t.v n-, rot by rebel cruisers, but by unjust shipping laws operating directly in favor of foreign vessels. A mer chant marine that whitened every port of commerce with its sails and proudly floated the American flag, has boen driven from the seas by the inaction and incompetency of the Ee publican party, and the president may well characterize it as "intoler able and disgraceful." The president in his conclusion again manifests his partisan bias. He Bays "the growth and prosperity of this country will give us a level to note the increase or decrease that new legislative policies may bring to us." The president evidently expects and desires a "decrease" under Democratic policy, but he will be mistaken. a At the close of Mr. Cleveland's term he will be enabled to congratulate the country on the agricultural prosperity as well as of those, indus tries that have heretofore been protected. He will not like Mr. Harrison be compelled to speak of "one of the unfavorable incidents of agriculture" lor the policy will equally favor all industries, and not burden agriculture with the pay ment of a bonus to manufacturers. The message is meant to give great glory to tbe Eepublican party and convince the country that that party has left a splendid legacy to the Dem ocratic administration, with a de fiance to that administration to keep up the gait of that prosperity. The president forgets to tell us of an enor mous debt his party has saddled upon the country and the embarrassments that will at once confront the Demo crats in administrating upon such an estate as that left by the party going out of power. THE 

ANTI-OPTION BILL. It is quite apparent that the anti option bill will never become a law. A substitute has been offered in the senate, and if that passes, when it goes back to the house it will be decently Interred in the pigeon hole of a desk in some committee room. A great reaction of opinion on this subject has taken place since the last session of congress. Many farmers who favored it then are convinced that it is prejudicial to their Interest, and have petitioned con gress to defeat the measure. The only men whom the bill would benefit are the cotton buyers, bat lsit hardly fair to sacrifice a general inter eBt to their convenience, as they are ail making money rapidly now In the face of the future purchasers. i Measures have been tasen to Kill the bill when it comes back to the house of representatives, and it would be a waste of time and space to dis cuss it now. USE OF CONVICT LABOR. Missouri is about to eliminate the impediments of state convict competi tion by using the convicts for build ing macadamized roads in each town ship. The governor elect has given some attention to the subject and says that two macadamized roads fourteen feet wide and traversing the township from north to south and from east to west, just twelve miles long each, could be built with convict labor for $20O,C00. It is a good idea but we are quite certain our county judge and commissioners could teachhim'an eco nomic lesson on the cost of these roads. MisBouri has the advantage of a more superior political division than we have, square townships, that would simplify the work. Notwithstanding that Texas could very easily establish by survey these roads, and especially In this tier of counties where we have so much of the best stone for the pur pose, build very inexpensively. The greatest cost would be the tianaporta tion, and that would be at a minimum in Travis and adjoining counties. Goods roads are very important Why can't some of our enterprising citizens take hold of this thing and work it up into success by urging it upon the next legislature? SENATE CAUCUS. Tbe leading Democrats in the Sen ate are moving cautiously. In caucus they have determined not to attempt the reorganization of the Senate in the name of the Democratic party unless they can muster a clear caucus ma jority with assured power to control legislation in that body, and for this purpose they must have forty-five members pledged to the action oi the caucus. Senator Peffer has signified his willingness to co-operate with the Democrats, but the caucus has wisely determined to take no risks and there must be a complete submis sion to caucus dictation by every mem ber entering the caucus with no com-. promises or half measures. There is some disappointment in the complexion of several of the legis latures of the Western states where the People's party united in a canvass with the Democrats. They were pledged to return Democratic senators and now trre at tempting after receiving the goods, to wiggle out of the contract. Unless these misunderstandings are adjusted there is no certainty that there will be forty-five Democratic senators in the next congress, and without the full power to control both branches of congress it would be fritile to attempt to inaugurate radical changes in the revenue laws of the country. PROSCRIPTION. According to a correspondent of the Dallas News, the citizens of Terrell are very much excited and very indig nant over the discharge of several offi cials of the lunatic asylum at that place on account ot their independent aotion in voting for Judge Clark. Dr. Preston was interviewed by the re porter and admitted tbe men were discharged on account of "offensive partisanship," a very convenient phrase, but it is fair to Dr. Preston to say that he olalms there were other reasons, which he declined to give. It is quite evident from the report that partisan feeling was very much at the bottom of the whole thing. This is unfortunate for Texas. Some men don't seem to know when a fight is over. This is a poor way to pacify the conflicting elements oi the Democratic party in Texas. Indisoreet and vio lent partisans do away with much of the good accomplished by conserva tive and juBt men. Dr. Preston is well known in this city and has been thought very highly of by this people. It was not supposed that he would permit the violence of partisanship to run away with his judgment so far as to use his official position to deprive men of a living on account of their exercising their free and un trameled privilege of voting aocording to their independent belief and opin ion. This is a style of proscription that tends to enslave freemen and the man or men who indulge in it are doing violence to a bed rock rooted sense of justice. Talk about the license of the press. Some of the preachers In New York seem to have no respect for any thing under any cirenmstances. While Jay Gould's children were grieving over the dead body ot a kind father, and while his remains were lying in his residence on Fifth avenue, a number of the preachers last Sunday took him as a text and abused him in the strong est language. The Eev. Lyman Abbott compared him to Robin Hood, and said he was a thief of thai olaiB. Oihe.t were equally plain I'm their use of his life as a publio roboor, and one of them complained that his eon grcgation had experienced but little of his charity. This, to say the least, was very bad taste, and certainly must have been offensive to a number of their hearers who had been bene fitted by his Mndnesa. Especially waB it rude and unfeeling towards his children. They ought to have been permitted to mourn over his remains undisturbed by such epithets at least until their father was decently in terred. EDUCATIONAL TRAINING. Imperfect and Incomplete edncation is the rule rather than the exception As a general thiBg students do not know how to study and therefore ever learn. ThiB is because the teacher doeB not know how to teach. The most important capacity of a pu pil Is rarely brought into aetion until the mature man discovers it for him self. A certain curriculum of text-books is put into the hands of the student and he or she is informed that so many lines, verses or ehapters are to be studied for each recitation and if anything difficult is encountered the teacher thinks he has done his whole duty when he explains it to his class The very Alpha of un education is eg letted and never alluded to by the edaeator, and that is, the ability to control all the capacities of the mind by the will. Quite the reverse is often taight, especially if the student is ad vaneed to the study of a science or a profession. Young men studying law are often told by their preueptors that it is useless to attempt to understand the author and fix the principles he teaches on tbe mind, unless the stu dent is in a humor to study, unless the mind works with ease and without any exertion to concentrate it upon the sobjeet. This very thing has brought mere incompetent men to the bar than any lack of natural ability. The very first lesson to be taught a student is the ability of anyone with a mind to control that mind by the will. A man has no Idea of his own apacity mntil he learns this lesson. The mind ean be controlled by the will with as much ease as a locomo tive engineer can control his engine. In faet, all the powers of the mind are never brought into action until it is touched by the spur of compulsion, and when a student has learned the power of his will over every faculty of the mind, then and then only, is he fully equipped for mental effort. The mind, like the body, is lazy and will never do good work until its master, the will, takea control and forces it to action at ail times and under all cir enmstances. The difference in men is not so much in their mentality, but in the understanding by some men of their ability to use every capacity of the mind to the very best advantage. The mind is very much like a piece of ma chinery; It needs the pressure of steam to do its work. The will of man is the steam that puts the mind in motion and forces it into continued action until the work is accomplished. The will ean reach every power ot the mind by direct action. We often find it impossible to remember tbe name of some one and think we have exhausted our efforts to recall it, and go about other things, but the mind has been put into activity and motion by the will and to our surprise, with out the slightest consciousness on our part, the name suddenly pops up as it were, with as familiar a sound to us as our awn name. This demonstrates the power of the will ever tbe mind and shows ns that the mind put in motion by the will works on without our knowledge of its continued working on a subject that we think for a time it has aban doned. The great fault of our educators is In net teaching such facts as these to thestadent early in life. The first thing to be taught is how to think and how to think well, bow to me all the natural capacities of the mind to the best advantage, and then the pro cess ( education is easy, the mind runs like well oiled machinery and does all its work well. It has been remarked by some able writer that the lack of the power of o-ordination made a great many feels bat sometimes a genius. When tbe Mind is governed at pleasur bey the will, co-ordination of mental ca pacity is so natural that it seems in digenous and each faculty is mustered into place, and like an army with banners is ready for diversified or concentrated aotion. There is a good deal of wranging over the New York senatorship. The machine wants Edward Murphy Jr., to become the associate United States senator with Senator David B. Hill, but the friends of Mr. Cleveland op pose Murphy on the ground that the president ought to have the advice and co-operation of the senators from his own state. Mr. Cleveland him self has expressed a very decided op position to Murphy. He came in con flict with the machine during his can didacy and the machine had to yield. He is large enough now to smash it. Mr. Cleveland's friends want either Whitney or Condent, claiming that that the city of New York is entitled to one Senator. 

MONETARY CONFERENCE, NOTHING TANGIBLE EA8 YET BEEN BROUGHT FORTH. One of the Belgian Delegates Suggests a Silver Purchase Flan Professor An drews of America Makes a Log ical Appeal for Harmony. Brussels, Deo. 8. When the Inter national Monetary conference adjourns at the end of next week it will proba bly leave the respective governments represented to decide whether or not It shall reassemble in January. Amer lean and other bl-melalio delegates will try to obtain from the conference a recommendation to all governments to allow from a year to eighteen months to elap-e before taking any active measures towards changing the present currency policy. The advo cates of this recent action have in view a possible improvement to the general monetary position. They also hope much from the growth of bi-metalisra as a political force in British politics. Immediately after opening today M. Allard, one ot the Belgian dem gates, submitted a plan for an inter national agreement for the purchase under common account of stocks of silver against which treasury notes will be issued by contracting states, none of which will be obliged to coin into silver thus purchased or modify its existing currency legislation. The plan proposes that these notes shall have an international circulation. M. llaflalovitch, one of the Russian delegates, spoke briefly re garding the Morltz Levi plan. He declared he did not believe under present conditions any international agreement to regulate relations be tween gold and saver was possible. The general discussion was then re sumed. In reply to an invitation ex tended him by the conference. Profes sor Andrews, an American delegate. made an address in which he said he hoped the idea that America was bent only upon Increasing her national wealth and merely acting as a service creature of mine owners would be for ever dismissed as being equally as absurd as the idea that American in terest was mainly due to distress af- meting tne American monetary sys tern. Continuing, Professor Andrews Baiu: "We have not and are not at preB' ent likely to have a dollar in silver be yond our needs in the United States We have no idea of soliciting any favor from the people of Europe. What we desire is as much to Europe's interests as ours. We wish to multi ply our trade with the world, to do a vaster business with China and Japan and Central and South America, and at the same time with Eurooe. This will never be sua cessfully accomplished so long as two. groupes of nations continue to drilt apart. I he evils of a fluctuating ex change which will be sent to England in her commerce with India we also experience in our trading with our newest neighbors, but we are determ ined not to accomplish this desirable end at the terrible cost of opening a similar chasm between ourselves and the nations of Europe. We will part company with Asia and South Amer ica ratner than with you. We will not forever continue alone the tas-k of sustaining the price of silver. Ii Eu rope is not enough interested in the matter to co-operate with us we will soon decrease our annual purchases ofsiherand begin to provide by re cruiting our currency by issues of pa par. The next congress is nearly cer tain to open proceadure in thatdirec tion. We will not give uo our gold The time-honored monetary policy of tne united mates win never D9 changed with Mr. Cleveland's con sent." Referring to the tariff. Professor Andrews said it was obvious there was no surer way to lower the meri can tariff than for Europe and the united wtates to agree upon a ro'icy favorable to silver as money. That alone, he declared, would abate the connict ior gold ana leave the United Slates to effect a generous reduction in customs tariff. In conclusion Pro fessor Andrews said he thought some of the plans proposed to congress were feasible and it the delegates continue their deliberations with a due sense of their responsibility the conference would not fail to devise measures of relief.

WALTER SHAW'S TRIAL. After Conviction, Appeal and Revenal He Spain Faces a Jury. Spec!nl to The Statesman. Houston, Dec. 8. On March 31 last, Walter E. Shaw, a young lawyer, went home drunk and cut the throats of his mother and aunt, Mrs. Johnson, a school teacher, robbed the premises and fled to Galveston, where he was apprehended. On examining trial he wrote out a confession, plead guilty before the district court, but with drew the plea and went to trial. He was found guilty with death penalty, but took an appeal and was granted a new trial which began today. Shaw's motion for continuance was overruled. Out of a venire nf fiixr.v nn 1 T7 fail jurors were obtained, and a special veuiro ui ijw una ueen oraerea. The crime was most diabolical and when arrested Shaw asked the spectators in court to lynch him. His victims were former residents of New Orleans. FOR
