STAHDABD, T DB BDAY, Hen ptrt In the best years of their lives la the pursuit of riches. One class works with the head, and the other with the mus cles. Each cares more for dollars than for health. The brain is taxed to the utmost In evolv ing and excuting schemes, and the bodv is worn out with constant, unremitting toil. Just about the time a man 6tops to take account of things, he finds the dollars have come, but health has departed. Then he reverses matters completely. He devotes the rest of his life to spending his dollars to regain his health. What a man with worn-out body and tired brain needs most of all is a (rood stomach. Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery is the proper remedy to set the stomach right This medicine will make his appetite good, make his weak stomach 6trong and help it to digest the food he puts into it. Good digestion makes pure blood, and pure blood vitilizes the whole system. This great remedy also cures those who have sore throat, a persistent cough, weak and bleeding lungs and bronchitis, all of which often arise from weak stomach and consequent indigestion. It is a cleansing, strengthening, puriGying, invigorating al terative tonic. It puts life into the blood and nerves, into the brain and body. It cures every form of indigestion, makes the sleep sound, and nerves steady. There is nothing so good, and you should refuse all substitutes offered by dealers.
