1 E5 LICKING VALLEY COURIER. Issued Thursday by The Morgan County Publlshlna Co Terms One Dollar a year In dvence All communications should be ad dressed to the Editor. Entered as second class mattei April 7, 1910, at the post-office at Wes Liberty, Ky., under the Act of Marcr 3, 1879. H. G. COTTLE, Editor. We are authorize to announce JOHN W. COFFEE, I Morgan county, as a candidate for thi ' democratic nomination for Congress fron the Ninth Congressional district, subjec to the action 'of the democratic primary. The mail order liquor houses will reat a rich harvest for the next few weeks. Now is the season when the young men are seeking a pretext for auarrelinc with' their best girls. Santa Claus is almost as popu lar with the little fellows as Beckham is with the Kentucky democratic voters. The spirit of the mountain ed itors toward the reviving of the Mountain Press Association is encouraging, but no action is be ing taken. Brothers, don't it look as though our business methods are strongly reflected in our apathy toward this? Let's wake up and hustle! We hope that the new. county administration will catch the good roads enthusiasm that is taking hold of the other sections of the State. Morgan county only needs good roads to make her the greatest county in the mountains. Citizens, is it worth the effort. Start the agitation and keep it up until we have good roads. Notwithstanding the fact that the law requires that the finan cial statement of the county be published annually, in the last three years it has only been pub lished once, and then only a list of the claims , allowed. The meaning of the law is that such a statement shall be, published as win snow an lae revenue ae Tived from all sources and all the expenditures. A statement that will tell the public the exact condition of the business of the county the revenue received, the money paid out and the in ' debtedness of the county. THE NEXT LEGISLATURE. Meeting just after the holi days, with the evidences of the enormous amount of liquor ship- ped into Kentucky from other states fresh in mind, it ought to be an easy matter for the Gen eral Assembly to enact a law in compliance with the national law known as the Webb bill, that will prevent the shipment of liquor into dry territory.. And that such a law will be enacted there is little doubt.. The senti ment of the people is in favor of it,- and the only opposition will come from the liquor interests, It will be a time when, the peo pie will watch the votes of their senators and representatives closely in this matter, and few will dare heed the call of whisky trust. None of them want to commit political suicide. WANAMAKER AUD ADVERTIS ING, The Courier-Journal had the following editorial in a recent is sue concerning John Wanamaker, Philadelphia's Merchant Prince and former Postmaster of the Tnited States. It could be read with profit by every merchant in Kentucky and we commend it to the careful perusal of the mer chants of Morgan county: In an address delivered in Philadelphia recently John Wan amaker said the first necessity of success in retail trade is good merchandise, He added that good advertising is "quite as much of a necessity to a business that is to keep up a healthy growth." . "If you have in your shop," said Mr. Wanamaker, "exactly what 500,000 people in the city want, but only , 500 of them know you have it. the care and energy you have expended in maintaining a stock of high quality will do little good, either to your customers or to your basiness." Mr. Wanamaker may be con sidered an authority on adver tising, for there has been no more consistent and persistent adveitiserin all the history of the United States. He is one of the country's greatest mer chants. He began business on a rather meager basis, but by judicious use of the newspapers he let all Phildelphia know what he had to sell, and increased his establishment and his outlay forpublicty nntil he made the name Wanamaker known around the world. In the half a century or more that the Wanamaker store has grown from nothingness to its present proportions thousands of stores in Philadelphia have come and gone without leaving a rip ple on the city's surface. Hon est merchants, many of them, who dealt in good goods and gave their customers a square deal, but they either neglected the publicity end of the business or botched it up so badly that they they got no results. "The satisfaction of knowing that your name stands for hood mer chandise," said Mr. Wanamaker in his recent address, "is great thing certainly, Put it is not ap.t to be greatly profitable unless the public at large knows it also:" The retail merchant who does not advertise cannot hope to build up a big, growing and en during business. All merchants, it is true, cannot be Wanamak ers, but. there is no merchani who cannot enlarge his trade by intelligent advertising. it will command a monoply of the saloon advertising and ob tain a circulation among the li quor people. L. T. H, AND 

STILL THEY COME. A few days ago we received a volunminous unsigned article boosting a certain candidate for district office. It seems super fluous to repeat that we publish no unsigned articles. We have said this so often that it sounds stale, but still they come. We don't know who our anonymous eorrespondent is, but we feel sure that he is not a subscriber to the Courier or he would have known better. He subscribes himself "Democrat" at the end of his,, effusion, but then there are as many democrats in Mor gan county as there" are Smiths ki New York, and tnat signature is not sufficient to sucure publication. But then there is no great harm done our waste basket is of goodly proportions. GOT HIS QUIEUS. Sheriff Frank Kenniard last week settled with the Auditor of ublic Accounts and paid over to him the amount of Revenue due the State from Morgan county. Mr. Kenniard was the fourth sheriff in the State to meet his obligations to the State. The prompt and efficient manner in which Frank Kenniard has per formed the duties of the office has endeared him to the people, and if he ever asks for office he will be a hard man to beat, 9 THE MESSAGE. President Wilson has again demonstrated that he is a states man. His message to Congress is a brief, but forceful docu ment. It is not a preachment. It is a terse explanation of the 'situation and a statement of his views upon public questions. His recommendation of Presi dential primaries and of public ownership of . the Alaskan rail ways are regarded as extreme by some, but they only show that the President has looked in to the future further than most men do, and knows the actual needs of the country. He advo cates no change in the Mexican question, but advised a continua tion of the "watching and wait ing" policy. He is demonstrat ing that as the country becomes ready for a departure from old ways that he is ready to aid. His administration will work the greatest advancement of politi cal and economic thought in our history. NEW 

PAPER. The Kentuckian is the name of a new monthly paper at Jack son, by Ryland C. Musick, form er owner of the Times. The pa per has no local features but wil seek a Statewide recognition Mr. Musick has not yet decided that Jackson is big enough for him, and is considering the ad visability of making the office o; publication at Lexington or Louisville." it his Did ior statewide sup port is founded on his antagonism to the candidacy of Mr. Beckham as the first issue indicates, his venture will die a bornin'. An other feature is that is printed by contract away from home and the union label is conspic uously absent. To clean the Augean stables or pontics is quite a tasK, and Mr. Musick is not a Hercules, Cleaner politics is making great headway in this State by reason of the awakening of public con science, and not by the efforts o those who oppose Mr. Beckham That crowd don't want clean politics. If the lventuckian is established to become the Moses to lead the State to clean politics it has gotten into damned bad company at the very beginning of its existence. But we welcome the Ken tuckian to our table, and give it the glad . hand. It can't do much harm, It certainly can't hurt Mr, Beckham. Its editor is one of those political genuises who can always be depended up- jon to snatch defeat from vic tory, and who has never yet backed a winner. If the pacer 'continues rabidly anti-Beckham & f C 4 -C- . -ff -r. . c- r. T ........ ........ ....... Which Is Common Sense with out Educational Furbolows. By L. T. Hovermalb.

Famous Address OP Cof. John T. Ilazclrigg 

DELIVERED JULY 4, 1776 Many of our older citizens will remember hearing the justly fa mous Historical Address of the eloquent Colonel Hazelrigg, and because of the historical value of it to Morgan county we have printed and bound it and offer it for sale while they last at 3i cents a copy.

The "Spug" movement is the atest thing to call for public at tention, and it has the merit of being founded on good, hard common sense. It is an associa tion called 4he Society for the revention' of . Useless Giving, the term "Spug" being derived from the,. first letters of the words. -I don't know who start ed the movement, but whoever it was haearned a place in the :Iall of Fame. Useless, or ' rather senseles?, giving needs to be abated. Take the Christmas holiday giving for instance. Jones buys Smith and Brown and Green and Black each a costly present, neither of which he can afford and which are of no practical use, just because he feels that each of them will give him some costly present that he has no earthly use for. And be cause it is a silly custom we have not the courage to suggest that we quit it lest some of our neigh bors call us stingy.' The purpose of the Spugs is to break up this worse than silly habit. ' But the Spugs don't discourage giving if the gift will be helpful it is only the useless giving that they wish to abate. Just what rules and reglations the society has and what the of ficers are called I don't know, but the chief officer should be dubbed the "Mighty Fool Kill er," and should have a number of assistants. I ''jined" as soon as I could. Let us hope that the Spugs will, wax numerous and the giving for' mere form's sake win cease. '. ' rarents and near relatives should be as liberal in their gifts as their means will al low and the needy should not be forgotten, but- useless ' gifts to those who don't need them should be eschewed'. , vt CQurs&the young men are expected to give their sweet hearts something nice at Christ mas time, ' but even then the matrimonially inclined fellows, snch as Daniel Henry ,and Leoni das Redwine, should see that the presents should be something useful. Handsome men like my self who just can.t help having a half dozen sweethearts at a time are not expe'i-ted to give Christ mas presents as they might make a difference between them. .
