It feeds to show a great increase of our relative strength that our *enerB'.-in-Chief should feel able to con front and bold in check every active force of ihe enemy, and yet 10 detach a w»li ap poitited army to move oh such an expedi tion. Thy result tot yet being kr.owu con jecture is not here indulged. Important movements have also occurred durlrg rhe year to tbe eflect of moulding soi-iaty for durability in the Union. Although short of complete success id much in the right direction tuat 12,000 citizens of eacb of tbe States of Arkansas and Louisiana have or ganized loyal State governments, with free (*m*titutious, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer the^ni. The movement in tbe same direction'is more extensive, though less definite inMissouri, Kentucky and Tennessee and should not be overlooked: but Maryland present'* an ex ample of complete success. Maryland is secure to liberty and Union for all tbe fu ture. The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit, being driven out, it may s»?ek to tear ber, but will woo her no more. At tbe last session ol' Congress, n propos ed amendment of tbe Constitution, abol ishing slavery throughout tbe United States, passed tbe Senate, but faiie*d for lack of tbe requisite two-tbirds vote in tbe Uoufce of Representatives. Although the present, is tbe same Congress, or nearly the same members—without questioning tbe r-isdom or patriotism of tbosb wL atood hi opposition, I venture to recom mend tbe reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session." Of course th-) abstract question is not charg ed, but an intervening election has almost ma«i* ii certain tbat tha next Congress will pass tbe» measure if this does not. Hence then* :s only a question of tiu e as to when tlie proposed amendment will go to tiie State* for tbeir action, and as if is to so go at ail aI may we not chum tni.tthe events, imposed of prosperity and rapid growth.

In 4 great national crisis like ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable, almost indispensible, r.Tid approach 10 such unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the wil! of tbe iRSjority, simply because it is the will of the majority.
