This impression, conveyed by the enthusiasm of a gathering that Oiled every seat in the National Theater, was acoented by an atmosphere of listening ln tentness that obviously absorbed every note on the program?includ ing responses to insistent recalls. Music lovers, however, are not nec essarily trained musicians, and for that reason Mme. Homer is to be commended for the wisdom of a pro gram so versatile as to satisfy every phase of song-hunger, ranging from oratorio to folk songs, beginning with Beethoven and ending approxi mately with Mother Goose. Artistically good to look upon, in American beauty satin and with a red rose in her hair, the singer gave for her opening number Beethoven's "Hymn to Nature." voicing the theme with an inspirational jnelody worthy of the work that placed probably the greatest composer of the ages among the masters of song. Prom Men delssohn's "Oratorio of St. Paul" she selected "The Lord Is Mindful of His Own." in which she visioned, with In spirational melody, an aria that had the martyrdom of Stephen for Its theme. Handel's "Vo Far Guerre," from his opera of "Rlnaldo," eloped the first group, and at Its close Mme. Homer gave for encore "In the Time of Roses." Following a second group, in which the singer received individual recognition for her numbers from Victor Masse, a number from "Resplghi" and a beauti fully melodious rendition of "In Questa Flera," from "La Glooonda," adapted by PonchleiU from Victor Hugo's "Angelo." Mme. Homer received, possibly, her | greatest ovation for Sydney Homer's set ting of Joaquin Miller's scathing rebuke i "To Russia." which she gave with dra matic tensity. It was greeted by an Instant's silence, followed by a storm of I applause. The remainder of the program con sisted of Homer's "Sheep and "Lambs" and "Mother Goose," which were given ] with the charm of sentiment and joyous fun that captivated, in turn. Folksongs f{om the Hungarian. Latvian and Slo vakian followed, and nothing too fine could be said of the wisps of sadness that threaded the deep-throated melody of "The-Falling Star" or the singing quality of "Lullaby.'" which carried in each note the tenderness of a young mother who sings to a baby that some how understands. To speak of the glorious quality of Mme. Homer's contralto voice would be telling concertgoers what they already know, but one cannot resist mention of the clear enunciation which gives a story-telling Interest to her work. It is not a usual gift. Also, if permissible, the might like to know that following the concert, many women in the lobby paid tribute to the exquisite artistry of a toilet so beautifully remindful of a day when it was customary to wear clothes.

Surplus Medical Supplies of Army May Be Used to Help. The War Department 'will be au thorized by Congress, it wag Indicated Thursday, to turn , over to the Am - - lean Relief Administration its sur plus medical supplies for use In the famine districts of Russia. Members of the House military com mittee have agreed to report favor ably a resolution authorizing the transfer of supplies, and it is expect ed that the committee will formally report the measure tomorrow ai a substitute for a bill passed early In the week by the Senate. The pro visions of the two proposals are simi lar except that the House measure carries a stipulation that the cost value of the supplies donated for re lief work shall not exceed $4,000,000. No move has as yet been made in the House toward authorizing; an ap propriation for food for starving Russians, as recommended by Presi dent Harding in his message to Con gress. The President urged that funds for the purchase of 10,000,000 bushels of corn and 1,000.000 bushels of seed grain should be made available for distribution In Russia.
