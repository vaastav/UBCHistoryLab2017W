We are glad to see the learned professors and leading daily papers falling into line with the idea expressed by the r.Nio.v Timks nearly a year ago. The Supreme Court of the Cnited States litis at last handed down a - - n... decision ha xo in'-' liiu.'iin* >-?i u" State of South Carolina to the Federal government for revenue license tax for the Kile of liquor in the disp< usuries. The State having to ]>;iv revenue license for the sale of liquor in the dispensaries should h ive the effect to put the State out of the liquor business. The court says the State of South Carolina is^ engaged in the Kile, of liquor for profit and gain and should pay the revenue tax. Iter haps the most stubbornly fought measure that will come before the national congress at its present session will he the proposed bill recommended by President Roosevelt giving enlarged and increased power to railroad commission under the provisions of the interstate commerce law. To give the commission the power to fix freight rates would mean much to railroad companies and the measure is being bitterly fought by the railroad companies throughout the I 'nit?d States. The distribution of literature on the subject has aroused the opposition of the railway labor population, as they say should the rate he reduced and become uniform, it would eventually and inevitably result in a reduction of their wages. 

HOGS IN THE CITY. Has the ordinance which prohibits the raising and keeping ol hogs within the corporate limits been repealed? If so we would like to know it. The reason we ask the question is because we have been reliably informed that there has lx:en and is now tilty or more hogwithin the corporate limits in pens of different sizes. That many of these hogs have been kept through he entire year, and that the person whose business it is to see that no hogs are kept in town has known trial these hogs were Kepi in town ami nothing lias l>een said or <1<>n?: aliout it. If one person can keep and raise hogs in town, everybody else has the same right, anil in view of the faet that some have been allowed t<? do it, others who may do the same could not be prosecuted for it. Some time ago we suggested that the city council amend the hog law so as to make it possible to raise hogs without being objectionable to ncigiil>ors and not detrimental to health, that is to have certain size lots in which the hogs can be kept. This is a question of much importance, as tho raising of a li'tf means the saving of money to aonit> people. HELP YOUR NEWSPAPER.

NEWSPAPERS AS TEXT BOOKS In several editorials on school work during the past year we have a Ivocated the use of newspapers in the schools, as we regard the newspaper as the latest edition of tin.' history of the world, an up-to-date recital of current events with which the scholars of every school should be familiar. The newspaper as an educator ranks high with the modern text books as it contains matter found nowhere else and is therefore at this advanced age of new ideas and general knowledge almost indispensable in the education of people and pupils. More and la tter knowledge of the West India islands was obtained through the newspapers during and since the SpanishAmerican war than was ever known before. The capture of the Phillipine Islands was a revelation to the most profound student of geography in America. The Russo-Japanese war through the newspaper has taught the |>eople not only of the United States but of the world more than they ever knew before, not only of the geography of the far east, but of the character, habits, customs, laws, resources and developments of a people of whom we knew but little, and apparently eared less. In the wnoic course 01 a emiers scnooi me it would not have learned in any l?ook or from any teaehcr the tilings t<?ld in the newspapers during the periods we have mentioned nhove, and we venture the assertion that no future history written of the. above mentioned events will contain half so correct an account as was contained in the newspaper accounts. The Portsmouth Peace Conference between the Russian and : i Japanese embassadors will find 110 | place in history, yet it was fully | rejKirtcd in the newspaper. No such conference was ever held before in the civilized world. Yet there was never such a conference of such v.ir-t interest and importance to the world as large as that was, because it settled questions that 110 conflict of arms could determine. Although we advocated the use of newspapers we have heard of no adoption of our suggestion by school or college. Perhaps the reason of this is that it came from a weekly newspaper, edited by :iii unkown editor, but we are gratified to know that our ideas of the uso of the newHpnper in schools have hceii sustained hy a learned professor in a leading I'niversity as will appear in the following clipped from a New York paper: NKWSI'AI'F.US AS A COI.LHGK STl'DY. Newspapers have heen put alongside, the text hooks at Northwestern I'nivcrsity, and hereafter students in the American history class must eonie to the recitation room prepared to answer questions on the news of the day. The new study grew out of a discovery made hy the professor in the course of one of his lectures. He referred to an article on Russian matters, which had appeared in a morning paper. Upon questioning a njemhor of the class, be found that the student knew little of current news, and other members 6{ the class wire as l ignorant. Thin Bet the professor to thinking. He told the stud?nb that newspapers were the latest edi tion of current history, and h? should expect every man t<> rea< up. THANKSGIVING AT JONESVILLt Telephone Thinks 15 Cent Cotton too High. Jonesviile to have a Telephone System. Fight on the Street. Other Local News of Interest. .Ionksmllk, Dee. 4th.?A good ! rain Saturday night followed by a freeze and tine winter weather which brings sausage and spare ribs. Thanksgiving was generally observed in our town last Thursday I i * i t ? ? ? ami uic nay was quiet ami orderly. Rev. P. K. Cnmak preached at his church hero last night ton lar^e and attentive congregation, lie will preach his last sermon for t'ds conference year next Sunday. Mr. Caniak's work has been very acceptable to his church here this year and he will he acceptable for the next year and he will no doubt be returned as he will carry a good re' port up to the annual conference at j Spartanburg next week. I understand Home farmers in the country are criticising me for what I wrote in the columns oi Tiic Timks in regard to the prio the cotton growers association put upon the cotton when they moved the price from 11 to 15 cents. 1 wish to say in these same columns that I meant no harm to any farm !or or farmers organization for 1 was I born and raised on a farm and hav? always been a sort of a farmer, and ! I know the soil supports everything jand from Mother Earth we all com and to her we must all return, and j to the tillers of the soil I have the greatest respect and am much interi ested and for that very reason 1 j wrote what I did, and this is my | position still. If cotton goes up to 15 cents, most, if not all of the necessaries of life will go up in pro| portion to the advance in cotton and the farmers, (and they are in |the majority, too,) that have sold i their cotton up to 11 cents, the price once fixed by the association, will be forced to pay these advanced j prices, and will be hurt by it, fo I : am talking in the interest of the majority of the farmers as I understand it, and those who were not able to hold their cotton but must sell it to pay their debts. The cotton season is nearly over and it is too late now to raise the price after i so many have sold at the price the {association fixed. I am not alone in my views about this matter, for 11 have had a number of farmers to ! tell mo that they agree with me and some of them belong to the cotton growers association. | I)r. W. 0. Southard, Mrs. South lard, and their daughter, Miss I Mary, will go to Jersey City this week to attend the wedding of a relative of Dr. Southard's. The doctor will then go over to New York and spend several days in the further study of medical science. Messrs. W. W. Wood and A. J.

The Bell Telephone | Company will put in a central office i in the former office of Dr. II. T. II la tnes and Miss Kittie Alman, daughter of Mr. Ezra Alman, will be the hello girl. Most of the fixtures for the office are now here and as soon as the balance arrives the system will be installed. The entertainment at the graded school house last Friday night was a success. Some fifty dollars was realized, which will be used for a Christinas tree for the school. The corpse of Ix?uis Jeter, who was killed at Moore's Station at a i hot supper Thursday night of last ' week was brought here on the train Saturday night and buried in the country yesterday. Louis was the sou of Ci Jeter, a good old colored man that lives here. A negro who is charged with the killing is in jail i at Spartanburg with two bullet holes in his body. Our Mayor, J. W.

J. Mosely, of Switzer, is in our town and says he is going to move hack to Jonesvillc. Telephone. Jonesville and Union Cotton Market. In justice to all parties concerned we cheerfully make the following statement in explanation to what we said in The Times last week aliout Jonesville buyers paying 10 3-4 for cotton and selling to Union buyers for 11 1-1. it seems that we were mistaken when we stated the case as above. We. should have said that a Jonesville buyer was paying 10 3-4 and had offered to sell a Union buyer at 11 1-4. ! This is what the Union buyer says no Baui 10 us, so we made tirst mistake. The Union buyer was mistaken in what the Jonesville buyer had said, as the Joncsvillc buyer ! says now tiiat he said cotton was bringing all the way from 10 11-4 to 11 1-4 according to grade. However the Jonesville buyer did offer a lot of 12 bales which were then at Lock hart Junction to the Union buyer f ir 111-4 as we understand both buyers, but the U nion buyer did not purchase the above mentioned 12 bales or any cotton at all from Jonesville buyer. Wo hope this will prove satisfactory as we had no intention to do anyone an injustice, neither Jonesville or the cotton buyers as our previous mention of the fact that Jonesville -I ? iau bUIUVlll Uiiys prior lO 1/1118 paid more for cotton than Union had been paying according to the best information we could get.
