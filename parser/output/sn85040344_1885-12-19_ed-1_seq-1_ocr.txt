SUPERIOR. WISCONSIN. SATURDAY, DECEMBER lit. 1885. MILWAUKEE’S LOSS. Two ot Milwaukee's Large Flouring Mills Harned to the Ground —A Terrific Ki ploslou of Flour Duet Mangles Four Firemen—The Heaviest Loss of the Tear. At an early hour on the morning of the Bth inst. Milwaukee was visited by the most disastrous conflagration that has occurred in that city since the Chap man fire in October last year. Two of the oldest and finest flour- mills in the Northwest the Daisy and Empire, located between Commerce Street ami the old canal bed -immediately north of Poplar Street, are now blackened ruins. The Daisy Mill is a total loss and the Empire Mill nearly so. Soon after the discovery of the tire a terrific ex plosion of flour dust occurred in the top floor of the Daisy mill, wrecking the building and seriously if not fatal ly injuring four firemen. The entire fire department and all the available men on tlie police force were, called out, but both buildings were totally destroyed with their stocks and ma chinery. The owners of the Empire Mill, S. H. Seamans & Cos., estimate their joss at $8o,00(). The Daisy was Owned by Edward Sanderson and E. P. Allis, who place their loss at about §IOO,OOO. There was $85,000 insur ance on the two mills. !>t: t in / v .1 st U f i{. Four Men Crushed to I>eth and Three Others Injured at Akron, O. At Okron, 0., late on the afternoon of the 9th, a s"ewer which was being constructed caved in, burying seven laborers, four of whom were crushed to death and three others injured so badly that they will probably die. The cave occurred without a moment’s warning. The ground, which had been frozen for two or three days, was softened by a thaw. Threeof the men were standing on a scaffolding and the four others at the bottom of the sewer, which had been excavated to the depth of 22 feet. Suddenly the timbers began cracking, and the water-soaked earth for a distance of 20 feet on each side of the sewer, rolled down upon the unfortunate workmen. Win. McGill, one of the men on the scaffold, escaped, but all the others were caught by the mass of timber and earth. A great crowd of people soon assembled. The groans of the men, who were but partially buried, were heart rending. They called for assist ance, but for some time uu one would venture near the hole. Finally a large force of men was set to work with shovels and in half an hour two of the victimes were taken out. They were yet alive, but in terrible agony. An other hour of digging brought them to a third man whose groans had guided the rescuing party. Near him was found the body of a fourth man dead. It being apparent at that time that the others were dead the search was abandoned for the night. The list o; the killed and wounded is as follows: Max Rosensweg, age 27, single, dead; Henry Frigert, dead; unknown Italian, dead; unknown Italian, dead; John Wykof, manied, chest and abdomen crushed and leg broken, will die; Henry Walter, aged 35, married, legs crushed and scalp wound; may recover; Augus tus Krebst, aged 28, believed to be fa tally injured. in A #•’. i /./, f .v<' tiEASI, Four Men Killed and Another Fatally In jured. Another accident happened on the new Croton aqueduct, near Mer ritt's Corners, N. Y., on the morning of the 7th, at shaft No. 3, and resulted in the death of four men and the prob ably fatal injury of a liftli. The men were descending to work in one of the buckets used for lowering them down the shaft. The start was made all right, but before the bucket had de scended many feet the cross beam or “quilly,” as it is called, caught in the shat and remained fast until the bucket had almost reached the bottom of the shaft, when it shook loose and came crashing down a dis tance of over a hundred feet on the heads of the unfortunate men. The fol lowing men were instantly killed Francis Carr, single: Fred. Dresser, single; Lorenzo Dobbins, married, leaves a wife and family at Hibernia, N. .1.; Patrick Moran, married. John Boardman, the other unfortunate man, will probably die of his injuries. When the cross-beam struck the buck et he was knocked out, but in his de scent fell on a shelving constructed near the bottom and on the sideof the shaft. This in all probability saved him from instant death. HTOOiK fti 1./ Vf. TES T /.?/ 0 .% I . The Story ol a Frightful Crime Told in a Court at Koine—lnfuriated Auditors.

Nkw York, Dec. 9,-Wra. 11. Van derbilt died suddenly at his residence in Newport City yesterday afternoon, while chatting with Robert Garrett, president of the Baltimore A- Ohio Railroad, in regard to the latter com pany’s new terminal facilities by way of Staten Island. Mr. Vanderbilt showed a lively interest in the results that were to follow for the island of his birth from the new enterprise, and it was while the call turned upon this, the scenes of his childhood and early work, contrasted with thetremendous achievements of his old age, that Mr. Garrett, sitting on a sofa and facing the millionaire, who leaned forward in his arm-chair, as was his habit when thoroughly interested, was suddenly 7 made aware of a slight indistinct ness in Mr. Vanderbilt’s speech that grew into an inarticulate sound. As he leaned over to catch his words Mr. Vanderbilt pitched forward without warning and fell heavily on the floor on his face. Mr. Garrett sprang to his feet and seizing a pillow from the sofa laid it under his friend’s head, t hen summoned Mrs. Vanderbilt and George, the youngest son. Mes sengers were sent in haste for physicians. One from the neigh borhood responded first, and was followed almost immediately by the family doctor, James W. Mc- Lean. Such simple restoratives as were at hand had been hurriedly ap plied. hut human aid was in vain. Mr. Vanderbilt never spoke or moved after he fell under the sudden stroke, and died in a few minutes without a struggle. To all intents and purposes, he was dead the instant he fell upon the floor. Mr. Vanderbilt was nearly 05 years of age. The children Mr. Vanderbilt leaves are, in their regular succession from Cornelius, who is about 40 years of age, down: Cornelius, William K., Frederick W.,and (merge W.,and four daughters—Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, Mrs. William I). Sloane, Mrs. Hamil ton McK. Twombly, and Mrs. Dr. Seward Webb. Cornelius and William K. are both actively engaged in the management of the family railroad in terests, and will so continue. Cornelius is the chairman of the board of direct ors of the New York Central and the Michigan Central systems, and Will iam K. holds the same office in the Lake Shore and Nickel-plate systems. Frederick W., who is about 32 years old, is a director in all the roads. Mr. Vanderbilt was, it is thought, richer than any single member of the Rothschild family. The Duke of West minster is said to be worth $200,000,- 000, but Mr. Vanderbilt was richer, because the 1 )uke’s money only pays him about 2 per cent., being mainly in lands ami houses. Mr. Vanderbilt had a much larger income. Last year he held 854,000,000 of 4 percent, bonds, and later he reduced this amount to $35,000 000 of government 3'., per cents. His government bonds were worth almost $75,000,000. At one time he owned 240,000 shares of Michigan Central; 300,000 shares of North-Western, and 200,000 shares of Lake Shore. He is said to have sold considerable Lake Shore lately. In addition he had 30,- 000 shares of Chicago & Rock Island, 20.000 of Delaware <k Lackawanna, and about 20,000 shares in other railroads, making in all about 860,- 000 shares of railway stock; also 822,000,000 worth of railroad bonds, $3,200,000 of state and city bonds,and $2,000,000 in various manufactur ing stocks and mortgages. He valued his house on Fifth Avenue, with its art treasures, at $3,000,000. His or dinary household expenses weres2oo,- 000 a year. In 1884 he gave a ball that cost $40,000. He loved horses, and was a good judge of horse-flesh. He sold Maud S. for $40,000. Mr. Vanderbilt was worth $200,000,000. Although his fortune shrank last year materially through a big de cline in stocks, and through busi ness depression, the “bull” movement of the past few months brought it up again. His income was calculated as follows: $2,372,000 a year from gov ernment bonds, $7,394,000 from rail road stocks, and $575,095 from mis cellaneous securities; total over $lO,- 000,000 a year, or $28,000 a day, $1,200 an hour, or $19.75 a minute. He made no ostentatious display of his wealth and was charitable, al though in this he had to be quiet, or lie would have been overrun by im postors. He was shrewder in business than many supposed he was. He knew enough to sell 250,000 shares of New York Central stock live years ago at $1.20, and buy governments at par. AT IT AHAtX. The Mormaus at Salt Lake City X'sing New Weapons. A Salt Lake dispa ;ch of the 7th inst., says: “The arrest, conviction and inpnsonment of Mormon leaders | for polygamy have not only roused the • Mormons to great indignation and re- I vengeful bitterness, but have caused I them to retaliate by importing prosti j tutes from San Francisco and Denver, ; and using these women to entrap fed i eral officers and prominent Gentiles. In this city they have been partiaully ■ successful, having caused a tew arrests ! of officials and Gentiles. One deputy Fnited States marshal was arrested j for fornication under the city charter. He was taken from the custody of the city authorities by writ of ha bras corpus by Fnited States author ities, who declared the city ordi nance invalid, because it exceeded the authority granted by the Legislature. The other night another deputy-mar shal was assaulted by what he called four Mormon assassins, one of whom he dangerously shot. The Mormons and their papers denounce the shoot ing as the act of an assassin, who made the first assault, and the Mor mon press is calling for blood atone ment. These are the causes that make Salt Lake a volcano to-day, lia ble io break forth at any moment. Threats have been made that the en tire Gentile population will be out. and excitement and fea: are iu* i reasing from day to day.” Times I.V A T F. Vf.tff. Vl. Twelve People Cremated lu a Rookery at Plymouth, England. At Plymouth, Eng., on the 13th, a tenement house on Love Street, iu a low and squalid neighborhood, took fire, and a terrible calamity resulted. The flames burned rapidly and fiercely, and when at last subdued twelve hu man bodies were found among the mins. Two others are missing, and in all probability they, too, have been burned to death. One unfortunate victim was smashed to pieces by jump ing from a high window to the*street. Several or the occupants of the build ing, in their fright, ignored the fire escapes, and throwing bedding to the pavement forty feet below, jumped from windows. A number of these had legs and arms broken by the fear ful leap. A harrowing incident of the calamity, was the appearance of a youth named Bickford, who, with his little sister in oneaim, hungsuspended from a window by the other for some minutes, until the flames surrounded him and caused him to lose his hold and fall to the ground. He had both legs fractured. The child was also se verely injured. The intensity of the flames gave the building the appear ance o! a furnace, but this did not de ter the firemen, many of whom entered the house and by a heroic struggle suc ceeded in rescuing several persons. I I!O ft THU tItXIAStS. A Pennsylvania Family Stricken Down With the Dread Disease. A Pittsburg dispatch of the 10th says: “Som.e two weeks ago the fam ily of Frederick Hausmeyer, a well-to do German of Tarentum, Pa., eighteen miles from this city, ate heartily of a salad of which raw pork, chopped line, was one of the principal ingredients. Last Friday the entire family,consist ing of the father, mother, three sons and three daughters, were suddenly seized with a terrible illness. The symptoms were all the same. The family continued to grow worse, and yesterday Frederick, aged 20 years, died in great agony. John, thesecond son, is now so low that he is not ex pected to live through the night, and the rest are at the point of death. Be fore Frederick’s death the physician became convinced that the disease was trichiniasis. He secured some of the meat and with the aid of the micro scope, found it alive with trichina spirals.” The meat was purchased from a farmer, and was taken from one of a drove of hogs which he had raised on his own farm. i / torsi t tit. The hritiKh Parliament in a Mont Pe culiar Condition. A dispatch of the 9th in regard to the English elections says: “Seven parliamentary seats remain to be de clared. The Liberals count upon ob taining three of these seats, which would raise their total to 334 against 330 Conservatives and Nationalists. A report, which is believed in the Lib eral clubs, is current to the effect that Gladstone has decided to seize the first chance to oust the Conservatives. He is said to be eager for office, proposing to conclude his public life with the pro duction of a home rule measure for Ireland. Mr. Bradlaugh has entered into negotiations with the Liberal leaders. He proposes not to present himself at the liar of the House of Commons to take the oath of office at the opening of Parliament, provided the Liberals will introduce and sup port a bill allowing members elect to affirm instead of taking the oath.” The number of members of the new House of Com rnons never 1 efore elect ed to Parliament, is 332. This has had no parallel since the first Parliame: i under the reform bill in 1832. H I l £.VT HOT 

EXOIJH*:. The Servians Refuse to tie Whipped and Hunker for Hlocd. A dispatch of the 10th says it is not believed at Belgrade that the powers will be able to prevent a decisive battle being fought between the Bulgarians and Servians. The Servians will not admit that they have been conquered. They now have a large army, com posed of the (lower of the nation, con centrated at Belgrade, and are burning to retrieve their military honors. Ser via has sent a circular to the foreign ministers stating that she cannot accept the Bulgarian conditions as the price of peace because they are dishon orable. Hostilities will therefore b resumed. Forty Servians have been shot for mutilating themselves bj blowing their trigger fingers ot! and othei wise injuring themselves to escane military service.

The mayor of Newark, X. .1., has issued a proclamation authorizing the police to kill all dogs on the streets unmuzzled. Four of the six bitten children will sail on the French line steamer Canada, for Paris, to be treated by Pasteur. Four hundred dollars has been contributed for the ex penses of the trip, and an the steam ship company has offered to carry the unfortunate children at merely nom inal rates, it is thought that this sum will suffice. I HESVEHATE Ail T. Unsuccessful Attempt of h Marti ere r to Escape. Andrew Johnson, who is wanted in Roan County, Tenn., for murder, was brought to Chattanooga, Tenn., on the Bth, irom Texas. He made a very daring attempt to escape while the train was passing over a high trestle at the rate o: thirty-five miles an hour. Johnson was seated beside the guard on the car, when he suddenly broke from him and leaped through the win dow. alighting in a deep morass. He fell at least forty feet, and sunk to his shoulders in the swamp. The train stopped as soon as possible, and the officer succeeded in recapturing the prisoner. Outwitting the Sheriff. [From the Dexter Me.j Gazette.] A correspondent tellsthestory of an old time Bancor sea-captain’s escape from a sheriff, many years ago. The sheriff went aboard the schooner with a warrant for the captain’s arrest. The mariner received him cordially and invited him to s*-p imo the cabin to take refreshment. This refre ! - meiit was 1 aken in the guice of a drink of sanr-i Cruz rum which the captain had brough* from the West Indies him self. Tne sheriff took several drinks §2.00 A YEAR. and swapped a number of jokes and yarns with the captain, becoming ex hilarated. and forgetting his errand. At last he bethought himself of Ins duty, and told his entertainer, with an expression of tegret, that he must arrest him and take him before a mag istrate, hoping that the trouble would be explained and the respondent dis charged. ‘‘But Mr. Sheriff,” replied the captain, “you are not within your that pre cept now. “Whv.” said the sheriff, "we are at Bangor,ain’t we?” “Well, no, I rather guess not,” said the cap tain." “We’ve got pretry well down the bay by this time. Do you want to go to Baltimore with me?” 11 am /t v t ,w on >i o\s. .An Outhretili Frsrod. and luitrd States Trnojis Ordered to Salt l.akc Clly. A Salt Lake dispatch of the sth snet.,says; “Thecityis full of rumors to-day of Mormon secret meetings, storage- of arms, and the movement of United States troops. It is pretty well settled that a company of soldiers from Fort Douglas will picket the city to guard against disorder and to pro tect life and property. A battery of artillery from Nebraska, is said to be on its way here. Crowds of Mormon men in the temple block, tnis after noon, caused the starting of some wild rumors, but it is now thought no sig niticance could be attached to it. The firingof salutes to the memory of Vice- President Hendricks, at Ft. Douglass, set the city on edge till the cause was understood.” An Omaha dispatch of the same date says: “Late last night it became known that mysterious or ders had been received at military headquarters here, Department of the Platte. (en. Howard, commanding officer, was out of the city on a lecturing tour, but was telegraphed for and re turned at 6 o’clock this morning. He refuses to give definite information on the orders. It is learned, however, that Battery B, from Fort Omaha, was ordered to Fort Douglass, Utah, at once. They left at 2 this after noon. It is understood, also, that all troops in the department have been ordered in readiness for movement at a moment’s notice. From the fact that the troops are bound for Utah, the general impression prevails that Mormon troubles are expected, but of exactly what nature all efforts have failed to disclose. One theory is that an outbreak of some kind is feared from secret information in the posses sion of the government. Another is that the President’s message will con tain expressions on Mormonism which may create a disturbance. As there are no Indian troubles in the section to which the troops have been ordered, conjecture on the Mormon question is the only reasonabletheory advanced.” A Chinaman's Wedding Gift. [Flora the Baltimore Sun.] As readers of the .Sun are aware, there is at Emmanuel Episcopal Church, Read and Cathedral Streets a Chinese Sunday-school, at which nearly a hundred Mongolians assem ble every Sunday afternoon and re ceive instructions in the Christian re ligion. The school has many p vul iaritics, one of which is that earn pu pil requires a special teacher. The majority of the teachers are young la dies, and recently one of them, who had determined to take upon herself the training of an American husband, informed her Chinese pupil, to whom she had become greatly attached, of the contemplated change in her con dition, and invited him to the wedding at the church. The young Chinaman, who keeps a laundry on West Haiti more Street, manifested his apprecia tion ot his preceptor’s confidence and set about doing the honors of the oc casion in true American style. On the day before the wedding there arrived at the bride’s residence, from a lead ing jewelry firm, a package containing a handsome present of silver, attached to which was a card bearing the Chi naman's name, and, in addition, the exact cost of the article in Ameri can money. On the day of the wed ding he was present at the church to see his teacher married. The grati tude of the Chinaman was appreciated all the more as it was wholly unex pected, but the bride’s friends are curi ous as to the origin of the custom of ticketing the present with its price. The Mikado’s Trademark. “Ever gee any Japanese money?” said an antiquarian the other day. “Here’s some of the modern pieces. Their coins used to be oblongandoval strips of gold and silver, with charac ters stamped into them, but tbe Japs are getting civilized fast, and their modern coins are struck from dies, like ours. You see that the reverse of each piece has a chrysanthemum, in relief. That’s the mikado's trade mark or totem. They say that all his private belongings are stamped or eni broidered with it. The Tycoon of Japan has three mallow leaves for his private mark. The interest in those things lies in their descent from a for mercondition of barbarism or savage ry. when men made their signatures with ‘totems,’ or attempted likenesses of natural objects. Even to this day the Indian chief signs his name with a pictureof a turtle or buffalo, or snake, or some such animal, and Sitting Bull’s autograph is a sketch of a bull squatting on his haunches. Indians are named from some object or event conspicuous at the time of their birth, so I suppose an old bull was resting his rump on the sage brush when sit ting Bull made his appearance in the world. The Japs have grown away from the barbarism that wou! i use the picture of an animal for a totem. Thej* are an artistic people, and flow ers areprettier than bulls and snakes.” Chamois Ijeaiher. When a skin, properly cleaned and soaked in water, has oil or grease for cibly rubbed into its pores, the oily matter combinas with the fibres, and renders the skin permanently soft. Water only evaporates during tiiedry ing, and the result is a kind of leather called “chamois,” “shammy,” or “shamoyed,” from the fact that the skin of the chamois appears to have been the first treated in this way. When such leather is dyed it will bear washing, and hence it is also called “wash leather.” The best leather of this kind in Great Britain is prepared from doe or sheep skin, while for in ferior kinds the flesh side of a split sheep skin is used, the grain side be ing “tawed” for skiver, such as is used for hat linings, etc. Mary Asdersoit blushes when ladies praise her to her lace. i nscoxsix state xe u s.
