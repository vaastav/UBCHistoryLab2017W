Isthmian Canal Commission Submits Its Report. Many Advantages ou the Side of -Panama lloute. PREFERENCE IS GIVEN To the Other Line For Reasons Fully Set Forth. Estimated Cost Is $189,864, 062 For Completion. Washington, Dec. 4. The report of the Istnmiau canal commission was sent to congress today. The commission as anticipated several weeks ago, fa vors the .Nicaragua route and makes an estimate of $1S,;4.062 as the totU cost of construction of the canal through Nicaragua. The estimated cost of the Panama route is $144,233,358. but the re port Fays, it would cost $109,141,000 to obtain the Panama concession. The commission value the work done at J40.000.000. The report says the Panama route is feasible as a sea level canal, while the Nicaragua route must be by looks, but Lake Nicaragua will furnish an inex haustible supply of water for the canal. The Nicaragua route has no natural harbors at either end. but satisfactory harbors may be constructed. Harbors already exist at each end of the Pan ama route, but considerable work must be done at the entrance of the harbor on the Atlantic side. With adequate force and plant, the commission esti mate that the Nicaragua canal can be completed in six years exclusive of two years for preparation. Ten years is estimated to complete the Panama. The total length of the Nicaragua route is 183.66 miles and the Panama route 49.09 miles. The estimated cost of op erating and maintaining the Nicaragua canal annually is $1,350,000 greater than that of the Panama canal. The esti mated time for a deep draught vessel to pass through the Panama canal is 12 ruhus and through Nicaragua canal 33 hours. The Nicaragua route, the report says, is more advantageous for commerce, save that originating on the west coast of South America. For the gulf ports the advantage Is two days and for most of the ports on the Atlantic and Pa cific, one day. The Nicaragua route is paid to be better for sailing vessels on account of favoring winds. Hygienic conditions also favor Nicaragua. The commission says the United States should acquire control of a strip of ter ritory ten miles wide from sea to sea through which to build the canal. The consent of Nicaragua and Costa Rica must be obtained to construct the ca nal but the report says this can easily be secured. The concessions granted by the Colombian government to the Panama Canal company have many years to run and new concessions can not be granted the United States. The report concludes as follows: "After considering all the facts de veloped by the investigations made by the commission, the actual situation, as it now stands and having in view the terms offered by the new Panama Canal company, this commission is of the opinion that the most practicable and feasible route for an isthmian ca nal, to be under the control, manage ment and ownership of the United States, is that known as the Nicaragua route." ABOUT THE MESSAGE. State Officers Who Read It Commend the Document. Very few of the state officers have yet read any considerable portion of President Roosevelt's message. Most of them claim to have "read a little of it" or "skimmed through it," but the only one who has read the entire mes sage is Superintendent Frank Nelson. Governor Stanley states frankly that he hasn't had time to read any of it. He thinks it will keep for a day or two and will be just as good when he gets around to it as it is now. "The message is a wonderful docu ment," said Superintendent Nelson. "I took it up into my library last night and read every line of it fro-n the be ginning to Theodore Roosevelt' at the end. It struck me that two of the most important recommendations in it, so . far as the west is concerned at least, " are those concerning forestry and irri gation. They show that Roosevelt is a wonderful man; that he has a person al knowledge of the matters he speaks about: he goes Into the geology, and mineralogy, and zoology and botany of the whole business. Roosevelt isto me a wonderful personality." Attorney General Godard sald: "I haven't had time to read the message to any extent, but what little I have read strikes me as excellent." ( Secretary Coburn: "It suggests that President Roosevelt Is a virile, up-to-date American, endowed with right ideas, and the courage to express and put them in effect. It will be a wonder if his straightforwardness and inde pendence, while endearing him to the people, do not attract the enmity and opposition of an army of politicians, lixers and patronage brokers. How ever, one term with the right sort of record behind it, such as it is in his power to make, should be worth more to him than an age of ruiership obtain ed by subserviency to low ideals and a questionable patriotism. There is Email chance for misunderstanding the president on any subject of which his message treats. He is my kind " State Auditor Cole: "I have not vet tiad time to go through the messageas thoroughly as I should like, but from the portions I have head here and there I am greatly pleased with it" State Treasurer Grimes: "The mes sage is all right. It shows that Pres ident Roosevelt Is a great man. He grasps the topics now before the Amer ican people in a masterly manner " Assistant Attorney General Clad Hamilton: "I have read onlv a fen paragraphs here and there in the mes sage, but I've got a copy right here in my pocket that I propose to read as soon as I can find time. From what I have read I judge that Roosevelt wrote it himself all right. It sounds like him Til make a prediction, too: that he won't get the anarchist vote when he wmea up for re-election."

WAYSIDE. Interesting Telephone Conversation With Mayor Hughes. In the vault in the department of agriculture in the state house is a tele phone. Here is a conversation one end of it, rather which took place over that 'phone today: ' Hello, central. Give me two No. 2, I mean. "Hello. Is this Mayor Hughes? "Well, this is Coburn, at the state house. Wha ? This is Coburn, at the state house. "Yes. "Can you hear? "You know, Colonel, it is customary for the governor to make the address of welcome on behalf of the state to the state board of agriculture, which meets on January 8, and for the mayor to make the address of welcome on behalf of the city. I want to invite you to carry out the usual custom at the com ing meeting. What? "Don't know that you'll be mayor? "Yes. "Oh, I understand. The supreme court may take its guess on the matter be tween now and then. "Yes. "Well, in that case I suppose I would have to call on your friend Parker, but otherwise I will depend on you. "Yes. "Goodbye." ADULTERATED WOOL Is the Subject of a Paper Read at Live Stock Convention. Chicago, Dec. 4. The second session of the convention of the National Live stock association began at 9 o'clock and the attendance showed that a large ma jority of the delegates were enjoying the entertainment offered by the stock show and at other places. Mr. F. G. Hagenbarth of Idaho, read a paper on "The adulteration of wool." He presented facts to show that wool was adulterated and showed that adul terated wool prevents the wool grower of a much enlarged market and was therefore a material injury to his in terests and called for prompt regula tion. It was also to the interests of the wool manufacture that adulteration should be curtailed. The public, he said, did not demand the adulterated stuff, but it was the clothier and the cheap retailer and the bogus manufacturer who beguiled the public into the belief that it was buying all wool, when in reality it was buying shoddy and cot ton and paj'ing all wool prices therefor. He urged the passage of a bill by con gress providing for the inspection of woolen goods and shoddy and the pro per stamping of the same, a fine of from $50 to $500 to be imposed for each violation of the law, by a manufacturer and from $100 to $1,000 for a dealer who buys unstamped adulterated cloth, or sells it, in the piece, or as clothing. Gifford Pinchol, government forester spoke of "The grazing problem in the forest reserves." He said there were certain places where the interests harm fully affected by grazing in the forest reserves were so overwhelmingly great that grazing was out of the question, among others the Bull Run forest res ervation in Oregon and the reserves of southern California but there were vast regions in which nothing but reasona ble regulation was required to make the grazing industry altogether safe and to demonstrate that it might always, as it always should be a help and not a hindrance to every other interest in the community. J. Sterling Morton, ex-secretary of agriculture, read a paper entitled, "The inconsistency of the Grout bill." which provides for a tax upon butterine and oleomargarine. HAVE AN EDITORS' DAY. That May Be a Feature of Mid winter Exposition. Col. J. E. Norton, commissioner of conventions of the Kansas Midwinter exposition, R. S. Brigham, secretary and manager and T. J. Anderson, sec retary of the Commercial club appeare-i before the committee of the Kansas Editorial association at the Copeland hotel last night to extend an invitation for the Kansas editors to visit the ex position in a body here during one day of the show. The action of the committee in select ing a date for the meeting in February will prevent carrying out original plans of the managers of the fair. It was hoped to run an excursion from the city selected for the meeting place of the convention, but in view of the fact that the convention is not to be held until after the exposition closes, other plans will be adopted. "It is more than probable," said Man ager R. S. Brigham today, "that one day early in the exposition will be set aside as editors day and arrangements made for the entertainment of those who come. "We believe the exposition should bring the manufacturers of Kansas and the editors into a nearer relation to each other. Because of the reduce! rates a large number of people will undoubtedly attend the show and be come acquainted with the products dis played. By systematic advertising af terwards, the manufacturer should be able to increase the volume of business materially." WHITE HOUSE DINNER. Republican Leaders Sit at the President's Table. Washington, Dec. 4. President Roose velt entertained at dinner last night a number of the Republican leaders in the senate and house. They included the following: Speaker Henderson, Senators Allison, Piatt (Conn.), Hanna, Cullom, Proctor, Elkins, Perkins, Scott, Beveridge, Kean, representatives Cannon, Grosvenor and Dalsell, and Gen. Leonard Wood. After the dinner the guests remained for some time, giving an opportunity for a free exchange of opinion regard ing the work of the present session of congress. Death of Gen. Hazen. Washington, Dec 4. Gen. A. D. Ha zen, who was third assistant postmaster general under Postmaster Generals Wanamaker and Bissell, died at his res idence in this city late" last night. He was 61 years of age. 

UNPRECEDENTED. Amount of Gold in the Treasury Unequaled In This Country or Any Other With One Exception. MR. GAGE'S REPORT. Silver Certificates Are Super ceding: Small Bank Notes. Growing Use of Gold in Currency Is Noted. the Washington, Dec. 4. Secretary of the Treasury Gage today submitted his annual report. Upon the subject of the reserve fund he says: The reserve fund and the trust fund have been maintained. The redemptions of United States notes have been each day adjusted by exchange for gold, so that the full sum of $150,000,000 has been kept unchanged in coin and bullion. Upon the withdrawal of treasury notes as the bullion of 1890 was coined into standard dollars, silver certificates under the act of March 14, 1900, were substituted to the extent of $10,743,000 to July 1. 1900, and $28,244,000 additional to July 1, 1M01. The gold certificates upon deposit of the metal were in creased during the fiscal year by $45,- 160,270, and in the first quarter of 1902 by $31,801,430 additional. The gross gold in the treasury, including the reserve and the tru,st fund against certificates, received an addition of $71,270,325.74 dur ing the fiscal year, and a further addi tion of $34,304,225.50 by October 1, while $13,697,327 more in October brought the aggregate by November 1 to $a42,831,4. This sum in gold was never before equaled in our annals, and only tor a few months some years ago has any other government ever held so much of that precious metal. In the bonds held by the treasurer for the circulation of national banks, an increase is shown for the fiscal year of $41,741,190, and for the first quarter of 1902 of the further amount of $4,oi3,930. As security for public deposits, the bonds held amounted to $1,488,130 less at the close of the fiscal year than at its beginning, and an addition of $2,444,300 took place in the first quarter of 1902. While the circulation per capita was $26.50 on July 1, 1900, and $28.52 on Oc tober 1, 1901, gold certificates more and more entered into the field of large de nominations, and were used almost ex clusively in the payment of customs duties and in the settlements at the clearing house in New York. The United States notes are undergoing a change into the denomination of $10, as larger ones are redeemed, while the sil ver certificates are taking- the place of $1, $2, and $5 notes. Two features are marked in the cur rency first, the growing use of gold, and, second, the constant addition to the small denominations of paper. The gold, including certificates, in circular tion, which was 33.8 per cent of the total circulation on July 1, 1897, was 39.5 per cent on July 1, 1900, 40.2 per cent pn July 1, 1901, and 40.8 per cent on October 1, 1901. The average denomina tion of notes and certificates issued by the treasury, which was $6.34 in the fiscal year 1900, fell to $4.46 in 1901. The number of pieces of government paper issued rose from 78,132,176, repre senting $495,545,000, in 1900, to 91,291,031. of which the face value was $407,102,000, in 1901. In the first quarter of 1901. 21,443,469 pieces issued, representing $100,834,000, while in the like period of 1902 the issues were 26,603,799. of the face value of $110,460,000. and the aver age worth was $4,152. The redemptions in 1900 were 67,530, 735 pieces, of the average value of $4.84 each, aggregating $327,257,424, and in 1901, 81,394,555 pieces, averaging $4.41 in value, and amounting to $358,891,490. In the first quarter of 1901 the pieces were 18,507,709, of the average value of $4.85 and the aggregate of $89,864,500, while in the first quarter of 1902 the pieces were 19,639,514, of the average value of $4.80 and the total of $94,192,- 600. The redemptions of national bank notes show an increase of $50,503,570 during the fiscal year, while the- aver age amount of such notes outstanding increased $79,590,511. The total amount redeemed was greater than in any other year since 1879 save one. -The rate of expense for each $1,000 in notes assorted was 99.56 cents, of which 37.81 cents was for transportation. The rate has never been so low before, as the lowest pre vious figure was $1.07 in 1897. and the highest $2.69 in 1881. The notes are paid for, if by check, on the day on whicn they are received, and if by currency on the succeeding day. The shipments of standard dollars in the fiscal year reached the maximum as usual, in the late autumn, and the amount outstanding was $76,182,326 in December. This fell to $66,588,628 in July. The increase in the year was 5.66 per cent over 1900. For three years the growth of shipments was steady, but not large in the first quarter. In the standard dollars presented at the treasury offices for exchange in silver certificates an increase of 9 per cent appears over the preceding 12 month3, and in the first quarter of 1902 16.6 per cent over the like period of 1901. In subsidiary silver the shipments In the fiscal year were 6.94 per cent great er than in 1900, and in the first quarter of 1902 6.42 per cent greater than for the like period of the preceding year. The redemptions for the year were 15.3 per cent more than in 1900, and in the first quarter of 1902 they were 12.3 more than in the same months of the preceding year. New York Billiard Tourney. New York, Dec. 4. Two matches were played in the international billiard tour nament in the Madison Square Garden concert hall Tuesday afternoon and evening. In the afternoon George Sut ton, of Chicago, defeated Leonard How Ison. of Canada, by a score of 400 to 237. In the evening George F. Slosson, of New York, met Ora Morningstar, Roch ester, Ind., and ran out his 400 points while Morningstar was making 165. Morningstar nad a good deal of hard luck throughout the game, the balls rolling badly for him in nearly every instance. Slosson was very nervous in the early part of the game, but as he gradually gained a commanding lead he regained his usual composure and treated the spectators to some of the finest billiards ever witnessed.

HE WOULD TAKE UP THESLACK. Senator Morgan Thinks There Is Too Much of It In Connection With the Pension Business, lie Says. NEW CANAL TREATY. It Is Laid Before the Senate by the President. Burrows Offers a Bill to Keep Out Anarchists. Washington, Dec. 4. The senate was the only congressional branch in ses sion today. The early business includ ed a flood of executive communications, mainly formal. One of them, from the attorney general, submitted the compil ation of the laws of Porto Rico, in Eng lish and Spanish, as ordered by the last congress. When Mr. Hoar sought to advance the consideration of certain pension bills, Mr. Morgan (Ala.) objected, re marking: "There is too much slack on pensions and I would like to tighten it up a little." The president today sent a number of recess appointments to the senate and the new appointment of George W. Lieberth, of Kentucky, to be collector of internal revenue for the Sixth dis trict of Kentucky. Among the recess appointments sent in was that of At torney General Knox. The president also sent to the senate the new Hay-Pauncefote treaty for an isthmian canal. Mr. McComas (Md.) gave notice that he would address the senate at its next session concerning assaults on the pres ident, the deportation of anarchists, etc. Mr. "Vest (Mo.) offered a resolution proposing an inquiry by the committee on judiciary as to the powers of con gress to deal with anarchy, to suppress the teaching of anarchy and to provide a penal colony for convicted anarchists. The resolution and the anti-anarchist measure by McComac are on the sen ate table open to early debate. Mr. Tillman (S. C.) secured the pass age of a house resolution admitting free of duty foreign exhibits to the Charles ton exposition. At 2:10, on motion of Mr. Cullom, the senate went into executive session. At 2:34 p. m. the senate adjourned. 

AGAINST ANARCHISTS. Senator Burrows Has a Bill For Ex clusion and Deportation. Washington, Dec. 4 Senator Burrows today introduced a bill "to provide for the exclusion and deportation of alien anarchists." The first section of the bill is as fol lows : "That no alien anarchists shall here after be permitted to land at any post of the United States, or be admitted into tha United States; but this prohi bition shall not be so construed as to apply to political refugees, or political offenders, other than such anarchists." The second section directs the special board of Inquiry authorized by the im migration laws to make diligent in vestigation concerning the antecedents of any alien seeking admission into the United States, who is suspected of be ing an anarchist, authorizing the board to even go to the extent of examining the person of suspected aliens for marks indicative of membership in an archistic societies. Section 3 provides for the return of persons to their native countries who have secured admission to the United States contrary to law aad who after ward have been found to be anarchists. The fourth section provides that when any alien is convicted of crime in any United States court and it shall ap pear from the evidence that he is an anarchist, the presiding judge shall di rect a further hearing and if the judge is satisfied that the convicted alien is an anarchist or that his remaining in this country will be a menace to the government or society in general, he may direct that in addition to other punishment adjudged, the convicted alien after undergoing such punish ments, shall be deported at the ex pense of the United States, to the coun try from which he came and if he re turns to the United States shall be punished by imprisonment at hard labor for a period not exceeding five years and afterward again deported." Provision Is made for the appointment of twelve immigration agents at a sal ary of $2,500 each to make investigations in foreign countries concerning intend ed immigrants. The sixth and last section of the bill provides that the "fact that an alien has declared his in tention to become a citizen of the United States shall constitute no bar to proceedings against him under this act." 

EXPECT NO DECISION. Parker-Hnsjhes Case May Be Ordered Reargued The Parker-Hughes decision which will determine who is the legal mayor of Topeka is expected on Saturday when the supreme court decisions are handed down but the Hughes partisans say that the case will be assigned for reargument and they probably know what they are talking about. If this is true it would indicate that the decision hinges upon Justice Ellis. He was sick when the case was argued and so did not sit and it was submitted to six judges. If the case is ordered to be reargued it will mean that there can be no decision before February. A stipulation was agreed to between the attorneys in the case when it was first carried to the supreme court that the decision on this hearing should be accepted as final and that there should be no application for a rehearing or any effort to bring about further delay by either party, because each side de sired the matter settled definitely as soon as possible. Weather Indications. Chicago, Dec. 4. Forecast for Kan sas: Partly cloudy and probably un settled tonight and Thursday; warmer tonight; southerly winds. FIRSTPLACE. Roosevelt's Message Is Given the Greatest Prominence In the Afternoon Newspapers at the British Capital. A CLAIM IS SET UP That England First Thought of Monroe Doctrine And Will Stand by America in Its Enforcement. London, Dec. 4. President Roosevelt's message to congress holds the first place in the afternoon newspapers here today. Strong general approval of the pro nouncement which, as the St. James Gazette says, "strikes notes of con scious strength and assured success," is the pervading tone of the editorials. "The spirited declaration for Monroe ism, will cause a flutter in Europe," says the Westminster Gazette, which continues: "If the kaiser is really of the opinion, as alleged, that 'the American peril' is the question of the future for Europe, he will find confirmation in the message. He will envy Secretary Gage's surplus of $75,000,000 available for building iron clads, or other purposes, for the Ameri can doctrine backed by the American surplus means that many European ambitions in South America are fore doomed to failure. We do not doubt that it is the policy of this country, if called upon to make a choice, to stand by the United States in defense of the doctrine. We are also an American power, and it was we who first suggest ed the idea." Afte noting that South America the only outlet for the surplus population of Europe, is largely in the possession of the corrupt Spanish, over whom the United States throws its aegis, without guaranteeing good government, the Westminster Gazette concludes: "It is not easy to affirm this in the interests of mankind, and when the United States, after warning Europe not to enter America, proceeds itself to step out from the American continent, even a theoretical defense is difficult. The situation has the germs of an im mense controversy in the future." AS 

VIEWED IN AUSTRIA. "Vienna, Dec. 4. Discussing President Roosevelt's message to congress, the Austrian papers are unanimous in praising the references to anarchists, but on other points they are not quite so laudatory. The Fremlen Blatt comments on the peaceful tone of the message remarking that President Roosevelt evidently will not allow himself to be carried away by senseless chauvinists. The Neue-Wiener Tageblatt dHvellson its imperialistic character, adding: . "There lives in America a spirit, as an 'appendant' to the Monroe doctrine formula, of Europe for the Americans and this formula although clad in the most peaceful phrases, pervades the message." The Deutsche Volksblatt declares that the policy enunciated must expand American production and therefore, "measures for the protection of Aus trian production are required by the dictates of self-preservation." The Austrian Volk3 Zeitung believes that the strength of the message lies in the moderation of its tone, adding: "It speaks in the language of a strong man, who knows he requires no sonor ous words to be heard." The Neue-Wiener Journal, also deal ing with the power of the message, rec ommends its close study, so as to "find means at the proper time of spoiling his game." 

SENTIMENTS ON ANARCHY AP PROVED. New York, Dec. 4. No portion of the president's message Is more cordially approved of in England than that re ferring to the question of the treat ment of anarchists, says the London correspondent of the Tribune. It is con sidered exceedingly gratifying that President Roosevelt should not be afraid to make proposals which on the surface are open to the criticism that they are subversive of personal liberty in the matter of opinion. In this coun try there is a strong undercurrent of feeling against laws which permit and actually encourage the immigration of foreign anarchists. London, especially, feels strongly on the point, and owing to the vast number of undesirable aliens who have taken up their abode in the East End, the metropolis would gladly welcome any restrictive meas ures. In reference to the proposal that mankind shouid bind itself together to make anarchy, like piracy, a crime against the law of nations, it is pointed out that the difficulty is to define what anarchy consists of and to obtain trust worthy evidence against those holding such a doctrine before they commit overt acts which would render them amenable to ordinary criminal law.
