Twenty-one tramps, who had been sent to jail for ten days under the vagrant struck tbis morning and refused to work. When the jail officials were pre t aring to seud them out the prisoners pretended they were willing to work but objected to being shackled. A telephone message was sent to the Mayor asking him to allow them to be -;aken out of jail without the balls and chains and the request was denied. He was told that the city had but eight pairs of schackle and that it would be impossible to secure all the prisoners, aud tin- Mayor decided to bring out to day as many as could be shackled aud to-morrow and the next day the others could be brought out, thus forming re? lays. When the decision was commu? nicated to the prisoners they all with one accord struck, refusing positively to do any work for the city. A squad of policemeu was sent to the jail and the strikers brought to the station house and locked up on bread and wa? ter. Of course, the plan of the prison? ers was to get into the streets without the balls and chains and run away.

The government authorities in this city liHve formally decided to abaudon the present St. Asaph street sewer and tap the one recently constructed by the city ou King street. Mr. Thomas W. Robin boh, custodian of the custom house, has received the specifications which provide for an eight-inch terra cotta pipe from th? custom house building to King street. Proposals will be received ot once aud the work prosecuted at soon as possible. The proposition to run the sewer down St. Asaph street ami into Duke was rejected, as it would be uece-sary to tear up seveml squat es to carry out that plan, while in order to carry the sewer to King street a much shorter route is presented with a satis? factory tall, as there is a down grade almost all the way from the custom house. The government will, of course, pay the city lor the privilege of tapping its sewer, and that, to be "built for the use of the custom house will be a strictly private affair which no one will be al? lowed to tap.
