HALEY Editor nut Publubtr THE IEACE CONFERENCE President Wilson, Secretary ol Stnic Robert Lunsinn ami Henry White, Iniintr ambassador to France nnil Italy, sailed Wednes day, December 4, for France C(lmicl U. M. House and (ibncr.il Tanker II. HlidH are already in France. The live liijrc niuiied constitute the representatives of thu United States at the peace conference. Considerable criticism of the president's action in KIK as 01U' of tliv representatives lias been Indulged hi, much of it from friendly sources; anil :ils, ap parently, from the best of motives. However, Hip carping criticism indnJjfbd'iil by Colonel Wooscveli and, if postible, Hint still mure spectacular senator from Illinois who suffers from a porioilic.il brain-storm need excite no one There may be a ipiestion nstothe propriety and necessity of the president Inking a part in the cnuleretice, and results only will tell whether or not it was advis able. The president stated in his message to congress the reasons why he felt it incumbent on him to go; and, possessed of such n feeling, he didn't hesitate to o uin representative! iiotwithstaiid ii the criticism by friend and fOc, As wu said before, results are the things that count, and the president bus shown that he pos sostea a keener insight into affairs than aify American, that his critics have been repeatedly con founded by his success in the face of their criticism, and we leel as sured that be wo'uhl not have gdiie had u great necessity not uXisted, and the further tact that llis prmencB was very much de sired by the allies. Honest criticism of any oflicial is not only permissible, but is uxcrciscd, without abridgement, and is in harmony with our insti tution and, traditions; but none of us need to be thrown nIT our balance by the braying of mem bers of the long-eared tribe that believe noise is convincing. Former President Kooscvtdt suys President Wilson's trip to France Is uncalled for and the president's famous " fourteen points" were of no concern to our siildiurs nor our allies.

Mine Active Operations on the American i mine at Nogal began this week j active operations on tne mine Itself. Machinery ha.cl been in stalled, including large pumps for dewatering the mine. It is cur rently reported we didn't get the information from President Fill mer, who is not particularly com municative that the dewateriug of the mine- and all preliminary operations preceding the actual extraction of ore will require Irom sixty to ninety days. The American is one of the oldest and by many considered one of the best gold mines in the county. It has produced some very rich ore and its further development will, it is believed, I justify the cost now incurred to reach the ore. The mine lias i been idle for many years, due largely to litigation, but also to lack of cheap power. These drawbacks no longer exist and the property may now be econom ically and profitably operated. Bring us your hides and pelts, we guarantee highest market prices. Carrizozo Trading Co.
