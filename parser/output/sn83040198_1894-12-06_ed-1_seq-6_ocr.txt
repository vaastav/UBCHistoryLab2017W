NATIONAL AFFAIRS. The President's Annual Communi cation to Congress. A General Review of the Various Depart ments of tlie Government Financial Condition and the Issue of Kew ISonds. Wabittvotov. Dec 3. Followinsr is President Cleveland's message to the second session of the Fifty-third con gress: To the Congress of the United States: The assemblage within the nation's legisla tive halls of those charged with the duty of making laws for the benefit of a generous and free people impressively suggests the exacting obligation and inexorable responsibility in volved in their task. At the threshold of such labor now to be undertaken by the congress of the United States, and in the discharge of an executive duty enjoined by the constitution. I submit this communication, containing a brief statement of the condition of our national af fairs and recommending such legislation as ecems to me necessary and expedient. Oar Foreign Relations. The history of our recent dealings with other nations and our peaceful relations with them at this time additionally demonstrated the ad vantage of consistently adhering to a firm but just foreign policy, free from envious or am bitious national schemes and characterized by entire honesty and sincerity. I have endeavored to impress upon the Bel gian government the needlessness and positive harmfulness of i3 restrictions upon the im portation of certain of our food products and have strongly urged that the rigid supervision and inspection under our laws are amply suf ficient to prevent the deportation from this country of diseased cattle and unwholsome meat. On th8 17th of March last a new treaty with China in further regulation of emigration was signed at Washington and on August 13 it re ceived the sanction of the senate. . Actinc unnn the renortfid discoverv of Texas fever in cargoes of American cattle the Ger man prohibition against importations of live stock and fresh meats from this country has been revived. It is hoped that Germany will soon become convinced that the inhibition is as needless as it is harmful to mutual inter ests. The German government has protested against that provision of the customs tariff act which imposes a discriminating duty of one tenth of one cent a pound on sugars coming from countries paying an export bounty there on, claiming that the exaction of such duty its in contravention of articles five and nine of the treaty of 1828 with Prussia. In the inter ests of the commerce of both countries and to avoid even the accusation of treaty violation, I recommend the repeal of so much of the statute as imposes that duty and I invito at tention to the accompanying report of the secretary of state containing a discussion of the questions raised by fhe German protests. Early in the present year an agreement was reaehed with Great Britain concerning instruc tions to be given to the naval commanders of the two governments in Behring sea' and the contiguous North Pacific ocean for their guid ance in the execution of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbitration and the enforcement of the regulations therein prescribed for the pro tection of seal life in the watersjnentioned. Since communicating the voluminous corre spondence in regard to Hawaii and the action taken by the senate and house of representa tives on certain questions .submitted to the judgment and wider discretion of congress the organization of a government in place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of the queen has been announced with evidence of its effective operation. The recognition usual in such cases has been ac corded the new government. Apart from the war in which the island em pire is engaged, Japan attracts increasing at tention in this country by her evident desire to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us and to seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her laudable desire for complete autonomy in her domestic affairs and full equality in the family -of nations. The Japanese empire of to-day is no longer the Japan of the past and our rela tions with this progressive nation should not toe less broad and liberal than those with other XKwers; good will, fostered by many interests in common, has marked our relations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace beins restored along her northern fron tier, Mexico has asked the punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There ought to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one which terminated thirteen years ago. The friendliness of the intercourse between the two countries is attested by the fact during this long period. The commerce of each has steadily increased under the rule of mutual consideration, being neither stimulated by conventional arrangements nor returned by jealous rivalries or selfish desires. ' Peru, I regret to say. shows symptoms of do mestic disturbance, probably due to' the 6lowness of her recuperation from the war of 1881. Weakened in resources, her difficulties In facing international obligations invite our kindly sympathy and justify our forbearance in pressing long pending claims. I have felt constrained to testifv this sympathy in connec tion with certain demands urgently preferred by other powers. The recent death of the czar of Russia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government with his bereaved family and the Russian people. As a further demonstration of respect and friendship our minister at St. Petersburg was directed to represent our government at the funeral ceremonies. The sealing interests of Russia in the Behring sea are second only to our own. A modus vlvendl has therefore been concluded with the imperial government re strictive of poaching on Russian rookeries and of sealing in waters which were not compre hended in the protected area defined in the Paris award. Occasion has been found to urge upon the Russian government equal ';. Ity of treatment for our great life In surance companies whose operations have xn it ting, as we do, foreign corporations to transact business in the United States, we naturally expect no less tolerance for our own in the ample fields of competition abroad. But few cases of interference with naturalized cit izens returning to Russia have been reported during the current year. One Krzeminski was arrested last summer in a Polish prov ince, on a reported charge of unpermitted re nunciation of Russian allegiance, but it trans pired that the proceedings originated in al leged malfeasance committed by Krzeminski with an imperial official a number of years ago. Efforts for his release, which promised to be successful, were ia progress when his death was reported. The rules for the prevention of collision at sea, which were framed by the maritime con ference in this city in 1333, having been con currently incorporated in the statutes of the United States and Great Britain, have been announced to take effect March 1. It9, and in vitations have been extended to all maratime nations to adhere to them. Favorable re spoases hare thus far been received from Aus tria. France. Portugal, Spam and Sweden, In my lust annual message I referred briefly . to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa under the operation of the Berlin treaty, as signally Illustrating , the policy of entangling alliances with foreign powers: and on May 9, 1894, in response to a resolution of the senate I sent a special message and documents to that body on same subject which emphasized my previously expressed opinions. Later occur rences, the correspondence in regard to which will be laid before congress, further demon strated that the government which was devised by. the three powers and forced upon the Samoans against their inveterate hostility can be maintained only by the continued presence of foreign military force and at no small sacri fice of life and treasure. The suppression of the Mataafa insurrection by the powers, and the subsequent banishment of the leader and seven other chiefs, as recited in my last mes sage, did not bring lasting peace to the islands. Treasury Statement. The secretary of the treasury reports that tho receipts of the treasury from all sources of revenue during the fiscal year ended June .30, 1894, amounted to $37-2,8 )2,4S9.29 and its expend itures to $412,505,753.87, leaving a deficit of $09, 803.200.58. There was a decrease of $15,952,674. 68 In the ordinary expenses of the government, as compared with the fiscal year 1S93. There was collected from- customs $131,818,530 62, and from internal revenue $117,163,449.80. The bal ance of the Income for the year, amounting to $93,81 517.97, was derived from the sales of lands and other sources. The value of our to tal dutiable imports amounted to $275,199,086, being $l43.657,62- less than during the preced ing year and the Importations free of duty amounted to 5379,795,538. being 861,748,673 less than during the preceding year. The receipts fromcustoms were $73,: 36,433.11 less and from internal revenue $13,831.53X974683 than in 1893, The total tax collected from distilled spirits was $85,259,2 0.25, on manufactured tobacco, $28,617,898. 62, and oafermented liquors, $31,414, 788.04. ; '" : Our exports of merchandise, domestic and foreign, amounted during the year to $392,140, 572, being an increase over the preceding year of $14,495,378. The total amount of gold ex ported during the fiscal year was $76,898,061, as against $108,680,444 during the fiscal year 1893. The amount imported was $72,419,119. as against $21,174,381 during the previous year. . Tha im ports of'sllver were $13,283,552, and the exports were $50,451,265. The total bounty paid upon th9 production of sugar in the United States for the fiscal, year was $12,100,308.89, being an increase of $2,725,078.01 over, the payments made during the preceding year. The amount of bounty paid from July 1, 1894. to August 28, 1894, the time when further payments ceased by operation of law, was $965,185,84. The total expenses incurred in the payment of the bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year was $130,140.85. It is estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue laws the receipts of the government during the current : fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, will be $424,427,743.44, and its expenditures $444,427,743.44, resulting in a deficit of $20,000,000. The first day of No vember, 1894, the total stock of money of all kinds in the country was $2,240,773,888, as against $2,204,651,000 on the first day of Novem ber, 1833, and the money of all kinds in circulation or not included in the treasury holdings was $1,672,093,422. or 24.27 per capita upon an estimated population of 68.837,000. At the same date there was held In the treasury gold bullion amounting to $41,615,107.55 and sil ver bullion which was purchased at a cost of $127,779,988. The purchase of silver bullion un der the act of July 14, 1890, ceased on the first day of November, 1893, and up to that time there had been purchased during the fiscal year 11, 917,65a 78 fine ounces at a cost of $8,715, 521.32, an average cost of $0.7313 per fine ounce. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law took effect until the repeal of its purchasing clause on the date last mentioned was 108,674,682.53 fine ounces, which cost $155, 931,002.25, the average price per ounce being $.9:244. The total amount of standard silver dollars coined at the mints of the United States since the passage of the act of February 28, 1893, is $421,770,408, of which $378,163,793 were coined under the provisions of that act, $33, 531,143 under the provisions of the act of July 14, 1890, and $5,078,478 under the act providing for the coinage of trade dollar bullion; the to tal coinage of all metals at our mints during the last fiscal year consisted of 63,485,220 pieces, valued at $106,216,730.06. of which there . was $99,474,912.50 in gold coined, $758 In standard silver; dollars, $3,024,140.30 in subsidiary coin and $716,919.26 in minor coin. During the calendar year 1893 the production of precious metals in the United States was es timated at 1,739,323 fine ounces of gold of the commercial and coinage value of $35,955,000 and 60,000,000 fine ounces of silver of the bullion or market value of $43,800,000 and of the coinage value of $77,576,000. It is estimated that on the first day of July. 1894, the stock of metallic money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $ 1,251, 64 -),9-":3, of which $627,923,201 was gold and $624,347,758 was silver. Fifty national banks were organized during the year ended October 31, 1894, with a capital of $5,285,000, and seventy-nine, with a capital of $10,475,000, went into voluatary liquidation. Twenty-one banks, with a capital of $2,773,000, were "placed In the hands of receivers. The to tal number of national banks in existence on the 31st of October last was 3,756, being 40 less than on the 31st day of October, 1893. The cap ital stock paid in was $672,671,36 being $9,678, 491 less than at the same time in the previous year, and the surplus and undivided profits, less expenses and taxes paid, amounted to $314,121,082.10, which was $16,089'780 less than on October 31 , 1893. The circulation has decreased $1,741,563. The obligations of the banks to each other were in creased $117,269,334, and the individual deposits were $277,294,489, less than at the corresponding date in the previous years. Loans and dis counts were $161,203,923 more than at the same time the previous year, and checks and other cash items were $90,349,963 more. The total re sources of the banks at the date mentioned amounted to $1,473,922,055, as against $3,103, 563,284.38 in 1893. Army Affairs. From the report of the secretary of war it appears that the strength of the army on Sep tember 30, 1394, was 2,135 officers and 25,7i55 en listed men. Although this is apparently a very slight decrease compared with the previous year, the actual effective force has been in creased to the equivalent of nearly two regi ments, through the reorganization of the sys tem of recruiting and the consequent release to regimental duty of the large force of men hitherto serving at the recruiting departments. The abolition of these departments, it is pre dicted, will furthermore effect an annual re duction approximating $250,000 in the direct expenditures, besides promoting generally the health, morals and discipline of the troops, The execution of the policy of concentrating the army at important centers of popu lation and transportation, foreshadowod in the last annual report of the secre tary, has resulted In the abandonment of fifteen of the smaller posts, which was ef fected under a plan which assembles organiza tions of the same regiments hitherto widely separated. This renders our small forces more readily effective for any service which they may be called upon to perform in cases over the ex teat of territory under protection without diminishing the security heretofore afforded to any locality; improves tha discipline, training and esprit de corps of the army, besides consid erably decreasing the cost of its maintenance. Though the force of the department has been somewnat increased. mre than three-fourths of the army is still stationed west of the Mis sissippi. . This caref ully matured policy which secures the best and greatest servico la tho in terests of the general welfare from the small force comprising our regular army should not be thoughtlessly embarrassed by the creation of new and unnecessary posts through acts of congress to gratify the ammtions or interests ' of localities. While the maximum legal : strength of the army is 25,00) men the effective strength, through various causes, is but little over 20,000 men. The purpose of congress does ot, therefore, seem to be fully attained by the existing condition, while no considerable In crease in the army is in my judgment demand ed by recent events. . The policy of sea coast fortifications In pros ecution of which we have been steadily engaged for some years past has so far developed as to suggest that the effective strength of - the army be now made at least equal to the legal strength Measures taken by the department during the year, as indicated, have already augmented the effective force, and the secretary of war pre sents a plan, which I recommend to the consid eration of aongress, to attain the desired end. Economies effected in the department in other lines of its work will offset to a great extent the expenditure involved in the proposition submitted. Among other things this contem plates the adoption of the three battalion for mation of regiment which for several years has been indorsed by the secretaries of war and the generals commanding the army. Compact in itself, it provides a skeleton organization ready to be billed out in the event of war, which is peculiarly adapted ta our strength and require ments; and the fact that every other nation, with a single exception, has adopted this for mation to meet the conditions of modern war fare, should alone secure for the recommenda tion an early consideration. It is hardly nec essary to recall the fact that in obedience to the constitution and the laws and for the pur pose of protecting the property of the United . States aiding the process of federal courts and removing lawless obstruc tions to the performance by the government of its legitimate functions it became necessary in various localities during the year to employ a considerable portion of the regular troops. The duty was discharged promptly, courageously and with marked discretion by tho officers and men and the most gratifying proof was thus af forded that the army deserves that complete confidence in its efficiency and discipline which the country has at all times manifested. ; - The total expenditures for the war depart ment for the year ending June 30; 1894r amounted to $56,039,003.3 L Of this sum $2,000, 614.99 was for salaries and contingent expen ses; $23,635,156.18 for the support of the military establishment; $5,001 ,632.23 for miscellaneous objects, and $25,371,555.96 for public works. This latter sum includes $19,494,037.49 for fiver and harbor improvements and $3,947,803.56 for fortifications and other works of defense. The appropriations for the current year ag gregate $52,429,112.78, and the estimates sub mitted by the secretary of war for the next fis cal year call for appropriations amounting to $52,318,529.55. . . The skill and industry of our ordnance offl cersand inventors have, it is believed,? over come the mechanical obstacles which have heretofore delayed the armament of our coasts, and this great national undertaking upoa which we have entered may now procead as rapidly as congress shall determine, with a supply of finished guns of large caliber already on hand to which additions should now rapidly follow. The wisdom of providing carriages and em placements for their mount cannot be too "strongly urged. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states is 117,753 officers and enlisted men, an increase of 5,343 over the number reported at the close of tha previous year. The reports of militia inspection by regular army officers show a marked increase in interest and efficiency among the state or ganizations, and I strongly recommend a con tinuance of the policy of affording every prac tical encouragement possible to this Important auxiliary of our military establishment. The condition of tha Apache Indians, held as prison ers by the government for eight years at a cost of half a million dollars, has been changed dur ing the year from captivity to one which gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for self-support and at least partial civilization. Legislation enacted at the late session of congress gave the war department authority to transfer In recognition of the long and distinguished military services and faithful discharge of delicate and responsible civil duties by Maj. Gea John M. Schotield, now the general com manding the army, it is suggested to congress that the temporary revival of the grade of lieutenant general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act, and would permit his re tirement now near at hand with rank befitting his merits. The Department of Justice. The report of the attorney-general notes the gratifying progress made by the supreme court in overcoming the arrears of its business and in reaching a condition in which it will be able to dispose of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is of course very largely due to the successful working of the plan inaugurating circuit courts of appeals. In respect to these tribunals the suggestion is made in quarters entitled to the highest con sideration that an additional circuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the confidence reposed in their . adjudication, and that such an addition would not create a greater forca of judges than tha Increasing business of such courts requires. The perma nent solution of what Is called the Indian prob lem is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of present con ditions as the existing, system will admit ought not to be neglected. I am satisfied there should be a federal court established- for the territory with sufficient judges and that this court should sit within the territory and have the same jur isdiction as to territorial affairs as is now vested in the federal courts sitting in Arkansas and Texas. Another subject of pressing moment referred to by the attorney -general is the reorganiza tion of the Union Pacific Railroad Co. on a basis equitable as regards all private inter ests and as favorable to the government as ex isting conditions will permit. The operation of a railroad by a court through a receiver is an anomalous state of things which should be terminated on all grounds, public and private, at the earliest possible moment. It is not my purpose at this time to repeat the considerations which make an Inpregnable case in favor of the ownership and manage ment by the government of the penal institu tions in which federal prisoners are confined. I simply desire to ' again urge former recom mendations on the subject and to particularly call the attention of the congress to that part of the report of the secretary of war, in which he states that the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., can be turned over to the government as a prison for federal convicts without the least difficulty and with an actual saving of money from every point of view. Poet Office Affair. The report of the postmaster-general pre sents a comprehensive statement of the opera tions of th 7ost office department for the last fiscal year. The receipts of the department during the year amounted to $7i,0S3.479.04 and the expenditures of 884.3:4,414.15. The trans actions of the postil service indicate with barometric certainty , the fluctuations in busi nesses of the country. Inasmuch, therefore, as business complications continued to exist the last year to an unforeseen extent it is not surprising that the deficiency of revenues to meet the expenditures of the poss oce denartment. which was estimated ia advance at about $8,033,00 3, snould ba exceeded by nearly $1,250,903. The ascertained revenues of the last year, which were the basis of calcula tion for the current year, being less than esti mated, the deficiency for the current year will be correspondingly greater, though the postmaster-general states that the latest indica tions are so favorable that he confidently pre dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent, ia the revenues ci the current. year over those of the last year. The expenditures increase steadily ana necessarily with the growth and needs of the country, so that the defi ciency is greater or less In any year depending upon the volume of receipts. The postmaster-general states that this deficiency is unnecessary and might be obviated at once if the laws regulating rates upon mail matter of the second class was modified. The rate re ceived for the transmission of this second-class matter is 1 cent per pound, while the cost of such transportation to the government is eight times that amount. In the general terms of the law this rate covers newspapers and peri odicals. .The extensions of the meaning of these terms from time to time have admitted to the privileges Intended for legitimate news papers and periodicals a surprising range of publication, and created abuses the cost of which amounts in the aggregate to the total deficiency of the post office department. Pre tended newspapers are started by business houses for the purpose of advertising goods, complying with the law in form only, and dis continuing the publications as soon as the pe riod of advertising is over. Another abuse con sists in the free carriage through the mails of hundreds of tons of seed and grain, uselessly distributed through the department of agriculture. ' The postmaster-general pre dicts that if the law is so amended as to, eradicate these abuses, not only will the post office department show no deficiency, but he believes that in the near future all legitimate newspapers, periodicals and maga zines might be properly transmitted through the malls to their subscribers free of cost. I invito your prompt consideration of this sub ject and fully Indorse the views of the post master-general. The total number of post offices in the United States on the 30th day of June. 1894, was 69,805, an increase of 1,433 over the preceding year: of these 3,423 were presiden tial, an increase of sixty-eight over the preced ing year. Six hundred and ten cities and towns are provided with free delivery, ninety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the la have not been a-jcorded it on ac count of insufficient funds. Tha expense of free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than $12,300,030, and under existing legis lation this item of expenditure is subject tc constant increase. Tie estimated cost of rural f reo delivery generally is so very large that it ought not to be considered in the present con dition of . affairs. During the year 830 addi tional domestic money order offices were es tablished. The total number of these offices at the close of the year was 19,264. There were 11,304,041 money orders issued during the year, being an increase over the preceding year of 994,303. The value of these ordes amounted to $133,793,579.49, an increase of $11,217,245.84. There were also Issued during the year postal notes amounting to $12,649,034.95. During the year 218 international money order offices were added to those already established, making a total of 2,625 such offices in operation June 30, 1894. The number of international money or ders issued during the year was 917,828, a de crease in number of 133,176, and their value was $13,792,455.31, a decrease in amount of $2, 849,332.95. The number of orders paid was 331, 180, an Increase over the preceding year of 69, 263, and their value was $6,563,493.78, an in crease, of $11,285,118,05. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes for the year amounted to $165,233,129.35. The number of let ters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,436,970. The special de livery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to $343,657. The messen gers' fees paid for their delivery amounted to $261,206.70. leaving a balance in favor of the government of 882,437.30. The report shows most gratifying results in the way of economies in the cost and amount of supplies used in the service, amounting in all to $16,619,047.42. The report also contains a valuable contri bution to the history of the universal postal union, an arrangement which amounts prac tically to the establishment of one postal sys tem for the entire civilized world. There are now connected with the post office establishment 32,651 employes who are in the classified service. This includes many who have been classified upon the suggestion of the postmaster-generaL He states that an other year's experience at the head of the de partment serves only to strengthen the con viction as to the excellent working of the civil service law in this branch of tha public serv ice. Oar Navy. . Attention is called to the report of the sec tary of the navy, which shows very gratifying progress in the construction of ships for our navy. All the vessels now building, including the three torpedo boats authorized at the last session of congress, and excepting the first class battleship Iowa, will probably be com pleted during the coming fiscal year. The es timates for the increase of the navy for the year ending June 39, J 896, are large, but they include practically the entire sum necessary to complete and equip all the new ships now in commission; so that, unless new ships are au thorized, the appropriation for the naval serv ice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, should fall below the estimates for the coming xear by at least $12,000,000. The secretary presents with much earnest ness a plea for the authorization of three ad ditional battleships and twelve torpedo boats. If we are to have a navy for warlike operations, offensive and defensive, we certainly ought to increase both the number of battleships and torpedo boats. The Interior Department. The report of the secretary of the interior exhibits the situation of the numerous and in teresting branches of the public service con nected with his department. - I recommend this report and the valuable recommendations of the secretary to careful attention of congress. The public land disposed of during the year amounted to 10,420,100.77 acres, including 2,837,605 of Indian lands. It is estimated that the public domain still re maining amounts to a little more than 603.003, 000 acres, excluding, however, about 360.033,003 acres in Alaska as well as military reservations and railroad and other selections of lands un adjudicated. An exceedingly important recommendation of the secretary relates to the manner in which contests and litigated cases growing out of ef forts to obtain government land are de termined. I concur in the opinion that the commissioner of the general land office should be relieved of this duty of deciding litigated land cases; that a non-partisan court should be created to pass on such cases and that decis ions of this court should be final, at least so far as the decisions of the department are final. I am convinced that the proper solution of the Indian problem and the success of every step t3ken in that direction depends, to a very large extent, upon the intelligence and honesty of the reservation agents and the interest they have In their work. An unfit agent will make no effort to advance the Indians on his reserva tion toward civilization or preparation for al lotment of lands In severalty, and his opinion as to their condition in this and other regards is heedless and valueless. The intelligent Indian school management of the past year has been fallowed by gratify ing results. Efforts have been made to ad vance the work in a sound and practical man ner. The appropriation for the current year ending June 3). 133S, applicable to the ordinary expenses of the Indian service, amounts to $6,733,033 18, being less by $663,243.04 than the sum appropriated on the same account the previous year. At the close of the last fiscal year, on the 39th day of June, 1S94, there were 969.514 per sons on the pension rolls, being a net increase of 3,53i over the number reported at the end of the previous year. These pensioners may be classified as follows: . Soldiers and sailors, survivors of all wars, 753,568; widows and rela tives of deceased soldiers, 215.155; army nurses in war of the rebellion, 414. Of these pension ers, 32,033 are surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars prior to the late civil war and the widows and relatives of such soldiers. The remainder, numbering 637,505, are re ceiving pensions on account of the war of tha rebellion, and of these 439,344 are on the rolls under the authority of the act of June 27, 1S90, sometimes called the dependent pension law. The total amount expended for pensions dur ing the year was $139,804,431.05, leaving an un expected balance from the sum appropriated of $25,205,712.6.1. The sum necessary to meet pension expenditures for the year ending J una 30, 1S93, is estimated at $140,000,003. Tha commissioner of pensions is of the opinion, that the year 1895 being the thtrtieth after the close of the war of the rebellion must, according to sensible human calculation, see the highest limit of the pension roll, and that after that year it must begin to decline. The claims pending in the bureau have de creased to more than 9,000 during the year. A large proportion of the jaew claims filed are for increase of pension by those now on the rolls. The number of certificates issued was 80,213. The names dropped from the rolls for all causes during the year numbered 37,951. Among our pensioners are nine widows and three daughters of soldiers of the revolution, and forty-five survivors of the war of 1812. Agricultural Matters. The secretary of agriculture in his report re views the operations of - his department for the last fiscal year, and makes recommen dations for the further extension of its use fulness. He reports a saving in expenditures during the year of $003,030, which is covered back into the treasury. This sum is 23 per cent, of the entire appropriation, as special study has been mado of the demand for Amer ican farm product- in all foreign markets, es pecially in Great Britain. That country received from the United States during the nine months ending September 30. 1894, 305,901 live beef cattle, valued at $26.500,- 000 as against 182,611 cattle, valued at $16,634, 003 during the same period for 1893. During the first six months of 1S94 the United King dom took also 112,009,030 pounds of dressed beef from the United States valued at nearly $10,030,000. The report shows that during the nine months immediately preceding September 30,1891. tha United States exported to Great Britain 222. 676,000 pounds of pork, of apples 1.930,000 bushels, valued - at 72,500,000 and of horses 2,811 at an average value of $139 per head. There was a falling off in Amer ican wheat exports of 13,500,030 bushels and the secretary is inclined to believe that wheat may not in the future be the staple export cereal product of our country, but that corn will con tinue to advance in importance as an export on account' of the new uses to which it is con stantly being appropriated. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June SO, 1894, amount ed to $628,363,033. being 72.28 per cent, of Amer ican exports of every description, and tha United Kingdom of Great Britain took more than 54 per cent, of all farm products finding foreign markets. The Civil Service. The advantages to the public servico of an adherence to the principles of civil service re form are constantly more apparent and noth ing is so encouraging to those in official life who honestly desire good government as the in creasing appreciation by our people cf these advantages, a vast majority of the voters of the land are ready to insist that the time and the attention of those they select to perform for them important public duties, should, not be distributed by doling out minor offices and they are growing to be unanlnjus in regarding party organization as something that should be used in establishing party principles instead of dictating the distribution of public places as rewards of partisan activity. Numerous addi tional offices and places have lately been brought within civil service rules and regula tions, and some others will probably be In cluded. The report of the commissioners will be submitted to the congress, and I invite care ful attention to the recommendations It con tains. A Board of Health. I am entirely convinced that we ought not to be longer without a national board of health or national health officer charged with no other duties than such as pertain to the protection of our country from the invasion of pestilence and disease. This would involve the establish ment by such board or officer of proper quaran tine precautions of the necessary aid and coun sel to locate authorities on the subject, prompt advice and assistance to local boards of health or health officers in the suppression of con tagious disease and in cases where there are no such local boards. The Labor Commission. By virtue of a statute of the United States, passed in 1838, 1 appointed in July last Hon. J. D. Keen, of the state of New York, and Hon. Nicholas E. Worthlngton, of the state of Illi nois, to form with Hon. Carroll D. Wright, com missioner of labor, who was designated by said statute a commission for the purpose of mak ing careful inquiry into the causes of the con troversies between certain railroads and their employes which had resulted In an extensive and destructive strike, accompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance with con siderable loss of life and great destruction of property. The report of the commissioners has been submitted to me and will be trans mitted to congress with the evidence taken upon their investigation. The Tariff. The tariff act passed at the last session of congress needs important amendments if it is executed effectively and with certainty. In addition to such necessary amendments as will not change rates of duty, I am still very de cidedly in favor of putting coal and Iron on the free list. So far as the sugar schedule is con cerned, I would be glad, under existing azgra tions, to see every particle of differen tial duty in favor of refined sugar stricken out of our tariff law. I earnestly repeat here the recommendation I have made in another portion of this commu nication, that the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent p?r pound laid upon sugar imported from foreign countries paying a bounty on its export be abrogated. It seems to me that ex- -ceedlngly important considerations point to the propriety of this amendment. 'With tha advent f a new tariff policy not only contem plated to relieve the consumers of our land in the cost of their dally life, but to Invite a bet ter development of American thrift, and create for us closer and more profitable commercial re lations with the rest of the world, it follows as a logical and imperative necessity that we should at once remove the chief, if not only, obstacle which has long prevented our participation in the foreign carrying trade of the sea. Tho ancient provision of our law denying American registry to ships built abroad and owned by Americans appears. In the light of present conditions, not only to be a failure for good at every point, but to be nearer a relic of barbar ism than anything that exists under the per mission of statute of the United States. X earnestly recommend its prompt repeal. . The Bond Issue. During the last month the gold reserves in the treasury for the purpose of redeeming tha notes of the government circulating as money in the hands of the people became so reduced, and Its further depletion in the near future seemed so certain, that in the exercise of proper care for the public welfare it became necessary to replenish this reserve and thus maintain popular faith In the ability and de termination of the government to meet, as agreed, its pecuniary obligations. It would
