Fellow Citizens of the Senate and Home of Representatives: I congratulate yon on the continued and increasing prosperity of onr country. By the favor of Divine Providence we have becu blessed during the past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profit able employment for all our people and with contentment at homo and friendship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election of achief magistrate has afforded another oppor tunity to the people of the United States to ex hibit to tbe world a significant example of the transmission of the power and authority of (he government from pnblie servants, whose terms of office are about to expire, to their newly chosen suc cessors. This example cannot fail to impress profoundly the thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which republi can institutions afford. The immediate, gen eral and cheeif ul acquiescence of all good citi sens in the result of the election gives gratify ing assurance to our country and its friends thronghont the world that the government based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses elements of strength, stability aud permanency, not found in any other form of government. SUFCTAOE. Continued opposition to the fall and free en joyment of tbe rights of citizenship conferred upon colored people by the recent amendments to the constitution, still prevails in several of tbe late slave-holding States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the recent eleetion to any large extent by acta of violence or intimi dation. It has, however, by fraudulent prac tices in connection with ballots, with regula tions as to the places and manner of voting and with counting the returns and canvassing ihe votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all rights, tbe right of suffrage, which tbe consti tution expressly confers upon our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a fact or in politics should disappear. They prefer that no section of the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse prompt and hearty obedience to the eqnal rights amendments to the consti tution is all that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disre garded it is safe to assume that tbe people who placed them in the constitution as embodying the legitimate results of tbe war for the Un ion, who believe them to be wise and neces sary, will continue to net together and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The parmount question, still is as to the enjoyment of the right by every American eitizen who has tbe requisite qalifi cations to freely cast his vote, and have it hon estly counted. With this question rightly set tled the country will be assured the conten tions of past bygones will indeed be by gones, and political and party issues with re spect to economy and efficiency of administra tion, internal improvements, the tariff, uuines tic taxation, education, finance and other im jtortant subjects will then receive their full snare of attention. But resistance to and nullification of the results of the war will unite together in resolute purpose for their support, all who maintain tbe authority of the government and the perpetuity of the Union and who adequately appreciate the value of tbe victory achieved. This deter mination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of our country, or to any of their interests. Tbe inviolability of the amendments rest upon the fundamental principles of onr govern ment. They are Ihe soiemn expressions of tbe will of the leople of the United States. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all onr citi zens must be maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control tbe government of the country. Happily, tbe history of the late election shows that in many parts of the coun try where opposition to the fifteenth amend ment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminish ing, and is likely to cease altogether if firm and w«)ll considered action is taken by Congress. I trust tbe Home of Representatives and tbe Senate, which have the right to jndge of tbe elections, returns and qualifications of their own members, will see 1 it that every case of violation of tbe letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thorough ly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the executive, with suf ficient appropriations, for the purpose, to prose cute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. It is not,however,to be forgotten that the best and surest guarantee of the primary righto of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self-protection, which can only belong to a peo ple whose right to universal suffrage is sup pt.rted by personal education. The resources at the command of local and State anthorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is (specially true, where before emancipation the education of the peoole was neglected or pre vented in tbe interests of slavery. I am firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of this country, with a view to wise and compre hensive action by tbe government of the United States. I respectfully recommend that Congress by suitable legisla tion and with proper regulations supplement the local educational funds in tbe several States where the grave duties and responsibili ties of citizenship bave been devolved on un educated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and if necessary, by appropriations from the treasury of the United State* what else the government can fairly do to pronibte free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general education is found peace, virtue and social order prevail and civil and religious liberty are secured. OITIL 8EBVICE HEFORM. In my former annnal messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent neces sity of a reformation of the civil service sys tem of tbe government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage or appointment for personal or Dartisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and expe rience in the executive ofiice.and I believe these dangers threaten the stability of the govern ment. Abuses so serious in their nature can not be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of the administrative service, as the growth of the country in population increases the num ber of officers and placemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promotions and removals by establishing a uniform method having exclusively in view in every instance the attainment of best quali fications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens and tbe most economical and ef ficient administration of the public business. Competitive examinations in aid of impartial appointments and promotions bave been con ducted for some years past in several of tbe executive departments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in the custom houses and postoffioes of tbe larger cities of tbe country. In New York city over 2,000 po sitions in tbe jivil service have been subject in their appointments and tenure of place to the operations of the published rules for this purpose the past two years. The results of these practical trials have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of the system of selection. All arc subjected to the same tests and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It se cures for the position applied for the best qualifications attainable among the competing applicants. It is an effectual protection from tbe pressure of importunity, which, under any other course punned, largely exacts the time and attention of appointing officers, to their great detriment in the discharge of other official duties. It prevents the abuse of the servioe for the mere urtberenee of private or party purposes and leaves tbe employe of tbe government, freed from tbe obligations imposed by patronage, to depend solely on merit for retention and advancement, and with this constant incentive to advancement and improvement. These invaluable results bave been attained in a high degree in the offices 

VOLUME IX. where tbe rules for appointment by competi tive examination have been applied. As shown by experimental trial it may be fairly considered conclusive that toe system should be extended to ail subordinate positions under the government. I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing and enforcing the highest positive efficiency in the eivil service and its protection from recognized abases, and that tbe experience referred to has demon strated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in eoatom houses and postoflises bave been held under many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor performed by the officers who bave conducted them, and whose commendable interest in improvement of the public servise has tndueed this devotion of time and tabor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to be ex pected, and without an- appropriation by Congress for compensation it is not practicable to extend tbe system of examination thronghont tbo civil servioe. It is highly important that all such examination* should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general supervision. Section 1,753 of the revised statutes authorizes tbe President to prescribe the regulations for admission to tbe eivil service of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to con sider the requisite inquiries with reference to the fitness of each candidate in respect to age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the branch of service into which be seeks to enter, but the law is practically inoperative for the want of requisite appropriations. Therefore, I recommend an ap propriation of 936,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a commission to be appointed by the President, in accordance with the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and efficient sjstem of competitive examination and to su pervise the application of the same throngh ont the entire eivil service of the government. I an) persuaded that tbe facilities which such a commission will afford for testing tbe fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members of Con gress ss it will be to the President and heads of departments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment which now inevitably and con stantly attend the conflicting claims of patron age between the legislative and executive de partments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of influence and offi cial favoritism in tbe bestowal of office, will be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the applicants, in which every one can make his own record with tbe assurance that bis success will depend upon this alone. I also recommend such legislation, as, while leaving every officer free as any other citizen to express his political opinions, and to use his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen in re fusing demands on bis salary for political pur poses. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise contain string ent provisions against the use of official author ity to coerce the political action of private cit izens or of official subordinates, is greatly to bo desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of civil service, and especially to a reform in the methed of appointment and removal, has beea found to be' tbe practice un der what is known as the spoils system, by which the appointing power has been so largely encroached on by members of Congress. The first step in the reform of the civil setvice must be a complete divorce between Congress and the executive in the matter of appointments. Tbe corrupting doctrine that "to the victor belong the spoils" is inseparable from Congres sional patronage. As the established rule and practice of p*rH-= t- r^wer it comes to be un derstood by a,,,,. ^. oilioes and by the people generally that Representatives and Sen ators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts and States. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this perversion of the executive func tions. The true principles of government on the subject of appointments to office, as stated in the national conventions of the leading par ties of tbe country, bave again and again been approved by the American people and have not been called in question in any quarter These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all important subject are the state ment of principles that belong to the consti tutional structure of the government. Under the constitution, the President and heads of departments are to make nominations for of fice, the Senate is to confirm the appointments and the House of Representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best interest of tbe public service demands that these distinctions be respected, and that Sens tors and Representatives who may be jndges and accusers should not dictate appointments to office. To this end the cooperation of tbo legislative department of the government is required, alike by the necessities of tbo esse and by public opinion. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the demands made. upon them with reference to appointments to office until by legislative enactment tbe per nicious practice is condemned and ferbidden. It is, therefore, recommended that an act be passed defining tbe re lations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to office by tbe President, and I also recommend that tbe provisions of section 1767 and of tbe sections following of the revised statutes, comprising the term-of-office act of March 3, 1«67, be re pealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our coun try is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship and that it can be permanently done only by the co-operation of the legislative and exeentive depart ments of the government, I again commend the whole subject to your considerate atten tion. 

POLYGAMY. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress poly gamy where it now exists in Utah Territory and to prevent its extension. Fai tbf ul and zealous efforts have been made by the United States officers in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed tbe more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy, has the whole power of making and executing tbe local legislation of tbe Territory. By its control of the grand and petit jurors it poetesses large influence over the administration of jus tice. Exercising, as the beads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to tbe laws of Congress or.jthe subject of polygamy and in fact do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of law depends those who practice and up hold the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The powers of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not a case for balf-way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous Ter ritories. It is extending steadily into other Territories. Wherever it goes it estab lishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and family relations arc the corner stones of American society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separ ation of church and state are among the ele mentary ideas of free institutions. To re-es tablish the interests and principles which po lygamy and Mormonism have imperilled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous im migrants of all other creeds the Territory closed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral institutions, it is recommended that the government of tbe Territory of Utah should be reorganized. I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a governor and judges or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate—a government analogeons to tbo provisional government established for tbe territory northwest of Ohio by the ordinance of 17S7. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing local form of government I recommend that the right to vote, bold office and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygomv. If thorough measures are adopted it is believed that within a few years the evils which dow afflict Utah will be eradicated, and this Terri tory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new States of the Union. FOREIGN SEDATION*. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace and have pre sented no occasion for concern as to their con tinued meuintenanee. My anticipation of an early reply from tbe British government to the demand of indemnity to our fishermen for injuries suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay in January, 1878, which I expressed in my last annual message, waa disappointed. This answer waa received only in the latter The Worthingto part of April in the present year, and when received exhibited a failure of accord between the two governments as to the measure of the inshore fishing privileges secured to onr fisher men by the treaty of Washington, of so serious a character that I made it tbe subject of a communication to Congress in whioh I recommended the adoption of meas ures which seemed to m* proper to be taken by this government in maintenance of tbe rights scctrded to our fishermen under tbe treaty and toward securing an indemnity for tbe injury these interests had suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations waa under consideration by the Hones of Rep resentatives at the time of the adjournment of Congress in June lsst. Within a few weeks I bave received a com munication from her majesty's government re viewing the consideration of itbe subject, both of tbe indemnity for injuries at Fortune Bay and of the interpretation of the treaty, in which tbe previous correspondence bad shown the two governments to be at variance. Upon both these topics tbo disposition towards a friendly agreement is manifested by a leoognition of oor right to an indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indemnity to further confer ence and by an assent to the views of this gov ernment, ptesented in a previous correspond ence, that tbe regulation of conflicting inter ests of th*shore fishing of ihe provincial sea coasts and the vessel fishing of our fishermen should he made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two gov ernments. I sincerely hope that tbe basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of tbe very serious divergence of views in the inter pretation of the fishery clause of the treaty of Washington, wbioh, as tbe correspond ence between the two governments stood at the oloae of the last session of Con gress seemed to be irreconcilable. In the important exhibition of arts and in dustries whioh waa held last year at Sydney, New South Wales, as well as in that now in progress at Melbourne, tbe United States have been efficiently and honorably represented. The exhibitors from this country at tbe former place received a large number of awards in some of tbe most considerable departments, and the participation of the United States was recognized by a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our country is no less notable, and an equal degree cf success is confidently expected. The state of peace and tranquility now en joyed by all tbe nations of the continent of Europe has its favorable influence upon our diplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have concluded and ratified a convention with the French republic for settlement of the claims of citizens of either country against the other. Under this convention, a commission, presided over by a distinguished publicist, ap pointed in pursuance of the request of both nations by his majesty tbe emperor of Brazil, has been organized and has begun its sessions in this city. A Congress to consider means for the protec tion of industrial prosperity has recently been in session in Paris, to Which I have appointed the ministers of the United Btates in France and Belgium as delegates. The constitutional commissions npon weights and measures also continues its work in Paris. I invite your atten tion to tbe necessity of appropriations to be made in time to enable this government to ful fill its obligations under the metrical conven tion. Our friendly relations with tbe German em pire continue without interruption. At tbe recent international exhibition of fish and fisheries at Berlin the participation of the United States, notwithstanding tbe haste in which the commission wss forced to make preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning private exhibitors nu merous awards of high class, and for the coun try at large, the principal prize of honor offered by bis msjesty the emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this important and growing industry. There have been some questions raised between tbe two governments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of nat uralization, but recent dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that favorable progress is making toward au understanding in accordance with the views of this govern ment, which makes and admits no distinction whatever between tbe rights of a native and a naturalization citizen of tbe United States. In practice tbe complaints of molestations suf fered by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer. There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relations with the govern ments of Austria, Hungary, Russia, Portugal, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. During the last summer several vessels be longing to the merchant marine of this conn try sailing in natural waters of the West Indies were fired at, boarded and searched by an armed cruiser of the Span ish government. The sircumstances, as reported, involve not only private injury to tbe persons concerned, but also seemed too little observant of tbe friendly relations exist ing for a century between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to tlae atten tion of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royal authori ties, with a view to such explanation or repara tion as may be called for by the facts. The commission sitting in this city for the adjudi cation of claims of oar citizens against the government of Spain is, 1 hope, approaching the termination of its labors. Tbe claims against the United Btates under the Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to Congress for its action at tbe late session. I again invite vour attention to this long stand ing question, with a view to a disposition of the matter. At invitation of the Spanish government a conference has recently been held at the city of Madrid to Consider the subject of protection by foreign powers of native Moors in the em pire of Morocco. Ihe minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part in the deliberations of this conference, the result of whioh is a convention signed ou behalf of tbe powers represented. Tbe instrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. The government of tbe United States has also lost no opportunity to urge upon that of tbe emperor of Morocco the necessity, in accord ance with the humane and established spirit of the age, of putting an end to tbe persecu tions which have been so potent in that conn try of persons of a faith other than Moslem and especially of Hebrew residents of Mo rocco. The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not been yet officially promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by tbe Senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowed for ratification expired. The Senate will be asked to extend the neriod for ratification. The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra dition with Denmark failed, on account of the objection of the Danish government to the clause providing that cash nation should pay the expense of tbe arrest of persons whose ex tradition it makes. The provision made by Congress at its last session for the expense of the commission whieh had been appointed to enter upon nego tiations with the imperial government of China, on a subject of great interest to tbe two countries, enabled the commissioners to proceed at once npon their mission. The imperial government waa prepared to give prompt and respectable attention to the matters brought nnder negotiation and the conferences proceed ed with such rapidity and success that on tbe 17th of November last iwo treaties were signed at Pektn, one relating to the introduetion of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Tresoott, one of the commis sioters, is now on bis Way, bringing the treat ies audit is expected that they will be receiv ed in time to be laid before the Senate early in January. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a con vention|for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked persons. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress tbe propriety of making provisions for the erection of suitable fire proof buildings at tbo Japanese capital for the use of tbe American legation and the court house and jail connected with it. The Japanese government with great generosi ty aud courtesy has offered for tbe purpose an eligible piece of land. In my last annnal message I invited the at tention of Congress to the subject of the in demnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. I renew the recommenda tion then made that whatever portions of these fnnds are due to American citizens should be promptly psid and tbe residue re turned to the nations respectively to which they justly and equitably belong. Tbe extradition treaty with the kingdom of the Netherlands, whieh has been for some time in course of negotiation, has, during tbe past year, been concluded and duly ratified. Relatione of friendship and amity have been established between the government of the United States and that of Roumania. We have sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest and have received at this capital the special envoy, who has been charged by His Royal Highness Prince Charles, to announce the in dependent sovereignty of Roumania, and we hope for a speedy development of commercial relations between the two countries. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet on the border between this country and Mexico, would soon become so assured as to justify the modifica tion of tbe orders then in force, to our mili tary commanders in regard to crossing the frontier, without encouraging such distur bances as would endanger tbe peace of the two countries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations aud the orders were accord ingly withdrawn to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the Mexican government. Subsequently tbe peace of the border was again disturbed by a savage foray nnder the command of the Chief Victoria, but by the con tinued and harmonious action of the military forces of both countries, bis band has been broken and substantially destroyed. There is reason to believe that the obstacles which bave so long prevented rapid and convenient com munication between the United States and Mexico by railways are on the point of disap pearing and that several important enterprises of this character will soon be set on foot, wbioh can not fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries. New envoys from Gutamala, Colombia, Bolivia,Venezuela and Nicuragua have recently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and enlightenment afford the best guarantee of the continuance of friendly relatione between our selves and these sister Republics. „._ 

INTEB-OCEANIC CANAL. Tbe relations between this government and that of tbe United States of Columbia have en gaged public attention during the past year, mainly by reason of tha project of an inter oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama to be built by private capital, nnder a concession rom tbe Columbian government for that pur pose. The treaty obligations subsisting be tween tbe United Btates of Columbia and the United States, by which we guarantee the nutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Columbia in the Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under wbioh so stupendous a change in ihe region embraced in this guar antee should be effected—transforming, as it would, this isthmus from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, for the navies and merchant ships of tbe world—should receive tbe approval of this government, as being com patible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests as the principal com mercial pjwer of the western hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a special mes sage to Congress in March last, in relation to this project, I deem it my dnty again to press on your attention. Subsequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion that it is the right and dnty of the United States to assert and maintain auch aupervision and authority over any interooeanic canal across the Isthmus that connects North and 8outh America, and as wall protect onr national interest. The war between the republic of Chilli on the one hand and the allied republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other still continues. This government has not felt called on to inter fere in a contest that is within the belligerent righto of the parties as independent States. We have, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommodating their differ ence and bave at different times reminded both belligerents of onr willingness to render such nervices. Our good officers in his direction were recently accepted by all the belligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious. But I regret to announce that the measures which the ministers of tbe United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not successful. In the course of the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights. In all of these the ministers of tbe United States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and energy in protec tion of American interests. The relations of the United States with the empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily in creases, to their mutual advantage. Tbe internal disorders with which the Argen tine Republic has for borne time past been afflicted, and wbicb bave, more or less, influ enced its external trade, arc understood to have been brought to a close. This happy result may be expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign commerce of that republic, as well as to the development of its vast interior re sources. In Samoa the government of King Malietoa under the support and recognition of the con sular repesentatives of the United States.Great Britain and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquility to tbe islands. While it does not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of a tripartite local government which has been proposed, the .common in terests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in their true relations to the native frame of government and this may bo best secured by a simple diplomatic agreement be tween them. It would be well if the consular jurisdiction of our representative at Topia were increased in extent and importance, so as to guard American interests in the surrounding and outlying islands of Oceanica. The obelisk generously presented by the khedive of Egypt to tbe city of New York has ssfely arrived in this country, and will soon be erected in that metropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and tbis government at the earnest solicitation of the khedive has acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will be laid before Congress for its information. A commission for tbe revision of tbe judicial code of the reform tribunalfof Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman, consul general, and J. M. Batchclder, Esq., have been appoint ed as commissioners to participate in this work. Tbe organization of the reform tribunals will probably be continned for another period of five years. SANITABY CONFERENCE. In pursuance of tbe act passed at the last session of Congress, invitations have been ex tended to foreign maritime status to join in a sanitary conference in Washington, beginning tbe 1st of January. The acceptance of this in vitation by many prominent powers gives promise of success in this important measure designed to establish a system of international notification by which tbe spread of infections or epidemic diseases may be more effectively counteracted or prevented. The attention of Congress is invited to tbe necessary appropria tions for carrying into effect the provisions of the act referred to. OUR COMMERCE. The efforts of tbe department of state to en large the trade and commerce of the United States through the active agency of consular officers and through the dissemination of in formation obtained from them, bave been an re laxed. The interest in these efforts, aa developed in our commercial com munities and the value of the in formation secured by tbis means to the trade and manufacturers of the country, were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made for the more frequent publication of consular and other reports by tbe department of state. The first issue of this publication has now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected. The importance and interest attached to the reports of consular officers are witnessed by the general demand for tham by all classes of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed that tbe system of such publication is deserving of tbe ap proval of Congress and that tbe necessity of appropriations for its continuance and en largement will commend itself to your con sideration. The pursuit of domestic indnstrious and their immense production of subjects of for eign commerce invite and even require an active development of the wishes and inter ests of our people in that direction. Espec ially important is it that our commercial rela tions with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and tbe Gulf of Mexico, should be direct and not not through a circuit of the European systems, and should be carried on iu our own bottoms. Tbo full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on tbe Pacific ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East In dies, with Australia and the island groups which belong to these routes of navigation, should inspireequal efforts to appro2 riate to our own interest and administer to our own capital due portion of this trade. Whatever modification of our method-of trade and navi gation may be necessary or useful to meet and direct to the enlargement of onr exchange and our carrying interest, I am sure members of Goneress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly use ful and efficient tbat I venture to press it upon your earliest attention. It seems to be very evident tbat the provision of regular steam post communication by aid from governments baa been tbe forerunner of the commercial prominence of Great Britain in all the sea coasts, and these coasts and seas, a greater share of whose trade is now ths desire and in tent of our people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other European nations to con tend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce has been successful in •roportion to their adoption of regular steam postal com' FREE THOUHGT, FREE SPEECH AND A FREE PRESS. WORTHINGTON, NOBLES COUNTY, MINNESOTA, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1880. monication with the markets whose trade they sought Mexico and the states of South America are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country and to aid in their development. Similar co-operation stay be looked for in due time from the east ern nations and from Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead in that movement can be expected from private inter ests in respect of foreign commerce. Quite aa much,, an ^national trade postal communication seems sosssariiy a matter of common and public administration, and thus pertaining to the government. I re spectfully recommend to your prompt atten tion snob just and efficient measures ss may conduce to the development of our foreign commercial exehanges, and the building up of onr carrying trade. In this connection 1 desire also to suggest *be very great service which might be expected in enlarging and facilitating our commerce un the Pacific ocean were a transmarine cable laid from Ban Francisco to tbe Bandwieh Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great influence of sueh means of communication on these routes of navigation in developing and securing the due share of our Pacific coast in the eommeroe of the world, needs no interpretation or en forcement. It may be that such an enterprise is useful and in the end profitable, as it would prove to private investmsnt, may need to be &8&miU& by prudent legislation by Congress in Us aid, and I submit the matter to your careful consideration. An additional and not unimportant although secondary reason for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in the unquestionable servioe to the expansion of our commerce, which would be rendered by the frequent cir culation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe.

Our merchants at home and abroad recognise the value to foreign commerce of an I active movement of our na val vessels, and tbe intelligence and patriotic zeal of onr naval officers in promoting every in terest of their countrymen is a just subject of natural pride. THE FINANCES. The condition of the financial affairs of the government, as shown by tbe report of tbe secretary of the treasury, is very satisfactory. It is believed that the present financial situa tion of the United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and variety of our re sources, is more favorable than tbat of any other country of onr time, and |bas never been surpassed by any other country at any period of its his tory. All our industries are thriving. The rate of interest is low new railroads are being constructed a vast immigration is increasing our population, capital and labor new enter prises in great number arein progress, and our commercial relations with other countries are improving. The ordinary revenues, from all sources, for the fiscal year ended June 3d, 1880, were: Erom customs #186,532,064 60 From internal revenue 124,009,373 93 From sales of publio lands 1,016,506 60 From tax on circulation and de posits of national banks 7,014,971 44 From repayment of interest by Pacific railway companies... 1,707,367 18 From sinking fund for Pacific railway companies 786,621 22 Frm customs fees, fined, pen alties, etc J.148,800 16 From fees—consular, letters patent and lands 2,337,029 00 From proceeds of sales of gov ernment property 282,616 66 From profits on coinage, etc.... 2,792,186 78 From revenues of the District of Columbia 1,809,469 70 From miscellaneous sources.... 4,099,603 88 Total ordinary receipts 9333,526,610 98 The ordinary expenditures for the same peri od were: For civil expenses $ 15,693,963 55 For foreign intercourse 1,211,490 58 For Indians 5,945,457 09 For pennons, including $19,341, 025.20 arrears of pensions.... 56,777,174 44 For the military establishment, including river and harbor improvements and arsenals.. 39,116,916 33 For tbe naval establishment, in cluding vessels, machinery, and improvements at navy yards 13,536,984 74 For miscellaneous expenditures, including publio buildings, lighthouses, and collecting tbe revenue 34,535,691 00 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 3,272,384 63 For interest on the public debt. 95,757,575 11 For premjum on bonds pur chased 3,795,320 42 Total ordinary expenditures.. $267,642,957 78 Leaving a surplus revenue of. .$ 65,883,653 20 Which, with an amount drawn from cash balance in treas ury, of 8,084,434 21 Making $73,968,087 41 Was applied to the redemption— Of bonds for the sinking fund.. 73,652,900 00 Of fractional currency for the sinking lund 251,717 41 Of the loan of 1858 40.0C0 00 Of temporary loan 100 00 Of bounty land scrip 25 00 Of compound-interest notes. 16.500 00 Of 7.30 notes of 1864-'5 2,650 00 Of one and two year notes 3,700 00 Of old demand notes 495 00 Total $73,968,087 41 The amount due the sinking fund for this year was $37,931,643.55. There waa applied thereto tbe sum of $73,904,617.41, being $35,982,972.86, an excess of the actual requirements for the year. Tne aggregate of revenues from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30,1880, waa $333,526,610.98, au increase over the preceeding year of $59 699,426.52. Thereoeiota thus far of the current ear together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to $330,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet tbe eetimated expenditures of the year, and leave a surplus of $90,000,000. It is fortnnate tbat tbis large surplus of rev enues occurs at a period when it may be ap plied to tbe payment of tbe pnblie debt soon redeemable. No public duty baa been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as rapid ly as possible. Tbe debt of the United States, less cash in the treasury, and exclusive of accruing interest, attained its maximum of $2,756,431,571.43 in August, 1865, and Has since been reduced to $1,890,025,740.89, tbe princi pal of the debt $108,755,100 has been raid since March 1st. 1877, effecting an annual sav ing of six to seven millions. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest, and the application of the proceeds in redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. Tbe annnal saving thus se cured since March 1st, 1877, is $14,290,453.50. Within a short period over six hundred mil lions of five and six per cent, bonds will be come redeemable. This presents a very favor able opportunity not only to reduce the prin cipal of the debt, bnt also to reduce tbe rate of interest on tbat which will remain unpaid. 1 call the attention of Congress to the views eznreised on this subject by the secretary of the treasury in bis annnal report, and recom mend prompt legislation to enable tbe treasury department to complete the refunding of tbe debt which is about to mature. The continuance of specie payment has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to tbe revival of business and to our remarkable prosperity, The fears that precededed and ac companied resumption have proved ground less. No considsrable amount of United States nates have been presented for redemption, while very Urge sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to tbe mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1st, 1879, is estimated at $227,899,428. There are still in existence, unoonceled, $346,281,016 of the United Btates legal tender notes. These notes were authorised as a war measure made necessary by the ex igenoies of the conflict in whioh the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's existence required, iu the judg ment of Congress, an issue of legal tender paper money. That it served well the purpose for whieh it was created,!* not questioned, bnt tbe employment of the notes as paper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of tbe object for whieh they were provided, wss not contemplated by the fremers of the law nnder whieh they were issued. These notes long since became like any other pecuniary obliga tion of the government, a debt to be paid, and when paid to be oaneetad ae snare evidence of an indebtedness no longer existing. I 1 fore repeat what wss said in ihe annnal 5 .°i ^.W' from circulation of United Btates notes, wish the capacity of legal toodor in private contracts, is a step to be taken in oar progress towards a be safe and stable currency,.whichshould whieh should be oepted as tbe policy aududuty of the gov mentaad the interest and security of the people. At the time of the passage of the set now in force requiring the coinage of silver dollars, fixing their value sad giving them a legal ten der character, N W SS believed by away sap porters of tbe measure that the aUver dollar whieh it authorised would speedily hoscsao, under tbe operations of the law, of equivalent value to tbe gold dollar. There were other supporters of tbe bill who, while they doubted as to the probability of this result, ntiTertholam were willing to give tbo propose! experiment a fair trial with a view to atop tbe coinage if experience should prove the silver dol lar authorised by the bill continned to be of leas commercial value than the stan dard gold dollar. The entnasn of silver dollars nnder the act referred to began in March, 1878. aad has beea continued as requir ed by tbe act. The average rate per month to the present time has bean $2,276,492. The total amount eoinad prior to the 1st of Novem- W 7 5 0 OftUsaatoantttV 084,450 remains in the treasury aad only $26, 768,291 are la the bands of the people. A con stent effort has been made to keep th:s curren cy in circulation and considerable expense baa been necessarily incurred for this purpose: but its return to the treasury is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation of the friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dollar containing 412V grains of silver baa not inoreased. During tbe year prior to the passsge of tbe bill authorising its coinage tbe market value of the silver whieh it contained was from ninety to ninety-two cents, as compared with tbe stand ard gold dollar. During the last year the aver age market value of the silver dollar has been eighty eight and one-half cents. It is obvi ous tbat tbe legislation of tbe last Congress in regard to silver so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of silver as a result of that legislation,!!** failed to produce the effect then predicted. Tbe longer tbe law remains in force requiring as it does the coinage of a nom inal dollar,wbioh in reality is not a dollar, the country real a standard of less value than it purportsm to be worth in the reoognised money of the world. The constitution of the United States, sound financial principles, and our best interests all require that the country should have as its legal tender money both gold and silver coin ofaa intrinsic value as bullion, equivalent to that whieh npon its face it purports to possess. The constitution in express terms recognises both gold and silver ss the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from onr curren cy is to narrow or limit the circulating medi um of exchange to the disparagement of im portant interests. The United Btates produces more silver thin any other country and is di rectly interested in maintaining itss one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world. It will in my judgment contribute to this result if Congress will re peal so much of the existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars containing only 412K grains of silver, and in its stead will authorise the secretary of the treasury to coin silver dollars of equiva lent value as bullion with gold dollars. This will defraud no man and will be in aooordanoe with familiar precedents. Congress, on sev eral occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to es tablish it mere nearly in accordance with tbe actual rate of value between the two metals. In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found by ex perienoe to determine the rate of interest debt ors have to pay and to increase tbe facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely money becomes abundant whenever confidence in the exact Sshed. arforaanes of moneyed obligations is estab- THC WAB 

DEPARTMENT. Tbe secretary of war reports that the expen. ditnresoftbe war department for the fiscal year ended Jnne 30,1880, were $39,924,773.03. The appropriations for this department for the ervice year amount to $41,993,630.40. With aspect to tbe army the secretary invites atten tion to the fact that its strength is limited by section 116, revised statute 19, to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, but that a proviso con tained in the appropriation bills have limited the expenditures to the enlistment of but 25, 000. It is believed the full legal strength is tbe least possible force at wbioh the present organisation can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and economy. While tbe enlistment of tbis force would add somewhat to tbe appropriation for pay of tbe army, tbe saving made in other respects would be more than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be greatly increased. Tbe rapid extension of the railroad aytern of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and tbe great tide of emigration which has flowed in on new territory has imposed on tbe military an entirely new change of policy. The estab lishment of posts along wagon roads and roads frequently traveled is no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selected of a more substantial character than those hereto fore constructed will be required. Under ex isting lawa permanent buildings cannot be erected without the aenotion of Congress, and when sales of military sites and buildings have been authorised the moneys received have reverted to tbe treasury and could only become available through anew appropriation. It is recommended that provisions be msde by a general statute for tbe sale of sueh aban doned military posts and buildings as are found to be unnecessary, and for the applica tion of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts are of bnt slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed conditions of the coun try, their occupation is continned at great ex pense and inconvenience because they afford Uje only available shelter for the troops. ABSENT OmCEBS. The absence of a large number of officers of the line in active dnty from their regiments is a serious detriment to tbe maintenance of tbe service. The constant demand for small detachments, each of whieh should be com manded by a commissioned officer, and tbe various details of officers for necessary service away from their commands, oooasions a scarc ity in the number required for company duty. Witb a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law author izing the detail of officers from the sotive list as professors of tactics and military science at certain colleges and universities, be so amend ed as to provide that all suoh details be msde from the retired list of the army. THE MILITIA. Attention is asked to the necessity of pro viding by legislation for organizing, arming, and disciplining tbe active militia of the coun try, and liberal appropriations are reoem mended in this behalf. The reports of tbe ad jutant general of tbe army and the chief of ordnance touching this subject fully sst forth its importance. ABJfY SCHOOLS. The report of tbe officers in charge of educa tion iu the army shows that there are seventy eight schools now in operation in the army, with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 enlisted men and children. The secretary recommends tbe enlistment of 150 school masters, with the rsnk and pay of commissary sergeants. JUIXiE ADVOCATES. An appropriation is needed to supply tbe judge advocate of the army witb suitable [i braries, and tbe secretary recommends tbat the corps of judge advocates be plseed upon the same footing as to promotion with the oth er staff corps of tbe army. Under existing laws the bureau of military justice consists of one officer, the judge advocate general sad tbe corps of judge advocates, of eight officers of equal rank, majors, with a provision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four, when reduced by casualty or resignation to tbat number. The consolidation of the bureau of military justice and tbe corps of judge advo cates npon the same basis with the other staff corpa of the army would remove an un just discrimination against deserving officers aad subserve the best interests of the service. NATIONAL DEFENSES. Especial attention Is asked to the report of tbe chief of engineers upon tbe condition of our national defenses. From a personal in spection of many of the fortifications referred to, tbe secretary is able to emphasise the ree ommendstiens Madeand to state that their la- ^a''-A .vr^iy.. towards NUMBER 15. oondition is discred- complete aad defenseless1 eondi itablstothe cosurety.

Chair aavigabla waters wholly within the limits of the United States and are of vast importance to onr tateruel and foreign coat meros. Tbe persaesanwy^Tthe important work at the south pees of the unVsuunappi river seems to be assured.. There has bean no fail ure whatever ia the maintenance of the maxi mum ehaanel during the six months eudiaa August 9th, lsst. The experiment ass opened among people dally among the osmmaaltiss of tbe Mississip pi valley, whose commercial exchanges float iu an unobstructed channel safely to aad from the sea. A' comprehensive Improvement of tbe Mississippi and its tributaries is a matter of transcendent importance. These great waterways comprise system of inland nsportortetion. spread like a net work overs I argep tra of tbe United States and navigable to anextent of many thousand mile*. Producers and consumers alike have a common interest in such uneqalled faeilities for cheap transportation. Geograph ically, eommerclallv and politically they are the strongest tie between the various seetioas of tbe country. These channels of communi cation and interchange are the property of tbe nation. Its jurisdiction ia paramount over their waters and the plainest principles of public interest require their intelligent and careful supervision with a view to their pro tection, improvement and tbe enhancement of their usefulness. The channel of the Columbia river for a dis tance of about 100 miles from its mouth is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasions serious delays in navigation and heavy expenses for lightage and towage. A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide should be secured and maintained to meet tbe re quirements of the extensive and growing inland and ocean commerce it subserves. The urgent need, however, for this gseat water way is a permanent improvement of the chan nel nt the month of tbe river. From Columbia river to Ban Francisco, a diatanee of over 600 miles, there is no barber on our Pacific coast which can be approached during stormy weather. An ap propriation of $160,000 wss msde by the Forty, fifth Congress for tbe commencement of a back water and harbor of refuge, to be located at some point between the straits of Fueoa and Ban Franckoo, at whieh tbe necessities of eom meroe, local and general, will be best accom modated. Tbe amount appropriated is thought to be quite inadequate for tbe purpose intend ed. The cost of the work when finished will be great, owing to the want of natural ad vantages for a site at any point on tbe coast between tbe designated limits, and it has not been thought to be advisable to undertake tbe work without a larger appropriation. I com mend tbe matter to tbe attention of Congress. Tbe completion of the new building for tbe war department is urgently needed aud tbe estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended. The collection Of books, specimens and rec ords constituting the army medioal museum and library are of national im portance. Tbe library now contains about 31,500 volumes and 57,000 pamphlets, relating to medicine, surgery and subjests allied to physios. The contents of the army medical museum consist of 22,000 specimens and are unique in the completeness with whish both military surgery aad tbe diseases of armies an illustrated. Their destruction would be an irreparable loss, not only to the United States, but to tbe world. Then an filed in the record and pension division over 16,000 bound volumes of hospital records, to gether witb a great quantity of papen embrac ing the original records of the hospitals of our armies during the civil war. Aside from their historical value these records an daily searched for evidence needed ia tbe settlement of large number of pensions aad other claims and for the protection of the government against attempted fnnds as well as for the benefit of honest claimants- These valuable contents an now in a building whieh is peculiarly exposed to tbe danger of destruc tion by fire. Itisthenfo earnestly recom mended that an appropriation be made for a new fin proof building, adequate for tbe pres ent nerds and futum expansion of these valu able collections. Bach a building should be absolutely fin proof. No expenditure for men architectural display is required. It is believed tbat a suitable structure nan be erec ted nt a cost not to exeeed $25,000. GEN. GRANT. I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the commander-in-chief of our armies during the war, whose wise, firm and patriotic conduct did so much to bring tbat momentous conflict to a close. Tbe legisla tion of the United States contains many pre cedents for the recognition nf distinguished military merit, authorising rank aad emolu ments to be conferred for eminent services to tbe country. An set of Congress authorising the appointment of a captain general of the army, with suitable provisions nlating to com pensation, mtirement and other details, would, in my judgment, be altogether fitting and proper, and would be warmly approved by tbe country. TBE NAVY. The report of tbe secretary of the navy ex hibita the satisfactory management of that de partment during the last fiscal year. Tbe total expenditures for the year we $12,916,639.45, leaving unexpended at the close of tbe year $2,141,682.23 of the amount of available ap propriations. •The appropriations for tbe pres ent fiscal year ending Jnne 30,1881, an $15, 095,081.45, and tbe total estimates for tbe next fiscal year ending June 30, 1882, an $15,953, 751.61. The amount drawn by warrant from July 1,1880, to November 1, 1880, ia $5,041, 570.45. Tbe recommendation of tbe secretary of the navy that provision be made for the estab lishment of some form of civil government for tbe people of Alaska is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property in that territory except such as is afforded by the officers of the United Btates sbip James town. Tbis vessel was dispatched to Sitka be cause of the fear that without tb« immediate presence of tbe national authority then was impending danger of anarehy. Tbe ateps taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both white and Indian inhabitants, and tie necessity for this method of restraint doesnot in my opinion now exist. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdrawn, leaving the people ss at present without the or dinary judicial and administrative authority of local governments, serious eonse- 2ororganised uences might ensue. The laws provide only tbe collection of ravenous, the protection of public property and the transmission of the mails. The problem is to supply a local rule for a population so scattered and so peculiar in its origin and condition. Tbe natives an re ported to be teachable sad self-supporting, aad if properly instructed, doubtless would be add ed to the national life. I therefore recommend the requisite legislation upon tbis subject. The secretary of tbe navy has taken steps towards tbe establishment of naval coaling stations at the Isthmus of Paunatna to meet the requirements of our commercial relations with Central and South Ameriaa, whieh are rapidly growing in importance. Locations eminently suitable, both aa regards onr naval purposes and tbe uses of eommeroe, have been selected on tbe east side of the Isthmus, at Ohiriqui Lagoon, in the Oarribeaa Sea, and tbe other oa tbePaoifie coast at the Bay of Gal fito. The onlv safe harbors sufficiently commo dious on tbe Isthmus are at these points, and the distance between them is less than 100 miles. Tbe report of the secretary of tbe navy con cludes witb valuable suggestions with respect to the building up of our present marine ser vice, which deserve the favorable consideration of Congress. POSTAL MATXBBS. The report of tbe postmaster general ex hibits the continual growth and the high state of efficiency of tbe postal service. The opera tions of no department of tbe government, perhaps, ropreseat with greater exactness tbe increase in tbe population aad business of tbe country. In 1860 the petal receipts we $8,518,067.40. In 1880 the receipts wer $33r 315.479.34. All tbe inhabitants of the coun try an directly and personally interested in having proper mail facilities and naturally watch the posteffios very closely. The careful oversight on the port of tbe people has proved BOSKS DT THE WEST.

To enable the •United Btates to do its full share of this great jj^rk additional legislation is asked by the •postmaster general, to whose recommendation espeeial attention is called. The suggestion of tbe postmaster general that it Would be win to encourage by appro priate legislation the establishment ofAmerican taiee of steamers, by our own citizens, to carry the mails between onr own ports and those of Mexico, Central America, South America and to trans-Pacific countries, is commended to the serious Consideration of Congress.
