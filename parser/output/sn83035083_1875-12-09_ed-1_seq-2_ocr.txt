When, off Cape St. Roque, South America,' a'slght was ; presented1 that made the crew aghast nolhiug less than the great sea serpent engaged in a conflict with a whale.. It had wound itself twice around the whale, and was twirling it. with tremendous velocity, lashing the water "into- foam. The noise could be distinctly heard on board, aud alter battling for some time both disappeared. The serpent's length can be imagined. It had two coils around a full-sixcd sperm whale, with thirty feet clear at each end. Its diameter was from three to four feet. They saw it twice alter ward..

Liverpool Courier. ' The report of Postmaster-General Jewel Is au important document. It shows that our mail service is not yet self-sustajuing. The revenues for the past year were $i7,44i;a0.57, and the expenditures $33,011,309.4-5. The esti mated deficiency in revenue for the fiscal year i set down at the enormous sum of $8.1S1.6U2.1. One of the most important recommendations made Is that repealing tuo. increase of postage ou transient newspapers and., other printed matter. But the great feature of the report is the argument which it contains in favor of subsidies to Amer ican mail steamship lines to European and South Amerivau ports. Jewell has commonly been considered, with Bris tow, as the salt of the Administration; but the salt seems to have lost its sa vor. Such a scheme would open the door to frauds innumerable, and would burden the Government with a set of sickly transportation lines. The Re publican party baa driven American commerce from the seas, antl the Postmaster-General need not. imagine that it can be restored by direct payments from the National Treasury. WONi.n.

Allowing .one-fourth- ofr this amount for Wheat, CS8,OO0 acres, with the ave rage production at '& bushels per acre, the total capacity of this, staple alone would be 17.2uO.(KK) bushels per year, Of tins amount the estimates place the home consumption; in round numbers, at l.SOO.OOObushels, leaving an availa ble export surplus of 15, 700,00 J bushels. The subdivision of its farming laud gives the State a great advantage over California, and when, fully cultivated will, undoubtedly, divert no little trade from that quarter. . Some of the Radical papers are claiming that Senator Ferry, who by the death of Vice President - Wilson cccoines President of the Senate, aud who would succeed to the Presidency iu case of Grant's death, removal or resignation, is not an inflationist. All there is of it is, ho is in favor of in creasing the currency to 800,000,OOC aud of retiring' the : National Bank notes and substituting Government greenbacks for them; To say tho least, on the currency questiou he is not in .harmony with his party who have de clared that the Sbcriuau Resumption Act is the settled policy of the Repub lican party frem which fthero will ba j nn ttn lincL-ward."

Astor'si personal character has often been briefly sketched, He was not a large-minded man. It. was but rarely that his thoughts went out side the limits ol Jiis " own interests. He gave close personal attention to the management of his great; estate, and this occupied nearly all his . time. The poorest man in New York could not be more particular as to dimes and cents than he was. He rigorously ex acted all that was due to him,' aud he paid all that he owed. If a meebnic presented a bill for $500 05, he receiv ed iust that amount. If another man owed $10,000 03, ho had to pay the three cents with the $20,000. . Last summer a legal firm sent him notice f readiness to take up a $50,000 mort gage which he held, aud appointed the day., It was a Friday; The money was sent lo his office that day, but Mr. Astor was absent aiul his agent would not receive it. Mr. Astor was out of town and would be back ou Monday. By pulling off the settle ment uutil Monday he gained two days' interest ou $30,000. Neverthe less he was not so close a man as he lias often been represented. There was a good deal of generosity in his nature. His father bequeathed $400, 000 to establish the Aslor Library. The sou expended on that iuslitutiou oyer $100,000 more. He increased the annuity of Fit. Green llalleck, who had been a clerk in the elder Aslor's office, from $oOO lo $1,500. His uame appeared occasionally oh charity sub scription lists, and he sometimes gave money without his name." For many yeurs he was almost run down by poor Germans claiming relationship and asking aid, but he made it a rule to re fuse all applications of this kind. No doubt most: of the petitioners lor bounty were impostors. Ou one oc casion an Irishman, rather seedy, but very fluent, obtained entrauce to the house, in Lalayelte Place, and request ed an audience. He insisted that he was related to JJr. Astor, and ; had known him very well iu the old coun try. But his eloquent importuuity waa thrown away. A threat to hand him over to the police finally iuduced him to leave the house, but he thought it very hard that Astor would not help a cousin and au old neighbor. THE ASTOll

Millions of gold goes abroad to pay interest to loreieu bondholders,: stead ol being paid to our own people. A policy of rapid contraction was then inspired into the Government, when, the necessities of the war being over, further issues of bonds were made' and currency was withdrawn and all credits began to contract, as a natural aud inevitable consequence. This brought on one of those irration al conditions in human affairs which we call a 'panic,' that brought down credit at once to the zero point and shrunk the yalue of all property This is very nearly as true as Gospel. The act which repudiated the solemn contract printed on the back of every one of the war greenbacks, making them convertible into interest bearing bonds is the cause of the depreciation of the greenback. It was au enormous outrage. 1'iior to its passage the greenback was at par with the bonds, aud llicij are now eight percent, belter tban gold.
