In speaking of the currency bill Money says that In his annual report the comptroller of the currency favors the issue of notes of national banks to the par value of the bonds deposited, instead of to only 90 per cent thereof; but he insists that this Increased circu lation should be specially taxed. jOf course the government has assumed the responsibility for the ultimate re demption of these notes, and should be amply; secured; but the argument against permitting note-issues to the par of the bonds necessarily implies J.k of faith by the government in its own bonds; how could the government be better secured than by its own ob ligations, upon which it engages to pay 100 cents to the dollar? The house bill voices the sentiments of the peo ple, that the bonds of the United States should be held by the United States to be at all times worth at least par. The opinion some people have of the president's idea of trusts, notwith standing his recent utterances in his message, may be seen from the fol lowing from one of the foremost writers: "What a ridiculous farce It is for President McKinley to recom mend to congress the passage of stringent laws for the restriction of trusts. Mr McKinley knows that both he and the members of congress con stituting the majority of that body are the beneficiaries of trust contribu tions to Hanna's boodle campaign fund of '96. Mr McKinley knows that the party in power does not dare to inter fere with the gigantic jobbery in which the trusts are reveling. Mr McKinley knows that more trusts were organized under his administra tion than under all other administra tions combined. More than this, Mr McKinley knows that there is a com pact riveted with bolts of steel be tween the trusts and his political man ager, Marcus A. Haona, by which these great combines are to reap the reward of their munificent contribu tions to the republican campaign fund, and that as evidence of good faith on the part of Eanna, he had McKinley appoint a trust attorney from the trust-ridden state of New Jersey at torney general. Mr McKinley and his party have been in full control of the legislature and executive depart ments of the government for the past three years. Can anyone point to a single act which could disturb the plans of the trusts, or retard them in their purpose of suppressing trade competition? Mr McKinley mistakes the intelligence and temper of the American people when he supposes they will be caught by such chaff as constitutes that portion of his mes sage devoted to trusts."
