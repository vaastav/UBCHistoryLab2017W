Mr. Charles Edward lluesell, a close student of world conditions, and a writ r of good repute ou eco nomic matters, contribute* to WII shire's Magasine fur December an ar ticle contrasting our natiooal rail road policy with the policies of the two nation* -Germany and Japan— which are destined to he out strong tv«! rival* In International comiueicc. The article makes a striking arraign ment of mere "regulation," as U p. posed to the advantages of govern ment ownership and control of tbe avenues of trade. Every man wl*o baa been In tbe orient, says Mr. Kuaeell, knows one thing- I, et ua continue for only a few year« limger in tbe good old way, and Japan, with ber government railroad*, her government steamer*, her government-made tranapurtallon rate«, her government factories and her government trading, will make a ghœt of our commerce on the l'a cldc tXmt lulling her commercial facilities, Japan I* conducting her enterprises for tbe country's welfare, and not fur tbe aggrandisement of any fbmlly. Similarly, wltb only a part of the facilities and equipment of Japan, I« sathertng to herself the trade of South America, leaving tbe I'nlted State« relatively farther and farther behind wltb each succeeding year, our gains are maiely actual, not rel ative; In propoitlon to gtoaa bual neoa.

SOME BRAIN LEAKS !| --I » few se» remue is»« tee ft* sl tie Eittor Wine in a SOfnnam&U- | Rstk sut!. The Mothers Club, and atout thirty women of Salmon are not do ing Just what Mr. Abbott would have them do. These women bad the. temerity, and we presume Mr. Ab bott thinks, tbe medicated gall to or ganize this club without asking his, Abbott's permission, or even consult ing blm In any particular. It (hies not matter what the purposes of the organization Is; It does not have tbe republican brand In gilt edged let ters, and of course, In the eyes of Mr. Abbott, It is a delusion and a snare, and no good can possiply re sult frem It. The energies of the or ganization Is being directed towards raising funds for a public reading room, yet this Is not a worthy object In the eyes of the pinhead editor, nor are tbe ladles In his opinion, worthy of encouragement nor com mendation. In bis nariow and con tracted views he would be doing the g. o. p. an unpardonable Injury If he should support any public enterprise which would be of benllt to the eoun tiy, without consulting his masters. Mr. Abbott says he knows the ob ject of the Mothers Glut better than we do. He undoubtedly has heard tbe truism, "Self praise Is half scan dal." We have It from members of tbe club, whose word we would take quicker than the sworn statement of tbe editor of the otuer paper, that •Ince tbe day the club was organized politics has not been mentioned in Its relation to the democratic party. We are not a member of the club of course, but we have It from the word of these same ladles that they have obligated themselves to votesupon all questions favorable so far as they re late to the benefit of the home, re gardless of which party advocates them. They considered the Mormon question was one of vital Importance to the home and the future civlli/a tlon to our country, therefore they espoused the cause as represented by the democratic platform. If matters had been reversed, and the influence of the club, nationally,, had l»een with the republican party. Mr. Ab bott would be singing peans of praise for this oiganization In place of casting sneers and Invidious compar isons at the woman* organization, which represents In Its body the most cultured and Christian womanhood of the land. In bis diatribe Mr. Abbott .«ays the club "cannot mend tbe social breach." Of course wo were not here two years ago, but we are told by a number of tbe ladles of this club that the republican women or tbla city organized a republican club, which existed for a long time after the campaign wus over. The club held social functions, dances and various other umuaemeuts to hold the organization for effective work. It was the exception to the rule that a democratic lady or gentleman were Invited to these functions, yet It did not make a "social breach" nor cre ate any feeling between neighbors. We do not make tbls statement to criticise tbe republican ladies, but •Imply to show the Inconsistencies of the plnheud editor. The predc cesaoi of the writer evidently had too much intelligence and discretion to try to work up an antagonistic feel ing between neighbors, wbeie har mony and Christian fellowship should prevail. We believe the republican ladles of this town have too much sound sense to allow their po litical prejudices in terfere with thetr social amity, re gardless of how much the editor ol the other paper would try to create and encourage a different sentiment. Mr. Abhott says the "republican women of Leiuhl county know the object* of this club better than you (the writer) do." If this Is true, and we have no reason to doubt it. they know that If there Is a local atate or national question cornea up In which the sacred precincts of the home la at stake, the Mothers Club of the nation »III t>e at the Imck of the republican party, tf the party Is on the right aide of the question. We hot* the article which appeared In the other paper was not at the suggestion or dictation of any citizen of Sahuou as we would lute to think thera was another individual tn this city outside of Mi Ablwtt who Is so •mall, narrow and contracted tn his views as Mr. Abbott. We trust there la no one elae In the city who has so much ol the elements of a trouble maker In his or her composition. The Kpworth League and tbe min - Utrwof this city will no doubt se cure Mr. Abbott's life-long enmity when he find* out that they have passed resolutions commending the work of the womans organization without consulting blm Not only have they passed resolutions com mending the work, but have obligat ed themselves to give all the assist - aooe In their power to see a consum mation of their plan*. We have un doubtedly accepted a wrong Idea as to tbe duties of a newspaper to a lo cality. We have always supposed it was the duty of a newsppaer to stand up for the right and work for any project which was for the upbuilding of a community. While we accept Mr. Abtwtt's different Ideas with a gm»d grace, and with no offence, yet that we are getting too old to change now. We pray and trust that Mr. Abbott will pardon us if we should Ï | our inany years of ixperlence In tbe newspaper business we have never we have followed this plan so long to met an editor who had so little dis cretion and could make as many kinds of a fool out ol himself In so short a time a9 the editor of the other paper. In many ways he has our deepest sympathy. We presume it will be a decade before he wIHget over the licking he received Nov. 7th of tbe present year. What makes It so especially galling to him Is the fact that he was tbe county chairman of his party, and to ba»e tbe party show their resentment in such an emphatic manner ov<»r him being placed in such an important position by tbe big three, and have tbe county go democratic on the county ticket! and republican on the state ticket Is | hard for a man of the most even tem-1 périment to bear. We have shed j barrels of tears over his predicament, but at the present time we do not see how we can assuage his grief and chagrin. In closing we have a word of advice to give Mr. Abbott. That advice Is this: Support everything which Is good for the community lo which you reside whether you like It or not, and because you feel dis gruntled at half of the women of the town keep your trouble to yourself and not make a consummate chump of yourself. Broaden out! Be a man, and not a narrow contracted, egotistical elTervesence of sulphur etted hydrogen. Is Tue president's message to con gress is a voluminous document, worthy of the most careful perusal and consideration. Ills recommenda tions are so in line with what the democratic party—the Bryan democ racy—that it sounds good to the av erage democrat and no doubt much better to them than it does to the so-called leaders of the republican party. Of course tbe senators of the Platt, Aldrich and other trust sen tors will have to accept the message, and in a manner support the policies outlined by the president, but they will do It, with a bad grace. With the exception of his advocacy of the ship subsidy and a mure elastic cur rency—a currency which the bankers can manipulate to better advantage— tbe entire address Is a masterly ef fort, and will meet with the approv al of the masses of the thinking people. President Roosevelt seems to have antagonized the negros ln bis dis charging tbe colored troops,but we do not predict that it will In any manner Injure the republican party, as It Is as natural for tbe negro to be a republican as it is for him to be black. They will fret and fume around to some extent, but when a general election rolls around they will walk up to the polls and vote er straight as they have been doing for better than forty years. If Roose velt's message, the part referring to polygamy, is taken seriously it will oo the party more harm than tbe negro question. Notwithstanding Roosevelt sent Taft to Idaho some weeks ago to pull the party out of the bole, yet be seems to think there Is something to the Mormon ques tlon and suggests some very stringent laws for the oontrol of polygamy. If eongress this winter would pass some stringent law for the control of polygamy or unlawful cohabitation It would eliminate the Mormon ques tion from Idaho politics, but there 1« about as much oharces for congress to take up this Important question as there is for the Idaho legislature - 1 ! - j it a Foot Warmers You'll l>e sorry if you put off buying a Hot Water Bottle un til midwinter.
