Adams ox Slavkky. On Thanksgiv- ing-day Itev. Xehemiah Adams ot the Jssex ; street church, Boston, delivered a strong pro- slavery sermon from the text (Jeremiali l-A-i) 'Out of the North an evil shall break forth I upon all the inhabitants of the land." He argued that slavery is a divineinstitution, re t cognized as such in the Bible, and claimed that there would be no peace in the land till the people recognized and treated it as such. In speaking of this remarkable sermon of , Dr. Adams, the Jloston Journal says : 'We would resnectfullv suggest that he take for , r,- " i r ,1. the text ofhunext pohUcal d.scourse, the erse lmmeuiaiejj piutcujug xnm mu mu of the Lord came unto me the ceo;(7 time, 1 savinL' what seest thou ?
