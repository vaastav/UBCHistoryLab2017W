People in the prairie states do not need to worry about it for some months, as nature will furnish the breeze required. A get-rich-quick operator in Brook­ lyn paid $52,260 in dividends and van­ ished with $600,000 of depositors' money. The assets consist of several desks and a second-hand carpet. A man has been discovered who can walk only when he is asleep. Profes­ sional tramps will be distressed to hear that they may wake up and find them­ selves engaged in doing something use­ ful. Nearly all the contracts for the new palace to be built for the crown prince of Japan will be let to American firms. The architect is an American, and he agrees that the structure"shall be earth­ quake proof. The latest thing in Jrcphy!actics is the discovery of what is termed a "vac­ cine" for typhoid fever. Just what a cow has to do with typhoid germs is not clear, but the material, whatever it ?s, has been tried in the British army in Burmah with results which are re­ ported to be satisfactory. The new woman surely is enterpris­ ing. She isn't satisfied with old meth­ ods—not for a minute. One of them in Indiana has been stealing farm prod­ uce by the wagon load, and if she hadn't been caught just when she was there is every likelihood that she would have gotten away with a barn or a granary. Garret A. Hobart was the sixth vice president of the United States to die in office. The others were George Clinton, of New York, in 1812 Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts, in 1814 William King, of Alabama, in 1853 Henry Wil­ son, of Massachusetts, in 1875, and Thomas A. Hendricks, of Indiana, in 1885. Steven E. Burch, who got a job as a hired band on the farm of Peter Green wait, near Huron, Kan., and then eloped with the farmer's comely daughter, turns out' to be a young Missourian of wealth and social prominence, and and chose this means of finding just the wife he wanted. He has written to his new father-in-law saying that his search was along one, but has been amply rewarded. Frank D. Randall, a well-known civil engineer in Kansas City, has discovered in the grand canyon of the Colorado what he claims will prove the richest copper mines in the world. In addition to the vast deposits of virgin copper he saw immense outeroppings of gold incrusted rock and masses of schist with garnets sticking out like plums in a pudding, veins of coal and asbestos, mica, walls of onyx, columns of serpen­ tine. "I have seen thousands of persons die under all sorts of circumstances, and never yet have I seen one display the slightest fear of death." This remark­ able statement was made by a physician who has practiced many years in Phil­ adelphia, and who has seen a great deal of hospital service. "It is a popular fal­ lacy," he went on, "to imagine that a deathbed scene is ever terrible, other than as a parting between loved ones. The fear of the unknown is never pres­ ent at the last." In June n£xt. it will be 500 years since the birth of Johann Gutenberg, who invented the art of printing with mov­ able type. It is not, as a matter of fact, exactly known when he was born, but for the sake of convenience it is as­ sumed that the interesting event oc­ curred in June, 1400. That he was born in the German city of Mayence, on the Rhine, is not disputed, and in that city the fifth century of his birth will be celebrated next year by an in­ ternational printing rxhibition. A granite shaft 70 feet high is to be erected at Erie, Pa., to the memory of Capt. Gridley, of the cruiser Olympia, who died a short time after the battle of Manila bay. There will be a bust and bronze tablets, and, with othel* inscrip­ tions, Dewey's famous words: "You may fire, Gridley, when you are ready." In the meantime, Gridley's family is reported to be in very poor circum­ stances. It might be a better monu­ ment of our appreciation of the hero if we took care of his family first and built the monument afterward. The fact that 57 new cotton mills have been built in the south during the last 1? months and the probability that as many more will be erected during the coming 12 months marks an ex­ traordinary epoch in the industrial and commercial history of the south. Such an epoch can only be described by em­ ploying the superlatives of speech. The effect of the movement that is produc­ ing such a result will be felt all over the world. In the south it will change the whole aspect of affairs. It will give rise to new deals, new ambitions and new ideals. The nose is playing an important part in both real and mimic life nowadays. Having been a prominent feature in fact, having been the center of attrac­ tion on the stage—it is now coming to the front more conspicuously than be­ fore in other ways. A New York man who had the misfortune to lose his nose and who contracted with a dental op­ erator for a falsft one is wrathy because the false nose pes not fit, and he threatens suit i-a his montfy is not re­ turned or a new aVid better fitting nose is not furnished him. And who can blame him? Lillie Devereux Blake made public a statement that women are eligible to appointment as enumerators and as clerks in the compilation of the census of 1900, as they were in the census of 1880 and of 1890. She does this in the belief that women generally tjre igno­ rant of the law in this matter and in the nope' that a great many more applica­ tions will be made when the facts are generally known. And in this she Is right, no doubt. What a rare oppor­ tunity it will give women enumerators to learn, the ages of all the other women in their district! tHftv^sSj&E^it**#, Che Important Happenings of a Week Briefly Told.

FROM WASHINGTON. In his annual report to congress At­ torney General Griggs says that action against trusts can be maintained only when the offense comes within the scope of the federal statute. The first assistant postmaster gener­ al says it is incompatible with the best interests of the service to retainmarried women as post office clerks, In the last fiscal year 311,716 immi­ grants arrived in this country, an in­ crease over the number for the pre­ ceding year of 82,416.

Republican party leaders favor Sec­ retary of War Root for vice president on the ticket with McKinley in 1900. An address has been issued by Brig ham T. Roberts, who was not allowed to be sworn in as a representative in con­ gress from Utah, to the people denying the right of the house to take the action it did. THE

From August 28 to September 1, 1900, the thirty-fourth annual en­ campment of the Grand Army of the Republic will be held in Chicago. At Racine, Wis., Rev. D. B. Cheney, a prominent Baptist minister, and his wife were shot and probably fatally injured by a burglar who entered their home. The joint caucus of the Virginia leg­ islature nominated Thomas S. Martin to succeed himsefcf as United States sen­ ator. The wife of John. Karl, living five miles from St. Elmo, Ala., gave birth to six male children. In a quarrel Joseph Huttheus, aged 65, killed his wife, aged 40, near Adel, la., and then killed himself. The whole of the Stuck river valley in the state of Washington is one vast sheet of water and m&ny famllies have been driven from thei^boriies. On suspicion of ha%ng 'made ..the murderous attack onM v. D, B. Cheney and his wife H. F^Corbfctt was arrested in Raeine. Wis. It is thought "bpth ot the victims, will recover. G. M.

Aguinaldo is said to be willing to surrender to Consul General Wild man. Gen. Hughe's occupies 20 towns in Panay. Advices received in London say that the Boer artillery commanding Lady smith continues to bombard the city daily. A number of the British guns have been silenced. Gen. Cronje's force continues to shell Mafeking at inter* vals and expects soon to reduce the town. The Boer forces south of Kim berley are making thq advance of Gen. Methuen very difficult. Expectation of catching Aguinaldo in the north has been practically aban­ doned, and the probability now is that he will turn southward, if he is not al­ ready there, with his destination Cavite province, his home, where the insur­ rection began and where it still has its greatest strength. Gen. Young has ar­ rived at Vigan, after a hard but success­ ful fight with a greatly superior force of Filipinos, in which the Americans had one killed and 12 wounded. The. enemy's loss was heavy. Advices from South Africa say that with Gen. Buller not far from Colenso, Gen. Methuen again in the saddle and President Steyn, of the Orange Free State, at the head of the Modder river commando, there seems to be sufficient promise of exciting events. Serious battles are looked for in the vicinity of Ladysmith and to the south of Kim berley. In a severe storm on the English coast five life-savers were drowned. 

LATER NEWS. Gen. Young put Gen. Tino, with a much superior force, to flight. Gen. Tino made a stand in the mountain pass between Narbacan and San Quin to. The natural strength of the posi. tion was augmented by trenches and pitfalls. The fight lasted five hours.

Washington, Dec. 11.—The considera­ tion of the case of Mr. Roberts, of Utah, was resumed at ten o'clock in the morn­ ing by the house investigating commit­ tee, ,Mr. Roberts being present to plead to certain specific interrogatories which had been framed. The proceed­ ings continued to be behind closed doors. Mr. Roberts was first asked if he conceded the existence of the court record wherein he pleaded guilty, in 1889 under the Edmunds-Tucker law. This he conceded. He was next asked whether about 1887 or since 1890, he had married plural wives and had lived with them since that time as wives.,. Roberta Pleads Not Guilty. To the whole of this charge Roberts pleaded not guilty, and then demurred to the jurisdiction of the committee for the following reasons: "First—On the ground of violation of constitutional rights In that it attempted to try him for a crime without presentment of indictment by grand jury, and without trial before a jury and due process of law. "Second—That it was an attempt to de­ prive him of vested property that he held fn the emoluments of an office for the full term. "Third—That the only evidence that eould be rightfully considered in the com­ mittee was a court record establishing the guilt, confessed or proven, of the repre­ sentative-elect and that the committee has no right to consider any other evi­ dence. "Fourth—That the crime alleged—name­ ly, that of unlawful cohabitation—even if proven would not constitute a sufficient crime to bar a member or deprive him of his seat, because Innocence of polygamy or unlawful cohabitation is nowhere enumerated in the constitution as a quali­ fication for the office of member of con­ gress, nor is it named in any United States law applicable to Utah or any other state." Legal Controversy TUronishont. Mr. Roberts argued these points for nearly two hours, referring to law books and answering queries. It was a legal controversy throughout, the facts not being gone into at length. Mr. Roberts concluded by asking that his primal facie right to a seat be at once considered, as the present status denied to a sovereign state representa­ tion in the house at a time when in­ jurious legislation affecting that state might take place.. Pnblic Sessions Hereafter. At the conclusion of Mr. Roberts' statement the committee held an exec­ utive session and then adjourned until two p. m. The chairman announced that subsequent meetings would be open and publicity also was given to the official stenographer's reports of the morning session. A Sensation. At the afternoon session of the Rob­ erts investigating committee, Mr. Rob­ erts created a sensation by denouncing A. T. Schroeder, one of the gentile dele­ gation from Utah. Mr. Schroeder was about to address the committee, when Roberts, waving his hand in protest, said: "I object. I object to this witness if he comes here as an attorney. I object to him if he comes as a witness, on the ground that he is unworthy of confidence and be­ cause he is a common swindler. And I propose to establish by the records of the supreme court of Utah that he is utterly unworthy of belief.". After some explanations, Mr. Schroeder was permitted to proceed. Defends Department Stores. Washington, Dec. 11. Hon. John Wanamaker Saturday testified before the industrial commission on the sub­ ject of department stores. He claimed these stores were beneficial to society, having a substantial economic and mor­ al basis for their existence. "It is," he continued, "a natural product evolved from conditions that exist as a result of fixed trade laws. Cheaper capital, bet­ ter transportation, more rapid com­ munication make the modern retail store possible, natural and useful, therefore inevitable." Indians Employ an Illinois Han. Tahlequah, I. T., Dec. 11. The Cher­ okee legislature has passed an act em­ ploying Judge William M. Springer, of Illinois, as resident attorney for the Cherokees at Washington for one year. An act was also passed authorizing a delegation of four persons, two of whom must be full-blooded, to go to Washington in the interest of the Cher­ okee nation. Dnlce of Manchester Sick. New York, Dec. 11.—The duke of Manchester, who is confined to his rooms in the Waldorf-Astoria with a severe attack of nervous prostration, will be unable to sail for England Sat­ urday as he had planned. The cable­ gram received a few days ago sum­ moning the duke home to his sister's deathbed completely prostrated him. Quarantine Against Texan Fever. Washington, Dec. 11.—The usual an­ nual quarantine order against the area where the splenetic or southern (Tex­ as) fever exists among cattle will be issued shortly by the department of agriculture, to take effect January 1. The order will be substantially like that of last year. Return Another Indictment. Lansing, Mich., Dec. 11.—The grand jury returned another indictment at 11 o'clock and adjourned until Mon­ day. The name of the person indicted is suppressed, but it is surmised that the respondent is a former state offi­ cial. I Its Origin. "Hoot!" cried the owl ever and anon. The fowls of the air and the beasts of the field stirred uneasily in their sleep and mut­ tered maledictions. "Why1 are they so angry?" asked the owlet at last.

"OPEN DOOR" IN CHINA, Decision of Powers to Maintain This Policy Very Gratifying to j. United States. Washington, Dec. 11.—The various publications coming from European sources, touching the decision of the powers to meet the United States' re­ quest for a formal written undertaking to maintain the "open door" in China, are giving satisfaction to the officials here as indicating the success of this important diplomatic.' negotiation. However, it may be stated the responses of the European governments have not yet reached the state department. It is realized thoroughly that in a matter of this importance the negotiation must be conducted with the greatest, circumspection and deliberation. Hence it is no matter for surprise that the responses have not yet been re­ ceived. It is hoped that the final suc­ cess of the negotiations can be com­ municated to congress in the shape of a special message from the president, accompanied by an explanatory state­ ment from Secretary Hay, soon after the holidays. London, Dec. 11.—The Berlin corre­ spondent of the Standard says: All the powers concerned have favorably re­ ceived the proposals of the United States regarding the maintenance of the "open door" in China, each offer­ ing to sign the desired assurance if the others will do so. 

ATTACK AGUINALDO'S GUARD. Dispatches from Gen. Otis Indicates That Americans Are Pressing Filipino Leader Very Hard. Washington, Dec. 11.—The war de­ partment has received the following from Gen. Otis: "Manila, Dec. 9.—Dispatch from Young at Vigan .yesterday says escaped Spanish prisoners report four hours' engagement 3d inst. between his troops and Aguinal­ do's guard near Cervantes, 50 miles south­ east of Vigan, with heavy loss to enemy, who is being pursued. Our loss one killed six wounded inhabitants of own accord join troops repairing trail and carrying subsistence.

Navy reaches Aparri to-morrow column of MacArthur's troops Twenty-fifth in­ fantry reported near Iba west coast Zam bales Grant's column near Subig bay Lawton in Bulucan province to-day with sufficient troops to overcome opposition and scatter enemy." It-is probable that the troops which engaged Aguinaldo's guard are Hare's command, as he was reported to be close in the insurgent leader's rear. Gen. Otis also cables as follows re­ garding the revolt in Negros: "Information received that Negros re­ volt of minor importance Byrnes in rapid pursuit of disaffected party Hughes in mountains Panay en route Capiz." Will Ask Congress for Protection. Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 11. Owing to the possible infection of fruit or­ chards by the importations from other states or foreign countries of fruit trees infected with worms, scale or other parasites, the Association of Hor­ ticultural Commissioners of southern California has drafted a bill to be sub­ mitted to congress. It proposes to es­ tablish a national quarantine law against infected nursery stock of all kinds imported from foreign countries, and containing other provisions of sim­ ilar nature to operate as an interstate law against such pests. Orders Pay Stopped. Washington, Dec. 11. One of the re­ sults of the investigations made in the case of the troopship Tartar is the stop­ page of the pay of Maj. John A. Rafter, surgeon, Twentieth Kansas volunteers. This action was taken at t^e request of Gen. Shafter and was seconded by Sec­ retary Root. Gen. Shafter, who has di­ rection of the inquiry, suggested that the pay in Surgeon Rafter's case be suspended until certain accounts for the provisioning of sick soldiers on board the transport are settled. Will Reconstruct Isthmus Railroad. London, Dec. 11. The Westminster Gazette says Sir Weetman Dickinson Pearson, M. P., for Colchester and head of the firm of S. Pearson & Son, limited, contractors for public works, has com­ pleted negotiations with the Mexican government to take over the Isthmus of Tehauntepec railroad on a 50 years' lease.

Washington, Dec. 11.—Early Satur­ day fire totally destroyed the Welling mansion, at Fourteenth street and Welling Place, this city. The loss on the residence was $60,000, and on the contents about $50,000. Dr. L. H. French occupied the residence and, with his servants, escaped from the building just as the roof fell in. Big Contract for Mules. St. Louis, Dec. 11.—Capt. Marshall, an officer in the British army, has closed a contract with a local firm for 1,000 Missouri mules, to be used in South Africa. It is expected that other contracts may be let within a short time for 10,000 more animals. -To Blake Her Home In New York. New York, Dec. 11.—Lady Francis Cook, formerly Tennie C. Lafflin, has sent $2,000,000 to this city to be used in purchasing real estate, and it is stated that it is her iaa|ntion soon to leave England and make her home in New York- Under Two Flags. "What a grand picture it'must have been," remarked the boarder who had seen Dewey, "to have seen the Olympia steaming home, the stars and stripes on one mast and the homeward pennant on the other."
