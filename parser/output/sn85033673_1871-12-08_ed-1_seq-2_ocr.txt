IU1 MAYO I JOHN JOHHSONu ! i . TEKT LIBEBAX. , ' C"- " Tbe President'! liberality is amazing. Us is willing to have all the internal rev enue duties abolished, exoept those on soirits, tobacco and stamps. The last mentioned, remarks the Cincinnati .En quirer, is one of the moat vexatious and hated of all the internal revenue impo sitions. In many part of the country they are difficult to procure, and there is a great amount of ignorance in re gard to the kind and value of the stamps which are necessary for legal mstru nients. Of this ignorance sharpen and knaves frequently take advantage. The stamp act, associated as it is with the cause which drove our Revolutionary ancestors Jfl rebellion against Great Britain, has a memory that is far" from being fragrant to the public mind. The , stamp taxes which pur ancestors re sented were not as onerous as, those of the present day. Tbty ought by. all means to be abolished. (i In regard to the duties upon spirits and tobacco, there nsed to be an idea in "the Ameri can mind that taxation should be levied equally among all classes and conditions of men. This does Dot aecm to jibe very well with the notion, that the grow ers and consumers of ' two articles should pay f l( the revenue that is de rived from internal sources, and that the raisers ' and consumers, of otbsrl commodities should go scot free." i i v . : 

MONGBEL FROQBJESS, , , The thirst for conquest has ruined many a State, and dragged many a na tion down. If reports from sources likely to be informed, be tree this Gov ernment is meditating an annexation crusade to the south of us.' Under the form of a protectorate over Mexico, that country may be practically annexed. An exchange remarks: "The mongrel populations of San Domingo and Mex ico joined to the blacks and mulattoes of the Southern States, the United States ( would be so hybrid in the character of its population as to make it impossible to claim for its civilization that of the white race, which wesuppose is what is re ally desired by those who are giving coun tenance to tbe San Domingo and Mexican absorption schemes. Some think that our political polity is already so de bauched that the adding of additional mongrel populations can not hurt it. We cannot concur in that view nnless the great law of the white race subjec- j tion or extinction shall be applied to them as it has been by us to the Indians. We think, however, that for the present, and for some time to come, they had better be permitted to pursue the work of extermination among themselves,' and thereby save us the cost and trouble of d ling that favor for them. AJIHESTT. It is probable that Congress will pass an amnesty bill at this session. A tele gram of yesterday from Washington says: "An effort will be made, and it is likely to be successful, in the Bouse to open the new year with universal am nesty. Last year tbe House passed a bill granting amnesty to all persons ex cept those who left the army and navy and Congress to join the Confederacy. This was briefly considered in the Sen ate, and will he called up again on Mon day. The House Committft on the In surrectionary States also considered a general amnesty bill to-day, and will probably report it to the House this week. The principal opposition to am; . nesty now comes from the carpet-bag class of Congressmen from the South, who have not hesitated to privately de nounce Grant's recommendations on that subject." We do not believe that Congress will pass a straight-out am nesty bill. It is most probable that one tied down with conditions will go through. The South Carolina Bowen, though crushed, is not destroyed. "Immedi ately after the holidays he if expected to arrive at the seat of Government, not as a mere looker on to idly and disinterested ly watch the movements of legislation; not as a caeuaf visitor, stopping awhile at the hub of the republic; not as an ambassador from Utah, prepared to show the proper committee the blessings incident to the possession of numerous wivesbut as an outraged and insulted patriot, whose wrongs clamor forimme-. diate redress." He expects to take his seat in Congress, contesting that of a negro. Tbe anti-Grant Republicans, acoord ing to news from Washington, bare no . - i. :j influence ana no courage, n is iu that whatevi r may be the strength of the latter in the country, there does not appear at present to be a single one of the 133 Kepublican members of the House who is willing td publicly an nounce his opposition to the re-nomination of Grant. There are, nevertheless, many who are at heart opposed to it, but they at the same time admit that if he is the nominee of the Bepublican party they will be obliged to support him. r.nvnvna Baowx has appointed Bob-1 rt Mt-Farland to fill the vacancy on tbe Tennessee Supreme Bench caused by the resignation of Judge T. A. B. Nel-s-)0, and which Mr. Shields declined. Mr M. Farland resides ia lorri'town, East Tennessee, and is a lawyer of emi Senator Sumner was in New York the other day. The Commercial Adver tiser says that, to a friend who sppke of bn being the Democratic candidate tor the Fresideney, Mr. Sumner-replied he had noticed in previous "years that the Democracy often talked of availing themselves of an opponent as candi date, but he never knew them to do it He said Mr. Chase was flattered into an acceptance, when they turned Ine cold shoulder upon him, and run in Mr. Sey mour"' I1 '. The Louisville .Courier of yesterday says: It is claimed by the friends of Humphrey Marshall that he is the com ing man for Senator. Certainly General Marshall bas brains enough to make half-a-dozen ovor-verage Senators. But the friends of McCreery and Beck are not going to let the outside-party dodge win without a fight. Again, there is stroni combination forming to elect Judge Lindsay of the Court of Appeals, A Washington dispatch aays: Tbe select committee" on the insurrectionary States, in additioa to reporting a bill re moving all remaining political disabili ties imposed by the Fourteenth amend ment, will supplement it by a b.ilj. ex tending the operations of the Ku-Klux act and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus beyond the present There are forty-four standing com mittees in the House of Representatives ofthe United States.

The follow ing is special correspondence to New York Tribune Washington, December 7. The Ap propriation Committee of the Hon held its first meeting to-day. It was agreed to begin work on Monday. Mem bers of the committee say tbey have a hard task before them. They succeed a committee which, under tbe lead of Mr. Dawes (Radical), made appropria tions at such low figures that a deficieny bill had to be passed to keep the wheels of government in motion; yet the pub lic experts that the present oemmiUet will still further cut down Government expenses. I be committee appears to oe firmly resolved to make all possible re trenchment, and they hope to be able to find and stop some leaks in tbe Treas ury that their predecessors did not dis cover. The Wars aud Urana tomuilttof hss not taken action upon th4 business re-' ferred to it. Some of the Democrats of the House say they believe there is a project in contemplation for the increase of the army They thinkvihat the faint pros- pect of a rupture with Spain will be made an excuse for authorizing the President to add twenty thousand men ta tha military torce. General Banks will introduce in the House on Monday a bill to carry into effect the treaties between the I'nited Slates and Great Britain, relative to the free importation of goods from Can ada into the I'nited States. Washington, December 8. Sumner gave notit-e yesterday that on Monday next he would move fur the abolition of the office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This position causes much comment and its bearings are not at a(l understood. The movement promises to meet with success, as the importance of the office is steadily diminishing with the abolition of the internal revenue taxes.. But the bureau will be necessary as long as any internal taxes are levied, and must necessarily have a head. Mr. Douglass' nomination, aeut in yesterday, 11 undoubtedly be confirmed ty tne Senate.
