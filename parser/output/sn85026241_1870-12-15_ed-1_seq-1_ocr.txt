While calling attention to the low terms offered to Clubs, we would ask the pnolic lo ber in mind that Ihe Gazette contains more reading matter than any other paper prluted iu theeity.aud that it offers ane third more information in each Weekly than other papers which are published at about the same price. In comparing prices, thisa point that should not be overlooked. THE WEEKLY GAZETTE Is printed on clear type, contains an average ol tiurty-roui columns of reading matter, and is specially de-sigued for the couulry. News, Literature. Commerce, Manufactures and Agriculture arc- the specialties of this edition, and each department will be found full and complete. Farmers will find the Agricultural Department, which Is in charge of an editor ol practical experience In that line ol industry, of great value. The proceedingsof the Cincin nati Horticultural Society are also printed In this paper. A first class (original or selected; st rv w ill always be found in the WEEKLY GAZETTIi", fflth enough politics and religions InteUi jence to keep the reader fully advised ol movements in State and Church. The world is the field in which we labor, and nothing of in terest to the public will escape attention.

The aitcn'.ion of far.i era Is particularly direc ted to the Agricultural deparliueri of the Ga zette, which is a specialty iu the Weekly edi tion. This contains, lo a large extent, an in terchange of views between practical men, wlileli is proving Interesting and valuable.and has, during the last year, been ui iversally commended by onr subscribers. The informa tion thus obtained from practical men. and dis seminated through the columns of the Gazette, isot more real va.'ue than volumes thai arc written on agricultural subjects by mere theorists. The man who does a thing is far more capable of telling how it is done than the man who get all his k .owledge from b oks, and knows nothing about practical farming, tinragricultural readers regaid this department ol the Gazette alone worth fully the subscrip tion price of the paper.

CONGRESS. The last session of tbe 41st C ngresss tiegaD at noun Monday, December otli, A iut-iti ii- ruber of persons were ic at tendant e; ODe hundred and seven ty bree members of the House and nearly ill of ihe SenaU. At 1 20 p. m. the President's Message was read, occupying in hour. It was well received by tbe Republican side ol the House. Previous 0 tbe reading of the Message, a bill was Introduced by Messrs. Cole and Cas serly for the repeal of all laws relating ta the collection of income b xei. Also 1 bill was intra.luced by Mr. Sumner, to .-ease the produciton of new currency, :hus providing for a return to spec e nay me nt by allowing the old currency ;o wear out. Mr. 8bennan made an effort to obtain lie ac'ion of Congress upon tbe Obio Soldier Home difficulty, or to secure the uuiates there tbe right of voting After the reading af the -.essage Messrs. Duke of Virginia, Sypber of Louisiana, Dizou of North Carolina, were sworn in. 

SECOND DAY. Alter tue presentation ot some minor tiil s & pelitioui.,atiolher Land grant bill was brought lorwanl by Mr. Wilson of Minuesota. The road for which ti is aid was intended connects St. Croix Iliver with west end of Lake Superior. This met wiib considerable opposition and was postponed until next Tuesday. Mr. Logau introduced a bill to abolish the office of Admiral and Vice Admiral iu the Navy. This bill will be brought up no Monday next. Mr. Ilaldeman of Pennsylvania ofTer a bill looking into the accuracy of tbe ale Census. Mr. Connor of Texas otTered a bill to ibolish duties on tea, sugar and coffee. Itt-fered to Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. Porter of New Yerk introduced a ii!l to repeal tbe Franking privilege, deferred to Committee ou PostfRoads. A bill was introduced oy a aieirjl.er 'rom Minnesota inquiring into the pay nent of interest on bonda'by the Pacific ail road. On motion of Mr. Schenck the Presi kent'8 Message was divided up and Re igned to the several Comrnittae's. Political. The Presidents Message. From the N, Y. Tribune. Wecauuo: doubt that Gen. Grant's econd Annual Message will be read vith hearty approval by a great majori vof his countrymen and with interest ,nd pride tiy them all. The prominent edtures of his Administration had al ady commanded popular approbation, ml this Message will still more endear be President to the hearts of his coun-1 lymeii. Peace unbroken even by an udiau massacre, an ample llevenue, a aptdly. dimiuisned and diminishing fatten! Debt, reduced Taxes with per istent reduction of the National Ex- icudituies such ar the general out- iues of our last year's history. Why bould it not be regarded wuli complac- ucy by the President and with giali-1 ude and pride by the American. Peo--le? With regard to San Domingo, the 'resident is clearly right in tie position i not unsiuforu.ed as to the material acts; and we think he is not. If the i peopleof that republic heartily desire 1.0 unite their destinies with . .;:?, . hy should we coldly repulse lhean? His an- j nexation proclivities tire- provnl and un questionable: if they aro odious, why, lias he not been Overth-ownT We sub- j mit hat Congress will be constrained by j public sentiment to admit s'a'a Domingo ' into our Union unless it can tie made to appear tbatfcer people :ar re onderant iv :i verse tosucb a fti-ion. If they are ao, li that fact should be coticltisi ve; but the j weigbtof testimony is COW in tbe sc;.Ie of Annexation. Unless tiie aspect shall ' ba materially changed, the Republic of SauDomiueo i!! be mergi d iu the Uui- ted States wit tin the year 1871. We do j ' not anticipate from thai accession all the i bless:; gsexpected by the.President; yet j I we ate sure that an Domingo is worth j 1 j a dozen Abiskas. There can be no ini - i take as to the general accord with Gen. : Grant's leeomineiuiatious on this head. 1 1 As to Cuba, it is plain that the Vol- i mitecr rnie now rampant in the cities L and iu the great rogar estates has nearly j exhausledjby itsoutrases the President's ' i patience. If Spain can subjugate Cuba, ' i w hy not do it? If not, w hy not Jesist 1 1 from cbe wasteful attempt? Humanity j anil reason cry aloud for a cassation ofti hostilities if they can obly be prosecuted i as they have been for the last year. i With regard to our Alabama claims, ; ! we regret the silence of tbe Mrs :ge .is . to what has been done or attempted by t our Government since Christmas, Great I Britain, if w e understand net official ! i documents, awaits a definite proposition ' i j overture iron oui side.

Eu- rope is so well said that are are impelled j ' to wish that he hail snir; more. How-J' ever "enough is as good as a feast." 1 Ti.e President's suggestions and re- j commendations with regard to tiie Pi i - ' j lie Lands and Landgrants are generally j 1 wise and timely. His recommendation ' of the services of Postmaster General j 1 i Creswell has been richly earned. As to "Ite venue Beforsa," Geo. Grant ! ! I is in hearty accord with the pobUeJodg- ! uient. li'- favors all possible reform, 1 I but no destruction either of lb-venue or 1 Protection. He might have defended ' I the latter more emphatically; but bis j heart is in the right place and bis best I 1 I efforts will not be wanting to sustain the ' I expo-ed and assailed departments of I our National Industry. ' Many will i e surprised by the Presi- j dent's hearty indorsement of Civil Ser- 1 I vice Reform; but he has been there all s j along. We trust that Reform wi,l re- 1 ceive a decided impetus from his earnest i commendation. ' Finally, the President's summing up j of the lending objects of his policy, and 1 j especially bis desire to s, cure "a pure, j 1 I nn trammeled ballot," must appeal 1 cogently to the judgment and aft' ctions ' of the Americ n People. He is Abra- ' I i i ham Lin coin's liueal successor, and the j popular heart beats iu unison with his j ' aspiration a d his efforts. 1 From t!e Wheeling IntlUgeuoer. The greater pari of tne message, if hot ' ! always strong, is rather adroit, .-unreal- ' j culated tostreugthtn the President with c the people. In this respect, tbe urgency ' in regard to San Domingo is the chief 1 blunder of the whole document. It will c only strengthen the determined opposi- tiou to the scheme, and add fuel to tiie 1 flame of discord oxcited by it last win tar. ' The President would have h ar. nonized 1 things aud strengthened the admin s- j tratiou far more by leaving the scheme ' where the Senate left it last winter. Ex- 1 cept ou thia point, and one or two others j such as ".Revenue Iieiorm," or. which ' ltepublicaus are divided, they will gen- 1 i erally receive tiie President's views with r a unanimity of favor. He has avoided 1 ; at leastone rock by his entire silence on 1 the question of amnesty, that being 8 I another mutier ou which the party is 8 j sharply divided. But in doing this ne ' detracts somewhat from -his reputation c j for giving frank expres-ion to his views 1 j ou all proper queatious. Evidently in e i his two years in the White House, the I ! Pr sident has yielded something of his ' j soldierly bluntness to the diplomatic 1 necessities of tiie situation. . 0 The Times says the measnga is the f best answer t those who insiat that the 1 , mission of the Republican party is end ed, or impugn General Grant's fitness for Interpreting the Wishes and promo ting tbe interest of the people, and thai ! I the policy sat forth is at once positive ' j and practical. The writer thinks it is ' clear thai the President has no idea o. u ' plunging the nation recklessly iato a J war as a means of manufacturing party 1 capital. 1 The World severely criticises the nies- ! sage, and thinks it is a document Which uaeas agoed deal of winnowing to sepj. I rate the small amount of graiu from the i heap of chaff in which it is buried. P The Sun can find little merit orsatisfac- ! tion iu the message, and terms it a pov- c erty strickeu document. The Hera thinks the President's mes- Eage is a good State paper and astaunch party platform. That its an exhibit of s' the management under his supervision of ihe Government, in our foreign and domestic affairs, ibere is much iu it that i' is good and encouraging, and as a fore- d shadowing of the general policy of his " adrniuistra. ion there is nothing in it b calculated to disabuse tbe general confi- w deuce of the country. .

Hunting Rocky Mountain Sheep. We had beeu at our new camp several l days, and taken all the game we want- ed, when, one morning, I determined to climb the mountain peaks and have a bunt after the famous mountain sheep. , My companions liked tbe idea o'f a dash . at the "hard heads." and we all three set out together. The sun met us as v, re . toiled up the steeps, and it was scarcely ; ( half an hour higli when La Frombe, j who was iu advance, halted aud poiut- '. j ing to a lift' half a mile distant, said, 'There they are." Wo looked in the , iirection indicated and saw a group of four sheep walking along the edge of a ; ( precipice. They hai not jet discovered 11s, and we stood still until they passed 1 ( aut of sight behind some projecting ; ( rocks, aud then ran as fast as we could iloug the mountain side until we were t Urectly under where we had seen our , ?ame. Carefully asceuding f om crag ( to crag, we were not long in coming t jpon their fresh tracks, aud now we , :rept along, looking carefully ahead at ( jvery turn. Presently La Fr mbe ointed to the right, aud there, standing in a rock, scarcely two hundred yards from us, were three large sheep. We , tacfa selected a slieep La Frombe ta tsing Ihe one ou the le t, the Santee the : ' ine in the in in die, aud I the farthest on ; J the right. At a signal Irom La Frombe we fired together, and when the smoke sleared away saw one sheep lying on the rock. I ran as fast as I could up the j . rocks, aud arrived in time to see the , jther two big boms g ing around J he bluif a quarter of a mile oft. La frombe had killed his game, but the 1 santee aud I had missed our mark. I, j 1 jowever, noticed blood ou the stones, ( uid knowing that one of the other two ; 1 was wounded, determined to follow 1 hem. Leaving La Frombe and the ' santee to skin and dress the deael ani- 1 rial, I climbed from ravine to ravine ! 1 ind rock to rock for nearly an hour, and ! ' lad began to despair of seeing my game- ; 1 igaiu, when I unexpectedly came upon j : ome blood and tracks. I saw where ; 1 he sheep had lain but a few minutes I ' jefore, and ns there was some sofi soil t it this point so I could follow the tracks, t crawled carefully along. I paused of- j s en to watch and lis. en, but could see 1 tiling, aud all was silent as only the 1 ,'a:t soiitudes ol a mountain can be. I ! j lad began to descend a little, with a riew of getting among some scrubby j dues near by, in order the better to ; e ihield myself from observation, and just j 1 is I reached them, I saw a stately ram I , ,va. king slowly along a ledge of rocks, j c losely followed by a small ewe. I was j t ret too far away to shoot with precision, ' ' ind as they were moving slowly, and i ! lad not seen me, I stood still until they a urued the.rock. They were moving par illel with me, and I now hastened, under -:over of the pines, to get ahead of them, It possible. After getting one or two alls, and nearly breaking my gun aud s leek over the stones, I perceived the t beep nearly above me, and not over 8 wo hundred y-rdsdistaut. Icrauledto r he edge of the rock, aud selecting an ; I ipen spot, where I knew the sheep i ' vould pass, rested my gun. In a mo- j 1 nent ihey appeared, and when the ram 1 1 anas opposite theehdof my rifle, I lired. i 1 Phe old fellow dropped; rolled over, I s urued upon his horns, and fell over for- j 1 y feet, lighting on his head. He was lesperately wounded, but still able to 1 ise. As he steadied himself for another j 1) ump I put a third ball into him, and he f ay dowu on the rocks. I scrambled up I b 0 him, and when he saw me he made j f lesperate efforts ioget upefh his feet. He I n ay upon his side, his gret red eyes 1 s oiling fiercely. When I went near him j a ie bleated piteously, and struck with I a lis forefeet, at the same time tossing his c reat horns savagely about. I tried for g orae time to ge t hold of him, not wish- h ng to shoot himaaiu as I had but two t: barges left in my gun, and I had left e ay amunition-belt behind, in order to I limb the better. Every time- I ap iroached he struck at me, until, Anally a osing my patience, I pounced upon I n lim from behind, and seizing hold of one 0 f his horns, attempted to draw my iiinting-knife across his throat, ''.hrow- P ng back his head with a strength that 0 urpris.ed me, he struck me wilh his n ioru on the knee, and almost broke my 1 ;g. It was only after a severe struggle P hat I was able to drive my knife into ? lis neck and finish him. I VVheB I had killed the ram I looked p, aud there stood the doe, hardly fifty ards.distant. She had been looking at he death of.her mate, and now, even as j looked at her, bounded nimbly away vpt the rocks. I fired a shot at her, n tit it did not hit her, and I sat down erfectly satisfied with my ram. I was not long in signaling my com-laai-'i'S, and presently I heard the long talla-ho!" of La Frombe, who was oming up the steps below me. I had my sheep skinned and dressed ythetime theycame up, and the pines Hording a favorable place, we cut off lr ime of the choice bits, roasted them on e ie coals, and diued. We were all three very tired, aud hav- 1 lg had euough of sheep-hunting for one ay, we rested for a couple of hours, and ten, packing our meat on our backs, egan the descent. It was quite iate hen we reached our camp, aud ns we ere weary, and bruised by many a fall j ;ceived during the day, we soon went j M 1 bed. u( Hunting the Rocky M.iuutai" sheep Is the J llv sport that approximates toan v iiiinK lilie ( jn ie famous chamois banting of olden tunes, ne Best) of these sheep is very Rood, but they el e exceedingly difficult to kill.

Take Care of the Eyes. [From the N. Y. Independent.] Oculisis say that the eye which has; uever been stiained by reading and wri-! ting in dim or unsteady light, or while the body is in nioti. n, as in railway riding or in an improper position, as in t yingdown such an eye will stand the j wear and tear ef seventy years better' ban can any organ in the body. We lelieve this. Its iuelfable delicacy ind perfection of mechanism indicate this. They also indicate the probable i rreparableness of even a slight injury to ' t. We know a young girl, of an appar-1 n'.ly healthy body, who by one short ending at twilight iu a book of fine! riut so lost the use of her eyes that for wo years she was ableio read only all arefuily measured, and dimiuit bed in-! ervals of a few moments each, and for; be rest of her li fe she will lie obliged to ! ncereise the greatest caution aud for-j i ee ranee, Such deprivation as this is lothing less than one degree of being dind. That thousands of people may ibuse their eyes and escape this result loes not make it any the more right for hem to tun tiie risk. Last Words of Lee and Jackson If the wandering death-bed utterances ; )f two great Confederate chieftains,! 'Stonewall" Jackson aud Robert E. Lee' nay bee insidered us final up.ni the mat er, then the late confederate General A. P. Hiil, who lost his life at the closing jattle of the war, must be accepted by iistory as the most trusted coadjutor ol hose eminent commanders. In hisdy ng moments, Ja ckson exclaimed "Send . P.

Upon his death )e.l at Lexington, (iiisjinal Lee, as the ele-graph states, his mind reverting to he bloody events of the war, "once or-l-Tedjhis tent to be stuck and at another hue desired Hill to be s..-ut for."
