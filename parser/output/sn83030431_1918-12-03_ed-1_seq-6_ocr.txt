Washington was quitting offlce for ever; Wilson Is merely quitting lits appointed post of duty. Washington used the solemn occasion to Impart to hl-j follow countrymen advice as to the avoidance of entanglement In for eign nffalrs advice which shaped the policy of the United States Govern ment for more than a century. Wily Box uses the present occasion to In dicate vngirly to his fellow citizens n future of par.' -Ipatlon In the nffalrs or foreign natlu.is, illimitable In Its extent, unbounded In Us possibilities, Immeasurable In Its dangers. It Is not a strain of Inngunge to speak of thte momentous speech at tho Capitol as n fareweti address, for President Wilson Is bidding good-by to many things as be sails r.way with his ex pensive retlnric Into the unknown on a ship which' the irony of accident has named the George Washington. He Is bidding farewell, among other things, to even tho slenderest pretenco that either the people of the United States, of whom he again says ho Is the servant, or the Senators of the United States, his constitu tional partners In treaty making, arc entitled to tho least enlightenment con rernlng his real reasons for going nhrond or his purposes while abroad ns the bearer of tho Wilson fourteen. Any expectation that he might, at the Inst moment, take the people nnd the Scnnte Into his confidence hns been rudely shattered when the con cluding paragraph of his address hns been read. He plays with fnir words that carry no meaning. The denial of information fo the nation is abso lute; the servant goes out slamming the door In tho face of the acknowl edged master, stnndlng in dumb sur prise nnd awaiting an explanation of the errand. The refusal of informa tion to the Senate, his senior partner In the treat- business in which he Is engaged, is so marked iii the cynicism of the ignoring as to como nigh to the edge of Insult. This is the outstanding fact nbout an address which will bo read to-day with amazement everywhere, with honest Indignation in many quarters. Styling himself the servant of the nation, Mr. Wilson Is proceeding pre cisely ns If ho were Its master, as if the arrangement of the nation's poli cies and destinies rested exclusively with him, with his Independent nnd uncontrolled Judgment. He vouch safes to tho Congress nnd to the peo ple no fit explanation of his departure, no declaration of his intentions except ho far as they are suggested In tho fourteen generalities formulated In his Individual mind and enunciated on his individual authority. Let us fcco what his prospectus Is. Ho realizes "the great Inconven iences" that will attend his leaving the country at this time, but has come, In his capacity an an individual temporarily holding uiilco under n government of law, to the conclusion that it Is lils "paramount duty" to instrurt the Allied Governments as to the Interpretation and application of the fourteen' generalities- which he has Individually framed. Ho goes not because, the Constitution pre erlbcs it, not because uny clearly seen fcaturo of the tdtmitlnn requires It, but because he wishes 0 explain and enforce certain generul principles of world In.. -rest which represent no au- ffiorlfatfvo d6ciarnUon of tho Unlfed States Government ns ft whole but are from first to last the conceptions of fils Individual Intellect. tic says that tho Allied Governments "very reasonably deslro" hla personal counsel; but tho evidence of the Invitation, the evidence even of the desire of the Allies to hnvo him phys ically present nt tho conference, Is by no means so definite ns might bo wished. And even if tho invitation were unanimous nnd the desire super heated, thero would etlH remalp the fnc that Mr. Wilson can gratify it only by abandoning for n time the duties nnd functions Imposed on him nllko by the Constitution and his onth of office. Ills paramount duty Is defined not by the desires of the foreign Governments, not by his own inclination nnd decision, but by tho Constitution and his oath to execute faithfully the oflleo of President and to the best of his ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of tho 'United States. The faithful execution of the offlce of President nnd tho preservation, pro tection nnd defence of tho Constitu tion Includo certain functions which he admittedly cannot perform during an' absence of Indefinite durntlon-'nt n distance of three or four thousand miles. Ho offers no opinion from any Jurist or Jurisconsult, not even from his own Attorney-General, that his absence wlll not constitute that dis ability which automatically devolves the powers and duties of the Presi dent upon the Vice-President, Just ns surely ns when the President dies, Ho hns the boldness, or confidence In he supremacy of his Individual will, to tell the Congress that be will not bo "Inaccessible"; that he will "keep In touch" with it by cable and wire less ; that wherever on tho face of the earth he may bo ho will yet be "nvallablo for any counsel or service you may desire of me." A President conscious of approaching dissolution might similarly refuse to turn over his powers and duties to his desig nated successor oh tho ground that ho would still bo able, through expert nnd swift spiritual mediums, to com municate his views nnd exercise his official functions from tho other side of the dark river. As to the Wilson fourteen, in tho Interest of whoso promulgation nnd fulfilment ho abandons gome of the most distinctly defined duties of the law over him and the oath ho has taken, ho ndds not the slightest bit of information to what the public already knows. A policy which may Iks so shaped In the process of nego tiation as virtually to bind this repub lic to responsibilities revolutionizing our entire system ho now holds al most defiantly as his private and per sonal secret, doublo locked in his own head against acquisition by the coordinate department of the Gov ernment. Disclaiming any "private thought or purpose" of his own in performing his concealed errand, he gets no nenrcr to n definition of that errand than to describe it as trans lating Into nctlon "the great Ideals for which America has striven," ns "making good what they our sol diers havo offered their life's blood to obtain," as interpreting "the prin ciples and purposes of the country we love." This Is mere rhetoric und unsubstantial. All other features of the address, considered as an annual message by tho President to tho Congress on the state of the Union, fade Into com parative Insignificance beside this un paralleled assumption of almost au tocratic powers. Since our national history began there hns been nothing Hko the theory of n President's powers nnd duties here by him dis closed. Hlfl depnrturo unden such circumstances, nnd with so bold a defiance of the prevailing sentiment of tho country so plnlnly expressed at his own Invitation In the recent Congress elections, creates tho most Important Issue nnd raises the great est question now before tho American republic namely, the question ns to who Is legally the republic's Presi dent now thnt Mr. Wilson Is sailing away on tho Georgo Washington on n mission unknown to our Constitu tion nnd laws. This question Is obviously not for self-deterinliintlon by Mr. Wilson hut for tho Federal legislature In Its political nspects ami for the Federal judiciary In Its final phnse. Itrllef for Insnltent Fanners. Wo lmve received a letter from a render who seeks to engage our In- j tercst in ins pmu "to nnnnce tho in solvent farmer." After n study of this plnn ns Set forth In n reprint from the Farmers' Often Forum we frill to discover In It any merit not possessed by the plan now success fully operated by the Federal Farm I-oan Ilnnk, hut do find undesirable suggestions. One, as ue look nt the problem chiefly IfivbfVctt, flrihfiditi, condemns tho wfiofe plan. Tho writer proposes "thnt the national Govcrri- ment should supply, say, one-half of tho fund for this piirposo Iprovidlng for Insolvent farmcfSl, nnd thnt tho Stato In which tho colony is situated should supply the balance," Under such a scheme wo fear thnt thero would bo n surprising Increase In tho number of happy though "In solvent" farmers. It Is not unlikely that somo economists nblo to control their emotions might; venture tho sug gestion thnt n good way to finance nn Insolvent farmer w6uld bo to give him wages, board nnd lodging as h laborer on n farm whoso owner hnd not fallen into Insolvency. t Five Cent Telephones In Hotels. Probably nothing that could happen to a hotel proprietor abort of physical suffering would atlr tho sympathies of tho public now. Tho game 6f gouge they hnvo consistently practised, the arroganco of their demeanor toward complaints, have set all sorts of per sons against them. If they lament in creased costs, their patrons think of the hat and coat brlgnndngo; if they assert they cannot pay higher wages to waiters, the public remembers that It has been paying tho waiters for ycnrsAWhen n hotel proprietor talks of what ho "gives" his gue.sts, the guests, grown thoughtful of hitherto disregarded expenditures, think of what they have pnid to tho caehlors of the hotels. Why a- hotel should charge 100 per cent, more for a telephono cnll than trie cnll costs outside has never been made clear. The hotel must have tho telephone service. It is ns necessary to the convenient conduct of Its business rm a desk. It must also have a sys tem of Interior communications, and no hotel without telephones In its rooms would dare to call Itself up to date now. Yet tho hotel managers seek to convey tho Idea thnt lr lmr. lng public telephones nnd telephones in ttio rooms they are somehow con ferring n great boon on their pa trons, nt vast expense to themselves, and without return, Tho fnct Is, of course, that tho pa trons of hotels pay for everything In the hotel : for plumbing, lighting, car jiets, soap, stationery; pay for the corridors, the spaco given up to the mblic. for tho walls, the roofs, the watchman nt tho service entrance: for telephones too. If these things were not paid for by somebody tho notels would fall, nnd the only ner- -wms to pay for them nre the guests. Consequently, nobody Is going to heed the walls of nngulsh that pro ceed from tho hotels now because, under pressure, they have cut tele phono calls from ten cents to fie cents each. Instead, all patrons of hotels are going to speculate ns to tho menns which will be adopted by tho hotels to mnlntnln unimpaired their revenues. The hotels will find n way to extract their customary profit from tho public That Meeting Between Foch and rcrshlng. No newspaper man saw more of the war than Frederick Palmcb. the most experienced military correspondent new living. lie was with the allied p miles until America came Into the conflict, and from that time on he represented practically the whole press of the Tutted States In report ing the progress of the American Kxpedltlontirv Torre. As one of Gen eral Pr.nsiu.V- n.trf ho had oppor tunities enjoyed by no other Journal ist. Major Palmer's latest book, "America In France," Is Just off the presses, and there may be a natural curiosity to seo what ho says about a certain conference which, ns it was recently reported by the Itnltlniore Plttsburg gold brick twins was wreathed In nn atmosphere of pistols (tnd coffee. After the fourth German offensive, bringing tho enemy within forty miles of Paris, nil hopes were cen tred on the AmerlcntH. They were nrrlvlng in such large ntimbpr! thnt If the Allies could stem tho tide until August It was then June, and the Germans had been on the offensive since tho latter part of March Ger many's opponents would outnumber her on the western front. Our sol diers naturally were Impatient to get Into a great battle. As for Pkrsihno lilmeelf, Major Palmcb says: "Thcro could bo no flrjner advocate of thorough training than Genera! PiasitiMo; yet no foldler evor believed In swift, hard, aprgrciwlve Mows more Indomitably than he. lie la not a man of half way measures. I.utcr, lyhon German officers said that our army was methodical in preparation nrvd bold In action it wns merely nn oxprwalon of simple, ImmutabJo military principles." Major r.iLMrn gives It as hist own opinion that any soldier who looked nt the map In June could hnvo only ono thought, "and thnt was n drive nt tho hnso of the salient to close the mouth of tho pocket": "Neither reports of German stremtlli nor the defensive pplrlt of the tlmo di verted Ooncral PEnsitiNQ's attention from that invltlne bulge In the German battle line. When Premier Cumekcgai .tnd General Foch oamc to American headquarters on June "2 for a confer ence ho ngaln pointed to Its obvious vul neniblllty and vigorously advocated an offensive. He had faith thnt tho Ger man strength was overestimated, nnd that under a determined attack tho sal lent would crack like an ogir shell." But where- wero the troops for n great counter nttnek? Major Pai.mkr says that no stilllelent strategic reserve for such a purpose existed. It Is quite possible that tho French leaders uiudo the same point. Tlio American commander had n plan ! "Gen.

Behind them wore still other American divisions rapidly training, arid others arriving from America." Thero seems to have been nothing violent nbout General Pebsiuno's suggestion. No hint Is given in Major Palmer's businesslike account of the conference that ona General acted In such a manner as to bring to the other General thoughts of duelling. Quito the contrary t 1 "General Foon, who eravs the word for the attack, and Cleneral Pctain, who worked out the plana, both took General PsngntNO at his word." In other words, tho Generalissimo called upori tho American commander to consult with him, nnd being sat isfied with. General Persiuno's assur nncea relative to the condition of the American forces, went ahead with tho obvious strategy of tho hoiir, and, Instead of waiting until August, be gan suinshlng the German, on tho IStb of July, and kept on smashing lilin until his guns were forever silenced. Unfortunately, the week end war cor respondents from Baltimore and Pitts burg wero not silenced. The Death of Edmond Rostand. Tho news of tlio death of Eumond Host and, the French dramatist and poet, will bo received wltli deep re gret In this country. His works were more widely known nnd more highly nppreclated In America than In any other land except his own native France. One reason for this mny be the fnct thnt Ills drnmatlc productions, In which lils genius was bett displayed, wero given In America almost slmul tnneohsly with their presentation nt Paris ami by our most distinguished actors. "Cyrano do riergsrne" was one of tho most pronounced successes of the Into JticiiAsn Mansfielo, and his performance of the title rOlo was the most ndmlrnbie of his enreer. Miss Maude AnAMsmado us ac quainted with the exquisite beauties of tho "Chanteclcr" through her ex cellent prcsentntlon of the piece. Mine. nEBtnARtrr, whom wo came al most to claim for onr own stage, In "L'AIglon" had In this country the most successful tour of tlio lntter days of lier career. The fnmo of the author wns not alone through the stage presentation of his drntnntlc productions. Ills works were eagerly rend in the origi nal and In translations. Tho"Chnntc cler" perhaps had tho greatest popu larity In America; but "Cyrano," which one of his brother French dram atists pronounced "tho finest dra matic poem of n hnlf century," was very generally liked ami admired on account nf Its umistlnl brightness nnd brilliance. The world will gladly ncknowledge Rostand ns one of the geniuses of his time, a recognition which his country men gnve him by his election to the Acndemy nt the nge of 31, the young est man upon whom this distin guished honor wns conforred. In asking- for counsel Mr. Wilson might have suggested that the Senate send it to him by wireless.

DECEMBER- 9t llftt. i r-- ' - VI"' THti SOtflt, THE HORflt AND ME fAXEd -- A Correspondent Who Misunderstands What It Was the Hitching Did. to yhb Enirtn or Tub Sun" Sir; In your editorial article "Kltchln's Sectional Taxes" an attempt is made to show that, tnttlng the wealth of the various sections of the country as a basis for the distribution of tho national tax bur den, the Korthern section paid a larger amount of taxes into the national Trees ury In proportion to it wealth than did the Southern section. I will grant that upon Oibi basis the Sooth did get an advantage over the North, but Is It fair to tako wealth as the proper basis for the distribution of the tax burdon? I do not think so. The amount of wealth In a given section 1 only ono factor which produces Income, and maybe a very small faotor In Its production. Wealth Is a factor In pro ducing incoma only when It Is used In production nnd when tho productive process brings about an increase In the form of profit. Profit Is Income. And It generally arises from tho combined uso of these factors: Land, labor, capital, business organ Izntlon. Land yields rent. Labor yields wages. Capital yields interest nuslhess organization yields profit. Tho excesa Tecctpts of rent, wages. Interest nnd profits over the disburse ments of ench of theso are net Income, which tho Government under tho law taxes. Tlio mere possession of wealth may or mny not produeo Income. It would produce Incomn if efficiently and profita bly employed In a production whers Ifi brings about nn Increase It may be so employed ns actually to bring about a decrease, as where It Is Inefficiently used, resulting In Its loss and failures. Kor example: Two corporations organise In the fulled Stales to engage In the manufac ture of cotton cloth for sals In trie markets of 'the world, Itoth begin wljli n paid up capital of JlOO.OOO. This cap ital, of course, Is wealth, as It Is going to be used in production. One of these corporations locates In the fitato of Rhode Island, a Northern section, while the other locates In the State of Mis sissippi, a Southern section. They both begin at the, same time, nnd nt the end of the yenr the Jthode Island corporation shows a net Income from operation of J20.000, whllo tho NTIsslsslppI corpora tion shows n net Income from Its opera. Hon of $10,000, and nn a rosiilt of these showings the Ithodo Island company will pay more taxes Into the national Treas ury than the Mississippi corporation. The Rhode Island corporation will be enabled to declare a larger dividend than tho Mississippi corporation. What do these showings prove? Thy prove that perhaps one organization was better or ganized or better managed and Its direc tors used more Yankee brains than the corporation In the Southern section of the country. This argument holds good In case ot individuals. It Is not n question of how much wealth a given section possesses, bat It Is a question of how much Income thst wealth produces, nnd It is Income which tho Government taxes Tho facts are tlio Northern people have made more, nnd consequently are able to pay more, nnd If you apply tho theory of taxing the person who la most able to bear the burden, then you must conclude that tho amount of Income ac tually received. Irrespective of wealth, U tho fair basis ot taxation. F. C. IO.ir.ir. N'tw York, November 30. Pocs not Mr. Kliem make tho mls- tnko of confusing the dollar mark with the dollar's purchasing power? The Kitchlns made no such mlstnke. Tho Kitchlns knew thnt In Mis sissippi n dollar would convert Into twice ns much, perhaps threo times as much true wealth as In New York. Tho Kitchlns knew thnt, expressed In term of a dollar, rent that would cost n worker nnd his family In Mis sissippi, say, $15 a month would cost a worker and his family In New Yoi k, sny. $10 a month. ' The Kitchlns knew that whllo in th severe cllniatu of the North tho fuel of a family would cit from $."0 to 4100 in a. long, cold winter. It would cost In tho short,-soft winter of thn South $5 to $10. Tho Kitchlns know that for tho name reason tho clothing necessary to tho warmth and health of a family In the rigorous North would cert many times what Mifllelont cloth ing would owt In the nilKl South. Tho Kitchlns knew that a man's $2 wage In tho South would nlso buy moro vegetables, moro fruits, more food of nearly every kind than a man'H $4 to $5 wage would buy In New York. Tho Kitchlns know that by the name token the $1,500 Incomo In Mississippi would yield moro of the truo wealth necessary to man's comfort, health and well being thnn tho $3,000 Income would yield In Now York. In rigging their rrventto laws ko ns to raid the industry, the business nnd tho Individuals north of Muson and Dixon's, lino the Kitchlns never inn do tho mlstnke of thinking that tho truo economic test of pnillt. Inromo or wage was the mero dollnr murk rnthor thnn tho nctual wealth represented In na ture's teturns to effort, energy nnd enterprise, namely, thn shelter of a home, raiment and mihtenanro for the body, nil other articles not only of comfort but of refinement nnd physi cal and nientnl advancement. The Kltcluns knew that when they taxed in the North and West tho imn nf incomo '"st above $1,000, ho had In fnct, as the result of his helf-donlnl nnd his ltd' considerably lesi In every respett except tho mockery of the dol lar mark than tho man Just below $2,000 south of Mason nnd Dixon's line, who paid not n penny of tnx. This was not tho only way, as will he shown at tho proper time, In which tho Kitchlns deliberately contrived to rnld Industry, business and individuals north of Mason nnd Dixon's line. For the moment, however, It Is a eulllclont answer to anybody thinks the mero dollnr mark Is wealth or to anybody who does not realize that nn Inromo tax applied nllko by the mere dollar mark to nearly half a hun dred American States, all under differ, ent economic, social, climatic condi tions, run no more tax with equality, with Justlco or even with political de cency thnn a slnglo uniform dollar mark tax could npply to all the differ, ent nations, races nnd tribes in Ktt scpe, Asia und Africa.

Led by It, I walked twlco across the Balkan peninsula as a soldier of the Serbian army. 'I witnessed the tragedy of the Serbian people with all Its) pathos and horror. Tou will there fore readily understand how profoundly grieved I was when On November 34 I attended a solemn ceremony held In tho Cnthedrnl of St John tho Divine In celebration of the liberated nationali ties of middle Europe and observed that the Serbian flag was absent among the glorious flags of the triumphant allied nations. The place ot the Serbian flag was taken by that of the Jugo-SIavs. I felt deeply shocked. I could not believe my lye. What the combined efforts of Turkey, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria had failed to achieve the Teu tonic Jugo-Slava succeeded In accom plishing. The Jugo-SIavs must not forget that their flag Is the child of the war worn Serbian flag, and that tho Serbian peo ple sacrificed their all to llWato them from tho Auetro-llungarlan yoke. What is Serbia to-day? A war worn eaglet, bled white from many grievous woUhds. This flag, or rather the staff with the tattered remnants of tho flag attached to It, la nil that has been left to tho Serbian people. Its colors are the same as those of tha American banner, and It bears Uie samo motto, "For De mocracy, Truth and Freedom." Who will have the courage to deprive this eaglet of his last, his flag?

Henry Morgonthau, president of tho club, presided nnd spoke at length for the rohnhllltatlon of stricken Euro pean nations with tho aid of tiro United States. Qcn. J.

Ah a consequence tho basis of grave differences between Britain and ourselves Is likely to bo laid down at the peace table. Already the ques tion of the relative sizo of the British navy and our navy is being mooted. "Wo shall probably soon have a Iargur merchant fleet tliun Great Britain has. Necessarily we shall plnn to protect It. On the other hard, the British Kmplre, from dts very nnture. cannot let her nnvy be less than the navy of nny other nation. The contest In Rea power that, went on so long be tween Great Britain nnd Germany and finally culminated In this wnr Is about to bo transferred to tho British Empire and tho United States. Could anything bo more stupid not to say criminal?" Great npplauso.j 3Ir. Kingsley deprecated the idea of a l-cnguo of Nations.
