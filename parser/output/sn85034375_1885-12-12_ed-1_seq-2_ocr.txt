Troops B?ing Concentrated Westward, Their Destination Presumably Salt Lake City, Where Serious Trouble Is Said to be Brewing — The Mormons Clamoring for Blood Atonement—They May Get It. Omaha, Neb., December 6.—At an early hour yesterday morning General Howard, commanding the Department ol the Platte, received orders to send troops Irom Fort Omaha to some point which he refnses to make public. Artillery bat teries B and C, Filth Artillery, were ac cordingly ordered out and left yesterday afternoon on a special train for. the West over the Union Pacific. It is understood that all the remaining troops at Fort Omaha, consisting of ten compand ol infantry and one of cavalry, have beeu pul under orders to be ready to movi at a moment's notice. Inquiry al Union Pacific headquarters reveals the fact that the company has received instructions to have in immediate readiness additional special trains for the movement of those troops westward. General Howard has persistently refused to answer questions regarding the eles filiation of these troops. "My orders are strictly confidential," said General How ard to your correspondent, "and I car not possibly even intimate where these troops are going. It is of the utmost importance that the people of the com munity to which they are destined- shall not be apprised of their coming." It is evident that serious trouble is anticipated somewhere. General Howard intimated is much. The general conclusion Is that the troops of the department are all to be rapidly concentrated at Salt Lake, in an ticipation of an attack upon the Gentiles by the Mormons. Trouble of serious nature lias been brewing there for the last few days. The arrest, conviction and imprisomeut of Mormon leaders foi polygamy have not only aroused the Mor mons to great indignation and revengeful bitterness, but have caused them to re taliate by importing prostitutes from San Francisco and Denver and using these women to entrap Federal officials and prominent Gentiles. In this they have been partly successful, having caused a few arrests of tlie officials and Gentiles. One Deputy United States Mar shal was arrested . for fornication with one of these women, under the city charter. lie was taker by a writ of habeas corpus by the United States authorities, who declared tlie city ordinance invalid, because it exceeded the authority granted by tlie Legislature. The other night another Deputy Marshal was assaulted by what he called four Mormon assassins, one of whom he dan gerously shot. Tlie Mormons and their papers denounce this shooting as the act of an assassin,who made tlie first assault, md the Mormon press is calling for blood atonement. These are tlie causes that make Salt Lake a volcano to-day, liable to break forth at any moment. Threats have beeu made that the entire Gentile population will be cleaned out and excite ment and fears are increasing from day tc day. A dispatch received in Omaha from Salt Lake, in response to a telegram ol inquiry, says: "The inflamed condition of the public mind here is causing most serious apprehensions, and the move ment of the military is designed to pre vent the possibility of an outbreak and secure in advance tlie preservation of life and property. Troops cannot be concen trated Jiere any too quick to allay tin alarm anil excitement." Owing to General Howard's reticence regarding the destination of troops there is considerabte speculation as to w'hcre they are really going, but the great ma jority believe Salt Lake is the place with out doubt. Their destination is alleged by the officer to be Fort Fred Steele, in Wyoming, on the Union Pacific. Others intimate that it is Fort Lewis, in South ern Colorado, where there have been some disturbances among the Indians, and also among Apaches some distance from that post. General Sheridan it is stated, de sired to concentrate a large number of troops at that point to handle any serious outbreak which might take place in the Southwestern country. Another guess is that troops arc needed for labor troubles at Rawlins, Rock Springs and Evanston on the Union Pa cific, but railroad officials deny anything of tlie kind. It is also hinted that tlie troops are th go to tlie Pacific coast on account of Chinese troubles. So fur as Indian troubles arc concerned it 's not at all likely that artillery would be forw ard ed. The sending out ol the artillery con firms the general belief that Salt Lake is tlie destination or place of concentration, The troops at Fort Robinson, Neb., have been ordered to move to the West, and orders of similar character have been is sued to other posts in this department. Later.— It is a sure thing now that the troops from this department are-going te Salt Lake, and it is understood from good authority that trouble is looked for there.

At the cellar door she re quested Mrs. Phipps, who was In the room, to hold the lamp. No sooner had she opened the door than the gas rushed oat and ignited irom the lamp in Mrs Phipps' hands. A terrific explosion en sued, followed in quick succession by ex plosions in the collars of Flannery and Favllla. The noise was heard for squares away, and created the most Intense citement. Sheets of flames burst from the windows and doors of the wrecked houses. From within came the screams of the terrified women and children. A HORRIBI.K SIGHT. Several men worked their way through the Are into Mrs. Meehan's house, where a terrible sight met their gaze. Prone upon the floor, with every vestige ol clothes burned.froip her body, lay Kate Griffin, bleeding from a gash in her side Near her was Mrs. Phipps, wrapped in flames. Both women were picked up and carried from the burning build ing. It was found that Kate Grif fin was burned beyond all hopes of recovery. She was removed to the Homeopathic Hospital, where she now is lying unconscious. Mrs. Phipps is se verely burned, but her Injuries arc nol considered fatal. On the upper flooi of Mrs. Meehan's house were eight women and children; In Flan nery's, Mrs. Flannery and two babies, and in Favilla's Fuvilla and her nephew, J. E. Case. The fire spread so rapidly that they were rescued with difficulty, but all were finally taken out uninjured except Mrs. Flavilla and young Case, who were quite seriously hurt by falling debris. Mean while the Unities gained such headway that the three-story brick building was completely destroyed. The other houses were not entirely burned, but were so badly wrecked by the concussion that it will probably be necessary to tear them down. The news of the casualty in a few minutes caused the streets to be black with peoplo struggling, to get near the scene and ledrn the exact results. The wildest rumors prevailed. It was first stated that seventeen persons had been killed and injured, but when it was definitely ascertained that the victims seriously hurt numbered only two the ex citement gradually subsided and the throng dispersed. A short distance from the scene of the accident a faith-cure meeting was in progress. The explosion shook the building and created a panic, but all reached the street without injury. The loss will reach 830,000.
