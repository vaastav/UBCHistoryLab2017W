If the present deplorable car short age in the northwest were something new in the history of the country, there might be some ground for grave fears as to the future of the wheat growers of the state. But a refei ence to old newspaper files of twenty years ago shows that there was then the same scarcity of cars and the same inability to move the crops that is so much discussed today. It is a condition which deserves careful con sideration. But there is no need of converting it into a basis for dema gogry as is being done to some ex tent. It is of course charged that the railroads own the people and the gov ernments of the hard wheat produc ing states and that owning them, these common carriers are wilfully and intentionally neglecting to care for the grain which is offered to them as freight, and that because of this, the farmers are unable to market their crops and business is according ly being ruined. Measured by a common sense rule, this line of argument seems decidedly absurd. Railroads are built for the purpose of carrying the freight of their territories to its termination. The same people who are denouncing the railroads as negligent are also claiming that they are charging ex cessive freight rates for the handling of the wheat and other grains of the northwest. If the latter contention be true, it looks like the robber In stinct would induce these roads to do all in their power to handle the freight offered in the form of grain. If the roads are making a high profit on this class of material, why should they not use their best efforts to get as much of the stuff over the rails as possible? It might be urged that it makes no difference to the main lines engaged In carrying grains, as they control the situation and can haul the freight at the same prices at any time they may see proper. Suppose this were true. Unless there were some si«.e considerations, as a business proposition the roads would handle this class of freight now just as willingly as at any other time. President Hill claims that the cause lies in the fact that the termin al elevators are not able to handle th« grain as fast as the roads deliver it to them and that the cars are kept at the terminals for several days before they can be unloaded and are thus taken put Of service- This may or lftky not be true. If the cars of any common carrier engaged in interstate commerce are intentionally kept idle

The Evening Times has called at tention to the fact before that these car shortages occur in every part of the country which furnishes a large amount of outgoing freight at one time and comparatively little at oth er times. To properly handle the crops of the northwest as fast as they are delivered to the elevators in the fail and early winter would require ten times as much rolling stock as is required to handle the freight of the territory at any other time. The com panies are either compelled to allow the car famine to occur every year in this country or build an enormous number of cars which would be used probably one-fourth of the time and lie idle three-fourths. They seem to have preferred the latter course and an an nual car shortage results.

NO CHANGE OF CARS. Northern Pacific Tour ist cars can't be beat. Call on Northern Pacific Agents for reservations. If the contention of President Hill is correct, the situation can be some what relieved by increasing the ter minal facilities. But in the end it will be found that the farmers of the north west will be compelled in time to build their own elevators, either oa the farms or at the railroads, and store their grain until the roads are in condition to handle it It will be found in the end that this will be a blessing in disguise. By storing their crops they will be far better able to control the supply and create prices which will justify the raising of wheat and give them the profit on the same which their efforts deserve and the Investment demands. 

HOMESTEAD RESIDENCE. In charging a jury during the recent term of the United States district court in this city, Judge Amidon laid down some law relative to the resi dence required by the homestead laws which, if heeded by the homesteaders, would prevent much of the trouble some of them are experiencing as the aftermaths of final proofs. Judge Amidon distinguished be tween the shadow and the substance of residence between technical and actual residence. It is supposed by many that acts unaccompanied by in tent will establish and maintain resi dence. Nothing is farther from the idea of the law. Acts are merely evi dences of the intention. It has been supposed that if a homesteader built a shack upon a claim, put in a stove and bed, and slept a few nights there, he was maintaining a residence. Such is not correct, however. He may do these things and still not have a res idence. That is measured by his in tent. If when he did the act which was to constitute his establishment of resi- Another Northern Pacific Tourist Sleeping Car D. MULREIN, Atfent N. P. Ry. A NEW PICTURE OF UPTON SINCLAIR. The youthful author of "The Jungle." Upton Sinclair, who recently started co-operative colony at Helicon Hall, near Englewood, N. J., has received a great deal of public notice of late. His first notoriety was gained a few years ago when lie published a book purporting to be the actual diary of one Arthur Sterling, a poet who had failed to make his genius known to the world and finally, according to the "editor's" statement, jumped into the river. This book was fiction. "The Jungle." in which the horrors of Chicago meat packing bouses are exposed, gave Mr. Sinclair a ml reputation. dence, he relinquished all claims to a place of residence elsewhere and dur ing the time of such residence held it out to the world as his domicile and exercised in connection therewith all the rights and privileges which such domicile affords, he has maintained a residence upon the land within the meaning of the homestead law. Oa the other hand fictitious living upon the claim—even sleeping every night there—would not constitute ac tual residence if at the same time the rights and duties of the domicile were exercised elsewhere. Absence from the claim in the legi timate pursuits of business—if such as would occur in the same manner as it would if the residence were deeded property—would not vitiate the residence. It is the intent of the party to make the place his home at least for a fixed time, which actually constitutes his residence. The Evening Times has been charged with attempting to influence the appointments to be made by Gov ernor Burke. This is not correct. The Evening Times cares not one whit, so far as the political effect up on the democratic party is concerned, who receives the loaves and fishes. But it is not willing to have the cry of reform in state affairs proclaimed from the house tops and then sit idle by while the promises are swept away by the rush of the hungry for the pie counter, without letting (the public know of the same. For this reason it desires to call attention to the fact that one of the newspapers of the state which claims to speak for the new governor has announced that in the event of Engerud resigning from the supreme bench, he would appoint Judge Lauder to that position. It will be remembered that Lauder is one of the rankest partisans in the state, and while anyone would be an im provement on Engerud, it is not doing much to '"remove the judiciary from politics" to appoint a partisan like Lauder.

Last year, therefore, there was double the trade that there was in the most prosperous year under the Spanish regime. There were 210,273 tons of sugar exported last year of the value of $14,166,319 $3,555,163 of to bacco, and 28,290,322 pounds of coffee of the value of $3,481,102. Unfortun ately, what used to be Porto Rico's prime crop—coffee—has not shared this prosperity. It has never recov ered from the disaster of the hurri cane, and moreover, the benefit of throwing open our market to it has not compensated for the loss inflicted by the closing of the markets abroad. I call your attention to the accom panying memorial on this subject, of the Board of Trade of San Juan, and I earnestly hope that some measure will be taken for the benefit of the ex cellent and high grade Porto Rican coffee. In addition to delegations from th Board of Trade and Chamber of Com merce of San Juan, I also received delegations from the Porto Rican Fed eration of Labor, and from the Coffee Growers' Association. There is a matter to which I wish to call your special attention, and that is the desirability of conferring full American citizenship upon the people of Porto Rico. I most earnestly hope that this will be done. I cannot see how any harm can possibly result MR. HOTEL KAN Write for sample and price on onr special Hotel Blend Coffee. This should benefit you.

They are loyal, they are glad to be under our flag, they are making rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride in what they have done, and our pleasure in extending recognition for what has thus been done, by granting them full American citizenship. Under the wise administration of the present governor and council, marked progress has been made in the difficult matter of granting to the peo ple of the island the largest measure of self-government that can with safe ty be given at the present time. It would have been a very serious mis take to have gone any faster than we have already gone in this direction. The Porto Ricans have complete and absolute autonomy in all their munic ipal governments, the only power over any kind results from it, and great benefit to the island, and it should certainly not be changed at this time. The machinery of the elections is ad ministered entirely by the Porto Rican people themselves, the governor and council keeping only such supervision as is necessary in ordr to insure an orderly election. Any protest as to electoral frauds is settled in the courts. Here again it would not be safe to make any change in the pres ent system. The elections this year were absolutely orderly, unaccom panied bv any disturbance: and no protest has been made against the management of the elections, altho three contests are threatened where the majorities were very small and error was claimed the contents, of course, to be settled in the courts. In short, the governor and council are cooperating with all of the most en lightened and most patriotic of the people of Porto Rico in educating the citizens of the island In the principles of orderly liberty. They are provid ing a government based upon each citizen's self-respect, and the mutual respect of ail citizens that is, based upon a rigid observance of the prin ciples of justice and honestly. It has not been easy to instill into the minds of people unaccustomed to the exer cise of freedom, the two basic prin ciples of our American system the principle that the majority must rule and the principle that the minority has rights which must not be disre garded or trampleo upon. Yet real progress has been made in having these principles accepted as elemen tary, as the foundations of successful self-govrnment I transmit herewith the report of the governor of Porto Rico sent to the president through the secretary of state. All the insular governments should be placed in one bureau, either in the Department of War or the Department of State.
