MEXICAN 1 VOL 50. SANTA FE NEW MEXICO, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1915. NO. 251. I 9 y WILSON'S TALK IS PROVED TRUE DEVELOPMENTS OF PAST 36 HOURS IN MEXICO REGARDED AS PROOF OF PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT THAT THE HUERTA REGIME WAS CRUM BLING LITTLE BY LITTLE. FEDERAL GENERALS FLEE TO I). S. 

BORDER Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. The flight of Huerta's generals In North ern Mexico, federal evacuation of Chihuahua and Guaymas and the re fusal of Mexican oil companies to fur nish fuel for movement of federal troop trains, were pointed out by of ficials here today as such events to which President Wilson referred in his message to congress yesterday when he declared the Huerta regime was crumbling "by a little every day". Diplomatically there have been no developments. President Wilson's statement, that this government, would not in his opinion, be obliged to alter its policy of "watchful waiting" was regarded as forecasting a period of passive observation, with every eye of the government exercising at the same time a close scrutiny on the safe guarding of foreigners and their prop erty. Some diplomatists were inclined to see in President Wilson's expresssion of hopefulness that when Huerta had been forced from power, in which or der would be restored "by the concert and energy of such of Mexico's lead ers as prefer the liberty of their peo ple to their own ambition an answer to the frequent inquiries In the fo reign press as to whether chaos and anarchy would result If Huerta re tired. Diplomatic officials here had ho ad vices to support published reports that Queen Wilhelmina, speaking for the Hague Tribunal, had addressed a peace proposal to Huerta. State de partment officials were confident that Ihe United States would be notified hefore any such proposal was made. ' Although the fetate tsmJ navy, depart ments were without official advices over night, unofficial reports that seven federal generals in northern Mexico were ready to surrender to the constitutionalists, were read with keen Interest. Seven generals of the Mexican reg ular army are ready to surrender and the backbone of the Huerta dictator ship in the north has been broken. A peace commission arrived in Juarez lust night bearing terms of surrender. The peace commission was headed hy Odilon Hernandez and came from Chihuahua bearing a proclamation signed by General Salvador Mercado, Huerta's military governor and com mander of the federal force in all the north. The proclamation stated that the Huerta government was bankrupt and was unable to pay its soldiers. The simultaneous evacuation of other federal strongholds in the north is believed by the rebels to be the re sult of a concerted decision to aban don the whole of northern Mexico- The peace proposals were sent by General Mercado to Gen. Francisco Villa, rebel leader, through Frederico Moye, civil governor of Chihuahua, ' appointed ad interim. Along with it ; came an appeal signed by all the for eign consuls in Chihuahua calling upon Villa to give police protection to the citizens of Chihuahua city. General Mercado's proclamation ; said: "Under the circumstances which have existed in Chihuahua it has been deemed necessary for the federal troops to evacuate. I leave It in charge of Federico Moye, a person who Is not identified with politics and who is therefore qualified to give full protection to foreigners. It is im possible to remain here longer as there is no money with which to pay the troops." The generals who have signified through General Mercado their will ingness to surrender, but who, never theless, are fleeing to the United States border are: Gen. Salvador Mer cado, Gen. Pascual Orozco, Gen, Jose Ynez Salazar, Gen. Marcello Caraveo, Jen. Jose Manzilla, Gen. Bias Orpinel aH Gen. Manuel Laudo. Trying to Intercept Federals. Juarez, Mex., Dec. S. Confident that the seven federal generals who evacuated Chihuahua city with the troops intend to seek refuge iu the United States and thus be beyond dan ger of being taken prisoners by the rebels. General Francisco Villa today sent more constitutionalists to attempt to intercept them. The generals, led by General Salvador Mercado, whose desertion of Chihuahua and whose statement that he had no money to ' pay his troops is regarded as a vir tual breakdown of the Huerta dictator ship so far as the north of Mexico is concerned, are headed for Ojinaga on the border. It is thought they will cross the river to Presidio. At Presi dio, they are expected to be arrested by the United States military au thorities, taken to Marfa, and thence to San Antonio. Their arrest on cross ing the river would follow as a mat ter of course under a ruling of Secre tary of War -Garrison-With the generals are many subor- dimue officers, about 2,000 federal regular soldiers, and more than 1,000 people of the wealthier class of Chi hunhua, who took flight rather than face an attack by the rebels. General ' Pascual Orozco and General Jose Ynfz ! Salazar, believed to be w ith Mercado, j are under Indictment returned in the ! United States court In Kl Paso tor vio lation of the neutrality law. Salazar is out on bond, but Orozco never was arrested. Villa has little hope that his sol diers would be able to overtake the federals who left Chihuahua several days before the fact of their flight he camp known. That Mercado, after handing over the portfolio of state to Frederic Moye civil governor ad interim, should offer to surrender on behalf of himself and his subordinates and then fly to the border, was regarded by Villa as an unusual procedure. No Comment by Carranza. Hermosilio, Mex., Dec. 3. General Carranza declined today to comment on the news from Juarez that several federal generals were sending commis sioners to treat with the revolution ists. "Yon will see whether I receive them when the time comes," said the constitutionalist commander. The news that Chihuahua had offered it self as a rebel prize was received with satisfaction by constitutionalist lead ers who considered it proof of the failing of General Huerta's military power. There was some doubt as to Car ranza's attitude should the federal commanders wish to ally themselves with the revolutionary movement. At the beginning of the present revolu tion Carranza allowed 30 days in which lie would accept such offers. The only former federal army offi cer prominently connected with the revolution is General Felipe Angeles, secretary of war in Carranza's provi sional cabinet. He was one of the few regular army generals who up held President Madero and never rec ognized the Huerta government. Columbia Gets Back Up. Mexico City, Mex., Dec. 3. The Co lumbian congress severely criticises former President Roosevelt in a com munication cabled to the Mexican sen ate and chamber of deputies today. It arraigns Colonel Roosevelt and the governmental methods of the United States. The communication was sent, it was explained, "as a protest against, intermediat'.on in Latin-American af fairs by the colossus of the north." The communication was considered in secret session at which it was de cided to lay it on the table.

Prcsi-1 ident Wilson's recommendation for di- jrect primary election of presidential candidates came up in tlia senate to Idav in a debute that held the body for more than an hour, during which Sen ators Bristow, Cummins and others expressed the hope that Democrats would follow the president in support of a reform which, they declared, Pro gressive Republicans long had de manded.

Water ten feet deep flowed through the principal streets of east Waco today while the Brazos river flood passed all previous stages and continued to rise. The east Waco section began flooding last night when a levee gave way. There was no loss of life. Policemen aud firemen worked all night getting men, women ana cnu dren safely out of east Waco. The main business thoroughfare ot east Waco today was a mill race from end to end and business houses and residence in the deepest part of the flood remained unmoved, but some of th liehter structures appeared to be In no position to withstand a far ther rise of the flood. Large areas in South Waco, includ ing the Cotton Palace exposition grounds, were inundated today, the water varying from one to ten feet in depth.

DenveY, Dec. 9. The formal call for a convention of representatives of ev ery labor nntou in Colorado, to meet in Denver December 16, was issued to day by John McLennan, president, and W. T. Hickey, secretary of the State Federation of Labor. The con vention is called to consider and de cide the question of calling a state wide sympathetic strike in support of the United Mine Workers of America, whose members are now on strike in the Colorado coal fields. The letter, which was sent to every labor organization, declares that the strike of the miners has grown to a real war in which every craft and de partment of organized labor is threat ened with annihilation unless they take a positive stand for their rights." It declares that the uniform of the state militia is "again being disgraced and turned into an emblem of anar chy." That the state militia is being used to bring in strike breakers in vio lation of the state law and that the cost, is being "paid by the workers" in taxes and the increased price of coal (Continued on Page Four.) 27 ARE

Th news that General Salvador Merca do, commander of the federal forces in northern Mexico, has sent a mili tary peace commission from Chihua hua to Juarez to treat with the rebels, while vigorously denied in official cir cles, is regarded as the most Beriou blow yet struck at federal prestige. In view of Provisional Huerta's statements that he never would treat with the rebels it Is considered im possible that the peace commission has been sanctioned by him. At the same time however, it is pointed out that the appointment of the commis sion is in line with the suggestion made by Dr. Aurelio Urrut.ia when at the head of the ministry of the inte rior, that overtures might be made to the rebels without government sanc tion.

Remark able progress in military sanitation ind Improvement in the health of the army Is recorded in the annual report of Surgeon General George H. Torney. The surgeon general says it seems more than marvelous that among the number of men in the camps at Texas City and Galveston and along the Mexican border constantly exposed to Infection, not a single case of typhoid has occurred. That is attributed en tirely to the compulsory immunization of the army by the typhoid prophylactic. GIVEUPKOPEOF FINDING MINERS ALIVE VOLUNTEERS STILL AT WORK CLEARING AWAY DEBRIS IN GOLDEN CYCLE MINE, ALTHOUGH ALL THREE ENTOMBED MEN ARE BELIEVEO TO BE DEAD. INDIAN WARRIORS SMILE PEACEFULLY S THEY FACE JUDGE W. H. POPE Wearing Bcarlet blankets around their Bhoulders, turquoise in their ears, red bands around their raven locks, and a broad smile seaming their wea ther beaten countenances, the eight Indian braves from the Navajo reser vation, whose resistance to arrest biought out the V- S. cavalry recently. walked peacefully into V. S. District Judge Pope's court at 2:35 o'clock this afternoon. The Indians were accompanied by Deputy II. S. Marshal J. R. Galusha, Chee Dodge, the best Interpreter on the reservation, and Father Webber, the well known missionary of St. Mich aels, Arizona. The approach of the Indians caused quite a flurry in the federal building, not because of any fear of an uprising, but on account of the- dazzling cos tumes The eight warriors looked Indeed formidable, their broad shoulders, powerful jaws, piercing eyes and reso lute countenances causing every one who looked at them to mutter: "These are the real sons of nature who live in the wild." All eyes were turned ou the veteran leader of the group Bizh-osh-l, whose withered frame told of the seven and seventy winters he had seen and whose hair was silvery with the events he had lived through. Blzh-osh-i is a medicine man, the only one in the group of eight Navajos, and his words of wisdom are listened to with the awe given the physician all over the world. It is said that he is the one who was last to yield to the suggestion of Cbee Dodge to surren der. Curious Names. The names of the other warriors are also interesting. They are: Bega, the medicine man's son; Hosh Tali, Tom Dale, No Do Willie. He Baly, Hah Tot Le Yazzie, No Do Wille Bega and Att City Nez Bega. These Indians and their medicine man-chief held the day before at Noels, San Juan county, with Briga dier General Hugh L. Scott, Father Webber and Interpreter Chee Dodge. They then traveled to Gallup where they took the train early this morn ing for Albuquerque, thence to Santa Fe. With the surrender of these Indians against whom United States District Attorney Summers Burkhart had filed informations in the federal district court, all show of opposition to gov ernment authority was abandoned by the others. The Shiprock agency is aB peaceful now as If the braves had never dreamed of a return to the war path of their forefathers. The younger Navajos have returned to the agency school and the traders, who have stores at isolated points on the reserv ation are distinctly relieved. General Scott leaves Gallup today for Fort Bliss to rejoin his command, going by way of Albuquerque. The squadron of tlie Twelfth cavalry, sent to the Shiprock agency from Fort Robinson. Neb., is expected to arrive in Albuquerque Friday or Saturday. The troops will entrain for Kl Paso, also going by way of Albuquerque. Orders fo rtheir movement to the bor der were received while they were in the field against the Navajos. The troops experienced difficulty in reaching the Beautiful Mountain country, owing to Hie taut that their wagon train was mired. They will return by easy marches. In U. S. Court. The eight Indians who are now V. S. prisoners, seemed to be much inter ested in the court room and gazed for minutes at the high ceiling, large win dows and the court furniture. Judge Pope had a whispered conversation with Father Webber and Chee Dodge, during which the Indians looked per fectly at ease, smiling broadly at those who looked at them. At 3 o'clock the judge asked if At torney FranciB C. Wilson had arrived at court. As the New Mexican went ta press, the Indians were In consulta tion with Mr. Wilson, who was ap pointed to defend them. They will be arraigned tomorrow morning. Cripple Creek, Colo., Dec. 3. With out hope to find alive any of the three men caught in Monday's slide in the Golden Sycle mine, volunteers today continued the task of digging their way through yesterday's second slide.

The war department today announced that Gen eral Arizmendl and other federal of ficers who fled from Ciudad Victoria to Cerritos in the state of San Luis Potosi had been ordered to re-organise . their forces and to march against Vic toria. Tills task had first been , en trusted to General Navarrete, who retreated to Monterey after his fail ure to relieve the hard pressed gar rison of Victoria.
