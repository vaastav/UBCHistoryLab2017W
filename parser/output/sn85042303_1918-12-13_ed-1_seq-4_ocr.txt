TUESDAY'S A RDM OK KITE contained an article headed "Here Is the Chance For You to Aid Others," which we trust was read and digested by many persons who have means to spare ior those who are less fortunate. In that article the urgent needs of Ardmore's poor were set forth. It should not he forgotten, while we are raising funds for Ked Cross work overseas, that right here at home there is suffering which pleads for mitigation. Kind words will help some, but old King Dollar will help more. The llenevoleiit Association now is engaged in rais ing a winter fund for the benefit of the sick and needy. John F. Kasky is city chairman, ami bis telephone "number is 251. He can give you all the additional information you may require. If you have not read the article in Tuesday's paper you should read it now and act accordingly. Ardmore has an angel of mercy, a mother to the little poor and a big sister to the woman who is sick .mil needy, .'-'lie is Mrs. Julius Kahn. Many of you know her and know something of her work for the home-town unfot tunates ; but none of you can know all of what she h.n done and is doing and wants to do if she can have the funds with which to do it. The r.inevolent Association co-operates with Mrs. Kahn in her labors of mercy. It is for you to co-operate with th' J'.enevob.iu Awuiat urn and help Mrs. Kahn and other good women help llio-e ubo need help. This appeal k made nol only to ciliens of Ard nioie, but also l.i the many well-to-do people of Cur ler county, to whom this city U I be local melropolis. 1 1 is not one of iIhim- appeals to be read and passed up, or passed along to the other lellow.

THE AKDM OREITF. has received the follow ing interesting letter; Ardmore, Due. 8. Editor Daily Ardmorcitc: Your editorial in your Sunday paper on "Lit tle Willie's Renunciation" smells more than the dirty streets of Ardmore that you are inviting him to clean. Arc you trying to bring a dirty brute like William to the level of an honest working man? The street cleaning department is just as honorable as printing a newspaper, and I think it is more beneficial and serviceable. Why not Invite him to sling mud in your office? I think the brute would make good at that, Now, please don't mention manual labor and William any more than you can help, as we be lieve that manual labor stands as high and will stand as good inspection as any profession you might follow. This is from some workingmen of Ardmore. Print this if you want to. Yours truly, CHARLES JOHNSON'. P. S. This is not the first time that we have noticed your disrespect for a workinginati, but when you bring him down to the level with Wil , liam it's time to take notice. The Ardmorcite is pained because Mr. Johnson takes offense at the playful' editorial wherein we in vited the ex-crown prince, who had said he would be willing to do manual labor, to come to Ardmore and pick up the paper littering certain streets. As we. pointed out, "scraps of paper" are strictly in the Ilobenzollern family line. Of course we had no ser ious intention of putting "Little Willie" in competi tion with honest American workingmen, nor of insin uating that he is in their class in any sense whatever. And, as for this paper showing disrespect for woik ingmen, we are willing to wager the price of a Ked Cross membership that the man who wrote the Little Willie" editorial has done as many kinds of manual labor as Mr. Charles Johnson ever has done, no mat ter what his lines of work may be or may have been heretofore. The man who wrote that editorial has done everything that is to be done on a farm; he ha; driven a team of Missouri mules attached to a road - scraper; he has shoveled gravel from a we I creek bed and dumped it upon the highways and smoothed it off; he has dug ditches, done carpentering, washed di.hes, set type and various other things which mav be termed manual labor, and he has been a member of a trade's union in good standing. The Ardmorcite has high respect for workingmen of all kinds who do their work well. Mr. Johnson should take a day or so off and learn how to appre ciate a joke. We learn that Australian commercial and financial interests are making plans to connect Australia with London and other parts of the l!iiii-li empire by com mercial airplanes. Wonder bow oldlitue England would feel to know that the descendants of the con victs she deported' to the farr-off island continent were flying back to the motherland? o This is the day you should turn in that dollar lor Christmas Red Cross membership. The membership ,vill last a whole year much longer than the dollar. . o The breweries are to be turned into vast plants for drying fruit and vegetable;; but the late of the prctel factories still hangs in the balance.

With a unanimity of purpose lhat evidences carefully matured plot ting, the partisan critics have been yelping at the president's heels con tinually ever since the first definite signs of German defeat came in the opening of overtures for an arm istice. They denounced each dip lomatic step he took to dissolve the kaiser's government and bring about abject Herman surrender. Victory assured, they unmasked at tack ujioii the conditions which the president had formulated and the world had enthusiastically accepted for the making of a peace. Embedd ed by the people's passive tolerance of tl'tis abuse of I heir leader, they proceeded to work themselves up into a fine frenzy over the presi dent's announced intention person ally to participate in the Peace ( in ference and bis selection of his fel- low commissioners. And dually, when the president dcliwivd In parting message to congress on Molida'v- one of the finest and ablest 'stale papers ever presented to an American congie-s- thry in dulged in such an orgy of futile and pnerle misrepresentation and cal nunation as alarmed the saner member; of their own parly, and the ineil.ible teaction set in.
