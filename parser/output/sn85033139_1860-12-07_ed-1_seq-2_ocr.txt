THE PILOT. MANITOWOC: Fill DAY MO li NT NO, DEC’R 7, 1800. Germans in the United States. The New Voik Daily News pays a handsome compliment lo the German peo- ; pie. While the German element in the United States, it gays, “ has contributed a bulk of population numbering n. ill ions upon millions of its staunchest and its best citizens, to this Republic, it has every where been felt in the spread of all that graces and adorns our social life. Their ar ialic and engineering genius has enam eled our plans wi h the beautiful products of the garden, and laid them with the iron pathways of progress; our wild fields they Lave covered with flowers and grain, and the mountain sloj • s they have planted ; with oinainental groves and treilme i with ; the vine; they have designed and built, many of our finest edifice*, including | school houses an 1 churches, embellishing , them with their frescoes and paintings, | and the rich tracing of their chisels, and filling them w rh a music, which, of itself, 1 is a Divine presence, and a revelation. — j from the banks of the Penobscot l<* the j tut bid Sacramento, every where the tourist ; finds the ii.ark of the German's skill and i taste and enlcrpine.

The Into accounts from Europe repre sent the position of the King of Naples as growing every day more desperate. He was cooped up in Gseta; his forces had been again defeated, and 15,000 of them destroyed or taken j ri-oners. Another division of 15 000 had been cut off from the main ho.lv, and took refuge in the Pa pal territory, where they laid down their arms. The French fleet had been w i ii drawn from Greta, and as the Sardinians ran imw attack the place from sea and land, its speedy fall was inevitable.

The news from China says the Allied armies were marching on Pekin, where the Chinese were waiting to give them battle. A dispatch from Calcutta savs that symptoms of disaffection are manifested by theGth European Regiment at Dinapore. Trin PiiK-tDENI’s Message. Congress met on Monday, and the annual message o f President Brenanan was probably de Jivered on T uesday or Wednesday of ibis w.'eek. Owing to the unfortunate state of our national affairs, all will he eager to obtain it as early as possible in order ;o ascertain the views <-f the President. We shall publish it in the n-xt number of the Pilot. It is now generally believed that n dissolution of the Cabinet will follow the delivery of i*. J.dgs Douola- i> 1804. The fleino cratic press of the country every where is rai-ing the war-whoop for Douglas in 1804. The Mobile R oister predicts his fiuuipli ns follow s : “The triumph of Judge Douglas in hi? truly national and patriotic position is ns certain as that trnth prevails over error, lie will he the next President of the Uni ted States if he lives, and go in as Ceriwra!

We caon< t v< uch for the truth of this statement, but give it f<>r what it is worth. Proceedings or tub Hoard.—We de vote nearly the whole of our first page to the proceedings of the P ird of Sujervi t ns. and re' the en I has not com • American Elections. Dr. Cahill, the talented Irish Scholar and eminent Catholic Divine, iu our read ers know, has keen traveling in this coun try lor a year pa*t, lecturing on Astrono my and other subjects, and writing his opinions of our country and its institution.* to the Dublin Ttl> graph. These letters are very interesting, and are copied into ail the Irish American Journals. The fol lowing extract fr<>rn his letter dated Rome, A etc York, previous to the recent election, will give our people an inkling of his idea on “ universal suffrage.’' He says : The approaching contest fur the elec tion of a President for the United States is most interesting to me, as it furnishes the practical working of vote by ballot and again of manhood qualification. The parties or factions here are like those of other countries swayed to the right or to the left, or driven backwards or forwards according to religions, or political, or com mercial Lias; and moderate, or intern perate, or fierce, or weak, or powerful, ac cordir g to the stamp of the leaders who direct t lie masses. In this country there 5s on those occasions much talk and blus ter; hut seldom any injurious violence.— Lord Palmerston in speaking of his Araer ican cou-ins (as he calls them) says “ they are everj iwing but never gve a blow.”— When one rea ls the public electioneering prints, or witnesses the torchlight election eering processions which are continually held, the foreigner can expect no result except party sanguinary conflicts wherever these political opponents may chance to meet. Hut on dose examination of the habits of this country ; and on personal observation <>f the conduct of the assem bled thousands, the foreigner is soon re lieved from his menacing anticipations; and lie feds the truth of Palmerston's | saving—namely, that no disorder, no i breach of the ('"mt'u-iounl law of the Union, will follow (he most bois’erous ex hibition of electioneering enthusiasm. As the day for the universal voting ap proaches, the storm of words increases; I clouds of angry rhetoric are ever seen I gathering in the pofi’icai horizon ; theelo I qttent thunder of stump and forensic ora- \ lory is heard fiom North to South ; tla-hes i of abolitionist lightning are observed dart I ing through the skies from Boston to Philadelphia; flairs, banners,drums, trum pets, are board from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and the American hemisphere ! seems to appro ch a state of chaos him] [ dissolution. Vv heu to Ia slit opens in a balloting box like the slit in a post-office window ; the voter appears —puts in his voting card. The moment this process is terminated, the storm as if bv the wand of a magician begins to abate; the skv be comes clearer; the sun of ti e next morn ing ri-es ; and a sudden calm reigns over : all minds, all hearts, all tongue-, till news ( papers; an 1 all America being suddenly changed into peace and quiet, begins again on the following day as if vote by ballot, or manhood suffrage, or the Amer ican President had never ex'sted either dc jure or de facto in the Western hern 1 sphere 1! I Surely, then, if such a tern pest of American political thunder and llfirmning cun Lo i .l**y into a perfect calm, your little Irish hurricane in the event of your ever obtaining the 1 onesfc, the nnpetjured right of vote bv ballot) can be appeased between morn and sunset on whatever day v our island storm m tv arise. The secret of tin- political magic is the tact 'hat the people th.-m-elves evoke the ; tempest, and a.lay it in their constitutional ! right. Hence they commit no violence I against their own rights.

CAHILL. The Esasoa Why. 1 hged as Mr. Lincoln lias been to make some avowal of the policy he will pursue ; with reference to the institution of slavery 1 much wonder is expressed that he remains :so obstinately mum. The follow ing from the New \ urk Tim which paper seems j to speak more by authority than any otli jer as to Mr Lincoln’s views and ii.ten lions, may afford some clue to the motives of his silence: He is simply a citizen of the United Stale*, a* any other, without office, and without ab-olute certainly of occupying *i e Death, or revolution, or a failure of the Electoral College to select him, may either <>!' them intervene to prevent his rea< hing the 1 *res denev ; AND 1N FA< T ANY I TT FRANCE HE MIGHT NEED LESSLY, AND, INDEED, PItESUMP- I PUL'SLV M \KE AT ITHS MOMENT, MIGHT ITSELF DEFEAT LIS ELEC TION.” So he would rather risk national disun ion than personal defeat.

In our last paper we published an ac count of the loss of the Propeller Daco'nh near Buffalo, two weeks ago; and wit! deep regret we now mention that C'apl. Cross, her commander, with all his crew, met with an untimely death. C’apt. Cross was an old resident of Milwaukee, and is a brother of J. B. Cross, President of the Juneau Bank. llis experience, as a navi gator on the Lakes, extended through u long period of years, and all con ur in the belief that no one belter calculated to fill the station or more honorable in bis deal ings with men, ever paced a deck. He was esteemed by all, and was tire recipient of the confidence of every one who knew him. He bad many friends in Manitowoc who mourn the loss of an accomplished seaman and noble hearted man. From the Buffalo Republic of the 27th we have the following particulars; The Dacotah had on board twenty four persons, w hose names are as near as can be ascertained, as follow s : W. S. Cross, captain; G. C Klutnph, Ist mate; Samu el Boyce, Ist engineer; Win. G Lee, 2d do; Anthonv Kilkoyne,fireman: A. Ken nedy, watchman; John Ilandrahan, por ter ; and the 2d mate and nine deckhands of whose names, owing to some changes which had recently been made, we were not informed. There were also on board a portion of the crew of the propeller Marquette, that had been laid up here, and her crew were returning to (heir homes in Chicago. Their names are: Passen gers—Shder. Morton, Smith, Milton and Flagg, all sailors; and one Jared, a resi dent of Milwaukee. From Capt. Dorr, who returned from tl.e wreck of this ill fated vessel this morning, we learn the following particu lars. The vessel struck on Saturday night, probably about nine o’clock, on a reef a short distance from the shore, one mile above Sturgeon Point, on the American side of the lake opposite Mr. Bennett's home. On Saturday night, about nine o’clock, Mrs. Bennett and her son heard some per son hallooing, they both went outside with Mr. Bennett ‘.be elder, and looked around fur half an hour, hut amid the driving of the storm could hear nothing, so they concluded that they were mistaken, but so impressed was Mrs. Bennett that she heard someone shouting in the direction of the beach, that she sent her son at day light down to look, and he at once came upon portions of the wreck. A part of the hull, and probably the machinery, an chors, chains, A:c., lie off oirside a little distance, probably where she broke tip. — The whole of the starboard side lies up, high and dry, s me twenty feet from the water. The timbers separated where they joined the keel. The balance of the wreck and cargo are strewn along the beach for a distance of several miles, most of the debris in small pieces. The life boat, near ly peifeet, lies directly opposite the house *f Mr. H. nnett. lu the rear of Lis house, ami towards the lake, is a ridge of land b uds. Tunning along the inside base of which is a deep creek. il uiav ue pussioic iim. o. „. . .some oilier person came ashore alive in j that boat, and climbed over the Bluffs i making their wav towards the Ihditof Mr Bennett s house until coming to the creek —a perfect trap —fell in and was drowned, and that the person or persons heard to halloo by Mrs Bennett and son. It is feared this was the case, hut it may j rove all surmise. Capt. Dorr and party were on the beach with lanterns the earlv part of the night. Three bodies have been fun land a Coronet’s inquest held on them by Coroner Be'ey and a jurv. (>ne of them was identified as Barlhole mew MacM mitt, deck hand, he was paid off from Prop. Chicago by Capt. Collins, on I riday night. Another was identified as Edward Kennedy, a watchman, he had been on the boat some time; the third man was evidently a deck hand but could not be identified. He had on his person a small gold watch, Kennedy had fiftv nine dollars in money on him. Mac Mama had no valuables on him, and no clothing but his shirt. Capt. Dorr left Capt. Thomas, Marine Ins r lector, Capt. Collins, of Prop. Chicago, and Capt. Gaylord, of Prop. Equinox, at the wreck to pick up any bodies that mav come ashore, and protect the property, in conjunction with the Coroner. From the same paper we obtain addi tional information, together with those having goods on board ; We learn from S. Pease. Esq., who re~ turned this morning from the wreck of the Dacotah, that over one hundred men are stationed along the shore, to secure the cargo and bodies of those lost who aie washed ashore from the w reck. Up to last night five bodies have heen found, two more in addition to the three we gave an account of yesterday. One of them was the colored cook of the Mar ■ jiiette, and the other a sailor who was not recognized by any one present. i.arge quantities of the cargo and pieces <>f the wreck are continually being washed ashore for miles along the beach, Mr. Pease thinks that the propeller must have struck the reef some mile or more from where portions of the hull now lie, and gone to pieces on it, and from there the wieck was washed bv tlie waves down. 1 tom a gentleman who came down on the State line Railroad, leaving Evans this ! morning, arriving here at 11 ;50, we learn i hat during the night another body \va wa-hed ashore making now six in all. He saw the body, I ut no one recognized it.— Fie says the wreckers are at work night and day watching the coast. A isconsin Man is the Ualiforma Sen ate. Due of the two State Senators just elected in San Franci-co, is Mr. James McM. Shatter, formerly of Sheboygan in this Slate, and Speaker cf the Assembly during one sesiion. He was the whig can- j didate for Congress in this District in 1852 an.l was beaten by John H. Mact. A New Postmaster.—Geo. A. Lamb has been appointed Postmaster of Chilton, v ice, E. Glck resigned. A first rate ap pointrnenf. So says tbw The Wreck of the Wabash Valley. Capt Goodrich, the owner of this ves -el, which went ashore at Muskegon, on Thursday morning, the 22d ult., furnishes the Chicago Times and Herald with the following account ot it; The Wabash Valley left Milwaukee for Grand Haven on Wednesday, the 21st uit, it half past eight p. m, w ind light—west southwest. Captain Morgan shaped the course, allowing three quarters of a point lee wav, and gave charge of the deck to the male at 12 o’clock (midnight.) During the night the boat made very good weather, and tier usual time, although the wind had freshened ; sea increasing ail the time. At three a. m. made the light, wheu the mate called Captain Morgan.— He immediately came on deck, asked tire usual questions as to how lie made the light, Ac; at the same time he thought he saw the light flash, which he has rea son to believe since was caused by a vessel that passed under his bows; and went ashore about that time; he felt confident that it was Grand Haven, anti was more assured by the range lights than anything else. The range lights at Muskegon are simi lar to those at Grand Haven; but not hav ing been lighted during the summer, and having been so on this particular occasion deceived them. The Captain is as well acquainted with the shape of the land and the genera! appearance of things in the vicinity of Mu-kegon and Grand Haven, as any man possibly can he, he having been, for several years past, master of steamers and propellers on the route be tween Grand Haven , Muskegon and Chi cago; but on this occasion the weather was what the sailors call “ thick,” render ing every object indistinct, and the differ ence in the position of the two lights, Grand Haven and Muskegon, is so trifling that any man under the circunistances might have made fl e satire mistake True, the light at Grand 11 yen is a fl i-h, while* the other is a stationary or fixed one; but the flashing of the Grand Haven light is very uncertain and doubtful, which has been a cause of serious complaint on the part of masters for some time past. Capt. Evans, of the steamer Comet, says lie watched that light for over one hour, one night last week, and during that time it never flashed once. Capt. Morgan was deceived by the im aginary flash canted by the passing vessel, but was more particularly guided by the range lights, as Grand Haven is the only place that keeps range lights burning, and feeling entirely confident in the matter, headed his boat for the channel. If he had had any doubt, he would have hauled oft into the lake until daylight, notwith standing that the weather looked bad, and had every appearance of a gale. When he. discovered his error, he was too close to haul off. She struck, and the sea run ning very heavy at the time, soon drove her well up on to the beach, where she now lies, broken in two, and a complete wreck. The owner, Capt. A. E Goodrich, of this city, was on hoard, an 1 entirely ex honcrates Caplaiu Morgan from blame in the matter. The Wabash Valiev was insured f>r —oonnllv divided between the Home, Commonwealth and Northwestern Insurance Co’s. She was an A 2 propel ler, valued at §28,000. During the past season she has been running in the Green Bay trade, for which she was purchased by Capt. Goodrich. We understand he is already making arrangements for the buil ding of anew- one to supply her place, to be ready on the opening of navigation next season. How the President is Elected —The successive s f eps in the election of Presi dent and Vice President of the United States, to be taken after the November election, are as follows : Ist.

A Goon Time. —The “ local editors ” of the Milwaukee papers had a “general good time” at a Thanksgiving Dinner at the Walker House. In speaking of it, the Hews says : We have to sav that Mr. Bentlev, the gentlemanly proprietor of the Walker House, exerted himself to please his guests on the occasion, and most gloriously suc ceeded. A bettor repast was never spread, and we cannot believe one ever had better justice done it. Every delicacy of the season was provided, and the substantial w ere serve ! up in the most complete style. Long life to the Walker II- u e and proprietor, wuom .c i wc. may uh so fortunate as to Jong retain in our midst Kansas —A despatch from Washing ton to the New York W‘ rid, says that Gov. Mkdakv has just arrived from Kan sas, and says that, while people there will suffer great inconvenience from the fail ure of the crops, there is no actual want, and that the reports to the contrary are mere exaggerations. The people will he obliged to go out of the Territory to get provisions, but no suffering will ensue in consequence. Missing Steamers. —Five steamers are I supposed to have been lost on their way from England to Russia. They are the Edinburg (iron) 800 tons ; Moscow (iron) 600 ; Viscount Lambton ; Thor and Arc tic. They were all heavily laden, the !o>a ot lil on the five must have been very great. By the loss of the Edinburg, it is believed that twenty four widows and near, ly sixty children were bereave 1. The loss of property on the whole of the vessels is supposed to be ever * 1,000.000. The Montgomery Raid. The following appears in the St, Louis Republican, under the above caption and will be read with inteiest hy those who hare been contributing tnonev, clothing and provisiot s for the relief,as they suppos ed, of a starving people ; It is from the pen of a correspondent of that paper: We have some reason to believe that the present attack of Montgomery upon our homier, is something more than the raid of a robber, and is the result of a long meditated and well devise i scheme of Abol ition fanaticism. In other words, it is a second edition of the John Brown outrage. The Abolitionists of New England are at the bottom of it,and Montgomery is their only instrument as was John Brown.— r months the conspiracy has been hatch ing, and aid for the starving (and not bleeding) Kansas lias been collecting. To what extent the conspiracy may ex tend, and how much aid Las been collect ed, we can only conjecture. But we shall not be surprised if it be found that prepara tions for assaults upon the Southern States are much more extensive than now appear. At all events, it is proper that the people of all the Southern Stales should be pre pared to defend their lire Ties, their lives and property. There can be no doubt that the election of Lincoln has given an extraordinary im petus to Northern fanaticism, and that the irrepressible conflict will be waged upon the rights of the South with xnore relent less fury. Nor are we left to conjecture the fact that the Northern Abolitionists have, fur a long time, been meditating an attack upon the South. In a communication to the St. Joseph Gazette , which appears in that paper on the 2lst, and before the news of Montgomery’s outbreak could have reach ed that siction of the State, we lind the following facts stated : There can come such a time that money will be a curse, and he who has the most must forfeit Ids life, that his carcass may be robbed. There can come a time whin the greater the beauty and elegance of home, the quicker it will be marked for lustful rapine, and the sooner it will invite the desecrating tire brand of a ruthless sol diery. Have you heard the sullen roar of a cannon for the last two weeks, muttering ominous thunder from the opposite bluffs 1 Hour after hour, quicker and quicker, as practice sharpens the fingers of prepara tions? Have you noted that throughout tlm whole North, fund**, goods, supplies, provisions—in short all the equipments and munitions of war, tiro sent to the perwinr rare of a man who is clamoring under the guise of charily, for such things as would furnish an army in our western border, with the means of our destruction. If pro visions for the destitute, vvhv purchase in Bo ton ,instead of Illinois, or the bountiful west ? The infamous Tha kleus Ihatt, his til associate Marcus J. Parrott, and a desig nated confederate, S.C. Pomeroy, being the managers of the concern, the latter to have all tilings sent to his care (1) and marked “ Kansas Relief Goods." What kind of relief? We know there is no starvation in Kaitsas. Governor Medury, of that Territory soys there is none to his know ledge. We knoio there is plenty there to maintain the population and have a sur plus. Gentlemen, it is a plan to overthrow us. We recollect Thaddeus Hvatt. He of the John Brown massacre. We know the rest of the gang. They will now send the munitions of war, and next an army of blaek republican butchers, to be maintain ed by the Notih, under the pretence of charity to those who can’t use it. They are sharpening the implements of death with in our hearing. What means ;!l this need loss charity ? Ihe exact designation of a leading black republican as the sole reci piont, and a controller, distributor and in spector of the “ Kansas Belief Goods? It. means havoc, and war. and bloodshed, and forcible coercion. It bas been inaugarat ed at the North, confined to the North . controlled by the pliant and outlawed minions of ike North, and is only a groat enterprise of the North, in time of peace, to put the North ip a state of perfect pro paration for war. As to men, she has a surplus, and can he thinned out of many for the advantage of the rest. This is not idle alarm. Gentlemen, Thaddeus Hyatt would have nothing to do with this unless there was i poison in it! What do we want? We must prepare to prevent the sack and pil lage of our homes, the plunder of our banks, and the burning of our bouses We must organize a company of men to put the (own in a state of defense ; we must enforce our laws against free negroes who have become a stink in our nostrils, templing our slaves, inciting insubordina tion and infesting the very air they breathe. We must get sober, moderate, money making rjien to open their eves. Money is a good thing; so is fire in its proper place. Wo have already submitted to greater wrongs than the colonies were subjected to by Great Britain, and vet we are crying peace, peace, when there is no peace”—Union, Union, when there is no Union ! W e now see how completely facts have jnWfied the apprehensions of that writer, and though Montgomery and his gang of armed and trained Abolitionists have not let ventured to attack St. Joseph, vet we cannot tell how long it will be before they will be emboldened to do so. It is proba ble that most of the money that has been collected for the snff,rers (?) in Kansas, has been expended in lead and powder, in Sharp’s Rifles and Colt's Revolvers. The promptness with which our State Executive, as well as the authorities at V. aMiington have a'-ted, is a guarantee that Mnn f gomerv and lis outlaws will speedily be brought ■ justice or d : sper< l This i but one of the innumerable frr * s of the Abolition crusade which L oln v ii repres-ible conflict has brought upon us.

The President is in receipt of numerous letters from various leading men in the Cotton States, saying that secession is no longer a speculation, but an ab-olute cer tainty, and urging him to offer no resis tance to peaceable separation, as it would do him no good, but involve bis Adminis tration in digrace. They promise to let him close up bis term without unnecessary trouble, provided he does not interfere.— Only one letter out. of a large number has breathed Union sentiments, and the writer begged that some steps might be taken at once to arrest the tendency of things. Private advices of a reliable character from Texas state that the Lone Star flag will be again raised there, and that Texas will organize a government for herself One Union having failed, she will not risk at'aching herseif to the second. Her rep resentatives now here rather favor the idea, should dissolution take place. Senator Latham having arrived, the Pa cificrepresentatives are to hold a meeting with a view to issuing a joint adur s to their constituents, urging a separate Con federacy-, including California, Oregon, Washington, Utah tnd New Mexico. The action of the Mississippi .-euators and Representatives was not altogether un expected here, as letters from Senator Davis to President Buchanan, had devel oped the whole plan of proceedings in ad vance. it is believed that the Representa tives of several other States will follow suit after arriving here, during the present week. The resignation of the South Carolina Senators is much regretted by Mr. Buchan an, as it jeopardizes some schemes on fi-ol which may be further alluded to in a few days, and which are designed (o affect the future operations of the government,should it continue. A gentleman of distinction from Florida who arrived here ilds afternoon, savs that the kidnapping of free negro sailors by parties in that State has aroused great in dignation among her citizens. Strenuous efforts are being made to trace the negroes and bring the guilty parties to punish ment. ’’very oho here is now looking with deep interest to Northern mat fe-taMotis, ;.nd a tepea of all ol noxious legislation i eagerly anticipated, lids is regarded as the first step necessary to arrest the threat ened revolution and disruption. Kansas News. Warsaw, Dec. 1. A special message which arrived here to-night, brings the following important items from the west. It is from a teliable source and can he relied upon, Clinton, Henry Cos , Dec. Ist. That the public mind may not be mis informed or misled by the many emissa ries the abolitionists are running to and fro through the country cast of this place, as we are informed, and ti justify those who have acted promptly to prevent the accomplishment of the deep designs of the abolition marauders tinder the notorious Montgomery in Kansas and on the border we state the following facts in addition to those heretofore given. The abolitionists have continued their murderous operations in Bourbon and Hern counties, Kansas, hunting down and j driving from the territory, all men who ; have disapproved of their robbing, mur ' dering, Arc., and who have in any manner acted tos,t>!aiu the laws. The toads lead ing eastward from the territory have been crowded with wagons and persons, male and female, escaping from these fiends. In one district a mother gave birth to an infant on the road, near Hoppinville, j in this State, during the flight after the ’ family. On Monday night of lids week, a Mr. Bishop, who lives about twelve miles north of Fort i’ott, having been disturbed by a noise in the night, upon going to the door, was instantly shot down and killed, his body being pierced by several balls. We have seen here five large wagons loaded with goods, furniture, . passing through, not only from the Tenitorv but from West Point, in this State, and other places on the western line. Families living on and near (ho old Jackson place, in the western portion of the State, have been notified to leave ~• homes by’ the outlaws, and having no means of defense, have fled to Butler and other places in the interior for security, leaving their homos and effects behind. Yesterday, some slaves owned by per sons living nea- tbe line, were sent here for safe keeping. Thus have the citizens of Bates and \ ernon counties, since the commence ment of the insurrection, been threatened with destruction of life and property with out adequate means of defence or protec tion. Up to this time this state of tilings has continued, (’apt. Doaks, of Butler, has arrived here on his way for aid, arms and ammunition, from whom we have learned some of the above particulars. Later—Capt.

From Bell' t Life in London. Misconduct of Tom Sayers--- He Holds on to the Belt. The Champion’s Hklt.— This trophy was to have been given to Hurston Friday to enable him to make a triumphal entry therein to Staleybridge, but owing to the misconduct of Tom Savers, to whom it was lent for a special object some weeks back, and by whom it was not returned, were unable to hand it over. Sayers ap plied to U' for the loan of the belt for one week when he was to take a benefit in the North, and we willingly 1 ent it on the Un derstanding to return it to Mr. Hancock, the jeweler, in whose custody we had plac ed it at the expiration of the week. Wc naturally expected he had kept his word ; but on Friday when application was made to Mr. Hancock, we discovered that Say ers had never been near tho place since ha obtained the belt. We think, after the numerous kindnesses be Las received at our ban-Is, such conduct as this is most unpardonable ile knew perfectly well that the light tor the championship had taken place, and the belt would be requir ed ; and yet be took no steps whatever to return it, nor did he even let us know his whereabouts so that we might communi cate with him. It strikes us that prosper ity has raised this man so much above himself that 1 • is utterly selfish, and thinks of nothing beyond his own ends. We must request that he instantly take steps to farward the belt either to ourselves or to Sam Hurst. Mr. Hayde’s White House, Staley bridge, paying all expenses of car- I riage, etc. \\ e have learned a lesson bv | bun’s conduct on this occasion which we ! shall not easily forget. Coming Round. —All the leading; Re publican papers are now coining round to the Douglas doctrine of “ popular sover eignty’ in the territories. This is the “sober second thought” which always corrects the errors of impulse. Upon this subject the Cincinnati Commercial, a lend ing Republican paper, says; “Congres sional legislation for the protection or pro hibision ot slavery in die territories is hardly among the possibilities of the future. Ihe idea <>t protecting slave property in the territories by act of Congress, is an absurd abstraction. The idea of prohibit ing slavery in the territories by act of Congress is absolute. The people of the territories will determine the question of slavery for themselves, and Congress will admit new States without reference to slavery. In a few months these proposi •hois wol be til iost universally recognized as fixed facts.” Thus it has ever been in the history of the country. Every measure of the Dem ocratic policy has been denounced bv the opposition at firs', and adopted bv it after wards; while the same opposition has nev er carried out a measure, when in power, which is advocated out of power. The reason of this is, that the government can only be administered by Democratic prin ciples.—Milwaukee Prets, Ax Incident of Life in the Goto Re gions.—Among the deep defiles of the Rocky Mountains, lately', a small company of men stood around the new-made grave of a dead companion. With heads un covered they listened attentively to the words of (he preacher as ho offered up a prayer. \\ Idle in the midst of it one of the company discovered “the color” in tin earth at his feet thrown up fur to make room for the rema ns of the deceased. In. a loud whisper he communicated the rath er exciting intelligence to his companion. All heard it, even the clergyman, who, suspending Ids prayer, opened his eves to see his auditoiy scatter in every direction, to st ike off gold claims. Calling in a loud voice to them to stake him off’a “ claim, ,r he reclosed his eyes, hastily' concluded his prayer, and started off on a run to join his fellow* in securing a claim. Sound.— A letter signed by James Red path and several others, calling themselves a “ number of young men unconnected with any organization but desirous of de voting themselves to the work of eradica ting Slavery,” invited Gov. Packer, of Pennsylvania, to attend a meeting at Tre mont Temple, Boston, to which he re turned the fallowing reply ; llarri.sbnrgb, Penn., Nov. 21, 

ISGO. Sir; —In my opinion, the young men whose names are attached to the foregoing letter, would better servo God and their country by attending to their own busi ness.
