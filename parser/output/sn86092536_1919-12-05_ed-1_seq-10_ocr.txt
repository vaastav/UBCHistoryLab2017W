LANSING ADMITS (Continued rrom Pao On*.) jittitud- against invasion of American rights in tin- southern republic. Mr. Imnsing was quoted as saiying. was reached some months ago and row was about to develop whether the Carranza regime would accept or disregard it. He was saul to :iave added?that the admin istration was prepared to go whatever length was necessary to enforce that policy*. Hltrhcock'* Suggestion Neither the secretary nor the admin istration senators, however, were rep resented as expressing directly any op position to the Kail resolution. Several attempts to postpone, :o tion on it came from the Jv-inocratie side .and Senator Hitchcock, acting Democratic leader of the senate, suggested a substitute by which the senate no rt ly would endorse the state department's course in the matter and <lei hire in advance its sup . port of the prt sid< tit. should he decide t ? break off diplomatic relations. During the day Henry I\ Fletcher, American ambassador to Mexico, also ?vent la tore the committee and was sail to have cover-d many of the same points as did the secretary in reply to questions about the attitude of the state department. Dor some weeks he has been stationed here and has assisted in the diplomatic correspondence now in progress regrading the case of William O. Jenkins, the American consular agent under arrest at l'uebla. Await Caxranza Beply A reply now is awmited from Car ran *a to the latest American note re questing m sharp terms that Jenkins be released, and advices reaching lu re today indicated that a commission might be asked for by the Mexican president to settle the dispute. It was ^^-spid. Mr. Lansing did not indicate what course this government might take should the reply prove unsatisfactory, but was Very emphatic in hit? declar ation that the I'nit'd States was ready to shoulder any consequences which might result from its demands for pro tection of American rights. Lansing'_? Disclosures. Virtually all of Ambassador Fletch er's statement to the committee related to the Jenkins case, tut Secretary Lan sing was drawn into a detailed dis cussion of the whole general subject of relations with Mexico and told the in side story of the American govern ment's attitude during recent years. The great obstacle to a break with Mexico before the I'nited States enter ed the Kuropean war. Mr. Lansing is understood to have said, was the fact i j that such a break might have had con j sequences which would have destroyed the president's hope of avoiding1 en tanglement in the conflict overseas. J Fear of that result, lie was quoted as saying, was based on the large number of European interests in Mexico ami the suspected sympathy between Oar ranza und the German government. With the declaration of war with Germany, it was said, the situation be ?ame even more embarrassing because t was a part of Germany's war game to ?itir up trouble for the L'nited States on .his continent. .Mr. lgtnsing was said o have added that in these premises he administration felt is should go a long way in conserving its resources for the struggle with its European enemy. Endorsed By Wilson. After peace negotiations had been ?ohcluded. however, it was pointed out .1 note was sent to Carranza declaring pointedly that unless more regard were given American rights there would be a radical change in the course of the l'nited States government. This step, Mr. Lansing is said to have declared, was decided on with great deliberation and constituted a definite policy from which there had been no deviation. The secretary is understood to have added that in the circumstances he saw no real urgency for demanding the president's attention to the Jenkins case, since in dealing with it the department only had been pursuing the course -Mr. Wilson had en dorsed. Opposed to Break. In questioning the advisability of the action suggested in the Fall resolution, Mr. Lansing was quoted as saying that the Jenkins correspondence seemed j about to bring a real test whether Car J ranza meant to heed the warning giver .some months ago. and that it might be ' \v:s.-r to let this question be ??<?wercd j before breaking off relations. Such a I break, he is said also to have suggested, ? : might not only endanger the effort tc ?jobtain Jenkins' release, but also place other American lives and interests ir ' jeopardy by the withdrawal of diplo j rnatic representatives. ; ' In addition, doubt was said *n have , been raised as to what ical advan tage might tie gained by such a with drawal. Committee Named. Both the secretary and Amnassadot Fletcher went before the committee al i its request and gave their statements 1 behind closed doors. Mr. Lansing was ' at the committ'-e table more than ar 1 hour and a half, and afterward th? , members resumed consideration of thf resolution, with the democrats asking for delay. At first they proposed in dcfln.re postponement, and th--n ' p--m m? nf until the next regular meet- j nig to ho IhM Wednesday. Itutn mo- ? lions wore voted down l.y the lb-publi cans. The motion t- appoint a committee of 'Wo to endi-iior to so.. tho pr.-sid-n! was then ttutde l.y Stnator Kail.

I Tonight Senators Kill and Hitchcock had net consulted White House of ficials. and the Republican leaders said that if n conference were denied con gress would go ahead on Its own infer- j tnutlon and probably would tin- | Kali measure. The committee adjourn- | od until Monday, however, so as to give j ample time for the call on the president, j I Senator Kail, who headed a conimit | tee Investigating the entire Mexican ; situation, plans to la ysome of the re-. , suits of his inquiry before the presi dent if art lilt- rv ? -w is granted.

Tpnniii. r.onil I las. had attempted to spread Uolshevls I tic propaganda in this country drew a denial tonight from the ambassador, who Issued a formal statement tha,t he had done nothing to encourage disturb ing elements In the United States or Mexico. The notion of the committee 1y decid ing to sord representatives to see the president brought to a focus much ! elo.ul^ room speculation as to the extent : to which Mr. Wilsons Illness has han dleapped him In the discharge of his I ofTicinl duties. Committee members! j said they did not regard their action j as in any way raising formally any ' nuestlrm as to his constitutional dis- { i ability, but It was declared privately on ] I all sides that the move might result In | I clarifying the atmosphere as to his i condition.

HEROIC BATTLE (Oontlnned From Page On*.) upon the President. Mrs. Wilson has 1 chosen the course of stoical silence. | Why doesn't someone say what is the jinstter with the President? Some of the most noted physicians in i the country have issued statements. In ! timate details have from time to time .been revealed oven to the extent of de scribing troubles with the prostrato elands and digestive weaknesses. Dr. Dercum the noted neurologis has Issued ? a statement saying tint President was so much improved that he didn't be lieve ho would have to com.- hack to the White House for regular visits tiny more. Other statements of reassurance ? have been given. Yet the outcry for j mere details, for more itif >rmalion con , ? tinucs. j At the White House, officials place th? blame for this Intensified curiosity in the country at large to the studied campaign of doubt which the political I'opponents of the President have been ousting upon his acts ever since he took sick. Instead ol' adopting a resolution J of sympathy for the President?not un .expression of that kind has been intr<> I' ducvd in the House or Senate by tho i' Republicans who tire In control?a ser i J ies of speeches have been made ?1| j tending to cast discredit upon those who i j were speaking on behalf of tne Presi ? i dent as well as the President liirnS' lf. i 1 First came a debate as to whether Mr. I Wilson's signature was his own on a I public document, the inference tiring that It was forged by some of his sub , I ordinate*.
