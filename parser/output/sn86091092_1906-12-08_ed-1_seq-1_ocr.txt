Caltoct! % VOL «. NO. 29 CALDWELL. IDAHO. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 8, 1906 WEEKLY, $2.00 PER YEAR FEDERATION CASE DECIDED BY T HE SUPR EME COURT MOYER AND HAYWOOD MUST STAND TRIAL-EXTRADITION METHODS LEGAL IN EVERY PARTICULAR- MEN WERE NOT KIDNAPPED. The supreme court of the United States Monday decided the habeas corpus case of Haywood, Moyer and Pettlbone, representatives of the Western Federation of Miners, who are now held in prison in Idaho on the charge of complicity In the mur der of former Governor Steunen berg, adversely to the men. The opinion, is by Justice Harlan. The effect of the decision will be to con tinue to hold the men for trial in Idaho. Öf' tïè men Involved, Charles H. Moyer is president; VV. D. Haywood, secretàry-treàsurer, and George A. Pettibone, a member of the Western Federation of Miners. They' are now in prison in Idaho, under a charge of murdering former Gover nor Steunenberg of this state, al though It was not charged that they were present, when the crime was committed. TBé càSfes came to this court on an Sßßeal from a decision of the Idaho federal court, refusing to grant wrltg of habeas corpus. The point of controversy was the meth od <by which the Idaho authorities secured jurisdiction over the mén. All of them are residents : of Colo rado, tmt it was alleged on behalf of ^MfcyferhAd his associates' that they were kidnapped in pursuance of a conspiracy to which the gov- [ ernor of Colorado and the Idaho i authorities were parties and hence I thatf jurisdiction was acquired by I fraud. • - Justlde Harlan said that in the ha- ' beas corpus in the United States j courts, the method of extradition of I the defendants was not material. I The merits of the cases were not i Invasivem as that phase was not pre-: seated. The- unly question there in- j volved, was the right of the state ' courts to proceed with the cases of 1 which therè could be no doubt. McKenna IHiMnt*. \ Justice McKenna delivered a dis- | se arting opinion, holding that Moyer, Haywood and Pettlbone had a right to Invoke the aid of the federal courts to correct Improper methods usqtf,,J» securing their extradition. He, said that kidnapping under the law is no>more to be justified than perfortofed outside the law, wh?re every effort of authority 1* useirto"prevent and punish it. Ajinoupclng his conclusion that th#-^S«lfed"States circuit court had jufiiptftictipn jn the habeas corpus pr&eraln&s, Justice Harlan said: Act« in Colorado Legal. "Looking first at what was al leged to, have occurred In Colorado, touching ïhé arrest of the petitioner and his deportation from that state, we do not perceive that anything done there, however hastily or ln conWdefately done, can be adjudged to 'he3 In violation of the oonstUu-. tlon or laws of the United States. He added that the governor of that state had not been under com pulsion -tq demand proof beyond that contained In the .extradition pa pers. His failure to require inde pendent proof of the fact that pe titioner, was as alleged, a' fugitive from justice, cannot be regarded as an Infringement of any right of the petitioner under the constitu tion or laws of the United States. "^'No' Rights Violated. He also said that even if there wop fraud In the methods of remov al PtMt*» had been no violation of rights under the constitution. "II It Is true," he added, "as con tended by the petitioner that If he was not a fugitive from justice wlth liL^tk« i*eanlng of the constitution, nd "wtfTa'ht for his arrest Could have been legally Issued by the governor of Colorado. It is equally true that even after the issuing of such a warrant before his deportation from Colorado, It was competent, for a court, federal or state, Sitting in that state, to inquire whether he was'fil Yact a fugitive, and If found nd£ to be to discharge him from the custody of the Idaho agent and pre vqb L his deportation from Colorado. Rights of Officers. t "NQ obligation was imposed by th# constitution or laws of the Unit ed" Stat»* upon the agent of Idaho aa'to time the arrest of the petition er and so conduct his deportation from Colorado as to afford him a convenient oportunity before some judicial tribunal sitting in Colora do. to test the question whether he was a fugitive from justice and as such liable under the act of con gress, to be conveyed to Idaho for trial there. Jurisdiction of Lower Courts. "It cannot be contended that the circuit court sitting in Idaho could rightfully discharge the petitioner upon allegation and proof simply that he did not commit the crime of murder charged against him. His guilt or innocence of that charge is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Idaho state court. The ques tion in the court below was not whether the accused was guilty or innocent, but whether the Idaho court could properly be prevented from proceeding in the trial pf that issue upon proof being made in the circuit court of the United States sitting in that state, that the pe titioner was not a fugitive from jus tice and not liable, in virtue of the constitution and law» of the United States, to arrest In Colorado under the warrant of Its governor and car ried into Idaho." After reviewing antecedent decis ions he announced that the princi ples set fort. In them 'require an af firmance of the judgment of the cir cuit court." May Not Impugn Motives. "Any Investigation as to the mo tives which Induced action by the governors of Idaho and Colorado would be improper «s well as irrele vant to the real question to be now determined. It must be conclusive ly presumed that those officers pro ceeded throughout this affair with no evil purpose and with no other motive than to enforce the law." 

AUSTRIAN® FIGHT. They Have Trouble With ' Their 111 -, terpreter, Whom Thejr "Beat Up" 1<tr Demanding Five Per Month From Kach—They Have Been Very Unruly of I .ate—Light-fin gered, Too. As the result of trouble with their .Interpreter, 32 Austrlans In the em ploy of Contractors Faris & Kesl on the grading work on the Boise & In terurban line, were discharged at camp^ No. 1, five miles from Boise, Thursday. The interpreter made a demand for }5 a month, from each and a flght resulted In which the interpreter was badly beaten up by his countrymen. The Austrlans had been employed at the camp the last 26 days. For the iijut 10 days they have been very quarrelsome, not only among themselves, but with others. There have been a number of thefts of clothing and other things In the camp of late for which It Is thought the Austrlans were responsible. It became necessary to have armed guards at the camp during the day fer protection from theft, and other (nen employed there had threatened to quit If the Austrlans were not discharged. It Is thought that, the discharge of the men will Interfere In no way with the prosecution of work on the line, as it Is expected a new force will be secured at once. C. L. 8. C. Program for Dec. IS.

Defective Material Used Causes Con siderable Loss.—Statements By CiiiitriU'lnrs h (id Architect.—No Blame Attached to A ay One In Particular.—Fortunate Nobody Was Injured. The two piers at the south end of the R. C. Layering building on Kimball street fell down Wednes day afternoon, causing considerable damage. Fortunately no one was in the way, or on that part of the build ing at the time. The heavy irons also fell. The cause of the accident was defective brick material. A rep resentative of The Tribune asked Mr. T. H. Sou le, what In his opin ion, was the cause of the accident. Mr. Soule stated that after a thor ough Investigation by himself and the contractors, the conclusion was reached that, in the iirst course of brick work, defective bricks were used. These bricks crumbled Into dust when the weight resting upon the wall became too great. No blame can be attached to anyone. In particular. Mr. Soule used every possible precaution against using bad material, and Contractor P. H McDonald was also very careful. It was simply one of those -things that happen in spite of everything that can be done. - While it was a bad accident, It happened at a fortunate time. Other contractors in the city completely exonerate Contractor Mc Donald and Architect Soule from any blame. Mrs. Isabelle Agnes Houle. - Mrs. Isabelle Agnes Soule, whose death occurred at. Boise two weeks ago, was born at Brooklyn, New York, July 20, 1870. Her family moved to California, while she was a child. September 20, 1901, she was married to Architect T. II. Soule.

SOUTH MOUNTAIN DISTRICT COMING RIGHT TO THE FRONT I HE MINES IN THAT SECTION ARE SHOWING UP-FINE COPPER PROJECTS IN SIGHT- WILL BE A GREAT CAMP IN THE NEAR FUTURE. The South Mountain section Is of unusual interest to the people of Caldwell, because when that section Is thoroughly developed, a large trade will naturally come to this city. Steps have been taken on previous occasions, looking to the shipment of ore front South Moun tain to Caldwell. That our business men may keep themselves well In formed as to the activities at South Mountain, we clip from the Owyhee Nugget the following account of the South Mountain district. A crew of miners, a cook and several loads of supplies have been taken to South Mountain, and an active campaign -of development work begun, to be continued during the winter, upon the Sonucmann group of patented claims. This group comprises nearly all the mines which were conspicuous producers more than twenty-five years ago. when a smelter was run there, and the- camp contained nearly one thousand people. The mines, near the surface, were rich in lead and sliver, but when water level was reached In any of them, where the ores were not oxydlzed. they changed to black jack or zinc, In those days a bar tp their being worked for silver-lead contents and the boomlng-camp fell down. The smelter went out of commission, with a quantity of co&e still on hand, which had been brought from Scotland by vessel, shipped up the Columbia river and hauled to South Mountain from Umatilla by wagon, a distance of four hundred miles. Almost every structure in the once booming camp. In a few years disap peared. The buildings, and hund reds of cords of wood and thousands of bushels of charcoal, burned foi the smelter, were hauled away, or rotted. The lumber went to build houses In the valleys. Even the bul lion molds from the smeller can. many of them, be found doing duty as chicken troughs, on ranches. The site of the charmingly located cam) became grazing ground for sheep and cattle. But a few men held on to or re located nearly all that were then considered valuable claims and kept them represented, until about a doz en years ago, a man from Northerr Idaho came on the ground and or ganized a new company, paying the men who owned the claims In stock in his company and then made » fluke of the whole thing, even fail ing to keep the claims represented, and the greater number of them were forfeited to the government, only a few of the former owners still holding 011. Then Sonnemann and Brans combe, two Spokane mining tuen who -were handling the Cumberland mine, on War Eagle, (and made quite a fortune out of that venture) got over to South Mountain, relo cated or otherwise aqulred titles tc most of the properties In the group, did a large amount of development work, proving the great value ol the properties, and secured patents on-'thfem eight years ago. Mr. llran8combc dropped out soon after ward. and Mr. Sonnemann continues to control the group. He has had numbers of offers for the property, all which have been declined, he simply contenting himself by pay ing a caretaker, George Rasner, to look after them and do a little fur ther development, work up to the present time. But this last summer, state mint inspector Robert N. Bell, went to South Mountaiu to Inspect thf Standard Mining company's lead carbonate and coper properties, mot-« recently located, on the eastern sidt of the mountain, and while there hi examined the Sonnemann group. When he. went away he told his friend, Wayne Darlington, formet State Engineer, and later superin tendent of Mackay mines, thai "those fellows over at South Moun tain don't know what they hav» got." and Mr. Darlington went straightway and secured an option for the Sonnemann properties, se cured the capital to develop them, hence the work being started, to be kept up until spring, when we will be certain to hear big reports from these mines. The editor of the Nugget has al ways had confidence In their ulti mate outcome of South Mountain, since 18 years ago, he spent three days in that then abandoned camp in company with Mr. John Des Loge of Mlsouri, then an expert for the Granite Mountain company of Mon tana, wlio made at that time the sur» prising prediction that the mines would some day turn out to be a great copper producers, though at 1 he time the existence of copper iq those days was not even suspected. Since then It has been demonstrated that very rich copper ore exists at depth.
