PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE This document impresses the reader moat ^ favorably by' the exceeding clearness and sue- ; tinctness with which the operations of Gov- ; ernment fcr the year are setfortb, and its future policy developed. j So compactly are the leading facts stated. J indeed, that no resume could well be made cotdent-icp them wthont making Important omissiors. To those who expected that Mr. Lincoln ? wculd ur-fcld some patent plan for attaining peace sfcert cf crushing the military power of j the Confederacy, the message will prove a dis- ; appointment. Hut the lopic of President Lincoln upon thi3 j point is so irresistible that those who expected the President to somehow enunciate or declare j ? a peace" mnst see that the disappointment is Of their own making. It it, as Mr. Lincoln so tor clr.sivelv shows, an issue whi*h can only be ined by war ard decided by victory." At the same time he reitera'es that the southern people can at any moment have peace, simply j by laying down their arms and submitting to j to the rational authority under the Constita- ; tier.

I The exposition of facts showing that we are ; uot exhausted, nor in progress of exhanstion? . either in men or physical resources, by the war,Is interesting and satisfactory, and can- ; not but have a good effect in disabusing the | minds of those wno have imagined that this t great nation was already at the end of its re- 1 sources by reason of a war whicb, however ( colossal in character, bas !>een so brief in com- f parieon with the protracted struggles of other nations in fighting for their birthrights. The message, though unpretending and busi ness-like in character, will take rank as among our best State papers.

Richmond papers of Monday, 5th inst., are in town, but contain no news or importance. They either know nothing or will say nothing of the movements of Sherman later than al ready received by us from Savannah paoers. They assume editorially, however, that Sher man has not yet reached Mlllen, Ga., and con sequently wo have no confirmation of the re port that our cavalry were within six miles of Savannah. It is encouraging rews for us, however, that the rebels have no successes to boast over: and consequently we may be sure that Sherman is progressing satisfactorily in the prosecution ol his plan ol campaign, wherever that may lead him.

The Senate Naval Committee.?The oc casion of tae Republican party Senatorial cau cus held to-day is understood to have been the absolute necessity, in the current exigen cies of public afTairs, ol harmonizing the chair manship of their naval affairs committee with the Navy Department, the constant disagree ments between that l>epartment and the late chairman having as plainly as grievously injured tho public interests. No decision was arrived at to-day ia the caucus, but it Is said to have been evident that the Senators pxeseu* evinced the fixed purpose of putting a stop to the injuricns state of things in this connection that existed throughout the last session.

Senate.?Mr. Eane, of ludiana, iatrodaced a bill authorizing the holding of a special ses. ston of the United States District Court of It diana and for o'her purposes The time named for the special term is the third Tues clay in December, 1?64, and the Judge is au thorized to order a special term at any time hereafter when necessary. Mr. Morrill introduced a bill to amend the act incorporating the Metropolitan Railroad Company of this city. The bill amends section 17 of that act so as to extend the time for the completion of the saiii railroad to two years from and after the passage of this act It also repeals all acta and parts of acts inconsistent with this act. The bill was read a first and second time and laid on the table. The President pro ten presented a commu nication from Michael Hahn, Governor of Louisiara, transmitting the proceedings of the General Assembly of Louisiana. Korea.?Mr. Blaine, of Maine, moved to re consider the vote by which, yes erday, the bills introduced by Mr. Stsv?*ns, of Pa., were re ferred to the Committee of Ways and Means? namely : to prohibit tbe exportation of gold and silver coin, and to prevent gold and silver coiu and bullion from being paid or acc*pt*d for a greater value than their r-al current value, and for preventing any vote or bill is sued by the United States from being reoelved for a smaller snm than is therein specified. Mr. Blaine said that these bills had already produced much mischief, yesterday largely potting up the price of gold. Mr. Cox thonght that the President hacW played tbe bull in (be message. Mr. Stevens defended tbe policy which he proposed In these bills, saying the anhjec* had occupied tbe attention of the wisest statesmen of Europe for centuries. Mr. Stevens moved to lay Mr. Blaine's mo tion on the table, but this was disagreed to? yeas 51, nays 60. The voto by which the bill was referred to the Committee of Ways and Means was recon sidered. Mr. Stevens moved to postpone it for teii javs. Mr. Blaine moved that it be lai4 upon the table. This was agreed to?yeas 73, nays 55. Kfport of Secretary Ukher?District Mat ters. We hare received a copy of ihe interesting acd able report of Secretary Usher, of the In. terior Department, but are able to day to give space only to some extracts In relation to Dis trict matters. Secretary Usher says : "The report of the Commissioner or Public Buildings presents many details of interest to the citizens and resident's ot this District, and contains information in respect to the manner In which various appropriations for local pur poses have been applied The condition of the streets and avenues of Washington city Is a matter of frequent and just complaint. The United States has never assumed any gener.il jurisdiction of the subject, although appropri ates for improving the avenues have been lreqnently made. ?The city authorities, apparently relying upon the liberality ot Congress, have ab stained Irom making expenditures in improv ing and opening streets commensurate with the constant increase of population and busi ness. 1 his state of affairs i3 likelv to ccntinne until a definite arrangement is established be tween the government and the city in relation to the matter under consideration. I therefore renew the recommendation made last year, that street commissioners should be appointed J to determine the description and extent of the j annual repairs and improvements to avenues, j sticets and alleys; and that the funds requisite should be provided by the United States and the city in proportions to be tlxed bv law. The propei ty-holders of Washington, moved bv a just pude in the prosperity and beauty of the city, w ill not hesitate to tax themselves lib?r eraily to maintain a constant and efficient sys tem of street improvement. The present rate of municipal taxation, for all purposes, is a out one per centum on real and personal property, w hich is less than is paid in any other city with which lam acquainted. The tax-payers here are not charged with the ex pense of maintaining a State government, or those institutions of a benevolent character which are usually sustained bv other commu nities, and they will not shrink from taxation for local purposes, when their property is yielding a rate of income equalled in lew other cities and towns of the country. The propriety of these remarks is still more apparent, when It is considered that the ex penses of the judicial tribunals for both civil and criminal business, and of the police force, are principally paid by the Government, and are not charged to the property-holders of the City or District. Keoognizlng, however, the duty of the Government to make provision for t! e improvement and repair of streets extend ing through public grounds, and to aid in keep ing in a suitable condition, such as are in front ol the public buildings, I would respectlully recommend that provision be made by Con gress lor paving F street, between Tth and !>th streets. The Nicholson pavement, by reason of its durability, smoothness, *<nd elasticity, has met with marked favor. In view ot the prob::bility that measures will be adopted by Congress providing some plan for suitably pav g Penney 1\ania avenue. and other pnu cip: thoroughfares ol the city, I have obtained an e .mateof the expenseof laving the Nichol son ;r>vement in F street, along 'he southern front f the building occupied by this Depart im nt "I?i .int resolution No. 50, of June, 18GI, the St tret ;y of the Interior was, among other tliia-e- lirected to prevent the improper ap pioj tion or occupation ot any of the public t-'re. ?? iVc., in the city of Washington. One ox tin rejects of this resolntion evidently was to p:t i. ntthe re-buildingof the Centre Market L'ou.-e > on its present site. Notice was accor ding! i vea to the authorities of the city to de sist .. the erection of the building that had jut! bi-. commerced, and they thereupon sus I lie work upon it. The authorities m i i t a commendable disposition to make t! ii i ssaiy improvement in such place and mani: i will meet the approbation of Con grets " si'bs'an.lal and rapid progress of the cit\ !. r th ? last threi- years, its increasing and er.crgetu- population, and the certainty of its i:itme ?, pperity, evince the importance of ?uiinediii .iction, having for its object the Im prove "fi. of its sewerage, the cleansing of the cans, i-so us to correct, as far as possible, its presi i t v.nv. holesome and offe isive condition? nmi<: aoomment of the s reets and public grou- . s, thereby making the metropolis of the natici. it althy and attractive. To that end, in addition to the suggestions contained in my last P .r.nal report, It is recommended that Cor.gr. provide by law Tor the removal of the Cen o Market-house from Its present site and the extension of the Smithsonian grounds' to Pennsylvania avenue It is also advisad that the public reservations bordering on the cantfl ai cl ad joining the Smithsonian grounds be added thereto. "The enlarged area which the proposed change would give lo these grounds, their adornment by the planting of trees and shrub bery, and the erection of fountains, would add greatly to the comfort, health, and pleasure of a populous portion of the city, and be mo. t agreeable and attractive to transient vlsitcis. The space occupied by the canal from T h street to 6th street and the contiguous rettrv^ion would afford ample roam for the market nout-e. The expense of making this space available is not worthy of consideration in view of the substantial benefits to be obi taint, t y extending the Sodihsonian ground/ to the Avenue It is believed that Congress may, without interfering wi'h any right of the citj ci Washington, make such di-position of the cii.nl as it shall deem proper; and if it shcul'l be determined to extend the sewer. now ben l < .instructed through the botanic garden, alon*: i.d m the canal to the river, and to iill up th itsidue of the canal, there can bs but little pfct that the grounds thus reclaimed for ouildir.g and other purposes will be equal in \i:>i'to the expense ot the improvement." Coi - erning the jail, the Secretary makes the folir ug important recommendation : ' I considered carelully the suggestion ol t..' warden, that ample means for he con striction of such a building, m ght be obtained by ' ?* sale ol the vacant square on wnich the jail ? ,iw sti.nds. This square, so near to the Cap.., I and Smithsonian grounds, will not he ntC ' -ary lor beautifying the city, or for af forthug it ample ventilation. According to an est. ate which has been submitted to me, it co. un9 Equarefeetof ground, which, it <d vfl in lots and sold, would at present pT 3 command a large sum. The nevfr ja.il m ,ht be located npon the square on which the Ci , Hall stat ds, in the rear of that building. II ???cted af'er the most approved modern' pi , i'would not prove detrimental to private piopeity, whilst the erection ol dwellings or to dings for business purposes, npon the s-T are, which it is proposed to sell, would tei i greatly to enhance the value of private pi t perty in the vicinity. ? The warden ot the jail, and the grand jar tl .1 served at the June term ol the court, as v "il ds the police commissioners, have called at HLtion to the large number of juvenile offen d? is In the Di-trict, and to thegreatimproprie t.\ uf incarcerating them with veterans in crime. ^ uths so treated are often discharged from thr* jail more depraved than when the.y entere< it. The recommendation made last year in favor id the erection of a house of C3:reotioii for such offenders is resppctfully renewed. It should be so regulated as to combm* punish ment with means ot instruction and retorm. Tao necessity for the erection of a penitantiarv in this District was fully set forth in the last annual report of this Department. Additional ?orce cannot be given to the recommenc!.vion tlieu made by a repetition of the views therein presented.''
