The president's message will be found on our inside pages. As it is a document that all would be benefitted by reading, we will not tempt any one to omit it by summarizing it. It will be found a very unpretending, busi ness like paper, containing a number of valuable suggestions that Congress would do well to heed, but that it probably will not. A mono the recommendations of President Arthur, was one that a pen sion ho slvpn to Gen. Grant. In ac cordance with this recommendation. the chairman of the committee on pen sions during the first dajs of the ses sion, introduced a bill allowing Gen. Grant an annual pension of $5000. "We are glad to see, by Tuesday's dallies, that the bill has been withdrawn at the General's own request, he having written to the gentlemau who intro duced it, that uuder no circumstances could he accept a pension. This act will very greatly raise Gen. Grant in the opinion of the vast majority of his countrymen. No one would begrudge him the $5000 if he needed it, but in spite of his losses last summer he is still a rich man, and can ill afford to appear before the country in the role of a beggar. By request of McCook Post No. 51, G. A. B., and under their auspices, The Daily Register will again make its appearance during the holi days. This little sheet obtained r very flattering reception last winter and with a large stock of experience accumulated since then and much bet ter mechanical facilities, we hope this winter to make it even more worthy of your kind consideration and pat ronage. The first number will be is sued on the 24th Inst., and seven num bers will be issued in all. There will bo 300 copies printed daily, making a total edition of 2,100 copies. These will be carefully and systematically distributed, not only in Iola, but also in Moran, Colony and Humboldt. This Mill make it a most valuable ad vertising medium, and as rates will be reasonable, we hope that the Daily will be well patronized. J. C. 

HUBBAT TO THE FRONT. Our old fellow townsman, J. C. Mur ray, is not without (political) honor in Missouri as he was here. He is a member elect of the legislature of that state and is prominently mentioned for high places In that body. The Platto county Argus, quoted with fa vorable comments by the Nevada Democrat nominates him for speaker of the house in the following compli mentary language: "Anions: the most distinguished democrats elected to the next house of representatives is Judge J. C. Murray, of Vernon county, a native of our town and county, and brother of Mrs. B. P. C. Wilson. A ripe scholar and a law yer of flue ability, as well as an ardent, active working democrat, he has long been one of the pillars of the party in the southwestHis name is being prom inently mentioned in connection with the speakership of the house, for which he Is so admirably qualified. Judge Murray will not meet his superior in either branch of the general assem bly." THE HUMBOLDT TRAGEDY. A most unfortunate affray took place in Humboldt last Monday night which resulted in the killing of Frank "Vogt and serious wounding of bis half broth er, Herman Scheer. As has been gen erally known there has been a warrant in the hands of the sheriff for some time for the arrest of John Brooks and Herman Scheer, charged with violat ing the prohibitory law. They have eluded the officers until last Monday when Sheriff Gordon received notice that they were in Humboldt. Ac companied by John Brown, he accord ingly went to Humboldt, Monday evening, arriving there after dark. Upon the recommendation of Mr. Amos they went to the house of Mr. Ashcraft and asked him to go with them and show them where these men lived. Ashcraft demurred but finally consented to go, They went first to the house of Johu Brooks, and finding him at home, John Brown arrested him and took him to the Nickleplate Hotel. Gordon and Ashcraft then returned to the square and Gordon, leaving Ashcraft m front of the old Monroe house, told him to remain there on the lookout, while he went to the Fitzsimmons' place to look for Scheer. What happened afterwards is thus told by Scheer himself, before the coroner's jury : I was at Humboldt on the evening of December 8th, when on affray took place between myself, Frank Voght and A. W. Ashcraft. I was in com- fiany with Frank Voght and was go ng south on 8lh street when Ashcraft tapped me on the shoulder and said I was under arrest. I said he could not arrest me, be was no officer. He tapped me on the shoulder. J think I hit him twice in the face. I think he has two blue spots in the face. Then he shot. I had hold of him. He shot twice. 1 think the first two shots did not take effect. The third shot I think he hit Frank Voght. He fired five shots. I had holdof his hand. He pulled away from me and ran up the street Frank did not hit him that I know of. I had hold of his right hand with my right hand. He did not say a word. Frank did not do anything that I know of. There were three along. Frank Voght went on ahead and then came back. He heard this fuss. Some one was with Frank. One shot was fired be fore Frank came hack. He came back walking. At the time Ashcraft first tapped me on the shoulder Frank Voght was four or five steps ahead of mo with the creamery man. The creamery niai did not come back. I had no revolver, pistol or knife. Had nothing in my hand. It was very dark, but I could see Ashcraft'a face plain enough to know him. Don't know whore he came from. He came out of stairway, it may be, but I don't know. He was facing east when fired first Bhot. There was .a window bro ken, I guess he fired through there. I'm sure one shot went through there. He nulled loose when he shot me. It was the last or last but one shot that hit me. I was shot In the rlehtshoul der from in front. I had hold of him when he shot me. Frank Voght was not armed. Didn't see any arms except what Ashcraft had. H said some thing when I told him he was not an ifRtAt. litif T Minnnf. foil TPlmf 1 f. Wflfl. I think I grabbed him immediately. I think ho nad tne revolver in nisnana. I am positive he had the revolver In his hand. He first Btepped to my right side. I think the third Bhot took effect fh Voeht. First or second shot went through the window. I did not see Frank fall. The affray took place at southeast cornerofJNlcKoleu'B omce. Voght was found only a step away from me. It was southeast corner where I was standing. Frank was three or four steps uway. I did not see him shoot at Frank, ho was trying to shoot me. Can't say that Frank did anything. Ashcraft was trying to shoot me and I was trying to keep him from it. After tapping me on the shoulder he took hold of me and null ed me out to one Bide. I grabbed the right hand. It had a revolver in it. Then he shot. I struck him in the f.ice two or three times. It was after the first shot I Btruck him. I did not strike him before he shot. I struck him with left hand. He patted my shoulder with his left hand, at the time I think I saw the revolver. In his rieht hand. I did not know when Frank came back. Several other witnesses were exam ined, eliciting no new facts. The jury desiring to hear the testimony of Gor don, who was outof the county search ing for Ashcraft, an adjournment was had until Thursday. Immediately after the affray Ash craft fled and was not heard of until Wednesday when the sheriff of Green wood county telegraphed that he had placed himself in his custody. John Brown went the same day to get him In the absence of Ashcraft'a story, and even of the verdict of a coroner's jury, it would be folly to venture an opinion as to the degree of Ashcraft's guilt. The testimony of Mr. Scheer, who is tainly interested in throwing Ash craft in as bad a light ub possible, shows that the killing of Vogt was accidental. But putting the worst possible construction upon it, the con duct of some of the citizens of Hum boldt is reprehensible in the highest degree. They seemed to go perfectly wild, and if they could have found Ashcraft that night, they would un doubtedly have hung him. They even threatened John Brown, believ ing that he was concealing him. But they look it back when Mr. Brown re minded them that he had been in Kansas too long to stand any foolish ness. A mob of 30 or 40 went to Geo. Amos' residence and insisted on searching it. They were up here twice that night to search the jail Hearing that he was expected in from Eureka Wednesday, fourteen of them came up at noon to meet him and es cort him to his preliminary trial at Humboldt, remarking that after the preliminary was over he would be no expense to the county. Such, actions and such talk cannot be condemned too strongly. If A. W. Ashcraft is guilty of willful murder, every good citizen will insist that the extreme penalty of the law be visited upon him; but whether he is thus guilty or not can only oe determined after a fair trial, and this he must have. No one can say whether ho .is guilty or not. Let the law decide, not a mob. ASHCRAFT'S 8TATEMENT : Since the above was written, John Brown has returned from Eureka, where he found Ashcraft in the custo dy of Sheriff DeFoe, with whom he has left him, as Ashcraft did not think it safe to come here. He says that Ashcraft's statement is as follows : 'I arrested Scheer and ho was about to go along without much trouble when Voght struck me aud knocked mc against the window. Scheer then fired one shot at me, when Voght struck me, knocked imo down and kicked me. As I got up I drew niy revolver and shot Voght twice and killed him. Scheer then clinched me. I shot twice at him and jerked loose, tearing my coat in doing so, and ran." TEMPERANCE LECTUBES IK HOBAH.
