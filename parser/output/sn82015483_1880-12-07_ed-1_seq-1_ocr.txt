All it eequdies on THE PART OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS A FULL VOTE AND NO SCRATCHING. . VOTE THE WHOLE TICKET. THE: PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's Message is the longest State paper erer sent- by him to Congress. It is so long that it will frighten away from its perusal many who would read a shorter document. Nevertheless, those who do wade through it will find much to compensate them for the effort. After commenting upon the continued and increasing prosperity of the country, tha peaceful and happy outcome of the presiden tial election, the improvement visible in the state of affairs in the South, and the duty of the government to maintain the constitution al rights of all the citizens of the country, the President takes up the subject of popular ed ucation, and recommends that "Congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safe guards, supplement the local educational funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been devolved upon uneducated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of public lands, and, if necessary, by appropriations from the Treasury of the United States." Civil service reform is next discussed. The President has not seen any reason to change his mind concerning this matter, and seems to be better satisfied with what has been ac complished than some others who believe in and are working for the reform, and more hopeful for its future. He recommends an appropriation of $25,000 per annum for a commission whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform and effi cient system of competitive examinations and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the government. He also recommends such legislation as shall enable every public officer to feel as safe as any private citizen in refus ing all demands upon his salary for political purposes, a complete divorce between Con gress and the Executive in the matter of ap pointments, and the repeal of the provisions of section 17G7,and of the sections following, comprising the tenure of office act of March 2, 1867. It will probably be some time be fore these recommendations receive the at tention to which they are entitled. Upon the Mormon question the President uses plain language, and urges Congress to adopt such measures as will secure the speedy abolition of the evil of polygamy and the sec tarian political power of the Mormons. He recommends that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a Governor and judges or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate a government analogous to the provisional government established for the Territory northwest of the Ohio by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to con tinue the existing form of local government, he recommends that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah, be confined to those who neither prac tice nor uphold polygamy. In that part of the Message which treats of our foreign relations there is little of special interest. The President refers to his special message in March last concerning the propos ed canal across the Isthmus of Panama, and declares that subsequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion "that it is the right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any inter-oceanic canal across the Isth mus that connects North and South America as will protect our national interest." For the further development of our for eign commerce the President would have the country follow the example of Great Britain and establish regular steam postal communi cation with the markets whose trade is sought. He would also like to see a cable laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The attention of Congress is called to what Secretary Sherman says in his annual report concerning the refunding of the national debt, the retirement of the legal tenders is recommended, and the coinage of an honest silver dollar. Other recommendations are : Legislation for organizing, arming and disciplining the active militia of the country ; attention to the report of the chief of engineers apon the condition of our national defences; improve ment of the Mississippi and its tributaries and the Columbia ; that the office of Captain General of the Army be created and General Grant placed in it ; some form of civil gov ernment for the people of Alaska ; that an in termediate appellate court be established in order to help the transaction of business in the federal courts ; an increase of the num ber of Indian schools ; the passage of the bill providing for the allotment of lands in severalty to the Indians ; and attention to the general interests of the District of Columbia. 

EDITORIAL NOTES. Vote to-day, and vote early. Hon. Dexter B. Wright has shown great ability and efficiency in all the offices he has held. He would be a first-class Mayor. Give him your vote. A correspondent of the New York Evening Pott, writing from Amelia county, Virginia, says v ''The rising generation are all abolition ists, and all express horror at thought of human slavery. I discovered this by accident, and have extended my inquiries considerably, and bo far find no exception in a person under twenty years of age." . ' The bill introduced in the South Carolina Legislature to prevent duelling is as stringent as such, a measure can be made. Not only the duelist who kills his man, but every sec ond as well, is pronounced guilty of murder, and is menaced with the death penalty. If either or both principals are wounded, but not killed, all concerned in the affair of honor are deemed guilty of misdemeanor, and can be imprisoned in the State penitentiary for a period of not less 4han twenty years, and be deprived of the privilege of holding any office in the State. If a challenge be sent or ac cepted within the State, but the duel be fought in another State, the same punishment is to be inflicted. The President's Message. Felhvy Citizen of the Senate and. Iloute of HepretentaUvet : I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our country. By the favor of divine providence we have been blessed, during the past year, with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable em ployment for all our people, and with con tentment at home, and with peace and friend ship with other nations. The occurrence of the twenty-fourth elec tion of chief magistrate has afforded another opportunity to the, people of the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmis sion of power and authority of government from the publio servants whose terms of of fice are about to expire, to their newly-chosen successors. This example cannot fail to im press profoundly thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which repub lican institutions afford. The immediate, general and cheerful acquiescence of all good citizens in the result of the election gives gratifying assurance to our country, and to its friends throughout the world, that a government based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people possesses elements of strength, stability and permanen cy not found in any other form of govern ment. - THE BIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP. Continued opposition to the full and free enjoyment of the rights of citizenship, con ferred upon the colored people by the recent amendments to the Constitution, still prevails in some of the late siaveholding States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested in the re cent election to any large extent in acts of vi olence or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudulent practices in connection with the ballots, with regulations as to the places and manner of voting, and with counting, return ing and canvassing the votes cast, been suc cessful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative of all rignts, tne ngnt or suf frage, which the Constitution expressly con fers upon our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. They pre fer that no section of the country should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse prompt and hearty obedience to the equal-rights amendments to the Constitu tion is all that now stands in the way of complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or disre garded, it is safe to assume that the people who placed them in the Constitution, embodying the legitimate results of the war for the Union, and who believe them to be wise and necessary, will continue to act'togeth er and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is, as to the enjoy ment of the right by every American citizen who has the requisite qualifications, to freely easterns vote and to have it honestly counted. With this question rightly settled, the coun try will be relieved of the contentions of the st ; bygones will indeed be bygones ; and political party issues with respect to econo my and efficiency of administration, internal improvements, the tariff, domestic taxation, education, finance, and other important sub jects, will then receive their full share of attention ; but resistance to and nullification of the results of the war will unite together in resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority of tne government and the perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our government. They are the solemn expression of the will of the people of the United states. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of all our citizens must be maintained does not erow weaker. It will continue to control the government of this country. Happily, the history ofthe late election shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the fifteenth amendment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether, if firm and well considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House of Representatives and the Senate, which have the right to judge of the elections, returns,. qualifications of their own members, will see to it that every case of violation oflthe letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty of the Executive, with sufficient appro priations for the purpose, to prosecute un sparingly all who have been engaged in de priving citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guarantee of primary rights of citizenship is to be found in that capacity for self-protection which can belong only to a people whose right to universal suffrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command of the local and State au thorities are, in many cases, wholly inade quate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where, be fore emancipation, the education of the peo ple was neglected or prevented in the inter est of slavery. I'lrnuy convmced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehen sive action by the government of the United States, I respectfully recommend that Con gress, by suitable legislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been devolved on uneducated people. by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and, if necessary, by appropria tions from tne Treasury of the United states. Whatever government can fairly do to pro mote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general education is found, peace. virtue, and social order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. In mv former annual messages. I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent necessity of a reformation of the civil-service system of the government. My views con cerning the dangers of patronage, or appoint ments for personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience in the Executive office, and I believe these dangers threaten the stability of the government. Abuses so serious in then nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of administrative service, as the growth of the country in population in creases the number of officers and placemen employed. he reasons are imperative lor the adop tion of fixed rules;for the regulation of ap pointments, promotions and removals, estab lishing a uniform method, having exclusively in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most economical and efficient administration of the public business. Competitive examinations, in aid of im partial appointments and promotions, have been conducted for some years past in sev eral of the Executive departments, and by my direction this system has been adopted in the custom house and postoffices of the lar ger cities of the country. In the city of New York over two thousand positions in the civil service have been subject, in their appoint ments and tenure of place, to the operation of published rules for this purpose, during the past two years. The results of these practi cal trials have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this ' system of selection. All are subjected to the same tests, and the result is free from preju dice by personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for the position applied for the best qualifications attainable among the com peting applicants. It is an effectual protec tion from the pressure oi importunity wmcn, under any other course pursued, largely ex acts the time and attention of appointing of ficers, to their great detriment in the dis charge of their official duties, preventing the abuse of the service for the mere furtherance at private or party purposes, and leaving the employe of tne government, ireea irom tne oblicrations imposed bv patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention and advance ment, and with this constant incentive to ex ertion and improvement. These invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the offices where the rules for appointment for competitive examination have been applied. A method whicn has so approved itself by experimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive should bs extended to all surbordinate positions un der the government. I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment demands im mediate measures for securing and enforcing the highest possible efficiency in the civil ser vice, and its protection from recognized abuses, and that the experience referred to has demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. . - -. The examinations in the custom houses and postoffices have been held under many em- barassments and without provision for com pensation for the extra labor performed by the officers. who have conducted them, and whose commendable interest in the improve ment of the public service has induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors gratu- -itously ought not to be expected, and, without an appropriation by Congress for compensa tion, it is not practicable to extend the sys tem of examinations generally throughout the civil service. It is highly important that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general supervision. Section 1753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes the President to prescribe the regulations for admission to the civil service of the United States, and for this pur pose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect to age, health, character, knowledge and ability, for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter;" but the law is practically inoperative for want of the requisite appropriation. I therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the President in accordance with the terms of this section, whose duly it shall be devise a just, uniform and efficient system of competitive examina tions, and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the Government. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford for testing the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members of Congress as it will be to the President and heads of Departments, but that it will also greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment whidh now inevitably and constantly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between the Legislative and Exe cutive Departments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of in fluence and official favoritism, in the bestow al of office, will be the substitution of an open competition of merit between the appli cants, in which every one can make his own record with the assurance that his success will depend upon this alone. I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opinions and to use his means for their advancement, Bhall also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen in refusing all demands upon Lis salary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and jus tice to all who are engaged in the publio ser vice, and likewise contain stringent provi sions against the use of official authority to coerce the political action of private citizens or of official subordinates, is greatly to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service, and especial ly to a reform in the method of appointment and removal, has been found to be the prac tice, under what is known as the spoils system, by which the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by members of Congress. The first step in the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine that "to the victors belong the spoils," inseparable from Congressional patronage as the established rule and practice of parties in power. It comes to be under stood by applicants for office, and by the people, generally, that Representatives and Senators are entitled to disburse the patron age of their respective districts and States. It is not necessary t recite at length the evils resulting from this invasion of the Executive functions. The true principles of govern ment on the subject of appointments to.office, as stated in the National Conventions of the leading parties of the country, have again been ap proved by the American people, and have not been called in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all-important subject are the statement of principles that belong to the constitution al structure of the government. "Under the Constitution, the President and heads of departments are to make nomi nations for office. The Senate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the House of Representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best interest of the 1 1 U U11U HerVll UOlUUftllUE lUH UlOEKl UiDUliUUUllB be respected ; that Senators and Representa tives, who may be judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to office." To this end the co-operation of the legislative de partment of the government is required, alike by the necessities of the case and by public opinion. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with reference to appointments to of fice until, by legislative enactment, the per nicious practice is condemned and forbid den. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed denning the relations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to of fice by the President, and I also recommend that the provisions of section 1767, and of the sections following, of the Revised Stat utes, comprising the tenure-of-office act of March 2, 1867, be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be perma nently done only by the co-operation of the Legislative and Executive departments of the government, I again commend the whole subject to your considerate attention. 

POLYGAMY. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress polygamy where it now exists in our Territo ries, and to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is designed. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. Ihe Mormon sec tarian organization which upholds polygamy has the whole power of maKing and execut- . ing the local legislation of the Territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries it possesses large influence over the adminis tration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the law of Congress on the subject of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law de pends on those who practice and uphold the . crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories is ample. It is not a case for half-way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing : it controls now one of the wealthiest and most popu lous Territories. Xb ih euujiig hhjuuujt in to other Territories. Wherever it goes it es tablishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and the family relation are the corner stone of our American society and civilization. Religious liberty and the separation of Church and State are tne elementary ideas or iree insti tutions. To re-establish the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have imperilled, and to fully re-open to in telligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, in a great degree, closed to general immigration by intolerant and immoral insti tutions, it is recommended that the govern ment of the Territory of Utah be reorga nized. I recommend that Congress provide for the government of Utah by a governor and judges, or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate a government analagous to the provisional gov ernment established for the Territory north west of the Ohio, by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government, I recommend that the right to vote, hold of fice, and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah, be confined to those who neither prac tice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed that within a few years the evils which now af flict Utah will be eradicated, and that this Territory will in good time become one of the most prosperous and attractive of the new States of the Union. OFS RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and nave presented no occasion zor concern as to their continued maintenance. Mv anticipation of an early reply from the British government to the demand of idem nity to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay, in January, 1878, which 1 expressed in my last annual ige, was disappointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and, when received, ex hibited a failure of accord between the two governments, as to the measure of the inshore-fishing privilege secured to our fisher men by the treaty of Washington, of so seri ous a character that I made it the subject Of - a communication to Congress, in which I rec ommended the adoption of the measures which seemed to me proper to be taken by this government in maintenance of the rights accorded to our fishermen under the treaty, and towards securing an idemnity for the in jury these interests had suffered. A. bill to carry out these recommendations was under consideration by the House of Represents- - OONTntUW N fOUBIH
