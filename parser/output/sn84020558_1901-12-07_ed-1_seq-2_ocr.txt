The United States industrial commis sion as not only sought to solve the ever present rerv SOLVING Eut E'rl Problem, THE SERVANT but actually un CHKL. PROBLEM, nounces that It has found the cause of a trouble whi- h is one of the chief topics of conversation at every tea table from Phoenix to Pembina and from Bar Harbor to Santa Monica. The commission reaches the conclu sion that the great diiTicuIty is with the housewife herself. The American v.oman. it finds, is domineering and tyrannical. She wants to hue a per son; not that person's labor. She wants to command, an J insists that the person commanded shall he not only socially inferior, but shall not for--gtt the inferiority. She demands per sonal service, and insists upon com manding all cf the servant's time. In the United States, where the major ity of servants are American born, and where there is a prejudice against tiie drawing of class distinctions, not even the increased compensation which do mestic "help" receives as compared with factory wcrk and similar coin retin employments, is sufficient to overcome the aversion to domestic em ployments. Tne commission in trusted the servant invest ig-ation to Gail I-.aufchlin, a woman L.. L,. H who sent out five thousand printed interrogatories to employers and servants. The conclusion as to the lack of bus iness principles is summed up as follow- : Household lcibor has not had apr'ip to it the economic rrnciples v. iaieh have been applied to other occupations, it has not been put 0:1 a bu-ine'3 ba-siss. The relation of employer and employe is still regarded aj largely a personal relation. A personal -iallon .jetvejn employer And employe incvitablly be comes the relation of superior and in ferior, rather than a contract between equals, and this is what has developed in domestic service. To remove the social stiirma from domestic service, and thus attract into that service a larger n:i:.itcr of intelligent employes, household l.-bor must be established on a business bai.. That household labor r.hould have ap plied to it the business jtrlncriples which are applied to other classes of labor is the opinion of those who have pivpti t he bv-t t houirlir to iiiis suh- iect. Thnt ti is should be done is also j the opinion of quite a number of em ployers who responded to the request of the schediilfs sent out for suggestions of chants advisable in our present domestic servant system. Taking this view, what would be the changes necessary? First, there would have to be definiteness as to the work re-L'ire-i. Specific pivis to be per formed should be the subject-matter of the contract. That this is possible has been shown by the fact that such a contract is. at least rornetirr.es, made with Chinese servants; that the sys tem has proved more sut'sfrictody thm the method now Kcneriil!;.' in voue is the oxnr-?o'l o.-iaion of the employer who reported th far-t.

He fore intelligent Ameilcan women shnll become willing to enter dmr.esttr serv ice in nny Ir.re numbers, this social stigma must be removed. Social dis tinctions ?re. .however, of all thins? most elusive. They cannot be re moved by direct mc3iis. and the social stirma now attached to domestic service can be removed only gradually, through the removal or The conditions which have given rise to it. In speaking of the reason which prevent women from entering domes tic service, rean Marion . r.ilbot, cf the University of Chicago, expressed the opinion that the objections already referred to. viz., indeflnitenesa of hourr. unlit sleeping- accommodations, the impositions of restrictions, etc. were causes of which social position was the result. The reasoning is vlid. but these "conditions are themselves from an underlying cause. That un der! Ing cause i3 the basic principle upon which the whole rystem or domes tic service, as it cxT"'? to lay, rests; and that principle is tlint in domestic ei vii e it is the perron who is hired and not distinctively the labor of the person. In air oth "r occupations it i laboT which H contracted for; in do-rm-siic 3ervice it is. in e.Te;-t, at leart. the laborer. In other f;L-cupat!'ns the conlrat t is for the performance of cer tain specified services; in domsti s-rvl'-e the contract is, usually, for the entire time of the laborer, who i t'isn expected to perform not only certain labor which has been specified, but, in addition to that, is expected to per form whatever service may be re quired: w ho is expected, in short, to be at ail timfs subject tq the call and direction ot the employer. X-'nlversal gratitude awaits the man who can discover just where the ucfect is in our public school HAD system that will nc- FI'EI.LIXH. count for the fact that with the average "edu cation" acquired in thecommon schools there goes an inability to spell. Many theories are advanced to explain why correct spc-liin seems to be a vaniEh ins accomplishment. The explanation most generally accepted is that the schools of today are too much given to fads, the following of which require th? abandonment of the former system of teaching Hpelllns. which made prod- izics of so many pupila. Under the rule of the cominB iceneral in ba. sreMins threatens to be universal, af- llictini the educated not hfss tU:in the .intrained; At the Jiorthwcsteru University (at Chicaso) fully Vol pupils, many whom would have Krsduate.1, have b.-cn set to studying a little green sp-.d lintf book. Prof. Clarke says that large proportion of former graduates were poor spellers, and that it has been decided to withhold parchments here after until the pupils shall have mas tered the a-t of spelling word3 in com mon use. It is not the Northwestern University students alone who shew thi3 defect, but afro those who have been admitted to that institution from other schools. Prof. Clarke has mad' a list of the words which pupils who hoped to receive their diplomas last rear wrestled with in vain. Among them are these, as they were spelled Kxccrcise. tyreny, con-istant, shad.low huiles. wheather, emm-'-nse (immense) dili mna. procead, ai peratus, volumn dispare. dlmcntions, teinparament, be seirre. mischei vons. viili'in. tennent veal 1. vestaite, looscing (Ot losing) oritconal. gi issp y (f. r Ki il ).
