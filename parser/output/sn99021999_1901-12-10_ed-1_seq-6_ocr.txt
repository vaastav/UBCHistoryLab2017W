Tlio Maine senator has been giving very careful study to tills subject since tho last congress and believes he now has a bill that will not encounter tho objections that were made by re publicans In congress to tho bill for merly Introduced and he hopes also that It will receive general popular approval. There Is not a doubt that tho senti ment iu favor of building up an Amer- lean merchant marine for our foreign commerce has grown very much during the past year. The reference to tills subject by President McKinley In his Hulfalo speech, In which hu urged the great Importance of American ships for carrying our products to foielgn mar kets, had a very decided effect upon the public mind, this sentiment belug fur- ther strengthened by what President Kooovelt said In his message regarding tho merchant murine. He declared It to ho dlscredltulilu to us as a nation that our merchant murine should be utterly Inslgnlllcant iu comparison to that of other nations which wo overtop iu ouier loniiH oi iiiisiness, mining unit we should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trilling portion of our urcat commerce is carried In our own ships.

SKW ASIM3CT OF I.IIIKRTY. Marked DlfTrrrnce llrtiTPru (lie It rill nml tli Iilrul. Scrlbncr's Magazine, Thoro is a great deal of novelty nbout tho growing American appreciation of order. Liberty was what tho, fathers fought for whon they won Independence, and liberty was tho watchword of tho nation for n hundred years afterward. Liberty "Llb- rty and union ono and inseparable" was the warcry In our great civil conflict. Llb- rty Is still a word Infinitely dear to ovory truo American, hut experience seems to bo qualifying our dellnltlon of lt. It used to mean self-government, nnd equality nnd fraternity followed after It naturally as part of tho samo mental process. In that senso It is still our Ideal, for all peoples as well as for ourselves; but our theories, na to Its attainment, seem to havo been gradu- lly modified. Wo have como to think a great deal about order, and to suspect that tho liberty which Includes self-government has a price, and that those who cannot pay that prlco must wait for it until they can. That prlco Is order; such a degree of order as will make it potislbla for clvlllzutlon to advance. Wo havo begun to doubt whether liberty Ib at all times, for nil men of nil races, a pnnncca for all political ills. Wo havo begun to discriminate. Wo hold lib erty In our own gift, and refuse, as wo look toward the Philippines, to bestow lt in full measure. "They aro not rlpo for It yet," wo eay. "Thoy aro still children In tho world's great family; wo will glvo them for tho present personal freedom and order, with moro to follow; but full liberty and In depondonco all at onco, we dnro not grant." And then wo wonder not n llttlo if wo are doing right. As to that, heaven knows; but certainly wo nro doing our best. "Pcaco on earth, good will to men," nro sentiments so closoly associated that we may not separate them. Though sometimes our nnxlety to make peace prevail may causo our good will to bo quostloncd, wo may certainly insist how- over doubtful of the comprehensiveness of our wisdom that our obligations ns pro- motors and conservators of tho world's penco aro far too grave to bo neglected In tho Interest of our reputation for mere good-nnture.

It Is an interesting suggestion that for tho avoldanco of great loss of llfo In railway collisions all passenger coaches should bo of a strength equaling tho prescnt Pullmans. Put if tho opinion Is hold that two trains of tho strongest cars can meet whon run ning at a combined speed of fifty or olghty miles tho hour and do llttlo damago to each other or to tho passengors, n llttlo reflection on modorn gunnery will suggest a correc tion. Tho best steel tipped bullets do not collide with tho best of armor plato without d,amagc being dono to tho weaker of tho two surfaces.

"All nround hltn aro men whoso political faith ho onco ex pounded nnd who recognized him ns n worthy exponent.

From a well contained, self-complacent states man Wellington has bocomo extremely nervous. Ho docs not know apparently what to do with his hnnds.

No ono would ever ninko n delicious cako with a layer of dirt between. Yet this Is exactly what has been dono with tho capltol of tho United States. "For many years," reports tho Washing ton Post, "tho senate end ot tho capltol has bcon undergoing n process of bcautlflca tlon.

Ono of tho most unique social organiza tions In the country has recently been formed nt Washington. Tho only Inflcxlblo rulo for membership Is that tho applicant shall havo red hair.

It has nn phllanthroplcnl nor political Ideals nnd thero Is nn danger, should tho Idea spread and become natlntinl In Its scope, of tho H. II. C.'s putting forth n cnndldato for tho presidency. It seems that the society organized in n rebellion against tho nntlquntcd nnd moldy witticisms which red-hnlred people tn nil parts of the civilized and uncivilized world nro supposed to enjoy, or at least to suffer with n sickly protenso of enjoyment. "Just what thero is in tho fact that a person possesses red hair that would call forth tho efforts of tho would-bo wit mny nover bo learned," said a young woman who Is employed nt tho bureau whero tho club originated. "Hut It is truo that from tlmo Immemorial red-haired pcoplo havo suf fered boredom from tho shafts of a certain obnoxious typo of Joker. Yet lt has been left for tho bright-headed employes of this bureau to formulato an organized protest." Tho nlr of mystery which surrounds tho meetings of the members Is a Bourco of great plquo to their fellow rlcrkB. It Is alleged that a constitution nnd bylaws have been drawn up defining tho purposes of tho club nnd that tho president is facetiously referred to ns tho "most lurid luminary," the other ofllccrs and members as satel lites," "lesser lights," etc. A certain young doctor who Is employed In tho bureau Is reputed to be thn presi dent of tho club. Ho not only boasts a shock of bright red hair of tho most np proved color, but rejoices In nn exceedingly luxuriant growth of flaming beard as well. When questioned as to tho authenticity of tho report that ho wns tho president of tho club or rather tho "most lurid lumi nary," tho medical man laughed and re fused to either nlllrm or deny tho report. Tho doctor, In discussing tho society, called attention to the fnct thnt somo of tho greatest personages of history wore red haired. David is described ns a "ruddy youth;" those tressco of tho sainted maid of Orleans, whlrh shono so brightly brncnth the roynl llenr-do-lls of France nnd mingled so pnthotlcnlly with tho leaping flames of Hlielms, aro historical; St. Paul was red haired, the lovely hut Ill-fated Mary queen or Scots had n natural crown or ruddy gold, Julius Caesar and Martin Luther aro al leged to havo had red hair. A pretty good story Is told In Washington nt the expenso of "T'lm" Cnmpboll, formerly a Tammany member ot congress from the lty of Now York. Ono day ho was show ing n number of his constituents about tho capltol, pointing out the various things of Intoreat. When "Tim" and his party en- tere'd statuary hall tho Tammany states man began to explain to his friends what they wcro beholding. Pointing to tho llfo- sized statue of Robert Fulton In a sitting position with n model of his first steam ship In his hnnds, ho said In n rich Irish brogue: "This, gentlemen, Is tho staton of Ilobert ulton, tho invlntor of tho roller sknto." As n matter of fnct, tho model of tho steamboat looks about ns much llko a roller aknto ns lt does liko a river steamer of modern dato nnd lt Is needless to say thnt a majority of "Tim's" constituents had never heard of riobort Fulton beforo nnd nro still undor tho Impression that ho Invented tho roller skato Instead ot tho steamboat. l'Klt.SONAI,

THE MASTER KEY Vv HOIIUItl.M lll'FF.CTS OF OFFICIJ." ! .Sliiiriieiicil INmih of I'rrjtidlcril Critic Lime Tliclr IMkp. Washington Star. It Is observed in quarters not heretoforo friendly to Mr. Itoosovclt that ho is already showlug in tho presidency tho sobering effects of high olllclal responsibility. Ills mt'FK.tgo Is described ns n surprlso becnuso of its conservative tone. Thero seems to havo been tho expectation ot a document bristling with nggrcmlveness townrd tho outside world nnd threatening tho turning J up oi jacK iicro nt uomo. nut, really, upon what was this expectation founded? Upon Mr. Hooscvelt's record ns civil serv ice commlHslonrr? Ha did nothing reckless In thnt olllce, but much that wns wlso and for I ho good ot tho cause. Upon hla record as police commissioner In Now York? Ho shook up tho forco thero from top tn bot tom, but it wns universally admitted that ho did his work admirably and thnt tho city nnd tho forco Itself greatly honeflted. When ho went to tho Navy department lt was freely predicted that ho and Mr. Long would pull together nt tho furthest about a month. Tho ono wns represented ns nil lmpctuousness nnd Impracticability and tho other all soberness and calculation. The two men got nlong llko brothers nnd tho secretnry surrendered his nsslstnnt to tho army with tho greatest roluctanco. Whon Mr. Itoosevelt put on his shoulder straps' thero wcro those who shuddered for his regi ment and his superior olllcer. Thoy did not doubt that thoro would bo n mutiny in enmp and that tho second In command of tho Hough aiders would head It. Ho proved Instead a good soldier nnd was both brave and efllclcnt. Why, then, this comment, bb If a wild man had entered tho Whlto Houso two months ago nnd been tamed thero? As a matter of fact, Is not tho chango In his rltlcs and not In Mr. Hoosovolt? Ho has nlways been nn aggresslvo man, out of tho rdluary in his carrlngo nnd methods, nnd this hns invited speculation nnd no llttlo cnrlcnture. It has grown to be a custom to efor to him ns a fighter, always nn tho nlf-cock nnd spoiling for a row. Much of this was simply good fooling by tho car toonists and tho newspaper paragraphias. ml Bomo of them handled their topic In a ay that even Mr. Kooscvolt himself must hnvo enjoyed. Hut It wns no moro than that, nnd tho Joko Is on those who took It nil BerlotiBly, nnd nro now drnwlng their rst breath of comfort since Mr. Roosevelt became president upon (lading that ho Is not disposed to uso his olllco ns would a cowboy nnd set out with his revolver drawn "smoko" tho United States. This comment, howover. Is n g,ood sign, i It shows that even the most bitterly prejudiced of tho president's former critics know a man when they got tho proper lino on him and aro willing to glvo hi in credit when thoy think ho deserves It.
