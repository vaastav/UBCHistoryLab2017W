NOBTHERN PACIFIC FAEMEB WHITNEY & WHIPPLE, Publishers. WADENA, WADENA, CO., MINNESOTA. CURRENT TOPICS. BUSINESS men at the east are clamoring for a new national bankrupt law, and gener ality favor the Lowell bill now before the judiciary committee of congress. The va ried and conflicting insolvency laws of the states and territories, area perpetual an noyance to business men and a uniform gystern seems to be generally demanded. THE scarcity of cars east of Chicago is severely felt in Minnesota. The Minneap olis milters are compelled to store most of the flour manufactured, and there is talk of shutting down their mills. In the mean time, a large number of elevators where they purchase wheat are filled to overflow ing, and as a temporary relief the millers have sold and are shipping 500,000 bushels to Chicago. REV. DR. J. D. FULTON, a sensational preacher of New York, believes that the perehilia of the planets may have caused diptheria, and that there may be coming on the world calamities that have not been hitherto known, besides plagues, and storms and tidal waves, which will swamp whole cities there are plagues sleeping in the hands of God to which the contagion THERE has been a steady decline for sev eral days past in railroad securities, from the high figures on last week, owing to the active demand for money. In some cases a premium has been paid, in addition to 6ix per cent, per annum. The bank presidents, however, say that millions of dollars are in their vaults for want of use, which is a del icate intimation that proper securities would bring it out. Sioux 

CITY and the country round about is enthused by the discovery of a vein of excellent coal, four and a half feet thick, at Ponca, Nebraska. Prof. Aughey, the Ne braska geologist, declares that the discovery is of incalculable importance. The coal was found at a depth of 580 feet, and measures will be taken at once to sink a shaft and bring it to the surfaee in sufficient quanti ties to supply the demand of that section for cheap fuel. THE great political papers continue to fill their columns with speculations in regard to the composition of President Garfield's cab inet, but as yet nothing is definitely known in regard to the matter. That it will be composed of new material is the only thing that seems to be settled. The discussion brings into prominence a very large number of politicians whose peculiar qualifications for the positions to which they aspire, are not generally recognized. now devastating our homes would be but as a drop before an impending hower. Speak ing particularly of diphtheria, Dr. Fulton says this disease may be the result of a dis turbance in the atmosphere consequent up on the perihelian of the four great planets —Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and Saturn. In 542 and 1665 three of the planets—Mare, Jupiter and Saturn—were in p«rhelion, and these were the worst plague eras of which history has any record. In 1720 Mars and Jupiter were in perihelion, and in the sin gle city of Marseilles, France, 52,000 out of 75,000 of the population died. EVEN those who believe the world is growing better will be surprised at the au thoritative statement, that while New York city has increased 75,000 in the last five years, crime has diminished twenty-five per cent. This cheering result is attributed to a variety of causes, the chief of which are, the influence of the churches the grow ing temperance sentiment, which has been much more marked in other places than in New York the discouragement of wilful pauperism by systematic charities the en forcement of attendance at school, and the punishment of truancy by the authorities, and the extensive mission work among the most degraded and wretched of the popula tion. LAST November is remarkable as the coldest November in ten years. The means during this period are given by the signal service observer at St. Paul, as,follows: 187 1 27.8 1876 29Ai 187 2 23.8 1877 32.4 187 3 26.6 1878 38.3 187 4 28.7 1871) 32.(5 187 5 25.2 1880 22.6 The highest temperature for last Novem ber was 58, on the 3d, and the lowest, 18 degrees below zero, on the 25th. The pre cipitations of moisture was also the larg est in ten years, being 2.93 inches or over an inch more than the average of the month for ten years. SECRETARY THOMPSON'S report on naval affairs refers at length to the object he had in view in sending shipB of war into as many foreign ports as possible, which was to en able the authorities and people of those countries to understand that it is our desire to cultivate with them the most amicable commercial relations, and that both their own interest and ours would be thereby promoted. He recommends an increase of the navy, and thinks that good policy re quires the national government to employ all its legitimate powers to increase, the strength of our mercantile marine and says that the increase of one should be propor tioned to that of the other. THE census tables have not been com pleted but they are in a state of forward ness to warrant the statement that the pop­ ulation of the country was almost exactly 50,000,000 when the census was taken. Al abama, New Hampshire and Connecticut have been nearly stationary for the last ten years, while the largest absolute increase has been in the city of New York and ad joining counties, which from 1,456,631 in 1860, went to 1,765,415 in 1870, and thence to 2,257,282 at the enumeration on the 1st of June last. Facts and exact figures are looked for with a great deal of interest by political economists, and the general public as well, and for a long time will afford fruitful topics for discussions. "THE Story of Endymion"—the title of a new novel by Lord Beaconsfield, just pub lished in London and New York—is having an immense sale, owing more to the name of the author than to its real merits. Near ly all the characters are titled, and even the few plebian personages who begin life as tailors, milliners and lodging-house keepers become railroad kings and baronets, mem bers of parliament and countesses. The ac tion begins at the time when Canning is on his death-bed, and the duke of Wellington is the hope of conservative England, and comes along down to the fifties and sixties. Lord Beaconsfield was paid $60,000 for the manuscript of the work, and the publishers en both sides the Atlantic will be handsome lv remunerated for their large investment. THE flannel question absorbs the Boston mind at present. Many people are certify ing that cotton undershirts, drawers and stockings, are vastly preferable to flannel, in every respect. A leading physician says that the best results are accomplished by wearing cotton in preference to any other article next to the person, because of its being a vegetable product, a fair non-con ductor of heat to and from the body, and also in a small degree an absorbent,—in fact, possessing every essentially good fea ture, and none that are objectionable. The argument in favor of flannels as against cot ton, is not presented, but it is not to be in ferred that cotton will be immediately sub stituted for wool, though experiments are always in order. THE presidential electors of Minnesota, consisting of Joseph A. Thatcher of Good hue county, L. G. Nelson of Kasson, J. T. Williams of Mankato, William Schimmel of St. Peter, and Knute Nelson of Alexandria, met at the State capitol in St. Paul, on Wednesday last, and cast their votes in due form for James A. Garfield for president, and Chester A. Arthur, for vice president. The electors by unanimous vote, elected Hon. Joseph A. Thatcher, of Goodhue county, as messenger to carry the official report and deliver it in person to the vice president of the United States at Washing ton. J. T. Williams was appointed as cus todian ot the returns to be deposited, one in the postoffice in St. Paul, directed to the vice president, and the other to be handed to the United States judge at St. Paul. The electors of all the other States, with the ex ception of Georgia, also met and cast their votes, according to law and in accordance with the popular vote. The Georgia vote is possibly lost to Hancock and English, for non-compliance with law. The statutes of the United States provide, in section 135, that the electoral colleges of the several States shall meet on the first Wednesday of December and cast their votes. The Geor gia code provides that the governor shall notify the electors to meet at the capital on the first Monday of December, to be ready on the Monday following to cast their votes. This the governor has done, but the electors did not meet, and it is thought by leading officials and lawyers that they have no right to meet and vote next week Wednesday. CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY. MONDAY, DEC. 6, 1880. SEXATE.—Forty-eight senators, or nearly two thirds of the entire body, were in their seats at noon. The vice president called the senate to order, and the chaplain offered prayer appro priate to the .occasion. Mr. Brown of Georgia and Mr. Pugh of Alabama were sworn in to fill existing vacancies. Nothing beyond necessary routine business was then transacted, until the arrival of the president's private secretary with his annual message, after the reading of which the senate adjourned. Senator Grover of Ore gon, of whose bad health there has been so much said lately, was present all day. HOUSE.—At exactly noon, the Speaker called the House to order. Number of Members present 227. Tke members from both sides commingled freely and all seemed in the best of humor. Alexander Stephens rolled around in his easy chair, and received the congratulations of members upon his improved health. Gar field's vacant chair and desk was appropriated by Page, of California. The President's mes sage was received about 1:30. Bills and reso lutions were presented from different States, re lating to the tariff for the temporary increase of the Supreme Court Justices by Mr. Con verse, fixing the salary of the Resident at $25,000 per annum, payable monthly by Mr. Ward, appropriating$10io,000for a monument to Gen. Layfette, to be erected on the site of the battle of Brandywine. After the announcement of the death of Bepresentative Farr, of New Hampshire, the House adjourned. A Raid on Oleomargarine. The butter dealers of Chicago have had a conference for the purpose of protecting the trade against adulterated butter and cheese, which are at present flooding the market. Recent exposures of the villianous character of the compounds which are manufactured and sold as butter has greatly damaged busi ness, and rendered some action necessary. The only feasible plan suggested was that dealers in the bogus article be compelled to label it under its appropriate name. The last legislature passed a law requiring this to be done, but no steps have been taken to enforce it, and it is practically a dead letter. Resolutions were adopted requesting the produce exchange to take action towards enforcing obedience to the law and prom ising hearty co-operation. Some $1,200 was raised on the spot to further the object of the meeting, and active war will be made on the disgusting traffic.
