Including the revision of grades and align? ment now tinder way for the pur pore of relieving the crowded con? dition of thor present single track, the- Southern railway company finds It 'difficult to maintain the schedule of. some of Its passenger trains, as now scheduled, and will in conse? quence. In 'the early part, of Jan? uary of the ensuing year, change the schedules, putting them mi the biihln of slower speed, with the ex pc-olaUon of being able to main? tain them and believing thnt under these changes this arrangement wll -e , more satisfactorily to the pub? lic.5 In this connection President Fin J?y says: "The double tracks work Is being very strenuously pushed and on other parts of the road Whor? double track work is not now under way but where traffic 18 heavy, passing train tracks are being put in and those already In extended.

PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS DANGEROUS If Carried Out It Would Thwart Al? most Every Purpose of the Framers of the Constitution?A Strong Speech That Received Marked At tention in the Senate. (By Associated Press.) WASHINGTON, I). C. Dec. 12.? Much Interest wn? munifeated today in the senate on the position taken by Senator Uaynor In his discussion on tho Japanoso question He con? tended that the Inherent right.* of a statd could not be violated by treaty any more than they could be violated by congress, and he cited many adjudicated cases before the Supreme Court and arrayed n long Hue of eminent authorities. iMr. Haynor also gave the cases and au? thorities for tho other side of the proposition. Caustic criticism of President Roosevelt's position of the Japanese question prefaced Mr, Raynor's speech. "If the military and civil forces of the federal government were to be used by the President,' Mr. Knyuor said, "It became very Important to know the exact power of the President in the matter. But, he sab1, it Is a serious matter In view of the great calamity which has recently befallen the city of San Francisco for their contemplated bombardment of the city at this time and to declare war agn.fn^t tho boards, of county school trus? tees of California. There, is no Justi? fication or pretext upon which such ferocious proceedings can be un? dertaken. "The President is exercising n groat many functions executive and Juduclat, lawful nnd unlawful, and unconstitutional. If he is possessed or tho Idea that he Is the Supervis? or of all public schools of the various states of the union, and he seems to be impressed with that Idea In the last paragraph of his mcsi'age wherein he recommends to congress the establishment of shooting galleries In all of the large schools of the country, . we must either disabuse his mind of this fancy or we must let him know that we ngrce with him as to the ominlpotency of his jurisdiction. If he can take possession of public schools of California and compel the state to admit to them Japanese students contrary to the laws of I California he could properly send I us aa addition to the Santo Domingo trenn- and demand the admission of negro children of Santo dmln'go Into the white schools of South Carolina or of any other state of the union. Scores the President. Mr. Haynor concluded with com? ments on tho President's message in praise of the Japanese. His sympa? thies bad, he said, been with them and he thought It a great shame that the Japanese pupil should have boon overpowered In the conference room when she had been very courteous. He proposed, he said, to discuss the ques? tion outside the particular communi? cation nnd plant himself on the two propositions: "First, that there Is no provision whatever in the treaty with Japan that confers the right to the Presi? dent or gives to the government of Japan the privileges it claims, to pub lb: school system of California or any other states. If there was such a pro? vision in this treaty or any other treaty conferring this right, the treaty would be void and without any au? thority on the part of the United Stums to make It in view of the treaty making power of the government." Concluding Mr. Uaynor said: "The power of state to regulate its public schools system Is clearly among its reserved powers. Have we therefore, a right to provide in a treaty with for? eign powers privileges in the public schools of the states that are prohib ed either by the constitution or by the lnws of the state, in which they are? If we can in defiance of laws and constitution of a state Incorporate any such punishment in a treaty, so as to bind a state, then we can de? prive the stale of treaty reserved rights, and rescind nnd annul its laws and Its constitution whenever they come In contact with the treaty. If ever such a deformity as this should creep lato our judicial division it would disfigure the constitution to such an extent that Its features would no longer be capable of recognition. It would annul the characters. It would frustrate the Intention of men who framed It; It would undermine the entire framework of the instru? ment and It would convert the consti? tution into a dictatorship with the states in abject servitude to federal newer and with the executive in prac? tical control of the destinies of the states."
