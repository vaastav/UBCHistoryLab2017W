The plate is crescent shaped, hooked at each end, and having three teeth set at ir regular intervals on it. How it could have passed into his throat is difficult to account for. As soon as he discovered the extent of the accident, Mr. Madegan's first idea vas to send at once for a physician, but Afterwards though* the object might pass through him without difficulty. Eventn* ill/it got into his stomach, and caused' excruciating pain. The case is one of great difficulty, and in its present stage bot little can be doae other than to await the oper ation of nature, assisted by medicine. So surgical operation can. of course, be performed at present, and from the pecu liar formation af the object, it is not easy t^HBS through the stomach and intestines ^frijhout inflicting serious injury. New Toll Gatb.?We understand from Mr. Lunsford, Superintendent of the portion of the Natioual Road passing Jfctfugb Virginia, that a new toll gate is a boat to be established on the top of the bill, east of the city. The road Is intend ed to be a self-sustaining institution, and of lite years it has become sadly ouL of repair. Some ten bridges betweoa 'this city and West Alexander are in want of repair to make the road passable. The road not only bos no money, but \a in debt, and the Superintendent, knowing the im portance of the thoroughfare, has deter mined to establish a new gate at the point indicated, 'as a means of increasing the revenue. The existence of tbis toll gate will not increase the toll of those going to Triadelphih. or points eastward, as tickets will be furnished to through travelers. It is only intended to catch those who use the road between the city and the three mile gate and no further. a Niooaa.?Mr. Snider, one of Vifye members 61, the Legislature, from Mo nongalia, has Introduced into the Legisla ture a resolution, instructing the Commit tee on Courts of Justice to "inquire into |^*he expediency" of so amending sections 26, 27, 28 and 20 of Chapter 108 of the Code of 1860, as to nmke them conform to the spirit And genius of our institutions. These sections prohibit any man from writing or speaking of the institution of slavery, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment. The committee's report will doubtless cause some discussion. J^-Thb WiATHER.?We caonot call to mind the time.in December when we have had such weather as we bare been blessed wilh for the past week. No fires were burning, the windows were opon and the birds were singing as in the Spring.. The state.of the atmosphere yesterday, howev er, warned us that the past few days wero not a correct prognostic of the coming winter, as farmers represent that it will be a severe one, thick buds and bark hav ing formed, and other sure indications | having appeared. 5QT* Obit New Paaas ?We yos terday re ceived a new steam press which is render ed necessary by our large and increasing ^ circulation.

Another shell burst six feet below the water line, causing a bad leak, but the steam pumps kept thejvessel free.
