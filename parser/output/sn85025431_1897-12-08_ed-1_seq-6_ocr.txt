iSOLONS IN SESSION FIRST REGULAR SESSION OF THE FIFTY-FIFTH CONGRESS, Vreildent'i Aferaag* Read Before Both Houses—Cuba and Currency the Frl»« cipal Topics, Though Other Important Matters Were Touched Upon—A Sum nary of the Document. WASHINGTON, Deo. 6.—The regular or long session of congress as it is called, because there is no constitu tional limitation upon the period of its duration, opened at noon. The extra session robbed the opening of the regu lar session of the exoitement and inter est which usually attaches to it. At the opening of a regular session or dinarily Washington thrills with ex citement. The hotel lobbies surge with place hunters in the wake of the vari ous candidates for speaker, clerk, door keeper, etc., the members are strug gling for committee assignments and the air is full of rumors and plots and counterplots. But as the house was completely organized at the extra ses sion and all the committee assignments were made then Washington is now tranquil. After the usual opening formalities the president's message was read in both houses. President McKinley, in his asual mes sage to congress, congratulated it upon assembling ljjider felicitious conditions. Peace and good will with all the nations ef the earth continue unbroken, he says, end we should feel genuine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and unification in all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party prejudice. Beginning with the subject of the finan ces, the president says that while the full effect of the legislation of the extra session has not yet) been realized, what it has al ready accomplished assures us of its time liness and wisdom. The next question pressing for consideration is that of the currency. The evil of the present system Is found in the great cost to the govern ment of maintaining at a parity with gold our different forms of money, and the ex perience of the past four years has demon strated that this is not only an expensive charge upon the government, but a dan gerous menace to the national credit. It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated redemptions. We have (900,000,000 of currency which the govern ment by solemn enactment has under taken to keep at par and nobody is obliged to redeem in gold but the government, Which must borrow the gold. Fay Out Greenbacks for Gold Only. He recommends that as soon as the re ceipts of the governments are quite suf ficient to pay all the expenses of the gov ernment that when any United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. The president invites careful considera tion for the detailed plan of the secretary of the treasury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs with him in the recommenda tion that national banks be allowed to is sue notes to the faoe value of their bonds deposited that the circulating tax be re duced to one-half of 1 per cent, and that national banks may be established with a capital of $J5,000. He also recommendE that the issue of national banks be re stricted to the denomination of $10 and upwards and that they be required to re deem their notes in gold. The Cuban Difficulty. Turning to foreign affairs, the presi dent devotes much space in his message to a consideration of the Cuban question, which he says is the most important prob lem with which our government is now called upon to deal in its foreign rela tions. Summarizing the history of for mer outbreaks, the president comes doWn to the present insurreotion, speaking of its remarkable increase, its tenacious ex istence against enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread destruction of property and the disregard of the civil ized code of war on both sides. He says these conditions give rise to gravest ap prehensions. There is no desire on our part to profit by Spain's misfortunes, and we have only the desire to see the Cubans enjoying that measure of self control which is the inalienable right of man. Of the concentration policy of Weyler, he says: "It has utterly failed as a war measure. It is not civilized warfare—it is extermination.". Against this abuse of the rights of war the president says he has felt constrained on repeated occasions to enter the Firm and Earnest Protest of this government. He outlines his in structions to Minister Woodford, which were in substance to impress upon the Spanish government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by reaching a peace ful and lasting result, just and honorable to Spain and to the Cuban people. It waj also asked whether Spain of her own voli tion should no* make proposals for settle ment, «nd it was said that he could not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment of this result. The Spanish reply to Mr.Woodford was, in the president's opinion, in the direc tion of abetter understanding. It admit ted our friendly purposes and deep inter est, and declared that the new govern ment was bound to a change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end political reforms will be put into effect and military operationt conducted on humane lines. It was suggested that £jpain be left free to conduct military op erations and grant political reforms, while the United States for its part should enforce neutral obligations and cut off the assistance which the insurgents, it was asserted, received from this country. Early and complete pacification is hoped for. Have Mot Neglected Our Duty. The president declares that the Spanish disposition to charge us with failure to meet international duties is baseless and points to the efforts this government has made at the cost of millions and by the employment of the administrative ma chinery of the nation to perform its full duty. Premising that through out all the horror and danger to our own peace, the United States has never abrogated its right to determine its policy as. to Cuba, the president points out that of untried measures there re mains only: Recognition of the insur gents as belligerents recognition of the Independence of Cuba neutral Interven tion to end the war by imposing a ra tional compromise between the contest ants an intervention in favor of one or the other party. He says: "I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot be thought of. That by our code of morality would be criminal aggression-" Belligerency Not a Good Tiling. Taking up the question of belligerenoy, the president quotes at length from Presi dent Grant's message of Dec. 7, 1875, wherein he declared that the condition in Cuba warranted neither the recognition of independence nor the recognition of belligerency. He adds that moreover a recognition of belligerency would confer upon neither party to the conflict a status not theretofore actually possessed while it would weigh heavily in Spain's behalf, giving her the right of search on fhe high seas and extending her maritime rights to the margin of our territorial waters. "For these reasons," says the president, 1 'I regard the recognition of the belliger enoy of the Cuban insurgents as now un wise and therefore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter be deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty, the executive will take it." Hopeful Ch inee in Spain's Policy. He points to the hopeful change in the Spanish policy to the pledge of reform and to the abatement of the horrors of war as reasons against Intervention on humanitarian grounds. The first acts of the new government lie in the honorable paths it has outlined the policy of exter mination has been reversed broad olem encies proffered measures have been tak en to relieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it is as serted, is to be used, not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protect the resump tion of agricultural industries. The president sketches the auton omy scheme of the Spanish government and says that it was honestly due to Spain that she should be given a reasonable lhance to realize her expectations and to prove the asserted efficacy of the neW order of things, to which she stands irre vocably committed. He points to the many concessions already made, to the modification of the horrible order of con centration, to the release of the Competi tor prisoners, and the fact that not a single American citizen is now under arrest in Cuba. He says the near future will demonstrate whether righteous peace is likely to be attained. If not, the ex igency of further and other aotion by the United States will remain to be taken. Annexittlon of Hawaii. The president next takes up the subject of the annexation of Hawaii which, he says, should be accomplished. The president says of the international monetary commission that, notwithstand ing diligent effort, the envoys have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratifi cation is expressed at the action of France in this matter in joining in our efforts and it is said that the negotiations are still pending. Meanwhile the envoys have not made their final report, believing that the doubts raised in certain quarters respect ing the possibility of maintaining parity between gold and silver may yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes that their labors may bring about an international agreement. Protection of Reals. Reference if made to the recent confer ence at Washington on the subject of pro tection of seal life, the result of which place beyond controversy, it is said, the duty of the government's concern to adopt measures without delay for the protection of the herds. Negotiations to this end are now in progress. International arbitration is declared by the president to represent the best senti ment of the civilised world, and treaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines without in any way imperiling our interests or honor will have his con stant encouragement. The Civil Service. The president devotes the last chapter of his message to the civil service, the practical improvement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest discus sion, and which has of late years received increased legislative and executive ap proval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving vet eran soldiers to reinstatement has been asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefully guarded against the examinations improved and made practical, and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dismissal upon all cases where incompe tency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been done without impairing the power of re moval, one of the vital safeguards of the system. Much remains to be done before the system can be perfected, and the pres ident says that he shall not hesitate to exempt cases whioh he thinks have been properly included in the classified service or include those which in his judgment will best promote the public service. The system has the approval of the people and it will be his endeavor to uphold and ex tend it. Kansas Pacific Snie, Speaking of the pending sale of the Kansas Pacific railroad it is said that if no better bid is received than the upset price fixed by the court the government would receive only 12,500,000 on its claim of nearly $12,000,000. He believes that the government has the authority te bid on the road and has directed the secretary of the treasury to make the deposit of $900,000 required to qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the principal of the debt to the govern ment. He suggests, however, that in a matter so important as the government becoming a possible owner of the railroad, congress should enact some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him, how ever, that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one-half the principal of its debt and less than one-fifth of its entire debt, principal and Interest. Department Reports. Concluding the message, the president says: I am forced by the length of this mes sage to omit many important references to affairs of the government with which congress will have to deal at the present session. They are fully discussed in the departmental reports, to all of which I in vite your earnest attention. The estimates of the expense of the government by the several departments will, I am sure, have your careful scrutiny. While' the congress may not find It an easy task to re duce the expense of the government, It should not encourage their increase. These expenses will, in my judgment, ad mit of a decrease in many branches of the government without injury to the public service. It is a commanding duty to keep the appropriationsVithin the receipts of the government and thus avoid a deficit.
