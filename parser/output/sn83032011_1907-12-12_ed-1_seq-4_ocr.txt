The Presidential campaign goes oil apace. The .'election of Chica go as the meeting place of tlie Re publican National Convention is not iooke J upon as favorable to the wing of '.lit party that wears by Roosevelt. It is further asserted that there is no lenger a doubt of the colie-tion of avast sum of mon ey to secure the selection of some candidate unfavorable to the Roose velt policies. A part of the game is to swing New York for Hughes, not because of any love for Hughes, but out of resentment toward the Administration. In the Democratic camp Mr. Bryan has announced a policy of r ,rgive and forget and made peace nil his bitter opponents in Illinois. . is alleged that he has also cap- red the support of Murphv and jnners iu New York. But he has jt succeeded in suppressing the growing discontent with his candi dacy iu the South, uor in checking the evident undercurrent of public favor toward Judge Giay. There is no doubt that the mon ey panic, which has unsettled the business of the country, has also in large measure unsettled political conditions. There is an unmistak able drift of sentiment in both par ties in favor of a new deal, We have been going a little too fast. With the disposition to moderate our pace there is a concurreut dis position to moderate our methods and to take counsel of more moder ate statesmen. Record. Another Defect in Election Law. It has been discovered that a rather serious defect exists in the uniform primary election law of Pennsylvania, which may deprive the State of delegates to the nation al conventions, or in any event cause successful candidates no end of trouble. The law fails to provide for the certification ot the primary vote in congressional districts, except where a county comprises a district. It has been suggested that the county commissioners certify the returns to the secretary of the Com monwealth or the State committee, but not even such a suggestion is made in the law. It is possible that the national conventions will be forced to deter mine the claims of delegates in the various counties. The Washington county commissioners will submit the matter to the State department and request that some solution of the difficulty be suggested. XING OSCAR OF SWEDEN. This well-beloved, and most democratic monarch of Europe died in Stockholm on Sunday. He had been king of Norway and Sweden since 1872, and his long reigu was one of constant endeavor to benefit his subjects. He is succeeded by his eldest son Oscar Gustave Adolphe, Duke of Vremland. Republican National Convention. The Republican National Com mittee has selected Chicago as the place for holding the national con vention next year, on June 16. Whether they will nominate Taft or Fairbanks or Foraker is a mat ter of doubt. Roosevelt has again declared that he will uot be a can didate for a third term. IN THE COUNTY Surplus 8150,000. THEN AND NOW. Crisis ot 1093 end U07 Compared. The Saturday Evening Post last week said: "In the monetary crisis of 1893 gold flowed rapidly out of the country. Europe drew a hundred millions of the metal from us in that year. If you are hungry and somebody takes away what food you have, recusation, obviously, will be slow. Within a i'cw days following the monetary crisis of h;o7 we drew twenty -five millions of gold from Europe, and sharp advances in European dis count rates did not at once check the movement. Our need of gold was, in fact, much more urgent fourteen years ago ; but we couldn't get the metal. We simply did not have the financial power to com mand it. We have that power now, and the fact gives, in a nutshell, the difference between the two peiiods. In 1893 we could give 11 conclusive assurance that we would pay in gold. Our legal dollar was coin," which might mean a hun dred cents' worth of gold or sixty cents' worth of silver. Europe was disinclined to take the chances. The law of 1900, making gold the standard, removes that handicap. lint tnere is not much use in Lav ing a gold dollar on the statute- book unless you have it in your pocket, too. One of the forerun ners of the real panic was a pretty universal condition of insolvency among those concerns that made a special business of lending money on western farm lands. In 1892, 1893 and 1894 the west was broke. Production of wheat and corn those three years was under six billion bushels against ten bil lions in 1904, 1905 and 1906 ; wheat averaged fifty-five cents against seventy-eight. Cotton production was twenty-three million bales against thirty-five millions the last three years ; the price eight cents against eleven. Total bank de posits in 1893 were 4 billions against billions now. In 1904 the Treasury's stock of gold was sixty-four millions against 280 mil lions in October, 1907 ; total gold in the country, 598 millions against 1432 millions. Everybody now knows what Uncle Sam's dollar is, and that he's got the dollar. AN APPALLING MINE DISASTER. An explosion occurred in the coal mines at Monongah, West Virginia, on Friday last, which is the most appalling disaster of the kind that ever happened. Five hundred men were imprisoned in the mines, and there is no doubt that most of them are dead. A few charred bodies have been recovered, but the res cuers have been prevented from entering the mines any distance on account of the deadly gas. It was occasioned by black damp, and it is said the miners did not use safety lamps. Ayer's Cherry Pectoral cer tainly cures coughs, colds, bronchitis, consumption.

March 12 the Oale tor Sonators and Rop resenlalivcs March 10 lor County offices. All those who are candidates for congress or state senator, must .lie their petitions with the scretaryof the Commonwealth not later than at noon 011 Saturday, March 12th, four weeks before the piimaries Those who desire to run for the legislature or for any county office must file their petitions with the commissioners not later than Satur day, March 19th, at noon. The petitions will then be tabulated in proper order and placed upon the ballots which are to be used by the Republicans, Democrats and any other partv represented on the tickets. This work will take week, allowing another week in which to print the ballots and the latter after their completion must be placed upon file at the com missioners' office at least a week before the primarv election for public inspection. The corrupt practices act, which is a sort ol a companion law to the uniform pri maries act, under which the pri marics are conducted provides for the hlme di a statement within thirty days after the election by all who were candidates before the election whether successful or other wise. If the candidate wins or not he is compelled, under the law, to observe this formality and is sub ject to a fine of $50 and arrest and imprisonment if lie dwe-.s not coin ply with the provision He can also be prevented from taking bis oath of office. Thrse expense statements are to be filed with the clerk ot the courts and a minimum charge of fifteen cents is made for tlie filing. If the expense incurred by the candidate is under $50 he may simply state Hint fact without going into any detailed statement of his expenses. But if the amount spent bv him is larger than $50 he must detail each r.em and where the cost e'f the same has been over $10 he must accompany with the voucher used in payment. The legitimate expenses which a candi date may incur consist of advertis ing, paying watchers, disseminating intormation, for messengers, for postage and the like. No expendi tures of sums where there is no re turn made to the candidate are per mitted, and when contributions are made to political organizations, either in monev or other valuable thing, the candidate is liable to a heavy fine and imprisonment. No registration fee is lcgsl or permitted under the new act and when con tributions are made by others to a candidate for the purpose of aiding him in his fight these contributions must be set forth explicitly.

Husbands and fathers cannot afford to treat this matter lightly. Nearly 500,000 Aliens Country. Flee the Almost Twice at Many at Went Back to Europe Last Year. A New York dispatch says: Whether it is because of the "hard times" cry or the natural incliua tions of mankind at the Christmas tide to seek again the native heath, the fact remains that the flight of aliens from the country has reach ed startling proportions. In motley throngs they crowd the tteerage rails of nearly every outgoing steamer, and wave adieus to their less fortunate brethren who, on ac count of lack of accommodations, have been forced to remain here until another steamer is ready to take them. Four liners sailing Friday took in the aggregate 8000 aliens, most ly Italians. It is believed by steam ship authorities that the height of the eastbound rush will be reached this week and that the number of aliens to depart will have reached half a million. The exodus this year has been so great that it has greatly hampered the dispatch of freight, and several lines will press into service special steamers to re lieve the congestion of goods 011 their piers. The figures showing the emigra tion of this and last year are inter esting. To November 23 of this year 447,000 persons had sailed eastward, while last year for the same period only 293,500 had de parted. In November of last year 4 '.933 persons sailed to the East, while last month the number was 96,724.

Considerable interest and appre hension is shown by officers of Ira ternal and beneficial societies be cause of the recent opinion given by Auditor General Young that the invested funds of such organi zations be taxed by the State, in the same manner as private person al property is. The tax rate is four mills ou the dollar and as the in vested wealth of all the beneficial societies is estimated at more than $15,000,000 the tax would be a heavy drain on the funds. The Odd Fellows would be the heaviest losers, as they would have to pay tax on $5,000,000. The Masonic fraternity has almost $3,- 000,000 liable to the tax, and the Patriotic Sons of America about $1,000,000. The Elks also have a large amount invested for benevo lent purposes.
