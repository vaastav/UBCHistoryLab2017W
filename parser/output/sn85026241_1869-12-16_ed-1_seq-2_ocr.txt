MmonUCQronicfr ST. CLAIRSVILLE, OHIO: Thursday Morning, Dec. 16, 1S6. The Democratic State Central Cork-1 mittee at their meeting at Columbus last Thursday determined to hold their next State Convention on tlie first of June. The Eight of January is played out, as a time far holding Democratic! Conventions. The President's message meets with universal approval. The Republican press regard it as a moddel of clearness and perspicuity, and its recommenda tions as wise and statesmanlike. The Democratic papers of respectability and character concede its merits and affirm that it is a better message than they expected to get from the President. THE 

NORTHWEST RAILROAD. We are somewhat surprised at the general favor with which our renewal of the question of building a Rail rood from the river via St. Clairsville, Flifsh iug and Freeport to Uhrichsville has been received. From the manner in which leading men here and at other points along the proposed route talk( and express a willingness to subscribe, we are of the opinion that a well organ ized and thoroughly pressed effort would result in the construction of the Road. It would certai&iy in the end make a paying road, and would pass through one of the richest portions of Eastern Ohio. It Will be seen by items in our local columns, copied from the Nolle County Republican, than the Marietta, Caldwell and Washington road is likely to be pressed to a rapid completion. That road will ultimately find a northern and eastern connection by going down Stillwater cieek to Uhrichsville and tapping the Pan Handle, and the road contemplated from Uhrichsville via New Philadelphia to the north. If capital enough could be raised to put the work under contract from the mouth of Little McMahon's Creek to Freeport in Har rison county, a distance of about twenty five miles, there is no doubt but the other end of it would be completed at a very early day. We believe this road can be built, if the stock now owned by the County in the Central Ohio Railroad was transferred to it, and such a transfer is practicable, and would prove in the end profitable. Shall the Road be made? Friends of improvement answer. At a meeting of the Republican State Central and;Excutive Committees, at Columbus last Wednesday, resolutions were passed congratulating t he people of Ohio on the Republican triumph in the State and thanking the Executive Com mittee for their efficient service, the following was unanimously adopted : Resolved, That it is highly important that county central committees be elect ed by the several counties at the time of holding the convention for the selection of delegates to the State convention, and that the State Executive Committee are hereby instructed to issue a circular to the several county committees, setting forth the need for this uniform practice, and requesting them to insert in their call for a county convention the an nouncement that the County Central Committee will be selected at that time. AS that part of the President's mes sage referring to the modification of the revenue laws was somewhat obscured by errors in the telegraphic report, we re publish the corrected copy, as follows: "The subject of the tariff and inter rt nal taxation will necessarily receive your attention. The revenues of the s country are greater than the require Ml. - meats, and may with safety be reduced, Mr but as the funding of the debt, in a four or a four and a half per cent, loan would reduce the annal current expense large ly, thus, after funding, justifying a great er reduction, I suggest a postponement of the question until the next meeting of ( Congress. It may be advisable to modi fy taxation ami tariff in instances where unjust and burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws, but a gen eral revision of the laws regulating this subject, I recommend the postponement of for the present. "I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes, but at a reduced rate, say of three per cent., aud this tax to expire in three years. With the funding of the National debt, as here suggested, I feel safe in saying that the taxes and revenue from imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eight millions per annum at once, and still further reduced from year ta year, as the resources of the country are developed." Flushing Correspondence. Having noticed in the last number of the St. Clairsville Gazette, an article by some fellow styling himself " Citizen, " written in reply to our communication in a late number of the Chronicle, we thought it might not be amiss briefly to refer to it at this time. WeTire glad to see that our worthy " Citizen " has taken some pains to give to the people of Belmont County a more detailed and betterauthenticated history of the rise aud progress of the town of Flushing jban we did, and we commend him for it!? It was notour business to give statis tics and we dare nothing for his com ments upon that part of our local; we may say however, that his statement in regard to buildings is false, for every man who has lived in the town for twenty years, knows that not more than a dozen have been erected in that time. It needs only a slight examination of his criticism to show how lightly he has touched our subject. He has endeavored by pointing out what he considers false hoods in our statistical history to turn the minds of the people from our portrait of hi friends and their dark sin which grinds because it is truth. We have as much respect for our honored citizen Jesse Brandenburgh as he has. Yes, " the old man saw his sons and grand sons leave our town as soldiers in the late war, " and now that his locks are white with age and his tottering foot steps verging toward the grave, he is compelled to see them assailed by a more deadly foe, and one that seeks their eternal destruction. He will not thank our "citizen" for sending his name to the St. Clairsville Gazette as a " Grogshop " advertisement. We gave a suffiofhU list of our places of business to show to the Editor of the Chronicle and to the world, that we can not only minister to the bodily com fort of our-visitors, but that there are those among us so vile and inhuman that they delight in destroying their fellow heings by administering poison. We wonder that this modern histo rian forgot the whisky shops, he may however have omitted them remember ing that we noticed them under another name. His interest in these establishments is like that of a young man whom we once met, carrying a whisky bottle, and who told us that lie had "an interest in a saloon in New York City," "yes" replied a bystander "and all others whenever you can find them." We wonder too that our thoughtful " citizen " does not venerate that old dilapidated building that was once a schoolhouse, the work of those "worthy old veterans " and the place whie he and his children have been taught what little they ku w. He says it is the only thing in town he is ashamed of; he is not even ashamed of himself when he occasionalhgets so blind from the ef. fects of his coveted dram that he cannot see Ills co.nrades who are reeling about under the same delirium. He wants to know what there has been in the career of the Editor of the Gazette "so Iniquitous and dishonorable to the county." We would say to our vener able citizen that he has made his paper what we called it before "a journal of rowdyism," an organ for the whisky ring and not ouly the man who has been, guilty of illegal traffic in whisky, but every oue who wished to cover his badge j of dishonor, naturally seeks and finds a , refuge uuder his protecting arm; dis-i grace to hiscowardly name! Ve repeat that it was not our business to give sta liittics, but to show why it is that men may fearlessly come into our midst and "scatter woe where Heaven has planted joy." That there were witnesses sum moned before that jury whose testimony if taken and regarded would have in dicted parties in this town for violation oflthe liquor law can be proven beyond a doubt; and our adversary knows that in these words we speak the sentiments of our enterprising, temperate and intel ligent citizens, aud no devices of his can ever remove the impression from their minds; they look with shame and con tempt Upon the cowards whose infamous action will make drunkards and drunk ards grave! And how wHl you who dare with your poison drug, drain the life blood from your brother ta one for this foul crime? Wi.en ihe aged sire with one foot standing on the other shore raised to God his leeble voice in behalf of his wretched son, what will you do for him that his gray hairs may not go down with sorrow to the grave? Can you dry the tears of that weeping mother? or restore to the monrning widow whatshe has lost iu the ruin of her husband, the father of her helpless children? Will you feed the little ones when they cry for bread, or raise an answer when they call their father? And now for the vic tim who law fouud a drunkards grave, can you restore to him the breath of life, or give to God a ransom for his soul? And will you then pursue your work of death. Oh wretched men, can facts like thixs not, move vour hearts of stone? 

SUBSCRIBER. California Correspondence. SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., Dec. 4, 1869. Dear Chronicle: From this sunset land with all its lovely and attractive scenery, its energetic people fair wo men and brave men, our thoughts still turn to the old places, and to the asso ciations of by-gone years, and I feel an almost irresistible desire to give you some items from this coiHitry. In many respects there have been wondrous changes here siuce the well remembered time twenty years ajro when so many of our friends went out from among us and set their faces toward the setting sun the land of sunshine and of gold. A beautiful city now stands here, where then clustered a few U-nte aud miserable shanties among the Sand hills. The sails of many lands now whiten this beautiful bay, and the finest Steamers in the world are busy plying between this and Asiatic Ports, empty ing upon these shores thousands of a heathen people. The streetsare thronged with an active, energetic and intelligent people, enjoying every luxury of life which monej can buy, or taste conceive. But unchanged are the lofty moun tain peaks we see across the bay. The ocean still lashes with unwearied wash the shores of the great sea, th broad valleys still bask in the same warm sun shine, and the generous soil yields up its products with the same lavish hand. One who has never visited this coast cannot imagine tne difference in every respect which exists between the cli mate here and that of home. I write now by au open window into which the warm sunlight floods the room as it only does at home in June. Across the street is a beautiful garden and lawn in which are growing a countless variety of flow ers in full bloom. An oleander grove defies the climate. A hedge of lemon geranium six feet high and so thick that a bird could not fly through it screens the back garden, and is covered with flowers. A huge fuschia is trained over the pillar of the veranda, aud its sprigs hang thickly studded with blossoms. Down street yonder two blocks away is a fruit stand on the side-walk where you can find pears, apples, grapes, straw berries, orauges, figs and linies, fresh, large and jucy. In the markets are new potatoes, green peas, new radishes and onions, lettice, and everything of early spring. In fact it is their spring time here. The grass is springing green flowers enamel the meadows, the past ure lands and the roadside, and fill the air with richest perfume- It is hard to realize that you are shivering over fires at home, but when we glance at Mt. Diavolo's lofty peak across the bay and see it covered with snow, we read of the coiy fireside: of home, and know that the people of this chosen land are de nied one precious boon the, winter fire side. I had a call the other day from Mr. McElroy, formerly of St. Clairs.ille, who was a printer in the Chronicle of fice years ago when the writer hereof was a "toddlin wee thing" and had only learned the pie making part of the print ing business at the office, and the pie eating part of the business of life at the bouse. Many of your old subscribers will remember McElroy who used to carry the papers through the country on the traditional black pony of the office, before cross mail lines were estab lished. He is now running to Panama on the steam packets, and is in the Cus toms department. Another gentleman from St. Clairs ville is here, Judge M. P. Deady, of Oregon. He is holding court in this city, and enjoys a splendid reputation on the bench throughout all the Pacific States. 1 He still remembers his home of twenty years ago, and talks of the old times with great pleasure. He is favorably mentioned for the new U. S. Circuit Judgeship for this circuit, and I sincere ly trust he may get it, for he is in every way qualified for the place. Then he is also a worthy graduate of our dear old , village, and toward all such my heart goes out wherever they are scattered up and down the world. I would advise every body that wants ' to take a pleasure trip to come here. Take a ride over the Pacific Railroad see the boundless prairies it traverses, 1 and the dizzy heights it cli in lis look up at the peaks of the snow clad mountains, crawl along their rocky sides and look . down into their awful gorges, rnd then , go to the verge and look off on the waste of waters and see where the sun sets, and you cannot help but go home with ' broader ideas of our great country, her resources aud her future. Old fogies at home hardly believe in the Pacific Rail- , road yet, and those who do, think it a , great risk of life to pass over it. Hear my experience ! We left Omaha at noon on Thursday, and reached here on Sunday evening in time for supper ' 76 hours. This we did without change of cars, and it was the most comfortable ride of my life. Our meals were served on the train while in motion, and were in every respect first class. In our sa- , loon car was every thing needed for ' comfort. We had a large rich toned parlor organ, from which we had excel lent music, and from the summit of the mountains we made the startled echoes ring to the melody of the grand old Doxology, sung "with the spirit and with the understanding." There is nothing insecure, and no i thing carelessly done on the road but on the contrary it is the best railroad I ever traveled over, and you know I have traveled over many In the East mm States. To see California thoroughly one must take two or three months, and even then he will go home to learn that he , had left unseen many beautiful and in teresting spots. If weather permits I ' shall try to see it in detail, and leave as little of it unseen as possible. To do this takes a good deal of time, and I re- 1 gard it as time well spent. In some of these wanderings I may scribble you ; some notes of travel. Do not think from the gushing man ner in which I praise the Pacifto Road that I was a dead head over it. for I as sure you I paid my passage to the ut B. R. C. The Cardiff Giant. From the Chicago Tribune. The Eastern States, particularly .New, York, has been excited for a consider- t able time over the discovery of a petri- I tied giant in the vicinity of Syracuse. It has been a matter of wonder, this "Car- diff giant," as it is called, and it attract- j ed the attention of scientific men and of i the public generally. The Colossus of i Rhodes, between whose legs ships of the I largest tuuage, aud with the tallest : masts, could sail, was nothing compared l to this modem man of stone, or what- ever he is made of. He was put down t as the eighth wonder of the world a t genuine wonder, with nothing bogus s about it. People enjoyed the delasion, and there was a chance of speculators and show- t men making a fortune out of it. for one i of them paid $15,000 for one-sixteenth of the delusion which would make the . entire delusion worth $240,000. That is t a uice cash value for a delusion: indeed, ; so valuable is it that it is . Imost cruel to j dispel it and prove the whole affair a j successful hoax and a monster humbug. , Yet such is the fact, for, like Barnum's , woolly horse, this "petrified cuss," as t he has been irreverently called was , made to order, and made very well, be- s cause he was made in Chicago. We can ; manufacture antiquities as easily almost , as we make pork out of hogs. If the J East wants any goods in that line, they can be procured in Chicago, without c difficulty, and pretty cheap at that. ' There is very little doubt that the whole thing is one of the hngest "sells" ever , perpetrated on an intelligent and dis- ( criminating public. The following article, written to the ' Dubuque Times, by a gentleman living , at Fort Dodge, Iowa, throws more light , on the mystery than it can bear: , "About the 6th of June, 1868, two men came to this place and stopped at the St. !j Charles Hotel, registering as George Hall, of Binghamton, New York, and H. B. Martin, of Boston, Massachusetts. " For a number of weeks after their ar- . rival here, their movements seemed to be of a very suspicious character. They J would wander about town, apparently , with no definite object in view, telling , no one anything about their business, J or what brought them here, and in fact, their mission to this place seemed, to all who saw and watched them, a mysteri ous one. , "A few weeks after their appearance ' in our midst, they purchased an acre of gypsum land of John McDermott, pay- ' irig for the same $100. They then bought 1 lumber enough at an expense of seventy- a five dollars, to build a shanty near the a quarry. After everything was ready, c they employed men and went to work c opening the gypsum quarry for the pur- f pose, as they said, of getting out a hand- ' some piece of aypsum, to take to New ' York, to be there placed on exhibition. After working a number of days in this 1 quarry, they discovered that they would c be unable to get out as large and perfect 1 a block as they desired. They then 8 -.hanged their base of operations, and .', went to work on section thirty-three, ' where they found a piece that suited their purpose. They then, with great " difficulty, loaded it on a wagon, and started for the railroad with it, a dis- ' tance of forty-five miles, aud after going 9 a short distance, the wagon broke down. a Hall and Martin then went to work and dressed the stone down to a length of eleven feet and three inches, and a breadth of three feet and two inches, v They then succeeded in getting it to the ( railroad without much further trouble i beyond breaking down one or two t bridges. c "Now, these are facts that caa be a vouched for by hundreds of our citizens, i and the men who assisted in getting out c the monster stone. In view of the fact r that the so called giant which was dis- t covered near Syracuse had been pro- t nounced no'hing more than a gypsum t statue and measured just ten feet two ( inches and a half from the crown of the I baud to the hollow of the foot ; and from f point to point of suoulder, three feet ; a and about twenty-six inches through, o and that this same Hall was seen near C .Se well's, on whose larm the statue was i found, the same day that an iron-bound t box was seen on the way near Newell's, o drawu by four horses, and that he was o seen next morning about two miles from C there, his clothe all muddy ,aud having b to all apperance been out ail night, we ( can come to no other conclusiou than that the Syracuse or Cardiff giant was a manufactured out of Fort Dodge gyp- t mm, aud that it was buried where it t was fouud by this same Hall, who was I. here. v "Our theory is this : Hall and Martin b came here and got the gypsum block 'I out, took it to Chicago, where it was t carved aud worked into a statue. It was then boxed and taken to Binghamton, ii or some other point, and, thence by wa- o gou, to Newell's farm, where it was o fo.ind. Hall was seen in Chicago three t or four weeks, and still after that, by Governor Gue' of this place,and a num- t ber of other persons living here. We o have a strong suspicion that Colonel c Wood, formerly of the Chicago Museum, s is concerned in the'sell,' else why should , , he happeu to be around just at the time $ when they were digging the poor 'giant' out , and a showman was needed to ex hibit it." j, The man who carved the man out of r the block of gypsum is in C iicagoto- j day, aud nothing but his pecuniary iu- t terest in the stone gentleman prevents ft him from exposiug the entire joke. He tl is a cleaver workman, and a smart fel low generally, and withal a humorous being. He laughs in his sleeve at the L'ommotiou he has kicked up. He won ders, no doubt, that men are so easily gulled, and thinks the public has not J cut its eye-teeth yet. By the way he l' would like au order from the East, or ? inywhere else foradozeu or two'giants.' !' He will guarantee that they will be J1 "petrified human beings," and no mis- t: take, aud wishes to inform bis costomers P that his wholesale rates are moderate. j:' If the savants of New York want a " pure and unadulterated relic of a long- ' gone age. they can invest in the Whea- j" ton mastodon, which was not made In j' Chicago, but thousands of years ago "growed," as Topsy said of herself. a rhis thing of "selling the world on an ild stone giant is played out. It is time the truth was made known and the bub- bie burst. A nice problem in the rule 11 if three is, if a bogus-stone giant, man- ! u fact u red iu Chicago aud transported to J New York, is wrrth $240,000, what is 0 the value of a genuine mastodon twenty two feet long, fifteen feer high and six n feet broad. That Cardiff fellow is no man at all, and never was anything but b i stony and hardened impostor. r How We are Reducing the Public Debt. Democratic papers ganerally are clamor- tl ius for au economical administration of our public affairs. We are doing ptetty well in that direction as the following figures from the N. Y. Tribune demon- s; Urate. They show not only economy in the public service but also au honest Application of the moueys collected.
