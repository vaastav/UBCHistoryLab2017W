ANGRY AT ENTENTE DEMOCRATS TO ATT AC X A DMINISTRA TION. Senators Insist Japanese lender standing Is Treaty Real Treaty Expected. [From The Tribune Bureau. ] Washington, Dec. B.— Democratic Senators are preparing for a violent attack on the adminis tration, based on the allegation that the diplo matic notes exchanged between the Secretary of State and the Japanese Ambassador are in the nature of a treaty, and should, therefore, have been submitted to the Senate for Its approval. Senator Bacon is particularly "worked up" over the "situation," and while he is decidedly mys terious over his plans it is certain that he wilt attempt to embarrass the administration, and it is probable that in this worthy purpose he will have the assistance of, the Democratic leader. Senator Culberson. Senator Rayner is also understood to be preparing a pyrotechnic speech on the subject. The Republican .Senator? are disposed to treat the Democratic "discovery of a constitutional violation' 1 -with levity. They point out, as The Tribune lias already done editorially, that there Is ample precedent for such exchange of notes, and that they are jn no way binding on ei:h<«r government, although they ar» of material dip lomatic Importance, both as comaaitting Ja an to a policy ions advocated by this country and as tending to allay an unreasonable suspi' lon of Japan which has been cherished in main quarters. While the so-culled "adminM entity of China" note which Secretary H*y ad dressed to the powers on July :{. 1900, is an en tireiy analogous case, there are other precedents recorded much earlier i;i tlie history of the countrj . For instance, when the ( layton-Bulwer treaty had been ratified, in 

ISSO, the British Ambassa dor decided that inasmuch as "her majesty's possessions In Honduras had not been explicitly excepted from its provisions, there must be an exchange of diplomatic notes declaring it to li trie understanding of both rnments that such exception was Intended," and the exchange took place before the final exchange of ratifications. There are abundant instances of such exchanges, and of course, the Democrats can", In the esti mation of the Republicans, do nothing more than ialse a dust, the effect of which will be merely to expose their own ignorance. Mr. Bacon's position is likened by some Sen ators to that which he, assumed a year ago with regard to th«s army and navy pay bill. The Sen ator from Georgia reached the highest pitch of indignation over what he tern • executive usur pation when he discovered that the President had authority to adjust the pay table of the non commissioned officers and men of the navy, and it was only after it had been painstakingly pointed out and proven to him that this bad been the law ever since the administration of Presi dent Madison that he was convinced that it was not "a Roosevelt innovation. "' The Investigation of the subject of precedents for the Japanese notes led to the discover that still further negotiations are In progress be tween the Secretary of State and th*' Japanese Ambassador, negotiations which v. ill culminate in a treaty to be submitted to the Senate for it? ratification. This treaty, it is expected will place on the Immigration of Japanese and Amer ican laboring men into the respective countries such limitations as are deemed desirable by both BTOvernm^its. Japan, which is quits as much opposed to the emigration of her subjects as parts of this country are to receiving them, will welcome a final determination of the ques tion by means of a treaty, if such can be so framed as to avoid injuring the pride of the Japanese people and the cordial relations exist ing between the two nations. This is deemed a most opportune time for the perfection of .such a convention. Senators who enjoy the confi dence of the administration are convinced that Secretary Root will succceed in negotiating a treaty which, will be cheerfully ratified by the Senate.

The big ferryboat Mary land, which transfers the Colonial and Federal expresses of the New Haven road from Mott Haven around to the Pennsylvania's tracks in Jersey City, rammed the Anthracite only a few feet off the Battery wall. Without warning one two boats met, and then there was only one. Persons hurrying through Battery Park knew nothing of the fatal accident until they saw harbor craft speeding to the rescue. There were seven men on the Anthracite, the crew of six and Robert W. Morrell. eon of George M. Morrell. president of the George M. Morrell Towing Company, of No. 1 Broadway, which owned the tug-.

Before the Maryland could reverse she had rammed the tug astern on the starboard quarter, ripping her wide open. One moment and the Anthracite had stuck her bow in the air and sunk out of sight, all except the top of her mast and the tip of her black funnel, like a man seized with the cramps.

A unique literary event, th» three hundredth anniversary of Milton's birth, was celebrated to-night in academic style at the theatre in Burlington Garden*. The American Hag was as prominent as the British colors, and the American Ambassador was under it. A large laurel wreath was between the flags, and several portraits of Milton were on the screen. The programme contained a miniature print of a portrait of Milton in bis eleventh year, recently discovered, and now in Passmore Edwards's col lection. The brilliant audience 'n the theatre was en tertahaed with an oration, :i poem and an in formal taik on music. Dr. Ward, master- of Pe terhouse, read a scholarly paper on Mm lines of Milton'- career, laying stress on Its literary rather than political phases. Hi* Vading idea was that Milton ■ * • • me first rate mas ter of the gnnd style of English prose and poetry. George Meredith's poem, splendidly read by the honorary secretary of the academy, was nior. robust and patriotic than the oration, and described Milton as the'defendef of the com monwealth and the chanvptoa of liberty. The comedian of the occasion was sir Fred erick Bridge, who gave, in a most humorous spirit, a running account of "I'omns," and illus tr.it< i) it with the original music of tlie maasjOAj which he had discovered after prolonged r e search There was s small orchestra for the instrumental numbers, and th» madriga ; s and ballads were sunsr « ith reslned taste by members of the choir of Westminator Abbey. <;eorge Meredith's noble ode and th^- archaic music .>f the famous masrjue were the best features of the entertainment.
