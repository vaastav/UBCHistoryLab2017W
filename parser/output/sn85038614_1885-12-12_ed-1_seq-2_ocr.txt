A Strong Oovcrnment. 44 Power is ct*t stealing from the many to the few." The weak party gravitates towards the strong?we lo not say, the weaker to tbe stronger. l*aily we see how the powerful 1 nited States (iovernment draws to itself ad? ditional powers. At least once a year tbe Supreme Court of tbe I nited States reminds us that the State courts have j been dwarfed hy the usurpations of the ; Federal, and that the States once called ?4 sovereign " are now in comparison j with what they were fifty years ago mere provinces?simply counties, aa Patlk K Hknkv predicted. The fiel'l is so large that our vision is not able to extend over all of it, and so we loo often content ourselves with noting what new powers some depart? ment of the Federal (iovernment | ( has usurped which atrect the interests of our own State only. Wo take a deep interest in all the coupon cases from this State which the (nited States Supreme Court decides, and read with surprise and apprehension opinions which set aside the eleventh amendment ns of no force against the encroachments of that tribunal; but we overlook equally important decisions in unset coming from other States and laying down propositions equally as dangerous to the public liberties as those to which we pay so much more attention because they concern Virginia rn a special man? ner. The prohibitory law which was re? cently ratified in Atlanta, (ia., is now in a Federal court. It will not be al? lowed to go into successful operation until lifter it has been adjudged consti? tutional by the Supreme Court of the I'nited States, and therefore never un? less that court shall adjudge it to bc constitutional. A significant condition of things truly in this : but not strange. That court has recently rendel ed seve? ral decisions which may be so inter? preted a* to cast pom* li(iht upon tho line of thought that will probably be followed by that high tribunal when the " vested interests" of the liquor manufacturers of Georgia appeal to it for protection. Last Monday thc Supreme Court of the I'nited States decided several cases from New Orleans which were akin to one another in that they arose under that clause of the Federal Constitution which prohibits a State from passing any law impairing thc obligation of contracts. Head the following : 44 In No. tatt, the New Orleans Water-Works, appellant, te* Robert L* ' Rivers, appellee, a decision was render? ed. The complainant sought to enjoin the appellee from Retting water from the Mississippi river for the usc of Ins house by a lull in equity, claiming thc exclusive right to supply every citizen of the (nited States in New Orleans with water. The demurrer of the de? fendant was sustained by thc Circuit Court, and this decision was today re? versed by the I'nited States Supreme Court.'' That is to say. the Supreme Court ol' the I'nited States af.iru.ed the right of a monopoly to furnish every person in New Orleans with water, lt is stated that this case was decided upon the principles laid down in the Gas-Light Company's cases. And what those principles were the Ficai/itm states as follows : 44 The Court holds that the supplying of gat is a public matter, etc., and that it is proper to give particular corpora? tions exclusive privileges. Legislation of that character, the court says, is not open to the objection that it prevents the citixen from engaging in a business open to all upon terms of equality be? cause such business is a public mattel and may be either a benetlt or an in jury to the public, lt is therefore i proper subject of legislation. 44 The Court recognizes the authority of the State to exercise without inter terence what is known as ? police poa er,' but says this gives it no right t< trench upon the authority of th General Government ur violate right granted or secured by the supreme lai nf the land. 44 In conclusion, the Court says : 1 aa the monopoly clause of the Const tullen indicates to be the judgment i the State, the public interests will I beat subserved by an entire abando anent of the policy of granting e\cl tire privileges to corporations oth tann railroad companied, in couaider lion of services to be performed I them for the public, the way ia open f< the accomplikhmeut of that result wi ie*pect to corporations whose contrec with tnt State are unttfected by th -chang* in the organic law.

The contingency of any at? tack from foreign Powers i? so remote that money spent in meeting it by strengthening our coast defences would appear to be just so much thrown away. Our safety consists not only in our isolated position, our strength, and our wealth, but in the mutual jealously and dislike which foreign nations enter? tain lor each other. Their immense Heels and armaments are kept up, not as a menace to us, but to their neigh? bors. And at what cost* The mind contemplates with sadness the thought that millions of men in Europe, in the primo of life and health, should be taken from their homes and from the peaceful pursuits of industry and kept in enforced idleness and under military restraint, to meet thc contingency of a war which may never come, and which, when it does come, may be unjust and aggressive, and force its adherents to fight in an unholy cause. How must taxation grind the faces of the poor and wring reluctant pennies from thc needy to defray the enormous cost of maintaining and equipping such hosts ! Hut this is not all. The poor con? script is not only taken from home and its endearments and denied his freedom, hut he is kept in a condition of enforced idleness, which blights his moral and intellectual faculties and renders him unfit for the duties of good citizenship abeu his term of enlistment expires. His daily duty is to clean and polish bis gun and equipments and to follow he dull routine of thc drill and manual, uni this for years in succession. Is it my wonder then that he should drink whiskey or eat opium, vices which arc .otorious in garrison life, to rouse the ?luggish brain which has been denied he stimulus of natural and healthy ac? ion 1 It may seem like discussing a very emote question, and one in which we )f this country have very little interest, o enumerate thc evils which are attend int upon the standing armies of Eurone.

X. AiToMA-i"io\ cocNTV, Va.. Decem? ber (,?, lMro. Non-Partisan and Non-Sectional. The Posion Herald says : "Whatever criticism may be made upon the President's message, it nutt be conceded on all hands to be a digni? fied and an entirely non-partisan docu? ment. No one in reading it would Le able to say, from any one of its dis? cussions, whether it was the produc? tion of a Democrat or a Republican." The President's message is a non? partisan document, Dis the document of a statesman. Put we think our Bog lea contemporary is mistaken in saying that no one could tell " whether it was the production of a Democrat or a Re? publican." Where Lt the Republican leader that could write a non-partisan document': Certainly he has never been named in connection with thc presidency. And just herc we would call attention to a very striking poinl thc New Voik Star makes in comment? ing on the message. The Star says : "Asa whole, the message will bi received by the people with approve and by the Democrats of the country with ratisfaction and pride, lt inarki the new era in our history. It show: that the civil war is ended at last, am that the country is in truth at peace t rom the lirst sentence to the final om there is no mention of those difference: which lately involved the land in war and which afterward gave a long life ti hatreds that became a food upon vt hi,! a great party lived." lt is also in order to ask where is th Republican leader that could write non-sectional message } l**ilver and the Democrats. The Atlanta Constitution, a b inctallist of the most decided corni, tions, comments as follows upon tl silver feature of President Clkvi LAMi's message : " Our viewa on this subject are wt understood. We have urged them r peatedly through these t ohitnus. The views have not changed. Put M Cleveland has proved a wise, consis eui, and successful leader. He wroug victory out of defeat in 1894* and we a inclined to believe promises more sure than any other man a surer and broad victory inlM**. While many of his par may disagree with his views on atti coinage, as indeed we do, we doubt if fi tious opposition should be made to t! carrying out of a policy which, wh bo oppose it, has much to commend and has the support of the majoritv the wisest Democratic leaders. V shall offer no captious objections if h views prevail. There is not enough | the silver issue to justify a division the Democratic party, which carries t covenant of honest and non-section and economical government for tb country?not even enough to justify serious entanglement between the par and the mau who led it from a quart of a century of defeat into undisput national v-ctory." lt is centrally believed among t members of Congress. Democrats well as Republicans, that the Admini trallon will be conducted more in i cordalia- with the viewa of Mr. Randi than those of Mr. Carlisle, and that tl foi mer'8 influence is potential at t White House ?

Till' IT. sui. ni iiml -.1 Iv . i To the Editor nf the Dispatch : Nobody doubts the patriotism and honesty of purpose of the President as shown in his neatflfB to Congress, but, like yourself, 1, too, was disappointed with his argument against silver. On reading his message 1 was forcibly struck with the fact that tho figures he gave of tbe "exports and imports" were in direct opposition with his linc of remarks on silver. Now, if gold is the money of the nations we trade with, it would appear that last year we gained of that sort of money |10a^600,702.o*), for our exports of merchandise were that amount greater than our imports. With that fact admitted it does not look as if the time will soon come when we will have to export gold to pay the balance of trade against us with foreign nations. Worse still for his argument for we absolutely eaported |17,atyS,? OM more of silver than we import? ed. Last and still worse for his argument against silver, we (that is the I'nited State*) imported *lr*.'J13,Mi4 more of gold than we exported. So it would seem that six years (at least) after the coinage of two million of silver per month thc ie balance of trade last year was ovei j, one hundred and sixty-two million dol? lars in our favor (due in gold from Mr Cleveland's standpoint), and that wi besides imported over eighteen mil lions of dollars in gold over and abovi what we exported. Those two stub born facts taken from the figures fur Dished by thc President do not seen to me to be a good sort of foundttior to build tn irizument against silve money upon, and especially when it i: also shown by figures, furnished also b; bim, that our exports of silver weri seventeen million over and above on imports. To sum up, we gained largel; in gold and lost considerably in silver Kacts of that sort, if kept an, wouh bring about exactly what 1 think th President would like to see?to-wit very much more gold in the I'nitei States and less silver.

I'". V un ni or I'roli ss|,,? ,| Inkers. |Bew York World.) The suit ol' Benjamin B. Vallentine managing editor of Texas Si/tings against Henry C. Bunner, editor o Puck; was decided yesterday by a ver diet of the jury in his favor fm |1,0 'iT.i'iO. The case was a peculiai one. Mr. Vallentine had been on term! of great personal intimacy with Bun ner for the many years that they hat worked side by side in the office of Puck \ allentine was connected with the pa per from the time of its inception, ami Bunner joined it shortly after. They began by working for nominal salaries but were assured that in case the papei became a success they would be reward ed with an interest in it. Every ono in a while one of them would go to Mr Adolph Scbwartzmann, the busines maniger and one of the proprietors who would renew his promise* am generally make some small increase ii their salary, but never to any aatisfacto ry extent. Neither of the humorists got alon| very well with Mr. Schwartzmann Bunner was barely on speaking term: with him, and Vallentine was not evet so friendly as that, and never spoke tc bim unless obliged to do so upon som matter of business. After having die cussed the situation time and time agaii between themselves, both hating to gi to the proprietors, Bunner and Vallen tine consulted a lawyer to determini what methods they should adopt to ge the desired advancement, lt was decided according to Valentine's story, that i would bi poor policy fut both to appl. at once, aa Mr. 8chwarUrnann might get sagry ?nd discharge both; ao they arranged that Dunner should go first, because he was not in a state of actual hostility to Schwartr.mann. Bannar then told his friend that if he was m.de a partner he would exert his influence in his friend's behalf, and until the latter was also admitted into the firm would share with him what? ever ha got beyond the salary he was then receiving. Once admitted into an interest in the paper. Runner's friend? ship cooled down, and not long after Vallentine wu discharged. Runner de? nied that he had agreed to divide what? ever he received from Mr. Schwart/. mann, but admitted the rest of the story. Vallentine's assertion that his former friend had received $1,000 in cash was totally denied. "I never heard of tito $1,000 until I came to court," said bc, " nor did I ever hear anything about a division of what I had got. Certainly Mr. Val? lentine never asked me to give him any ol' it. 1 constantly mat'c him small loans, but that was all." The defence wanted to make it appear that tho suit was a malicious ..nc, brought by Vallentine as the editor ol an opposition comic paper to have tho circulation ol Puck made public, so a* lo annoy the owners. A letter ol' Mr. Vallentine's to a brother humorist, telling him that thc suit would make fun for the advertisers, was brought up in court and admitted as evidence. Valentine had arranged to be given an interest when the circulation reached a certain point, but was discharged be? fore it did so regularly, thou ga thc figure specified, 60,000 copies weekly, wts exceeded during the campaign just before his dismissal. He is bringing a suit for 11*0*000 against the owners of Puck. _ HE GOT EVEN. Iliiiiiinit Hutt li mid Mlllnir Tltr-r Vim lilia Tliou.hl 1 liri Hail Taken Hit l.lle. A Frankfort (Ky.) special says : About two weeks ago the barofact that Frank Sanders had been shot down in the mountain wilds of Whitley county was learned here from citizens coming from that section. A gentleman that lives here has just returned from a visit to Whitley county, and he brings news of the romance of which the killing was the finale. He says that the tra? dition in Whitley is that just before thc dose of the war Sanders and two other men, all of whom were member.' of a guerilla band, took a man named Sam, Smock into the woutis in the eastern part of the county anti pot l pistol between his eyes and tired. Smock fell and they left him for dead. Fortunately for Sam. the ball ranged downward, missing thc brain, and came out at the base of his neck. He was found and card tor by friends, ami after long nursing recovered. The men who attempted thc murder did not try to conceal their identity fruin Smock, in fact they wanted him to know then. They felt secure in tho faith that "dead iinti tell no tales." After Snoek's recovery he registered an oath dat he would devote hi* life to hunting down and killing these three men. A few wicks ago he pessed through Wayne county, and. in conver i-ation with Otteof lu- old friends, said I ?? I have killed two of thc tuen who at? tempted to murder me years ago.

Om- week later the body of Frank Sanders was found in a lonely path in thc glens of Whitley county, with the following note BCfihbled ta pen il and pinned to his coat : M This is thc last act of a tragedy begun years ago."

But ther was barely room for the rabbit, and th hound was caught between the crotc and badly injured. The rabbit turne and looked athis enemy a minute, an was soon lost in the thicket.

Comptroller Cannon, en-officio commis? sioner of thc Freedman's Savings and Trust Company, has made a report to Congress in regard to the affairs of that institution, from which it appears that the total payments made to the credi? tors ol tbe company aggregate $1,7'JD, 780, leaving to be paid under the pro? visions of thc act of February 17, I***.!, thc sum of ?8,52G. Thc commissioner renews his recommendation for rdiel by Congress of the unfortunate credi? tors ol the institution, snd adds: '? A great majority of them are of the poorest and most illiterate of our people. Many of them have grown old and decrepit. It seems impossible for thc-e people to realize that they arc to be deprived of. or have lost, a portion of their earnings which years ago they labored so hard to acquire and save. Thousands of then) to this day believe that the dividends paid them by thc commissioner are but interest on or earnings of their deposits, and that soon? er or later their original deposits will bc returned to them. No explanation seems to convince them to tho con? trary, and calls arc made daily, both orally and in writing, for '? their money." Nor ought it to be considered strange or unreasonable in view of all thc circumstances for those people to look to thc Government for reimbursement of their losses. The company was chartered by Congress for their special benefit to encourage in? dustry and thrift, and'most of Hs branches were presided over by com? missioned and uniformed ofllcera of tho Government. It was but natural, there? fore, for them to assume that the ?iov? ernment would sec to the proper man? agement of thc institution and would protect them from loss. Objection has been made to thc granting of this relief on the ground of its dangerous tendency as a precedent. This appre? hension I think ia groundless. There never wa* but ono Freedman's Rank : there will never be another. From the gradual diminution of the amount called for on account of the several dividends declared, it is estimated that thc sum of 1080,000 would covr the deficiency between the amount paid (62 per cent. and the amount to which creditors like? ly to call for the same were entitled at t he time of the failure of thc com? pany." Th* commissioner submits a bill de* signed to acioinpli*h the desired relief, ami says that if the relief is granted provision should be made for the tram* fer to the Patted states of the t (Bain? ing assets of the company, a* it i* probable that a considerable sum tiny set bc reali/ed from the a*s(.;s, dow regarded a* of but little or no value.
