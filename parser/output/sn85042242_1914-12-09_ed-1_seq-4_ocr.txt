One of the outstanding features of President Wilson's message to Con­ gress is the absence of any reference to legislation touching business. The Democratic party leaders are siware that this is no time to push further their program of trust legislation. There is little unusual in the mes­ sage. It touches specifically upon few points. There is no reference to the Mexican, situation, the administration is evidently willing to consider inter­ vention there a closed incident. 'President Wilson is right in urg­ ing the passage of legislation which will permit the creation of a mer­ chant marine through federal aid. He makes it plain that the entry of the government into this Held of action will be merely temporary and when private capital is attracted, the gov­ ernment should withdraw. The chief executive shows that his sympathies do not lie on the side of big armaments, great national de­ fenses and a large standing army. On this point he says: "We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals -we never shall have a large standing army." 'He advocates, however, military training, but makes no specific recom­ mendations as to extending the vol­ unteer service. But many will hardly agree with the following, in view of the plight in which all Europe finds herself: "But I turn away from the sub­ ject. It i3 uot new. There is no new need to discuss it. We shall not alter our attitude toward it because some amongst us are nervous and excited. We shall easily and sensibly agree upon a policy of defense. The ques­ tion has uot changed its aspects be­ cause the times are not normal. Our policy will not toe for an occasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing, which we will pursue at all seasons, without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the world, the abiding friendship of states, and the unham­ pered freedom of all with whom we deal. Let there be no misconception. The country has been misinformed. We have not beeu negligent of na­ tional defense. We are not unmind­ ful of the great responsibility resting upon us. Wfe shall learn and profit by the lesson of every experience and every new circumstance and what is needed will ibe adequately done." Aside from the merits of the issue, t}ie Germans to date have .put up the b^st fight. Tlie victory at Lodz will gm down in military annals. Sfameone should open a relief fund for the unfortunate 'bystander at! faomfe. Eastern reports show that tile associations are liard push­ ed td care for the poor within our own aomain. 

BABIES AND HOGS. Recently a country newspaper an niMiiiced that 3,047 hogs had been lost from cholera and placed their value at $29,855. In the same couuty during that period, 7-1 babies died of cholera Infantum. Their value was estimated in economic figures as being $148,000. While tho comparison was merely arbitrary and done to show the economic waste caused even when himians die, the paper which publish­ ed the hog loss refused to give tlio baby item any publicity. JIow to prevent infant mortality is becoming more and more a serious study in the different communities. Tho science of child welfare is being placed upon a practical basis, and few communities now are as far 'be­ hind as that one whicli seemed to think loss from hog cholera of great­ er news value than the loss of babies through an epidemic. There is great room for improve meat yet. In many localities the dis eases of animals receivo more atten tion from state and federal officials than tho various ills^ which claim thousands as their victims among hu man beings. When a baby pig dies, tife farmer realizes that the death represents a money loss and that, the death should have been prevented. While grief and a sense of loss is more potent when a child dies, the economic waste is not considered. The death is viewed largely from the sentimental side. But there is a great economic waste there and some organization similar to that which stamps out epidemics among animals under the stimulus of federal and state support should also safeguard the health of the men, wom­ en and children. •Local health boards and states are doing much, but a federal health board is necessary just as a federal animal husbandry department is vital lo the agricultural growth of the na­ tion. PERSONAL EFFICIENCY. And now, after we have organized our establishment, and systcmatizeC our work and card-indexed our time} and reduced our motions to their low­ est terms, we come to the most diltl eult matter of all, the Question of tho efficiency of the individual. Is the reader doing as "well by himself as he is by his business? Is lie as success­ ful in attaining the aims that lie thinks most desirable, whatever these may be, as lie is in achieving the ends of his profession? Is he making as much out. of life as lie ought to make? Let us, in accordance with the spirit of the time refer the ques lion to an expert, the iinost expert of modern analysts of tho human mind, Professor William .lames. In his soul stirring essay on "The Energies of Man," lie says: "The human individual lives usual­ ly far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sort which lie habi­ tually fail lo use. We energizes be­ low his maximum and he behaves be­ low his optimum, Compared with what we ought, to be, we are only half awake. Our llres are damped, our drafts are checked. We are mak­ ing use of only a small part of our possible 'mental and physical resourc­ es." In this expert opinion we would all concur from our own experience. But, when Ave pass from diagnosis to rem­ edy it is found, as usual, that doctors disagree. How can we tap these un­ utilized reservoirs of power and emo­ tion that we feel within U3? Profes­ sor James says by prayer. Professor Chittenden says by fasting he would have us cut down our calories and protein by half. Mr. 'Edison would cut down our sleep by half three or four hours every day or so when we have nothing else to do. Heart and lungs never sleep why need hands and brain? Perhaps we do eat and sleep too much, though personally Ave are some- what skeptical of the desirability of much curtailment of the restorative functions of the body. But at least we ought to see to it that we eat and sleep efficiently, that we do not cheat our stomachs to please our palates, and do not dawdle away our bedtime. Listening to the clock strike at night is as lazy habit as watching it in busi­ ness hours. And when Ave go in for pleasure purely we should look out that we get the worth of our time and money. We ought not to waste OUT* playtime in doing anything .less than what we most delight in doing so far as that is attainable. This also Is an essential part of the efficient life. Farmers in Morton county are now busy hauling grain Avhich is being marketed at a strong price. Thresh­ ing: activities continue on several farms but this work generally is over.

Tokio, Dec. 8.—Big business inter­ ests of apan, some of which have op­ posed from the start the participation of Japan in the war, are Avondering how Japan will be able to borrow needed money from now on. "The war may be necessary for Japan from a political and ethical standpoint," said a prominent banker to the cor­ respondent of the Associated iPress, "but I wonder if it will ibe a good thing for business. Moreover, I think it will be impossible for Japan to bor­ row money in Europe Avitliin the® fl«re or seven years following the close of the war." Japan, he continued, desired to go on with her work of commercial and financial development. The European money market being closed, bankers 'were, asking themselves whether it would be possible to secure loans in the United States. The ibusiness in­ terests were anxious to create closer and more extensive business relations With the United States and to make the Pacific ocean a sphere not only of peace but of greater commercial activity. It was evident, he said, thai there existed, in Japan today a power­ ful current of opinion in this direction which was opposed to any considera­ tion of local political party strife in­ terfering Avitli such a trade and com­ mercial development. Tajiri Writes. Viscount Inajiro Tajiri, president o£ the board of auditors, who studied economics and finance at "Yale univer­ sity, has written this month about the fundamental solution of Japanese fin­ ance, which he considered the tmost difficult problem that Japan has to face. In Japan, it was perhaps, more difficult than ia any other country iu the world and yet there was no coun­ try on earth where there Avas such hope for the future, if all -classes con­ tinued to co-operate toward the one end of financial consolidation. He Avrote: "The question that most vitally af­ fects national finance in this country is that of food. Itis, in fact, the great fundamental problem of the na­ tion. Solve this problem and thc problem of finance *s solved. iAt pres­ ent our food supply is deficient anc renders us a debtor nation.
