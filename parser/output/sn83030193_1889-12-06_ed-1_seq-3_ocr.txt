Judge Lawrence I yesterday refused to vacate the order of arrest ogalnst that liberally feed interme- 1 diary between the Oystcrmcn and the Dock I Commission. B Mr. Ikoallb has introduced in the Sen- II ate a bill providing for a World's Fair and authorizing the Government, through a : Board of Commissioners, to expend five million dollars in securing a site and pro I vidiug buildings. It it evident that Mr. j Inoalls Is anxious to have the Fair held I in Washington City. I Despatches from TnoviAs Stevens, The Wom.D'3 commissioner, confirm the early report that he was the first representative I of Journalism to welcome Stanley back I to civilization. Mr. Stevens has been stricken down witli fever, and a despatch from Zanzibar announces that Euin Pahiia has met with a probably fatal accident. It is proposed by the French Republic to send a friendly war-ship to Brazil to greet the rising star of the Republic, aud a Paris . newhpaper objects on the ground that the presence of such u vessel at Rio would be regarded as a, menace to the Republic? This ltlen is so novel and stupid that wo hud supposed that It had been copyrighted by the Philadelphia Prm. Jav Gould Imagines that as the Elevated Railway King of this city he is rendering services which lire not appreciated. Ho wants more privileges. At the same time he prefers Chicago or St. Louis to New York as a location for the World's Fair. By all menus let's turn in and help Jat to grow richer. As the city's benefactor he should not bo permitted to languish. XF The President of the Union Dredging Company yesterday bluntly traversed Capt. MoM aiion's testimony regarding the alleged dredging robberies and frauds. But may not Mr. Loomis have forgotten all about it, just as he forgot all about tuo othp busi ness of the Dredging Company ? Can any one believe a statement from a man who owns such a lamentably weak and treach erous memory? Benator Plait succeeds Ex - Senator Cbaoe as manager ot the International Copyright Bill, which was introduced on Wednesday. It is substantially the same a measure that passed the Senate in the last IT Congress, and that would have passed the 1 House of Representative, if Mr. Patson I had not filibustered against the transaction I of any business on the day on which it I I ought to have come up. All who are con- cerned in the making of books, authors, printers and publishers favor the bill, and M It ought to pass before tho end of the session. I It Is claimed by the Chicago Herald that New York City Is daily menaced by a yel- low.fever epidemic, despite the fact that 'ar yellw fever lins not disturbed a city in W this latitude for forty years. It also dwells 1 tiDon our terrible death-deallnt; electric I wtrei as though there were no wires In Chi. cago to kill people, and adds t " It is this city, with death-traps placod along the streets, which Is asking the world to come and visit It. It Is the Invitation of the spider to the fly." And yet two whiffs of the Chicago River on a hot day carry more menace to human life than all the electric wires In New York City. By the way, these wires will all be snugly interred before 1802. A terrible scandal has been brought upon the Democratic administration of the late House of Representatives by tho theft of $72,000 of Government funds by Chaven E. Silcott, cashier of Sergeant-at-Arras Leedom. In addition to this sum stolen from the treasury of the House Siloott is understood to have appropriated $10,000 or $20,000 of funds deposited with the Ser-geant-at-Artns by members. Mr. Leedom engaged Siloott when he first took tho offlco of Sergcant-at-Arms, some six years ago. They were both from Adams County, Ohio. They had been reared together. Siloott'b antecedents were excellent, but tho temptation of Washington proved too much for him. It is supposed that he has taUen refuge in Canada, together with the woman who was mainly instrumental in causing his downfall. BO WE 

WAHT THE PAIB? Thcro is no uso in asking Congress to give the World's Fair to Now York. Congress will givo New York nothing which It can withhold. It Is ldlo to demonstrate to Congress the manifest propriety of locating the Fair here and the absurd Impropriety of placing it in any provincial town. Congress already knows all that can bo said on that point and is not In the least concerned to observo tho proprieties of the case. If New York wants the Fair New York must pay for it. If any appeal from New York is to be effective it must bo sup ported by a money demonstration of its earnestness. It Is not arguments that are lacking in New York's case, but money. It Is not a failure of intelligence that btands in our way, but tho miserable stinginess of the rich men who have subscribed nothing and the narrow stupidity of the Finance Com mittee in fixing upon an inadequate sum for tho Guarantee Fund. If we go before Congress with a miser able $5,000,000 guarantee and a petition tho paltry sum will be mocked at as a proof of the city's unworthlness and tho petition scorned as a beggar's plea. If we are to succeed we must go to Con gress with ten or twenty millions in hand and say that New York 1, ready to pay the expenses of a great World's Fair in cele bration of the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America, and ask Con gress to give formal sanction to the enter prise as National in character. Are we ready to do that ? If so we must put up the monoy. If not we shall save ourselves trouble and humiliation by with drawing from the contest. MB. WIMDOM'B PLAH. In his annual report Mr. Windom con siders each of the proposed plans for solv ing the silver question and shows each to bo unwise and impracticable. He then offers a plan of his own which is more unwise and more impracticable than any of them. Here Is his statement of the plan: Iisue Treimry notes agalnit depoilti of illrtr ball. Ion at the market price of lilYer wlitn drpoalted, payable on demand In such quantities of silver bull ion as nlll equal In valuo at the date of presentation the number of dollars expressed on the fare of the nolis at the market price of silver, or In fold, at the option of the Goernment, or in silver dollars, at tho option of the holder. Ileical the compulsory fea tures of the preient Colnaire aot. Under this plan there will bo a totally new kind of money put Into circulation a fonn of Treasury notes of uncertain and fluctuating value, legal tender for some purposes but not for others, redeemable but upon uncertain and variable terms, and wholly unlimited In amount. The owner of silver bullion Is to bo allowed to compel the Government to buy it at the market price, whether the Gov ernment wants it or not. He can deposit the metal aud draw it out on a purely gambling basis. If tho price falls after a deposit he can demand and get a larger amount of silver than he deposited; if the price recovers he can deposit again at the higher rate, making the difference while the Government loses It. The thing resembles bettiug at roulette much more closely than it resembles serious finance. But if silver rises after a deposit the thrifty depositor Is under no obligation to accept a less amount of it in exchange for his certificates than he put in. He has the option either to pass the certificates upon the Government at their face value in pay ment of taxes, or to demand their redemp tion in silver dollars of full legal-tender character. In that event the Government has the consolation of knowing that it can pay in gold dollars instead, if it is so minded. Tho proposal Is not worthy of serious consideration. It is not finance at all ; it is politics. It does not solve the question of tho use- of silver as money, or attempt to solve it. It merely shirks it in tho hope of satisfying the silver-producers without offending the mono-metallists. It will not satisfy tho one or please the other. ODMTJIiATlVE ETIOrBOH, Engineer Gbeenb, of the Dock Depart ment, was under examination yesterday. He was very anxious, be said, to have all his bank accounts examined and he seemed a trifle too sensltlvo in resenting what he called charges of corruption made against him. But Corporation Counsel Clark very quietly remarked that he had not yet heard any one charge Mr. Giucene with corruption, and the Commissioners of Accounts 'informed the Chief Engineer that the most Important part of the case had not yet been touched and that he would be wanted again. It appeared from Mr. Gbbeni's admis sions that the Union Dredging Company had done unauthorized work, and that to cover it up the same work had been ad vertised to be lot, so that the Company might get the job which they had already done. If any other Company had bid lower than tho Union, Engineer Gueene supposed that he would have found some other work for it to do. Docs this seem an honest method of managing public business f Mr. Greene confirmed the stories of the loose and profligate manner in which the supplies of tho Department wcro parcelled out to " Invited " bidders. He " did not believe" Capt. McMaiion's stories about the dredging frauds, and ho " did not bc llcvo " that Gardinibr, tho Inspector of dredged material, wub paid by the Dredg ing Company, although he wbb formerly In tho Company's employ. Gaudinieii, he admitted, was appointed at the Instance of Ex-Speaker James W. Husted. Scratch a suspected Dock employee and you find a Republican Senator or Assemblyman uu deincath. Engineer Greene's evidence will confirm tho belief that the Dork Department is putrid with mismanagement, irregularity, Irresponsibility and corruption. 18 IT 

SAFE OE0UKD7 In his desire to win the approval of all the Republicans In the country Mr. Har rison has made the mistake of taking the Chicago platform seriously and imagining that the Republican party in power is as harmonious as tho Republican party out of power was in supporting the prepos terous declarations of that document. He says, for examplo, that In legislating on tho tariff " the protective principle should be maintained and fairly applied to the products of our farms as well as of our shops." That means tho increaso asked for by tho wool men in the duty on wool. But the constituencies of a good many New England members of Congress want free wool, and will certainly never consent to an Increase In tho tax on that raw material. Again, the utterance means uncompro mising hostility to any reduction of duties on those necessaries of life which are tbo "products of our shops." But a largo proportion of tho Republicans of tho Northwest insist upon some relief In that direction. Their representatives were dragooned with a single exception into opposition to the Mills Bill j they wero impressed with the necessity of party harmony and they knew that the bill could In no case pass the Senate. But it will be quite another I thing to whip them into the support of the policy of taxing necessaries now that their party Is in power In both houses and their votes are determinative of actual legislation. Apparently Mr. Harbison has not been as successful In his search for perfectly safe ground as a President desirous of " pleasing himself " with a second term may be presumed to wish. EMIHEirXLY FIT. The selection of C. C. Harrison for the Russian mission ought to surprise nobody. Mr. Harrison is not a statesman nor a diplomatist. He Is not a man known to the public for ability of any kind. He has had no experience in duties of the kind which fit one for such a position. He is wholly destitute of the qualifications com monly accounted essential in such cases. But he is a millionaire. Ho represents the only class which this Administration holds in high recard. He is reputed to have been a liberal subscriber to the corruption fund collection with which John Wana maeeu bought his place in the Cabinet. He is a member of the Sugar Trust, and as such represents tho plutocratic, monopo listic constituency which put Mr. Harrison into office and his party Into control of Congress, with n hundred thousand major ity of votes against both. He Is one of the beneficiaries of Protec tion. Ho is a member of the class which aspires to become dominant in this coun try and is willing to purchase and pay for political supremacy. He has all the quali fications which are most regarded at present by the Republican party and its President. His appointment is quite in the natural order of things. 

WEOHQIHO THE PHEBIDEHT. The St. Paul 1'ioneer Prat, the leading Republican newspaper of the Northwest, says of tho Blair education scheme that " nobody believes in it but a few senti mentalists and surplus-killers. The bill for Federal aid to education ought not to be able again to secure tho voles of a dozen members of either house." The Hartford Courant, a leading Repub lican newspaper of New England, owned and edited by a Republican Senator, com menting upon President Harrison's ap proval of the scheme In his Message, says : " It Is to be regretted that the Message in dorses the plan of the Blair Bill. This ac tion is no doubt largely duo to the Presi dent's position when he was a Senator. But It is none the less an error of judgment, and it comes at a time when public opinion has sol decidedly more strongly against the policy." Now, all this Is cruelly unjust to Mr. Harrison. In his bucolic innocence tho President assumed that the platform adopted by his party, on which ho was elected, meant something. He supposed that It was a fairly candid expression of the party's opinions and Intentions, and with a docilo desire to recommend pre cisely what the party wanted him to recommend he paraphrased the platform and colled the result his Message. In the platform h.e found a flat-footed fr'ni iyiaV It .aytfais.iftat iSaltilBpviWtiIsi nk'iw i declaration that " the State or nation, or both combined, should support free Institu tions of learning sufficient to afford to every child growing up in the land the opportunity of a good common sohool education." How could Mr. Harrison know that the platform was fol de rol r How could he tell that his party was only shamming when it put forward this declaration? The man Is distinctly Ill-treated. 

TIME FOB BOLID fiE8ULTS What does the Pan-American Congress proposo to do, anyhow ? It has enjoyed n pleasant junketim; tour through this country, it intends to spend a few joyous days in New York this month and hopes to add to its happiness by an expedition into tho inspiring limits of Brooklyn. But as a deliberative body what has It dono to add to the neighborly feeling of the American Republics ? Surely weeks spent In perfecting certain rules of debate aud quieting the impetuosity of Scnor Quis tana, of the Aigentlne Republic, are not valuablo additions to the progressive ten dencies of the New World. The United States Government has spent considerable money hi making tho Pmi Amcrican Congress a possibility. Tho time has come for tho people of this country, who ultimately pay for this deliberative luxury, to ask for some useful outcome iu exchange for the expenditure involved. As the metropolis of the American Con tinent New York will extend a warm welcome to the Pan-Americans. But we reserve the right to aBk for some practical result from an assemblage bearing in its very namo the essenco of New World aspirations. Let the Pan-American Congress abandon its secrecy, its inclination to split parlia mentary hairs and its aping of Europeau conferences. What we need in this case, to take an Illustration from Dioebnb, 1b not a Circumlocution Office but a Gradgrlnd school of facts. 00B DUTY TO BEPUBLIC8. The Beaver Falls (Pa.) Tribune needs some elementary instruction. It says : Tin Would commends lo Mr. DLiinit, as an exam ple worthy of Imitation, the promptness with which Mr. 1'iBii through minister SrcKLis recoiridaed the Republic of Spain, In February, 1K7D but we are suprlsed that any man who thinks himself competent to edit a great metropolitan dally would expect or ask Mr. Blaike to repeat the hasty and foollih farce in which Mr, Fish, Mr. Sickles afid the United States Congress were the leading characters in tLe early months of 1H73. Where Is the Republic of Spain now 1 How lone did It endure f Have we any assurance that the Republic of Brail will last so Ions or Is any less a mythf But what has that to do with the matter? Do you Imagine that we guarantee the per maueuce of every government we recog nize ? Can you not see that Spain's relapse into the barbarism of kingly rule in no way lessened tho value of our prompt expression of our readiness to rejoice in her emanci pation? The American people believe in the eternal righteousness of donocratlc in stitutions. It Is the business of their Gov ernment to rctlcct their convictions In their dealings with other nations. All people who try to free themselves from their mas ters and to establish a Republic look to the Great Republic for the help of prompt and cordial sympathy. Brazil had a right to expect a glad wel come at our hands, and If our Government had been in tho control of men Imbued wilh the American spirit her expectation would not have been disappointed. Three notorious dives in the city, all having liquor licenses, wero visited by Would reporters a week ago last Sunday morning. The affidavits of the reporters show that they were admitted to these resorts after 1 o'clock in the morning and were drugged while there. The fact that the dives were illegally open at that hour on Sunday, thus doubly violating tho law, was established. Some of tho bartenders and proprietors have since been arrested by the police and held for trial. Tho Excise Commissioners now huve an opportunity of proving their de termination to enforce the law by revoking the licenses of these thrco dives. They arc ail disreputable dens and they ought to be closed. If their licenses are revoked thoy can and will be closed by the police. President Me a kin and Com missioners FiTzi'ATitioK aud Koon havo greatly improved the exciso administration iu tho city. They should lose no time in doing a plain act of justico in this matter, and in revoking the licenses which have been forfeited by such gross violations of the law. In an Interview in an evening newspaper Jay Gould refers to a decision by Judge Brewer, the new Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, sustaining tho pica on which he hopes to defeat in tho courts the action of Postmaster-General Wanamakeu in fixing the telegraphic rate for Govern ment messages at one mill per word. Judge Brewer, in a recent railroad case in the United States Circuit Court, decided against the right of the Government to exact ser vice which entails loss on the corporation rendering it. According to Jat Gould, Judgo Brewer held that such an exaction was hi effect confiscation and thus in conflict with the Constitution. As Goui.u inlendB to light the Postmaster-General's order in the courts the advancement of Judge Brewer to tho Supreme Court Is of interest to him at this time. Senator Vance's bill for tho repeal of the Civil-Service Law is not Democratic, and its author is worthy of the se verest condemnation. The law has oper ated to the advantage of the Govern ment and has developed to its present excellence by a Democratic President. There Is some hope felt, mainly by Rcp'ub. licans, that under this Administration the law may be repealed. No one could have expected such a result while Mr. Cleve- VjAkiV ' - !A"tAa'.A.l hJ.JA . V ' ,.X j,!! . like, i . a. ' land was President. Under the circum stances a Democratic Senator has no excuse for attacking the system. More over, the law Is a fixed fact nd Its only bad feature Is Its Improper enforcement. Hbnrt Carlton, tho slayer ot Policeman Brbnnan, wan executed In an expert man ner yesterday. The affair was well man aged, and all accounts agree that a human life could not have been more neatly taken by electricity. This permits tho gallows to retire with credit, inasmuch, if the electrical capital punishment law stands, Carlton's gallows will be the last ever erected in the Tombs. After Carlton's death yesterday, far the first time In twenty years, thcro was not a single condemned murderer In the Tombs. Senator Blair's fertile mind Is still active. Ho now wants the District of Columbia represented In Congress and In tho Electoral College. Ho presented a bill yesterday proposing an amendment to the Constitu tion so thut tho District shall be entitled to representation in Congress by one Senator and ono Representative, and that it shall ulfo lie entitled to us many electors for President and Vice-President as it lias members in Congress. Thcro is no greater anomaly In tho public service than tho presence of tho Weather Bureau in the Army. Forecasting storms and transmitting mcsMigcs by Hag aud torch aro entirely dissimilar occupations. The conjunction of tho two has proved a failure. As a rulo culUted men cannot be come meteorologists, and the reward of a second lieutenancy is not adequate for one who can aud does. Mrs. Uackat. wife- of the Donsnza. Kins, has virtually won her libel suit acainit the Man cheater (Emrland) Rzamtner. For the pnrpone of annoying anil vexing Mrs. Macxat the Examiner repeated tho story that she had at one tlmo performed tls functions of a washer woman hi Nevada. Tho puullihers have apolo Bired to Mrs. MAOXAT.and in addition to paying all costs of tho action have agreed to pay a cer tain sum to a charitable institution to lie selected by the plaintiff. This will probably put a stop to tho slanders about Mrs. Macxat in English newspapers, which are understood to be paid for by certain of her aooial enemies.
