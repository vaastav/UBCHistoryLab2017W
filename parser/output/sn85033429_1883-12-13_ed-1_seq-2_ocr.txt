Tlr-. lSrownlow am' the Kace - tfor Vongrcss.'- ThA ram ' and radiant idiot who editavtho compound of drivel and .poUmetal r known - as the Knoxville Daily Tribune thinks he knows a thing or i two about Frsfc District ' politics, when it would put an unbearable pressure onhikjittle knot to know anything about his own district. iJoYthis Is' always the way with these fools. ' T.Knowing nothing theirY absurdfr vanity , - leads them! to 'believe tbe.t know all When it comes to mounting a dashing charger, , , like gallant knight of yore, and; dressing like a modern clown in chromatic calico and glittering tin, bean pole in hand, dashing at a deadly bafrekhop'hung in mid-air why, in that 'field we 'are prepared to concede, that, the. editor of the T.i b n d is as : -. . much at Jhome as any other ass of equal cerebral accommodations for small affairs l- .r. ;;1;,,'-.1 - V We aref;j likewise, prepared to admit that when it comes to stalk ing out' Irdm a' concealed place, with a deadly" weapon in band, and ruthlessly burning a fellows citizen's chin whisker, with pow der why, there, too, is our idiot orial contemporary on his native heath, th master of all he sur veys with the assassin's heart and "STnerveless aim. ; . He's a daisy, and don't yonfor get it,'in these walks of life.. Ilis manners, don't- indicate . that he has grown up in the best circles, and : his malicious detraction of better men than himself does not do much credit to what little brain and principle ho may have among other private chattels; still, he is jasfc too sweet for anything.' One of his recent pleasantries was to picture-all the promineut republicans of this district at Mr. Hook's feet, suppliants for pat ronage,, and. that gentleman's favor for the . nomination next summer! '' If '' the editor of the Tribune wanted to raise a laugh he certainly succeeded in this at his own expense. Probably his success in this line encouraged him to persevere, for he followed . it by the start ling statement that Mr.Brownlow was after Maj. Pettibone's scalp; that he was the creature ot Pet- tibone, and wound up with the courteous and dignified reflection, Of sich is the: honor and gratis tude of thieves!"' Possibly it would be wasted ad vice to caution the editor, of tho Tribune that politics gives to blackguards no authority to aps proach gentlemen or to touch the names of - their superiors. The tomtit ' of -the Tribune possibly does not know, that he is a liar End a blackguard, as well as an ' assassin and a fool, hut if he re riuires to be informed on that point we herewith tender him the 6tubbbrn'"fhing a fact in plain English. Mr. Brown low is not a candi date for congress. To Maj. Pet tibolie he owes the obligations which friend owes to friend no more, no less. , Had he any am bition to go to Congress, there is an open field and a ' fair prospect. He desires only to pursue his for-, tunes in legitimate business outs side of politics, and he will remain as hi has ever been, a gentleman, an honest man, and the superior in every way of such small, spiteful fellows as the editor ot the Knox ville Tribune. Should the republicans select Maj. Petti bone to represent them in the next congress he will be warmly supported l.y Mr. lirown low, both as a friend and a repub lican; should they select another Mr. Taylor, Judge Butler, Chan cellor Smith,- Col. Reeves, Gen. Fain, Col. A. J. Brown. ,khu Sim erly, Brnce Bachmau, A. I). Wil son, or any other republican, lie will do his utmost to secure the election of the nominee, and do it heartily- He is under no obliga tions f iot" trratituJe for favors j done or promised to any man. Prom no one has he received fa vors in excess of favors extended by himself, and it is time this ly ing about his "ingratitude" had ceased. The man who represents Mr. Brownlow as guilty of ingrat- itude or dishonor in any respect is a liar and a slanderer. The President's Message. The President's - message is strictly a report of national bus ness to congress, presented in the plainest English, and to the cas ual reader it will doubtless be more noticeable for its lack of personal recommendations than anything else. Our foreign relations are : Bet forth minutely and in view of the decayed state of our commerce,and our domestic peace and prosperity, we know of nothing which has more demands on the president and law-makers than the status of our commercial and : diplomatic relations with foreign powers. Our own unwise laws have doubtless contributed very materially to the decadence of our shipping, but so long as English and Dutch , goods are admitted to foreign ports on more favorable terms than our own, and while some of our pro ducts, as prepared swine in Ger many, are positively excluded, the whole fault cannot bo laid at the door of our shipping laws, aad a field in vpen for diplomatid medi- In evidence of the fact that Mr. Arthur's administration, has been both busy and successful in its foreign work, it is shown that France has raised the embargo from American pork; consular aud commercial treaties have been ef fected with the Danubian pnncis palities, and with Corea and Mad agascar, while a hope is held out that the damaging restrictions on our commerce with Cuba and Porto Eico will be modified. Among the suggestions is a fisheries commission, to, foster our Atlantic and Pacific fish com merce, interests and rights. t ; While he has no doubts that the revenues might be further re duced, the President' says .thit legislation in that 'direction, rat the present session of congresSiis not deemed advisable for the rea son that a sufficient time has not elapsed since; the last . reductions to make certainties of the' present estimates! and he suggests that a portion, at least,' of the surplus may be applied' with benefit 'to the country to the rehabilitation of our navy.' ..." ' -' ' r(.' ..J -V v The President does not favor the downright absorption of the telegraph business of the country by the governmen f, ,but j favors government supervision . of . inter? state telegraph business.; He rec ommends a return to the' one cent rate on drop letters in cities where the carrier : system is es tablished, making it uniform in that respect with ofSLces Jiot sup plied with carriers." ' Announcing the failure of the Edmunds , anti- pplygamy legislation,' r he. xecom mtends that congress take the im mediate political control of the territory of Utah for the; purpose of summarily extinguishing poly gamy. He again recommends that measures be taken for the protection of forests, and that the succession to tho presidency be given any needed legislation which the wisdom of congress may desire to prevent future disputes'. The civil service act ' is approved as a success and the ' promise giv en that any legislation whereby congress may lawfully supplement the guarantees contained - in the amendments will receive Execu tive approval. ' '"' ' " ' ' "' f' Facts and Figures ' People. for the For the instruction of our rea ders we condense the following facts from the reports submitted to congress by the heads of de partments. ' The Little Revenue Bill ap proved March 3, 1883, : will make an estimated reduction in governs ment revenues of $50,000,000 to 00,000,000 for the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1884. Estimates based on current res ceipts authorize the statement that there w ill be an excess of receipts over expenditures at the end of the current fiscal; year, June 30, of $60,000,000.: - ' The receipts for tho : year en ded June 30, 1883, wereJ.fSgsST,1-" 581.95. : '.. . 11 ' The total disbursements for. the same period were $265,403,137.54. The surplus revenue for this period was $132,879,444.42. The receipts were derived "e follows: ': From customs, $314,706,496.93. From internal revenue $154,720,- 36S.98. , From sales of public lands, $7,955,864.42. ' From tax on circulation and de posits of national banks, . $7,111," 008.85. , -? From profits on coinage, bullion, deposits and assays, $4,460,205.17. From all othersources, $17,333,- 637.60. The expenditures for pensions for the same period, $63,012,573.4. For civil expenses (salaries f civil ofiQcials), $22,342,285.76. Military expenses, $48,911,382. 93. , Saval expenses, $15,283,437.17. Public buildings, light house?, collecting the revenues, etc., 840, 098,432,73. ' For Indians, $ 7,362,590.34, Foreign intercourse, $2,419,275,- 24. Interest on public debt, $59,160,- 131.25. District of Columbia, $3,817,028,- 4S. With the surplus and $l,299,s 312.55 drawn from the treasury bonds to the amoimt of $134,178, 756.96 were redeemed and caus celled. The only outstanding bonds now redeemable at the pleasure of the government are the three per cents, amounting to about $305, 000,000. The remainder of the public 'debt is $250,000,000 In 4$ per cent, bonds, maturing :in 1691, and $737,000,000 i per cents matunog in 1897. The deposits of bonds to secure national bank circulation amount to about 8350,000,000. Nearly $200,000,000 of this amount is in 3 per cent bondst which willJbe. called.au and - the currency contracted to that amount unless congress provides by legislation for the emergency. The number of post? ofiices is 47,863. ; ' ; V." " Volume Fifteen With this issue the Herald and Tribune begins its fifteenth year of continuous publication. It was started in' 1869 by Drs. Mahoney & Wheeler, and remained -the property of Dr. , Mahoney until just prior to the presidential elec tiou in November, 1S76, when it was purchased by W. P.

Christ is a candidate for Doorkeeper of thi Senate we mean Gefrge Christ, of Dcs Moines, of course.

' The . democratic newspapers hav been interviewing , the great financiers and moneyed men on Carlisle's election and report; with glee that Gould aad Vanderbilt and a lonjjtet of bankers arc Satisfied therewith.- variety's sake suppose they interview those who arc really concerned in erery contest between protection and "revenue reform" the manufacturers, the laborers, and the far mers who feed them, and see what they think about this matter. - Desertions from the army have become en Mmmnn as to call for lcsislation. We are for the American soldier and against tii. iiirh-nriced dandies who are his vuu c mastcre by neglect of congress. The orivatc soldier is as good a man s the shoulder-strapped; fellow, and should Wp it rmv. The officer has no necessary expenses and should have his pay reduced. If the soldier must wor lot the officer labor beside him. One's no better than the other. : That erect democratic statesman Abram S. Hewitt is a dealer in . manu factured iron. He was recently asked to .put in a bid on some material for building and was underbid by an English concern. His care is, not to raise the duty on iron in his line, but take it off scrap iron, so that he can manufac ture cheaper. Which is to say, ' -Pro tect me as at present, but take protection from the American pig iron and its miners and thus enable me to bid against for eigners in furnishing manufactured iron made of foreign pig. ' This is commer cial statesmanship ! When a Boston girl sets miffed at her husband, she says, "Bise tyrant, I will leave th ee and fly to my mother." When a western girl becomes similarly affected she simply remarks: "Old man, I m going to cit ud and eit: and if you don't Lke it lust climb up on your eyebrows and seo . . t- i. n you can Slop mo. mtuiu'c. On similar occasions the southern girl grits her teeth and remarks in an ener getic kind of a way, . "You base villain! take that!" and the last f the chivalry takes it, of course, and goes off to the butcher and invests in beefsteak to put ou it in and wears goggles for a cinder in his eye a whole week. It is singular but true that following every decided democratic movement some silly thing is done somewhere in the sontlr which - is certain tor aggravate northern sensibilities. Right on the heels of Carlisle's election to the speaker ship news comes from Texas that a num ber of wealthy men intend to sue the United States for the value of their slaves who were emancipated, basing their claim for payment on a clause in the state constitution which instrument was ratified by congress. Such things have no political significance outside the fact that they may be regarded as results inspired by political causes. Washington Matteiis. Senator Ma hone attended the senate republican cau cus. Riddleberger was out of town, but was made chairman of committee on manufactures. Mahone is given the chairmanship on public buildings and grounds, and surrenders that on agri culture. . Senator Edmunds resigns the presi dency of the senate and will be succeeded by Senator Anthony. Senator Logan has introduced a bill to extend national aid to education in the states. He has not been friendly to the plan of distributing according to the ratio of .illiteracy aiid we presume the basis of his bill i population, which reduces the scheme to a mere- treasury grnb by the states. Mr. Oates, of Ala., introduced a bil1 . j . .i. . i in 1116 Liousc io aevoie me luuuueus of public lands to the education of the people.

The object of this bill is that Congress - shall meet -Immediately after the election of the members to the new Congress, instead 'of thirteen months after, as now, and - to provide for two long sessions of ea'ch , Congress, instead of one long and one short term, as now. Senator Logan has introduced a bill which provides that 80 acres of land be given to each volunteer soldier In the civil war who served one year or less. 120 acres to those who served over one year, and 160 acres to each man who served over two years. . - : A
