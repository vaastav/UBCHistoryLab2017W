'M Huch is tho general tenor of the annual ', I messago which Mr. Cleveland eent to Con- H gross yesterday tho President's fourth and J lost annual message. J J Tlio Introductory essay on tho tendency of 1 'gj tho limes Is for tho most part n repetition, in 9 f ' new and vaguer phrases, of tho ideas pre- I aontcd a year ngo, and in tho letter of ac- I ceptanco written last summer. What is not i j commouplaco Is not now, mid what Is new 1 k requires no especial attention. If any trace ! i of Irritation or shaken aelf-compUiccney Is apparent in this part of tho message. It may ji be found in those passages which refor to V the protected American manufacturers and (I tho alleged nrrosronco with which they as- jj eumo that tho Federal Government Is noth- m 1 Inn: more than an Instrument for Increasing I y tbolr own bank accounts. In one Or two pi ' passages of this sort there is almost a touch ft of that Indounablo quality which dlstln- Kulshea the utterances of cranks from thoso of philosophers. H But the main fact Is that nowhere does m Mr. Cleveland specify or even suggest ill any lino of policy to bo pursued in dealing with tho question of tho surplus and tho i , taxes. Ho contents Himself with expressing t tho opinion that "a Just and sensible re- 51 vision of our tariit laws should be made for hs tho relief of those of our countrymen who sudor under? present conditions;" and he dfctU($ Vfuehn revision should receive Jjj tho support' of all who love that justice and equality duo, Jo American citizenship, of all (VI wtmroAllxn that. In this lusticeand couall- ijjl ty our Government finds its strength i nd its'' power to protect tlio cltt- een nnd his property, of all who be ll Uevo that tho contented competence and I EjlJ comfortofmanynccordbettorwIththeBpIrlt j J of our institutions than colossal fortunes un I jl Ji fairly gathered "ji tho hands of a few, of all I II who appreclato that tho forbearance and I I'll fraternity among our people which recog I jiill nlzotho valuo of every American interest 1 I 11 aro tho surest guarantee of our national I progress, and of oil who desire to sej the it I It products of American skill and Ingenuity In 1 1 every maikct of the world, with a resulting 1 1 jilt testoration of American commerce." Tills 1 j tinescepUonable, if somewhat ponderous, UJIlJI yontiment belongs to the olass which in the HI raso of legislative bodies Is usually "ordered 

IJIJI spread ou tho minutes," and which In private ,ijMj 4, , communications calls for no other reply than lljjl "received, and contents noted." l J : Tho President has nothing further to offer lllii II " to ConSre63 la tho OTy ot speoiflo recorn- E Hill ruendations'ooiioernljig revenuo reduction. Rjll III If It bo asked how, under tho circumstances, rl'i it UQ cou,d expected to descend from gen- jjlj III emulation to suggestion, tlie only answer Is I1)! that he has not attempted to do so. IJI It Is proper to add, to tho everlasting lililll . credit of Mr. Cleveland, that In this for- ill ill I ' ' bearanco ho renders the Democracy a great II l II I and valuable service perhaps tho only ser ial IE ' ' 'lco Umt circumstances have left In lite III IS power to rondor to. tho party which took Hj j blm from obscurity and conferred upon him Hill cno "0 'KDest Poa t human ambition. HI Jf Benator Ingalla on the Negro Question. J HI Tliat was a noteworthy Interview with 1 1 J H Senator Inoalls which was printed on Sun- day in the Atlanta Constitution. When we I'll III ca" to tnm( Uwt tboBenator from Kansas 1 1 haa hitherto been classed with his colleague, ill fill 1 Mr- CnANDLEn' among the most aggresslvo 

IIIH brandlshers of the bloody shirt and the most II stalwart champions ot the programmo of lil f ' TnABDEUS Stevens, we ere startled by the ill! purport of hla explicit admissions, and still Iflil II I ' more by the tenor of the hints and overtures E that may' seemingly be read between the mil 111 i lines. Ifvtho Ucpubllcan President of the Wj HI " ' Senate and Mr. Oates, a Democratic Bep- HI g '' resontative from Alabama, bare not yet 3 1 " reached the same solution of tho race prob- II II II H 'em coufronttng the Oulf States, they are III I Id upporentiy approaching it upon converging Mi! HA - ' Unes. ''' ft 81 1 I It will be ( remembered th&t Mr. Oates ad jlll l vised the Southern whites to forego that pro Mi II portion of their representation In Congress JI HI crodlted to tho negro population In their I II 111 respective States, on condition that the II IS Federal Government should not meddle ii 111 with thou State and local administrations. J 1 1 Tho means which he proposed for the ot J I . talnmcnt of this object, namely, a constltu I Si 1 1 Uonal amendment diAfrancUlsing the negro llf HI ' all over the.TJnUed States, was upon Its face ill s impracticable, and. Is, ot course, repudl J l ated by 'Senator Inoalls. But while IS III rejecting the means suggested, tlio III III v latter substantially acknowledges the I 9 Hi ' end in view (the ascendancy of tho white fl l l race in State affairs) tp be reasonable enough i4 j H under the circumstances, and by Implication ill I) he favors, the alternative expedient provided Jllrll! " tto -c(,ia sectlpn ot the Fourteenth ' Amendment. For" After virtually admittlug 9 HI that the suppression of, t lie negro vote in llll I the Gulf Btotesjs -jUBtlnable from tho point If II 1 of yiow t'"the Southern whites, ho goes SI IJI on to cay that v " they" dannot euppress Iji HI - the vote and still retain the repreeen- Jill Utlou" apportioned to their negro fel- l I r low citizens. But Mr. Oates, as we il ' bave said, declares that he, speaking pre- ! IJI 'famablyfo'r'a'fractlon of Southern opinion, 'HI has no ideslio to do both, and that he I would cheerfully surrendor the negro's share j ot Federal representation In exchange for i '111 acquiescence In the rule of white men over Btato concerns! Now, it Is olear that If the j,1 Federal ("oTcmraent should enforce the la penalty prescribed by the second section of i & tho amendment above mentioned It would $ pmctlciiliy acquiesce In tho condition desired HI by Mr. Oates, because It would be estopped HI ' from Interfering in elections within the States subjected to tho penalty; or, In other words, deprived of the representatives in ig Congress allotted to their negro population. U That such a compromise is contemplated 'IIS by Senator Inoalls scorns fairly inferable, ilP : when we collato imd wrutlulse ennio of his J 1 1 slngulaily brand concessions, Io admits thot "tho icoonstructlon polloy may hao j i been premature or unwluo," altliough ho pro- ': Is nouncM It too late to discuss that question. ' He does "In fact discuss it, however, by ac ' . khowledglng that it tlio blaoks ot the Gulf ' States were allowed to vote, they would as a body oto against tho whites, and ho "sua- I Ii ' I - i pecta" that their impulse to do so Is not a casual or temporary' Cut nn abiding one: If abiding, It bears witness to that raco antagonism which, according to the Southern whiten, exJeta nnd con stitutes the gravest menace to civiliza tion In tho Gulf belt. Admitting tlio pres ence of such a danger, wo caiinot rcfuso to tho Southern whites our sympathy, nnd Sen ator Inoalls goes on to aver that thoy had It and would havo kept it it they hod not used tho icprescntatlon allotted to the negroes for tho purpose of tiontroHliig tho House ot Iteprcsentatlves nnd thus shaping Federal legislation. "Many Intelligent Northerners, o on among tlui Itepublicans" thesonro tlio Sonator'awordt " appreciate tho motives which Impel to tho suppres sion ot the colored vote, nnd admit that under similar clrcunetanccs they would bo strongly moved in the niiiio direc tion. It was on this account that tho sec tional appeal lost Its force in tlio North." Nor does Mr. Inoalls scniplo to add that there would be now "no disposition mnong ltcpubllcaus to Interfere In local or State government In tho South," it that section hud not attempted to force upon tlio North an obnoxious fiscal policy by meals ot majori ties In Congress and the elettoial college largely duo to tho representation by law grantod, but hi fact denied, to tho negro voir. In a word, according to this authentic spokesman, tho Hepubllcaus oro perfectly willing to let tho Southorn whites control their Btato affairs, provided they will give up so muchot their represent tion in Con gress as is apportioned to their suppressed negro vote. Now to this, iicrvrding tonn Alabama statesman, hh whlto biutluviiof tho South will or should ihenthilly iucnt. Under theso cliettnistances vi may expert to hear a good deul In tho coining twelxf month about the Oates proposition. Our Rullroiul 3IiiniiifM. It seems not unlikely that, some of our Western railroad managers will got Into trouble. Tho stockholders wIid have beeu all along so patient nro aroused to their dan ger, and propose to turn ihem out of the of fices they have betrayed. Thero Is nothing In our commercial history so dlsgmceful as tho record for the last twelvemonth of the Chicago, Burlington and Quijicy, tho Mil waukee and St. Paul, the Chleagu and North western, tho Itock Island, and the Chicago, Burlington and Northern. It. is not possible for tho most charitably minded person to acquit such men as Me&iri. Maiivtn HroniTT, CHABixa E. Pehkens, nnd It. It. CtBLE of their individual responsibility. They have squandeied millions of thepiop erty Intrusted to their care, and they stand preeminent to-day as types of tho very worst and most pernicious element that has ever become Identified with a great commercial Interest. They are unfit for tlw positions they fill. They have wrecked tho Interests they were elected to promote, nnd they should be dispossessed and turned out. It Is tlmo that the stockholder, demanded an accounting. Within a few days a general agreement was perfected and agreed to, look ing to tlio restoration ot a sound business footing for the Western railroads. It was defeated by the machinations of two of theso BOj-cnllcd trustees, and the work of wreckage and ruin continues unimpeded. Now let the stockholders como on tho scene and demand of Messrs. Cable, Perkins, el a!., n just and reasonable explanation ! Fail ing it, let those gentlemen tako the eon sequences. And there will be 110 ex planation; for there is nothlnx in tho acta of these Western railroad managers that is consistent with honesty or common sense, and thoy should bo extirpated root and branch as an examplo to all others. Things havo come to an evil pass when the trustees of the greatest public trusts are tho most conspicuous examples of chicanery and profligacy In high ofllco that the history of the country affords. Let tho stockholders como forward and right these wrongs. Let them go to tho great trust companies and hand in their proxies, and insist that their properties shall bo administered by men of common sense and common honesty. Then there will be reform, and a return to decent principles. Hundreds of families, heretofore assured of a respectable competency, ore to-day shorn of their entire resources, while the modest investments on which they relied havo shrunken one-halt all by reason ot tho fatuous obstinacy, stupidity, or downright dishonesty ot railroad managers. There must be an end to it. The remedy lies in the hands ot the stockholders, and nowhere else. A Topic for the Christian Conference. A Christian Conference, as It Is called, held its first session at Chlckering Hall, m this oity, last night. It is a meeting of clergy men and other phllanthroplcal persons who are interested In promoting the welfare of the community by religious work. Thero are to bo further sossions in the afternoon and evening to-day and to-morrow. The subjects on the programme for this after noon are the Bohemian clement, the Italian element, the colored element, and our duty to the foreign population. In tho evening the Baptist, Episcopal, and Methodist mis sions oro to be considered, and to-morrow the Bev. Dr. John Hall Is to speak upon Presbyterian church extension, and Mr. Ciiauncey. M. Depew upon Christianity as the world's great uplifting power. Wo desire to suggest an additional topic for the good peoplo ot tho Christian Con ference to think over and talk over. It does not rotate to the building of new churches where bo many existing churches are not more than half or a quarter filled every Suu doy, nor Is It as broad a theme as the In fluence ot the Christian faith upon the whole world. It comes right home, however, or ought to come right home, to every cltlzeu who has an iutercst in the proper adminis tration of our public charities. In the Evening Potl of Saturday appeared an account ot tho present state of tlio hos pital for tho Insane, which Is maintained by the city Government on Word's Island. The overcrowded condition ot this Institution Is simply disgraceful. Tlirco hundred and twenty patients are housed In nu mine which was never, designed, and is not fit to be used, as a dwelling place for the Insane. "In all the cells intended for one bed there were two, and sometimes three, with Just enough room to hqueozo between the beds. In ono room, 15 feet by 20, thero wero eight!" And across tho rher in Kings county tho condition ot things appears to be even worse. In the Brooklyn Eagle of Saturday wo find a piesentment of tho Grand Jury giving un nceouut of thplr vhUt to the county buildings, Including the insane asylum at Flatbush. " We found this build iug," Bays the Grand Jury, "to bo in a ery crowded condition, so much bo that the cellar had to bo used, which place in our opinion Is not lit for human beings, the walls nt the sldo being damp and unwholesome And we recommend that tho occupation of this cellar bo discontinued, and tliat tho present Inmates bo removed as fust us practicable." Tho Grand Jury aUo declared that tho meat was poor and unlit for uso. " Tho ex cuse offered for this was that It was tho rem nants, and that a fresh (supply would soon 4 arrive, whloh' would be better, this had hardly boon said when tho cart arrived oon talnlng moat and poultry, and upon examin ing this wo found it very inferlortn Quality." What a commentary theso facto furnish upon the efficiency of Christian charity In theso two great cities ! Thousands and tons of thousands ot dollars nro expended an nually for eharltoblo purposes In Now York and Brooklyn, and yet In the two Institu tions especially maintained by tho munici pal governments for the core of thoso who nw mentally Incapabloof coring for thorn' selves, wo flnathopntientslnonnclty packed into small sleeping rooms like sordines lit a box, and In tho other inhabiting noisome cellars niul fed on tnlned meat. Wo have said nothing about the publlo aspect of thofo matter", or as to tho duty of tho3o officers primarily charged with tlio ad minifitrntion of theso Institutions to roform the abuso3 without delay. But wo desiro partlculntly to call tho attention of these Christian" now in confeicnca ton Held In which their exertions might bo as oileotlvo as in the other hospitals and dimities where thoy do so much good work. (iri'inuiiy In .s.imuit. Tlmo 1 only n bilef nnd un.alfae tory leference In tlio President's message to the stale of .iffaiiu lu tlio Siimoan Islands; and yet In the whole range of our prewmt diplomatic lelatlons, with tho slnglo excei tlonof the Canadian fishery question, thcie is no HUbjoct of equal Importance. Samoa might very well hao beeu left nloiiuto 1x5 seized, .without protest on our part, by Geimuny or Kuglaml or uny other Kmopcm power coveting the gioup. But tlit MtuaMoni-rmngmlvvhcn Secretary Bay Anu lii'.tructeu Minister Pen dlki ox to no tify the Goi iimn Government, "temperately, but decidedly." that tho United Statc3u.s- s-erted in light to a voice In thenrrange nicut of Siimojn destinies. 'the position then taken by Mr. Bayard waa maintained by him in a long sunes of declarations instructions, mid other official expressions. It cau only be-abandoned ut tho sacilllco of national self-respect. Germany's steady policy or aggression in Samoa takes account neither of Mr. Bay ahd's protects nor ot his amazement ot being so basely deceived by diplomatists in whoso lepresentatiou he had tiustcd. No attention whatever Is paid to the elaborate and carefully worded communications which he iires at Berlin. Tho incident is fast shap ing itself Into n national humiliation for us and n subject of ridicule for the whole out- sine worm oi uipiomocy. It ia not encouraging to bo Informed by the President tliat In the subsequent corre spondence which will bo laid before Con gress "the history ot events in those islands will bo found." Wo know already too much of the history of events in Samoa. What is needed Is moro light on the histoi y of events in Mr. Bayahd's department. There is no Unci passage in the President's mo'sage than that which is hero subjoined: "Our mtKflon amuisr !t nations of tho eiitli. ana our ucccu In acrumpllnMni; the worL Onu h glrtn the American people to do. require of thoe lntrmied with the matin; nd execution of our lw perfect devotion, ftuovo all other tiling, to tho public cood." And jot melancholy thought! when has any Consress of tlio United States, or any Pres ident ot tho United States, or any leslMativo body or executive authority in any country ot tho ii. oriel, manifested a perfect duvotion to the public good? Absolute unselfishness, ab solute v lsdom, perfection these terms are not compatible with American nature. Keverthe lesR it ii a lino sentiment la the department ot political ethics. The White Cap outrages, now referred to almost dally iu The Sun's press despatches from Ohio, oro perpetrated in tho counties lying alone the dliio lUvcr. All the Whtto Cap outrages of tho lost five years in Indiana have been perpetrated in the counties of that State upon tho same river. The country is of the same rich and productive cbnr&ater in both Htntes, but it it ahockinsly evident that the people and conditions in that part of Ohio are similar 40 those in tho White Cap region ot Indiana. It is a retrograding population that repulse immigration, is, weakened by constant intermarriage among a few families, and has lost respect for the laws because they have not been fearlessly administered Tho people of Indiana have tamely allowed whole counties to be terrorized for years by the White Caps. It seems not reasonable to suppose that another such weak-kneed Gov ernment can be found nmonc the States. It is moro likely that tho white-capped niciit riders will get their quietus in Ohio. We would ie spectlully sugaeat to Messrs. Kuiriun, Mc Kxnlet, FoiUKJir, and othor distinguished Buckoyos that until this happens Ohio will de serve to bo left out of tho next Cabinet. Among popular delusions there is the strougest ovldenco for supposing that the iren oial estimate of Kentucky is ono. Tho evi dence is a blue grass statement itsolf. Upon the idea that tho Kentucky gentleman does nothing but tight duels, hear the Courier Journal: "If n elementary knotriedce of the rudimentary principles of the code ero a qualification for Kuilraf e. there would be no voting In Kentncicy. Tho KentuokUn will fljht on the liutaut, and Mmetlmet will goa-jrun nine for ble adversary, after sending him duo notice, tnt ngntlnz according to the code, in other words, tight Inn a formal duel, is almost au unknown occurrence. nd, lth rare exception, the Kentucky gentleman does not know how to write a cuaUeuro. how, as second, to itrllTer It. how to makollto preliinluary arrauiremeuts, and how to confirm to the cerrmoules 011 tho field ac cord tic to nrliat is so glibly spoken of aa tho code.' " And as to the Kentucky gentleman's relation to the lluiil known to science as li'O, to the world K'jnerally u water, hear tku l.uulsellle Comiiiiiual: "The Kentucky whiskey Joke has gray whiskers reaching to the kneis, and most on Its back six Inches long Keep 011 using It It yon n ill, fellow scrib blers, bet for humanity s sake cut its hair and scald U."

Tho gigantic proportions ot the pension system ot tho Unltod 8tates nro seen in tho report ot the Seorotary ot the Intorlor. Thero is no such system in any other country of the world, and It is growing at a wonderful rate. Tho Secretary shows that In tho fiscal year ending with Juno last tho amount paid for Pensions to old soldlors was $76,773,802, or nn incroasoof t5.T08.2S0 over the previous year. Tho oxpcndlturo3 of tho Pension Bureau for tho year constituted 31 par cent, ot the total disbursements ot tho Government, and ill.1 percent, of its total crofs income Truly.no ono can dony that tho velorans of thewaraie liberally dealt with. All that we doslro in tho case ie that tho legislation regarding tho grant ing of poaBlons bo consistent with common sonso, and tlio same ooslro is entertained by all who vroro honorable soldiers of tho Union.

VttutfeU'Ata ttcora Among tho various forecasts of the Presi dent's futuro tho career ot a publloist has never before been suggested. Apubllotu is a writer on international law. We observe with groat intercut that in the American Aarinilturist't picture of tho cele brated Koldlug Guy, the trottlne phenomenon of this onr, tho horno is loprosontod as lower across tho rump than ut the withers, That voteran in experionco with trottinz horses, 3tr. Alvlx GoLnsxtiTn. ouco said that, so far as be knew. Edwin Forrest was tho only giont horse shaped In this way. In all other first-class rivers, such as tit. .Tulionor Maud B. or Gold smith Mntd, the nitbora were lower than the rump. Perhaps Mr. Goldsmith's opinion, which nlwavs seomed sound, was dorived from too limited opportunities tor observation. It is un intorosttng point for consideration by breodors of trottots. The leflso of the Alaska Commercial Com panv. by which it monopolizes the seal trade und largely controls tho affair of a gieat part of the Alaskan coast, will expire In about a j ear. The company now desires a renewal of its lease. Any ono who reads in Tub Bun to day the narrative ot the scandalous treatment ot tho Aleuts by agents of this company will be convinced that the privileges of this great monopoly cannot propotiy bo renewed before. Congress has thoroughly investigated these xerious charges, which are made, not onl by tho natives but also by Government official and too Governor or tut) Territory. The pa thetic appeal for relief mode by these belploss natives will be heard by our peoplo. and the authorities at Wnshinktoa will certainly be expected to revolutionize the present condition of affairs in Alaska it it proves, after careful Inquiry, to be what it now seems to be. a dis grace to our civilization. An estimate of the education nnd Intelli gence of a country may Ikj made from its postal business; and the report of the Postmaster General is of Interest la this respect He shows that tho United States surpasses every other country in the volume of mail matter trans mitted, In tlio cheapness ot postage, in the postal rovenue and expenditure, in tho oxtent of mail routes, in the numbor of Post Offices, and in tho average number of piecos of mall matter to each inhabitant The countries that como next in order aro Gront Britain, Ger many, and France; butllussio. Austria, Spain, and Italy are so fur behind that they form a subject of contrast rather than of comparison. Thoreadlngaad writing habits ot the people of the United Btates are the result of the school systom which pervades all parts of our country. Tlio prodigious development of the busi ness, the wealth, and the power ot tho Ameri can peoplo, as shown by the annual reports of the various departments ot the Government lust submitted to Congress, must bo a matter of pride to every patriot who enjoys life and liberty under the Btar-spanaled Banner. There are now just about a quarter of a million of Indians in the United Btates, or, to give the exact figures of the Decretory of the Interior, there ore 246,095. The Secretary speaks ot them la highly favorable terms. They are almost universally peaceable and orderly; thoy are advancing morally and so cially, steadily progressing In civilization; many ot them are engaged in agriculture and cattle breeding, and the efforts to promote their education are meeting with success, as is shown by the existence among them ot 233 schools, containing over 13,000 pupils of both sexes. It must encourage all friends of our red brethren to read the report about them just submitted to Congress by Becrotary Vilas. Morrlaon MIsM Hare Been as Beer II rummer Jrom Ihe Ctiltaoo Daily Arir. Among a party of frlonds in Washington tho other evening Commissioner William Ik Morrison told st good story on himself.
