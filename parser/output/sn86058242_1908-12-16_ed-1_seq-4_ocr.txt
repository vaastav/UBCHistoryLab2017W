It is quite possible that Maxwell never got off Manhattan Island and it have traveled farther than Hohoken. woman, be she a working woman or a do too much. However, it is not necessary to make any defense of the American woman because Maxwell has have done a pretty good job or he brains enough to make such an idiotic statement. She does more In one day than a lot of men would want to do in a week. We know public school teachers for instance who keep house for their parents and whose brothers are hanging around the streets doging up at four In the morning to get breakfast for his aged father and mother and then going to school to teach. There is not a working girl in this country who does not do more actual manual labor in one day than her employer does in two. Look at the farmer's wife ! Look at the house wife, who works from morning till night and brings up a family of children! We call Supt. Maxwell of the New York schools a thorough cad. ALL THE DEMOCRATS LACKED WAS MONEY. Those who are keeping in elose touch with the alleged election fraud contest at Crown Point believe that it will result in one thing, that is in showing that if there were any naturalization frauds in Lake county the democrats will be found as guilty as the republicans. According to the tes timony delivered, by, County Chairman F. R. Schaaf on the witness stand yesterday, he received implicit instructions to , hew close to the line in get ting naturalization papers for his proteges and so instructed the naturalizers. No one doubts Mr. Schaaf 's word. As far as is known up here the Indian apolis News has no divine authority to prejudge the Lake county republican leaders. It is declared by witnesses that the democrats only lacked the money to pay naturalization expenses. The Indianapolis News is averse to giving this prominence, but is ready to start the hue and cry after what it is pleased to denominate reupblican fraud and trickery. It is trying to foul its own nest and there is little question but what the outcome of the contest at Crown Point will be. It won't require any clairvoyant or seventh daughter . of the seventh daughter to prophesy its outcome. None of the state officers elected on the republican ticket are doing any worrying or passing any sleepless nights, however. No one has heard the republicans accusing the democrats of fraudulent ill beseems the democrats to cry "wolf." , THE STORY HAD BEEN DENIED BEFORE. The news published in the TIMES Steel corporation had not gobbled up Hammond was glad news for Hammond people. Contrary stories have been published since then by other papers, but the next day after the Pittsburg Post had published its story that the deal had been closed, E. H. Gary of the United States Steel corporation, who might be expected to know at least as much as some of the newspapers that know all about it, said that there was not a word of truth in the stories andiot even in the rumors. There is no use. for Hammond people to be alarmed . Let those knock, the . Standard Steel Car plant as much as they wish. It is not going to became the property of the United States Steel corporation, unless the officials of the steel trust have deliberately lied. The Standard Steel Car plant will not be gobbled up by any one. THE PISTOL HABIT. The true remedy for the "pistol habit" must be a. wider application of higher ideals in our business and social life, by which aggressions upon the rights of others, shall oease or at least become amenable to righteous judg ment and not mere technical interpretations by judges sworn to do their whole duty to preserve the rights of the people. The spirit of aggression upon the rights of others must result in one or two conditions unless the nation puts a quick stop upon the whole business by upholding the unalien able rights of the people as against alien interests, or by putting upon the latter such restraints as shall bring them under the law as servants of and supplicants for popular favor and not as masters of those by whom the favors are supposed to be granted. ....... DON'T OVERHEAT YOUR HOUSE. One of our exchanges proffers some good advice about the dangers of overheated houses at" this sesgson of late furnace and steam heat to correspond with the demands of comfort. If not permited to burn too hard for the necessities of the case a furnace is perversely inclined to sulk and not is likely to overheat the house to such an extent that colds are easily con tracted. Attention should also be paid to keeping a proper amount of moist ure in the air, as hot, dry air Is conducive- to pneumonia. . inu liaitiS jn Hi v H.K took anything extended him the courtesy in telling the people what he had to say In regard to permitting a mayor to succeed himself.

Born eari to Heart Talks. By EDWIN A. NYE. i Copyright, 1908, by Edwin A. Nya. BROKE FAITH: KILLED HER.SELF. In a fit of remorse because she had worked on a Jewish holiday Fannie Cbanon, a young girl of Chicago, com mitted suicide. The spirit of Torn Kippur was in the air as bright faced children jour neyed with their elders to the syna gogues and temples and there prayed for forgiveness for their trespasses. But the day of atonement held noth ing for tbe girl Who eat In the park and said to herself: "Their right is no longer mine. I have held aloof and will not be forgiven." "Do you not go to shnle, Fannie?" asked one of her friends of the girl In the park. The latter turned away without answer. So, most of the day, while tbe people were in the synagogues, neither eat ing nor drinking, but praying until the dusk closed on the day of atonement, the girl brooded in the park. And then she remembered how, when Rosh Hasuono ushered in the Jew ish new year, instead of going to syn agogue she had worked all day at tbe factory, where she sewed buttons on cloth. -. She had broken faith! In despair the poor girl left the park in the late afternoon. She sought her opportunity and threw herself front the platform in front of an elevated train and was picked up, crushed, bleeding, mangled, dead. A single scrap of paper was found in one of her pockets. It said: "As it should be, it was." And this story of her cruelly pathet icis here recorded because It gives one a glimpse into the depths of a hu man soul. You say there was not sufficient cause for suicide, it was all a super stitious fancy, this anguish that tore the Jewish girl's heart. But Put yourself in her place. Perhaps you cannot The faith of your fathers has lost its hold on you. Or, if not soj you cannot realize what the departure of , a great faith may mean. Nevertheless this Js true. Life without faith is impossible. Existence without faith is possible, but life normal, ahundant, high pur posed and joyous life without faith is Impossible. "As it should be, so it was." That is a fatalistic sentiment. but Hopeless is that soul that sees no morning break with promise, that feels no pulsing thrill of joyous faith. The poignancy of. such hopelessness may not end In suicide but it is the logical end. in Poland about 1600. 1714 George Whttefield, celebrated evangelist, born In Gloucester, England.

Yet Mr. Roose velt in the absence of law. offi cially proposes to use all the power of the greatest government on earth to cripple the freedom of the press oa tbe pretext that tbe government itself is libeled and be Is the government. TJO other man ever so. grossly libeled the United Statea aa does this president who be smirches congress bnildosea judges, assails the integrity of courts, slanders private citlsena and who has shown himself the most reckless, unscrupulous demogogua whom the American people ever trusted with great power and authority.

Two suits were yesterday filed in the United States circuit court against Ralph Burton of Peru, Ind., by the Ra- democratic national committee. It was Mr. Cromwell's own action which raised the issue In tbe campaign. ROOSEVELT SAYS: JN point of encouragement or iniquity, in point of Infamy of wrongdoing, there is nothing to choose between a pa bile Servant who betrays his trust and a pub lic servant who is guilty of blackmail or theft or- financial -dishonesty of any kind, and a man guilty as Mr. Joseph Pulitser baa been guilty In this Instance. JT Is therefore a high national duty to bring to Justice this clllifler of tbe American people, this man who - wantonly and wickedly and without one shad ow of jnstlfleaUen, seeks to blacken tbe churaeter of reput able private citizens, and to con vict tbe government of hia own country, In tbe eyes of the civ ilized world, of wrongdolng of the basest and foalest kind, when he has not one shadow of Justifi cation for the charge he haa made. TTTHILE the criminal offenses of of which Mr. Pulitser has been guilty is in form a libel upon Individuals, the great Injury done is in blackening the good name of the American people. rjiHE wickedness of the slanders ders is only surpassed by. their f atalty.
