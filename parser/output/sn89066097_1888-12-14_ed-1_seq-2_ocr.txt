tsr,-!S3p5rngS & Ii i T.HE WEEKLY GRAPHIC T. K. Sublette, Proprietor. KIRKSVILLE . - MISSOURI FRIDAY DEC. 14, 1SSS. The number of votes cast in the United States nt the recent election is about 12,000,000. The tendency of prices is upward since the election of Har rison admission to Normal en tertainments have incrensed S3 1-3 per cent. Potatoes are retailing in western Kansas at 81.00 a bushel; apples, $1.50; Hour, So.25 per 100 lbs; coal, $0.00 per ton, and every thing else proportionately high. Tho United States Fish eries Association have adopted resolutions asking Congress for such legislation as shall make our navy respectablo in sizo and quality. It is stated on good authority that the president-elect is a rela tive of Jefferson Davis. However the relationship will be no induce ment to offer Jefferson i cabinet position. The Si-nate has begun the consideration of the tariff bill, and President Cleveland may have ul opportunity during the life of the Fiftieth congress to write another blundering veto. mi - tt i i , j.ne xif"t ims taicen up the direct lax ic funding bill. The time for voting on this bill was fixed at 4 o'clock, Wednesday afternoon, when, it was thought THE

"West Tlrg.iiia has proba- blj' elected c ' omocratie govern or and Democratic electors, but the plurality is so small that West Virginia may hereafter be count ed cs a Republican state. m The Florida orange crop is estimated at 3,000,000 boxes, which is more than double the product of any previous year. ButtheFlordia crop will not be one-half the oranges sold in our markets. Missouri's leeislature-oleet is made up of 21 democrats, 9 re publicans and 1 labor union re publican in the senate; tho house contains 7S democrats, 51 republi cans, 11 union-labor. On ioint ballot the republicans have gained, largely due to the city of St. Louis. While prices for farm pro ducts and stock of nearly all kinds have been unsatisfactory for three or four years, tho draft horse has brought uniformly good prices. The owner of a good draft-hoico never has to search for a market; tho market always comes to him and the prices ob tained arc invariably renumera- tivt. Leading Democratic joirrnals and poliiticiaus now concede that a solid south is no longer tenable. Tho naked truth is that tho South will not remain solid and no effort of her politicians can keep her in that condition. Virginia, West Virginia, Ala bama, Georgia, Xorrh Carolina and Tcnuesseo can be depended upon to ultimately become repub lican states. The politicians view the ominous signs of tho times and are already casting nbout for methods of vigorous propagation of Democratic priciples in the agri cultural states of the west, thinking that a power can be placed in tho hands of these states that will s weep away and entirley c'lestroy tho protective policy of the conn- try. Tho Democratic party cr m make no greater mistake, than to attompt to regain its power by tiro aid bf western farmers. ThiB is the con clusion to which an educational campaign has brought uv j majori ty of the people. It is notable that the appeals to the farming class to voto for Free Trade were entirely ignored, and that tho great agricultural states voted for Harrison in a body, Min nesota, the hope of the Free Trad ers, giving him tho largest vote she has ever given to any candi date for tho Presidency. The farmer has to earn what he WASHINGTON LETTER. Senator Allison has proven himself n truo prophet in ralalion to tho republican substitute for the Mills tariff bill, tho Senate having promptly taken the mcasuro up, and the defeat of Senator Harris' motion to lay on tho table makes it absolutelv certninth.it tho bill will pass fho benalo substantially in its present shap. lliiis tho democratic predictions of division in the republican ranks on thejturifrjbavc boon effectually disposed of. The only item in tho measure that is not wholly approved of bv the republicans, is thai jomoviug the tax from alcohol used in manufact ures and tho arts, and that is not opposed, but somo republicans, among them Senator Sherman, have doubts as to whether tho enforcing of that portion of the bill will not have a tendency to encourage fraud, But this doubt will not cause them to vote against that section on tho bill. On the contrary they express them selves anxious to see tho experi ment tried, believing tho result aimed at to be a good one. Contrary to general expectation, tho opening to Congress found about two thirds of both Houses in their seats. Mr. Cleveland's message, tuough an unusually long one, made little impression on the members, owing largely to the bad temper displayed in that portion ot it relating to the tariff, pension, and other Congressional legislation. But the republican members, who are feeling partic ularly good, found little difficulty in excusing nun lor the County Court Proceeding'.

It is also a potent fact, that iimeiy-seven per cent or our peo ple were farmers when the -protective policy was first adopted, and this class is still able to give any shape it may desire to our na tional policy. Many ot them recollect what farming way under a Free Trade system anrl nearly all have experienced the improve ment in their condition by the growth of manufacture?; in their vicinity.

Senator Vance made several ineffectual attempts Io amend the internal revenue section of the Senate tariff bill in tho interest of his "moonshiner" constituents, whom he fears may be put in jail by the new Federal officials, but iho republicans promptly voted them down, not being influenced by tho fear of the "moonshiners" votes. A resolution has been offered in the House making the postal telegraph bill a special order for Dec. 14. It wts referred to the committee on rules, but it is not thought that it will be possible to get this bill up until late in the session, if at all. Mr. Springer endeavored to get unanimous consent of tho House on "Wednesday io call no the omnibus bill for the admission of Dakota, Montana, Washington and New Mexico.

However it would hardly bo advisable to be gin negotiations at tho close of a retiring administration, which has bungled every matter of diploma cy it has attempted.

Continuing, Mr. Payson said: 1 have no desire to conceid our motive for admitting the territories in the spring. "We have a very small majority in each House. More especially in the Senate is it desirable that this majority should be increased in fho Fifty-first Confess. These three Territories aie enti tled to representation during the now Congress. I think we should admit these territories durinc an extra spring session, so that thev may be fully organized into States and send six Senators and as many Representatives as they are entitled to, to bo regularly en rolled as o part of the Fifty-first Congress at the regular meeting in December. This would give us a good working majority in both branches of Congress. There are now four avowed candidates in the field for the speakership of the next House, Messrs Peed, Mckinlej-, Cannon and JJurrows; and tho friends of each express themselves as con fident of winning, but if the caucus was to bo held now I doubt very much whether any of them could command a majority, so evenly does their strength appear to be devided. This will of course all be changed as time goes on and changes are made for various reasons. The chances are, in my opinion, that after the first ballot m the caucus there will be only two candidates, and thev will be Peed and McKinley, and the chances of election seems to bo slightly in favor of McKinley, but not suf ficiently so to make his selection certain. There are several gentle men that are being groomed as dark horses, in the belief that each of the leading candidates will hold strength enough to prevent either of the others receiving the nomination. They all are good men. No objection is mado to nnv of them. It is simnlv a onpsHnn of personal popularity that is to no settled Dy caucus nomination. 20 2.1 7 00 5 72 100 5 00 5 00 5 50 SKI 0 00 200 T.i 00 10 13 7 50 S5 00 :iooo 170 00 700 22 71 10 00 5 00 15 00 15 00 15 00 The lollowinir tieihnns bad inorffin'pK released: Dan'l Miller, Augustus Lowe, Jas Cov .las W SIboIe.
