| ^ the Cabinet It is a unit ou the splcudid con servative policy of the President, as set forth ia bis Mcssago. The effect of that document will be worth half a dozen victories in the field, be cause it reassures the country that the frenzied efforts of the abolitionists will not succced in niakinj, a change in the principles on which the I'reaident declares the war shall bo conducted. Tub Gamk Neaiilt Up with tiie Rebels a New Oiii.eaN3. ? The letter which we published .yesterday from a gentleman juit returned from New Orleap:,, taken in connection with the in telligence of the Un:on conspiracy recently dis covered there, proves that thegnmc of rebellion I- nearly played out in that city. With pro vision* of every kind at famine prices, and the minds of the terrorists distracted by the fear of insurrection, it is not likely that the feeling of "loyalty which is known to exist among the working classes there can be initch longer kept down. We are convinced that it recjuires but an effective demonstration on the part of our fleet to bring back New Orleans to its allegiance to the federal government. When we have 'finished up with Savannah and Charleston, we will turn our attcation to the traitors of that ? city. "Honest Aiie Lincoln" and the Aiiot.itiox ' Ists. ? The President's Message, on the slavery question, will reassure the country, andghc new heart and reuewed hope to the loyal men of the South awaiting their deliverance. Our disorganizing abolitionists are taken aback, and will soon begin to show their teeth, no ?doubt; but as "llonest Old Abe" has "scthis "foot down firmly,'" the two houses of Congress "will sustain him. The only trouble to be ap prehended is from such abolition disturbers of the public harmony as Sumner. But let the ?conservative men in Congress be Arm and de cided, and everything will come out right. We ?ha!l soon put down this rebellion, restore the Union, and resume with a new impulse of grea^ power our glorious career of peaceful prospe rity.

THK IlKrOKTKD DISAGRKEMIOT IN TUB CABINBT. There in a class of people is this city who employ their time in inventing falsi hoods and circulating them, and when any of these reports reach the newspapers the in ventors thereof chuckle in their sleeves, and boast that Lhey havo sold somebody. Yesterday and last night the :las* of persona alluded to started tho absurd report that thero had been a row in the Cabinet, and that the quarrel was chiefly between Seward and Cameron; that the former announced his intention to resign if Ca meron's report was not changed, and that Cume* ?on swore he would resign If it was; and, finally hat it was agreed that It should be partially al.' ered; that Cameron submitted gracefully , and h.irmony was restored. This whole statement was an invention of 1 fellow who bad been snubv,ad by Gen. Cameron, be jausc the latter had refused to comply w'th the former's lemands for contracts. The falsifier was sent for by a tovernment officer and properly reprimanded. That tho tessaft and reiorts were examined and properly dis missed, as Is the practice In such cases., is true: some irere, perhaps, modified; but that the best of good foeliug irevaiioil between the President and different members if tho Cabinet, and that such fueling exi ts now, Is a KMitivc and well known fact. riSlT OF GK.NRRAIi
