5T- 0 The Commoner. tVILLfAM J. BRYAN, EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR ft" iy..)Vf. U.i. ) VOL. 11, NO. 49 Lincoln, Nebraska, December 15, 1911 e& T Whole Number 569 Eederal Incorp oration - In his annual message to congress President Taft renews his recomtnendation for a federal incorporation act, As The Commoner haB fre quently pointed out, this is one of the most dan gerous among all the dangerous changes sought to be made by the special Interests. George W. Perkins, the associate, of J. Pierpont Morgan, may be said to be the originator of this plan so far as present day agitation is concerned but in-its nature It is older than Perkins and older even than America itself. It is, in truth, part jnd Jarcel of the doctrine of kings so far aa that doctrine may be applied to a people strug gling for the preservation of popular govern ment. It means centralization in the federal government of control over great corporations and would make it that much more difficult for the people, to obtain justice at the hands of their corporate servants. Mr. Taft says that the federal charters pro posed by him "should be voluntary at least until experience justifies mandatory provision." But under his plan the corporation could select the federal government as its watchman and it is safe to say that it would take advantage of the opportunity with the same readiness it has ever shown preference for federal courts. Mr. Taft has placed the cart before the horse on this proposition. He has given choice to the wrong party. Under our system of government the state must be the creator of corporations and whenever the time comes that that method should be changed then the people should make ..the choice and the people alone are entitled to... say whether in their capacity as the members of the state they are willing to surrender this control over their corporate creatures. The federal government may well prohibit . a corporation that has beon convicted of lawless conduct from doing an inter-state business, thus shutting it up in the state of its origin. That is the plan suggested by Mr. Bryan but the suggestion that the federal government be em powered to issue corporation charters is centra lization gone mad. THE 

DUAL SCHEME The democratic party is pledged to defend the constitution and enforce the laws of the United States, and it is also pledged to respect and pre serve the dual scheme of government instituted by the founders of the republic. The name, United States, was happily chosen. It combines the idea of national strength with the idea of local self-government, and suggests "an indis soluble union of indestructible states." Our revolutionary fathers, fearing the tendencies toward centralization, as well as the dangers of disintegration, guarded against both; and na- CONTENTS FEDERAL INCORPORATION THE DUAL SCHEME THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE GOOD FOR MR.

VNEWS OF THE WEEK WASHINGTON NEWS . tipnaj safety, aa wen aa domestic security. Is liL .f0,md ft the eyeful observance of the limitations which they imposed. It will be noticed that, while the United State guaran tees to every state a republican form of gov ernment and is empowered to protoct each state against invasion, it is not authorized to intor rere In the domestic affairs of any state except upon application of the legislature of the state, ?u "P0?6 application of the executivo when tne legislature can not bo convened. uh ProvIsIn rests upon tho sound theory that the people of the state, acting through their legally chosen representatives, are, because of their more intimato acquaintance with local conditions, better qualified than the president to judge of the necessity for federal assistance. Those who framed our constitution wisely de termined to make as broad an application of tho principles of local self-government as circum stances would permit, and we can not disputo the correctness of the position taken by thera without expressing a distrust of tho people themselves. The states are even more needed than they formerly were for the administration of domes tic affairs. As a matter of theory, that govern ment is best which is nearest to tho people. If there is any soundness at all In the doctrine of self-government, the people can act most in telligently upon matters with which they are most familiar. There are a multitude of things which can be done better by tho state than by the federal government. An attempt to trans fer to the national capital the business now con ducted at the state capitals would bo open to two objections, either oljgjhkJvwould be fatal. First, congress coisranot transact tho business. The work now devolving on the national legis lature makes it difficult to secure consideration for any except tho most important measures. The number of bills actually discussed in a deliberate way is small; moot of the bills that pass are rushed through by unanimous consent, and a still larger number die on the calendar or in committee. Second, the members of congress could not inform themselves about local needs. The in terests and industries of the nation are so diver sified and the various sections so different in their needs that the members of congress from one part of the country would be entirely Ignorant of the conditions in other parts of the country. Whenever congress attempts legislation now for a particular section, the matter is usually left to the members from that section, but more often the matter is crowded out entirely by larger interests. The farther the legislative body is from tho community affected by the law, the easier it is for special interests to control. This has been illustrated in state legislatures when long-time charters have been granted to franchise cor porations by the votes of members whose con stituents, not being interested, do not hold them to strict account, and it would be worse if congress acted on the same subjects. 

GOOD FOR MB. STEPHENS A Washington dispatch to the Omaha World Herald, says: "Congressman Stephens refused to accept salary for the period between the death of Latta and his own election, sending tho following letter to Sergeant-at-Arms Johnson: '"I understand there has been placed to my credit in your office the full salary appropriated for my district and left unused by my predeces sor, who died September 11, 1911. I certainly am not entitled to receive salary prior to tho date of my election and I therefore desire you to return to tho treasurer of the United States that portion of this amount which is aproxl mately $1,200 and which accumulated prior to the date of my election to the house of rep resentatives November 7, 1911.' "This action is without precedent In the house, It is believed." Mr. Stephens Is to be congratulated- He has made a good beginning but he has done noth ing more or less than his friends expected of him. The President's Message In his annual message the prosidont says: "It has beon said that tho court, by introducing into tho construction of tho statute common law distinctions, has omasculated It. Thin la obviously untruo. By Its Judgment ovory con tract and combination In restraint of Interstate trade made with tho purpoBo or necessary effect of controlling prices by stilling competition, or of establishing In whole or in part a monopoly of such trade, Is condemned by tho statute. Tho most extremo critics can not inntanco a case that ought to bo condemned under tho statute which is not brought within its terms as thus construed." If that is truo then why has Mr. Taft neglected to cause tho arrest of John D. Rockefeller and other Standard Oil leaders, togethor with the Tobacco trust magnates, under tho criminal clause of tho Sherman anti-trust law? Tho supremo court in tho oil and tobacco decisions declared that these particular trusts and tho men maintaining them had violated tho law. Indeed, Mr. Taft himself gives in his message, particular emphasis on tho "anti-trust" quality of theso decisions. Ho says: "In tho Standard Oil case tho supremo and circuit courts found tho combination to bo a monopoly of tho interstate business of refining, transporting and marketing petroloum and Its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different corporations, tho stock of which waB held by a Now Jcrsoy company. It in effect commanded tho dissolution of this combination, directed tho transfer and pro rata distribution of tho New Jersey company of tho stock held by it in the thirty-sovon corporations to and among its stockholders; and tho corpora tions and individual defendants woro enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly, and all agreements between tho sub sidiary corporations tending to produco or bring about further violations of tho act were enjoined. "In tho tobacco case, the court found that the individual defendants, twenty-nine In num ber, had been engaged In a successful effort to acquire complete dominion over tho manufac ture, sale and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad, and that this had been done by combinations mado with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices and establish a monopoly, not only In tho manufac ture of tobacco, but also of tin-foil and licorice used in its manufacture and of Its products of cigars, cigarettes and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate tho will of the court and end the violation of the statute. There was here no single holding company as in tho case of the Standard Oil trust. The main company was tho American Tobacco company, a manu facturing, selling and holding company. The plan adopted to destroy the combination and restore competition involved the redlvlslon of tho capital and plants of the whole trust be tween some of the companies constituting the trust and new. companies organized for the pur poses of the decree and made parties to it, and numbering, new and old, fourteen." In this same message Mr. Taft predicts Jail sentences for trust magnates in future prosecu tions under the Sherman anti-trust law. Will some one kindly explain In the president's biv half why he again asks the people to wait an' why he does not call the oil and tobacco mag nates to account under the criminal clause crv tho law w,hlch he says was so vigorously upheld by the supreme court In the notable cases re cently before that body?
