GRANTS PASS, ORE., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1910 OUR CHRISTMAS GREETING Keeping abreast of the times, The Courier is issuini special Christmas number of large proportions, which will be sent to our subscribers as a holiday greeting. Ihis at tractive publication will make known the advantages of Grants Pass as a place to buy everything in the Christmas and general holiday line. We point with pride to the large display of seasonable advertisements and it is with great pleasure we present the up-to-date showing of our mer cantile establishments. This effort to properly observe the Christmas occasion by issuing a high-class number of a newspaper is in keeping with the twentieth century. From start to finish this holiday issue is good and desir able reading and it is quite certain to find a welcome in every home. It should not be forgotten that a week from Sunday is Christmas and that the blessed occasion comes but once a year, so let us make the most of it to gather around the yule log and be merry because it is the glad day on which the Saviour of the world was born. While we are getting ready to celebrate the great day by making presents to our loved ones and friends, let us not forget the poor and the needy, for they have a claim on us. Christ has made our duty plain and commanded us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and remember the unfortunate. would like to show my appreciation of the action of the voters in electing me to tlv Inkiest ottice witnin tne gui of" this municipality, and the only way I can give proof of this fully and satisfactorily is by my action while holding the office. I realize that there is much hard work to be encountered by the next administration, but I feel that there are no obstacles in the way. Of course there is de tail work which must be looked after, but the most im C. 

KIXXEV BOOSTS FOR BETTER COUNTY ROADS H. C. Kinney, who was a dalegate to the good roads convention, was Interviewed by the Telegram and de livered himself of the following booBt for good roads and for Grants Pass: ' H. C. Kinney, of Grants Pass, who - jir.tr. cnnri rfiflrla POT1- portant work to begin with is the fitting up of an office for jvenJtkmf ls one 0f the most prominent the auditor, and police judge, city attorney ana cuy engin eer, as there are many valuable papers, which should be looked after, and therefore must be a place to keep them. Much has been accomplished during the present adminis-. tration, but we have been handicapped by lack of system. Grants Pass is growing and it is quite time that the mat ers mentioned should receive attention. , I am at work on a full spt of recommendations which will be placed before he council at an early day, and until that time 1 do not feel at liberty to follow this subject farther." Mr. Myers understands full well that the office of inayorof Grants Pass for the year 1911 will require much more attention than in any year during the past. It is pleasing to note that he is disposed to be conservative in all city matters and, David Crockett like, he will be very ikely to be sure he is right before he goes ahead. 

STATE ROAD COMMISSIONER TO BE APPOINTED L. R. Webster, of the Good Roads Association of Ore gon, is hard at work with some of his associates drafting a bill creating a state highway commission. Under the new order of road building in Oregon this is a very im portant matter and it will command the best efforts on the part of the legislature. The bill is to provide for the appointment of a high way commission of three members who shall receive no pay. Their term of office shall be for two, three and four years each. The first function of the commission will be to appoint a state highway commissioner, who will have supervision of the construction of all state roads as well as all roads where crushed rock and gravel are used. The salary of the commissioner is fixed in the bill at $4000 a year, and provision is made that he must be an ex pert in road construction. He will be allowed a clerk at $150 a month. The commissioner will be required to report to the legislature at each session with statistics on roads and a full account of operations. This bill will be passed on by the Good Roads conven tion, after which it will be ready for presentation at the opening session of the legislature. The Good Roads Asso ciatiou of Oregon has been doing a wonderful work for the people and it is itlcasincr to note that it has been appre ciated. The great public need has long been a better knowledge of road construction. County courts have, of course, done the best they could, but not being experts it was to be expected that thev would make occasional mis takes. A state highway commissioner who will have sup ervision of all roads where crushed rock and crave! arc used will be a step in the right direction and will assis great lv in the securing of permanent roads. We must al admit that knowledge is power and in road building this applies with groat iorce, as it will enable us to secure bet ter results than could be obtained without this important aid. If we can have each year a few miles of permanent JOSEPHINE COUNTY MUST LEAD The good roads convention held in Portland last Mon day, was without exception the most representative, the most important and the most popular gathering that has ever taken place in the state. Every county wTas repre sented and there seem to be able men in every delegation. Oregon has long been preparing for just such a meeting and if the legislature will complete the work started by the convention every county, we believe, will act promptly and inaugurate the construction of permanent roads. The courier has plead with the county court for years for the construction of one mile, or even a half a mile, of perman ent road in order that we might have an object lesson such as the city of Grants Pass has given in its bitulithic pave ment; but the court could not see its way clear to do this and so the matter has remained until the late election, when all candidates nominated were placed on a good roads platform. H. C. Kinney, of this city, said at the convention that the county court of Josephine county could be depended upon to inaugurate the good roads movement. Let us hope that he is not mistaken and that promptness will be the very essence of the work the court has in hand. It is the solemn duty of every citizen to assist in this matter. Even the starting of the work will attract to us the home seeker and the investor and, therefore, this part of the Rogue river valley should be foremost in the construction of per manent roads. i The preliminary work to be undertaken is in the legis lature and it is the duty of. the people of the county to in struct our members to assist in the passage of the laws recommended by the good roads convention. The Jose phine county members must be instructed to act with energy that the people of the state and of the whole coun try, for that matter, may know that Josephine count) 1 J 1 A V V 1 ft I il i sianas ior tnat nigner type oi civilization mat comes through the good roads movement. The commercial club of Grants Pass must be induced to assist not only the "legislature but the county court in carrying forward this seemingly new idea of permanent road construction, which is, after all, 3000 years old. Few of us would have thought that Oregon was that many years behind the times, and yet there is abundant proof that it is so. But, thank God, the eleventh year in the new century will be the dawn of better things, which will place every county in this state in the van of the permanent road building. citizens of Josephine county, and for manv years he has been foremost in every work which has been started for the upbuilding of southern Ore gon. For more than a quarter of a century he has been a buslnss man of Grants Pass and has for the last few' years been active in securing for that section the benefits of irri gation, he being a director in the Josephine County Irrigation and Power company. He has seen Grants Pass grow from a hamlet of a few houses to a bustling city of 5000 people. Mr. Kinney said he and the other delegates from Josephine county had done what they could in the conven tion to help the good roads move ment and that they will go home well pleased with what was accomplished. Our county gave a substantial majority, for the amendment to the constitution and I believe if the leg islature will pass the bills' recom mended by the convention there will be no difficulty in bonding Josephine county in the Interest of good roads. The county court was elected on a good roads platform and If the means are available I feel quite sure cf the result. "We hope this year to have our Irrigation matters in such shape as greatly to benefit not only the farm ers of the vicinity, but the business men of the city of Grants Pass. Whenever we get the water on the lands adjoining Rogue river as it is one either side of the Applegate river and a portion of the Illinois valley, we will develop not only the fruit industry, but we will have the best agricultural section in the United States.

There arc many em ployes in the various departments of government who have been in their places on moderate salaries for half a century. These clerks have rcallv run their branches of government. They were the men whose services incom ing officeholders could not dispense with and it is a well known fact that they have contributed largely to the honor and glory of our country and should be retired on suitable pensions, thus proving that the American people appreciate the work they have performed for the uaj tional government.
