K5Now iSt the time for everybody, their wives and children, and everybody else to goto Barrett's ad secure Honicthijig cboiee for Christmas and Now Year's presents. Barrett has the stock from which all can be uited. So let all, both grave and gay, good looking and ugly, call and be suited. tSyThe President's Message occupies the larger portion of our first pugo. It is Lip. colnish all over. The object of the war is fully explained freeing all the negroes in the Union. Notwithstanding its many de fects, it has one good recommendation -brevity.

Mr. Chase is tbe ablest man in the Abolition party, but we fear ho is too much of a poli tician to be altogether the most suitable man for that high andiuiportant judicial position. We trust we may be mistaken. JSPBf. Hatton, when the call waa first issued by th Governor for the people to contribute to the relief of soldier' families. tried in hid usual way to make a political af- .fajr out of it, thiulting that hisLoyal League brethren would come up manfully to the work; but being disappointed in all srch foolish expectation he now regards' the n- mount contributed as ''discreditable to our cttisens." He should have-said " "Loyal Atfaguers . iosad pf "citwens.''. vj V - Such .a humane, and worthy objeot as eou' -tributingtb the" re'lief of Soldier's Families, should not be made a political affair; and no .One but a demagogue would engage 'iu' that kind of business.

The Township Trustees of each Township in Harrison County, should see to it imme diately, that the cnrollniont of their Town ; nronerlv corrected. And a big ef fort should also be made to have each Town fillpJ bv rolunteers before the draft is ordered.
