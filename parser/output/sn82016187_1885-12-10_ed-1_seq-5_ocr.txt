--V -4'l,?t5"', trZ.Vr -? W& THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE: WASEISaTOND. 0., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1885, WASHINGTON GOSSIP, m The Week's Doings at the Na tional Capital ornNTNTJ of tiie 49rn congress. On Saturday, preliminary to tho work of or ganizing the two Houses of Congress, both par tics held their caucuses to select candidates for tho various oliiccs. The Itspublicans havo a good working majority in the Senato and tho Doraocrats in the House, so that nominations in each case were equivalent to an election. The minority always presents as its candidates, however, men whom it delights to honor. The Republican Senators selected Hon. John Shcrman.of Ohio, for President jjfOcm)oreof tho Senate. He received the unanimous vote. In accepting the honor Mr. Sherman said: Senators, I return to you my hearty thanks for the high honor you propose to confer upon me. Your elioiee.'no doubt, has been influenced by the fact that 1 lmvo long been n inuinlcr of the Senate. Still my duties hilhero have not given me the prac tical experience necessary for n good presiding offi cer. I can only jay in accepting the position as signed me that 1 will do all I can, fairly and impar tially, to observe and enforce the rules of the Sen ntc, and shall rely greatly upon your forbearance and courtesy. There were no other officers to be nominated for the Senate, ns the Secretary, Sergcant-at-Anns, etc., hold their positions continuously until removed for cause or iu consequence of a change biought about by the whirligig of poli tics. The Democratic Senators chose as their can didate Hon. Isham G. Harris, of Tennessee. In the Democratic House caucus Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, was renominated for Speaker. There was no opposition, and ho was chosen by acclamation. Mr. Carlisle mado a brief speech, in which he said: It is scarcely necessary for me to say how highly I appreciate the compliment you have just paid me, or how much 1 thank you for it. A unanimous nomination for the office of Speaker of the House of Hepivtculatives by .so large a body of Represent ative Democrats from all parts of the country, is an honor which 1 do not pretend to deserve on account of my services in the past, but which I shall ear neatly endeavor to show my appreciation of by a faithful icrformancc of official duties in the future. Leedoni, of Ohio, for Sergeant-at-Arms; Clark, of Missouri, for Clerk, and Dal ton, of Indiana, for Postmaster, were renominated, they having held these positions in the last Con gress. For Doorkeeper, Samuel Donelson, of Tennessee, was nominated. Wintersmith, of Texas, held this office in tho last House. Ho died during the recess. The name of John 13. Trainor, of New York, was entered against Donelson, but was withdrawn after it was seen that ho had " no show." Gen. Coit, of Connecti cut, and Comrade Reader, of Pennsylvania, both badly-crippled veterans, aud the latter having but one arm, were candidates for this position, but did not receive enough encourage ment to justify tho presentation of their names to the caucus. The only real contest was over the Chaplain. It may be regarded a hopeful sign that tho Congressmen manifested so much earnestness and anxiety in selecting the best talent possible to pray for them daily aud look after their spiritual interests. They appeared to fully realize their lost aud ruined condition. Tho candidates were Rev. J. S. Lindsey the Chap laiu of the last House and Rev. J. L. Lodge, of Washington, and Rev. W. H. Milbum, tho celebrated "Blind Preacher," of Chicago. Af ter an animated contest Mr. Milburn was nominated. The Republicans of the nouse nominated for Speaker Thomas 13. Reed, of Maine, who re ceived 63 votes to 47 for Frank Hiscock, of New York. Other candidates were chosen, as ibllows: Clerk, Col. YV. O. Crosbie, of Iowa; Sergeaut-at-Arms, Capt. Albert O. Marsh, of Indiana; Doorkeeper, Col. Joseph Seldeu, of Connecticut; Postmaster, A. W. Adams, of Maryland ; Chaplain, Rev. Dr. F. L. Britt, of Nebraska. All the caucuses of both parties declared in favor of immediate action by Congress to de termine the vexed question of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential succession. The general sentiment favors the bill introduced in the 4Sth Congress by Senator Hoar, of Massachu setts. It confers the succession to the Presi dency, in case of vacancy in the offices of Presi dent and Vice-President, upon tho Secretary of State, or if that office is vacant, then upon the Secretary of the Treasury, the succession pass ing to the otiier members of the Cabinet in turn. The electoral count bill, also to be intro duced by order of the Republican caucus, is that known as the Edmunds bill, of the last Con gress. Its most important feature is a provis ion that each State may, by its own tribunals, determine all controversies with regard to its own electoral vote. Congress convened at noon on Monday. Long before the hour for the opening a multitude of people thronged the galleries and jammed the doorways of both Senate and House, while the tide of those who could not gefc in at all ebbed and flowed through the lobbies and long cor ridors. Upon the desks of many of the mem bers were beautiful floral tributes. Precisely at 12 o'clock tiie gavel fell iu both of the great assembly halls. In the Senate the chair lately occupied by Mr. Hendricks and tho walls of the chamber were heavily draped in mourn ing, and a feeling of solemnity seemed to pervade the entire assemblage. Tho proceed ings were very brief. After the opening prayer Senator Sherman was elected President j)ro tempore. After the oath was administered to Senators Logan, of Illinois, and Blair, of New Hampshire, and a few minor items of business, resolutions were adopted commemorative of tiie late Vice-President, and tiie Senate then ad journed till Tuesday, as a mark of respect to his memory. In the House Mr. Carlisle was elected Speaker, and, amidst great applause, in which the Re publican members heartily joined, was escorted to the chair which he filled so acceptably dur ing the last Congress. The oath of office was administered to him by the venerable Judge Keliey, of Pennsylvania. The members were then sworn by tho Speaker, after which the subordinate officers were elected, in accordance with the nominations of tho Democratic cau cus. It was then decided to -proceed with tho drawing for seats, the usual custom being to defer this till the second day. Mr. Bennett, of North Carolina, started off with an ungraceful act When the drawing for seats was ordered, Mr. Mills, Democrat, of Texas, arose and asked unanimous consent that Judge Keliey, "Father of the House," be permitted to chooso his ecat. This courtesy has been extended to him for several years, by reason of his age and infirmi ties, as well as to others for similar reasons. Mr. Bennett objected, amidst many signs of disapproval from both sides of the House. Mr. Reed, of Maine, said that Mr. Keliey would be allowed by his Republican colleagues to chooso any scat he desired on their side of the House regardless of tho result of the draw ing, and was warmly applauded by the Repub licans. Mr. Reed thereupon suggested that .Mr. Keliey leave his hat upon his desk, and assured him that bis wish would be respected. The hat was respected, and although Judge Kellcy's name was ono of the last drawn he secured his old scat, by tho center aisle, four or five rows from the front. This completed the organization, and the House thereupon adjourned till Tuesday, for tho same reason that induced similar action on tho part of tiie Senate. The President's message was not sent to tho Capitol till Tuesday. new chiefs of division. Mr. A. A. Aspinwall, of Titusville, Pa., the newly-appointed Chief of the Western Division of the Pension Bureau, enlisted in April, 1S61, at the age of 1G years, in the 33d N. Y., aud served until it was mustered out of tho service. Since the war Mr. Aspinwall lias held the re sponsible positiou of Secretary and manager of the Gibbs & Sterrit Manufacturing Company, of Titusville, and brings to his new position business qualifications of a high order. Col. W. P. Davis, of Danville, III., who now holds the position of Chief of the Middle Di vision, was mustered in as a private, at New Albany, of tho 23d Ind.; wasthen elected Captain; afterwards commissioned as Major, and finally promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. He commanded tho regiment two out of the three years of its existence, aud acted as its Colonel in all the engagements it participated in with the exception of the batUo of Shiloh. Col. Davis was mustered out of service with his regiment iu front of Atlanta, and since that time has occupied the position of manager of the Grape Creek Coal &. Coko Co., of Dau Tillc, HI. COMMODOnn lowndes dying. Commodore Charles Lowndes, U. S. N., is lying at the point of death at his home iu Talbot Co., Md. lie is 8G years of ago; was ap pointed a Midshipman in i'oio, aud placed on the retired list in lbGl. IN 

MOURNING FOR MR. HENDRICKS. The intelligence of tho sudden death of Vico President Hendricks at Indianapolis created a profound sensation in Washington. It was so wholly unexpected that it was at first re ceived with universal doubt of its authenticity. Numerous privato telegrams, however, soon confirmed the tidings. Expressions of grief and regret were heard on every hand, not only from members of his own party, but from Republi cans as woll, for, outside of politics, Mr. Hen dricks had many personal friends among the latter. Tho news was a severe shock to the President. Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Cleveland had never met until their names were coupled on tho national ticket last year. Pleasant aud cor dial personal relations were immediately es tablished between them, and coutinucd up to tho present time. Each had sincere esteem and respect for tho other, although thoyhad honest differences of opinion on some questions, notably that of civil service reform. Mr. Cleveland has shown too much political flexi bility to suit tho rock-ribbed partisanship of Mr. Hendricks. Tho latter was a Democrat of tho old school, who clung to tho faith of the fathers of the party. Ho made no secret of his disagreement with the President in the matter of turning the Republicans out and appointing Democrats in their places. Tho public buildings havo been draped in mourning, iu accordance with tho usual custom, aud flags everywhere are at half mast. Sev eral members of tho Cabinet, as well as many other prominent men at tho Capital, attended tho funeral at Indianapolis. Special trains were run from Washington for tho convenience of those who wished to be present. Few men were bettor known in Washington than Mr. Hendricks. He has been prominent in politics and in public lifo for more than 30 years, and much of that time his official station has been here. His privato lifo wa3 blameless, and his kindliness of heart had endeared to him a largo circle of personal friends. Four Presidents and four Vice-Presidents have died while in office. Tho former were William Henry Harrison, April 4, 1811 ; Zach arv Tavlor, July 9, 1S50; Abraham Lincoln, April 15, 1SG5; "James A. Garfield, Sept. 19, 1S31. The Vice-Presidents were: Elbridgo Gcrrv, Nov. 23, 1814; William R. King, April 18, 1853; Henry Wilson, Nov. 22, 1875; Thomas A. Hendricks, Nov. 25, 1835. 

DEPARTMENT K AGRICULTURE. Hon. N. J. Co4 cr of Agri culture, has submitrctrhrs-nirnu,.! .iporfc to tho President. Ho says that tho year, which opened in gloom over the threatened destruction of tho Winter crops by frost, closes with bright pros pects of abundance for man and beast, produced, too, at a cost which is not a burden to tho pro ducer, and to be sold at a price which is not a barrier to tho poor consumer. Ho reviews the work of the various bureaus, showing tho results attained by each aud tho future operations mapped out. A change in the method of distributing seeds is suggested, by which they shall only be sent to such cul tivators as comply with a few simple aud easy requirements, thus insuring the greatest good to the largest number. "In conclusion," he says, "I beg to represent that the Department of Agriculturo, growing iu importance aud usefulness as our agricultural population increases and its wants and neces sities multiply, should obviously bo a progres sive institution in order to keep pace with tho increasing demauds made upon it. It is for the legislative branch to determine how far tho importance shall bo recognized, and with what powers it shall be clothed to enable it to par tially meet the obligation which a country al ways owes to its agriculture." 

TIIEY "WANT HIS HEAD. The members of the Jefferson Democratic Association of Washington havo taken fresh courage since the November elections, and have put their shoulders to the wheel, under the im pression that the President will set the political guillotine in motion. They have filed formal charges agaiust E. O. Graves, Chief of tho Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Tho charges are to the effect that ho has been guilty of offensive partisanship, favoritism and gen eral iniquity. Mr. Graves will probably bo surprised to find what a very bad man he is. Ho is ono of those offensive partisan Republi cans known as the roviled and despised Mug wumps, who voted for Cleveland aud who re fuses to bo governed by political considerations iu the administration of the affairs of his bu reau. Mr. Graves is conceded one of the best bureau officers of tho Treasury. The Bureau of Engraving aud Printing, however, employs a largo number of persons. It is outside of the civil service rules aud is a tempting prize for the politicians. A NEW 

MARSHAL. Last week President Cleveland appointed A. A. Wilson, of Washington, Marshal of tho District of Columbia, in placo of Col. Clay ton McMichacl, who was appointed by President Arthur. Col. McMichacl teudered his resigna tion soon after Mr. Cleveland's inauguration, but hasremainod in office at the latter's request. He has discharged his official duties in a pre eminently satisfactory manner, and retires with tho esteem of all who have had relations with him. Mr. Wilson was born in Washing ton in 1810, and has been for many years con nected with various local business enterprises. He is a Democrat in politics. Tho appointment is universally commended. A 

RULE THAT HAS EXCEPTIONS. "I don't understand," said a Western Demo cratic Senator the other day, " what the Admin istration means by removing Gen. Huidekoper from the Philadelphia Post-office. I expect there will be a bitter fight mado against tho confirmation of his successor. What I mean when I say that I don't understand it, is that it is not iu accordanco with my experience of the polic3T of tho Post-Office Department. A Representative from my State had recommend ed the removal of a Postmaster in his district. This man's friends appealed to me and I repre sented the caso to Mr. Vilas. The Postmaster had been a Color-Sergeant in the Union army and had his leg shot oil' while at tho head of his troop. Besides his small salary as Postmaster he had only his pension to keep his wife and three children with. Upon my representing this condition of things to Mr. Vilas, ho at onco ordered his retention, saying that there were no such places for Democrats." GEN. SCHOKIELD WANTS MORE SOLDIERS. Maj.-Gen.Schofield, commanding the Division of the Missouri, says in his annual report that his forces, in round numbers, consist of 9,500 infantry, 5,G00 cavalry, and 330 artillery, aggre gating 15,000. They occupy G5 different sta tions, giving an average of 231 men at each. Ho has the following to say about the means necessary to prevent great destruction of life and property by savage Indians: "Tho Indians arc well mounted, having several ponies to each man, well armed, and abundautly supplied with ammunition. Being trained from early child hood, they are excellent horsemen and expert marksmen, equal in theso respects to the best Regular troops in tho world. It is manifestly impossible to permanently overawe and hold in subjection such bodies of savages by tho show of any force far inferior to them in numbers." THE RATTLE OF FORT STEVENS. Maj. J. H. Stino, historian of the First Corps, accompanined by soveral other officers, last week inspected the battlefield of Fort Stevens, just north of the city, which point was reached by the Confederate advance in 1SG4, when Gen. Early bivouacked his army almost in the sub urbs of Washington. It is proposed there shall bo a Reunion next Summer of ail tho soldiers, on both sides, engaged in that affair, to which Gen. Early will be specialty invited. Maj. Stme is reported as saying that but for tho largo amount of oxcellont liquor tho Confeder ates found and drank in tho cellar of a house near the place referred to, thoy would almost certainly have entered tho city, and that he believes some of them actually did so. CONCERNING THE ARMY. Tho annual report of the Secretary of War shows that tho expenditures for the past fiscal year were $-15,850,999.51. Tho estimates for the year ending June 30, 18SG, amount to $18, 201,103.48. Tho estimates for salaries and con tingent expenses for 18d7are less than the appropriations for tho present year, and tho Secretary hopes that the changes recommended, which aro deemed to be for tho best interests of the service, may bo favorably considered. In regard to the promotions to the grade of Major and Lieutenant-Colonel, aud to maintain the efficiency of a command, the suggestions of the Adjutant-General are adopted, as follows: "On tho happening of a vacancy the officer entitled to promotion should be commissioned as 'Major of Infautry,' Lieutenant-Colonel of Artillery,' etc., ns the caso may be, instead of, as at prueent, 'Major of tho regiment of in fantry,' etc. The effect of the proposed change will be to enable the Licutcuaut-Gciioral of tho Army to assign officers of the line to the partic ular regiment of tho same arm iu which their services may be of tho greatest benefit, looking ! to the highest efficiency of the regiment. This, it is believed, would eradicate an evil which at auy timo may, through disgust or despair, threaten the demoralization of a regi ment otherwise possessed of material able aud willing to sustain its reputation." In speaking of tho troops it is said that, hav ing made rapid progress in target practice, skirmish firing has been introduced, and figures of mon so arranged as to represent a hostile line of skirmishers have been substituted for the target. Gratifying results arc anticipated when tho system is fully inaugurated. Desertions in the army during the past year have greatly diminished, but it is difficult to adjudge an adequate punishment where a man has deserted soveral times. In a caso occurring recently tho recruit had previously deserted six times. The matter ought to bo brought to the attention of Congress, in order thatapropor punishment may be provided. Of the Military Academy at "West Point, it is stated that $315,853.50 was appropriated for this institution for tho fiscal year 18S5, and $290,712.17 expended. There were present Sept. 1, 1835, 313 Gidets, and the tone and dis cipline of the corps leaves little or nothing to bo desired. Tho total number of officers for duty at tho post, including eight Professors and two Surgeons, is 53. Tho class which graduates in June next numbers 78, aud in caso vacan cies in the army aro not sufficient to pro vide for all the graduates, it is recommended that legislation bo taken authorizing tho re tention of those electing to serve as additional Second Lieutenants. AN 

EFFICIENT OFFICER. Gen. Charles M. Shelloy, Fourth Auditor of the Treasury, is ono of the officers of the new Administration making a brilliant record, though tho fact would not havo bocn made public had not tho information upon which it is based been obtained from other than strictly official sources; as the ouly distinction tho General has been at all desirous of obtaining is that tho work of his offico should be observed and appreciated by tho Secretary of the Treas ury. In his annual report, recently mado to tho Secretary of tho Treasury, tho Auditor says: There aro indications that the loss to the Govern ment through the misapplication of public prop erty equals that resulting from the improper dis bursement of money. To correct this, so far as tho Navy Department ia concerned, the law should provide for n system of naval property account ability similar to that now provided for tho Quar termaster's aud Commissary Departments of the Army. The adjustment of tho accounts should be imposed upon the accounting officers of the Treasury on tho same consideration- of independ ence and uniformity which gave them the super vision of the money accounts of the Navy Depart ment. I find in the expenditures under tho appropria tion for tho expenses of the Board of Visitors to the Navnl Academy that apparently unnecessary expenses are incurred. I respectfully recommend that the allowance bo fixed, as in tho caso of tho Board of Visitors to tho Military Academy by tho act approved June 11, 1878 (Stats, at Large, vol. 20, page 110), viz., mileage at eight cents per mile aud $3 per diem for expenses during each day of serv ice at tho Acadomy, thus securing uniformity of compensation. The last recommendation is a most excellent one, as tho editor is awaro from personal knowledge that tho large sum of $2,500 annu ally appropriated by Congress to pay tho ex penses of the "Board of Visitors," composed of not more than six persons, who aro engaged for less than that number of days, if not spent in rioioiis living ly the "Hoard," is expended in a sufficiency of articles liquids and solids to give the entire Academy "a big spree." Gen. Shelloy, who is a citizen of Selma, Ala., was born in Sullivan County, Tcnn., Dec. 23, 1833; removed to Alabama with his father iu 1836; was brought up to the trade of an archi tect and builder, and has siuco followed that busiucss; he entered the Confederate sorvico in February, 1861, as Lieutenant, and was sta tioned at Fort Morgan, and was afterward at tached to the 5th Ala.; after furthor sorvico he was commissioned Brigadier-General, aud served under Gens. Joseph E. Johnston and Hood; after the war ho returned to his occupa tion, and has since been a leader in groat and good works for the advancement of tho interests of his adopted State. Ho was a Member of tho 15th aud 46th Congresses, and received a certifi cate of re-election to the 47th Congress. Ho was unseated July 20, 1832, and the seat having been declared vacant he was rcchoscn to it as a Democrat, Nov. 7, 1SS2. Those who havo business with his offico aro shown every courtesy, and it is tho General's intention that all citizens, or sailors, from tho "Jack-o'-the-dust" to tho Admiral, who havo mouoy duo them to bo obtained through his office shall reap the benefit thereof with as little delay and trouble as possible As wo havo before said, wo shall always and at all times bo ready to commend tho officers of tho present Administration who conduct their offices in tho interest of tho general pub lic, but more especially those who were soldiers themselves, aud are alive to the interests of the " soldiers and sailors of tho late war." Gen. Shelley is ably assisted in his efforts by his new Chiefs of Division, Mr. James M. Wright and Mr. Erwin, who were both Confed erate soldiers. Mr. Erwin was badly wounded and wears a crutch.

The War Dcpartnjont -has recently received such reports from its. otlicials in Utah regarding the very unscttlod condition of affairs in that Territory, as to cau30 some unoasincss, but no alarm. There has,bcoo( much ill feeling in consequence of the enforcement of the laws against polygamy, hut tho immediate cause of the present trouble was the shooting of tho Mormon McMurrin by a United States Marshal. Gen. Schofield saidjat Chicago, on Mouday: ".While I am not atliborty to givo any details regarding tho movement of troops that is at tracting attention, jTam'frco to say that there is not tho slightcst.dangor from any outbreak of the Mormons in Salt Lake City that tho War Department will not bo able to cope with. Tho Government troops-, at .Salt Lake are amply sufficient to protect tho city and tho Govern ment No Mormon mob could cope with our well-trained sharpshooters already there. It is always best, however, in the opinion of the War Department, to anticipate any possible dis turbance and prevent it, rather than wait until after tho trouble comes." A dispatch from Salt Lake City, dated Mon day, says: "Battery D, 5th Art, arrived hero at 11 o'clock a. m. to-day. Five companies from Fort Douglas waited for them at tho de pot and escorted them to camp thrco miles dis tant this afternoon. A blinding snow storm prevailed all day, but the military display at tracted great crowds, who stood sullenly by without a sign. As the band reached the cor ner of Templo Bock it struck up a lively air, which continued till it had passed that and tho Tithing Block. Gen. McCook and staff were at tho head of the column, tho flai$s flying and tho magnificent nccouterments of tho battery made a grand sight. Tho battery comprises four guns and 70 men under Maj. Bawles.

RECENT LITERATURE. A CAPTIVE OF LOVE. A JAPANESE RO MANCE. Translated by Edward Gieey. author of "The Golden Lotus," "Young Americans in Japan." "The Wonderful City of Tokio," "The Bear-Worshipers of Yezo." and one of the trans lators of "Tito Loyal ltonins." Published by Lee & Shepard, Boston, Mass. Price 1.50. Nothing could bo more delightfully quaint than Mr. Groey's translations of the muster pieces of Japanese fiction. His first book, "Tho Loyal Roniiis," appeared some years ago, entirely unheralded by the press, and at first excited no more than ordinary attention from tho reading public. But one after anothor into whose hands it fell wero so charmed with it, aud so eloquent as to its merits, that it had a continually increasing sale, and to-day is one of the most often-called for books iu the market. Tho present book is even more interesting in some ways. It is a literal translation of ono of tho famous Japanese novels of 500 years ago, and gives such u picturo of the lives, modes of thought, customs aud superstitions of those wonderful islanders, as they might get of old Scotland by reading a literal translation into Japanese of one of tho Wavcrly Novels. Tho story opens with a bad huntor, who follows the sinful business (in Buddii'it oj'cs) of chasing and killing tho animals V7 the forest. His pious wife in vain tries to persuade him to re linquish his vicious practice, but ho comes homo to tell her how, by imitating a holy re cluse, he decoyed witiiiu reach of his bow, aud slow tho wonderful " Door-of-Fivo-Colors," which he has long hunted in vain. The poor womnn died iu an agony of remorse, but before doing so besought hor husband to expiato his offense by bringing up tiieir boy as a priest. This was done, and the boy becamo a prodigy of learning and piety, and seemed about to re deem tho souls of his parents, when, in an ovil hour, ho yielded to his passions aud tho seduc tions of u minstrel girl nnd committed a mor tal sin. Then troubles of all kinds eusuo, and a story full of incident is related. These iliustrato Japanese ideas as no formal description of tho country possibly could. For example, the hunter's sin in slaying tho sacred Dcer-of-Fi ve-Colors, not ouly sends himself, wife and sou to dishonorablo graves, but in a mys terious way it makes tho two soldiers who bought tho hide become cowards in battle, and after leading lives of wretchedness dio miser ably. It causes tho hunter's sou to fall from grace and becomo an ovil man, passing through a series of interesting but criminal perform ances before justice finally overtakes him. Tho sacred duty of children to avenge their parents is taught by stern oxamplo, and pecuuiary honesty is held up as a soveroign virtue Tho characteristic phrases of the Japaneso language are roproduced literally. Tims, when a mau dies, ho is tisai d jto " travel tho lonely road" or "change jiis world"; when he runs away ho " eats the wind.'! Tho story is charm ingly told, the illustrations are from tho origi nal pictures, aud no one who lias tho slightest interest in tho people and civilization of that fascinating Land oftthe Morning Suu can a (lord to miss reading it.

John McNeil to Major. Both of theso ore veterans. On tho evening of Dec. 1, Chevalier Bayard Commandery of Knights Templar, of Chicago, gave a grand complimentary banquet to Gen. John A. Logan, in honor of his initiation into tho order. There was a genial (low of speech-making:, and the occasion was one of unusual pleasure and interest. Col. Clayton McMichael, who lias just retired from the oflice of United Stated Marshal of tho District of Columbia, will return to his former home in Philadelphia and resume the manage ment of the North American newspaper, iu which lie is interested. Col. John S.Williams, Third Auditorof the Treas ury, lias dono what is not only a just, but a very graceful thing, in restoring to his position Capt. A. J. Hiintoon, who was removed sonic weeks since. Capt. Huntoon served in tite 12th N. H nnd made an excellent record, until wounds received at Chatta nooga compelled his retirement from the service. He has mado a good record in the Treasury De partment, where he had become a third-class clerk ur.il Chief of a section. When the facts connected with his career were pioperly presented to Col. Williams, that gentleman promptly recognized their vnluoand restored Capt. Huntoon to bis po sition. An effort is being made by the politicians to so cure the removal of T. B. Norris from his position as Postmaster at Springville, N. Y. Comrade Nor ris served throtigh the war in tho 116th N. Y. Ho was one of the storming party in the assault on Port Hudson, La., and received a gunshot wound in the face, front the effects of which he lost tho sight of his right eye Jan. 7, 1831, bo was appointed Postmaster for four years.

Alexander Shaler, commanding the First Division, National Guard of New York, and holding important civil positions in that city, was arrested last week on tho charge of accepting a bribe. As Secretary of the Armory Board he was deputized to purchase real estate for the Board, aud it is alleged that he received $0,000 as an inducement to purchase a certain piece of property, for which an exorbitant price was paid. Gen. Slmler was taken before the grand jury and an indictment was returned against him. He was released on bail pending trial. F. Khien. of the oldGth Vt and a member of Post No. 37, Spencer, Mass., passed through Washington last week from Jacksonville, Fla., whither he had been tosccuro tho body of a sou of one of the com rade of hia Post who died there. He met a cordial reception from the com Hides residing in Jackson ville, and waa much pleased with the evidences of fraternity which he found there. Gen. Coster, Pension Agent at Now York, has re signed. It is understood, however, that ho will remain in office until the December pension pay ments have been made. The position pays $1,000 per year, and there are already half a dozen appli cants for it. The resignation of Col. W. R. Smcdbcrg, com manding the 2d Artillery Kegitncnt, National Guard of California, has been accepted. The Commander-in-Chief expresses regrets in orders at tho loss to the National Guard of this experienced and highly capable ofliccr. Comrade Fred. H. Wildrlck, commander of Post No. 50, G.A.K., Department of New Jersey, is a candidate for Postmaster at Phillipsburg.N. J. Ho was honorably discharged from the army ufter long and faithful service. He is supported for tho posi tion by all his Post comrades and many business men and others. Maj. W. W. Alcorn, late Adjutant-General of tho Grand Army of the Beptiblic, was tendered tho po sition of Assistant Adjutant-General of Ohio by Gov.-cleet Foraker, but dcclitTcd the appointment. Col. Win. E. McLean, the First Deputy Com missioner of Pensions, is n phenomenal mau in one respect. at least. We presume that be is the only living Colonel and probably only Colonel that overdid livo who has escaped promotion to "Gen eral" since tho war. When it is remembered that he actually commanded a brigade for a longtime, the singularity gets to bo as wonderful as Bamuui's Jumbo. Gen. Geo. n. Sheridan is preparing an address on Gen. Grunt, to be delivered before the Grand Army Posts of the country. Comrade Chas. E. Coon, who made so efficient an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury that the new Administration would not let him go for months after it came into power, boa been visiting Washington for a few days. He is now residing in New York, taking about the first rest he has had since leaving the army. He has not yet decided what business he will engage in. Lieut. Thomas C. McLean, U. S. N., of Baltimore, has been detached from the Brooklyn and ordered to the" Dolphin. Gen. John F. Miller, Senator from California, is improving in health, and hopes to be able to take his scat iu the Senate after the holidays. The disturbance in the Pension Ofliec in Boston has finally resulted in the removal of Dr. A.Gaston Iloctb from tho Board of Examiners, and the ap pointment of Dr. Morton Prince. Capt. J. C. Burrows, of Michigan, who was a leading member of the 17th Congress, reappears upon the assembling of the 19th. There will be no more prominent man on the Republican tiide dur ing the cxeitingsccnes that will undoubtedly follow nsnooii as the great political parties lock horns upon the issues of the hour.
