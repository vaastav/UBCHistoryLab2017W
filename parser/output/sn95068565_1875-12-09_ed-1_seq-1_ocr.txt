SuntiiTAHY IIiuhtow bus closed a con tract with the Hyiiilicatis for taking the whole of tho remainder of .!0(),000,(lili) live per cents. The (Secretary will take no action in regard to disposing of the lour or four and a half per cent, until congress meets. VALM.vsr.lu'n latest order presents an inlcrestinjr view of life in Culm. He prohibts people fnim traveling at night because they are liable to he shot by the numerous patrols through the. country. As the unfortunate Cubans are afraid to travel around during the daytime for the same reason, the will probably have to utay at home, and rclloel upon tlie'grund eur of Spanish domination. I.v a review of London pauperism re rcutly published, a striking contrast is drawn between the present state of things and that existing sixty years ago. Then the number of persons relieved by the poor rates was eight per cent, of the population. Now it is only three per rent. The population has more than trebled in thai time, yet the number of persons wanting relief remains nearly he same. Tun treasury officials now estimate that the government will recover more than $2,00(1,01)0 from the crooked whisky rases. They at first estimated that only one million five hundred thousand dollars would be recovered. They attribute this success to the evidence directly obtained by the means of the new system of com paring accounts, which was inaugurated by solicitor Wilson, and which led to the detection of the frauds. Ciiikh JirsTK'E Width, of Utah formerly known in Alabama us"llonnic lilue White" has rendered a decision releasing lirigham Young, and demolish ing former decisions of an adverse char acter. White's decision unravels one of the Mormon (iordian knots, and will al low attorney general l'ierrepont to breathe easier. In the meantime, Ann Eliza's chances for alimony are growing smaller and beautifully less. (iliX. Jit HAL K. Kakly, president of the southern historical society, says that this association possesses nearly a com plete set of all the reports printed by the confederate departments, including the president's messages, reports of battles, acts of the confederate congress and state governments, etc. It has also a full set of manuscript reports of (ien. Longstreet's corps, the paors of ( ien. J. K II. Stuart, all of (Ien. Kwell'e reports, a full set of papers of (ien. S. 1). Lee's corps, and many other valuable rctnrts of confederate officers, besides a number of federal official reports. A (HfiASTIc hotel is about to be built in London, with American capital, by an Amcriciin architect, with American speed, after an American plan, and to be managed on the American system. A site not far from tho house of commons. and close to St. James' park, lias been purchased, and it is said that n year hence the first visitor may take up his abode in the new establishment. This hotel will make up 1,000 beds; the dining-room will accommodate 700 persons at the same time, and a stalf of 100 ser vants will be required to carry on the duties of the house. lti'd'NT events in the history of San Francisco more than ever prove the mer curial character not only of its institu tions, but of its people. Sail Francisco lives upon the Nevada mines. The con dition of the mines, therefore, has a great deal of influence upon the business and tcmncr of the people of Sail Francisco. The recent fire in the bonan.as has de- nrnuul Sue. Vrancisco trade. At tlx i - - . ., same time the agricultural enterprises ol the stale are temiering the sensational spirit of tho San Francisco people. There is an undergrowth of business in tho city which does not depend upon the mines, nnl it will supplant tho sensationalism. cuco with the authorities at Washington, iiijuiry has been especially made in relation to 'The Philadelphia University of Medicine and Surgery,' and 'The Livingston University of America' in stitutions, so called of which there are professed agencies in Ismdnn and other English cities. The latter institution never existed, and the charter of the former was revoked in 1872, on account of the issue and sale of sp'-rious diplomas, Tun famous submarine tunnel of the iCnglish channel will soon be begun. The members of the French commission, com posed for the most part of practical men and engineers, declare that an uni.er- groiind communication between France and England is only a iucstioii of ex pense, and their report leads to Hi belief that the project can be carried out will, less exnense. than was at first imagined, and that the danger of leakage .mil infill ration wi not lie so great as was at first supposed.

A bad lot all around, but the worst of them is this Mcgram, wiio willingly made himself a confederate of theirs for five years, and now lictravs all the rest in order to retain his own share of the plunder and keep out of iail.

This shows that Spain has eight "line of battle ships of the first class," while tiic United States have not one. Tlie tonnage of tho navies of tlie two are aliout equal, but that of the United States is largely in amphibious craft for coast defense. Counting our inshore craft and all, Spain lias a quarter more guns than we. As wo have clung to tho cast-iron smooth liores, in which no material improvement lias been made in a century, we can not boast of the su perior power of our guns. I'ut there is one source of consolation: the monitors can not leave our shores, so our defenders can not desert us.
