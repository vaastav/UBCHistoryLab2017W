Hissing.?On Thursday, in the House of Representatives, while Mr. Coehrane, of New Yorlc. was appealing to Mr. Haw? kins, of Florida, to ree^i.o'.dcr his declina? tion to serve on the Committee of 33, he was frequently applauded. Mr. Garnett j-ebulced such demonstrations, when hisses were'heard from the galleiy. Mr. La mar, of Mississippi, said " it was not strange to hear hissing in this House, the same had been heard in Eden." -0 In a letter published in the Richmond Examiner, Senator nunter admits the right of secession, but argues that it shoud take place only when it must be immedi? ate to be a remedy at all; declares Lin? coln's election no cause for disruption, till after the failure of all proper means to preserve a constitutional L^mon; favors a conference of the southern States to agree upon guarantees to bo proposed; and ar? gues that if the Union bo dissolved, the border southern States should unite with the other southern States. Florida is competing nobly for the po? sition of the banner State in tho Southern movement. The unanimous call of the Convention has been followed and en? dorsed by large and unanimous meet? ings in various places; and so far as re? ports have reached us, through exchanges and private correspondence, this State is a unit tor decisive action. Drawn their Pay.?The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald says that the !i members from South Car oliua, Alabama. Georgia and Mississippi drew pay and mileage to this date, which leaves the Treasury without money for similar service to other members." In the vote cast in the General Assem? bly of Georgia for electors to cast the vote Georgia for President and Vice President of the United States, wo find recorded the following : For President of Southern Confederacy, R. Barnwell Rhett. of South Carolina, 1*. For President of Southern United States, Edmund Ruffin, of Vir? ginia, 1. Messrs. Young & Blair, says the Enfau la Spirit of the South, have manufactured at their foundry, in this place, a cannon for a company at Lawrenceville, which answers admirably all the purposes for which artillery is needed. We are proud to record this triumph of home iudnstry and mechanic skill. Lincoln is excessively pleased with the speech of Alex. II. Stephens, of Georgia. He says that the best item of news he had received since the 6th of November was that of Mr. Stephens' election as del? egate to the Georgia State Convention. -?? The Alexandria Sentinel learns that ('apt. John Scott, commanding the fine Black Horse Company, of Fauquier Coun-! ty, Va., has proffered his services to the | Governor of South Carolina. 4

A corcspondonce of the Columbia Guardian, writing from Greenville on the 7th insf., says that a difficulty occurred that day in front of the new Court House, between Mr. J. P., Poole and Mr. E. 0. Jacobs. "A previous personal difficulty having existed between them, Mr. Jacobs apprcached Mr. Poole, drew a pistol, fired several times at him, whereupon Mr. Poole commenced firing, advanced upon Jacobs, and used his pistol over his head." Mr. Jacobs, we learn, died on Friday night from the severe wounds received. The Calhonn Mountaineers. This is the name given to a company of volun? teers recently formed at Fair Tiny, in Pickens Dis? trict. It is commanded by our gallant young friend, Capt. F. W. Kilpatrick. The" hardy mountain boys have always proved useful in times of war, and if this country is destined to be involved in strife and bloodshed, we know of none who will more promply meet the invaders of our section and repel the destroyers of our rights and liberties, than this corps, which bears the name of our illus? trious statesman. That name will never be sullied while in their keeping. -o Hiram Lodge, No. 68, A. F. II. At a regular communication of this Lodge, held on Monday evening.

With two cx-Brigadicr Generals, an ex-Colonel and their late Captain, as officers?mcr.,, too, who would do honor as leaders anywhere?the Cavalry corps at this place may well claim an important '?place in the picture" of our glorioua hereafter. When the tocsin of war is sounded, the Anderson Troop will be.prompt and decided in their re? sponse, by mounting their steeds and setting off for the conflict. That arm of the service is highly estimated, and wc would like to know if there is another corps in the District ready for duty?if | not, they should burnish their blades and prepare at once, for delay is dangerous. -o-__ The Election. The election for delegates to the Convention from this District passed off quiet and orderly. The re? turns from the official statement, will be found iu our columns. From the number of votes given, it will be seen that only about one-half the number of voters exercised their elective privilege, and that something over fifty of those cast wer; not for the regular candidates. For fear of misrepresentation or misconception, we will explain. At one box, 21 tickets were voted " No Separate Si ate Action." At two ethers,"Union"' and "Co-operation" received 3D votes. The co-operatiouists, we believe, must have been misled, for undoubtedly their desires will be met; and therefore, to have voted for any of the genliemeu who were in nominauon, would not have compromised any political principle, nor committed them to extreme action. They were cither misin? formed or led astray from designing motives, and by scheming men. As to the few "Union" votes polled, we have little to say. They accomplish no earthly good, and besides, were cast for defunct matter; the Union no longer exists, only in name, on I that faiut significance will shortly cease. The small vote may be accounted for in several ways. From our knowledge of facts as they exist, it is entirely safe to presume that one-half of those who refrained from voting are in favor of secession, with and without co-operation. The other half wc would not undertake to classify. Some are for the Union, we doubt not, but assuredly nvt all. Now, this was the last contest ever to be decided by South Carolinians in the United States. We assume the fact, that thi3 State will secede_wc have said so for weeks, and gave su ;h a course our hearty endorsement. Let every one, forgetting past differences and burying dead issues, stand prepared to defend her glorious Palmetto colors, and with one exulting shout, exclaim, "Come weal or come woe, we will maintain the future of our beloved Carolina." President Buchanan. This .venerable statesman has delivered his last annual message to the Congress cf the United States. It has been read with sympathy and great indignation, as the reader was pleased to view the last document of that kind which is to emanate from the President under whose administration this once powerful anu glorious Government is to be broken up. We have perused its contents, conned its positions, and studied its anomalous views, with a mingled sympathy and indignation. Its great length precludes our giving any consider? able portion of the Message in this issue; on our fourth page, however, will be found an article sue cintly stating its positions on the great question of the day, and also containing some pithy comments, which will give the reader some idea of what the President has elaborated into enough space to fill our entire outside. No man in the world's history has been required to occupy the unenviable position of Mr. Buchan? an. At the head of a great nation, whose princi? ples of government are based upon republican ideas, where people are sovereign and control their rules through the medium of the ballot-bot?he is compelled to witness the dismemberment of that na? tion, and this, too, ns he closes his labors in the chief magistracy. The thought must be humiliat? ing, and we are moved to sincere pity when we re? flect that such is his inevitable lot. lie is the last of an illustrious line of patriots who have governed this country ; in rising from his official chair, he surrenders it to a man whose election to the office was a base fraud practiced upon two-thirds of the people of these United Slates?who is elected to place and power because he is willing to represent aggressive, unconstitutional and sectional views, which operate against the peace, liberty and pur? suit of happiness of half the governed. This Mr. 

BUCHANAN rightly appreciates, and is only anoth? er cause for him to bow his head in shame and humility. Further?the aged patriot belong.*, by birth and interest to the North. He was elected and has been adhered to by the Southern States, while his own section of country has almost entirely deser? ted him. At this critical period, he has to meet the great issue of disunion, and his dilemma is unbounded?whether to peril all in defending and upholding those who have steadily and firmly sus? tained his administration, and in defending them, maintain what he knows, to be right; or to choose sides with his native section and in behalf of this Union, which, he clearly sees, has run its course and accomplished all it ever can. The mist and fog of unending and perplexing difficulties sur? round him?ho is enveloped in the darkness of tin decision, with no beacon light urging him on, but rather frowning clouds and the mutterings of fast approaching thunder about him. Is it strange, then, that the last Message of the distinguished President, (who is far advanced in years, and who received his political teachings from the very founders of this Government,) should contain so much cause of dissatisfaction to the whole country 1 We think not, and would have been much surprised to find him disclosing views at all satisfactory to either section under existing cir? cumstances. Tho Convention. The State Convention assembles in the city of Columbia on next Monday. Its sentiment will be harmonious ami decided in regard to dissolving the lies thai now unite us with the General Government. We hope its action ami course may prove equally fraternal and united. in our humble judgment, the Convention tuny speedily accomplish the objects for which it is convened, and every member should go prepared to give his aid and influence in perpe? tuating harmony, drowning discord and steering clear of dissensions in this important, solemn and august period of our history as a people. There is no need of delay in framing the ordinance which will declare our separation from the United States. One coui^c only cau be consistently carried out,that is, to persevere in a dignified manner towards se? cession, without regard to the action of other States. It has been declared, almost authorita? tively, that South Carolina will secede at all haz? ards, and it remains for the Convention, when it meets, turning neither to the right nor to the left for counsel or temporizing advice, to redeem the pledges thus made by her leaders and legislators. Any other course will have the effect of bringing upon the State rebukes for indecision and want of confidence, in her cause. On the other band, we do not desire "hot haste'' nor precipitate action.? All discern the importance of South Carolina mov? ing steadily and surely towards deliverance, pre? serving her sclf-rcspcct and boldly asserting her rights as a sovereign State. When she has launch? ed her ship of slate upon the sea of nations, and cut loose her moorings to the present government, then will properly be entertained any propositions from sister slave commonwealths ; then may com? missioners be sent to other Conventions, if deemed necessnry, to urge like action upon their part, and then can site negotiate with all powers in the known world. To do this sooner, will not be wor? thy of her position, and certainly will be regarded as vacillating policy, if not dangerous procrastina? tion of her own action. The Convention, we may remark, will be com? posed of the ablest, most experienced and wisest men in the Stale. A glance at the list of delegates from the various districts and parishes will con? vince any one of the truth of this remark. They know their duly and the weight of responsibility imposed upon them?that duty and that responsi? bility, we feel assured, will be met as intelligent free? men only can, and'the people may safely entrust their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honors with such a body of fearless patriots and states? men. The Legislature. This is the third week of the regular session. Legislators have been industriously engaged in perfecting necessary bills in view of the secession, of this Slate. They have worked unremittingly, and deserve commendation from the people for their assiduity in endeavoring to prepare I hem for any and every emergency that may arise in the next few months or years. Our limited space pre? vents us from giving any synopsis of the proceed? ings, but next week we hope lo publish the impor? tant measures that will pass this session. The election of Governor was gone into on Tues? day. Hons. F. W. Pickkxs, B. J. Johnson, R. P>. Rhktt, Gen. D. F. Jamison, and others, arc the prominent candidates. I The Army Bill passed (he Senate on Saturday by a unanimous vote. It. would come up in the House on Tuesday, Rut wiil doubtless be amended in many particulars. Our friend and Reprcsenlative, Maj. J. V. Moore, has been engaged in the discussion on this Bill, and by his course has gained warm commen? dations from different sections of the Slate. The Bill, as first read, allowed the selection of Regi? mental officers to the Governor; the amendment of the Major gave the election to the volunteers who may be called into service, and who will undoubt? edly want to choose their own leaders. The .Major is right, and those who will be called into the field sustain him heartily in that- cottr?c. "What can our Enemies do ? An argument used in other States against seces? sion is, that the Black Republicans will bo restrain? ed by the Constitution from enacting any laws which will embarass or retard the progress and welfare of the South. In consequence of this, it is contended that we should fight the battle in the Union and endeavor to oust the enemy from place and power. Every reading, thinking man is well assure! that the reins, i.nce in their hands, can never be wrested from the Black Republican grasp?anti-slavery States will claim admission in sufficient numbers, within the next lour years, to forever destroy all hope of defeating this one-idea, sectional band of agitators. They pass into power, and what can they do ? The question receives n pointed, striking and somewhat novel answer in an "Appeal to the South," from the pen of Judge LojtGSTREET, and which wc publish below. Read it, and reflect upon what our enemies have in tlmir hands when Congress is under their control. If they have the power under the Constitution to en? act laws of such fatal character to our interests' what can the South expect from a party sworn 'o trample that instrument under foot ? With the venerable scholar and patriot, whose article is re? ferred to, wc thank God that South Carolina will ncvei be subjected to the degrading position of a State submitting to I lie rule of that arrogant party. The series of articles, by the way. which have appeared in the last few weeks in the Columbia Guardian, from Judge L., have met with an exten? sive re-publication all over the South. Their practical character and the eminent abilities of the author make them attractive and insure a perusal from every reader. We doubt not that they have accomplished much good already in the noble cause of Southern independence. The one which follows is marked for its brevity and cogent argu? ment : Ail Appeal tu tue South.?There is a reason why the Southern Stales should leave the Union' which will satisfy the most abject submissionisls in the South, which 1 would not venture lo suggest, if it were not absolutely certain than South Caroli? na will secede, and were there not strong reasons to believe that at least two other States will follow her 'ixamplc. I would not suggest it. because the Abolitionists have never yet thought of it, and I wem sure the Southern States would remain in the Union. I present it in brief, by itself, lest it should be overlooked in a long article, or be exclud? ed from papers which will not publish longarticlcs. no' matter how important they may be. Do you know, people of the South, that the Black Repub? licans can, by the enactment of one single constitu? tional law, of twelve words, accomplish their aims to the full measure of their wishes ? When I say constitutional law, I mean a law within the letter of Constitution. Here it is: "No products of slave labor shall be exported from the United States." Congress has the power of regulating commerce between the United Slates and foreign nations, Congress did, in 1h(?7. slop (by an embargo) all con.mcrce between this country and foreign na? tions, and that, too, on the motion and votes of Southern men : and that was one of the grievances of the Hartford convcnlionists. Congress may forbid the exportation of particular articles. How would you answer these arguments in support of such a law? Under such a law. what would your cotton, sugar, rice .mi tobacco be worth ? And what would the labor that produces them be worth. Thtsnk God, South Carolina is safe! A. R. Cong 

STREET. -* Gov. V/. H. Gist. This thorough exponent of strict Stale Rights doctrine, being about to retire from the service of South Carolina as her Governor, has addressed a few parting words lo the General Assembly. His duties in the past few month's have been arduous and many, and were it constitutional, we should feel entirely willing that the reins of government might be held by him longer yet. lie has met eve? ry responsibility with manly courage, wisdom and prudence. Wc hope his successor, whoever he may be, will not lower the proud standard of our noble State, nor make a less useful and honored Chicf .Magistrate. The following is the last Message of Gov. Gist, sort in to the Legislature on Friday last, and for which we would ask a perusal: Gentlemen of lite Senate ami II mrc of Representatives: ?Allow me in this my last official communication. ? a farting word. .Soiiih Carolina, after many Inn/? years of earnest but fruitless efforts to arrest the progress of fanaticism, and slay the hand of ag? gression upon her rights by ihe Northern States of tiic Confederacy?after vain remonstrances and solemn assurance that a free people could never submit to inequality and degradation, has at. last determined, with unparrallcled unanimity, to sever the bi n 1, that binds her to those States, an 1 pan company with those that treat her citizens as alien i an.l enemies, rather than friends und brethren. The comparatively small star which represents her on the national banner, and which has hitherto il? lumined the path of the traveler in the search of constitutional liberty, must henceforth quit its ap? pointed place, and must shine only on a banner consecrated to equality, justice and Southern Rights. To permit ii lo remain longer in its pres? ent association, would only dim its lustre, and ulti? mately quench its light. We were told by our great statesman, that the cords of the Union were snapping one by one, and new, the last is broken. Could he have lived to witness our regeneration, he would feel hitusell amply rewarded for all his toils and sacrifices, and would say, like Simeon of old. "Lord, now Idles: thou thy servant depart in peace." A few more days, and the act of secession will be consummated by a solemn ordinance of a Con? vention of the people, and the glad tidings will go forth with lightning speed to every Southern State, to rejoice the hearts and cheer the drooping spirits of millions anxiously awaiting the sequel for a* general deliverance. We have progressed thus far with firm and even*tread?with calmness and deliberation, but with a constancy of purpose not to be shaken by danger or suffering. A single pause, or the least vacillation, and all will be lost. However anxious we may be for co? operation, or however certain we may be of obtain? ing it, let u6 first move ourselves, as the best means of affecting that object; and having closed the door from which wc have passed out of the Union, sc that no insidious devices of the enemy, or false promises of pretended friends can avail to open it then, and not then, may wc with safely seek co-operation, and unite with oilier Stales who have resumed their sovereignty and arc prepared to 'form a more perfect Union, and share with us a common destiny. Every sentinel should remain nt his post, and not relax a fibre until the great work is completed, the great battle fought, and a glorious victory achieved. The delay of the Convention, for a sin g:e week, to pass the ordinance of secession, will have a blighting and chilling influence upon*the action of other Southern Stales, and the opponents of the movement everywhere will be cticourgcd to make another effort to rally their now scattered and disorganized forces, to defeat our action and stay our onward march. Fabius conquered by delay, n:id there crc tho?c of his school, though with n more unworthy purpose, ttlio shrinking from an open and manly attack, use this veil to hide their deformity, and, from a masked battery, discharge their missiles ; but I trust they will striko the ar? mor of truth and fall harmless at our feet, and that by the 25th of December no flag but the Pal? metto will float over any part of Soutli Carolina. It only remains for me to request the appoint? ment of a committee to examine the accounts of the Executive Department, and to inform you that I have no further communication to make. Wx. II.

MACLDIN. for ihr Intelligencer* TO THE VoTKttS OF A.N'DEltSO.N DlSTtttCT: I am informed that reports derogatory to my character as a gentleman arc now being actively circulated in different parts of the District, and as these reports are no doubt intended to affect my standing at the approaching election in January next, I deem it but sheer justice to myself to tliu notice them, and to ask of those who are the au thors of them cither to prove their assertions, or cease the circulation of that which they mu>t know is calculated, just at this time, to do me an injury. I know not who the author of these re? ports are?it is enough for me to know that he is not my friend, and that it is my duty to place my? self right before the people. These reports, ii would seem, fellow-citizens, have been based noon the unworthy oud inglorious part which it i.j alleged that I acted at the calamitous uro which visited the village of Williamson ou ine 70i of November. It was my fortune to be present on that sad occasion, and to witness, for the first time iu my life, the horrors of a town on tire. Amongst other charges, it is alleged that whilst the hotel of my host (Ml-, lt. R. Hudgcnsj was in flames, that his lady begged of me the small favor of assisting her to remove a trunk Com tiic house, but that I actually refused to render her any assistance what? ever. It is also reported that whilst my host was using a!! the efforts iu his power to save ins prop erty, I bat 1 was couiiuuaiiy Uarrassing him about Uiy baggage, Jlid iu.it 1 even attempted to make iiiui \y.\j me lor my own trilling loss. Another re* port nas a thai, during the lire, that Mr. iiarr.ui gave uic t?o siablo key, and requested me to save ins uorsu wmlst looking aiter my own, bot that in? stead of doing so, ilia! i went to the stable, look my honte out, locked lue door, put the key into my pocket and weui off, leaving bis horse and all the oilier slock in ihe stable to the mercy of the [lames. Now, as I am responsible lor what T did do, and not for what 1 did not do, 1 will give you. fellow-citizens, au account of my actions ou thai mght. and then leave you to judge for yourselves. I did not arrive at Williamston until afier 7 o'clock on ilie night ot the tire ; 1 took lodging at 'he Central House, which, bye-the bye, 1 have always regarded as one amongst the best hotels in tue country ; 1 re-tired at lu o'clock, being much fatigued : I was soon in a sound sleep, Irom which 1 dul not awake until after 2 o clock, when I was aroused irom my slumbers by the awful roaring of 11.unes, the wild confusion ol persons running to and fro, amidst all the horror and consternation tiiat might be expected to seize upon a people not used to such scenes, and a recollection of which almost makes me shudder to this day. The room tiiat 1 occupied was iu the North end of the build? ing, immediately Homing, and situated but a few steps from the "big hotel," as it was called, where the tire originated. When first discovered by me, the end of that vast building next to my room was enveloped. 1 do not think that I was more than thirty live feel from the flames, and as they were bursting out of the upper stories of that house and across the narrow street that divided the two huittls, it was really difficult for me to determine whether the fire was confined to one or to both buildings. Not being familiar with the plan of the house, and seeing no chance for. escape, towards the fin, my first care was to see if I could get out by any oilier way. 1 opened the door, and seeing an aisle that led back from the fire, I dressed my? self and made my way out of the house as best I could. I do not believe that I had left my room more than fifteen minutes before it was in flames. I did not speak to any lady in the house on that night, and I have no recollection of any speaking to me. 1 am sure that had my hostess, or any other lady, asked me for aid- that-my gallantry would have been equal to the service. Having re? gained the street, and to some extent my self-pos? session, my first care was to look out for my horse, but in doing this some of my accusers contend "that I showed too much selfishness?that I was looking after my property when the town was burning up." Perhaps it is so, but I may be per? mitted to urge, in extenuation of my conduct, tiiat every other person that I came in'contact with, ?vho had anything at stake, appeared to be cx ! cccdiiigly busy iu minding, their own business, and ! showed, as 1 thought, a most laudable determina? tion to save their own property. In this, fellow citizens, I did not soar above the common frailty. The first man I met in the street was Mr. Barron, who appeared to bo connected with the manage? ment of th? hotol. I B?ked him where I might find the hostler. "I do not know," said he, "but here is the stable key.1" I received it from him, ran round to the stable, throwing the lot gate wide open as I went, unlocked the stable door, and en? tering in, found my horse tied in one stall, and an? other tied in an opposite stall. These two horses were all the stock that I saw in the stable. I found my horse lo be much frightened and hard to manage. 1 succeeded, however, in getting him out of the stable, and led him off some distance in the woods ami tied him up. The hostler (a boy of color) now made his appearance, leading the other horse out of the stable. He hitched him to a tree not so far from the fire as I had left mini, and turned to me aud asked if his horse Was far enough oil' to be out of danger. 1 told him that he was. The boy anil myself then returned to the lot, and as I supposed that he would attend to the hotel slablcs, I turned to another stable, as I took it to be, and which, from its isolated location. 1 suppo? sed to belong to some one ele*.- The door of this building I found to be locked, and supposing ih .t it contained horses, or stock of some kind, I forced the door open; but the light from the fire shining on the forge showed me that it was not a stable, but a blacksmith shop, which, I afterwards learned, belonged to Mr. Smith. Just at this time the hostler passed me, pulling a buggy after him, and asked mc to assist him with it. I took hold to' push it after him, and although we had but little trouble in getting down to the branch, yet- in mounting the bluff on the opposite side, onr com? bined strength was taxed to the utmost before wc got up it. (This boy, if he was legal evidence, I know would confirm what I say. ) Having reached the common level, the boy ran off with the "buggy to a safe distance, and I returned towards the fire Just at this time, Ml\ Barron passed me, which' was the first time that I had seen him since he had1 given mc the stable key. I said to him, "Barroti, we have saved all tho stock," but added, "I did not find my saddle, bridle and blanket." He replied, "I took-them, Vandiver, down to the branch and hung them on a log." We then both of us re? turned to the lire, which was making frightful pro? gress. It occurred to mc, just then, that perhaps the next best service that I could render would be to sec the business men, and to caution them about their valuables. I accordiugly hastened to the store of Bev. B. F. Mauldin, and a.?kcd him if he had rescued his ledgers, notes, cases, &c. He re? plied that he had, and added that he had removed all his valuables out of his safe. I next met Mr. Ligon, another merchant of the place, and pro? pounded to him the same questions, and received similar answers, for although his storeroom was not immediately threatened, yet fearing that an.ex plosion of gun-powder might scatter the fire all over the town, I thought it well enough to be pre? pared for the worst. My attention, just at thi* time, was directed to the almost superhuman exer? tions of Mr. Burns, and several of the studrnts-of Mr. Kennedy's School, in trying to save the Drug Store of Dr. Mill wee. They succeeded, contrary to my expectations, which arrested the progress of the Ih mes in that direction.. Their efforts on thi? occasion would have done honor to an experienced fire company. At this juncture, all the buildings down to the carriage factory of J. J. Ack?r, were in flames. I passed round to the premises of these gentlemen, and on inquiry, found that they had secured their books, notes. &c., and w;? re? joiced to sec thai by the exertions of rhemseUw, and the aid of several other yoang g>irtle?aeB ?rho were assisting them, that they succeeded in r . Nng their buildings also, which terminated tow dr.?a* trous conflagration. Seeing that I could render no further aid, I retired to the residence of in? on? ly brother of my surviving parent for reftrwhra^ot and repose, mentally praying that in 'the provi? dence of (.rod thai it might not ag-iin be .ny s?d fortune to mingle in such scenes. I am sorry, feliow citizens, to be ur.dcr the ne? cessity of calling your attention to all these things, but a report has gone out that "Vtfttixinrhas ruined himself at Willi.-.mston," and as nwrijr of you know nothing about the facts La tS? cose* ? thought it my duty to furnish you a true statement of every particular, that you night be the bettrr able rightly to appreciate the report:!, as well a-t the motives of those who put them in circulation. I know that 1 did not daring:hu excitement ofthat hour observe that coolness, self-possession or quiet' demeanor, that I would observe in Church, or arouud your firesides; neither do I believe why oilier person could; but where can be the justice of ihe rule thai takes our cxckabilities instead of our principles, or our impulses instead of onr par poses. Jor the standard of the man. H. R.
