M'KINLEY’S MESSAGE 4 AUTIOUS COURSE URGED ANENT CUBA. | • NO INTERFERENCE YET A Plan ot Currency Reform Proposed by Which to Break the So-Called Endless Chain—Annexation of Ha waii Boldly Advocated—Other Themes Discussed. Washington, D. C„ Dec 7.—Yester day President. McKinley sent his an nual message to congress. Peace and good will with all the nations of the earth continue unbroken, he says, and wo should (eel genuine satisfaction at the growing spirit of fraternal regard and uoiflcatb n In all sections of our country and the lifting of great public questions above party prejudice. Be ginning with the subject of the finances the president says that while the full effect of the legislation of the extra session has not yet been realized what It has already accomplished as sures us of Its fitness and wisdom. To test Its permanent value further time will bo required and the people, satisfied with Its operation and results thus far, are lit no mind to withhold from It a fair trial. The next question pressing for consideration is that of the currency. With the great re sources of the government and with the honorable example of the past be fore us we ought, ho says, not to hesi tate to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obliga tion loss onerous to the government and relievo our financial laws from am biguity and doubt. The evil of the present system Is found In the great cost to the government of maintaining at parity with gold obr different forms of money, and the experience of the pest four years has demonstrated that t ils Is not only an expensive charge upon the government but a dangerous menace to the national credit. It. Is manifest that wo must devise some plan to protect the government against bond Issues for repeated redemptions. Wo have $900,000,000 of currency which the government by solemn en actment has undertaken to keep at par and nobody Is obliged to redeem in gold but the government, which must borrow the gold. The law which re quires the payment out of the treasury of redeemed United States notes de mands a constant replenishment of the gold reserve, especially in times of panic and of Insufficient revenue, and curing the preceding administration $202,325,400 4V6 per cent, bonds were Issued and sold to sustain the gold re serve and pay the expenses of the government In excess of the revenue. While It Is true that a greater part of this was used to supply deficient rev enues, a considerable portion was re quired to maintain the gold reserve. If no further legislation is to he had to correct this, and the policy of selling bonds Is to he continued, thou con gress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at kng or short periods, hearing a less rate of Interest than 1s now author ized by law. The president says: “I earnestly recommend, as soon as the receipts of the government are quite sufficient to pay all expenses of the government, that when any United States notes are presented for redemp tion In gold, such notes shall bo kept and sot apart and only paid out In ex change for gold. This Is an obvious duty. If tbo bolder of United States notes prefers the gold and gels It from the government ho should not re ceive them back from tho government of tbo United States without paying gold in exchange for them.” That (mounts, In the president’s mind, to giving an Interest-bearing debt, a government bond, for a non-Interest bearing debt, a United States note. The government should be relieved from tho burden of providing all the gold required for exchanges and ex perts. 'nils ought to be stopped. With an era of prosperity and sufficient melpts we may feel no Immediate em barrassment. but the danger will be ever present, bo declares. The presi dent Invites careful consideration for the detailed plan of the secretary of the 'veasury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs with him In the recom mendation that national banks be al lowed to Issue notes to the face value of their bonds deposited: that the cir culating lax be reduced to one-half of one per cent., and that national bank may be established with a capital c $25,000, Ho also recommends that th Issue of national bank notes be restrlc ed to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards and that they be re quired to redeem their notes In gold. Cuba. Turning to foreign atf-iirs th’ president devotes much space to consideration of the Cuban question, which he says is the most Important problem with which our government Is now called upon to deal in Its foreign relations. Summarizing the history of former outbreaks the president comes down to the present Insurrec tion, speaking of Its remarkable In ciease, its tenancious existence against the enormous forces massed by Spain, the widespread destruction of property and the disregard of the civilized code of war on both sides. He says the second condition gives rise to the gravest apprehensions. There is no desire on our part he declares to profit by Spain’s misfortunes and we have only the desire to see the Cuban enjoying that measure of self control which Is tho inalienable right of man. Of the concentration policy of Gen. Weyler he says; "It has ut terly failed as a war measure. It Is not civilized warfare —it is extermina tion." Against this abuse of the rights of war the president says ho has felt constrained on repeated occasions to enter the firm and honest protest of this government. Ho outlines his In structions to Minister Woodford, which were In substance to impress upon the Spanish government the sincere wish of the United States to lend its aid toward tho ending of tho war by reaching a peaceful and busting result, just and honorable to Spain mid to the Cuban people. It was also asked whether Spain of her own voli tion should not make proposals for settlement and It was said that he coifld not contemplate an indefinite period for the accomplishment of this re sult. The Spanish reply to Mr. Wood ford was, In the president’s opinion, in the direction of a hotter under standing. It admitted that tho new government was bound to a change of policy that should satisfy the United Slates and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end politi cal reforms will be put into effect and military operations continued on hu mane lines. It was suggested that Slain be left free to conduct her mili tary operations and grant political reforms while (he United States for its part should enforce neutral ob ligations and cut off the assistance which the insurgents, it was asserted, received from this country. An early v and complete pacification Spain hope:! for. The president declares that the Spanish disposition to charge us with failure to meet International duties Is baseless and points to the efforts this government have made at the cost of millions and by employment of the administrative machinery (of the nation to perform Its full duty. He also says tbut tho fact that no military expedition or armed vessel has left our shores has been diplomatically represented to Spain. Premising that, throughout all the horror and danger to our own peace, tho United States has neve/ abrogated its right to de termine Its policy as to Cuba, the president points out that of the un tried measures there remains only: Recognition of the Insurgents as belligerents; recognition of the in dependence of Cuba; neutral Interven tion to end the war by Imposing a latloual compromise between the con testants; an intervention in favor of one or the other party. He says: "I speak not of forcible annexation, for that cannot bo thought of. That by our code of morality would bo crimi nal aggression.” Taking up the question of belligerency, the president quotes at length from President Grant’s message of December 7, 1875, wherein he declared that the condi llous In Cuba warranted neither the recognition of Independence nor the recognition of belligerency. Ho adds moreover a recognition of belligerency would confer upon neither party to the conflict a status not heretofore actually possessed, while It would weigh heavily in Spain’s behalf, giv ing her tho right of search on the high seas and extending her maritime l ights to the margin of our territorial waters. “For these reforms," says the president, "1 regard fhe recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban Insur gents as now unwise and therefore inadmissible." "Should that step hereafter be deemed wise, us matter of right and duty, the executive will take it,” he continues. Ho points to the ho pom I change In the Spanish policy to the pledge of reform and to the abatement of the horrors of war as reasons against Interveniion on humanitarian grounds. The first acts of the new government, he says, lie In the hon orable paths It has outlined. The pulley of rapine and extermination has been reversed; broad clemenclet lave been proffered; measures have been taken to relieve the honors o' starvation. He Insists that 11 is hon estly due to Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to roalls< her expectations and to prove the as sorted efficacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevoc ably committed. He points to the many concessions already made, to the modification of the horrible order of concentration, to the release of the Competitor prisoners and the fact that not a single American cltlxen is I now under arrest In Cuba. He says ; the near future will demonstrate whether a rlghteoua pence Is likely to ! be attained. If not, the exigency of further and other notion by the I United tSates will remain to be taken. Sure of the right, the government will continue Its watchful care over every American citizen and its efforts to bring about honorable peace and, says the president, “if it shall hereafter ap pear to be a duty imposed by our ob ligations to ourselves, to civilization nd to humanity to intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part and only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to cc mmand the support and approval of the civilized world.” Hawaii. The president next takes up the sub ject of the annexation of Hawaii which, he says, should be accom plished. Rapidly reviewing Ids for mer arguments In favor of annexa tion, he says that legislation is re quired in the event of the ratification of the treaty and, while an abrupt assimilation of the immature elements of population should be avoided, jus: provision should be made for self rule in local matters with the largest political liberty to the Hawailans. He says that the dispute between Japan and Hawaii ever the Immigration question is now In a s itisfactory stage of settlement by negotiations; that our government has not Intervened and that It is learned that Japan is now confident in the intention of this government to deal' with all possible ulterior questions affecting her Inter ests lu the broadest spirit of friendli ness. Miscellaneous Matters. Reference is made to the failure of Mr. Merry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on account of the obliga tions of that country to the di-t of the greater republic of Central America. As there is no legal authority at pres ent to accredit him to the diet Mr. Baker, the present minister at Nicara gua, has been directed to present his letters of recall. W. Godfrey Humor is said to be likewise accredited to Honduras, a member of the greater republic, and his case Is awaiting ac tion. The Nicaragua canal Is spoken of as of large importance to our country and the promise is made of a further refer ence to the subject which, in the re port of the commission now at work, is sent to congress. The president says x)f the interna tional monetary commission that, notwithstanding diligent effort, the envoys have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratification is expressed at the ac tion of France In this matter lu join ing in our efforts and it is su'd that negotiations are still pending. Mean while the envoys have not made their final report, believing that the aoubls raised in certain quarters respecting the feasibility on maintaining the parity between gold and sliver may yet be solved. The president earnestly hopes that their labors may bring about an international agreement. Mr. Kasson of lowa is said to I>e now conducting negotiations with several governments for reciprocity arrange ments under the tariff act and it is be lieved that, by a careful exercise of the powers conferred by the act, some grievances of our own and other coun tries in our mutual trade relations may he removed or alleviated and the volume of our commercial exchanges enlarged. The president earnestly urges the improvement of our merchant marine that an inferiority, which he says is humiliating to the national pride, may bo removed. Reference Is made to the recent con ferences at Washington on the subject of the protection of seal life, the result of which places beyond controversy the duty of the governments concerned to adopt measures without delay for the preservation >f the herds. Negotia tions to this end are now in progress. International arbitration is declared by the president to represent the best sentiment of the civilized world and treaties embodying these humane prin ciples on broad lines without in any way imperiling our interests or honor will have his constant encouragement. A liberal appropriation i? bespoken In order that the United Plates nay make a creditable exhibit at the ap proaching Paris exposition, in which the pimple have shown an unprecedent ed interest. Under the head of navy, the presi dent points to the neeessity for speedy legislation to procure the armor for the three battleships now building which would be otherwise useless. He speaks in terms of praisfe of the quality of our ships and thinks that the time has now arrived when the increase to which the country is com mitted for a time take the form of in - creased facilities commensurate with the Increase of our naval vessels. He refers to the lack of docks and urges that three or four of the largest docks l)e provided on the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific coast and a float ing dock in the gulf. There should also be ample provisions for munitions of war and an increase of officers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessity to the navy yards and. tis there are now on thi stocks five large battleships, it is recom mended that an appropriation be | made but for one more battleship on the Pad he coast. Several torpedo t boats are also necessary. | Attention is called to the reed for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extension of civil authority within the territory. There is need for sur veys and for the establishment of another land office at some point In th * Yukon valley for which an ap pioprlation is asked. A mllita.y force is also necessary and the establish ment of some sort of flexible govern ment. If the startling reports as to the probable shortage of food for the miners be fully verified, every effort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. The message deals with the un satisfactory condition of affairs in the Ii dian territory. Tne large white element is said to be without protec tion and without schools or other rights of citizenship, the leading Inc’lans 'have absorbed great tracts of laud and created an aristocracy and the friends of the Indians believe that the best interests of the five civilized tribes would be found in American citizenship Reference Is made to the ailure so far of the Daws commission to secure the consent of the tribes to the extinguishment of the tribal titles and a division of the lands. It Is said that should the tribes still fall to ratify the agreement then some legis lation should be had by congress. The president approves the recom jmendation of the secretary of the treasury for an extension of the quarantine laws and also suggests the e ppointment of a special commission to ascertain the cause of yellow fever. Speaking of the pending sale of Kansas Pacific railroad, it is said that, if no better bid is received than the Union Pacific set-price fixed by the court, the government would receive only $2,500,000 on its claim of nearly $13,000,000. He believes that the gov ernment has the authority to bid on the road and has directed the secre tary of the treasury to make the de posit of $900,000 required to qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the principal of the debt to the government. He sug gests, however, that In a matter so im portant as the government becoming a possible owner of the railroad, con gress should enact some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him, however, that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one-half the principal of its debt and less than one-flfth of its entire debt, principal and interest. The president devotes the last chap ter of his message to the civil service, the practical improvement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest discussion and which has of late years received increased legisla- I live and executive approval. During | the past few months the service has Imen placed upon a still firmer basis of business methods and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reinstatement has teen asserted, dismissals for merely political reasons have been carefully guarded against; the examinations have been improved and made practi cal, and a distinct advance has been made by giving a hearing before dis missals upon all eases where Incom petency is charged or a demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been done without impairing the power of removal, one of the vital safe guards of the system. Much remains to be done before the system can be perfected and the president says that be shall not hesitate to exempt cases which he thinks have been improperly included in the classified service or in clude those which in his judgment will best promote the public service. The system has the approval of the people and it will be his endeavor to uphold and extend it. In couclusion the president admon ishes congress not to encourage the in crease of estimates for the maintenance of government. They would admit of the decrease in many branches and It is a commanding duty to keep the ap propriations within the receipts of the government and thus avoid a deficit.
