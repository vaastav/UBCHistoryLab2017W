As the days draw near for the conference between the working heads ot the governments associated against Germany, it becomes increasingly evident that President Wilson is going to have a "right smart" argument on his hands if he is going to succeed in effecting the sort of a peace treaty he has always advocated, upon the altruistic principles for which ho has been the spokesman and which have won generally a most favor able response from the peoples of the other nations as well as his own. For, with the lifting of (he censorship there are coming to us not mere hints or suggestions but positive statements that an influential group of reactionary politicians in England and France, with whom the same ele ment in our own country is co-operating, seeks to effect a settlement of this war on the same old selfish basis of "everybody grab all he can" that has marked the end of pervious European conflicts. The American people as a whole have 110 sympathy with such' a game of barter and trade —we look at the situation from a broader atti tude, because of our detached position, and hope for a settlement which shall make another ouch world conflict impossible, and we are confident our hope is not too ideal. We want Germany to pay; we want the former kaiser and his war lords punished, and we want Belgium and France particularly to be recompensed for the awful damage they have sustained; bue we at the same time hope for a settlement broad enough, unselfish enough and fair enough to all peoples that will give impetus to the dem ocratic movement throughout the world and lead to the cstabiirhment of some international means of preventing war. This is what President Wilson is going to France to achieve, chiefly, but it is going to be no easy task. For him, personally, it will be the first time he has really matched wits in close conference with men of equal ability; for the world it will be the first time any nation has fought the historic war slogan, "To the victor belongs the spoils." If he succeeds we shall be ushering in a new era in the world's history. 

GETTING DOWN TO EARTH. * The wooden shipbuilding industry of the United States, essentially a war-time industry and inflated by the needs of the hour, is now face to face with the task of getting down to earth. Tlfp re-adjustment comes far sooner than any one had expected, but it was inevitable. Yet it can be so handled, once its leaders do get squared around, so that it shall continue to be a profitable and import&nt industry, especially here in th£ Northwest. The United States Shipping Board unquestionably was too hasty in its first action of cancelling forty-eight contracts in this district without so much as a preparatory "how-do-you-do." It reckoned not with a lot of things it should have known, chiefly that one that most of the ma terials for these ships had been ordered weeks and months ago; but it readily saw its error, hastened to explain that the contracts were not cancelled but merely "held in abeyance," that the board was endeavoring to sell its vessels in Europe, and that if it succeeded the contracts would be re-instated. Subsequently it has adopted a policy permitting the yards to accept new contracts from foreign as well as American interests so that the work, instead of being suddenly chopped off, may be continued. The "boom" time of the industry is passing, but the needs of the world are Buch that the construction of ships, wooden as well as steel, should continue for some years, providing the industry soon establishes itself on a normal basis. Which means, of course, that the cost of build ing wooden vessels must be greatly reduced. JOIN THE RED CROSS AGAIN. The call for renewal of our membership in the American Red Cross comes to us again next week in another great Christmas drive, and it is our bounden duty as generous American citizens to respond to the appeal as numerously as in the past, so that the great work of this wonderful Or ganization, now turning from the relief of the immediate human toll of war to assuaging the havoc of devastated lands, may be continued. The dol lar that membership costs us grows, through the surprising efficiency of the organization, to a dollar and two cents before its expenditure in its work of welfare, a record no other charitable organization has approached. So from the sordid, material point of view we are getting more than "our money's worth"; while from tlje humanitarian standpoint the value is well nigh immeasurable. Take out a membership for every one In your family. THE QUESTION. OF THE RAILROADS. Upon the coining Republican congress will fall the decision of the policy the government shall pursue regarding the railroads, whether they shall remain under government operation and be brought under govern ment ownership or whether they shall be returned to private manage ment, subject to a greater measure of government regulation than in the past. The president's discussion of the question in his recent message to congress was a remarkably frank one, and, though at first blush he appeared not to propose any particular plan, study of his remarks indicates that he appears to favor their private operation, but under a more strict governmental regulation than before the war, according to a plan he then suggested. , The question is the most important that lies before the country, excepting only the determination of the nation's army and navy policy of the future. Whatever decision may be reached as to the railroads will be applied without doubt to the express companies and the tele phone and telegraph systems. In other words, it is not merely just a question of what we shall do with the railroads; it is the adoption of a governmental policy with reference to the ownerhsip and management of our great national public utilities that is at stake. One of the essential things that the coming legislature should do, and more than likely several proposals for the purpose will be put before it, is the establishment of some sort of a control over the auto stage lines of the state, a business that has seen great development during the past two years especially, to the end that they can be handled in a more re sponsible manner and their service be put on a more reliable, substantial basiE. As things go now there is no more unsatisfactory line of business to deal with and no more discourteous or indifferent or unreliable persons than those that are operating the stage lines. The travelling public in reaped to them puts up with more inconveniences, more irresponsibility and less real service than any railroad, interurban or street car system would dare to offer. 1111.

It will be from six inches to a /ont higher than the usual December tider, the largest of the year. These excessive tids occur at intervals of 19 years and are attributed to an unusual position of the planets, which exert more than the ordinary attraction at that season of the year. A state road convention, composed of delegates from each county, is to meet here next Tuesday and it is ex pected some basis for securing ade quate roads will be agreed on. j
