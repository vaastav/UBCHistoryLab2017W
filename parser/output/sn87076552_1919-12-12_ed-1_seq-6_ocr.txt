FULTON CO. TRIBUNE, WAUSEON, OHIO, FRIDAY, DEC. 12 i; i Si About the Christmas Tree Suggestions for Trimmings and Decorations That Will Make the Holiday More Pleasant. I 0 till n 3kw (JS "ri'A , ' . - i'-v-r c .... U - vijfcl The Christmas , tree seems to the happy eyes of Httle folks the most beautiful and splendid and gracious thing that ' the long year brings to them. Anticipation of it fills the children's thoughts and hearts for weeks before the great day comes, and they are hnppy to have a hand In making preparations for It It seems Important that the Christmas tree should help to Impress on young minds the meaning of the year's great est festival that "peace on earth, good will toward men" Is the occa sion of Christmas Joy and generosity. Therefore the manner of dressing the Christmas tree Is worth considering. All the old-fashioned decorations, which the children have always helped to make, we love for old associations' sake the strings of popcorn and the strings of cranberries, little tarlatan stockings and bogs for holding candy and nuts. Besides these there are birds and butterilies, stars and crosses to be added to the list of things that are made at home. Festoons of tin sel, bright, fragile glnss balls and strings of bright-colored beads, that are bought at the stores will last from year to year, but the home-made deco rations are new every year, and their making is a part of the play. At the top of every tree, on the Up Christmas There are a few fine, old fashioned Christmas observances and pastimes that we have drifted away from, which It la a pity to lose. It is all right to ex change presents at Christmas time, but the mad rush of shopping that en grosses people week or so before the holidays, indicates that Christmas revelries are being replaced by a mere exchange of gifts. After this has been accomplished there is nothing further planned, and the universal wish for a "Merry Christmas" has small chance of fulfillment. We cannot hope to have as ir-any days to give to gayetles as people had a few generations ago when the yule logs' burning measured the length of the holidays. But one, or per haps more days can be planned o that they will not have any dull moments and will not be too crowd ed. Christmas Is above all a day for family reunions and for merry making among relatives and friends. . The Christmas carol has almost been lost sight of more's the pity. . Little parties of children and young people used to serenade their friends and every house had a little spread of cakes and candles, with other Christ mas goodies, which they tendered to the serenaders. Then there were the small merry masquerade parties that were liable to drop In rather early In the evening of Christmas day. One of the party, unmasked, presents him self at the door of a friend or neigh bor, with his masked companions be hind him. Having been made welcome he dons bis mask and enters with his company usually all dressed up In mirth-provoking togs. Then there Is guessing as to who Is who, a little dancing and everyone unmasks. The host and hostess serve a little refresh ment and the masqueraders depart. Fathers and mothers get together be fore Christmas time to prepare and be prepared fbr these parties. Children play their favorite Indoor games that have come down to them and will pass on to other generations. The younger people and others like to dance at Christmas time, so these amusements may always be depended upon. One of the easiest and funniest KEEPING CHRI8TMA8. The birth of Jesus ushered in a new principle of life among men. Until then the law had required an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But In the new era the law of love was the only law recognized. Christ taught ns that wa must bless but never curse, that we must love but never hate, even our enemies. This wonderful change of principle among men we now com memorate by the Christmas festival. And even the most desolate and for DISTRIBUTING THE GIFTS. A novel way of distributing pres ents Is to make a huge stocking of turkey red cotton or white drilling; run a wire In the hem around the top to keep It open, and suspend from a hook In the celling by a wide red rib bon. Decorate a light stepladder with ribbon and holly or Christmas greens, end stand by the stocking. Hang It up a few days before Christmas, and huve nil parcels dropped Into It. Light packages and letters may bo pinned on the outside.

Nothing 19 prettier than the old-fashioned Christmas tree candles, but they are more troublesome than Httle electric llehts and less safe only to be spar ingly used when there are no electric lights to be had. In dressing the tree strings of pop corn and silver tinsel used more abun dantly than the strands of cranberries or red balls, make the prettiest effect They set off all the many colored trinkets placed among them, the red activity and productive of waste and in apples and yellow oranges that find a a pomt wmch ta place on some trees and all the small nlgn rate, of ,ncome and profita taxe8 gifts tied to branches.- The heavier gifts wrapped In white paper and tied with red and green ribbons or tinsel cord are to be placed at the base of the tree and the tree so dressed that when the small gifts are taken ot It Is still a thing of beauty, the Joy and pride of th children during the Christmas holiday Pastimes features that can be introduced at a Christmas party Is the time-honored shadow show.

BUDGET SYSTEM IS URGED Necessity of Increased Production to Help Decrease Cost of Living- Imperative Need of Definite Program Concerning Labor. Washington, Dec. 2. President Wil son's message, which was read to both houses of congress today, only inci dentally mentioned the peace treaty, blaming the delay In ratification as one of the causes of nation-wide un rest. The president said: I hope that congress will bring I to a conclusion at this session legislation look ing to the establishment of a budget sys tem. That there should be one single au thority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should be made not Independently of each other but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of expenditure prop erly related to the nation's Income there can be no doubt I believe the burden of preparing the budget must. In the nature of the case, if the work Is to be properly done and responsibility concentrated in stead of divided, rest upon the executive. The budget so prepared should be sub mitted to and approved or amended by a ingle committee of each house of con gress, and no single appropriation should be made by the congress; except such as may have been Included In the budget prepared by the executive or added by the particular committee of congress charged with the budget legislation. Another and not less Important aspect of the problem is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether ex penditures have been lawfully made with in the appropriations. No one is author ised or equipped to, ascertain whether the money has been spent wisely, eco nomically and effectively. Taxation Question Taken Up.

The message then discussed the fa- rorable balance of trade and the need of adjusting our economic life to the changed conditions and of abandon- tog the policy of isolation. In the matter of recognition and relief for returned soldiers the president re peated the recommendations In his last message. He also urged tariff revision to protect our chemical and dyestutf Industries. He continued: Farmers Are Praised. During the war the farmer per formed a vital and willing service to the nation.

But there is now scarcely less need or increasing the production in LJ - trZnsikVr means of tn food and the necessaries of life. I ask couraglng effort along these lines. The importance of doing everything possible to promote production along economical lines, to improve marketing ana to make rural life more attractive and healthful, is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the congress by the secretary of ag riculture, to secure the essential facts required for the proper study of this question, through the proposed en larged programs for farm management studies and crop estimates. I would urge, also, the continuance of federal participation In the building or good roads, under the terms of ex isting law and under the direction of present agencies; the need of further action on the part of the states and the federal government to preserve and flevelop our forest resources, especially tnrougn the practice of better forestry methods on private holdings and the I extension of the publicly owned for est: support for country schools and the more deflnite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems; and fuller provision for sanitation in rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and medical facilities. Blames Government for Unrest. I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political rest- lessnesa . in our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rather than deep seated. Broadly, they arise 

HOME OF THE CIRCUS. A school teacher was reading an ex citing story to her group of young sters about the jungle. In order that each child might understand clearly what the story was about, she said: 'Which one of you can tell me what the Jungle Is?" One bright little boy waved his hand In the air and the teacher told him to give his definition. He stood up before the class with a great deal of importance and said: The Jungle Is where the circus lives." Ranked High in Literature, "O. Henry," whose real name was William Sydney Porter, was born at Greensboro, N. C, In 1862. After leav- varied journalistic career.

With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rap Idly disappear. In the meantime it does much eviL It seems to me that in dealing with this situation congress should not be impatient or drastic, but should seek, rather, to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis, with 1 meli orated living conditions under the min- mum of restrictions upon personal lib erty that is consistent with our recon struction problems. And it should arm the federal government with power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly polit ical change, however fundamental, there must be no interference, but to ward passion and malevolence tending to Incite crime and Insurrection under guise of political evolution . there should be no leniency. Should Extend Food Control. I renew and strongly urge the neces sity of the extension of the present food-control act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in opera tion. The attorney general has sub mitted a bill providing for an exten sion of this act for a period of six months. As It now stands it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at once. The department of justice has built up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing Its provisions; all of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provi sions of this act are extended. During this period the congress will have an opportunity to make similar, permanent provisions and regulations with regard to- all goods destined for Interstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate shipment, if the requirements of the law are not com plied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipula tion of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively pre' vented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. The president renewed his recom mendations that a law be passed reg ulating cold storage and that all goods destined for Interstate com merce should be maricea witn me price at which they left the hands of the producer.- He also urged the fed- eral licensing of corporations engag ing In Interstate commerce. Coming to the question of labor, the message said : Labor and Capital Peace Renewed. No one who has observed the march of events In the last year can fail to note the absolute need of definite program to bring about an improvement in the condition of labor. There can be no set tled conditions leading to increased pro duction and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be an tagonists Instead of partners. Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the Interests of the whole na tion, as distinguished from the interests of a class, must be applied to tne solu tion of this great and pressing problem. The failure of other nations to consider this matter in a vigorous way has pro duced bitterness and jealousies and an tagonisms, the food of radicalism. The only way to keep men from agitating against grievances Is to remove the griev ances, j An unwillingness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfac tion and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country, which endeavor to stir up disturbance in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. The seed ot revolution Is repression. The remedy for these things must not be negative in character. It must be con structive. It must comprehend the gen eral interest. The real antidote for the unrest which manifests itself is not sup pression but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy. ' Eight-Hour Day Is Big Step. Congress has already shown its will ingness to deal with these industrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor. It has served the whole country by leading the way in de veloping the means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health in danger ous Industries. It must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine demonstration of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work. In what ever rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly af fects their welfare. It is with this purpose in mind that I called a conference to meet In Washing ton on December 1 to consider these prob lems In all their broad aspects, with the idea of bringing about a better under standing between these two interests. Rights of Labor Are Cited. The great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand for an Immediate consideration of the diffi culties between capital and labor, bid us put our own house in order. Frankly, there can be no permanent and lasting settlements between capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been strug gling through the years. The whole world gave Its recognition ard indorse ment to these fundamental purposes In the League of Nations. To analyze the particulars in the de mands of labor is to admit the justice of their complaint In many matters that lie at their basis. The workman demands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live In comfort, unhampered by the fear of poverty and want in his old age. He demands the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary sur roundings, both in home and in workshop. surroundings that develop and do not re tard his own health and well-being; and the right to provide for his children's wants in the matter of health and educa tion. In other words, it is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the

Collective Bargaining Right.' Governments must recognize th right of men collectively to bargain foi humane objects that have at their bas the mutual protection and welfare ol those engaged In all industries. Laboi must not be longer tated as a com modity. It must be regarded as the activity of human beings, possessed of deep yearnings and desires. The busi ness man gives his best tnougnt to me repair and replenishment of his ma chine y, so that its usefulness will not be impaired and its power to produce may always be at its height and kept in full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to be paid to the human machine, which, after all. propels the machinery of the world and is the great dynamic . force that lies back of all industry and progress. Return to the old standards of wage and industry In employment are un thinkable. The terrible tragedy of war which has just ended- and which has brougnt the world to the verge of chaos and disaster would be In vain if there should ensue a return to the con ditions of the past. Labor not only is entitled to an ade quate wage, but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its invest ment and is entitled to protection at the hands of the government In every emergency. No government worthy of the name can play these elements against each other, for there is a mu tuality of interest between them which the government must seek to express and to safeguard at all cost. The right of individuals to strike is inviolate and ought not to be inter fered with by any process of govern ment, but there is a predominant right and that Is the right of the govern ment to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class. The gov ernment, when it asserts that right, seeks not to antagonize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and Injury that might be done by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only government Itself has a right to exercise as a protection to all. 1 Hour of Test and Trial. This Is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and strength and the indomitable courage of her sol diers, she demonstrated her power to vindicate on foreign battlefields het conception of liberty and justice. Let not her Influence as a mediator be tween capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concert be pro claimed to the world. There are those in this country who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority. Russia today, with its blood and terror, is a painful object les son of the power of minorities. It makes little difference what minority it Is; whether capital or labor, or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. Wo are a democracy where the ma jority are the masters or all the hopes and purposes of the men who founded this government have been defeated and forgotten. In America there is but one way by which great reforms can be ac complished and the relief sought by classes obtained, and that is through the orderly, processes of representative gov ernment. Those who would propose any other method of reform are enemies of this country. America will, not be daunted by threats nor lose her composure or calmness in these distressing times. We can afford, in the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to be self-contained and sure. The Instrument of all reform in America is the straight r"ad of justice to all classes and conditions of men. Men have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and revolution. The right road is the road of justice and or derly process. General Pershing as a Grammarian. General Pershing, according to Ever ett T. Tomlinson, parsed himself Into the United States army.

HEWS REVIEW OF CURRENT EVENTS Coat Shortage Becoming Acute and People Demand That the Strike Be Ended. MIDDLE WEST IN DISTRESS Miners' Officials Cited for Contempt of Court Diplomatic Relations With Mexico Likely to Be Severed Soon Supreme Council Calls German Bluff. By EDWARD W. PICKARD. "Give us coal,, and quickly," was the Imperative demand of a great part of the American public last week. So serious had the fuel situation become that it seemed a settlement of the dis pute between the operators and min ers must be forced by dire necessity. In the northwestern and middle West states the condition was aggravated by a severe cold wave, and the people of that part of the country especially. actually became alarmed by the pros pect of freezing to death. Plans for ending the strike at least temporarily were as numerous as the planners. but almost the only steps really tak en were for the conservation of the existing supplies of fuel. It Is true that in some of the western states the operation of the mines was taken over by the state government and volun teer miners were put at work under protection of the state troops. This was, most commendable In principle, but naturally the concrete results ln the way of coal to burn were not ex tensive. Chicago," and Illinois general ly, felt the pinch more acutely than most regions, and prominent men gathered and devised regulations to curtail the use of coal. The state public utilities Issued these regula tions formally, and Governor Lowden proclaimed them, and also planned to ask the federal government to adopt the same rules for the entire country. They cut the working dajy of stores and" -factories to six and half hours, and materially reduced the heating and lighting service everywhere. Al ready the regional coal committee had cut off all new supplies from nones sential Industries. These rules prom ised, within a very short time, to throw out of employment many thou-i sands of men and women. New York city was not suffering from the soft coal strike, because the law permits it to burn only anthracite, but It was worried by rumors that the hard coal miners also might strike soon. In general the Atlantic coast states had enough fuel, and Director General Hlnes was shipping hundreds of carloads from there to the dis tressed middle West, The federal government got Into action again by filing ln the district court at Indianapolis, Information charging criminal contempt of court against 84 international and district officers of the miners' union. These leaders, who include Acting President Lewis and Secretary Green, were sum moned to appear ln court Tuesday and answer the charges. Of course such proceedings may result in the punish ment of the accused men, but will they get coal for the would-be con sumer? That is what the latter Is In terested In just now, and that only. He is thoroughly disgusted with the whole wrangle and Is no more In sym pathy with greedy operators than with greedy miners. In his view, both sides are criminally Inconsiderate of the public needs, and he demands that they be forced Into a compromise. The suffering and financial loss to the peo ple already have been Immense and cannot now be checked entirely even If coal mining is resumed at once. But the people do Insist that they be kept warm from now on. . Toward the end of the week hope arose that the warring operators and miners might reach an agreement. A number of the largest operators form ulated a new wage scale offering slightly more than the 14 per cent

Benin. Germany has a new "Hymn of Hate," entitled 'Vp German Up per Sllesians." It a specimen of German anti-Polish propaganda and, translated, juns as follows: If Silesia becomes Polish, may God let children and cattle die unborn. May God paralyze and cripple the raise suggested by Dr. Garfield and making certain other concessions. This scale was submitted to the fuel ad ministration before being made public. Though in most of the mine fields the men were reported to be firmly stand ing for the 31 per cent Increase which Secretary Wilson proposed, ln some parts of the- country they were said to be drifting back to work on the Garfield basis; and it was hoped that even If their union did not accept the new scale offered, it would help to break down the holdout of the more stubborn. At this writing Consular Agent Jen kins Is still in jail at Puebla, the state department at Washington Is await ing a reply to its second request that he be released immediately, and Pres ident Carranza Is in conference with Generals Marguia and Dieguez, two of his strongest military commanders. Secretary Lansing's second note went to considerable length to refute the contentions put forward by Mexico ln the Jenkins case and closed with a repetition of the urgent request for the freeing of the consular agent, but It was no more of an ultimatum than the first note. The Mexican congress formally put the whole matter In the hands of Carranza. Many members of congress as well as many other Americans are not sat isfied with the administrations Mex Tcan policy, and in response to this feeling Senator Falj of New Mexico drafted a resolution requesting Pres ident j Wilson to sever diplomatic re lations with Mexico, and to withdraw, his recognition of the Carranza gov ernment. . The resolution was taken under consideration by the foreign re lations committee, and' that body had before it copies of official documents said to disclose the activities of Car ranza, his embassy in Washington and his consulates in various American cities, to stir the radical elements to revolutionary outbreaks.- There was a report that these documents were supplied by Secretary .Lansing, who wished congress to relieve him of the responsibility for ' aggressive action against Mexico. It was said that Pres ident Wilson had not been consulted concerning the Mexican crisis and that the state department wanted congres sional action before breaking off dip lomatic relations. If this were the state of affairs, It seemed likely that Mexico could not avert the rupture now by releasing Mr. Jenkins. The demand that the whole unsavory mess be cleaned up Is growing Insistent, notwithstanding the fact that the mo tives of some of the loudest, shouters for such action are open to grave sus picion. - When he Introduced his resolution Senator Fall said the evidence by which it is supported "will astound tile people of the United State when It Is produced." Senator Ashurst scored the war department for Ignoring re peated requests for sufficient troops to protect the border.
