Although this statement already has been ex pressed by Senator P.everidge and Secretary Root. Its reiteration by President Roosevelt gives it the final stamp of authority.

COSSTITVTIO. Comment of English Paper on Sig nificance of Message. London, Deo. s.— President Roosevelt's mes sage to the American Congress occupies the most prominent place in tho leading newspapers this morning, and has attracted widespread at tention from government officials, diplomatists iu;d the public. The prevailing tone of the com ment is favorable, particularly with reference to the President's statements on the Japanese question, tlit- newspapers emphasizing the Presi dent's warning of a possible use of the federal forces for the protection of Japanese. This feat ure of the message has given especial satisfac tion in official Japanese quarters, where it Is point' d out that Japan Is satisfied to await the outcome of the Issue between the state and fed eral authorities. Th.- Dally Telegraph" says the President ■paalrs out reso'utely and fearlessly, knowing that the democracy likes a man who Is not afraid to be its master.

CANADA CLINGS TO SEAL RIGHTS. New British Ambassador May Help Clear Up Bering Situation. ■London. Deo. 4. — President Roosevelt's refer ence in his message to Congress to the negotia tions between the United States and Great Brit ain on Bering Bea affairs relates to tlie long pending efforts made to protect adequately the seal herd?. The negotiations have been con ducted chiefly at Washington with the co-opera tion of the American Embassy here, and appear to be part of a general plan to close some out standing questions in which Canadian interests are involved. The ret - % nt trend of the negotiations has been toward having Canada relinquish such rights as she poaaessea in the Boring Sea, In considera tion for adequate compensation or concessions in other pending questions. However, these ex changes have not made any notable advance, as Canada regards her rights in the Bering Sea in the light of a national asset, and while dis posed to make a reasonable adjustment, she does not appear to bs ready to give up her Interests on the basis of the concessions thus far tenta tively proposed. Tho negotiations therefore lack recent definite development, although the gov ernment officials here hop>j that the appointment of a new ambassador to the United States may lead to the clearing up of this and other pending questions.

Mr. White will be succeeded at Rome by Lloyd C. Griscom, now American Ambassador to HraziL It is stated that beyond these changes the President has not definitely settled upon the persons who are to be appointed to fl.ll the vacancies caused by the promotions and ex changes. Charles Pag© Bryan, of Illinois, the Minister to Portugal, has been mentioned in connection with the post of Ambassador to Brazil, which will be made vacant by th« trans fer of Mr. Griscom to Rome. Mr. Bryan was formerly Minister to Brazil, and his assignment to Portugal was in the nature of a promotion. As the Brazilian post has since been raised to an embassy, his return to Rio would Ilkewl3e be a decided promotion. The vacancy at St. Petersburg, which will result from the transfer of Ambassador Meyer to tho Cabinet, will probably be filled by the promotion of a person now !n the diplomatio service with the rank of minister, though the change will not be made until next spring, In order to await the retirement from the Cabinet of Secretary Shaw and the transfer to tho Treasury of Postmaster General Cortelyou, which will afford the necessary place for Mr. Meyer. 

WOULD SUSTAIN 'FRISCO. Southern Senators Fear Interference tcith States' Rights. fFrom Tttu Tribune Bureau.] ■Washington, Dec. 4.— There Is a general dis position among the Southern Democratic mem bers of the Senate to fly to the rescue of Cali fornia and to oppose vigorously any effort the administration may make to coerce the people of that state into admitting Japanese pupils into the same schools with white children. Senator Rayner, who introduced In the Sen ate to-day resolutions on this subject, believes that he will have the entire minority behind him. He 13 preparing a speech on the subject which he believes will create considerable ex citement, provided he is not compelled to deliver It in executive se3slon. The Democrats see in what they believe to be the Intended course of the President a radical Interference with states' rights, and they probably fear the establishment of a precedent which might be used to compel them to grant social equality to the Negroes. Senator Rayner's resolutions are aa follows; Resolved. That In the opinion of the Senate this government has no rluht to enter Into any controversy with any foreign government relat ing to tho public school system of any of the states in the Union; Resolved, further, That it is the opinion of the Senate that there is no provision In the treaty between the United States and the gov ernment of Japan that relates in any manner to this subject or In any way Interferes with the right of the State of California to conduct and administer its system of public schools In ac cordance with its own legislation; and Resolved, further, That it Is the duty of the President of the United States to notify the government of Japan and to notify any foreign government with which th<> question may arise that the public educational institutions of the states are not within the Jurisdiction of the United States and that the United States has no power to regulate or supervise their admin istration.

At tho -Navy Department It was Bam that the Japanese naval attache, accom panied by a Japanese naval engineer ht»l re cently visited the Brooklyn navy yard, with the permission of the Navy Department, such visits being customary and a part of tho courtesies extended by all governments to Jho naval at taches of friendly nations.

Dec. 4. — There is a disposition among tho House leaders to throw down tho gauntlet to Mr. Gompers, president of the Ameri can Federation of Labor, and the programme which Is being: seriously discussed Is to report unfavorably from the Committee on Judiciary every labor measure but tho Gilbert Aiiti-Injuno t!on bill and to report that favorably. Tha Gil bert bill, which Is well known, will, with a few amendments, accord with the President's views and will doubtless be carried through as aji ad ministration measure. The Speaker and other leadera of the Hous« are- delighted with the manner In which the President handled labor and the subject of in junctions In hie message, and thf-y bf-lleve that to follow up his recommendations In a fearless, manly way, to report, discuss and reject all of the radical labor bilis. and then to pass the »;:: bert bill, with such amendments as are necessary to bring It into entire accord with the Presi dent's views, will prove by far the wisest method of dealing with this troublesome question. The members of the Judiciary Committee are known to be in perfect harmony with the House leaders, and there Is ample reason to believe that the Senate will accept tho measure approved by the President and passed by the House, while It is felt that to vote for this measure arvl against all others will work no possible injury to members of the House.
