TerfchA Minister Visits Olaey end a a Eaoltlna- Iatorv.ow r«U«w»—Sftontloa Diplomatic BelaKoos Be* NEW YORK, Dec. 13. A Washington •pedal to The World says President Cleveland hat been calledtoaccount by the saltan of Turkey. An emphatic protest has been made by the Turkish government against the language used in the president's message to congress respecting the massacre of the Arme nians and the general conduct of the government towards the Christians in the empire. The situation is said to threaten the rupture of the diplomatic relations between the United States and Turkey. Mustapha Bey, the Turkish minister, it is rumored, has intimated at the state department that if some amends is not made by the president he will be obliged to ask for his papers and will return to Constantinople. Thedeep dis- ., -_ .. pleasure of the sultan was made known ^^[f^J^J^^ to Secretary Olney on Thursday by Mustapha Bey in accordance with a cablegram received by him on Wednes day from his home government. Somewhat Exciting Interview. The interview between the minister and secretary of state is described as exceedingly interesting and somewhat exciting. Mustapha Bey began by stating that his government had in structed hun to make an immediate and emphatic protest "against the harsh and unjust language used by the president in his public utterances con cerning a power with which the United States sustained friendly diplomatic' relations." I This was accusing President Cleve-: land of a diplomatic discourtesy, but the minister made it still more serious! by stating that the sultan regarded President Cleveland's message as the argument of an advocate, in that he presented only one side of the case, al though he possessed complete informa mation regarding the other, or Turkish side, which had been officially commu nicated to him. The minister also called attention To Vnrlona Grievances that his government entertains against citizens of the United States. He said that they had libeled the sultan and abused the Turkish government and had been allowed to do so unrepri manded by the president, although some of them were public officers. Complaint was also made against American missionaries in Turkey, who were charged with inciting the Arme nians against the Turkish government and with aiding them by nmprt'ng ir* or concealing the manufacture of dyna mite bombs in Christian churches. It is said that Mustapha Bey pre sented what the Turkish government regards as proof of these charges and that they are now on file in the depart ment. Among those accused are Br. Cyras Hamlin, the well known Congre gational minister, and. Doctors Dwight and Washburn of Boberts college in Constantinople. 

CAUSES MUCH CONCERN. Agitation In Yonoonoln Aamlns* the Arbi tration Agreement May Defeat It WABHnarOH, Dec 11.—The unofficial reports from Venezuela that a serious agitation has sprang np against the boundary settlement agreed on between the United States and Great Britain causes much surprise and no little con cern in official quarters here. Minister Andrade and Mr. James Storro were to have sailed from La Guayara, the sea port of Caracas Friday noon on the RedD steamer Philadelphia, and the boat was expected to reach New York the 16th. Mr. Andrade had cabled the time of his leaving, and had added an official cablegram to Mr. Olney, stating that President Crespo approved the agreement and would call an extra ses sionof congress to ratify it. For this reason the reports that Mr. Andrade and Mr. Storro Jirill not re turn at present, owing to unexpected developments growiagout of the agita tion against the settlfment, is felt to embarrass, and possibly imperil, the final adjustment which had been con* fidently expected at ail early day Biasings F*rtl*,000.

Silver Beneters Wh Baited at St. Loala Have No Plan of Action as Tet. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5—There are quite a number of senators who walked out of the Republican national conven tion in the city. Senators Cannon, Dubois and Pettigrew met at the Cap itol during the day, hut discussed mat ters only in a general way. There has been some speculation as to whether these former Republican senators would attend furore Republican cau cuses. One of them, when questioned, said that it would be time enough for him to decide when he was invited to a caucus, and called attention to the fact that notices always are served on Re publican senators that a caucus is to be held. The general opinion of the silver men is that No Imnertant Legislation can be passed at this session. There is also an impression that the Republi cans and the silver men would prefer that nothing be brought to an issue un til after the various senatorial elections in the Western states, when the com plexion of the silver and independent forces in the next senate will be more plain. Senator Pettigrew, in an interview, said he did not consider the prospect* for tariff legislation at the approaching session very good, but added that he was a protectionist and opposed to ob struction. "I should like to see the Re publicans given all the protection they want, in order that the country might discover that it is not the want of prow taction which is in fault in the present condition of affairs.*'

MACE0 DEAD AGABi CUBAN GENERAL REPORTED KILLED IN HAVANA PROVINCE. lie Had Creased the Famous Trocba and Was Sfarehlnf? on the Capital—Defeated »ne Banmiaros Only to Meet Death Two Dors I*ter-_BecognltlOB of the Body of the Cuban Loader Said Complete. A A S A 10.—It is stated in most positive terms by the Spanish au thorities that Antonio Maceo, the great insurgent leader and the heart and soul of the Cuban cause, has been killed in Havana province after having effected the nassase ef the western trocha near MarieU at its northern extremity. With the Cuban leader died the youth, Francisco Gomes, son of Maximo Gomez, who accompanied the mulatto general on his passage of the trocha. Most explicit details of thefindingof the corpses of the fallen Cubans and of the facts relied upon for their identifi cation are at hand through the report of the Spanish commander, Major Ciru jeda, who contested the passage of the trocha unsuccessfully on Dec 4 with Maceo, and who sustained another con Aict on Monday with the forces under the insurgent leader It was in a re connaissance after the latter engage ment that the Spaniards found the two corpses, not separated in death, which they have positively identified as those ef Antonio Maceo and Francisco Gomes. The Ideatlfleatwa. One of the bodies was a mulatto, a stout man, with gray, crispy, curling hair, and the other that of a slender, dark haired youth. Both men were dressed in white hnen deck suits. When the suit was removed from the corpse of the elder of the two, it was found to have under it a fine xuidershirt with the initials "A M." upon it. The pair of black silk socks •on this body containing the same init ials worked in red. There was a gold ring on the finger contained on the in ner rim the engraved inscription "An tonio Maria." A revolverwithan ivory nandle and marked, together with a •mall gold mounted telescope, were, also found on the body. The head, of the younger man's body was resting upon the body of the first. There was found on it a silver watch, an ammuni tion bag and several handkerchiefs bearing the initials "F. G." Caw a a, Ssaietleo inSuvana, The news that Antonio Maceo had xaet his end caused the greatest sensa tion in Havana and was deemed very —eonrsging to the Spanish casse. Saace the famous raid of the Cubans across the whole of the island last year, when Maceo invaded Finer del Rio while Gomex returned to the eastern jneeintie, the mulatto general has held Msown in thewestern province against theutmost efforts of die Spaniards to dislodge ham.

The inspired government newspaper, La Union Constitotional, affirmed nothing of its own knowledge and qualified every st-tement, and edi torially referred to Macro's death as current rumor, Beoremely Important If Trme. High officials in Havana are lothtoad mit that Weyler failed with 60,000 men to accomplish what less than 500 did. Only Tuesday heavy reinforcements left Artemisa by rail to co-operate with Helquizo in the attack on the rebel po sitions near San Juan Martinez, where Maceo is new believed to be en camped Various residents of Punta Brava talked with The World corre spondent, and they scouted Cirujeda's reports. They say the Spanish troops under Cirujeda were subjected to a hu miliating defeat and he lost one-third of his force Rebels pursued him to the outskirts of the town. Neighboring Pacificos seen said the insurgents were commanded by Serafin Sanchez, whom Spanish Report* Killed loot Month in Santa Clara province, adding that if Maceo was with the party the fact was kept quiet The most important Cubans in Havana, sympathizing, aiding or abetting the revolution, disbelieve the story of Maceo's death. They admit his entry into Havana province and be lieTethat he forced the trocha in re sponse to an order from Gomez to as sume command of the operations in the center and reorganize the insurgent forces in Havana, Matanzas and Santa Clara provinces. Another fact proving that the truth is not in the Spanish dis patches about Maceo is that a World correspondent Waa Kefoaed All Information. as to his body A subordinate Span iard explained it this way: "Maceo, seriously wounded, was being con ducted east, probffdy to the principal Cuban hospital in Clenaga de Zapata, for eafety. The escort was attacked by a Spanish force under Major Cirujeda and the wounded chief was captured and killed." Cirujeda attempted to return to Puuta Brava with the corpse, when rebel reinforcements attacked him on the road, rescuing the body. This explanation sounds more prob able than the story given out at the palace. 

CHEERS FOR WEYLER. The Spaa'eh Captain General Return* to Havana, HAVAKA, Dec 12.—Captain General Weyler arrived in this city during the evening on horseback accompanied by members of his staff and a cavalry es cort. The streets of Havana were thronged with people and the houses of the town pad been gaily decorated The Mar ques Ahumada, vice governor general, accompanied by the colonel of his staff, met Captain General Weyler at the en trance of the palace. General Weyler soon appeared on the palace balcony, bowing his acknowledgments to the vivaswhich the multitude in the square were shouting for Spain, Spanish Cuba, the king, the queen, the army, the navy and the volunteers. Captain General Wevler _, brief address in the course of wr.h he said: "I have only directed. The army has done all" Various civil and military delega tions were received later by General Weyler at the palace WAITING FOR MORE DETAILS. Key Wert Catena Loth to Admit Hacco*s Donth. KEY WEST. Fla., Dec. 12.—Maceo's death is still discredited by the greaser number of prominent Cubans here, yet there are many who fear it is true. All await the arrival of the next steamship from Havana before conceding it to be true. The report that Dr. Zertncha, who was Maceo's physician, had seen Maceo's body exhumed, is untrue. It is learned from a reliable source that the doctor never was Maceo's physi cian. Some gentlemen here believe that Maceo had formed a plan with Gomez to go to the Havana district to meet Gomes' forces there, as Gomez had sent 7,000 men to the Havana dis trict Maceo crossed the trocha with 600 men. It is reported that Maceo left Bios Rivera, his second in command, who landed from the United States Sept 1, in charge of the insurgent forces in Pinar del Rio. Bios Bivera defeated the Spanish in the last war in the province of Jovellar. HUNDREDS DROWNED. Wreck of the Stoaaor Sailor OS? the Cooot of Booln, LOXDO*. Dec. 11.—A special dispatch from Berlin, says that the North Ger man Lloyd steamer Salier, was wrecked on the night of Dec 7, four miles north of Yillagarcia, Spain, and 2J£ miles from land. The dispatch further says that she must have broken np almost unmediatety, as parts of the steamer have already washed ashore. She had on boardover 800 passengers, mostly steerage, and a crew of 65 men. All on board were drowned. Of the steerage passengers, there were over 100 Russians, about 26 Gali dans, some Germans and about 200 Spaniards, according to the estimates, all on their way to the Argentine Re public, looking for new homesfor them selves and families. the disaster had occurred after the Saher touched at Yillagarcia, the loss of life would have been much greater, as it -understood there were nearly 100 more passengers men, women and children, awaiting at that port to embark on board the Saner for Buenos Ayres. The Corrobodo rocks, on which it is believed the Salier was hat, are situ atedoffthe southwest coast of Cor unna,and should have beengivena wine berth before the steamer headed cislnsiil and then in a northeasterly direction for the bay leading up to Vfllagerisa. 8*.FnalCaIoa SOOTH ST, PAVI.
