LATEST TELEGRAPHIC NEWS. FOKEIGX SETTS. The Reform Demonstration With drnivnl of the French Troops from Mexico. London, Dec 3. It is estimated that at. least fifty thousand persons were in the pro cession which formed so Imposing a feature ot the iteiorm demonstration wnicu took place to-day. Nearly all the trade socie ties were out in full force, and inarched to the place of meeting. Fifty-seven of these organized bodies, together with various members of the Reform League, were in the line, which was composed of four grand divisions, under the guidance of marshals and led by bands of music, banners, society Insitmia, etc. It was by far the largest and most important affair of the kind which lias ever taken place in tins country, not witlistanding the very unpleasant state o the weather. It is a fact worthy of notice that the stars arid stripes waved above the procession in many places, and was fre rpiently and loudly cheered. The bands, too, accrued to nave caueut the inspiration of theiocoasion, and indulged in the pro-" uucnon oi national airs ui a patriotic cuar- acter. The meeting took place in the grounds of Ueauiort House, a most convenient loca tion for a large gathering. Seven stands were erected for theaccommodation of the several speakers, a' large number of whom were present on the occasion. The storc3 on Pall Mall, Piccodilly, and the other thoroughfares through which the procession passed were closed, and the trades people thronged ttie streets all the way from St, James tr&tK, wnere the procession was formed, to the trrounds at Beaufort House. The greatest order was maintained througli- out the demonstration, and the most lively enthusiasm prevailed. The moral effect of the whole affair cannot be ov.er tsi mated.

The Associated Press quarrel excites little interest here. The policy of tho Association has not changed. The World announced this morning that it would take Craig's newsj and it was then immediately dismissec from the Association. The Herald, Times, and Tribune, it is understood, had a con ference to-day and agreed to interchange special dispatches and send them over the country. They also agreed to advance one hundred thousand dollars each during the next three ruontli3 towards" strengthing and developing the facilitiesof the Association, At this conference it was felt that the con test is not with the country press, but to prevent the creation of a one man tyranny over news like that exercised by Mr. Beu-1 ter, of Europe. The most liberal arrang- ment8 are being made with all papers that' remain true to the Associated Tress. Delegations from the est are here pro testing against the action of Messrs. Hal-, stead & White. The action of the Herald. Tribune, ahd Times, of course, ends the contest, and it is now said that Mr. Uraisr will continue to send only commercial dis- patchs and ship news, abandoning the vol- i ..it; cciiua ui genurai intelligence.

Mr. Sumner hoped the resolution would be referred to the Committee on Foreien Affairs. Se had doubts a3 to the propriety of the resolution, and that at any rate.it should be referred. Mr. Chandler stated that it was tncrcjy a resolution of inquiry, and as such there ought to be no objection to it. Mr. Spalding hoped the resolution wouid not be adopted. It contained language our Government onght. not to use toward an other. It asked if the French Emperor had given any apology. A motion to take up the resolution did not prevail. ' Mr. Chandler called up the bill passed by the House yesterday to repeal the 13th lection of the confiscation act, which gives the i'resident.power to grant a general am nesty to those lately engaged in rebellion Mr. Sherman called for the reading of the section proposed to be repealed, and it was read. Mr. Johnson did not know whether, if the section reterred. to were repealed, the x'resiuent wouia not sun nave power to pardon every man who stood ui a situation to be pardoned. Over that power Congress had nb control. At any rate he thought the subject ought to be referred to some committee. Mr. Fesscnden would express no opinion on the merits of the bill, but was opposed to the passage of any measure until it had been considered in committee. Mr. Howard said there were grave doubts as to whether, by the constitution, tiie par doning power rested in tho President. Mr. Chandler said hundreds of millions of confiscated property had been returned by the President and it was alleeed that pardons were for sale around this town by women of at least doubtful reputation, and millions of property had been restored through this channel. If the President had power to do this thing under the con stitution in God's name let him exercise it, but in uod s name let no power be given him that is not in the constitution. Mr. Trumbull said he should probably vote for the bill, but he teaw no pressinj need Jor it; ana that there was great force in vhat had been said by o'thers, in favor of a reference to a committee.
