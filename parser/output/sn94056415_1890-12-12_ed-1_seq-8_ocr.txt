THIBD PARTY. OF THE FAKXEIVS FA- XIOXAL ALT.IJ.XCE. National Secretary Turner Submit * HI Annual Xlcport Number of Charter * Isaucd the I'aat Year An- 1 nual Ileport of tuo Chairman of the National Executive Committee An Addres * Upon the Future Policy of the Alliance. A Call iMMiicd for a Third Party Con ference. OCALA'Fla. . . Dec. G. The National farmers' alliance passed resolutions re citing that the United States census re turns with respect to farm mortgages wore grossly incorrect , and calling upon all county and sub-alliances in all states to take immediate steps to wards securing accurate statistics from county records and make prompt re ports thereon. National Secretary Turner submitted his annual report. During the past year 1.0G9 new charters were issued to sub-alliances as follows : West Vir ginia , 252 ; Colorado , 152 ; Indiana , 132 ; Michigan , 106 ; Virginia , 95 ; Illinois , 87 ; South Carolina , 83 ; Ohio , (51 ; Pennsylvania , 59 ; New Jersey , 20 ; Minnesota , 5 ; Iowa , 5 ; Oregon , 1 ; Oklahoma , 1. State charters were issued to the following states : In dian , .Illinois , Colorado Michigan , West Virginia , Oklahoma and South Dakota. Some question having been raised as to the unanimous endorse ment of the St. Louis platform "of the national alliance last year , Livingston of Georgia moved its adoption by the present body. Some debate followed , but it was adopted with an amendment so as to demand government control of railroads and telegraph lines , and if this shall not result in relief to the masses and in checking or curing ex isting evils the government shall be come the actual owner of such lines. This platform does not include the sub- treasury bill. The following is the call for the third party conference , signed by General Rice and John Davis of Kansas and ibout seventy-five other alliance men : Whereas. * In unity there is strength ; therefore , it is desirable that this should be a union of all the variously named 'industrial organizations that stand on common ground. To this end ihe individuals from various states whose names are hereto signed make ibis call for a national conference to be jomposed of delegates from the organ- .ztitions named : Farmers' alliance , rs1 Mutual Benefit association , ' jrl1in.Tir p Tfniorht.a r f Tallinn ; > nrl . _ all other industrial organizations that support the principles of the St. Louis agreement of 1S89. Each state organ ization is to send one delegate from each congressional district and two from each state at large , and each dis trict organization is to send not less " than three delegates and each county delegation not less than one , to be chosen according to the customs of each respective organization during the month of January , 1891 ; also the editor of each newspaper is hereby invited as a delegate - gate that had advocated the princi ples of the St. Louis agreement and supported the alliance candidates nom inated in 1890 , the delegates to meet in Cincinnati. Monday , February 23 , 1890 , for the purpose of forming a na tional union party based upon the fun damental idea of finance , transporta tion , labor and land in furtherance of the xvork already begun by those or ganizations , and preparatory for the united struggle for the country and home in the great political conflict now pending that must decide who in this country is sovereign the citizen or the dollar. An additionalamendment was adopted that every alliance lecturer , state and national , and all newspaper organs of the alliance shall support the platform or suffer suspension from the order ; that no candidate for any national po litical office shall be supported by the alliance unless he endorse the plat form , and any sub-alliance not com plying with these restrictions may be suspended at the pleasure of the presi dent. The whole platform a ? thus amended was adopted unanimously upon a call of the roll by states. Dr. Macune. chairman of the na tional executive committee , submitted his annual report. It referred at length to the subtreasury bill drawn and presented to congress. The com mittee's mission in this respect virtual ly ended because the alliance had elected several congressmen who would look after pushing the bill through the national legislature. In a short time , he said , congress will pass this bill , if not willingly , then by a compromise. The report recommended a reduction in salary of a'li national alliance offi cers and the removal from Washington of the president's office , inasmuch as the retention of it there entails an ex pense not commensurate with its use fulness. At the conclusion of the report Mr. Macune addressed the convention upon the policy of the alliance , especially with reference to its position upon leading public measures and its atti tude towards democrats and republi cans in future political contests. After adjournment he gave , the Associated press the following synopsis of his ut terances upon the third party ques tion : "I told the delegates that the people of the southern states were not prepared to embark in a third party movement ; that in this emergency there was great necessity for conserv atism and caution. I reccommend as a compromise that would carry out the end soughc to be achieved by the wedt and north , if it met the approbation of the southjthat a convention be called for Februaryf1892 , to be cbmposed of dele- Ef ites from all associations of producers , > f > \ and that the next annual session of the supreme council elect delegates to rep resent this order in that convention. This would not commit the people , bul provided means whereby they could express themselves on the questions through their county and state organ , ization during the coming year. When the convention meets the delegates would come there with authority and instructions from their people. If the people decide in favor of independent party action it will prevail. If not the cause will bo benefited by the conference - ence and there will be a better under , 'standing of the objects that labor organizations - ganizations are trying to achieve. ' ' Macuno thinks this will satisfy both sides.

The election bill is then taken up and Senator Pugh [ dressed the senate in opposi- m to it. In the house r. Atkinson called up the bill to fa- litate the settlement of military and , val claims against the United States r pay bounty and allowances. Pend- j action the morning hour expired d the house went into committee of a whole onk the pension appropria- i "i tion bill. Mr. Morrow explained tl the bill appropriated for the payment of pensions the sum of $133,173,000. It was estimated that this sum of money would be distributed among" 654,715 pensioners. This was the larg est number of beneficiaries over pro vided for in any single item in the statutes of the United States. The average gross cost of pensions for 1892 was estimated at $203.40. Ho believed that there would bo no deficiency - . cioncy next year , but , on the contrary , , that there would prove to bo a slight , excess of appropriations. Ho said thls- because ho anticipated that gentlemen , on the other side would call attention , to the fact that there had been pension , deficiencies during the last few years , and would claim that it was the pur pose of the republicans to allow a de ficiency to grow up in 1892. Ho be lieved the appropriation to bo amply suflieient. The discussion continued until the hour of adjournment. In the senate on the 5th Mr. Stan ford introduced a bill to provide the government with means suflieient to supply the national want of a sound circulating medium , and asked that it lie on the table.

Mr. Gray said the bill was fraught with the greatest danger to the future prosperity of the whole country ; that it menaced the liberties of the people of all the states. Speaking of the southern states , Mr. Gray referred to- the improvement of affairs there since the reconstruction period , and asked why should they be interfered with. He particularly attacked the domicil iary clause providing that supervisors , may make a house-to-house visitation , to inquire the politics , names , nation ality , etc. In the house Mr. Cutcheoix of Michigan called up the senate joint resolution authorizing the secretary of war to issue 1,000 stand of arms to each of the states of North and South Dakota , Wyoming and Nebraska. On motion of .Mr. Carter of Montana , Montana was included in the provis ions of the joint resolution , u hich was then passed. The house went into- committee of the whole on the pension appropriation bill. There \\ub a lengthy debate , participated in by Messrs. Cutcheon , Outhwaite , Hender son , iJreckenridge and others. On. motion of Mr. Dockery an amendment was adopted providing that no agent , or attorney shall demand , receive or be allowed any compensation on a claim for an increase of pension on account of increase of disability. It is estimated that this will save i5,000- 000 to pensioners within the next three years. Mr. Springer offered an amend ment increasing to $1 " > 0.000.000 the appropriation. There was no excuse , he said , for a republican house to- make an inadequate appropriation and throw the deficiency on a democratic house. The committee then roae and. appropria"i Farmers' Demands.
