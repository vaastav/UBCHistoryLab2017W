ITS FINAL SESSION. BEGINNING OF THE END FOH PRESENT CONGRESS. Gay Fccnrs at the Capitol on ths Open- ins : Day-Outline of the Work It la Intended to Accouiplibh IJeforo I/Vlh i osigrcss Adjourns- torrej-poiidcnce : roa yomblfd Monday under of unusual public interest. The Kjinio congress six months ago de clared war again Spain , and now , with Uie war fonyltt aiul won. it came together again , for ttif iirt Iog5sn ! < ivo consideration of the questions developed by the event ful months jus-t i-ust. The spirit of the occasion was not , however , one of imrne- difl r vxiieetam-y. for the few months left to the t-xistfiico of the LVth Congress gave promise of little more than a be ginning on th i momentous policies and problems growing out of the war. As usual , .ill Washington turned its at- tntion to the capitol for that gala event which innrks the opeuim' day of a session. JScw Members Sworn In. The opening w.is without ceremony be yond that whir-h marks the usual begin- uiug of a session. Outside of the Presi dent's message there was no reference to the glorious history of the past sum mer. Practically the entire work in both the Senate and the House consisted in giving the oath to now members and reading the President's message. In the Senate Joseph Simon , of Oregon , tool : the oath , completing the membership of that body for the first time in several years. The members were not all present. But there are now somewhere ninety Senators of the United States , the full number authorized Hy the constitution. In the House the oath was taken by Charles A. Dick , of Akron , Ohio , who represents the famous Nineteenth Dis trict , the district once represented by the lamented Garfield. Mr. Dick succeeds the late Stephen A. Xorthway. Two new Representatives from Mississippi also took the oath. F. A. McLane , of Gloster , for the Sixth District in place of the late Mr. Love , and Thomas Spight , of Ripley , for the Second District , in place of W. V. Sullivan , appointed Senator. Distinguished Visitors in the Senate. There were some notable spectators on the floor of the Senate. The Lord High Chancellor of England , the Premier of Canada , and other members of the joint high coinmiss-ion were given seats with the Senators as a mark of consideration. In the diplomatic gallery were Sir Julian Pauncefote , the British ambassador , and his daughter , the minister from Siam and his secretary , the minister from Corca and his wife and secretary , Wu Ting Fang , minister from China , and one of the attaches f the Chinese legation , be sides several diplomats of lesser promi nence. Nearly all of them went out when the -reading of the President's message began , preferring to read the message at their convenience. The reading of the message occupied two hours and eighteen minutes. Then the Senators drifted to the cloakrooms and the committee-rooms to peruse it at their pleasure. Attendance in the House. There were more than the usual number of distinguished personages in the throng ed galleries of the House , including many representatives of foreign governments , high officials , and ladies and gentlemen conspicuous in social and political life. The greetings of the members were most cordial , and there was no outcropping of partisan rancor to mar the occasion. One of the most striking incidents was the cordial meeting between the floor leaders of the respective sides. Messrs. Diugley and Bailey. Speaker Reed received a warm welcome from both sides of the House when he ascended the rostrum to call the House to order , but perhaps the greatest person al o.ation to any member was that given to Major General Wheeler of Alabama , who has not been seen by many of his old colleagues since he went to the front at the head of the cavalry division of Gt-neial Sliafter's army. . W. A. Stone , of Pennsylvania : Benton "McMillin , of Ten nessee , and Joseph D. Sayers , of Texas , who have boon elected Governors of their respective States since Congress adjourn ed , were also overwhelmed with congratu lations. The fior.nl tributes were unusual ly numerous. Representative Cousins of Iowa has the honor of introducing the first bill in the House at this session of Congress. legislation , to Be Enacted. Though many questions may press for solution , the brief space covered by this session , which expires by limitation March 4. precludes the probability of much being accomplished beyond the passage of the regular money budgets , the legislation for the increase of the regular army , which the administration deems necessary to meet the obligations imposed upon the country by the result of the war , and probably the enactment of a law to give a permanent territorial government To the Hawaiian islands. This covers all the important legislation which the Con gressional leaders expect to see enacted at this sesion. It is almost the unani mous sentiment of the members that no attempt should be made to legislate con cerning the possessions acquired by the war with Spain at this session. There are earnest advocates of the Nicaraguan canal bill , who will strive to secure its passage now , and they may possibly be successful , but neither it nor the pooling bill nor anti-scalpers' bill , eo.ch of which has strong friends , will be allowed to in terfere with the bills the passage of which is deemed absolutely necessary to prevent an extra session. The leaders at both ends of the capitol have put their heads together , and the work of the session is to be entered upon with the idea of avoiding an extra ses sion. AVith this purpose in view the ap propriation bills are to be given the road at both ends of the capilol and pressed through with all possible haste. An American soldier and a native cab man were killed by coming in contact witb a fallen electric wire in Honolulu the other day. An inquest developed the fact that the interior of the wooden insulating pin by which the wire was supported had been eaten away by ants , and the thin shell which remained had given way un der the stress of a wind storm. Attorney General Griggs has decidec that a person may draw money on a chech without a stamp , provided the check ii payable to himself , from his own funds or deposit in the bank in question. \ 

WORK OF CONGRESS. THE WEEK'S DOINGS IN SENATE ' AND HOUSE. A. Comprehensive Digest of the Pro ceedings in the Legislative Cham bers at Washington-Blatters that Concern the People. , In the House on Tuesday Mr. Cannon , chairman of the Committee on Appropria tions , reported the urgent deficiency bill for the army and navy. The President sent to the House the report of the Ha waiian commission , and Mr. Ilitt , chair man of the committee , introduced a bill in connection with the consideration of it , the whole matter being referred to the Committee on Territories. At 12:30 the House adjourned out of respect to the late T. .T. Xorthway of Ohio and W. F. Love of Mississippi. In the Senate Mr. Hale offered a bill for the erection of a monument ment to the officers and sailors who lost their lives by the explosion of the battleship - ' ship Maine in Havana harbor. Resolu tions from the Legislature of Vermont were read requesting that Roar Admiral Dewey be made admiral and that Captain Clark , commander of the Oregon , be given such rank as his merits demand. Mr. Vest offered a resolution objecting to. the proposed colonial system and reciting that the Government should acquire only coal ing stations in the orient , unless it shall % be the purpose of the United States to organize the far-off possessions into terri tories , and ultimately to bo admitted as States. The President sent a large num ber of nominations to the Senate , but they were all recess appointments with the exception of Powell Clayton of Ar kansas , whose rank has been raised to ambassador extraordinary and plenipoten tiary to Mexico. Senor Romero having announced that his Government had con ferred that distinction upon him. Mr. Cul- loui introduced a bill to provide for the territory of Hawaii. A brief discussion of the navigation laws was precipitated by the consideration of a bill amending 'those laws by the addition of a provision that foreign built vessels wrecked in the United States purchased by citizens of this country and repaired to the extent of three-fourths of their value shall be subject to forfeiture if they engage sub sequently in the coastwise trade of the United States. It was made a special order for Monday. In the House on Wednesday the nnti- scalping bill passed by a vote of 119 to 101. In the Senate no business was trans acted in open session. A few minutes af ter the Senate convened it went into ex ecutive session. At 2:15 business in open session was resumed , the death of Rep resentatives Northwny of Ohio and Love of Mississippi was announced and the Senate adjourned as a mark of respect to their memory. On Thursday the Senate held a short session and adjourned until Monday , af ter making the Niciraguan Canal bill the unfinished business before that body. Mr. Morgan called up the measure , whereup on Mr. Peltigrew moved to adjourn. This motion failed 13 yeas to 42 nays and the bill was brought forward. Adjourn ment was immediately taken. During the session Mr. Vest stated his opposition to the hurried manner of passing pension bills in the Senate , and gave notice that he would insist upon a quorum being pres ent when pensioiv bills were being acted upon. At the other end of the capitol the eneral deficiency appropriation bill wag passed , and the House adjourned until Monday. There are four Smiths in the present Congress , and there will be five in the next. Four of them are Republicans and three come from the State of Michigan , The only Democratic Smith is David Highbaugh Smith of Hodgensville , Larne County , Ivy. , who represents the district in which Abraham Lincoln was born. . " " * Mrs. Domini * of Honolulu , formerly queen of the Hawaiian Islands , arrived in Washington from San Francisco. She conies to present a claim to "Congress through the Secretary of State for the crown lands in the Hawaiian Islands , which are said to be valued at $4.000,000 and to produce an annual revenue of $100,000. * " - - Gen. Garcia and his Cuban associates are pleased with the President's message , and declare that his references to Cuban independence are in effect , if not in words , a recognition of the republic. It is doubt ful , however , whether the President in tended that such a construction should be placed upon his words. A communication received at the State Department from the consuls general at Berlin and Frankfort places the total value of all exports from Germany to the United States for the quarter ending Sept. 30 at $19,780,007. an increase over the same period of 1897 of $3,110,093. Bishop Hurst of the Methodist Church returns to Washington from a tour of the Pennsylvania cities , with assurances of contributions of $1,000.000 from' the rich Methodists of that State f6r the American university in this cily. v - - m m The President did not offer a plan for a government in the Philippines in his mes sage , simply because he desires first to ascertain how far the people are capable of self-government. Tiie Secretary of the Navy has added to the ornaments of his office the figurehead of the cruiser Cristobal Colon , which was destroyed in the battle off Santiago. _ * * A canvass of the Republican Senators discloses only two votes on that side against the ratification of the Paris treaty , those of Messrs.

ONLY A FEW PIECES OF GOLD LEFT. AMERICAN Sf.VOSHCOLONIES FARMERS IN SESSION. National Congress Begins Delibera tions at Fort Wayne. The farmers' national congress of the United States of America assembled at Fort Worth , Texas , in its eighteenth an nual session. Ex- Gov. William D. Hoard of Wisconsin presided , and among the delegates were i representatives of all 31 the States and terri tories of the Union and of several of the Canadian provinces. 1 After prayer by Rev. Alexander C. Garrett ot uallas , the visitors w. i ) . iioAitn. listened to addresses of welcome by Mayor 13. B. Paddock , Gov. Charles A. Culborson , President W. E. Skinner of the Fort Worth Live Stock Exchange and others. Responses in be half of the delegates were delivered by Secretary John M. Stall ! of Illinois. Wil liam Freeman of Maine and F. L. Max well of Louisiana. After the roll call by States President Hoard proceeded to de liver his annual address. A feature of the congress was the at tendance from some of the States of large numbers of associates to ro-enforce the delegates. Iowa had sixty-three persons , including the delegates , and Colorado had fifty-four. The annexation of the Philip pines was one subject which engrossed the attention of the delegates. The report oC Prof. Henry of Wiscon sin on the President's address was adopt ed. It recommended instruction in the principles of agriculture in rural public schools ; that commercial representatives for American agricultural products in for eign markets be provided ; that the best possible moans for the operation of steam ship lines direct to South America should be secured , and that laws against food adulteration be adopted. The report also urged farmers to uphold agricultural col leges and experiment stations and recom mended strong taxation laws for securing equity in taxation. Resolutions were adopted and ordered to be sent to Con gress favoring government aid in the con struction of the Nicaragua canal and gov ernment control of same , and for the de velopment of the beet sugar industry. 

PERILS AS TO CHINA. England and Russia Unable to Reach an Agreement. Right lion. Joseph Chamberlain. Brit ish colonial secretary , made now disclos ures the other night in n speech at Wake- field , Yorkshire. ! ! virtually stated the British Government had found it impossi ble to roach an agreement with Russia tout-hing China , and that France's plan of exasperation had prevented a settled policy as to Egypt. It was made evident , however , that an entente has boon reached with Germany that may make for peace and for extend ed trade ; but the significant fact was brought out lluit unless an agreement is effected with Russia there are dangers of grave complications. lie. however , left room to hope for a settlement. Mr. Chamberlain again referred with fooling to the cordial Anglo-American re lations. He quoted from the President's message to show that there is hope that England is not to stand alone for the ' 'open door" in the East , and again declar ed that an alliance between the two na tions would make them invincible. 

HOBSON REFUSES $50,000. Mcrriniac Hero Declines an Oflfer to Lecture , An offer of $50.000 for a number of lec tures has been refused by Naval Construc tor Richmond P. Ilobson. This offer was made by a New York lecture bureau , and the reason for his refusal was stated by Hobson to a friend. "Before the sinking of the Merrimac , " he said , "my lectures would probably have not been worth HO cents. The sinking of the Merrimac seems to have made them worth $50,000. The work that so sud denly raised my stock in literary trade was done in simple execution of my duty as an American naval officer. I did not feel that 1 had a riaht to use the perform ance of that duty for my financial better ment. I therefore declined the offer of $50,000. " Gold from Maria Teresa. The safe of the Spanish cruiser Maria Teresa , which has lain for some time in the Norfolk navy yard , has been opened , and found to contain bags of Spanish and American gold and silver coin. It is esti mated that the value of the treasure will reach $75,000. The money will be turned over to the proper officials , and the safe will be sent to the National Museum at Washington. Japan is preparing to drive the Russian troops from Corca , having landed large detachments of troops for that purpose. JAPAN MAY BUY PHILIPPINES. Offer of J20OOOOOOO for Group Made to President McKinley. Japan has offered this Government $200,000,000 for the Philippines. This information came through a Washington correspondent from a high source and is asserted to be official. It was further stated that this overture of Japan was met by the reply from the President that no negotiations affecting the disposition or control of the Philippines could be en tered into until after the conclusion of the treaty of peace at Paris. In direct connection with this story it is known that an influential Senator recently had a long talk with the President , at which the disposition of the Philippines was the main topic of conversation. The argument of the Senator was that , while he was opposed to the holding of the Phil ippines , he had now become convinced it would be necessary to hold the island of Luzon. lie told the President it would be to the advantage of the Government to dispose of all of the group except Luzon and that it would be the better plan to have several purchasers for the group. In other words , he would avoid all possible complications by letting Germany. Eng land , France , Japan and Russia into the gigantic auction sale. AVhen the peace protocol was negotiated by Cambon and the President the adminis tration's idea involved nothing more than the acquisition of Luzon. Since then the expansionist sentiment has grown rapidly in popular favor. The President may be only testing public opinion by giving cer tain gentlemen the impression that he favors the sale of till the islands except Luzon , or he may actually favor this dis position of the Philippine question. If seriously advocated the proposition will be hotly opposed by many Republicans and Democrats of influence. 

UNCLE SAM AND JOHN BULL. Demand for Joint Control of Nicara gua Canal Causes Irritation. The Nicaraguan canal question prom ises to be one of the leading questions in Congress this winter. The anxiety of the British to get in on the ground floor , as expressed by the London press , causes some irritation in Washington , ns Eng land's friendship for this country during the recent war is shoved under our noses as an argument for joint control of the proposed canal. England's claims for a share in the canal are based on the Bulwer-Claytou treaty , an agreement entered into before any one dreamed of a canal across that part of the isthmus. It is understood that Sir Julian Pauncefote has recently had a conference with Secretary of State Hay and has intimated that our exclusive con trol of the waterway violates the conven tion of ISoO. In administration circles the feeling is strong that no one shall interfere with this Government's declared intention to build the canal , and Secretary Hay probably told this to Sir Julian in a friendly but firm way. Later the United States may declare the canal neutral in war times , but the Government will do this in its own way and certainly not under pressure. .As to the Claytoji-Bulwer treaty , which England threatens to drag forth , the United States has two strong defenses against it. First , the United States can immediately annul the treaty. Second , under the treaty the United States can do anything she proposes to do without violating lating any of its terms , although the treaty has been abrogated by Great Brit ain's own acts. FOR MANILA VIA THE SUEZ. Expedition of Three Regiments "Will Soon Leave New York. The next regiments to start for Manila will embark at New York about the end of this month , and will go through the Suez canal , unless present plans fail. This expedition will consist of three regiments of regular infantry , distributed between two of the largest converted transports owned by the Government , with perhaps a convoy of two warships. The decision to ue New York as the point of embarkation instead of San Fran cisco was reached after a careful review of a number of considerations , chief among which was the urgency for haste. At the present time the Government is wholly without available transports in the Pacific ocean to meet the emergency. Albert Ham , a farmer of West Dres den , Me. , has an apple tree in his orchard which measures 9 feet 10 inches in cir cumference , 1 foot from the ground , and at the height of G feet the trunk branches into four limbs almost as large. The tree is over a century old , and has borne well each year for the forty-seven it has been in Mr. Ham's possession. Col. Hanna. at San Juan. Porto Rico says that codfish is the principal food ar ticle imported into that island , and that Nova Scotia dealers in codfish consider Porto Rico their best market. 

MONEY OP THE NATION ANNUAL REPORT OF SECRE TARY GAGE. Chief of the Treasury Department Dis cusses the Need of Banking Reform and the Necessity of Meeting : New Conditions. Secretary of the Treasury Gap has made public his report on the condition of the finances of the country and the work accomplished by his department during the year. It is an interesting document. Upon the subject of currency and banking reform he says : The arguments against government issues of paper money as a medium for commer cial exchanges have been fully made and need not bo repeated in detail. The pro posal to substitute bank issues for govern ment notes is opposed with many honest prejudices and assailed by bitter denuncia tions. The lirst arise from a failure to com prehend the true philosophy of a paper cur rency and must be patiently considered. The latter obscure the question by reckless statements , charging that all propositions for currency reform are bank conspiracies. If it be conceded that the legal-tender money issued by government does not pos sess the qualifications to make it a proper factor in the country's exchanges of prod ucts and manufactures , if the fact also be admitted that it Is a deranging and disturb ing factor in Its relation to industry and commerce , then the time has come to sub stitute for it a currency which will ade quately , economically and safely meet with the ever-growing needs of the country , rap idly developing , as it is , in the power ol production , in the number of its people ami the importance of its domestic and foreign trade. In answer to the question whether a bank note currency can be established which will be economical , adequate ant safe and serve the public needs in a bet ter way than is now served , the Secre tary points to the system in force in Canada. The facts set forth by the Comptroller re late exclusively to the proposition that the notes of a failed bank shall be a paramount Hen upon the assets for their full value be fore any rights accrue to other creditors. The issue of notes upon the general assets of natiofial banks may be made perfectly se cure without the requirement that the notes be a first lien upon their assets. It would only be neces ° nry to award to the notehold er the same ratable proportion of the assets which went to other creditors , and to pro vide that the amount required to pay the difference be obtained by an assessment up on all the national banks , collected ratably In proportion to their share in the circula tion of this character. The vital question is , What percentage of assessment upon this circulation would be required iu order to cover the losses to noteholders in the case of failed hanks ? The experience of the na tional banking system demonstrates that the assessment would be insignificant. The total circulation of failed banks out standing at the time of failure up to Oct. 31. 1897 , was ? : > 0,893Si7. The loss upon these notes , if the security for them had been .Impaired in the same degree as the security for other liabilities , would have been $ r , r > 79lG3 , or an annual average of about $16 ,000. This loss would have been made good by a tax of about one-twelfth of 1 per cent , per year upon the circulation of the solvent banks. A tax of one-fifth of 1 per cent , upon the average circulation of the national banks since the foundation of the systo-n would have paid such losses up to Oct. , .1. 1897 , and left a surplus of about ? 9,000,000 in the guaranty fund. Urges Former Measures. In ijy last report I ventured upon specific recommendations. These recommendations , If adopted and formulated into lav. * , would In my opinion be curative of the evils herein pointed out. In house bills Xos. 10,289 and 10,30. } are embodied a series of measures In some respects more meritorious. The meas ures herein proposed are the result of care ful study by expert and experienced men. "With some modifications the reasonable fruit of full discussion they would , I be lieve , meet the country's needs. I com mend the subject to the early and earnes' attention of Congress. On the point of fractional silver the re port contains this paragraph : The amount of fractional silver coin held by the treasury July 1 , 1S97 , was $16,201- 960 ; July 1 , 1898 , $12,070,690. This stock has tit present , Nov. 18 , been reduced to $7- 122,506 , much of which is so worn as to be unfit for circulation. The amount available , distributed among the several sub-treasuries , gives but small stock to each , and some da- uominations are exhausted. The Secretary of the Treasury should be authorized to re- coin this nncniTcnt stock and any such coin which may hereafter accumulate In the treasury , the difference between Its face value and the new coin It will make to be paid out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated. Further provision should be made to add to the stock of frac tional coin , and to that end it is suggested that tit" Secretary of the Treasury be au thorized 10 u. > e any .silver bullion now In the treasury for the coinage of such denomina tions as may be required from time to time to meet the demand from the different sec tions of the country. With an ever-increas ing population , whir-h will be added to in the near future by the acquisition of addi tional territory , the demand for fractional silver coin will be such as to make It essen tially necessary that the stock should be In creased. It is suggested that , at the proper time , action be taken by Congress to assimilate the currency of Porto Rico to that of the United States , so far and so rapidly aa this can be done without unduly disturb ing existing conditions and contract rela tions in Porto Rico. This , it is believed , can be accomplished by making customs dues in the island payable in American money , yet receiving the silver pesos and centavos at a fixed relation to our dollar. The revenues of the Government from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1S9S , were $494,333,953.75 , while the expenditures for the same period were $532,381.201.35. showing a deficit of $38- 047,247.150. As compared with the fiscal year of 1S97. the receipts for 1898 in creased $

HOARD TALKS TIONAL CONGRESS. Wisconsin's Ex-Governor , in Hig An nual Address , Dwells 011 the Intel lectual and Business Sides of Agri culture Farm Education a Necessity. Ex-Gov. Hoard of Wisconsin , president of the Farmers' National Congress , in hia annual address to that body at Fort Worth , said : Our agriculture is becoming nationalistic. This farmers' congress Is one of the proofs of this assertion. We are n longer a loosely Joined band of States , "discordant , bellig erent. " "Thank God , we are coming to see each other "face to face. " We are becoming cemented by railroads , navigable rivers , In terchangeable products , ami a more general commingling of our people. National legis lation Is taking on thought of this kind In ' the establishing of experiment stations , the enactment of laws for the better protection of agricultural products against the dishon est greed of men who would adulterate and counterfeit. We are just beginning to feel na a people . that agriculture Is an Intellectual us well as a manual pursuit ; that from the humblest tenant to the lordliest ranchman progress and profit depend on mental comprehen sion of the principles Involved , and an ener getic obedience to that knou ledge. Compre hension means Intellect , obedience means business. Some men are all Intellect and no \vork ; others all work and no Intellect. The true farmer unites both. He Is both a stu dent and a "doer of the word. " Some of the questions for this farmers' congress to ask Itself are : What can we do In an organized" way to get the farmers of this continent to see the necessity of more Intellect on the farm'In other words , what can we do to promote farm education ? What can this congress do to promote wise legislation In the State and national legis latures to this end' ; What can this congress do as a great force to arrest the tendency of the American farmer to destroy the natu ral fertility of his farm ? What can we do to arouse public opinion and the great educa tional forces of the country to the Import ance of teaching the elements of agricul ture in the primary schools of the laud ? Our present system of agricultural educa tion is an image with a head of brass , a body of Iron and feet of clay. We are di recting all our energies to the head and not the feet. Our common schools recruit the academy , the college and the university , and they , in turn , recruit every profession but farming. Our young men llee to the towns and cities because we have educated them to do so. Nearly ever } * European country Is putting forth strenuous efforts to stop this tendency by teaching the ele ments of scientific agriculture in the public schools. It can be done as easily as the teaching of the elements of scientific arith metic , or chemistry , or philosophy. A great host of farmers who were deprived of such teaching now find themselves barred from an understanding of much agricultural liter ature. As a consequence they turn from the agricultural college , the bulletin of the experiment station and the farm paper , which Is really worth everything to them. Like all other lines of human thought and action , the American farmer and his farm are going through a process of evolution. The manufacturer feels It , and his capital and enterprise can hardly keep pace with coming changes ; statesmanship feels it , for new and difficult problems of government constantly present themselves , and how to keep center and circumference in harmon izing growth is the problem of the day. The railroad magnate feels it and must bow to It. What is the subtle power that Is so mysteriously Jeavonn > S the whole lump ? It Is growth of knowledge among the people. Heretofore our vision has been directed al most wholly to the price we were to receive for our products. The present tide of evolu tion bears us In another direction. We can not control prices ; the market end of the question Is beyond the Individual reach or modification of any farmer. What can he do , what must he do , to increase his profit , for on that hangs his prosperity ? This must he do : He must realize that he Is no longer a crude producer ; he is a manufacturer. He must Invoke science , Invention , better sys tem , more thorough organization among his fellow farmers , more exhaustive study of the underlying principles of his business , improved methods , everything he can lay hold of , to contribute to a reduction of the cost of production. He is subject to the same economic laws as Is every other manufacturer. The world declares it will have cheap food and cloth- lug , for this Is the humane order of our civ ilization. The American farmer Is In the forefront of a merciless competition , for from the soil must come primarily all the food and clothing. He must furnish as good - as the best or he will lose the market. He must do this at a living cost and keep up the fertility of the soli , or he and his farm will both perish by the way. The demands of modern civilization are expensive. It costs more to live , educate his children and be a man among men than it d'd his father fifty years ago. There is but one road out - of the iliiiiculty n .I can see. He must put more thought into this question of the cost of production. Heretofore the cry has been more land , until the farm has become bigger than the farmer. This makes expensive farming. The necessities of the hour say m.-Vie the farmer bigger than the farm. The Farmers' National Congress Is needed as an organized body of opinion to promote as best It can national legislation In support of the Department of Agriculture. Our present Secretary of Agriculture Is doing what he can to introduce American food products into foreign markets and promote their consumption. That department should have the authority and means to employ , under its own direction , commercial agents in every food market In the world. Den mark sends its agents to England to receive , guard and look after Its shipments of butter and becon. Canada is doing the same. There is no reason better than traditional abstraction why the United States should not show the same good business sense. Be sides , there is a great trade awaiting us at our very doors in the sister republics of the southern part of this continent. Can we say or do anything here which will move our national legislature into work of a practical character , In the way of mall subsidies to a line of American ships sailing direct from southern ports to South American ports ? I hope we can. It Is a reproach to the practi cal statesmanship of the American people" that something lias not bc-en done of this haracter. - This congress can do something ia the way of aiding the greater efficiency of the State experimental stations , some of which are hardly more than lodging-houses for politicians. It can stand up and rebuke , in no measured tones , the prostitution of agri cultural necessities and progress to political favoritism. It can and should demand of the national government the taxation to extinction of all counterfeit food products. An imitation is a counterfeit , and a counter feit Is a fraud , and should have no rights before the law as against an honest product- of the farm.
