D. C, Dec. 10.— they can be reached for criminal libel ' I shall try to have them reached," said President Roosevelt, in speaking about '• "Those Americans who have been guil ty of infamous falsehood concerning 7 the acquisition of the property and the '.construction of the Panama canal » itself." ■ i. It was to the committee of one hun dred of the Lakes-to-the-Gulf Deep Wa terway association, headed by Govern or Deneen of Illinois, received by the f president in the east room of the White House, he made this declaration. I Governor Deneen had presented a copy of the resolutions adopted by the association and made a few remarks, to which the president replied as fol lows: ' '. "1 have felt, as the governor has so ■well put it, that no more important service could be rendered to this coun try than the building of the Panama canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific, and one thing I am proud of in connection with the building of that canal is that there has not been legiti mate cause for the breath of scandal connected with any feature of the pro ceedings. - - *.•-•*■' *"Wo. have • cause to be ashamed of only one set of Americans, who have been guilty of infamous falsehood con cerning the acquisition of the place and the construction of the canal itself.

CROMWELL SAYS EDITOR OF INDIANAPOLIS NEWS MADE FALSE STATEMENT IN PAPER NEW YORK, Dec. 10—William Nel son Cromwell authorized today the fol lowing statement: "My attention has been railed to a statement issued by the editor of the Indianapolis News, when he attempted to reply to the charge made by Presi dent' Roosevelt that certain statements made In the Indianapolis News both be fore and since the recent election and relating; to the purchase of the Panama canal by the United States were false and untrue. The president said: I " 'The News gives currency to the charge that the United States bought from American citizens for J40,000,000 property that cost these citizens only J12,000,000. The statement Is false. The United States did not pay a cent of the J40.000,000 to any American citizen,' etc. "From the statement issued in reply by the editor of the News I quote the following: 'The only man who paid any attention to them (that Is the criticisms referred to, etc.) was Charles P. Taft, who did deny that he was in any way related to the affairs. We had no word from the president or Mr." Taft. The other men, such as Cromwell and Morgan, who were believed to have full Information In relation to the busi ness, said nothing.' Says He Denied Story . "And he attempted to justify the pub lication of the false statements appear ing in his paper by saying that they 'were based largely on statements of the New York World. Criticisms, which were made over and over again during the campaign were ignored until to day.' "The reply of the editor of the News furnished another proof of the justice of the president's characterization, for in the very journal under whose sheets he now takes refuge, namely, the New York World of October 3, 1908, appears an explicit and unqualified denial by me of the story referred to in which I used the following: 'We may expect during a heated political contest all kinds of stories which are not worthy of notice, but this one I wish to de nounce in the strongest terms as X lying fabrication, without a shadow of the truth in it. Neither I nor any one allied with me, either directly or indirectly, at any time or in any place in Ajnetica, or abroad, ever bought, sold, dealt in or even made a penny of profit out of any stocks, bonds or other securities of either the old Panama Canal company or the Panama Canal company, or ever received for the same a single dollar of the J40.000.000 paid by the United States. I make this most sweeping statement that language can convey.' "As everybody connected with the affair knows, I abstained from receiv ing the J40.000.000 in my own hands at Washington or New York, and the gen eral counsel of the company and myself arranged for the payment of the entire J40.000,000 direct from the treasury of the United States through the bankers of the government in the Bank of France at Paris to the credit of the liquidators of the two companies. "There It remained, subject to the order of the .liquidators until distributed j by them to the hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries, and not one dollar of it. ever came tot me or anyone in any way connected with me. Of course I do not refer to our regular compensation as nnnnatft" ' I Have you ■ an Incandescent Gas Lamp The sun itself gives the only light that beats it.

SOUTH HILL ST. • Both Phones Exchange 3 YOUNG MAN BELIEVED LOST IN FOOTHILLS _Hi_k__l§S_Bfe( * ?s_i ■ i FRED L. BICKFORD FEAR YOUTH MAY HAVE PERISHED FAMILY FINDS NO TRACE OF FRED BICKFORD Young Musician Wanders Away from Sanitarium —Father Offers Re ward for His Safe . Return Wandering about somewhere In the foothills near Sierra Madre, clad only in his underclothes and an overcoat, and wearing a pair of shoes; weak and emaciated from nervous breakdown and probably suffering intensely from exposure to the chill night air, Fred L. Bickford, a vocalist and musician of more than ordinary ability, may have succumbed to hunger, thirst and exhaustion, and perhaps lies dying In some lonely spot In the mountains. Young Bickford disappeared from the Downey avenue sanitarium early Mon day morning. He had been placed there by his parents, Rev. and Mrs. L. F. Bickford, 6032 Monte Vista street, the previous day. They thought the quiet and rest afforded by the place would restore him to former self. The young man came to California about a year and a half ago, hoping the climate would build up his health, which had broken down by overwork while attending the Oberlin college. For several months he was leader of a choir at one of the churches at Long Beach. A short time ago he engaged In the grocery business with a friend, and worry over business matters broke down his health and brought on nerv ous prostration. Bickford arose early Monday morn ing. A nurse saw him emerge from his room and walk down the hall with a blanket over his shoulders. The , at tendant, thinking the patient, was go ing to the back part of the building and would be gone only for a few mo ments, called him back and made him put on an overcoat. Bickford passed down the corridor and when the nurse went to search for him he had gone. That was the last seen of him. , . The young man is a graduate of Oberlin college. Ohio. While attending school he was prominent in athletics and also In other college affairs. His mother thinks his love for exercise and open air caused him to leave the sani tarium In hopes the outing would bene fit his health. Mrs. Bickford scouts the idea that her son has wandered to some secluded place and ended his life. She places no credence In the theory that he wan dered into Eastlake park and ended his life by jumping In the lake. She says he has had nervous breakdowns before, but was never melancholy. Rev. Mr. Bickford yesterday an nounced that he would give a reward of $50 for the return of his son. HERALD'S CHRISTMAS EUND EXCEEDS $900 (Continued from Paire One) distribution to be held December 25 at the new Y. M. C, A. building and at Simpson auditorium. The old store of the Wright-Callender company at 323 South Hill street, fur nished through the courtesy of that firm, is the central depot where all dis carded clothing suitable for presenta tion, toys, picture books, canned goods, games, comforts and "blankets, dolls and Teddy bears, shoes, stockings, gloves, aprons and dozens of other things dear to children can be depos ited with the committee in charge. All afternoon persons attracted by the charitable enterprise Inaugurated three weeks ago brought their goods into the store, expressing thanks to the management for carrying out this happy festival idea for Christmas time. The workers remarked that only be cause so few persons really know that families with children needed help was the Christmas work so far short of what the committees hoped and ex pected the people of Los Angeles and vicinity would do. They should come to the rescue more generally and more liberally In view of the fact that pos sibly 2000 little guests will partake of the people's hospitality that day. Guests That Day The dinner is In no sense an Indica tion that distress is general in Los An geles. It is a treat by fortunate dwell ers to those less fortunate—to the boys and girls who in every large city are likely to be overlooked by Santa Claus If concerted efforts are not 'made to see that their stockings and stomachs are filled that festal day. •-■,: n Women and girls who desire to assist ln the reception work, in the details of committees, ln serving at the feast and in other features of the celebration should send in their narrfcs, addresses and telephone numbers at once to the Santa Claus editor of The Herald. Those who know worthy families which need assistance should also send particulars. Unless the number of guests Is ap proximately known at least two days before the festival the committee will be handicapped; hence all the little boys and girls in town who expect to attend the celebration, or who fear Santa Claus will overlook them, should write at once to The Herald.

LOS ANGELES HERALD: FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 11. '1908. WILL ADVANCE FREIGHT RATES TARIFF ON ALL EASTBOUND TRAFFIC TO BE RAISED WESTBOUND CLASS FIGURES TO BE UNDISTURBED Bulk of Shipments from Pacific to Atlantic Moves Under Commodity Charges Which Are Greatly Increased WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—Transcon tinental freight tariffs beginning Janu ary 1 next will be advanced on all east bound traffic both by rail and by water. The class rates on westbound traffic will remain as they are now. The commodity rate on west-bound traffic from Atlantic seaboard points to Pacific coast terminals will be mc i eased approximately 10 per cent. On east-bound class rates there will will be a decrease on first-class ship ments from $3.70 per 100 pounds to $3 per 100 pounds. On class rates in Chicago and Central Traffic association territory from the Pacific coast terminals there win be a decrease on first-class shipments from $3.40 per 100 pounds to $3 per 100. This will equalize the class rates on both east and west-bound traffic. The east-bound commodity rate from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic sea board points will be advanced about 18 per cent on the average, some of the Items being as high as 60 per cent ad vance and some as low as 6 per cent- It is notable that the bulk of the traffic moves under the commodity rates, which, show a decided Increase. This announcement was made by the Interstate commerce commission. Tlte tariffs provide that the rates, be tween Pacific coast terminals and the points named in the east shall be the sum of the local carload rate. This will have the effect of increasing tho rates very materially. The commission lias no authority to prevent the riling of any rates the rail ways may see flt to put into effect. It is likely, however, that a formal com plaint will be filed with the commis sion. The commission then might in vestigate. -.- '• .' -> ■ —,—i OFFERS REWARD FOR HOLDUP MEN Story Is Circulated That Three Ban. dits Secunred $16,000 In Rob ' bery of Great Northern Train SPOKANE, Wash., Dec. 10.—A re ward of J6OOO, in which the Great North ern railroad and the United States gov ernment share equal responsibility, is offered for the arrest and conviction of the three bandits who held up Great Northern passenger train No. * near Hillyard last night. The men have been traced back to Spokane by the sheriff's officers and a dragnet has been laid all over this city and surrounding country.

WALL STREET HATES HIM, SAYS ROOSEVELT Roosevelt Declares Financial Men Would Have Every Lion Do His Duty When He' Hunts In Africa ATLANTA, Ga„ Dec. 10.—In a Wash ington special printed this morning In the Constitution, President Roosevelt is quoted as asserting that Wall street hates him. "When I go to Africa," said the pres ident in talking to a party of Georgians who called upon him yesterday, "Wall streets expects every lion to do his duty. Wall .street hates me with fervid sincerity, not because of any general denunciation of railroads and corpora tions, but because I have done things." The president Is quoted as saying that he does not plead for a centralized gov ernment, but for recognition of the power already vested in the national government, adding: "If congress will give me—and when I say me, I mean the president— national administration— power to secure a thorough supervision of the financial affairs of railroads, to regu late the issuance of stock, to prevent stock watering and to insure public ity of all their affairs, with a due re gard to legitimate trade secrets, it would settle the whole corporation question." Urging the necessity of permitting reasonable combinations of capital, the president is quoted further as saying: "If you should dam up the Missis sippi river you would cause a flood and accomplish nothing thereby, but you can guide and restrain this Immense water force by means of levees."

I OIL TRUST GAIN IS 100 PER CENT KELLOGG SHOWS PROFITS OF OCTOPUS ENORMOUS READS FIGURES PROVING COM. PANY DOUBLES COST Government Has Barnsdall Contract Demanded of Archbold and Ex pects to Prove Pittsburg Man Is Figurehead NEW YORK, Dec. Morltz Ros enthal, attorney for the Standard Oil company, in charge of the defense of the suit brought by the government to dissolve the oil company, has turned over to Frank B. Kellogg, the federal prosecutor, the contract which had been demanded by Mr. Kellogg from John D. Archbold, when he was on the witness stand recently, and by which the government hopes to prove that N. Barnsdall of Pittsburg, supposed own er of the Barnsdall Oil company, is but a figurehead and that the Barnsdall company belongs to the trust. From the records of the Standard's exhibits Mr. Kellogg yesterday read figures showing that in 1595 the Stand ard manufactured 40,000.000 barrels of refined oil, with a net earning of $24, --078,000, or a net profit of 60 cents a barrel; that in 1896 It manufactured 64,000,000 barrels,of oil, with a net profit of $83,000,000, or $1.30 per barrel. "Do you think a general rise of com modities Justified a profit of more than 100 per cent in any one commodity?" asked Mr. Kellogg. "Economists have had a hard time determining what a reasonable profit Is," responded Prof. Johnson. • The witness could not be Induced to say he thought the profit of 100 per cent and more was outside the bounds of reason. Mr. Rosenthal objected to the gen eral tenor of Mr. Kellogg's questions, contending it had not been shown that the $1.30 a barrel profit came exclusive ly from the manufacture of oil. SHOWS OIL TRUST CONTROL - OVER BARNSDALL COMPANY NEW YORK, Dec. 10.—The missing contract of the Standard Oil company, which explains the loan made by the corporation to N. Barnsdall of Pitts burg, is in the hands of Frank B. Kel logg, the government prosecutor, con ducting the government's suit to dis solve the Standard Oil company which is in progress here. The contract had been demanded by the government while John D. Arch bold was on the stand recently, and yesterday it was turned over to Mr. Kellogg by Morris Rosenthal, after having been obtained in Pittsburg from the Pittsburg Trust company. Two contracts covered the transaction of the loan of J7.500.000, and the secur ity given by Mrs. Barnsdall was the bulk of the stock of the Barnsdall Oil company, mortgages on coal lands and rights in Oklahoma. These same se curities William A. Rockefeller testi fied on the witness stand a year ago were practically worthless ln his opin ion. This made Mr. Barnsdall's prop erty the trust's, and the government counsel hopes to show that he was thus 'practically a dummy furnished with funds to build up the business of the Standard. CASTRO LANDS ONLY AS PRIVATE CITIZEN Claims President of Southern Repub. He Said He Had Come to France to Make Set. tlement BORDEAUX, Dec. 10.—The landing of President Castro of Venezuela at Pauillac was surrounded with a certain air of mystery. As soon as the steamer had docked a French commissary went on board and Insisted on speaking with the Venezuelan president at once. He said he had come only to inquire, on behalf of the government, concerning Castro's intentions, and as Castro had replied that he came to Europe for the settlement, he would be allowed to land as a private citizen. The president was greeted with the greatest enthusiasm by the Venezuelan colony. The party then rode in auto mobiles to a hotel. President Castro went down the gangplank of the Guadelupe escorting his sister. The party proceeded to the private car where the 1 president re ceived a number of French merchants doing business with Venezuela. Both at Pauilliac and Bordeaux President Castro was presented with flowers. The police are watehimr a third-class passenger on the Guadelupe whose at titude toward the Venezuelan president Is considered suspicious. This man is a Syrian and Is one of a group of trad ers coming from Venezuela.
