An attack of tyi hold feyor usually leaves one with an enormous appetite. The wasted body cries out for food material to repair the toss of body tissues. If care is not used, the weakened diges tive organs may be overwhelmed before they have become strong. There' Is no food that has the tlssue bulldlng and energy-producing qualities equal to Grape-Nuts. This food is picdigested-the organs ara relieved of the necessity of digestion If it la concentrated-affording much nourish ment with little bulk; contains ail the ei sentlal food elements for repair and energy. It Is therefore valuable under conditions of health as well as cortvalesence. A Calif, young lady learned the truth about Grape-Nuts. She writes: "About four years 'ago I had a severe attack of typhoid fever. After recover ing I had a wild- longing for food which nothing seemed to satisfy. "I tried the best of everything, but waa always Weak and hungry. A change to a milder climate did not mend matters food did not agree with me. "A friend persuaded me to try O rape Nuts. To my great surprise I did "not ex perience that hungry feeling between meals. It waa a great relief and I kept on eating it with great benefit. "Orape-N'uts not only relieved that wild craving for food, but made me atronger In mind and body relieved the old head aches, weakness, strengthened my nerves so that I- waa easily able to do my work. "I have never tired of Grape-Nuts as one doea of most cereal foods.

OPENING ADDRESS BY AUGUST BELMONT rrrsldent of Kinder of Katlaaal Organisations to Appolat Com mittee to Investigate Child Labor Situation. NEW TOnK, Dec. lZ-The National Civic federation began Its fifth annual meeting at the Park Avenue hotel today. There were about 200 persons present, In cluding a number of leading men In com merce, Iarxr, the professions and other walks of life. The meeting was called to order by Au gust Belmont, the president. In an address Mr. Belmont viewed briefly the two topics for discussion at the-first day'a session, namely, -"Child Lalwir" and "Government, by Injunction." The discussion of the two questions, which folhrwed, waa participated In by a number of men well qualified to speak thereon. The annual banquet of the association was held nt the Park Avenue hotel tonight. The meeting will be continued tomorrow. Aan-ust Uelmoat Presides. August Belmont, president of .the federa tion, In his opening address urged the ap pointment of a committee to investigate the problems growing out of the accumulation of great fortunes. This subject will be con sidered tomorrow. "No subject will bring greater good to this country if correctly solved," said he, "or greater harm if, for wise and Just taxation, punitive spoliation and the destruction of our boundless spirit of enterprise through hampering regulations be substituted." ' "Government by Injunction" was char acterised by Mr. Belmont aa "another burn ing subject to be discussed." He said he was not sure that President Roosevelt's proposition for compulsory Investigation of industrial disturbances in advisable. He doubted the wisdom of such Interference, but the greatest Justification for such policy would be In the case of quasi public corporations. Mr. Be-lmont also called attention to that portion of President Roosevelt's message wherein the president denounced the effort to prohibit all combination of capital. Government by Injunction. The federation then took up government by Injunction. CarJ Spelling, general at torney for the American Federation of La bor, said that In labor disputes Judges have sent foi . decrees which were special leg islation and have paralysed and rendered abortive all the efforts on the part of tho labor side of that dispute. An injunction. he said, should never be granted except to protect property or property rights. He declared that It was seldom that strikers ever resort to actual violence, but they frequently appoint committees to help the police preserve order.' The speaker said the Paree bill, which li before the congress, embodies the proper and legitimate demands of organized labor, Walter Drew, commissioner of the Na tlonal Iron Erectors association, In replying to Mr. Spelling, replied that the latter's argument was fallacious in that It went to prove that Injunctions should not Insu- in any case, while he Sought to prove that they should Issue to protect nothing but purely physical property and physical prop erty rights. . Mr. Drew said that "separated from any question of defect in the law or Its ad mln'stratlon, the demand that temporary Injunctions should not Issue In labor con troversies because a demand that the prac tice . of our courts shall be changed to I grant special immunity and privileges to ; one particular class openly and avowedly engaged In warfure with another class.' Child Labor Question. Samuel tacCune Lindsay, secretary of the national child labor committee, said was Impossible to e- t,gcrate the real ex tent or the real cvi. of child labor. H believes that other forms of legal protec lion than absolute prohibition are aeeded for the greater part of the 2,000,000 chll dren between the ages of 10 and IS, now engaged In gainful occupations. Recent re ports show that the number of children i in specially harmful occupations is lncrutfr'.ni luster than the population. Mr. Lindsay said the BeveridgelParsons bill, recently Introduced in congress for national child labor law, would cut the heart out of the child labor evil at a single blow. Mr. Mitchell said In part) "We want now to change the law so that there children can play before ever they are obliged go to work. Thousands of boys went work when they were 8 years old; many others between 10 and 12. 1 regret that th operators, while trying to raise the stand ard have seen fit to fight the educational conditions." John Gulden,1 president . of the Textll Workers of Fall River, istated that when some four years ago, he was commissioned by the American Textile Workers of America to study the conditions In South Carolina, and he contemplated visiting a certain mill, was warned from doing so by the statement that the owner had sworn to shoot the first northern man that came down there- Interfering With his help. Mr. GomperB, the last speaker, Said that when he sent James Leonard of New Or leans to one of the towns of Mississippi, for the purpose of trying to make an In vestigation of the conditions of the cotton operatives there, Leonard was quietly In formed that unless he left the state at once he would be escorted to the state line by the police. "One of the representatives of the city government, I believe the mayor," added Mr. Gompers, "appointed a gentleman to entertain Mr. Leonard on the train on his way to beyond the border of the state." A resolution was adopted providing that the presidents, the NatlonnI Association of Manufacturers, the American Federatl of Labor, the General Federation o: Women's Clubs, the National Educational association, the National Economic asso ciation, the "Nations! Conference of Chari ties and Corrections and the National Child Labor committee be Invited to name seven members to act with a like committee of the National Civic Federation aa a com mission to make a thorough investigation of the whole subject of child labor In the United States. Charles A: Moore, president of the New York City Federation, presided at the ban quet this evening. Archbishop Ireland, In a speech said, In .1 part: This Is an American Institution. If this meeting that we have witnessed today had taken place in any country of llurop there would have been a riot before ht n-.eetfna; closed, and when one man would stand up and contradict another the other would at -once have challenged hi mto a duel. This Is one of the beautiful efTet.ts of our American democracy.
