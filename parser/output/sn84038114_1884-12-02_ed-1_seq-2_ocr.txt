It seems now, however, that our buoolic neighbor has changed its mind, hatunlay'k issue the people are called upon to mit petitiuns Into circulation, asking * th»U,<*gi8l»ture to flx a day in February for an election, when the people of the State shall be permitted »' the polls to say whether they do do not desire the liquor trade licensed in the State." As our temperance friend* h»re done all they possibly could to make the legislature solidly Democratic, and did succeed by their vole* iu other States in securing the election of a Democratic President, say the Democrats are under the dee)e est obligations to them. To them of course the temperance men will go, and of conrse the Democratic Legislature of Delaware will pay the temperance debt they owe. by all means let the tern p-rance people petition, aud may we he , around when the prayer of the peti tioners is granted. mure W e would bis iu can belief foreign is in check 1'res bike Utah. miu b**e Iu or and mand the party made and in w ■ ami are • of wan coal th <1 usTiCE was almost cheated out of itn victim by the nearly successful at tempt of the negro boy Howard Sul , the murderer of Ella Watson, to escape from jail at Hridgtou, New ,ler aey,on Thursday of last week.

Pre-ddent Arthur's last Annual toes* sage to Congress is a seusible, business paper, and proceeds in a straight-fur* ward business-like manner to discuss the various topics bearing more direct ly upon the business and financial af fairs of the Government.. H* congratu lât«» the country for the good order ai d |Hiace that were preserver! during au exottiug Presidential election, and praises the temper ami loyalty of the t»eople while patiently and quietly awaitiug the announcement of the re mit. to of He thinks though that it would be wise in Congieaa *»> pa«* » bill to regu late more definitely the counting of electoral vote. In this the President but reffecta the sentiment* of the best ele ments of the people. The present mode of counting the electoral vote, bangs a* a perpetual menace over the eountry in every closely contested Presidential election. An important treaty is that made during the recess of Congress with the authorities of Nica ragua, by which the construction of a canal, railway and telegraph line across the Nicaragua territory. This will secure a passage across the isth mus that, routine ts North and South America independent of English or French complications. It will make a short cut to the Pa cific, avoiding the turning of Caj*e Horn, and it will bring the trade of South American Pacific States close to the Gulf States of our own country. The President is now as ever opp<»eed to the unlimited coinage of silver dollars aud of the issue of silver certificates, and wisely recommends the redemp tion of the trade dollar at a slight ad vance over ita bullion value. Though there will be a hearty concurrence in the President's suggestion to call in the trade dollar », the proposition to redeem them at a slight advance over their bullion value will hardly be received with hearty acceptance. The popular opinion prevails that whatever the gov ernment stamps aa a dollar should be redeemed as a dollar. That govern ment that would become a broker, aud »have the face of its own paper could hardly be called honest. The President again, as at a former seasion,Jreoommends the^abolitiou of all excise taxes except ou distilled spirits. This action he thinks will sufficiently reduce the revenue that is creating a large surplus iu the Treasury, and which is objectionable, until such time a« it can be better asjertained where tariff reduction can be made without injury to the industrial interests of the ua ion. for ill Un The Dreaideut beartily agrees with bis Secretary ol the Treasury that iu incentive to place capital In Ameri can steamships the Government should liberally pay such steamships for mail transportation, lie is emphatic iu his belief that unless this ia doue our foreign carrying trade will remain aa it is in the hands of foreigners.
