Original Poetry IMPROMPTU LINES #. On the Doath of a Young Soldier. "Bring flower?," the Soldier Boy is dead, "Bring flowers,'' to wreathe liis curly head, "Bring flowers," to lay on l.is pale, fair browb Fevered and wasted and whito like snow. "Bring flowers," —"Faded Flowers" ho loved— From out the grove lie often roved; "Bring flowers," and Joss them on his bier, "Bring flowers," but softly —tlio dead lies here, j Ho sleeps where Atlantic lashes the shore, And its wild waves surge forever more ; For on its proud bosom be breathed his last, And his funeral knell was the rushing blast. He sleeps 'neath the frown of the gloomy fort, lie sleeps so calmly thnt nothing short Of the trumpet's lilast in tliat last great day, That shall summon us all from earth away, Will awake him.. Oh! then wa shall see Him start from his tomb so happy and free, To his home on high, so lovely and bright, Where all is day and never more night. He sleeps lii.s last sleep, let him rest 'neath the sod, All stained though dt he with hi? comrades' life bipod 1 laet him rest! Let him rest! lie has gone to his God, Whose mercy and wisdom are boundlessly good. ' (SI!) c Schoolmaster Crl br o a Ti.

The Lots ate rucg stive, and of a nature to awaken the soli citude of every frieud of tho free schools of our state. The schools cost the same whether the attendance is good or had. Teachers' services, fuel and con tingencies, school house ■ and repsirfiig, all cost ex actly as much. The tax payers pay for the educa tion of all tho children in the state, whether they avail themselves of it in full, in part, or not at ad. Ileticc, unless pupils attend the scbo li, and receive their houdllts, 1 the cost of their In'trmsrloii is money thrown away. It is plain, too, that 'lie loss w.H lie in the same proportion tliat thov tail to avail them selves nl the blessings ol the schools.

Some Interesting inferences might be draw i from . the figures just given, but space will not permit.— ! ■J'lie grave fact is, however, manifest, that only 63 per cent, of the pupils enrolled in tbe public schools actually receive their benefits; and tluit of the S3 - j 00D,600 annually expend (1 to educate them, 3-3 per ! c -nt. is, in effect, thrown away.

Wo have already remaiked that, some of ths : causes of irregular attendance sre providential in their nature. They do not, however, it is thought, ; opeiatc to ntiv considerable extent, nor inteif rei nppreoiably with the Working of our system. But I asine (mm tberc the causes ure numerous. Every] defect of our system is a cuise. Irregular attend- J ance its. If is a cause. Like many other evils, it l propigatos its, Uiitd. Pupils are often absent from; mere lutiit, or liectnsn they wore absent yesterday, i atid da not k new their 1 .•sauits for to-day. U natiraotive school bnv.ses and grounds en use Ir j regular nttendauce. Buildings, dingv, dirty and i (lark, situ ited, perhaps, on some I leak Mil ton, j without n tree to shield them from the miirtnrer run or winter blost, present n'ontltnclions to bti/b'-eved joyous children. They do iiot tike to go to school in i such houses, and will use cve*y excuse to stay sway. 1 It as is ton often the case, they are without maps, ' charts, blackboards, apparatus, ventilation or com-1 1 forta'de seats, the case Is Mill worse. According j to the State Superintendent's cUirial report, two ' thirds of the scbonl bouses in the State ro unfit for their purpose, cither radically or for w.at of: suitable repairs, llence, about two thirds (nearly j 4(10,000.) of the children of the Stat- must attend school, if they attend at all, in unsnitahlo Imii.lings. | A l r g's number of these sulfur from beat it Hunted , near the stove, anil from coid if fir freiu it. Tic y must br.ullio impure air, and occupy suits that] j would have served their purpoi-i better il tiny had hneti meant expressly for instruments of toiture. ,Is it strange then tint many slum! 1 stay away of ; their own accord, or he kept away by their pir tits? Is it strange that sumo parents are unwilling to let j their children ruin their health by going t-> school i in such school-houses. It it not strange. Tho on- : J ly t.ooder is that there aio not mare; for wo have I reason to think that only a smail i>i t ol the irn g-' ] ular attend nice iu tie State, is caused by such cot:- j sidcration on tbe part of parents. Too oil' n they i | do not trouble themselves to ascertain whether! | school-houses arc comfortable or not. On l his, as j : on too many other questions cwnecto 1 with tha ' schools, parcels are curch sr and itidUTcretil; but if | they were alive to tlio importance of this subj ret, | bid School-houses would be one of tbo most fiuitlul j cans-s i f irregular attcmlanco. j 2. Tlij nhoituogs of the uoiml sch <ol term is I another cause. Its brevity would appear to be a ' rosson why no time should he 1 i.>t. Bill parents are j tco often gl'ldcd in this matt .r by their children If tb< y do not wish to go to school they ur> aliow ] ed to stay at home. The time is often too siiort I to itubue them with a love of study; th-y dislike ; it, and sc z; on every cxcut; to In ulisont. Mind m 'Voa most smoothly ri beslen channels. The ' child who bis never studied, will not at first h i< lute ! ly to love study. It is only what tbo min i bis be i come accustomed to intellectuil effort tb ,t such j effort is a pleasure. Before it cm become so, be ! fore the pupil is lairly identified with tbo school, or ] interested iu his studies the school Is out. an., be is i away to th academy, tbo farm or tlio workshop.— | 110 knor # this.

What was to lie done? Some plan u .vor thought of by the Legislufiiru, must bu found, or the whole system wou'd lall to t the ground useless and Impracticable. Aci i lug upon the well known principle tint no single ] provision shall in; allowel to render i'lopcrativu j uud null the whole nactmcnt, the Statu Sup-inn -1 tendent Ueteriuined to issttu what is ktiowti as I temporary certificates.

Tint sum aid surely w-s not too hit It; ami wht'e such a leg pro pvrlioti of our teachers are hyh w It, the i niiiniiui setoffs can never secure the cnliletice ol all class es di the community, or tlio rogulir ultendanco of , tncit children. It is adufltted that ui ny liolii-ss ef : temporary Ci rtifleutes give general sitisfictiun, that they are rapidly fitting th uise'Ves for greater use fulness, and will evcutnilly become ornaments to I their professions; hut whilst nitre 'ent.us of our teachers are below the 1 gff standard, ininy of | th in minors, iuteinlivglo enter upon other pur suits us soon as they aro old enough, ami .whilst a large number of them confessedly uro not giving sattslactien to their patrons we cannot shut out ejus to tbe limoiliurng conclusion thai incompetent teachers are cue of tlio most ituilful souices of 1.- ' regular attendance. ] 4 l ire perversetiess of pupfls will alw ays cause ' some irregularity, however lavorable llie circum stances by wliicti llrey are surrnuiuled. All ' clitidreu are not angels, nor are they likely to be, 1 tire opinin of parents to the contrary notwith- I standing. Nor will all children love school and ! study even iu llietr must favorable u>peci* Give litem a palace lot a school-house, n I'age, a IS tekoraliiiiti or an Arnold lor u teuelier, and pa rents anxious tor tiieir vvblfare and progress; still | they will hate bonks and schools, and try every ; means in their power to avoid them- Lor such irregularity there is no remedy, not can there tie white human nature is what it is. 5 The causes tinw far mentioned are, rn our opinion, only secondary in their nature. '1 he great primary cauve is broader, und lies deeper. It is toilll l l 111 die INUIKPKItKNCB —tO 11SC 110 tlllfsll er lenns —every where pervading the putilie illind ou die subject of educudoti. Our people have forests to tell, railroads to build, lanns lo buy; in short, 

MONEY to MAKE, and can interest themselves but little on tins subject, ol such vital interest to them. They are busy with projects til at Will mal'.e the dollars pogle in their pockm.-; and ei die nil absorbing pursuit ol these, 100 ode.i overlook die intellectual weilure ol dieir children,, liu-uuess, polities, and religion are every 'where subjects ol conversation. Men iai.\ and SPEAK ol lliesp; but of education a vast majority of our people speak but little, and think still less. Ootids subject there is almost universal apathy. Remove this arid every other cause of irregular attendance, and every evil ot our system will disappear as certainly as the removal of cause destroys effect. That this is the steal pronary cause , is shown, we think by the school statisticso[ the state. H incompetent teachers, a short school term, and unsuitable school-houses, were the cbiel causes, tbo attend ance should improve us these improve, bitch, however, is not the fact. All admit a vast im provement in all these, during the past eight iears, and yet tire average attendance is but little belter than before. Only one conclusion can l e drawn; the public tnind is not keenly alive to the success of the common schools. 111. The true way to remedy an evil is to re move its cause. This is often, though not always beyond the teachers control. He can do much to correct the evil by h personal interview with parents, and by calling their attention to the ru i reus consequence* of their children* irregular attendance. If the subject be approached in a proper spirit, pome parents, at least, will see the reasonableness of his views,and aet accordingly. Not. however, that the teacher should be requi red to do this; for in our opinion, his duties are not to secure attendance, but to teach those who present li.emsehves. lint in the choice of two evils tie will often find this the less, and should therefore, choose it. Good effects are sometimes realized by compelling pupils to make up all lessons lost by tbair absence, unless they can present a good excuse; but this, too, imposes roach additional labor no the teacher, ami can only be effective where the pupil is ab-eut of his oivn choice. These and ainn ar expedients may dp some temporary good; but remedies lobe generally and per na.tently effective, must be (I*lolo comprehensive in their nature. Remedy pvery delect of our system.

Mr. Allen, of 111., risked, lnt failed lo olitarnj leave to offer a resolution instructing the Cap niitlce on tlie Judiciary to inquire into the al leged right of the Federal government to set at defiance the Constitution, laws and sentiments of the people of Illinois in importing negroes into that ahd to consider what action is' necessary to bring about the doportation of tho said negroes. Mr. Richardson, of Ullnois, proceeded to re view lbs message, observing that it was remark able for what it says, and still more remhrkal' lile for whnt omits. The one-half of the twen ty-one pages is devoted to the negro. There was no page, no sentence, no line as to bravery and good conduct of those in the field fighting t.) maintain the flag and the Constitution and the Union. No sorrow was expressed for the lamented dead—no mention made of the maim ed and wounded; no sympnthy was expressed for Ihe widows of the suffering orphans mado in the progress of this war which could have been avoided by honorable compromise, if tho President and his friends hud desired to avoid civil war. The sum and substance of the message was to tax the white man, mortgage him and. his posterity forever, to free, feed, clothe, and col onize the negro. When our people, anxious for the restorrtion of the Union and the retnrn of pence, look to the, message to see what infor mation they could get upon that subject, they could draw only by by inference that the war would end in thirtv-scven years, provided all the President's plans were adopted by Congress and the people. Hut then the Prosident gave the consolation that most of us would be dead by that time. Every proposed change of the Constitution was for the negro. No proposition was made to change the Con- i stitution for the benefit of the white, or to per-' petunte the Union of these States by preserv ing the Constitution of the country. The people will, in due time, compromise for the benefit of while men and not for negroes. He had hoped, that the President would PO conduct Itimsolf that he might accord to him his support; but lie had hoped against hope. The President had violated the pledges he mado in his Inaug ural Address by the Proclamation of the 22d of September. In the course of bis remarks, lie said that the effect of the Proclamation was not to re store the Union, hut only to free tho negro. Reviewing the military events of the year, ho vindicated the course of Gen. McCleJlan, say ing that he was removed, not because lie was incompetent, but beeaus* he refused to endorse the Emancipation Proclamation. The Republicans have been running the House and the departments of Government for the benefit of the negro. Speaking of the bill which was paseed to-day, indemnifying the President and others f-om the consequence* (rf suspendintr the privclepe of the writ of habi com". he raid the Courts will not sanction this reek if ?s and .tyrannical vxerciso of power. The* dominant, parte, he charged, has violated the C'omtitiidou and the law.
