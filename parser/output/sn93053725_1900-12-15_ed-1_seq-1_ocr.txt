tVOL XI V XO ft WATERBUIIY, CONN, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1900. PRICE TWO CENTS. i ALWAYSTKESAME England's Opinion of the United States and Ker People. VE HAVE NO GREAT MEN At Least, None of Conspicuous Merit, so Says the Daily Mail lear Boot Christmas Gaiety in London Goes on, Despite the War In South Africa - - Americans Have, It Is Said, Formed a Corner in Polar Dogs. London, Dec 15. "The United States have many able men, lr.it no oue of conspicuous merit." This statement appears in the Daily Mail year book, issued to compete with "Whittaker's Almanack," under thevsection devot ed to the world's chief statesmen. While it is not an inspired or a partic ularly erudite publication, it unfortu nately represents the bulk of press and public opinion in England. Nothing so well explains the attitude cf the Eng lish pres.? toward American action in Nicaragua. China, and other quarters of the globe, as this crude revelation of its estimate of American public men. It is this underlying though seldom-expressed, btlief which permeates the editorials now so frequently de voted to the policy of the Washington government. How utterly this is at variance with the opinion of the for eign office and the highest government officials here is apparent from the fact that in almost every recent case where llie English papers have attempted to :idvise or to forecast the attitude of their government towards propositions suggested by the United States, they have taken exactly the opposite line fr&m the course eventually pursud by Lord Salisbury and the Marquis of Lansdowne. This lack of sympathy between the administration leaders and the administration papers seems to broaden daily. Hence, while the mass of English comments on the Nicaragua canal question undoubtedly represents the views cf a large section of the pub lic, it must not be considered in any way official, or even semi-official. A special cable dispatch from Wash ington complains that the London dis patches dealing with the Nicaragua canal do not give any indication of the views of Lord Lansdowne',' the Marquis of Salisbury or any authoritative per son. It may be said that Lord Lans downe has been given every opportu nity to communicate his views on the matter, but he has deGu:ieIy refused, remarking that he did not wish to at teiupt to interfere, covertly or other wise, in the formation of American -public or legislative opinion. He-has not even discussed the canal in his frequent conferences this week with Ambassador Choate. Great Britain's decision, doubtless, will be arrived at only after a cabinet conference. What Lord Lansdowne will advise his fellow cabinet ministers to do depends entire ly on the final shape in which the treaty is returueu. The dreary prospect of interminable war in South Africa and increased tax ation at home is no deterrent to Christ mas gaiety. The shops and markets are brighter than ever, gay throngs till the streets, business is at top-notch and the theaters are crowded. Thousands of people are preparing io Invade London to welcome Lord Kooerts nome. ne numuer 01 spec ators of the march to St Paul's of "Bobs," accompanied by the Prince of Tales on January 0. Is likely to break all records. The officials are already besieged for tickets for 1he thanksgiv ing service and window owners are anxiously awaiting the announcement of the line of march. The British admiralty has thorough ly wakened up to the importance of submarine and similar methods of war fare. It has arranged to test the in vention for steering torpedoes and sub marine boats by means of the wireless teleeraphy operated by A. C. Higgs, the United States consul at Weymouth. The United States naval attache. Com mander Clover, is following up the matter closely. - Germany has made an offer for the German rights. The Invention has been considerably al tered since it was first shown to the -German government. The inventor now expresses the belief that the dan gr of interference, or "jamming," as it - Is technically called, has be en eliminat 'T.v As "recent Marconi experiments prove, instruments not exactly tuned to the' same note can have no influence over others, regardless of the power of the batteries. Mr Higgs provides each topedo with a different note anel directs It from a ship or the land, on or under water, to wards the object it is ilesired to de stroy, by means of the same current whereby wireless messages are trans mitted. ' . . According to Sir Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical .society, Amorieau3 are responsible for forming a corner in Polar dogs and the pending -British and other Artie expeditions are confronted with a ditli culty nearly as great as that of the Ice felds. It appears that E. B. Bald win; the' American explorer, has lought up such a large supply of dogs tlvat their price has risen from $18 to S:0. and they sre hard to procure even .it .that price. Mr Baldwin says he has no more dogs than he needs. He fore saw the scarcity and bought parly. .

HEAVY WIND AND RAIN. Woman Instantly Killed By Being Blown From a Tank. San Francisco. Doc 15. The heavi est wind and rain storm in the history of the state raged for half an hour yesterday afternoon. One woman was killed near Salinas and the damage to property will be considerable. The telegraph and telephone companies suffered severely and for several hours service was completely suspended. The greatest damage done to the wires was between this city and Ben'cia, where The wind from San Francisco bay bael full sweep. In places the telegraph and telephone poles lor sev eral hundred yards were blown down. The few telegrams received from out side, points show that the storm ex tended quite generally over the cen tral and northern portions of the state. The Drinciual daruatre done was caused by the wind. At Salinas, Mrs ! John King was instantly killed by being blown from the tank of a wind mill. Heavy thunder and lightning accom panied the storm. In this city the wind blew at a ter rific velocity and the rain ileseended iu sheets. High fences and billboards were blown down, lamp posts were twisted, signs were thrown to the sidewalks and plate glass wondows were broken. Trees were blown across car tracks and the roofs and fronts of frail builelings were carried away. In Oakland the greatest force of the wind did not exceed a periotl of over twenty minutes but it made its pres ence felt every minute. On the Oak laud Mole twenty poles went down and telegraph connection with San Francisco was cut off until late at night. At the Judson Rolling mills a big smokestack was blown down and a. part of the works was unroofed. Four empty coal ears caught the full force of the wind and were driven off the end of the track at long wharf, into the bay. At Berkley, St Matthew's Episcopal Mission church was entirely demolish ed and many other structures were badly strained. Meagre dispatches from outside points show that the storm covered considerable territory. At Vallejo several persons were injured by ny ing debris. A large section of the roof of the Wilson house was carried off by the winel. the large coal shed of the Vallejo Gas company was de molished end the electric and tele phone systems were badly elamaged. The, storm , lasted half an hour. In Fairfield some houses were blown down. In farming and orchard elis- -rriets outbuildings and fencing were damaged and garden plants and trees were uprooted. Reports received from Rio Vista. Cordelia and Elmira are to the effect that the storm inflicted much damage. In the vicinity of Napa trees were fell On J. B. Morris's ranch at Agua Caliente, a large gum tree was pros trated by the high wind and wrecked the Morris residence. Fortunately the inmates escapeel injury. Chimneys, fencing and' outbuildings were blown down in different parts of Sonoma valley and telegraph wires north and south were prostrated. PARLIAMENT DISMISSED. The Queen's Speech Was One of the Shortest. London, Dec 13. Parliament was dismissed to-day until the middle of February, with the reading of the shortest of the queen's speeches. It was as follows: -"My Lord and Gentlemen: 1 thank you for the liberal provision you have made for the expenses incurred by th; operation of my armies in South Afri ca and China." .. The proceedings to-day in the house of commons were a repetition .In minia ture of the debates of the brief session. The ministers were heckled, the war was virulently denounced, and Mr Chamberlain was further attacked. The war funds were finally voted after the secretary of state i'or war, Mr Broderick, had given an assurance that the government, during recess, would cordially co-operate? with Gen e"al Kitchener in an endeavor to end the war. Particularly stinging were the re marks of John Bryn-Roberts. liberal. He declared that the British treatment of the women of South Africa was an outrage on civilization, and that it was blasphemy to hold Christian services in St Paul's in counee-tion with the re turn of Lord Roberts while there were such proceedings in jsouth Africa. Mr Broderick hotly denounced Mr Brya-Roberts's charges, asserting that it was criminal to make allegations which could not be proved but which, however. - would be telegraphed to South Africa to increase the eliseon tent there. He held up Mr Bryn-Rob-erts to the censure and reprobation of nearly every member of the house of commons. These remarks were greet ed with cheers. Mr Broderick ihen repealed that the government did not desire to pursue a policy which would make it more difficult for the Boers to cease fighting, and that the government abided in the declarations of Mr Cltamberlain. : The session was suspended until 2 o'clock ' in the afternoon,' when both houses' met and were prorogued.

The purchase of the Pennsylvania Coal Co In the interest of the Erie Railway is look en! upon in anthracite circles in this city as but preliminary to a still erloser alliance between the anthracite Inter ests. It Is said that, the next move of the Morgan interests will be to purchase the anthracite interests of Coxe Brothers & Co in the Hazleton field, and that several offers for the property had already been made. The tonnage of this firm, together with that of the Delaware. Susquehanna, and Schuylkill railroad, owned and controlled by it, is almost as large 'as that of the Pennsylvania Coal Co. Having secured these two interests the most dangerous indepenuent com petition in the anthracite coal would be removed. 1 An authority on coal matters says: "With the Morgan interest practical ly iu control there could be an entire re-arrangement of the present situa tion so far as the geographical dis tribution of anthracite is concerned. Instead of each anthracite carrier iu vaeling tbe territory of the others, flooding it with coal and dividing ton age rate's, each would confine it ' dis tribution within its legitimate terri tory, elite- consideration being given to its proportionate share ot the en tire territory. The Reading, for in stance, instead of shipping large iuantities of anthracite to the west, there to come in competition with other companies, would confine itself purely to the country reached by its own lines and to New England. In this manner the railroad woulel receive the entire freight tonnage receipts upon its own output of cosl."

A com mittee appointed recently by the man agers of the various athletic organiza tions of Yale university to- devise a plan by which the system of financial support of athletics may be improved, issued a public letter this morning, suggesting that instead of giving in discriminately for different athle-tic purposes, as At present, each student in the university who can att'orel to do so be assessed a small sum. probably between $3 and $10 each year.
