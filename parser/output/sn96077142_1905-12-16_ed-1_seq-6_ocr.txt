CONGRESS IN SESSION. Body Which Insures Support to the President in Carrying Out . Policies. The assembling of the Fifty-ninth congress In regular session Is an event of more than usual Interest The Lody is representative of the issues which en tered into the memorable campaign of last year, and a large proportion of the membership may be truly said to have been elected as a result of the Roosevelt tidal wave. That fact undoubtedly will go far to strengthen the support which the president will receive in his efforts to. carry into effect policies to which be is committed and that have been ap proved so overwhelmingly by the peo ple of the United States. Tbe republic an party has the largest majority It has ever had In the legislative branch of tho government, and that should be fresh assurance of wise and effective legisla tion. The responsibilities resting upon that majority are great, says the Troy Times, and there is every reason to be lieve they will be fully and satisfactorily met. The organization of tho house of rep resentatives was quickly accomplished. and was In accordance with conditions which had long been manifest: Speaker Cannon, a veteran statesman of most honorable and acceptable record, who served with distinguished ability as pre siding officer of the. house In the last congress, was reelected without the slightest opposition and with such en thusiastic and unanimous loyalty by the republicans as to make the choice a foregone conclusion long before the vote for him was actually cast Such U his popularity among all his congres sional associates that but for political considerations there is hardly a doubt that he would have been favored for tho place by many democrats as well as by those of his own party. The exigencies of the situation compelled the democrats to retain as leader on the floor the bril liant but somewhat effervescent Wil liams of Mississippi, who received the empty honor of a nomination for the speakership. The prompt manner In which congress has "got down to business" gives ground for the hope and expectation that much excellent work will be accomplished, to the benefit of the country and with the approval of the people. Some momen tous questions will come before the body, and the members, fresh from the ranks of American citizenship, should bring to the discussion well-defined com prehension of tbe public Interests and wishes. With the legislative branch in political accord with the executive, and with the administration as well as tbe leaders in congress pledged to economy and efficiency, the sum total of the acts of the present session of congress should be most gratifying and praiseworthy. 

PROSPERITY OF UNCLE SAM Never So Rich and Finances Never,, Before In Such Excellent ; Shape. ; Last year the deficit in tbe first five months of the fiscal year was about $25,000,000. It is less than $12,000,000 so far for the fiscal year beginning last July. The national expenditures aro being kept down to about the level reached last year. There Is a constant gain in government revenues, teys the Cleveland Leader.. The increase Is chiefly In tbe customs. The unprecedented prosperity of tho country is shown In heavy purchases of foreign products, both for immediate consumption and for use In manufac tures. In November the net gain In rev enue was over $2,000,000, compared with the corresponding part of 1904. Such expansion of tbe nation's In come leads some high authorities to be lieve that by the end of the fiscal year the United States treasury will reach the fortunate state of an even balance between well-guarded expenditures and growing receipts. Panama canal fl nances, of course, do not come under this general head. They will have to bs provided for by tbe sale of bonds for that express purpose. , ... Uncle Sam was never so rich, and his finances can be adjusted readily to whatever needs he may feel like recog nizing. Two per cent, bonds are rapid ly being issued In exchsnge for four per cents.. The four's redeemable In 1907 have lately sold at prices which would net the purchaser less than six-tenths of one per cent, a year to be exact, 66 cents on every $100 If he kept the bonds until they can be retired at tho will of the government and the premium extinguished.
