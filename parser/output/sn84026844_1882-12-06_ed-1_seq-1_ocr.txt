' 0nb thing at a time, gentlemen. Let us moke sure that we can offer sufficient inducements to new lilies of transportation before we bother ourselves about the route they will select to get here. Mil MacVkaoii's assurance was not needed to convince tho country that President Garfield did not promise immunity to a (iiunuerer. i/oravy ia noi iuo iirat man who has tried to trade on the dead President's alleged friendship. V k print some very interesting dispatches from Washington' this morning. Among other things we have the entertaining information that Mr. ]*ewis Baker isMa hot" candidate for Senator ' Davis' seat. It is possible that somebody has lt?<l a nightmare. It is also possible that Mr. Baker is guilty as charged.. If he is, and it should ever be his lot to preside over the United States Senate, what would honorable Senators think if it ahould occur to him to decide, from that high place, that eleven is a majority of twenty-two. Tin: question of the legality of the ordinance fixing the time for electing the Chief of the Fire Department, which was suggested in Council last night, has not much weight. The new ordinance merely specifies at which of the meetings in December the eit't'ituu huhji cskc pmcu. iuo uruwuuuv which it amended provided thut the election should take place in that month; and whether the new ordinance was legally udopted or not, an election held at a regular meeting in December would be a legal one, inasmuch as the old ordinance is still in force if the new one ia not "R. B." your communication is of interi est, and we should be glad to give it the space of, say, twenty-five lines in the Intelligencer. "We can not afford to give it a column .and a quarter. If you will be kind enough take a little more time, and condense what yon desire to say, it will Htand a" better chance of seeing daylight. The prospect of any article being read decreases in proportion to its length. Kewspaper readers rarely care for essays at aU. Those communications which deal with news mutter or strike some phase of popular thought are most in request The esteemed RegitUr yesterday treated its readers to a bewildering piece of eaterprise. It was furnished with the'President's message by the Western Associated Press, just aa the, Intkixioknceu was, and | flie service was performed promptly "and well "by the 'Western Union Telegraph j Company. But the esteemed Register was I, not satisfied with that It must needs go to the great trouble and large. expense of having that very Interesting and able document as. a. "special dispatch to the Jltgitler." "Wherefor we feel moved to Tepeat the oiler whiclnve had the honor to make In connection with the Talmage sermon of a week*ago? last Sunday. If the Jtegider will present the bill of any tele-1 graph company, showing that it furnished, the rriwidentVuiessajfe to the Jleghler.out-J side of the regular Associated Wess service, tlie Intklliqesckr will?oh, so gladly?'pay that little bill: Weesteem it a real pleasure to do good in this beautiful world. * A I'nlou m nil road. I >*ow that the general thought of atldi- j tionu'l railroad.facilities for-Wheeling has taken i.'old of the public mind many sugnf varviuc vnluo are offered. Tina ia an auspicious sigu. Out of many plane we are likely-to get the thing we need. But we must u'ot lose' sight of the main object?to secure additional railroad facilities This ia to he accomplished hy securing -rand offering to all railroads a right of way that will reach the manufacturing concerns. Mr. Wallace's resolution, offered in the joint committee yesterday, goes to the marrow of the case and embraces all that need be considered at tbis time. It embodies the main.proposition and strips the question - ot everything that might confuse, or mislead. Mr. Wallace's resolution?in short, gi yea practical point, to Dr. .Tepson's public-spirited resolution. There is somo danger of loading the gem*-1 ral question down with details with which j the city need not novr concern itself. If we fceep in view what it is we arq aiming at, and puaa ior ttiut point, uuncmues 01 ,uetail, which come more properly un<lor Ike heads o( engineering and construction,1 can be met later and in another way. j We shall fuVther facilitate tho general; solution of the problem it wo bear in mind that this movement doea not look to the accommodation ol any one railroad. Wei are paving the way now tor tho future! coming of any and ail roads. At thin mo-H ment, it looks as though six companies, | the Baltimore <fc Ohio, tho South Ponnaylvaoia, the Wheeling, Parkeraburg jk\ Charleston, the rittsuurgu, wheeling <fc Kentucky, the Wheeling & Lake Erie, aud I the Tuscarawas Valley will soon be uskiog for facilities in Wheeling. Jf tliey do not all prefer requeets. If' only one of them has something to aak; if not one of them lias any proposition to wake, still the city must do now what it should have aonrf years ago?provM? tor its own welfare. This it will do by provld-1 ink a right of way for a union railroad to be waver controlled by.thfc eitvof Wheeling. This is all wo bave.to fiitok of joow? ana! ]t in enough for the present.

A DKJHfcCKATIC ALLY ?r Blniuc'h-.V Willi nud lUouiltlalrsfy Prediction. PmuoKLriffA, December 5.?The next ital question to divide political parties in his country, says Assistant United Statea attorney Genend Ker, will be the expeliencyof annexing Mexico. In comparison nth the importance of this aubiect. he leclares that the disputes on questions of Ivil-service reform, internal revenue and he tariff laws will sink into significance. U present Mr. NKer can -see no vital [iiestion dividing the Kepublicnn and democratic parties, and it is this absence >f a bone of contention that will hasten i dispute. Uut the leading cause to bring ibout this result is the increasing commer:inl interest taken by Americans in Mexiain a flairs. The investment of American apital in Mexican railroads lias already iwakened an interest among business men n the atlairs of that country, and Mr. Ker ixpeclsto see leading commercial men rom the Northern States enimiru in nrtivn radu with the people across the border. Che resources of Mexico have only recently jcconic known to the people of this couury.' -Mr. Xer believes our financial inter!8t in that eouutry will ultimately lead to a leiuand for its annexation. The completion of a shin canal across he Isthmus of Panama will make if imjerative to the integrity of the 'American government that the United States should :ontrol all the country between the pres* rnt frontier and the canal. When that hi3' is reached there will be prospects of a liriving American trade in that part of South America lyiug along the Pacific :oast, and following this theAmerican Hag vill be as much respected on the summits if the Andes, iu the valley of the Amazon 1 md at the llorn as it is in the sight of the 1 Capitol dome. Sir. Kcr expects to see American inluencemiule paramount, not only in the outberly direction, but in the North also, is Canada will be obliged in course of. time ! 0 seek annexation lor protection. Jt jb rapossible, he says, for a weak and isolated icople like the Canadians, after separation i rom England, to thrive beside a powerful lation like the "United States, and its ab* 1 iorption as an integral part of the Governaent is, therefore, imperative. Then will America and the United States become coixtensive. 3IRN.iI.ANC4 l ltl'N N EW ADM

"Un30wn to her family she studied the art in' i loecupied moments with Miss Rose Wat1 i n, once a well known star of the variety i ige.

PiiiunEWiiu, December, 5.?Tho ironmarket remains nbout the Bame as last week, their being little change in nny direction. Tho feeling perhaps is a littlq more settled, but tho impression made (luring the recent flurry hns not entirely subsided, bo that unless supplies nre absolutely required jiarchuaes are postponed ou the 1 chances of lower figures later on. Prices on pig iron aro a triflo cosier, but there aro some branches which aiu firmly held at quotations current for several months nasL Their aro exceptions, however, auil it would bo useless to ignore the fact that the market shows svmntoms of a gradual weakening. Stocks are unusually light, so that tho decline is not because of any. immediate pressure to realize (although there are a few such cases), but ' becauso a clcaTly defined reduction at once is considered safer Hum to carry stocks on an uncertainty. It .is pot likely that stocks Will recede much if anything below, the rate quoted to-day. Deliveries on old contracts are being kopt up as usual, bo that as regards surplus stocks, buyers are not likeiy to secure any advantage by waiting beyond what could bo had to-day. Sales during the week for ^Philadelphia deliveries have been made at the following figures, according to brand:. No. I foundry from $25 to $27 50, No. 2 foundry $2-1 to $2-1 50; Gray forgo $22 to 52U. A sale of .10,000 tons of foreign Bessemer iron has been made, but tho terms are not quoted. Oilier lots are under negotiation, at $215 asked and ?22 bid. Several thousand tons of American sold at the furnace for $22. Business in manufactured iron has been very quiet daring tho past week so far as regards eales, but deliveries are being made on old coutTucts pretty well up to the full capacity of the mills. The uncertainty in regard to pricea. mid "<??? the holidays has a tendency to restrict business for the present, but there is no rensoii to anticipate any serious fulling oil' iu consumption, so that if largo orders are not given out, a continuous run of small ones may be expected in their stead. The fsoling in financial circles is too unsettled to warrant very sanguine predictions. As regards nrices, the market is not satisfactory, mill cost of production will have to be rcuuecd in order to give some margin to manufacturers.- In the meantime muck bars liavo sokf at $40 to $41 at the mill merchant bars $25 for best refined down to $2 25 for ordinary. Tho steel rail trade is in a fair condition, notwithstanding reports to the contrary. Prices arciow, it is true, but it is not at all likely that tho companies will sufler loss oven at forty dollars, and tlio tact of such largo tsaha proves conclusively that consumption in 13S3 will not fall far sliort of the year now closing. More than $400,000 worth of new business within fourteen daya'distriluited among the. three mills nearest Philadelphia is certainly not a bnd showing. At the same time, it is hardly probable that they will continue to pay for jiiuur iih wnen prices were ten to fifteen dollars per ton higher than flt present. Hence, a. moderate reduction may be insisted upon, or the works will be closed until an agreement can be arrived at. It is higlily probable, in fact, that the contracts for forty dollar rails are subject to cancellation in case of diliicultiea arising on this question. JuilUNtrial NutcN. William P. Pollock & Co., Youngstowu, have just completed two six-ton boilers for tho Ohio Iron and Steel Company, Lowellville, Ohio. .jjrt it , Kyle Co. are making charcoal at Newcastle, Oliio, ia ovens, with every satisfactory results, the yield beintr 25 per cent, more than by the old plan. Virginia will soon have the largest iron furnace in tho United States. The Victoria furnace (iu Jlockbridge) now nearly ready to be put in blast, will daily produce, it is expected, 200 tons o( iron. This furnace is owned by tho Iron and Steel Association of Virginia, composed of" English capitalists, .kiv?iuw iiiio mo iron world unheralded, having grown up silently in the Virginia mountains; but for solidity and completeness of construction, no such plant an bo found elsewhere in America. Business on the Panhandlenever was bo large, and day after day trains are left over ior lack of motive power. The majority of the engineers who ruu freight engines on the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati tfcSt. Louis lines last' month, earned ?150, and some from $100 to $165.

'The animal report of Mine Inspector Roy, of OJiio, placed the total number of oil's of coal taken out this year at 9,450,000, m excess over the yield of 1881 of 1,000,000 ons.
