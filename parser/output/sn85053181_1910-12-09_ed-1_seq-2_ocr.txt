Swanson of Virginia, who succeed thile late Senator Clay, and Lafayette Young of Iowa, who takes the seat made vacant by the death of Senatol J. P. Dolliver. Senator Cummins of Iowa will in, troduce a resolution in the senate to. morrow designed to help in the re. vision of certain schedules of the tarifl law. Tihe rule will permit the taking up of a single schedule for revision without rendering the balance of the law open for amendment. Senator Cummins also will Intro duce a resolution limiting to 60 days time a bill may be held in a senate commitrtee.
