Accept our Thanks. -, To Ui Caioa Telegraph Company we ton- iW our heartiest acknowledgments and thanks lor furnishing to as, on Tuesday, tb President's Message in full, frt of tzptms. Tb Metsage was transmitted with rapidity aad with an accuracy that was truly remark ail. Every sentence! wat complete, and every lino legible. We Teature to say that lacb an accurate copy of a Message was never rtoaiTed here before by telegraph, aa that fur- nUhed our reader! yesterday morning. We have frequently borne testimony to the A ill, energy and ability of the Cleveland offluers and Optra tors of the telegraphic Una, and this U but a new proof that all commen dation are no more than just. Rather a Good Thing. Aretha rebels natural humorists, and do they always speak in what Artemns would mil a "sareastlcal" style? The doca meats of mtny of their leaders would indicate that each was the case, as witness the message of Jeff. Daria, the reports of " Commodores" Hollies and Tatnail and the call of Sterling Prise. The latest document we hare receired from the South is a letter from Gen. Drayton, rebel commander at Hilton Head, Beaufort and Ticinity, to Got. Pickens, reporting the condition of the negroes in that neighbor- -1 hood. Erery account from Federal sources , ngarding the negroes, reports them as leT ing their masters and flocking toward the , Stars and Stripes, taking with them what- erer of Talue they could lay their bands tip on, whether it previously belonged directly to them or their masters. At Beaufort, be ' tore our troops landed, the negroes had cel ebrated the evacuation of the place by the whites, by ransacking the houses and de stroying great amounts of property. They had refused to accompany their masters into the country and persisted in getting as near ina reuerai neei an pwuuiq. rou ui ' ' rections wete, of course, rife among the plant art, and Gen. Drayton was instructed to re- - port upon the danger of such an event. He replied that not only had there been no in surrection, but he had neither beard of nor Seen any pillaging, incendiarism-or violence, i .1m ih.t tym taiar facan nr niHtnpaifmcc . - r . t J - to orders to accompany their masters into the country, were to be assigned to their fear and dismay at being left alone and nnpro- tM-tad. Tha onlv ezDlanation to be had of this statement, is that the General was him' sell so far removed from the Federal forces iter they landed, that he waa physically unable to see any of the proceedings of the ' slaves, who saw In the advent of our troops ' the dawlng of their hour of freedom and de- Hvennce. Certainly " dismay and helpless- ' aess" was not very apparent in the shouting, rejoicing crowds of contrabands which flock' ed to the camps of the Unionists. Let It not be understood that we approve of the acts of violence done at Beaufort by the negroes. We speak of it as a fact, not a merit, it was the natural exhibition of re " Iribotion upon those who had deprived them ot their liberty. The Voice of the Democrats. It would be astonishing, if it were not to ' reasonable, thit the voice of the Democratic -forth is so heartily joining in the sentiments of Col. Cochrane, as set forth in bis speech the other day to his regiment. Who, one year ago, would have dared to prophecy that to-day the men wbo expressed the strongest mancipation sentiments, would be sturdy old Democrats like Ben. Butler, Daniel 8. Dickinson, Edwin CrosweU and John Coch rane? Sach man would have been disbC' lieved by all Republicans, and hissed down by Democrats. And jet the inevitable eoure e of events has wrought the change and made Abolitionists of men who had practiced and preached pro-slavery all the years of their life until this war opentd their eyes. We have heard the question asked, why do the Republicans allow the Democrats to lead off in this matter, and why do Republi can papers quote so much Democratic author ity, rather than their own leaders ? We ao swer that the Republicans have been fighting tyt years to educate the people up to the " standard to which they are just arriving. Anti slavery has been preached for years by all the Republican leaders, and they have converted a vast number from the error of their pro-slavery ways. ' Now that the Dem ocratic leaders have come upon the same ground, we quote their words, that we may reach that class which would not listen to a Republican, but who have pinned their faith upon ;uui sucii men aa uiose we nave named. The people have been taught for years the position of the Republicans ; now let them iaa what ia xna ttnamnn m ma laanino- mimia of the Democrats. We have tried them with ... missionaries of the Republican stamp for years ; now we bring before them Democratic toSasionaries. We have been led to these re- marks by the following paragraph which we clip from the Washington Sunday Chronicle: So much for the especial friends of Mr. Breckinridge. We have now before us a let tar, written by one of the most eminent ad ' vocetes of Douglas, a gentleman who has oc cupied one of tbe highest judicial positions in the free Slates, and who broke loose from the Democratic organisation, and rejected all tbe offers of the Administration four years ' ago. Ee says : " I am a convert to the doc trir.fs of John Cochrane's speech, endorsed by General Cameron, and yon may be sure the whole North ia now ready for this, and iriU approve it." Gov Plerpelat's Message. Gov. Pierpoiut of Kanawha, or Westora Virginia, delivered to the Senate and Bouse of Representatives In Wheeling, on Kjnday last, 4 vary sound message, In spedting o! the rebellion, he says that tbe leaders cf it. la the blindness of their wrath, havs ought to throw aside the protection of the Constitution th best salegnard of the very rights they were so anxious to maintain. But the tide of the rebellion is receding, for the American people have resolved that their Government shall be maintained nd d:fend ed. In regard to Virginia, Gov. Flerpolnt calls upon the people to rally to the support of the stars and stripes, and refers to the la mentable condition of that portion of the State under control of the rebels. There, he has ascertained, all the able-bodied males be tween the ages of sixteen and sixty bare been forced luto the Confederate amy. A large portion of the slaves have been sent south for . securitv. All the livestock has been seised for the use of the rebel army; farms have been stripped of horses, wagons, fencing and timber, and the bonses of the people of blankets and clothing, and whatever would be of service to the rebels. Confeder ate Treasury Notes are already at a discount of thirty per cent at Richmond, and the most desperate measures are being taken to cause these semi-worthless papers to be taken at par value, even death and confiscation being demanded against merchants who make any distinction between them and coin. Tbe success which has attended the recon struction of the State Government has been most gratifying. Western Virginia has now ten regiments in the field and three artillery companies. Of this force three fourths are inhabitants of Virginia, and one fourth of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Besides funds enough to sustain the civil service, there was ,$80,000 in the Treasury on the 30th of September. Tbe Governor recommends confiscation of the property of all persons who may be en gaged in rebellion, and strong measures gainst those whose sympathies are with the rebels, and wbo only wait the success of the Confederates to openly express their treason, He says that during the revolutionary war those wbo refused to take tbe oath of alle giance were, among other penalties, deprived of the right of sueingforany debt, subjected to the payment of double taxes, and prohib ited from carrying on any trade or commerce whatever; while any person who should, within the State, by any word or act, defend the authority of the King or Parliament of Great Britain, was subjected to a fine of not exceeding twenty thousand pounds, and to imprisonmrnt of not mote than fire years. These measures would at this time be deemed severe, but he recommends that some'action may be taken upou the matter. The Redemption of New York. Ail honor to New York City, which at last has redeemed itself from the rule of a cor rupt, treasonable, and thoroughly villainous politician. Fernando Wood is defeated for Mayor, and George Opdyke, an able, ener getic, and very successful man, has bean elected over him. For so long bad Fernando Wood held the power of New York in his hands, that it was his boast that he could be elected Mayor when he chose. He had under h's control the entire gang roughs and bullies, who are so useful to men of his stamp in fighting an election through, if it is to be carried by no other mode. And all the gang of swindlers and political trick sters were but satelites at Wood. Every respectable business man of New York be lieved Wood to be a bad man, but for all that he has been bi-annually nominated and elected. Under his administration offices have been a matter of bargain and sale, and through contracts and favoritism, the city has been swindled out of untold amounts. Through him, Lynch, the man who, as member of Varian's Artillery, ran away from the battle field of Bull's Run, and de serted his post to the sound of the enemy' cannon, was lately elected Sheriff of New York, and, of course, Lynch did his best elect Wood. But by a remarkably close vote, Wood was defeated and Opdyke elected, for which we join onr congratulations with those of honest men of all patties. The Grand National Army. From the Report of the Secretary of War, we take the following statement of the strength of the army, both volunteer and regular:

Ports to be Opened. The Government has detercined to open the ports of the counties on the Eastern shore of Virginia to trade. These smell ports have not really been blockaded. Their trade is almost exclusively coastwise, with New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, to which cities they supply large quantities of oysters, kind ling wood, and some grain and other arti cles. Tbe Eastern shore is fairly bac's in the Union, without hardly knowing that it had ever been seceded. General Benharn is iu Wheeling. He is nnder arrest, but he himsslf does not know what for, only that it has reference to the recent pursuit of Floyd and some misunderstanding between hlrasslf' and Gen. Rosecrans. Ports to be Opened. The Secratary of War Upon the Slave Question. From the report of Secretary Cameron, we extract the following upon tbe contraband question : It has become a grave question for deter mination, what ah&ll be done with the slaves abandoned by tbeir owners on the advance of our troops luto Southern territory, as in vue Beau Tort districi ol oouin uarouna. ine whole white population is six thousand, while the number of negroes exceeds thirty two thousand. The panic which drove their masters in wild confusion from their homes, lnave them in undisputed possession of the eoiL Shall they, armed by their masters, be placed iu the field to fight against us, or shall their labor be continually employed in repro ducing the means for supporting the armies of rebellion r The war into which this trovernment has been forced by rebellious traitors, is carried on far the purpose of repossessing the prop erty violently and treacherously seized upon by the enemies ol tbe Uovernment, ana to re-establish tbe authority and laws 01 tne United States in the places where it is op posed or overthrown by armed Insurrection and rebellion. Its purpose is to recover and defend what is lustly its own. War, even between independent nation", is made to subdue the enemy, by occupying tne nosuie couuiry, auu exercimuK uuiuiuluu over all tbe men and things within Its terri tory. This being trne in respect.to Independ ent nations at war wtih each other, it follows that rebels who are laborinz by force of arms to? overthrow a government, justly bring unon themselves all the consequenoes of war, and provoke the destruction merited by the worst of crimes. That government wouia oe false to national trust, and would justly ex cite the ridicule of thecirilized world, that would abstain from the uw of any efficient means to preserve its own existence, or to overcome a rebellious and traitorous enemy, by sparing or protecting the property of tbosi who are waging war against it. Tbe principal wealth and power ot tne rebel State is a peculiar species ol property. consisting of the service or labor ot African slaves, or the descendants of Africans. This property has been variously estimated at the value ot bom $7uu,uuu,uuu to i,uuu,uuu, 000. Why should this property be exempt from the hazards and consequences of a rebellions war? It was the boast ot the leader of the re bellion, while he yet had a seat in the Senate of the United States, that the Southern States would be comparatively safe and free from tbe burdens ol war, if it should be brought on by tbe contemplated rebellion, and that boast was accompanied by the savage threat that " Northern towns and cities would be come tne victims 01 rapine ana military Bpoii," and that "Northern men should smell Southern gunpowder and feel Southern steel." No one doubts the disposition of the rebels to carry that threat into execution. Ibe wealth of Northern towns and cities, the pro duce of Northern farms, Northern workshops and manufactories, would certainly be soized, destroyed, or appropriated as military spoil No property in the .North would be spared from tbe hands of the rebels, and the rapine would be defended upon tbe laws of war, While the loyal States thus have all their property and possessions at Btake, are tne in surgent rebels to carry on warfare against the government in peace and security to their own property I Reason and justice and self preservation forbid that such should be the policy ot this Government, but demand, on tbe contrary, that, being forced by traitors and rebels the extremity of war, all the rights and pow ers ot war should be exercised to bring it a speedy clcse. Those wbo make war against the Govern ment justly forfeit all rights of property, privilege, or security, derived from the Con stitution and laws, against which they are in armed rebellion : and as the labor and service of their slaves constitute the chief property of the rebels, such property should share the common fate of war to which they have devoted tbe property of loyal citi ens. While it is plain that the slave property the South is justly subjected to all the con sequenoes ot this rebellious war, and that the Government would be untrue to its trust not employing all the rights and powers war to bring it to a speedy close, the details of the plan tor doing so, like all other mili tary measures, must, in a great degree, be left to be determined by particular exigen cies. Tbe disposition of other property belonging to the rebels that become subject to our arms 1" governed by tbe circumstances of Abe case. The Government has no power to hold slaves, none to restrain a slave of his liberty or exact his service. It has a right, however, to use the volun tary service of slaves liberated by war from rebel masters, like any other property of the rebels, in whatever mode may be most effi cient for tbe defence of the Government, the prosecution ol tbe war, and the suppression ol the rebellion. It is as clearly a right the Government to arm slaves, when it may become necessary, as It Is to use gunpowdei taken from the enemy. Whether it Is expe dient to do so Is purely a military question The right is unquestionable by tbe lavs war. The expediency must be determined by circumstances, keeping in view the great object ot overcoming the rebels, re-establishing the laws, and restoring peace to the na tion. It is vain and idle for the Government carry on this war, or hope to maintain its existence against rebellious lorre, witnont employing all the rights and powers of war. As has been said, the right to deprive the rebels of their property in slaves and slave labor, is aa clear and absolute, as the right take forage from the field, or cotton from the warehouse, or powder and arms from the magazine. To leave tbe enemy in the pos session of such property as lorage and cotton and military stores, and the means of con stantly reproducing them, would be madness. It is, therefore, equal madness to leave them in peaceful and secure possession of slave pioperty, more valuable and efficient to them for war, than forage, cotton and military stores. Such policy would be national suicide. What to do with that species of property, is a question that time and circumstances will solve, and need not be anticpated further than to repeat that tbey cannot be held by the Government as slaves. It would be useless to keep them as prison ers of war; and self-preservation, tbe highest duty ot a government or of individuals, de mands that they should be disposed of or employed in the most effective manner that will tend most speedily to suppress the In surrection and restore the authority of the Government. If it shall be found that the men who have been held by the rebels as slaves are capable of bearing arms and per forming efficiency military service, it is tbe right, and may become the duty, of the Gov ernment to aim and equip them, and employ their services against the rebels, under pro per military regulation, discipline, and com mand. But In whatever manner they may be used by the Government, it is plain that, once liberated by the rebellious acta of their mas ters they should never again be restored to bondage. By the master's treason and re bellion he forfaits all rights to the labors and service of his slave, and the slave of the rebellions masters, by his service to the Government, becomes justly entitled to free dom and protection. The disposition to be made of the slaves of retels, after the the close of the war, can be safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress. The Representatives of tbe peo ple will unquestionably secure to the loyal slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under tbe Constitution of tbe country.

Excitement at Paducah. [Correspondence of the St. Louis Democrat.] On Tuesday last secessionist in Paducah the name of Wooltolk, bung a secession nag out ol bis window as some 01 our troop were Mating by, and hurrahed lot Jeff. Davis. Tbe man had done the same thing before, on several occasions, and tbe matter was reported to Uen. Bmttn, DUt ne reiusea to interfere. This refusal of Gen. Smith caused great indignation among the troops, and doubts of bis loyalty were freely expressed lit Paducah. - ' The matter having been reported to Gen. Wallace, he sent hit aid-de-camp with A aquad of men to order tbe traitorous flag to be taken in, and if Wooltolk refused, then to take it In and erect the stars and stripes over his house. Woolfolk knowing that General Smith was senior officer, refused to obey Gen. Wallace's order, whereupon Wallace's aid forcibly took down the rebel Sag and hoisted tbe stars and stripes In us stead. In the meantime Wooltolk having appealed to Gen. Smith, the latter sent bis aid, Lieut. Price, to order Gen. Wallace to have the stars and stripes taken down from Woolfolk't house. Wallace refused to obey the order, and sent word to Smith that the flag should not be taken down while there was a live man in his brigade. Wallace's aid said that Woolfolk should sleep under a loyal nag one night anyhow. Smith's aid replied he did not consider that any great honor. Where upon Wallace 8 aid knocked down bmiin b aid. Gen. Paine sent Wallace assurances ot his co-optration. As Geo. Smith had nobody but his discom fit ted Lieutenant to enforce his order, " the old flag still waves." Gen. Smith issued a general order, saying that he was authorized to put the disobedient soldiers under arrest, but preferred to appeal to their honor and sense of discipline, and there tbe matter rests. i A gentleman of Hartford, CL, has invented a revolving rifled cannon, which has three separate barrels, made of steel and rifled, thirty inches in length and one inch bore, firmly fixed in a triangular Iron or steel frame. These are mounted on a light pair of wheels, about four feet in diameter. The whole does not weigh more than two hun dred and fifty or three hundred pounds, can be drawn anywhere and managed by two sen.

For seventeen yeArs the Lcades has re newed its weekly visits to the firesides of Its friends throughout the West in general, anl Northern Ohio in particular. Improved facilities for printing have enabled its proprie tors to reduce the price till it has become a successful competitor with tbe leading week ly papers of New York. The coming year will be the turning year of the century. Every month will be crowd ed with important events, and every week will develope some new and startling phase of the . Great SlaTeholders' Eebclllon! It Is unnecessary tor us to dilate on the importance of one's taking a newspaper at this time when oar country is passing through one of the most terrible and gigan tic civil wars the civilized world has ever seen. It is still more needless, perhaps, for us to urge the advantages of having a good HOME PAPER To keep us posted In the sews from the seats of war, where three-quarter of a mil lion of our eountrymian are arrayed in arms against each other to decide whether Free dom or Slavery shall predominate in oar land. , Every neighborhood, and almost every family has one or more of its mem bers in the army, and the movements of the divisions will be a matter of intense interest to alL We shall take the utmost pains to give particular acuounts of all engagements, And Pablish tlie Lists of Killed , and Wounded. And in fact not omit any information that san interest the very large number of readers of the Weekly Leader. Notwithstanding the war monopolizing necessarily so large a share of our columns, we intend to devote a liberal space to the details of other news of the day, and also not omit the literary and miscellaneous matter which has always made the Liadeb a pleasant companion in the family circle. ' The LtADia will unceasingly advocate the right and the duty of the Government to protect and defend itself; and to employ nn. limited means for the accomplishment of that end. ' It will, as it ever has done, wage de termined war upon whatever is opposed to the principle of civil and Religious Liberty. The Proprietors of the Leadib have made definite arrangements for tbe year 1862, by which they trust the paper will become even more of a necessity to the people of Northern Ohio than ever befei-e. Vull telegraphic re ports (for which tbey pay more than any other paper in Ohio out of Cincinnati,) wll be given.
