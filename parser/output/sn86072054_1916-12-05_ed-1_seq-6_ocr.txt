The j>> Uossage In full Is aa follows: ' Gentlemen of the Congress: ' In fttlSlllug at this time the duty t utu uyuu me ny me ronftirutton or Bjftj wtnmnnlcatlng to you from timo to am* information of tho Mute ??f the ?'

Tha Railroad Problem. In the first place, It seems to me lm perstlvely necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded tho remaining 'measures of the program of settlement hDd regulation which 1 had occasion to recommend to you at the close of your last session in rlew of tho public danders disclosed by tbe unaccommodated oimcumes xvntcn men exisreii and which still unhappily continue to ex 1st between the railroads of the mum try and their locomotive engineers, - Conductors and trainmen. I then recommended: First, Immediate provision for the . enlargement and administrative reor:. ganlzatlon of the interstate commerce . commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house Of representatives and now awaiting X action by the senate In order that the ' commission may ho enabled to deal with the many groat nnd various dn' ties now devolving upon It. with n promptness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution and Ineans of action, practically Impossible, j Second, the establishment of an eight hour day aa the legal basis alike of ' Work and of wages In ihe employment ;Ot all railway employees who are a> tually engaged In the work of opera t1 Ing trains In Interstate transportation. Third, the authorization of. the ap| polntment by the president of a small - body of men to observe the actual re i suits in experience of the adoption of | the eight hour day In railway trnnspor fr?. tatlon alike for the men and for the railroads. r* Fourth, explicit approval by I lie conmi'j gross of the consideration by the Interstate commerce commission of ho Increase of freight rates to meet stteh additional expenditures hv lite ruil roads as may have been rendered necessary by the adoption of the eight ; hour day and whleh have not been offI set by administrative readjustments J and economies, should the facts tils'0 closed Justify the Increase. .'i Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the , mediation, conciliation nnd arbitration a;--v wx guv.u tunuwiri^ii ^ i?.- i iiu [irt'.M'lIT UV > adding to it a provision llint.

Control by the Executive. And, Sixth, the lodgment In the Hands of the executive of the power, In case of military necessity, to take control of such portions nnd si: 'h roll!: Ing stock of the railways of the country as may be required for military use and to operate them for military V' purposes, with authority to draft into the military service of the VniteJ States such train crews and ndminisfyi trative officials as the circumstnuees S, require for their safe and efficient use. Jy The second and third of these recis,: ommendatlons the congress immediately acted on: It established the eight [ hour day as tho legal basis of work rf and wages in train service and It nu"...thorlxed the appointment of a eomtnisBu' alon to observe and report upon the S : practical results, deeming these the - measures most immediately needed, but 0 it postponed action upon the other sugj|. /gestious until an oppurttuiity sliould lie offered for a more deliberate consider^ y atlon of them.
