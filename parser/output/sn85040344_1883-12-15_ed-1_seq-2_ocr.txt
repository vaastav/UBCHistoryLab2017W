Superior Times. Tuos, Bardon, Proprietor. J. Lute. Christie, Editor. The Times has been duly entered at the Post Offloc in Superior. Wig., us second-class matter. STOWS. TO. SATIEBAir nBcTIS. ISS3. Oor Harbor Improvement. Maj. C. J. Allen, government en gineer, in charge of the harbors at the Lead of the lake, lias made his report to headquarters from which we take the following extract relating to our own harbor. He says: The bay of Superior, about aix miles in length by one mile wide, contains the harbors of Du luth and Superior City. The principal work -done during the summer and fall has consisted in •dredging chan nebs, with a view of obtaining six teen feet depth of water, and maintaining the piers, seawalls, protection walls, etc. One hun -dred and twenty-nine thousand cubic yard* of material 1 sand, gravel, clav and muck) were re moved from the channels. The channels worked ufion were as follows: Between the piers; from the piers through the Quebec channel, and to ward Quebec wharf, and in front of the Northern Pacific railroad dock, but distant from it 150 feet Vessels drawing 16 feet of water can enter the Larisir between the piers and reach the Northern Pacific railroad docks, although the channels have a dredge depth of sixteen feet. As In the case of the Duluth harbor, more dredging i* re quired for the harbor of Superior, especially In ■widening these channels. 5n closing, Maj. Allen recommends au appropriation of $85,000 for dredg ing, and $25,000 for piers, which ap propriation will no doubt be granted by the present congress, as it would be folly for the government to undo all it has already done, by not com peting the work so extensviely com menced. —There seems to be little or no doubt that Mr. Mitchell will be nom inated for a place in the U. S. Igind -office at Duluth by the President and confirmed by the Senate, within a few flays. This will be a personal triumph for Mr. Mitchell, but a great burlesque on the civil service law, and an insult to the people of his district. Even rant never made so unworthy an ap pointment as this would be and Arth ur must surely he destitute of all self respect, if he stoops to touch such vile iess, to say nothing about proving liimself a liar by so doing, for he has publically denounced the very thing he himself does, if he should make the nomination. In this instance we might quote the old couplet of “Birds of a feather” etc. —Detective E. H. Badgero, assist ed by Mm. \ arley on Tuesday even ing last arrested on 9th street a man by the name of Parley, an escaped jail bird from Hudson. Parley was ar rested for highway robbery committed near St. Jo, St, Croix county, in this state, last summer and was confined in the Hudson jail, from which place in company with two other prisoners, he made his escape in July last. Mr. Kadgero took his game back to Hud son Wednesday morning. This neck o' woods is not a healthy place for criminals. —Mr. Jo Retnllack left us last Tuesday, for Livingstone, Montana, near which place he has what he thinks valuable mining interests. As far as investigations have been made, the mine shows rich in both silver and copper. Mr. Retallack goes out now on a tour of personal inspection, and if things are as represented he will re turn here and arrange his business matters, and then return to Montana for permanent residence and exten sive mining operations. —The special attraction of the Times for next week will be a hand some four page supplement, printed on fine tinted paper, and devoted to holiday subjects. It will be the finest supplement ever sent out by any pa per at the head of the lake, and we have not begged donations to meet the expenses, but give it as a slight token of our appreciation of the legit imate patronage we have received during the yenr. —Puluth Times: Margaret Grey, of Marquette, has brought suit against John Busbell, of this place, for breach of promise, Margaret declaring that it will require 85,000 to patch up and repair generally, the. hole, which the inconstancy of John has stove through her heart. P. S.—Margaret has finally com promised the matter for 880. -—Congressman Strait, of Minneso ta has introduced a bill amending the pre-emption and homestead laws re lating to pine lands. All such lands are to be exempt from the workings of these laws. The pine lands arc to be appraised and sold at public sale in tracts of 40 and 80 acres or frac tional parts thereof. —The Eau Claire Lumber Cos., flouring mill, elevator, 30,000 bushels of wheat and 5,000 bushels oats was entirety destroyed by fire last Wed nesday. Loss about 865.000 with light insurance. —Senator Sabin of Minnesota, has been put at the head of the National Republican committee. We believe the Senator is not opposed to political assessments, except perhaps in a per sonal way. —A fire in St. Paul last W edneeday morning destroyed the fine Drake and Reeves blocks. Loss on buildings and contents over $250,000. About half covered by insurance. —Queen Victoria was awarded a first prize at the Smithfield cattle show, but it does not necessarily follow that hers was the best animal. —A Pioneer Press traveling report er says that Pierre is to be the future capitol of southern Dakota. \ ery likely.

Ihe reo-plioii of the message of the Presid nt is, of enura-', ihe first business to come before anew •Vugress. This document was not receive I until tlie sec ond day. so tliat liie time was consume! in cau cus d-liberalions and official htisitess. The President's message is generally eorsidered a sensible one, free from jwirtisiinship aid oilering a comprehensive resume of national itluirv. it recites our relations with foreign govenments ns being generally satisfactory. The tisheiies treaty with England has expied anl anew treaty must be made. Fran c lias repuled her laws prohibiting the importation of imcrimn pork. Germany refuses to allow tills imeriean product. condensed corn, so to sp.rak.to reach its markets, and a remedy for this diudvantage is urged. In regard to the Postal telegmpii scheme the president does not agree with the- Postmaster General, but I tlieve Hint tie gmern menl should exercise some control ovc the fele grapb corporations. Me suggests lha there is no need to reduce the national indebteiW** any further nt present, and advises the aWishWent of the excise tax, except on distilled \iqmrs He advocates the enactment of a law rep iii g the tax on national bank circulation, and per mitting tlie banks to issue notes to an arum eqnul to O l ' per rent of the inaikil value oftUir bonds. lie proposes the repeal of the act irekiug I'luh a Territory with a view to the a.v-iimplhii of authority by the government. and tl/ceontnl of the polygamy question. These are in brhf the salient points suggested by t! • m - ngc. A great many minor topics are trrabf, with sensible advice as to what had heder Ip done, but as Congress has a way of doinf about as it pleases, they are of little importaiee jtet now. No sooner was the message ilisposed o than a flood of hills were introduced in the Senile. On the Monday following, which will brthe first “bill day" in the House, a thousand mre will follow so that Congress has all it can do for inonths to (•(•me, if it attends strictly to badness which it will probably not do. For lliisis to lif a political session. It is recognized by bln par ties that legislation is to be more for tolitical effect than for any other purpose. Senator Edmunds was early in the field with a bill calculated to protect the colored nut in its constitutional rights. This will probabl bring about a long debate of a sectional ch.raeter. Senator Blairpresented a petition fora eaistitn tinnal amendment prohibiting the mnniiaelurt of distilled liquors, except for useful ptrposcf-. Senator Butler introduces a measure prvidlnj for the rejienl of all internal revenue lavs, un<t Mr. Hurd has a measure which is to reui'vv thr duty from imports of salt, wool and lumlrr. It is the expectation that any bill calculated to nf feet the tariff will be delayed until the alfcr hol iday recess, and vvill then come from th ways and means committee of the House, whih has control of this important branch of bust ups. The President, 1 am told, has delayed refer ence to two important matters until tier the holidays. He will then send in spools mes sages as to Mississippi River improvement, and the construction of the proposed Henepin Canal to connect the Mississippi and th great lakes. The difficulties in the way of making p the committees so ns to gratify the members. Mease the party at large, and secure the best isullf, are manifold. Mr. Carlisle may well fee anx ious on this score, and he will probably fx very deliberate in his conclusions. It may liesone weeks before tin's is done and then the rguiar howl of disappointment may be expected. Superior Cham’r of Commerce
