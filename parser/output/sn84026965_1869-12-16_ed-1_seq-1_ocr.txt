THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Senate and House, of ?epr&senta fives: In coraiug before you for the first time ?as Chief Magistrate of a great nation, it is with gratitude to the Giver of All Good for the many bene?ts wc enjoy. We are blessed with, peace at home, without en? tangling alliances abroad to forebode . trouble, with a territory unsurpassed in .- -'fertility and area, equal to an abundant Support of five hundred millions of peo? ple, abounding in every variety of useful ?niner?lsj in quantity sufficient to supply the'-, world lor generations, exuberant - crops, variety of climate, adapted to the ?Formation of every species of the earth's Hebe?, and suited to the habits and tastes j&ud requirements of every living thing? .^ population ot forty millions of free peo jpic speaking one language, facilities for '. every mortal to acquire education, ins tit u j lions closing to none the avenues to tame, vjr any blessing of fortune that' may be coveted, freedom of pulpit, press and school, a revenue flowing into the national lYeaaury beyond the requirements of gov? ernment. Happily* harmony is being rap idly restored within our own borders. Manufactures hitherto unknown in our Country are springing up m all sections, producing a degree of national indepen? dence unequalled by any other power. These blessings, and countless others, are entrusted to your care and mine for safe keeping, for the brief period of cur tenure of office. In a short time we must* each - of-us, retui n to the ranks cf the people who have conferred our honors, and ac? count to them for our stewardship. I earnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned by our free enlighten ?-? ed constituency, nor by our own con science* THE 

LATE WAS. Emerging from a rebellion of gigantic .magnitude, aided as it was by the syrapa thies and assistance of nations, with which we were at peace, eleven States of the Union were, four years ago, left without legal State- Governments. A national debt had been contracted; American commerce was; almost driven from the seas; the industry of one-half of the country had been taken from the control . ot the capitalists, and placed where all labor rightfulty belongs, in the keeping of the laborer. . The work of restoring the State Governments loj'al to the Union, of ..protecting and fostering free labor, provi . .ding means for paying the interest on the ^ttbifc debt, has received ample attention ,i fron?. Congress, although your effortB have not met with success iu all particulars that might have been desired, yet on the whole they have been more successful than conld have been reasonably anticipa? ted. Seven of the States which passed ,.lhe Ordinance of Secession, Ifavo been ? fully restored to their places iu the Uu iou?' GEORGIA. The eighth, Georgia held an election, at which she ratified her Constitution, Re? publican in form, and elected a Governor, Members of Congress, a State Legislature aud other officers required of them by the -Hcconstruction Acts of Congress. Subse? quently, however, in violation of the con sritution which they had just ratified, as since decided by the Supreme Court ot the State, they unseated the colored mem hers of "the Legislature, and admitted to scats some members who are disqualified by the third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, an article which they them selves had contributed to ratify. Under these circumstances, I would submit to you whether i t would not be wise, without _ delay, to enact a law authorizing the Gov? ernor of Georgia to 'convene the members originally elected to the Legislature, re? quiring each to take the oath prescribed by the Reconstruction Acts, and none to 4>e admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of the Fourteenth Amend? ment. TOE FB.SEDMEN, under the protection which they Iiave re? ceived, are making rapid progress iu learn? ing, and no complaints are heard of lack of industry on their part when they re? ceive fair remuneration for their labor. r?BLIC DEBT. The means provided for paying the in? terest on the public debt, with all other expenses of the Government, are more than ample. The loss of our commerce is the only result of the late rebellion which has not received sufficient attention from you. To this subject I call your earnest attention. 1 will not now suggest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if necessary, make it the subject of a special message during the session of Con? gress. YIEGIXIA, TEXAS AND MISSISSIPPI. At the March term, Congress, by joint resolution, authorized the Executive to order elections in the States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, to submit the new Constitutions, which each had previously framed, to the people, and to submit the Constitutions, either entire or in separate 'parts, to be voted upon at discretion of] the .Executive. Under this authority elec? tions were called. In Virginia the elec? tion took place on the 6th of July. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor elect have Dcen installad. The Legislature met and did all required by the resolution and by all the Reconstruction Acts of Con? gress, and abstained from all doubtful au? thority. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be promptly admit? ted to their seats, and that the State be -fully restored to its place in the family of States. Elections were called in Mississippi and Texas, to commence on the 30th of No? vember, two days in Mississippi, four days iu Texas. The elections have taken place, but the result is not known. It is hoped that the Acts ot the Legislature of these J States, when they tneet, will be such as to receive your approval, and thus close the I work of reconstruction. TH? CURRENCY. Among the evils growing out of the re j belli jn, and not yet referred to, is that of I an irredeemable currency. It is an evil which I hope will receive your most ear? nest attention. It is a duty, and one of the highest duties of the Government, to secure to its citizens a medium of ex? change of fixed, unvarying value. This implies a return to a specie basis, and if no Substitute for it can be devised, it should be commenced uow and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resumption, if practicable, would not be desirable. It would compel the debtor class to pay be? yond their contracts, premium on gold at the date of their purchase, and would brin g bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluc tuations, however, in the paper value, of the measure of all value of gold, is detrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the man of business an involuntary gambler; for in all Bales, when future payment is to be made, both parties spec? ulate as to what will be the value of the currency to be paid and received. I ear? nestly recommend to you, then, such leg? islation as will insure a gradual return to specie payments, and put am immediate stop to fluctuations in the value of cur? rency. The methods to secure the former of these results are as numerous as specu? lations on political economy. To secure the latter, I see but one way, and that is to authorize the Treasury to redeem its own paper at ;.. fixed price Whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold. The vast resources of i.he nation, both developed and unde? veloped, ought to make our credit the best on earth. With a less burden of taxation than the citizen has endured for six years past, the entire public debt could be paid in ten years. But it is not desira? ble that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time. Year by year the ability to pay increases in rapid ratio \ but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be without a violation of contracts. The public debt is represented in great part by bond, having from five to twenty, and from ten to forty years to run, bearing interest at the rate of six and five per cent, respectively. It is op? tional with the Government to pay these bonds at any per cent, after the expiration of the last time mentioned upon their face. The time has already expired when a great part may be taken up and is rap? idly approaching when all may be. It is believed that all which are now due may be replaced by bonds bearing a rate of in? terest not exceeding four and a half per cent., and as rapidly as the remainder be? came due. To accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize interest to be paid at either of the three or four of the money centres of Europe, or by any Assistant Treasurer of the United States, at the option of the holder of the bond. I sug gest this subject for the consideration oi ongress, and also, simultaneously with this, the propriety of redeeming our cur? rency, as before suggested, at its market value at the time when the law goes into effect, increasing the rate at which curren? cy will be bought and sold from day to day or week to week, at the same rate of Interest as the Government pays upon its bonds, subject to the tariff, and internal taxation, will necessarily receive your at? tention. REDUCTION OF TAXATION. The revenues of the country are greater than the requirements, and may, with safety, be reduced; but as the funding of the debt in 4 or a 4} per cent, loan would reduce the annual current expenses large? ly, thus after funding justifying a greater reduction ot taxation than would now be expedient, I suggest a postponement of this question until the next meeting of Congress. It may be advisable to modify taxation and the tariff in instances when Unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the present laws, but of a gene? ral revision of" laws regulating this subject I recommend a postponement for the present. I also suggest a renewal of tax? ation on incomes, but at a reduced rate, say 3 per cent., and this tax to expire in three years. With the funding of the national debt, as here suggested, I feel j safe in saying that the taxes and revenue from imports may be reduced from sixty to eighty millions per annum at once, and may be still further reduced from year to year as the resources of the country are developed. THE 

CUBAN QUESTION. As the United States is freest of all na? tions, so too, its people sympathize with all people straggling for liberty and self government. But while so sym; arizing, it is due to our honor that we should ab? stain from enforcing our views upon un? willing nations, and from taking an inter? ested part without invitation in quarrels between different nations, or between gov? ernments and their subjects. Our course should always bo in conformity with strict justice, and law international and local. Such has been the policy of the Adminis? tration in dealing with this question. For more than a year, a valuable province of Spain and a near neighbor of ours, in whom all our people cannot but feel a deep interest, has been struggling for in? dependence and freedom. The people and Government of the United States en? tertain the same warm feelings and sym? pathies for the people of Cuba in their pending struggle, that thev manifested throughout the previous struggles be? tween Spain and her former colonies in behalf of the latter, but the con test has at no time assumed conditions which amount to war in the 6ense of interna-1 j tional law or which would show the exis? tence of a de facto political organization of insurgents sufficient to justify recogni? tion of belligerency. The principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge when to accord the rights of belligerency eithor to a people strug? gling to freo themselves from a Govern? ment they believe to bo oppressive, or to independent nations at war with each other. Tho United States has no dispo? sition to interfere with the existing rela? tions of Spain to her colonial possession on this continent. They believe that in due time Spain and other European pow? ers will find tbeir interest in terminating thoso relations and establishing their pres? ent dependencies as independent powers. These dependencies aro no longer regar? ded as subject to transfer from one Euro? pean power to anothor. When the pres? ent relation of the colonies ceases they are to become independent powers exer? cising the right of choice and of self-con? trol in the determination of their future condition and relations with other pow? ers. The United States, in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and in the in? terest of the neighboring people propos? ed their good offices to bring the existing contest to a termination. The offer not being accepted by Spain on the basia which we believe could be received by Cuba, was withdrawn. It is to be hoped that; the good offices of the United States may yet prove advantageous for the settlement of this unhappy strife. Mean? while a number of illegal expeditions against Cuba havo been broken up. It ' has been the endeavor of tho Administra? tion to execoto the neutrality laws, no matter how unpleasant the task, made so by tho sufferings we have endured from lack of like good faith towards us by other nations. On the 26th of March last the United States schooner Lizzio Major was arres? ted on the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two passengers taken and carried prisoners to Cuba. Representations of these facts were made to tho Spanish Government as soon as official informa? tion reached Washington. The two pas? sengers were set at liborty, and tho Span? ish authorities in Cuba would not sanct? ion any act that could violate tho rights or treat with disrospect the sovereignty of this nation. The question of the seiz? ure of tho brig Mary Lowell, at Bahama, by the Spanish authorities, is now tho subject of correspondence between this Government, Spain and Great Britain. The Captain-General of Cuba, about May last, issued a proclamation authoriz? ing the search of vessels on the high seaR. Immediately remonstrance was made against this, whereupon tho Captain-Gen? eral issued a now proclamation, limiting tho search to vessels of tho United States authorized under tho troaty of 1795. This proclamation, however, was immediately withdrawn. DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. On my assuming the responsible duties of Chief Magistrate of tho United States, it was with the conviction that tbreo things wero essential to its peace, pros? perity and fullest development; first among these is a strict integrity in fulfil ing all our obligations; second, to secure protection to the person and property of the citizen of the United States, in each and every portion of our Common coun? try wherever ho may choose to hlovo without reference to original nationality, religion, color, or politics, demanding of him only obedience to the laws, and prop? er respect for the rights of others; third, union o 'all the States, with equal rights in? destructible by any constitutional means. To secure the first of these, Congress has taken two essential steps; first, in declar? ing by joint resolution, that the public debt shall bo paid, principal :.nd interest, in coin; and second, by providing tho means : or paying. Providing the means, however, could not securo the object de? sired without a proper administration of tho law, for the collection of revenues and an economical disbursement of them. To this subject the Administration has most earnestly addressed itself with results, I hope, satisfactory to the country, There has been no hesitation in changing offi? cials in order to secure an efficient execu? tion of the laws; sometimes too, wberoin a mere party view, undesirable political results were likely to follow; nor any hesitation in sustaining efficient officials against remonstrances, wholly political. TENUKE-OF-OFFICE LAW. It may be well to mention here the em? barrassment possible to arise from leaving on the statute books the so-called Tenure of Office Acts, and to earnestly recom? mend their total repeal. It could not have been the Intention of the f ramers of the Constitution, when providing that ap? pointments made by tho President should receive tho consent of the Senate, that the latter should havo power to retain in office porsons placed there by federal ap? pointment against tbo will of the Presi? dent. The law is inconsistent with a , faithful and efficient administration of the ! Government. What faith can an Execu | five put in an official forced npon him, j and those, too whom he has suspended f or reason ? How'will such officials be likely to serve an admistration which they know does not trust them ? For the second requisite to our growth prosperity, time and a firm but humane administration of existing laws, amended from time to time as they may be ineffective or prove harsh and u nneeessray, are probably all that are required. The third cannot be attained by special legislation, but must bo rogar ded as fixed by the Constitution itself, and gradually acquiesced in by tbo force of public opinion. THE Fp 

EEDMEN?CENSUS. I would respeetfully call your attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of supervising the education of freed men with the other duties devolving upon tho Commissioner of Education. If it is the desire of Congross to make tho census, which must be taken during the year 1870, more complete and perfect than heretofore, I would suggest early action upon any plan that may be agreed upon, as Congress at the lust session appointed a Committee to take into consideration such measures as might bo deemed proper in reference to tho census, and report a plan. I desist from saying more. AGRICULTURE. I recommend to your favorable consid? eration the claims of the Agricultural Bureau for liberal appropriations. In a country so diversified in climate and soil, as ours, and with a population so largely dependent upon agriculture, tho benefits that.can be conferred by proporly foster? ing this Bureau are incalculable. SUPREME COURT. I desire respectfully to call the atten? tion of Congress to the inadequate sala? ries of a number of the most important officers of tho Government. In this mes? sage I will not enumerate them, but will specify only the Justices of the Supreme Court. No change has been made in tboir salaries for fifteen years. Within that time the labors of the Court have largely increased, and tho expenses of living have at least doubled during the same time. Congress has twice found it necessary to increase largely the compensation of its own members, and the duty it owes to another department of the Government deserve? and will undoubtedly receive due consideration. CONCLUSION. There arc many subjects not alluded to in this message which might with proprie? ty be introduced, but I abstain, believing that your patriotism and statesmanship will suggest the topics and the legislation most conducive to the interests of the whole people. On mv part, I promise a rigid adherence to tho laws and their strict enforcement. U. S. GRANT. Horace Greeley writes a Letter to Ben. Sutler. The philosopher of the New York Tri? bune has written a remarkable letter to Beast Butler, which is herewith append? ed. It will be seen that the main point urged by Greeley is that the Radicals shall bribe the people of the South and their friends at the North by the offer to remove the disabilities imposed by the 3d section of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, in order to induce them to ratify the proposed Fifteenth Amend? ment, and which Greeley more than indi? cates will fail unless the proposition which he makes be acted upon by his party : ToMaj. Gen. B. F. Butler, M. C.: My Dear Sir : Your nsnigj I think you will have remarked, is very often pro? nounced) from one end of our country to the other. I, traveling somewhat, ob? serving a little, and reading newspapers considerably?quite often hear it mention? ed, and (it may surprise you to learn) not always admiringly. And yet, while I have for many years heard and read all manner of evil said of you?some of it absurdly groundless and false?I cannot recollect that I ever heard or read a suggestion that you were a fool. Now, I come before the Eublic to impeach, not yourself personally, ut a policy wherewith your name is pop? ularly and prominently identified, as lack? ing rational motive and at war with com? mon sense. 1 allude te that policy which prolongs indefinitely the proscription and disfranchisemen t of a large portion of the men of the South for their part in the late rebellion. Understand that I speak from the stand? point not of sentiment, but of business. I do not here impeach that policy as harsh or hateful, but fls deficient iu tact?in gumption. 1 impeach it as nursing and intensifying enmities certain to subvert, at no distant day, the party which is identi? fied with it. I will not dwell upon the well-known fact that the late Governor Andrew, in his farewell message of address, put forth fouf years ago, strongly urged a policy antagonistic to this?a policy that con? templated the early and complete concili? ation of the South, through the enfran? chisement and magnanimous treatment of her natural leaders. Nor need I invite your attention to the fact that General Sickles (a shrewd, thoroughly practical politician,) officially remonstrated, more than three years ago, against the proscrip? tion of prominent and wealthy ex-rebels, as depriving him of the services of the very men he urgently needed and could make most useful in governing South Car? olina. Nor do I care to press home the fact, of whieh you cannot be ignorant, that tbe Southern men of education and property are by far more reasonable and less bitter tban their poorer, more igno? rant neighbors?are less implacable, more rational, and more ready to unite heartily in rebuilding the waste places of the land. Nor will I dwell upon the noble addition made, on motion ol General Carl Schurz, to the latest National platform of the Re Kblican party?that plank which declares oscription a temporary expedient, ren? dered necessary by a grave public peril, and to be abandoned when that peril shall have vanished. I rest on the naked fact that the Republican party imminently needs the good will which this policy re Is, and must go ander if that good will not secured. I assume that you realize the absolute necessity of the triumph of the XVth Amendment to the success of Gen. Grant's Administration, and that you must beJ aware that the fate ot that Amendment is yet doubtful. Ten adverse States suffice to defeat it; and seven?(New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennes? see, California and Oregon)?are already beyond hope. The loss of Tennessee was at once a calamity and a blunder?one of those intense stupidities which a great party is seldom flowed to repeat. How Rhode Island, Indiana, Georgia and Ne? braska stand, I need not inform you. Suffice it that it will require the wisest counsels and the best efforts to avert the threatened failure of that great and wise measure of safety, benignity and peace. The men now coming to Congress to de? mand that Tennessee be upset, and Vir? ginia remanded, and Mississippi and Tex? as held as satrapies for an indefinite peri? od, unless they vote as they are bidden, utterly fail to comprehend the situation. They evidently suppose that we have not h iug at stake?that we may keep three or four States unreconstructed and unrepre fiented in Congress during pleasure. I hope you know better?at all events, 2 do. We do not merely ueed theXVth Amend? ment ratified before 1872?we urgently need it now. If it be delayed one year longer, we shall have more than one State Legislature beside that of New York as? suming to withdraw the ratification al? ready accorded; aud, while you and I mav rightly deny the legal validity of such withdrawal, I am sure neither of us will dispute its moral weight. Connecticut is to hold an election next April, when the votes of her colored citizens will be found exceedingly useful if not absolutely need? ed ; New Jersey and Pennsylvania have U. S. Senators depending on the result of their next State election respectively, and the like votes are absolutely needed in the former, and probably so in the latter. Several seats in the next Congress from Ohio and other States will be won or lost as the right to vote for members shall be exercised by tbeir whole people or only by the whites. Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware, will each be stoutly aud hope? fully contested next year if the Amend? ment be meantime ratified, while we shall not elect one member from all three of these States if it be not. To my appre? hension, the control of the next House ot Representatives will probably hinge on that event. I ask you, then, to consider, as a practi? cal man, whether we can afford to pick and choose from among those disposed to favor that Amendment?whether it will not be suicidal folly to repel any proffered or possible support. I ask you whether any attempt to pry into the motives of those who may favor it?to ascertain whether they were not rebels, and, if so, whether they have repented of having been such?is not a Childish exhlbitloh of that spirit which "goeth before a fall." In short, I ask you to consider this whole matter in the light of naked, hearty, homely common sense, and act upon it as the demands of the exigency shall seem to require. T?he urgency of the case must excuse the freedom of this appeal. Rightly or wrong? ly, the country regards you as the leader in Congress of those who have been most exacting in their requirements of the de? feated rebels, and least inclined to t treat them with confidence or generosity. The reproaches which / have incurred in this quarter Will never attach to you, and your adhesion to the policy which the occasion demands will never be attributed to weak ness or sentimentality. I ask you, there? fore, to place yourself promptly and heart? ily at the head ot a movement looking to the instant and complete removal of all political disabilities whatever from any and every one who favors or shall favor the XVth Amendment, and their prompt res? toration to all the privileges of citizenship. "Let us have peace 1" Yours, Horace Greeley. New York, Nov. 20th, 1860, Death of Distinguished Men.?Hon. Robert J. Walker died at Washington on tho l2th inst. He was a man of great ability, especially in financial questions. ite was a most prominent advocate of Texas annexation; tho subtreasury sys? tem; was Secretary of the Treasury du? ring Polk's administration, and always a conservative Union man. Ho was a writer of great originality and power. Amos Kendal died at W&shington on tho 13th inst. Ho was a man of lino in? tellect and an old Jackson democrat; once distinguished as an Editor, and in time of Gen. Jackson's administration he was Postmastor General, and was very able in that office. Ho has long led a re? tired life in the city of Washington, and had devoted himself to more quiet pursuit than politics for many years past. He was quite a religious man in the latter years ol his lifo, devoted to the interest of Sunday schools, and a liberal giver to charitable objects. It is said that bo gave some years ago one hundred thousand dollars for building a Babtist Church edi? fice, in the city. Mr. Kondal was eighty years old at bis death. Major-Goneral Wool, of the old United States Army, diod on the Ilth of Novem? ber, at an advanced age. -? ? Josh Billings, in an article on straw? berries, says: "Cherrys iz good, but tfrey are too much like sucking a marble with a handle tow it.

Watermelons will suit enny body who iz satisfied with hall-sweetened drink; but tho man who ken eat straw? berrys. besprinkled with crushed sugar and bc8patted with lcroam(at somebody's else's expense,) and not lay his hand on his stummuk, and thank tho author of strawberrys and stummuk, and the phel low who pays for the strawberrys, is a man whose mouth tastes like a hole in the ground, and don't care what goes down 'ft w I The Township Question. Mr. Frank Arnim, Chairman of the Conference of County Commissioners,has presented a memorial to the Legislature, Urging the postponement for ten years, of the organization of the townships. It is to be hoped, says the Columbia Phoenix, that the suggestion will be heeded. Inas* much as this recommendation carries fi'olU the County Commissioners themselves, and many of them members of the party ?in power, the inapplicability of the town? ship system to the present condition of the State must indeed stand out in bold relief. The fact of the matter is, the adoption of the bill by the Legislature was an instance of legislative folly. It was a Northern system, totally unsuited to this State, and entailing heavy and entirely unnecessary burdens upon the tai payers; Let Mn Arnim's memorial be entertained. The system is a nuisance and an outrage upon sensible legislation. The memorial says: "The County Commissioners of the sev? eral counties have had their attention call? ed by the citizens to the provisions of the Act, and have been invited to confer about the objections that have been urged t<iit. The opinion entertained is, that the im? poverished condition of the State, at the present time, renders it. impossible for the people to pay the additional taxes Which the requirement under this Act provide for, aud in view of this opinion it.was deemed worthy of the attention and con? sideration of the Conference of County Commissioners of the State, in the proper discharge of their duties, to the people of the several counties, to represent to the Legislature the necessity of postponing the organizations of townships for a period of ten years at least, at. the expiration of which it is to be hoped that the State will be m a prosperous eon ditto hi ??The counties of the State, laid out as the law directs,'would be sub divided into townships of not less than thirty-six and not more than a hundred square miles in extent The State contains 37,000 square miles. Let us suppose we divide the State into townships of fifty square miles each, it would Contain 740 townships, which will require, according to the Act, seven officers in each township. The law allows $1.60 per diem for each officer. Say, for argu? ment, that these officers are on duty 150 days, at $1.50 per day; per annum it would amount to $1,575. If one township amounts to 81,575, 740 townships would amount, per atinUm, to 8l,i??,500. We have no doubt but most of these officers Would be on duty for the greater part 'of the year. You will perceive by these fig? ures the enormous expense this township bill will incur. This is only paying the salaries of officers, whose pay will be the small sum of $1.50 per day, for which no competent man, if be honestly discharges his duty, would be willing to give his pep vices.'' The Killing of ToLfifc?T.-=The fei' lowing is the Radical version of the man? ner in Which Tolbert met his death i About half-past seven o'clock on the night of December 2d, Hollingshed, Brown, Freese and White Manuel, star? ted for the capture of Tolbcrt. They had reccivod information that there was tobe a wedding at widow Hinton's residence, about three miles from Greenwood, near Abbeville, and while on their way learned that Tolbcrt was therei After securing their horses in a neighboring thicket of pines, they started tor the house; When near the house Brown, Freese and Manuel stopped, while Hollingshed slyly crept up and looked in the window at the end of tho house. He saw Tolbcrt sitting by tho fireplace, conversing with a large party of his friends. Presently some one came out of the door, when ho cropt under the house remaining there some ton minutes, While there ho heard Tolbert relate to his friends how he escaped from the Peni? tentiary. As soon Us me person who came out of the door returned into the house, be came out of his hiding place and went to his comrades and told them Tclbert was there* lie asked whaLUiey should do, as there were some forty men and women there. They all agreed to take Tolbert or die there. They .then pulled off their coats, and, drawing their revolvers, started for tho door. With one bound thoy alighted In the middle of the floor, Hollingshed foremost, saj'ing, "Bill Tolbert, you are my prisoner; surrender, or I'll kill you." T?lbert ran through the house to a door at the foot of the stairs among the worn en, tho house being full. Hollingshed followed, and while grap? pling with Tolbcrt, received from hiirilrfs first shot, which struck him in the side, making a slight flesh wound, and passfnjf out of the door opposite. They still struggled with each other, when Tolbert fired a second time, the shot piercing the ceiling overhead. Brown at (hut moment rushed in the room und fired. Tolbert then fiicd his last shot, the ball pas? sing through Hollingsbed'e leg. Manuel and Freese now entered, and shots wore tied in quick succession by Manuel and Brown, Tolbert in the meantime throw? ing up his arms and exclaiming, "I sur? render!" He then expired. ?. ?
