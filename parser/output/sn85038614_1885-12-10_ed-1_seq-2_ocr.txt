Judge Hughes'* Latost Decision. Pay before yesterday Judge Hi i.ups teudered a decision in the case of The Norfolk Trust Company vs. Morton Mar\,e, Auditor, Vc Thus decision is tbe ?"i-i that has ever been rendered in any court io a Virginia coupon case j but as tbe opinion shows that if the Auditor bad proceeded under the lsw of 1--2 iD.stea.' of relying upou later legislation the decision would probably have been in favor of tbe state, aud inasmuch as the Supreme Court of tbe Tinted States has before it a large number of coupon cases, we do not deem it necessary to publish the opin? ion, nor to censure the judge for thc decision. Nevertheless, think of a Ked aral judge issuing such a decree as the following: ppchi.i-:. In tbe Circuit Court of th*. I uitcd Mates, for the Eastern Distri.-t of Vir? ginia?

Mr. Sta ri.es will have in thc above lccrcc good grounds for asking the Ba* renie Court of thc I'nited States to re? fect thc eleventh amendment. lt Iwarfs the State into utter insignifi? cance. Surely State sovereignly liv tecoma a burlesque when the lowest faders] court can (oreo a Stats to accept oupons for taxes, compel her to pay Oats, and make her lile a receipt in hat court for money which she hui icier received. In fact, in tho ea I be bro so thc Court ordered and decreed hat the plaintiff and paid its taxes; vim h is SS if tbe Court should order nd decres that twice three is live, or hat the mOOU isSaado of green cheese. ,r that the plaintiff bad done any other i, t whit h it bad not done.

Nevertheless, we are bound to admit hat we are not certain that it will re? en e the sanction of the Legislature. ?\'e are not even thoroughly satisfied tis it it* practicability in thc counties, We in not attached to any parti, ular -theme. We are willing to support iny legislation that promises to relieve ihe State of -? the cutworms ot the treasury." la this connection we call attention toa suggestion made by Judge Hi bubs a few days age?not in his character of judge, bul a* a lawyer and citizen. He still holds that his decision in the suit ot Marni ts. Parsons, diamiBBed by the SU] reine Court ol the United States as one that ought never to have been 1,iought, was right ; and in arguing the point lie incidentally, ami unintention? ally wc may assume, suggests legisla tiOBWbkh may assist Virginia in he) ef? forts to trie herself from the entan.-le ii.ebts in whuh she linds herself aa a consequence of having issued tax it, tivahle coupons. Judge Hit-in* sa v I : '? The State's contract that these shall l>c tax-receirable is with the bond? holder, ami is not with the tax-payer before he purchases coupons, lt sub? sists as long as the bondholder hold*, and ce BB OB with him when he sells, his coupons. The unqualified doctrine that his right while holding is a mere right ta tin ai which the courts arc not bound to protect, can bs used hy the State to utterly defeat his right to sell. The State has no contract willi thc tax-payer before his pur ehasa Sf coupons. I egislation forbid diig such taxpayer from purchasing coupons for the purpose of paying taxes would violate no contract with him. It would violate only the State's contract wilh the coupon-holder, whose right is j now pronounced to bc one IS fleet, j which the courts are informed hy the ' decision in the Parsons case they are j powerless to protect ; and which, ol j course, if the courts are prohibited from pr st set! a?, the Legislature is not bound to regard. " legislation to this effect, while in tlii ting no wrong at all upon thc tax? payer who has not purchased coupons, would millet it only upon the holder ol coupons who is not a tax-payer, and an to whom the wrong is now pronounced to he dauiniitit absunc iinuria." What it ftigninos An esteemed Republican contem? porary informs the public that the naming of LOOAB and Siiuhmax for President pro tem. of the .Senate was a j bloody .shirt victory, Moth Lu,. a n and j SiiLiiMAN, it declares, indulged in "bugle blasts" os the southern que*, j lion last summer, and "now the j Republicans in the .Senate endorse and stand by them." As a sub* | stitute for the vituperation aud thc malignant utterances of Li kian and Shkkman, "bugle blast*," is good, and peihapa our contemporary is right in claiming that the Republicans in the Seuete hove endorsed these worthies. Vet we think the Booton Herald c\. poitBH \erj neatly the hypocrisy of both 

LOOA* and Sn kum an and the other Republican senators when it says : ** ll thia were intended to be the meaning ot th* votes in the Republican caucuses, all the parties concerned took very good care not to mention it. In neither the nominations nor responses was there a word about thc poor negro or thc ? second rebellion ' at the .South, which occasioned so much noise and froth in thc late campaigns. Nor ib there any likelihood that the subject will bc "referred to again until it is necessity to lire thc bucolic Republi? can heart in Ohio?tho experiment will hardly bc tried again in Sew York.

The better portion of the colored people of this city have for a tong time been dissatisfied with the mtinngcment of the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, near this city?an institution deskmed by thc Legislature for the higher education of those of both se\es of the colored race who desire to tit theinsflvts for teachers, ami therefore worthy thc confidence and patronage of thc colored people of thc State. Hut under thc appointments made for thc government ol thc institution it m cnud to have boen managed more in the interests ot politics than education, and scandal has been brought upon the college. The secretary o! the Hoard of Visitors was openly charged with irregularities Ly the treasurer. Pro? fessor Moruin. an educated colored man, was lirst reduced from thc position of principal of the college to tint of teach? er, and then unceremoniously removed altogether. This last action of the authorities has created much eon* imnt and dissatisfaction anion.* thc colored people, as well as among the students. At a meeting of the Btadoota held yesterday a memorial to the 1-egi-lature was adopted and signed, which practically arraigns the iiiniingciiiiiit of the institution. This ineinorial, after recognizing the libetal iiy of the Legislature in thc Oftablisb mint and rapport of a school for the bcnelit of the colored DOOplo, and the appointment of men Identified with Ibeir race for its management, sots forth that " it objects have to a considerable extent frus? trated bj the fad that thc school has most unfortunately fallen int.. the banda oi unscrupulous politi? cians, with a few exceptions, who use thc institution for personal advantage aa opposed to its beat interests." In evidence of tbe removal of Pr,, Storum, as principal of th.-institution. without assigning any just cause, but f.,r partisan purposes, is cited ; also his absolute dismission as one of the faculty.

Without conscious effort, ap patently, and certainly without visible straining after, itherthe lofty or the pro? found, the President has impressed ooh - me-sago the stamp of a broad and sin* ? re patriotism. tts comments and sug* ns are many, its principle4! fi ir and tbe highest. To defend the na' dignity and honor, to respect the laws him-elf .nd insist that others shall obey them, to punish and prevent dishonest acts, to advance our vast material in? 's and maintain our national credit, and to put wisdom above partisanship? these are the principles and pur; which guided the Executive hand in preparing this review of the affairs of the nation. It is thecomploi senti? ment ot patriotism reduced to practical expression and applied to the business of ihe State. A NOT!! EH Bl Kl '.'.ll TO < ill ll. 181'. Kew Yoi fe Tribune, Badlcol Repub The first message of tho President ia a creditable paper. On some of th' most important questions of which it treats it dosenrea hearty praise. Nor ia it to hun discreditable, but much 11 his credit, that it ii best and most worthy of commendation just where his party is worst and its intluence is most lo be feared. No party spirit is appro? priate in judging of the recommenda? tions which the President has to oller. Ile has been intrusted with a '.Teat rc tpooaibilitj. For the President and his party the era of criticism and of promise is over ; both are now lo be I by their performance, their capa? city in practical administration. Hence it is appropriate to oboorre that trie message, while deserving of hi^h commendation in many respects, jj likely in its best feature- to BOOt the determined opposition ot the party in power. The President's u ? -aoegO is most ri,rht j'ist where his party is most wrong, and his best ad? vice is just that which is least likely to he followed. Hm i.'.i ?ii. <? lu a Hall.
