' Ftlltne Citizen of the Situate ami Jloutt of Jleprtetentatirc: ; I congratulate yoc . on tho continued and increasing prosperity of our country. Ii" the Javor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during the past year with health, with abundant harvests. with profitable employment lor ill our , people, &iwl with contentment at borne and with peace and friendship with other nation. The occurrence, of the twenty lotirtu eh.-ction of chief mag. 1st rate hn afforded another opportunity to the pei'ple of the Lniutl btates to ex hibit to th world a significant example of the peaceful and bate transmission of the power and authority ot tut govern. meat from the public servants, whose terms office are about to expire to new. ly chosen successors. . This example cannot possibly fail o impress the profoundly tuoutftiul peo ple of other countries with the advauta- ges which Itepublican institutions at. lord, The immediate, general and cheer. ful acquiescence of all (rood citizens in the result of the election, gives gratify ing assurance to onrcoantry, and to it its friends throughout the world, that a gov ernment based on the tree consent ot an inleliignent and patriotic people, pos sesses elements of strength, stability and permanency not lound in any other lorm ot government. CIVIL EIOBT8. The continued opposition to the full , and free enjoyment of the rights of citi zenith ip conferred upon the colorud peo ple by tne recent amendments to the con stitution still prevails in several of the late slave-holding states. It has per haps not been manifested in the recent election to any large extent in acts of violence or intimidation. It has, how ever, by fraudulent practice in connec tion wun the ballots and with the regu lations as to the places and manner of voting, and with the counting, returning and canvassing the votes cast, been suc cessful in detesting the exercise or the right preservative of all rights, and the right of suffrage, which the constitution expressively confers upon our enfran chised citizens. It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics suoulu disappear. I hey prefer that no section of tho country should be united in solid apposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the equal rights amendments to the constitution is all that now stands in the way of complete ob literation or sectional lines In our politi cal contests. As lone as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or dis regarded, it is safe to assume that the people who placed them in the constitu tion as embodying the legitimate results oi iue war lor lue inlon, ana who be live them to be wise and necessary, will continue to act together anil to insist that they shall be obeyed. The president discusses this subject at still further length, and urgos congress to investigate the matter and closes un der this head with tlie following. Firm ly convinced that the subject of v. POPULAR EDUCATION deserves the earnest attention of the peo ple of the whole country, and with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the government of the United States, I respectfully recommend that congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safe guards, supplement the local educa tional funds in the several states where grave duties and responsibilities of citi zenship has been devolved on unedu cated people, by devoting to the pur pose grants of public land, and if neces sary by appropriations from the treasury of the United States. Whatever the government can possibly do to promote free education ought to he done. Wher ever education is found, peace, virtue and social order prevail, and civil and re ligious liberty are secure. nvn, service. The president devotes considerable space to this subject. Thinks some re forms have been made during his term. The reasons are imperative for fixed rules for the regulation of appointments. The danger of the old system threatens the permanency of the government it self; urges competitive examinations. In the city of New York, over 2,000 persons in the civil service have Iwr-n subject in their appointment and tenure! ot place to the operation or published rules to this purpose during the past two years. The results of these practical rules have been very satisfactory, and have confirmed tuy opinion in favor of this system of selection The oxaminations in the custom houses and postoflices have been held under many embarrassments and without pro vision for compensation for the extra la nor performed by the officers who have . conducted them, and whose commend able interest in the improvement cf the public service has induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary re ward. A continuance of these la bors gratuitously ought not to be ex pected, and without an appropriation hy congress for compensation, it is not practicable to extending the system of examinations generally throughout the civil service. It is also highly important that all such examina tion should bo conducteed upon a plat lorm system, and under the general su pervision of section 1,753 of the revised statutes, which authorizes the president to prescribe the regulations for admis sion to the civil service of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to the fitness of each candidate, in respet of age, health, character, knowlcdgo and ability, for the branch of the service into which he seeks to enter. But tho law is practi oally inoperative, for want of the re quisite appropriation. I therefore re commend an appropriation of $35,000 per annum to meet the expensus of a commission to be appointed by the pres ident in accordance' with the terms of this section, whose duly it shall be to devise a just, uniform and efficient sys tem ot competitive examinations, and to supervise the application of the same, throughout the en tire civil service of the government THE 

MORMONS. It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people of the United States to suppress polygamy where it now exists In our territories and to prevent its ex tension. Faithful and zealous efforts have been made by the United States authorities in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer the action t is delayed the more difficult t will be to there be any evil way in that is keeping back the our own soul, let's ask accomplish what is r'esired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization, which upholds polygamy, has the whole power of making ana executing ine lo cal legislation of the territory. Uy its control of the' grand and petit jurors it possesses a large influence over the ad ministration of justice.. Exercising, as the beads of this sect - do, the local political power of the terri tory, they - are able to make eflec- tive their hostility ta the law of congress on the &ubj"ct of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law depends on thoae who prac tice and uphold the evil. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of congress to enact suitable laws to protect t be terri tories is ample. It is not a case for half way measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is increasing. ' It con trols a'lvr one of our wealthiest und most populous territories. It is extend ing steadily into other territories. Wherever ft goes, it establishes poly gamy and sectarian political - power. The sanctity of marriage and the family relations are 'the corner stone of our American society and civilization. Re ligious liberty and the separation of the church and state, are among the elemen tary ideas of free institutions. To re es tablish the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormon ism have imper illed, and to fully re-open to intelligent and virtuous immigration of all creeds, that part of our domain which has been in a great degree closed to general im migration by immoral institutions, it is recommended that the government of the territory or L tab be reorganized. X recommend" that congress provide for the government of Utah by a governor and judges, or commissioners, appointed by the president and con firmed by the sen ate a government analogous to th3 pro visional government established tor the territory northwest of the Ohio by the ordinance of 1787. If. however, deem ed best to continue the existing form of local government, I recommend that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in the territory of Utah be confined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed that within a few ytars the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that this territo ry will, in good tone, become one of the most prosperous and Attractive of the new states of the union. FOREIGN RKI.ATIOXH. These continue peaceable with all na tions, and there is nothing particularly noteworthy under this head. Wc clip a few paragraphs. My anticipation of an early reply from tho British government to the de mand oi indemnity to our fishermen for the injuries suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay. in January. 1878. which I expressed in my last annual message, was disappointed, ihis answer was re ceived only in the latter part of April, in the present year, und when received exhibited a failure of accord between the two governments as to the measure of the fishing privilege secured to our fish ermen by the treaty orWashington, of so serious a cnaracter that l made? it the subject of a communication to congress, in which I recommended the adoption of the measures which seemed to me proper, to be taken by this government in maintainence of "the ri slits of our fishermen under tho treaty, and towards securing an indemc'ty for the injury their interests had suiti.ed. I sincerely hope that the basis may be found for the adjustment of the very ser ious divergence of views in the internre. tation of the fishery clauses of the treat v of Washington, which, as the correspon dence between the two governments stood at the close of the List session of congress, seemed to be irreconcileable. The state of peace and trannuihtv now enjoyed by all the nations of the conti nent of Europe has its favorable influ ence upon our diplomatic and commer cial relations with tbem. We have con cluded and ratified a convention with the French Republic for the stttlement of the claims of the citizens of either country against tho other. Under this convention a commission presided over oy a aisunguisiieu publicist appointed in pursuance of the request of both na Hons, by His Majesty, the Emperor of Bi-azil, has been organized and has be gun its sessions in this city. A congress to consider means lor the protection of industrial property has recently been in session in Paris, to which I have en- pointed the ministers of the United States in France and in Belgium ns del egates. The international commission unon weight and measures continues its work tn Paris. I invite your attention to the necessity of aa appropriation to lie made in time to enable this government to comply with its obligations under the metrical convention. Our friendly relations, with the Ger man empire continue without inter ruption. At the recent international exhibition of fish nud fisheries, at Berlin, the par ticipation of the United States, notwith standing the haste with which the com mission was forced to make its prepara tions, was extremely successful and meritorious, wiuning for private exhibit ors numerous awards of a high class, and for the country at large the principal prize oi nonorourea by llis .lasty the Emperor. The result of this great suc cess cannot but be advantageous la this important and growing in dustry. There is nothing of importance to note in our unbroken friendly relation wun the governments or Australia, Hun gary, Russia, Portugal. Sweden. Norway. Switzerland, Turkey and Greece. Dur thc last summer" several vessels belong ing to the merchant marine or this country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at, boarded, and searched, by an armed cruiser of the Spanish government. The circumstan ces aa. reported, involve not only a pri vate injury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too little observant of the fricudly relations existing for a cen tury between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the mat ter is undergoing investigation by the royal authorities, with a view to such ex planation or reparation as may be. call ed for by the facts. The provision made by congress at its last session for the expense of tho com mission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations in regard to the relations of the United Statesand China enabled the commissioners to proceed at once upon their mission. The imperi al government was prepared to give us, something I raiirrraas tvtn- blessing from tlii nifit tnsirk imnniviimftntd hus lumn I . . , .1 .

" . - In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence ut quiet on the border between this country and Mexico would soon become so assurt-ti as to justify the modification ot the orders then in force to our military commanders in regard to crossing the frontier without encouraging such dis turbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries. Events moved in accordance with these expectations and the orders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satistnction of our own cit izens and the Mexican government. Subsequently the peace of the border was again disturbed oy savages, com manded bv Chief Victoria, but by the combined and harmonious action of the military forces of both countries, his band has been broken up and substan tially destroyed. There is reason to be- j lieve that tho obstacles which have so long prevented rapid and convenient communication between the united States and Mexico by railways are on the point of disappearing, and that sev. eral Important enterprises of this char acter will soon be set on foot, which can not fail to contribute largely to the pros- ity ot both countries- , 

TR.IDE AN'S COU1IKUCE. .. The efforts of the department, ot state to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United States through the active agency of consular officers and through the dissemination ot information ' ob tained from them, have been unrelaxed. The interest in these efforts, as developed in our commercial communities and the value of the information secured by this means to the trade and ' manufac tories of the country, were recognized bv congress at its last session, and a pro vision was mane lor the more frequent publication- of the consular and other reports by the department of the state. The first issue of this publication is now prx-imred, and subsequent- issues a. ay regularly be expected. The im imrtance and interest attached to the re ports of consular officers ar witnessed by the general demand for tbem by all classes of, merchant and manu facturers engaged in onr foreign trade. It is believed that the system of such publications is de serving of the approval of congress, and that the necessary appropriations for its continuance and enlargement will com mend itself to your consideration. The prosperous energies of our domestic in dustries and their immense production of the subjects of foreign commerce in vite and even require an active devel opment of the wishes and interests of our people in that direction. Especially important is it that our commercial re lations with he Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and -the Gulf of Mextea,--should be direct, and not through the circuit of European systems, and should be car ried on in our bottoms. The full ap preciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China and the East Indies, with Austra lia and the island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should in spire efforts to appropriate .to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital, a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modifications of our regula tions of trade and navigation may be necessary or useful to meet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and of our crrying trade, I am sure the wisdom of congress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention It seems to be very evident that the pro visions of regular steam postal commission by aid from the government bos" been the fore runner of the commercial predominance of Great Britain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the desire and the interest of our people. It is also manifest that the ef forts of other European nations to -contest" with Great Britain for n share of this commerce have been successful in proportion with their adoption of 'regu lar steam postal commiinicatioins"With the market whose trade they sought. Mexico and the states of South America are anxious to receive such postal com munications with this country, and to aid in their developement. Similar co operation may be looked for in due time from the eastern nations and from Aus tralia. It is difficult to see how the lead in this movement can lie expected from private interests. In respect to foreign commerce, quiet as much as in interna tional trade, postal communication seems necessarily a matter of common and public administration, aud thus per taiuing to government. I respectfully rccouiiuend to yoir prompt attention such just and efficient measures us may conduce to thu development of our for eign commercial exchanges and the building up of our carrying trade. In this connection 1 desire, also to suggest the very great service w hich might be expecte'd in enlarging aud faciliatiog our commerce in the Pacific ocean, were a trans-marine cable laid from San frail -Cisco to the Sandwich Islam!, and thence to Japan at the north, and Aus tralia at the south, and the great influ ence of such means of communication on these routes of navigation in devel oping aud securing the due share of en forcement, und it may be that such an ccterprise, useful and in the end profita able as it would prove to private invest ments, may need to be accelerated by prudent legislation by congress in its aids, and I submit the. mutter -to your careful consideration. FIXAXCIAI.. The condition of the financial affairs of the government, as shown'- by he report of the secreta ry of the treasury, is very . .satisfac tory. It is believed that the present itnanciai situation ot tne' United States, whether considered with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth or the extent and variety of our wsonrces is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any country at any period of its history. All our industries are thriving, the rate of interest is iow, new rail roadsvare being coustructed, and a vast immigration is increasing our popuinuon, capital ana labor. JNew en. tcrprises in great numbers are in pro gress and our commercial relations with other countries are improving. riuoiwiiiiiu -f flrtt-ff fi mi -n tltruiitn tt - ....... ... .. ...j - , u-d 1 it 1 id i nini Kiitrv of the Union and direptlv at the bead of THE OKDIKABY REVENUES. from all source for the fiscal year ended june sw, issu, were: jiTom customs. i ooiis,oot,ou ; irom ; internal revenue, 124,009,373.92; from Bales of public lands, $1,016,506.60; from tax on the circulation and deDOsita of national banks, $7,014,971.44; from re-payment of interest oy uie jracinc railway compa nies. $1,707,387 18; from sinking funds for Pacific railway companies, $766,621.. ;iromtnoms, lees, lines, penalties, ete, $1,148,800.16; from fees, consular letters, patent and lands, $2,327,039.00 ; from proceeds of sales of government property, $282,618.50; from profits on coinage, etc, $3,793,186.78; from reve nues of the District of Columbia.tl.8fl0.. 409.70: from . miscellaneous . aonrcpa $4,099,003 PS r total ordinary receint w- ' Kto ..

The aggregate of the revenues from all sources during the 'fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, was $333.526.610.98 an increase over the precedding year of $59,699,426.52. ' The receipts thus far of tne current year together with the esti mated receipts for the remainder of the year amount to $350,000,000 which will be sufficient to meet ' the estimated ex penditures of the year and leave a sur plus of $90,000,000. 

LET'S PAY OUR DEBTS. It is fortunate that this large surplus of revenue occurs at a period when it may be directly applied to the payment of tne puouc ueot soon to be redeemable. jo public duty has been more constant ly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as rapidly as possible. The debt of the United States, less the cash in the treas ury and exclusive of accruing interest. attained its maximum, $2,756,431,571.43 in August, 1865, and has since that time been reduced to $1,886,019,504.65. Of the principal of the debt $108,758,100 has been paid since March 1, 1877, ef fecting an annual saving of interest of $6,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale of bonds bearing a low rate of interest and the application or the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1877, is $14,290,453.50. Within a short period over six hundred millions of 5 and 6 per cent, bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity, not only to further reduce the principal of the debt, but also to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention of congress to the views ex pressed on this subject by the secretary of the treasury in his annual report, and recommend prompt legislation to enable the treasury department to complete the reiunaing ot tne aeot, wmch is about to mature. The continuance of specie payments has not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival ot business, and to our remarkable pros perity. The fears that preceded and ac companied resumption have proved groundless. No considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sums of gold1 bullion, both domestic and im ported, are taken to the mints and ex changed for coin or notes. The increase or coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, 1879, is estimated at $227,399,428. There arc still in existence, uncanceled. $346,681,016 of United States legal ten. der notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the united States was then engaged. The preservation of the nation's existence re quired, in the judgment of congress, an issue oi legal tender paper money, lhat it served well the purpose for which it was created is not questioned, but the employment of the notes as paper mon ey indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the object for which tbey were pro- viaea, was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. These notes long since be came like any other pecuniary obliga tion ot the gererninent a debt to be paid, and, when paid, . to be canceled as mere evidence of an indebtedness no longer existing. I therefore repeat what was said in the annual message of last year, that the retirement from circula tion ot United States notes, with the ca- pacity-of legal tender in private con tracts, is a step to be taken in our pro gress towards a sale and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government and the in terest and security of the people. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of sliver dollars, fixing their value and giv ing them legal tender character, it was believed by many of the supporters of the measure that the silver dollar, which it authorized, would speedily become, under the operations of the law, of equiv alent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted as to the probabili ty of this result, nevertheless were wil ling togive the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to etop the coin age, if experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill con. tinued to be of less commercial yjjue than the standard gold dollar, THE 

COIXAOE OF SILVER DOLLARS. under the act referred to, began in March, 1878, and has been continued as required by the act. The average rate per month to the present time has been $2,276,492., Tb total amount coined prior to the 1st imntif.p-a i u i in- . 1- . I ill mi' illinium. the second flight I PI im -nuvenioer last was $72,847,750. Of uua amount ,us4,450 remain in the toeasury. and only $25,763,291 are in the hands of the people. A constant effort umm ueea suae w seep this currency in circulation, and considerable expense has been necessarily incurred for this purpose, .but its return to the treasury is i me. vxjDirarv io me con fident anticipation of the friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the " me anver dollar, containr 412 pains of silver, has not increased. Dur ing the year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its col value of the silver which it contained was from ninety to ninetv.two vuujnmi win uie stanuara gold dollar. During the last year the average market tbiuo 04 iue silver aoiiar nas been eighty eight and a half cents. It is obvious that the legislation of the last congress in regard to silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of silver, as a result of that legis- I 1 . 1 r , .. . tsuun, uu laneu io proauce lue ettect then predicted. The longer the law re mains in force, requiring as it does the coinage or a nominal dollar, which, in rauiiy, is not a aoiiar. tne greater be comes the dansrer that this rountrv u-m be forced to accept a single metal as the sole legal standard of value in circula tion, and tliis standard of less value than it purports to be worth in the recognized money of the world. DOUBLE ASD SINGI.K STANDARD. The constitution of the United SimM sound financial principles and our best interests, all require that the country should have as its legal-tender money, both gold and silver coin, of an intrinsic value, as bullion, equivalent to that wuiiu, upon its lace, it parports to pos- acoa. x ub constitution, in express terms, recognises both gold and silver as the oniy true legal-tender money. To ban IsU either of these metals from our cur. rency is to narrow and limit the circula ting medium of exchange to the dispar agement ot important interests. The United States produces more silver than any other country, and it is directly in teres ted in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage or the world. It will, in mv judgment, contribute to this result if congress will repeal so much of existtng legislation as reauires the coinsge of sil ver dollars containing 412 grains of uver, ana in us stead will authorize the secretary of the treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will be in accordance with familiar precedents. Con mess. on several occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver in or der to establish it more nearly in accor dance with the actual ratio of value be tween the two metals. In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations has been found by experience to deminish the rates of interest which debtors are required to pay und to increase the fa cility with which money can be obtain ed for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely money becomes abundant when ever confidence in the exact performance oi moneyed obligations is established. - THE WAR 

DEPARTMENT. The secretary of war reports that the expenditures of the war depart ment for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880. were $39,924,773.03. The appropriations for this department for the current fiscal year amount to $41,993,630.40. With respect to the army, the secretary invites attention to the fact that its strength is limited by statute (section 1,115, revised statutes) to not more than 30.000 enlisted men. but that provisos contained in appropriation bills have limited expenditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed the full legpl strength, is the least possi ble torce at which the present organiza tion can be maintained, having in view efficiency, discipline and economy. While the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation for pay of the army, the saving made in other respects would be more than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficientcy of the army would be largely increased. The report of the officer in charge of EDUCATION IK THE ARMY shows that there are seventy-eight schools now in operation in the army. with an aggregate attendance of 2,305 en listed men and children. The secretary recommends the enlistment of 150 schoolmasters with tho rank and pay of commissary sergeants. An appropria tion is needed to supply the judge advo cates of the army with suitablo libraries, and the secretary recommends that the corps of judge advocates be placed upon the same footing, as to promotion, with the other staff corps of the army. Un der existing laws, the bureau of military justice consists of one officer, the judge advocate general, and the corps of judge advocates, of eight officers of equal rank (majors.) with a provision that the limit of the corps shall remain at four when reduced by casuality or resignation to that number. The consolidation of the bureau of military justice, and the corps of judge advocates, upon the same basis with the other staff corps ot the army, would remove an unjust discrimination against deserving officers, and subserve the best interests of the service. RIVER IMPROVEMENTS. The president next favors a judicious use of the public money for the improve ment of our great water courses. The two great rivers of the North American continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia, baye their navigable waters wholly within the limits of the United States, and are of vast importance to our internal and foreign commerce. The permanency of the important work on the south pass ot the Mississippi river seems now to de assured. There has been no failure whatever in the malntalnance of the maximum channel daring the six months ended August 9, last. This experiment has opened a broad deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement, upon the permanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among the peeple abroad and at Dome, ana especially among tne com munities - of the Mississippi valleys. whose commercial exchanges float in aa unobstructed channel safely to snd from the sea. A comprehensive improvement of the Mississippi and its tributaries is a mat ter of transcendant Importance. These great water-ways comprise a system of inland, transportation spread like net work over a large portion of the United States, and navigable to the extent of many thousands ot miles, producers and consumers alike have a common in terest in such -nnequaled- facilttes for cheap transportation..- Geographically, commercially and politically, they are tne strongest tie Del ween tne various tioas of (he cone try. 11 1 pvnminp TBJSK CHAXSELS OP COMMUNICATION and intercnange are the property of the nation. Its jurisdiction is permanent over their waters, and the plainest prin ciples of public interest require their in telligent and careful supervision, with a Tlpw to their protection, improvement, and the enhancement of their nseful ness. The channel of the Columbia river for a distance of about 100 miles from its month, is obstructed by a succession of bars, which occasion serious delays in navigation, and heavy expenses tor litherage and towage. A depth of at least twenty feet at low tide should secured aud maintained to meet the re quirements of the extensive and growing inland and ocean commerce it subserve. The most urgent need, however, for this great waterway is a permanent improve ment of the channel at the month of the river. . From Columbia riter to San Francis. co, a distance of over 600 miles, there is no harbor on our Pacific cost which can be approrched during stormy weather. An appropriation of $150,000 was made by the forty-fifth congress, for the com mencement of a breakwater and harUir . of refuge, to be located at some point tietween the Straits, of Fuca and San Francisco, at which the necessities of commerce, local and general, will .be best accommodated. The amount ap preprinted is thought to lie ouite inade quate for the purpose intended. The cost of the work, when finished, will be very great, owing to the want of natural advantages for a site at any point on th coast between the designated limit's, and it has not been thought to be advisable to undertake the work without a larger appropriation. I commend the maiter to the attention of congress. THE NAVY DEPARTMENT. The report of the secretary of the navv exhibits the successful and satisfactory management of that department during the last fiscal year. The toial expendi tures for the year were $12,916,ft!9.4, leaving unexpended at the close of the year, 2,141,682.23 ot the amount of available appropriations. The aonro- priations for the present fiscal year end ing June 30, 1881. are $15,095,061.45: and the total estimates for the next fiscal year ending June SO, 1882, are $15,953.- - in in... . j i . t.u. iu auiuiuiiuniwa uv warrant from July 1, 1880, to November 1, 1880. is $5,041,570.45. THE POSTAL SERVICE. The report of the Dostmaster-general exhibits the continued growth and the high state of efficiency of the postal ser vice. The operations f no denartnieni of the government, perhaps, represent with greater exactness the increase- in the population and the business of tin country. In 1860, the postal receipts were $8,518,067.40; in 1S80, the receipts were $33,815,479.34. All the inhabitants of the country are directly and personal! v interested in having proper mail facili ties, and naturally watch the post office very closely. This careful oversight on the part of the people has proved a con-' stant stimulus to improvement. During the past year there was an increase of 2,134 post offices, acd the mail routes were extended 27,177 miles, making an additional annual transportation of 10.- 804,191 miles. The revenues of the posi tal service for the ensuing year are esti mated at $38,845,174.10, and the expendi tures at $43,475,932, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the treasury of $3,030,7-57.90. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. The report of the secretary of the in terior presents an elaborate account of the operations of lhat department dur ing the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to be in a more hopeful condi tion now than ever before. The Indians have made gratifying progress in agriculture, herding and mechanical pur suits. Many who a few years ago were in hostile conflict with the government are quietly settling down on farms where they hope to make their permanent homes, building houses and engaging in the occupations of civilized life. The introduction of the freighting business among them has been remarkably fruit ful of good results, in giving many of them congenial and remunerative em ployment, and in stimulating their ambi tion to earn their own support. Their honesty, fidelity and efficiency as car riers are highly praised. The organiza tion of a police forco of Indians hits been equally successful in maintaining law and order upon the reservations, and in exercising a wholesome moral in fluence among the Indinas themselves. I concur with the secretary of the inter ior in the recommendation that the pay of this force be increased, as an induce ment to tho best class of young men t enter it. The message further informs us that much more care and attention has been given to the education of the Indians, but the efforts of the government i greatly crippled for want of money. Some few boarding schools have been started at the agencies. The Normal school at Hampton, Virginia, is doing well, and the Indian school at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, has 200 students. He congratulates the country that a costly Indian war has been prevented by the agreement with the Utes by which thev surrendered their largo reservation and a greet I to settle on other lands in sever alty. AGRICULTURE. The commissioner ot agriculture ex presses the confident belief lhat his ef forts in behalf of the production of onr own sugar and tea have been encourag ingly rewarded. The importance of the results attained have attracted marked attention at home, and have received the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea, and the manufacture of our own sugar would make a difference of many millions of dollars annually to the wealth of the nation. 

DISTRICT OF OOLCMBIA ASD WA8HINGTOX. I again commend the general interests of the District of Columbia to the favora ble consideration ot congress. The af fairs of the district, as shown by the re port of the commissioners, are in a very satisfactory condition. In my annual messages heretofore, and in my special message of December 19." 1879, 1 have urged upon the attention of congress the necessity of reclaiming t he marshes of the Potomac adjacent to th capital, and I am constrained by its im portance to advert again to the subject. These fiats embrace an area of several hurt dred acres. They are an impediment to the drainage of the city, and seriously impair its health. It is believed that with this substantial improvement of its river front, the capital would be inaU respects, one of the most attractive cities m the world. It should not be forgot ten that the land acquired will probanly be worth the cost of reclaiming it, anil that the navigation ot the river will be greatly improved. fronts nnd n 'CLS n.Ml we
