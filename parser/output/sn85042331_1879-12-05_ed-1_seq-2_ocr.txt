Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of •Hepretentatives: The members of tbeFerty lixth Congress have assembled in the first reg­ ular session, under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowl­ edgment to the giver of all good, for the large and universal measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred in our public af­ fairs since last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the government directly affecting the "business interests of the country. THE 

RESUMPTION ACT. I congratulate Congress on the successful ex­ ecution of the resumption act at the time fixed and in the manner contemplated, by law. The notes of the United States began to be re­ deemed in coin since the lBt of January last, and they have been promptly redeemed on pre­ sentation and in business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country. They are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively smaller and the voluntary deposits of coin and bullion in exchange for noteB have been very large. The excess of prccious metals deposited or ex­ changed for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed, is about $40,000,000. The resumption of specie payment has. been followed by a very great re­ vival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled Co enter upon equal competi­ tion with other nations in trade and produc­ tion. The increasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in sold from the 1st of July last to November 15 to the amount of about $69,000,000. REFUNDING OPERATIONS. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. Bonds of the government bearing only four per cent, in­ terest have been sold at or above par sufficient in amount to pay off all the national debt which was redeemable under the present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds Bold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which'ma tures within lesB than two years is $792,121, 700,' of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of five per cent, and the balance is in bonds bearing 6 per cent, interest. It is be­ lieved that this part of the public debt can be refunded by theissuecf 4 per ct. bonds, and by 'the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $10,000,000 can be annually saved to the treasury. To secure this import­ ant reduction of interest to be paid by the United States further legislation is required, which it ia hoped will be provided by Congress during the present session. 

GOLD AND SILVER COINAGE. The coinage of gold by the mints of theUnit. ed States during the last fiscal year was $400, 986,912. The qpinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose, report­ ed Nov. 1, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,844«have been issued from the treasury and are now in circulation and $32,300,506 are •till in the possession of the government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of ac­ tion before the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a 'permanent Bystetn of equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend tkat Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions which may well be awaited before attempting further ex­ perimental measures with the coinage. I wonld, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authorizing the secretary of the treasury to suspend the coinage of Bilver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The mar­ ket value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation, it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver which shall be of equivalent' value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. RETIREMENT OF LEGAL TENDERS. The retirement from circulation of United StateB noteB with the capacity of the legal ten­ der in private contracts is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy of the government and the interest and security of the people of it. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender money, money based wholly on the authority and credit of the government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the constitution and a vio­ lation of Bound financial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals was not authorized except as a means for rescuing the country from immi­ nent peril. The circulation of these notes for paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. They' an­ ticipate. the redemption and withdrawal of the notes at the'earliest practicable period consist­ ent with the attainment of the object for /which they were provided. The Policy of the ^United States Bteadily adhered to from the 'adoption of the constitution has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when from necessity in time of war, debtshave been cre­ ated, they have been paid off on return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public, debt ..within a limited period, be maintained. Jf any change of the objects or rates of taxation ia deemed necessary by Congress it ip suggested, experience has shown, a duty can be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the of those ar tides to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars an n^allytotbe treasury.•V .. MOBKONISM. The continued deliberate violation, by a large numberof prominent and idfliential citizens of the Territory of Utah, of the laws of the United States.for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy, merits the attention of every de­ partment of the government. This Territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to ad­ mission as. a State. This- important change will not. however, be approved by the country while the citizens "of Utah, in very considera­ ble numbers, uphold a practice which is con­ demned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with unanimitybyCongreiss more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah because of the peculiar difficulties attending its en­ forcement. The opinion widely prevailed among citizens of Utah that the law was in contradiction of the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. The supreme court of the United States has decided the law to be within 1 the legislative power of Congress, binding as a rule of action for fell who roside within the.Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and ef­ fectually executed. If not sufficiently strin­ gent in the provisions, it should be amended, and in aid of the purposes in view, I recom mend more comprehension and more searching methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime, be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enfqrcemant of law on this sub­ ject. PROTECTION OT THE BALLOT. The elections of the past year, though. occu­ pied only with State offices, have not failed to elicit in political discussions' which attended them all over the country new and decisive evi­ dence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country towards a more general and complete establish­ ment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political con­ cern demand great attention from our people, both in tho sphere of national and State au­ thority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interests of the government, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defense of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and that all sectional and State attachment in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing and carry with them unchallenged security and. respect. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens, of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinion on other political sub jets, to unite in compelling obedience to exist­ ing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of the executive and legislative authorities of States in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on the para­ mount question of popular rights, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country or retard the gen­ eral diffusion of prosperity. 

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. In a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the reformation of the civil service of the government, and expressed an intenti on, transmitting to Congress as early as practicable, a report upon this subject by the chairman of the civil service commission. In view of the fact, during a considerable period, the government of Great Britain has been deal­ ing with the administative problems and abuses in. various particulars analogous to those presented in this country, and that recent years the measures adopted were under­ stood to have been effective and in every re­ spect highly satisfactory, I thought desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairman of the civil service commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elaborate and comprehensive report. The report BetB san Bpoil forth the history of the parti­ system in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage and of official interference with the freedom 'of elections, Bhows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to nil, and which are carried on under the superin­ tendence of a single commission, have with great advantage been established as the con­ dition of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The com­ pletion of the report, owisg to the extent of the labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the expenses of the commission, has beien postponed until the present time.' It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While the reform measures of an­ other government are of no authority to us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our constitutions and social life may com­ mend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the de­ fects and abuses in our civil administration, remain unchanged except in so far as an en­ larged experience has deepened my sense of the duty, both of officers and of the people themselves, to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to office, and of the of­ fice tenure, are now generally recognized. In the resolutions o£ the great parties, in reports of departments, in the debates and proceed­ ings of Congress, the messages of executives, the gravity cf the evils has been admitted. To command the necessary support every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties' which are inevitable and essential in a free State. When people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence in the officers they have selected and the advisers who, in accord­ ance with our political institutions Bhould be consulted as to the policies which it is their duty to carry into effect, is unquestionable. It is eminently proper they should explain to the people, as well as illnstrate its spirit in the performance of their official duties. It hardly need be pointed out that 'very different con­ siderations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their public service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of par­ tisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power, and what­ ever policy prevails. As a consequence, it follows that their .terms of' office should not depend upon the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party. but should be de­ termined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure, should also prevail in the appointment, discipline ahd removol of those subordinate. The authority of appointment, and, removal is not a perquisite which may' be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercisedin/thp' ., public inter­ est. The onlyjust ground of discrimination is the measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most. useful to the peo­ ple, except in cases when upon jnst and recog­ nized principles, it is upon the theory of pen­ sions, offices and promotion are bestowed aa rewards for past services. Their bestowal up­ on any theory which£disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breech of that trust subject/to' which the ap pointingpower is held. In the light of these principles, it becomes, of great.importance to provide just and ade­ quate means, especially for every department, or a large administrative office where personal discrimination on the part of the head is not practicable for ascertaining those qualifications to which appointments and removals should have reference. To fail to .provide such meanB. is not only to deny the opportunity of ascer­ taining fusts upon which the moat righteous claims to office depend, but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appointments and removals to mere influence and favoritism. If fit ib the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the interest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertain­ ing personal fitness for office must needs be an important and paramount function of every wise and just government. It has long since become impossible in the great offices for those having the duty of nom­ ination and appointment to personally enquire into the individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlargement of the civil service, that proportion must continue to become less. In the earlier years of the government the subor­ dinate offices were so few in number that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of the candidates. Party managers of methods had not then become powerful agen­ cies of coercion, hostile to the free and juBt exercise of the appointing power. A large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests on the President, and it has been my purpose to do what is in my power to advance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will moBt surely bring about the rad­ ical change of system essential to make our ad­ ministrative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people. By a proper exercise of au­ thority it iB in the power of the executive to do much to promote Biich a reform, and it cannot be too clearly understood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operation on the part of Congress, and a considerate and intelligent sup­ port among the people. Reforms which cha'lebge the generally accepted theories of parties, and demand changes in methods of departments, are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound principles and in an experience which demon­ strates their wisdom, and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Every woithy officer desires to make his official action a gain and honor to his country, but the people themselves, far more than their officers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical and vigorous administration. By laws enacted in 1S53 and 1855, and now in substance incorporated in the revised stat­ utes. the practice of arbitrary appointmeats to the subordinate grades in the departments was condemned, and examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of ex­ aminers, were provided for and made condi­ tions of admission to the public service. These statutes area decision by Congress that exam­ inations of some sort as to attainments and capacity, are essential to the well being of the public service. The important questions Bince the enactment of these laws have been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence, or common right and merit, were to control ac­ cess to the examinations in practice. These examinations have not always been open to worthy personB generally. who_ might wish to be examined. Official favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated, those who alone were permitted to go before the examining board, subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence the standard of ad­ mission fell below that which the public inter­ est demanded. It was also almost inevitable that a system which provides for various boards of examiners with no common supervision or uniform measure of procedure should result in confusion and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public interests. A further and more radical change was obviously required. In the annual messsge of. December,' 1870, my predecessor declared that "there is no duty which BO embarrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labors imposed on .Senators and Representatives as finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men and often does not tit men for public places. The eleva­ tion and purification of the civil service of the government will be hailea with approval by the whole people of the United States." Congress accordingly passed the act ap­ proved March 3,1S71, to regulate the civil ser­ vice of the United States and promote the ef­ ficiency thereof, giving the necessary authori ity to'the executive to inaugurate a civil ser­ vice reform. Acting under the statute, which .waH interpreted as intending to secure a system of just and effectual examinations under uni­ form supervision, a number of eminently com­ petent persons wer§ selected for the pur­ pose, who entered with zeal upon the discharge of the duties pre­ pared, with an intelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service and regulations, and who, in their capacity as a board, have been known as the civil ser rice commissioners. Congress for two years appropriated the money needed fgi the compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the commission. It appears from the re­ port of the commission submi' ted to the Presi­ dent in April, 1S74, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appropriation of about $25,000 would be required to meet the annual ex­ penses, including the salaries involved. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message on April IS, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon toe labors of the'com­ mission "If sustained by Congress, I have no donbt the rnles can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the -public seryice and relieve the executive, members of Congress and the heads of departments from influences prej­ udicial to good administration. The rules, as th&y have hitherto been enforced, have result­ ed beneficially as is shown by the opinions of the members of the cabinet and their subordi­ nates in the departments, and in that opinion I concur." And in the annual message of December of the same year similar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing the work of the commission again advised. The appro­ priation was not made, and as a consequence the active work of the commissioners was sus­ pended, leaving the commission itself in ex­ istence without the means therefor of causing qualifications to be tested in any systematic manner, or of securing for the public service the advantages of competition upon any ex­ tensive plan. I recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropria­ tion for the resumption of the work of the commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations under many embarrassments, have been conducted withinlimited,spheres in the executive de­ partments Washington and in a number of the custom houses and postoffices of the prin­ cipal cities of the country, with a view to tur- $ ther test their effects, and in .every instance have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to be under the administration of my predecessor. Lthiark parity and efficiency of ^S^ub# «nRe would be greatly promoted by their systematic intro­ duction, wherever practicable throughout the entire civil service of the government, togeth­ er with ample, provision for their 'general supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. Reports from the secretary of the interior, from the postmaster general, from the post­ master in the city ofNew York, where Bcope Such examinations have been for sometime on trial, and also' from the collector of the port, the na­ val officers and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, shjW that the competi­ tive system, where applied, has in various ways contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a .marked degree, and that a general application of similar rules cannot fail to be a decided benefit to the service. The reports of the gov­ ernment officers in the city of New York es­ pecially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examination in their re­ spective offices, showing that these examina­ tions and the excellent qualfications of those submitted to the service through them have had a marked effect upon the persons previ­ ously in the'service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on the part of the latter au increased interest in the work and a desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the par­ ticular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised.' The examina­ tion have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investi­ gate the and character of the tests, and the method of determining the results, and those visitors have without exception approved the methods employed, and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion. Upon such consideration I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation contained in my annual message December, 1877, requesting Congress to make the necessary appropria­ tions for the resumption of the work of the civil service commission: Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate compen­ sation to persons in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under the commission, as the executive may direct. I am convinced that if a just and adequate test of merit is enforced for admission to the pub­ lic service in making promotions, such abuses as removals without good canse, and partisan and official interference with the proper exer­ cises of the appointing power, will in a large measure disappear. There aie ether administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress shonld be asked in this connection. Mere partisan ap­ pointments and the constant peril of removal without cause, very naturally lead to an ab­ sorbing and mischevious political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which net onlyinterferes with the due discharge of official duty, nut iB incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not without warrant in the views of several of my predecessors in the Presidential office, and directly within the law of 1871 al­ ready cited, I endeavored by regulation made on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some rea­ sonable limits to such abuses. It, may not be easy and it may never, per­ haps, be necessary to defipe with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of federal officers', but while their right to |hold and freely express their opinions can-not be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their official dnties, nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political action of those who hold different opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy, quite analagous to those which forbid the use of official power for the oppres­ sion of the private citizen, impose upon the government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies for party purposes upon the salaries of officers, is highly demoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen from using bis own money in aid of his opinion or hiB party, be Bhonld als- be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensation for time ahd labor of the officers it is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in or­ der that they may bear a tax, the excess is in­ direct robbery of the public funds. I reccommend therefore Buch a revision and extension of the present statutes. as shall se­ cure to those in every grade of official life or public employment, the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful in its service.
