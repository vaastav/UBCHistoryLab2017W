BILL OF SECRETARY GAGE. The bill submitted by Secretary Gage and offered In the House yesterday Is avowedly In? tended rather to elicit dlacusslon and to pre? pare the way for what the Secretary regards as a comprehensive measure of reform than with expectation that It will be adopted at this ses? sion. Secretary Gage Is too able and experienced to look for Its adoption, and the single fact that the President, while commending the recom? mendations of his Secretary to the considera? tion of Congress, proposed a much limpiar meas? ure, and one less likely to excite differences of opinion, makes it clear that no action at this ses? sion along the whole line of the Secretary's sug? gestions is to be expected. No one can read the statement of the Secretary before the committee Df the House. In connection with the bill submit? ted, and his annual report explaining its pur? pose, without giving high praise to Mr Gage for his frankness and complete sincerity; and his entire patriotism of purpose none will question. He thoroughly believes, beyond a doubt, that the plan he proposes Is fitted to the needs of the country. That there are many who have not the same conception of the public needs or of the right remedy, he cordially recognizes. But he does not seek in the least to conceal from view those features of his plan which may meet greatest opposition. It is necessary to a full comprehension of the measure that the ultimate purpose, as stated bv Mr. Gage himself, should be clearly understood before Its details are examined. In hie Initial statement he said the bill was "a first step tow "ard a system of banknote Issues without the "conditional deposit of public bonds as secur? ity." Later he said In ans?ver to Inquiries, aa reported, that the measure was "a first step "toward withdrawal of tho Government guar? antee for banknote?, and Interdependence be "tween banks and the Government." These ?tatement? are consistent and honorably frank, and challenge the attention of those who do not desire to take a first step In that direction. To Mr. Gage, as to many bankers, it appears the only wise nnd safe solution of existing dithVultlea. but his annual leport shows that he is not blind to existing "prejudices regard? ing banks," and is aware that tbe point of the prejudice is the popular feeling that the volume of circulation should not be within the control of thoe?? interested as lend rs. it would hare been easy for a less candid and mar,]?? ofhVinl to gloss over the tendency of his plan, and It Is greatly to the credit of Mr. Oaejc that he invi?, s public Judgment on jatatAttelj that point. It m easy to see that the prorlaion for ? drcnlatloQ ? In egeess of the amount secured by bond de- ' posits is designed to gccustoin the pubi;?? mind to a new cbtlinat?? of tbe value of note?, noi according to the bonds bcblnd tbem, but ao cording to the or ? n?ce and so indnea? of th bank? from Wbtc] y emanale ??? explain? that, as the people nn now a.-ciist??ined to look for bonded security for notes, he retain? thut feature for the preeent. hut l***d*jeeg the inu-res; on bonds held as security to SM per cent. Some banker? and financiers of exprrienee already question whether such a bond might not fall be? low par, in case of foreign disturbance or any other severe ?lnnneial strain, and fear that if that ?hould happen the dlstn.st of a pttOffl? long acenstomed to 10 per cent marge bet men the par value of 4 per cent b.tids and th?? runount of notes (?sued ?gainst them might r.>n<W the proposed plan Insecure. Such doubts the Secre? tary presumably expects to meet and remove before the measure be propose? can be passed. But be manfully make? It clear that bonded s<? ?trurlty of any kind does not seem to him a pe:?? mauent part of a wise system of currency. The proposal to create a separate department of the Tree? ? it? for Issue and Redemption ha? met the approval of many eminent Quanclers. I Tbe une objection to it thus far seem? to ? l?e that tha? advent of a different President or j gai'tctaij <?r Congx?? might deprive tbe pi*?, of practical usefulness. Indeed, one suggestion in I the plan of Mr? Q*8* seems to open the que? ! tlon whether the two departments could be in ' fact kept ???parate in nil contingencies, since it provides for exchange of one kind of money in ' tlie Treasury f??r another kind In the Issue De? partment Hut In the end all such nrrango ! meats must depend, exactly uh the solvency of 1 the Treasury and the soundness of the currency ! now depend, upon the willingness of the people t?. sustain an uprigbl and wi*'? policy. If they remain frilling and determined do system can , thwart ? hem. and 1G they are not Willing and determined no restraints can bind them. No man who belli vei in sound money will question the entire propriety of Secretary Gage'a pro? posal !.? require redemption in gold ?ml pay to ?nt of bonda In gold; i"?t ';'? I? now, as II ?ras j in tbe laal Congress, questionable whether a bill to that end can be passed in the Renate. The proposal t.? take up af200.000.000 of leu-al tendera through National banks wiebln?* to ex? tend their circulation, to place tbe notet in th?? I ? Dei>artroent nnd give the hanks U'j per cent gold bomi.- for them, and ?" five them f"r issu?? Instead *2u0, 00,000 of bank not.???, with th?? pledge of tbe ? ...vernini nt for their re? demption, i?? obviously not s contraction of the . nrr.'ocy. It is. of coir-se. ques ione.' In Con groas whether Goverameni will gain in any wgjy ?, compi risate for Its bonda to pay ?G?,???, 000 in gold each year, and in committee it ?a it? urgvd ihar the substitution of ? banknote guaranteed hy Government .era legal-tender noie issued by Government, would noi lesson the demand obligations of the Treasury, but would leave to the banks the necessity ..f main? taining the parity of gold, silver and paper In circulation. On question? of this nature, doubtless. Secretary (?age will explain more fully at the continued bearing to-day. I Is statement already shows that his great practical experience as a banker enables him to meet effectively many of the objections which are raised to his plan. On one point fuller ex planntlon is perhaps desirable to remove the difficulty of those who think the volume of paper circulation too large already, whereas the issue of banknotes In place of $200,000,000 Government notes surrendered to the Issue He part nient and the additional Issue of more banknotes without bonded security, but with the guarantee of redemption by Government, would appear to Inflate ihe paper circulation. The taxation of 2 per cent on such unsecured Issues would In ordinary times limit them, but It is well to hnve clear assumnce that the limita? tion would serve In time? of tendency toward Inflation. The plan of the Secretary merits the rarefili consideration which It Invites. At the same time Its examination makes tha? fact clearer than It was befor*? that no other measure of currency reform has as much chance of success at this session as the simple measure proposed by the President. If all those who sincerely seek such reform concentrate their efforts reso? lutely in support of the President's sugesti?n. the session may not be fruitless. But if they scatter their forces, each man urging the measure which seems to him nearest perfec? tion, while the opposition stands solidly against any nnd every nieaMir.? in the rieht direction, not much good can be expected. 

THINGS TO REMEMHFR. In 1895, when General Palmer ran for Secrc tary of State, he carried the fifty-six counties outside of the Greater New-York by over 142, 000 plurality. Last m-tnth Judge Wallace, run? ning for Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, carried those same counties by nbout 77,000, the rural Republican vote having fallen off in two years under the leadership of Mr. Platt about fV?,0OO. Last year Mr. McKinley had a large non-partisan support, but Mr. Black mal his campaign on partisan lines, and his support represented the sentiment In favor of Repub? lican rule in this State Yet In one year that amiable disposition toward th?? party has been so altered by Mr. Platt that in those rural coun? ties where he says Republican majorities were all that could be d? sired Jud^e Wallace's plu? rality was over ???,??? less than Governor Black's. Last winter Mr. Platt, again?t the advice of many of the best politicians among his sup? porters, "Jammed through" the Greater New York charter arid did up the spoils of this vast community In one package. Th?-n, in spite of the fact that this territory had a normal Demo? cratic majority, he fervid notice that he would prefer a Tammany to a non-partisan Mayor, and spent the spring In driving into opposition those whose votes he plaln'y needed to carry the city, and, as the event proved, also needed to carry the State. Instead of responding to the popular wish, Mr. Plan made war upon all Republican leaders who displayed a disposition to defer to it, and in spite of the appeals of all the independents and of thousands of Republicans he forced a division In the anti-Tammany ranks and robbed the party of the aid of l.Vi.000 voters in the metropolis. Thus be established Tammany In absolute power for four years and intrenched it for work against the election of a Republican Governor and President. At the same time he defeated Judge Wallace, for. while many Re? publicans who voted for Mr. I>ow also voted for Judge Wallace, some 00,000 of them w?>re apparently annoyed by the make-up of ihe ballot and failed to vote at all for Chief Judge. Nearly all of these vote? might have been se? cured, together with thousand?, more from Democrats, who would have been glad to vote for Judge Wallace if Mr. Platt had not Identi? fied his candidacy with the p.Q. movement to turn the city over to Tammany. If the anti Tammany vote had been milted Judge Wallace vWiiild have been elected, nnd tho only thlug that stood in the way of union was Mr. Platt. Ever sine,? election Mr. Platt and his lieuten? ants have professed their willingness to "get together" for the sake of the party. Yet they hav.? proceeded to 1?>!(1 primaries In hundreds of districts in violation of the party constitu? tion, with a view to Continuing Shclr career of party wracking. Mr. Platt ?reeked his party last fall in this city, even to ilio point a,f killin- its organUUt tlon. He wrecked it in Qvs other cities. He wrecked R In the State. He wrecked It In twenty-three Assembly .li.iricta which inst y ar chose Republican Assemblymen. Those are n few of the resulti of tin? !e,lu. ?ship which be now seeks to maintain by violating the party c.nsiim;?on. Republicans are a?!;ed to forgive him, so that the party may unite for future Victory. It li evident that to fo.-gtve him will only ma'.:.? him poloni to bring future defeal MAM! ? ? :\ 

PROPOSALS, in the published description of ihe ?lune for tl??? '-xpar.sum of tbe elevated railroad system which it is said that the Manhattan Company expects to carry out ?? Uh tbe co operation of tbe new Tammany administration, there lansjthlns to Indi? ate a change f attitude on tbe part of that corporation toward the puh!:.?. The com. pany lue always rjeen ready to extend its opera? lions on its own terms and ??<, eotsahsteatly counterfeited emotions of surprise and -rief aj the failure of the community to respond to its aspirations and ?ay new privileges at Its feet.' That is presumably Its mood to-day. and pre? sumably aleo tbe community will continue to re gard with consld?riibl?> suspicion its proposals for the development of Its present lines Into a ?eniiine rapid transit system, which will re I move all excuse f.?r underground roads and ' Dually settle '?be transportation qneation. a> The Tribune has said repeatedly, It may . be wise to lei the Manhattan Company lacrenae i its facilities, if that can be done without seri ottsly adding to the hideous disfigurement of the ! city which it baa already caused. A fair chance ? to obtain substantial sdvantages through a slight additional lacriflce ibonld not be careleesly re ! Jected merely because tbe compaay has made i Itself nnpopular by rigid adherence to a selfish I policy. Some parts of the scheme which it is said to be arranging with Tammany do not appear to be particularly ?abject! mahle The eon : strnctlon >f new tracks, for example, In ?trectg already occupied by tbe elevated rosde might : prove of irreal convealer.o tl ;.pie, wltb out materially Increasing the burden? which they now have to bear ?! la and other consld?

The co. ipany Is not repre v. nted .i-; offerir ; or even entertaining a thought of any financial recompense for additi mal priv llegcfl from which it expects to derive large profits. On that point s radical dlffereni.f opinion between the company nnd tbe public lias alwayi existed, and they never ought to come t.? aa agreement except throngh the aban? donment 01 Its position b; the company. It can well afford to pay for whal its own future quite as much ns the general convenience, require?., and it should be mads to pay. .4 "/"..;<" 

PAMPHLET. There began toc?me t.? this office a few weeka ago from newspaper offices up the State and in various parts of th?? country c ?plea of a pamphlet issued by tho Platt-Qulgg bureau entitled "Stabbed by an Old Friend-TbS New-York "Tribune Joins an Attempt to Split the Ile "publican Party." It Is similar In appearance and style to the previous Issues of the same bureau, notably to one Issued in May. lfiOfl, en? titled "??-Seuator Platt on McKlnley'a Candi? dacy," In which that gentleman aaid, among other things: My opposition to Governor McKinley proceeds almost entirely from my belief that he will ?ret the Republican party Into turmoil and trouble. He 1? not a we] ?-balanced man of affair?, a? Governor Morton la. He 1? not a great man, aa Mr Reed Is. He Is not a trained ???1 educated public man, aa Senator Allison le.

The arti !?? set f..r:ti that The Tril was Intending to "bolt" if McKinley were not nominated, and had "declared Ita allegiance to "?ie Democratic candidata fer Governor un>i? "It could name the candidate Itself."

Q. R... In the name of "the Republican campaigners." They are eight in number, and If they serve no other purpose will be convenient for refer enc? wl ? ?iny question is raised as to the spirit and the methods of Mr. Lemuel Ely gg*g great municipal campaign. The com? pilation throws light?which may or may not be needed-upon the cause? which led to the dis? comfiture of the Platt-Qulgg Rump and the needless and disgraceful def.-nt of tha party they assumed to lead. Som?? of the comments upon this publication have already been printed In The Tribune. They agree in tenor and spirit with the letters received In this office from the editors of newspapers to Whom the pamphlet was sent. The general SX] reaslOB is one of dis? gust, mingled with amnr.ement. at the fatuous folly which inspired su.-h a publication. vTe now "observe with Interest, though not with surprise," that "The New-York Sun" Itself has become ?ware of the effect of the compilation from Its own pages upon the press of this city .ind State.

The great bnlr.nce due this ?'ountry on mer? chandise account must somehow b?? patti, hut howl It is large enough t.. make tbe question interesting, ?clgures alresdj published Indicate that it la not far from $231,000 100 in four months since the new tcrjll' treni Into effect. Against t! is may be reckooed perhaps 115,000 ???? net excess of gold Importa Including those at San Francisco not yel fully ?sported, over exports of silver Bui the balance till] exceeds 1210,000,000, and is aoi Octitloualy Infla ed, sa it was In recent years, by exceptionally great underviiiiatioii of Importa.

This would ?till leave !*'-,<h'>,<>(i0.i>o?> to he paid, and It becomes | curious question how payment is to be made. Lending finuucicrs, Mich as Mr. J. P.

The members of th?? Commission had been select? ed, he said, with a view to their fitness. He mod? estly refused to say anything about himself or why h? had been named the first on the list, but It Is well known that Colonel Phl.-'.rerer has been the motive power of the Adjutant-General's or? nee for years nnd that he belongs by right In that position. Ilia views have appeared through several admlnlatrattons over the signature? of adjutanti general who would have been helpless without his assista????. As to the other members he said: "Colonel Apple. t??a Is an officer of acknowledged ability, at the head of a model regiment, and h'.s views on mat? ters which will come up for discussion will be most valuable. "Major Roe'a long experience In the Army and his ?ffleient work in the -\avalry braneh of the State ser?'lee were good reasons for his selection. Colonel ? Butt represents the younger element In the Na? ti ?ral Guard, and was probably selected in Tfon nltion of the high standard attained by the 12th ?.'?-iment under his eommand. Colonel Welch, of the fi?th ?? Riment, represents the Fourth Brigade. Ile s an cfiieer of wid? exiericnee. he commar.de a Kood organization, and will be a valuable member of the I ,rly. "Colonel He Forest, of Brooklyn, hae been la ths Guard about twenty-flve year?, and Is looked upon as a painstaking, competent ohVer. Tears of ser vii-e in the Jiidg^Advocat?'?

O-.Ionel Phlsterer said that the Commission would meet for organization in one of the Adjutant-Gen? ?ral'S room, in the Capitol, on Monday, but that after a prmar.er.t organization had been effected the piace of meetiu would in all probabi.lty be re rr.ov.-d to New-Yoik. i.ecauie mo? of tne members are residents of the greater city.
