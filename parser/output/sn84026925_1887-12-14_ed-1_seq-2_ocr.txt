JTitraps and ? The women politicians of the count/y, according to Mrs. Belva Lock wood, are now preparing for the most vigorous campaign of the protracted war for universal suffrage. Efforts are being made to effect a coalition of the various factions striving for the common end. ? Bradstreet's report of last Friday estimates the cotton crop at 6,480,000 bales, or 180,000 bales more than the last estimate of the agricultural department. If the crop should amount to 6,500,000 bales, the i increased demand of the world would consume it at fair prices. Therefore, let no one feel unduly uneasy about the situation. ?The New York apple crop this year is enormous. The crop is estimated at 2,500,000 to 8,000,000 barrels. This does not include the large amount used in cider mills, evaporators and canning factories. Over 1,000,000 barrels will be shipped to Europe, the State being full of Glasgow, Liverpool and Austrian buyers. ? Reports from the Southern cotton mills show an important improvement, the consumption of cotton having increased 12,000 bales, or nearly 6J per cent, in the last six months. In the last three months thirty-two cotton factories have been established in fte South. What is nf +1-1Q nmrlliot.4 ftt 11)686 COt IUVIV) UiOUjr VA VUV ton mills are finding their way into foreign markets. ?The commissioner of labor statistics for North Carolina says that there are 80 cotton factories in that State representing invested capital to the amount of $4,000,000. The total number of spindles run is 200,000 and they consume annually 30,000,000 pounds of cotton. The aggregate of the cotton crop of the State is about 400,000 bales. So it appears that one-fifth of the North Carolina crop is consumed by the mills of that State. ?In the House of Delegates of the Virginia Legislature last Thursday, a joint resolution was adopted?90 to 1?directing the Virginia Senators and requesting her representatives in Congress to use their beat efforts to secure the repeal of the internal revenue system of taxation, and failing in that, to secure, if possible, the repeal of so much of the system as imposes a tax on tobacco in any of its forms, and upon spirits distilled from fruit, y ?The revenues of the Government from /Ntll sources aggregated $30,500,000 in the month of November. This was an income of one million a day, yet the amount paid - * ?- '-J VirrVit. out neany equaieu me icra^io. een millions was paid out for pensions. While the public debt increased nearly a million, it is fortunate that this heavy drain does not continue uniformly throughoat the months of the year. The month of November is always signalized by heavy disbursements to pensioners. ?There is a very general impression that President Cleveland is a fat man. Says a correspondent: "As a matter of fact he is not fat, although he is stout. His flesh is remarkably Arm and his muscles are remarkably strong, while his bones are large and well knit. The result is that he carries himself with more ease, grace and dignity than most men of half his size, and suffers very little of the inconvenience over which fat men as large as he is are constantly groaning." ? The Atlanta city election last Thursday hinged upon the Prohibiten question. The Antis had out a straight ticket, while the Prohibitionists ran a combination ticket. The election was warmly contested and resulted in a victory for the Antis, their average majority being 1,000. This gives the Antis complete control of the city. The commissioners of Fulton county have fixed the wholesale licenses in the county at $1,600. Their right to do so is contested. The retail licenses will be issued in January. ?No small sensation has been caused in Atlanta by the failure of the new city council to re-elect United States Senator Joseph E. Brown as a member of the hoard of education. It was currently admitted that an organized effort would be made to defeat him, and the fact of his prominent connection with the anti-prohibition clan issaid to have been used to his disadvantage. The Senator has always been considered invincible in politics, and to be denied re-election to the honorary office named, is regarded by his friends as an undeserved slight. It is claimed to have been due to an oversight. ? The General Christian Conference, "under the auspices and direction of the Evangelical Alliance for the United States, of which Wm. E. Dodge, of New York, is president, and Rev. Dr. Josiah Strong, of New York, is general secretary, was in session in Washington last week. On Friday afternoon about 2,000 members of the Alliance called at the White House to pay their respects to President and Mrs. Cleveland. The Rev. Dr. Burchard, of New York, (of "Three Rs." fame) was among those presented. The President recognizr ed him at once, and advancing toward him said, with considerable earnestness and fervor, that he was very glad to see him, whereupon the crowd of delegates broke into hearty laughter. "V ?Speaking of celestial phenomenon, an / exchange says: The Star of Bethlehem, which has always borne part in rhyme and story with the birth of Christ, and which for a long time was regarded by many as purely mythical, is, after an absence of 315 years, visible in the eastern skies between 4 A. M. and daylight. That this is the veritable star so often referred to admits of no doubt, for the astronomers say that it makes its appearance once !n every 314 or 315 years. Taking the average of 314$ years and multiplying by six, the result is 1887, the exact numberof years since the birth of Christ. This proof is absolute and admits of no denial. To the naked, eye the star appears to be about UUC eiguui HIC SiZ,C Ul HIC lUUUU. jlio J/U3Ition is about east by south. ? It looks now as though the proposition to open a portion of the Indian Territory to settlement would receive stronger support in the Fiftieth Congress than it ever has secured hitherto. This is partly due to the fact that several lines of railroads are under construction through the Territory, under grants by Congress, while others are in prospect. But a still more potent influence is that, if allotments are to be made under the Severalty Act to those tribes in the Territory who are not specially exempt from its operations, something will have to be done eventually with the very large surplus of their lands. Hence it may be deemed well to concentrate beforehand all the Indians, as Commissioner Atkins advises, in the eastern part of the Territory, instead of planting a settlement of whites in the heart of the Territory, with Indians on both sides, as the Oklahoma project proposes. Gen. Sheridan, in his report, also counsels prompt action. ? The superintendent of the dead letter bureau, with the approyal of the postmaster general, has prepared a circular letter which will be sent shortly to all postmasters, directing the enforcement of section 590 of the postal laws and regulations. This section makes it imperative upon postmasters to advertise in a newspaper or post a manuscript list of non-delivered letters. It also requires the charge and collection of 1 cent in all cases when a letter has been published in a newspaper, either gratuitously or at 1 cent for each letter or a less sum, or whether the publication was merely Dy a written nsu posieu m some pubilc place. In all cases the postmaster is directed to affix and cancel a 1-cent "postage due" stamp as evidence of its delivery. In postoffices other than those of the free-delivery class, the "postage due" stamp should not be affixed until the letter is delivered. This clause of the postal laws, it is said, has not hitherto been strictly enforced. ? A Philadelphia dispatch of Sunday says: The new high license law passed by the last Legislature promises to drive out of the liquor business not only those who cannot afford to pay a $500 license fee, but also many wealthy dealers who will find it impossible to secure the necessary bondsmen to become responsible for their faithful compliance with the law. Up to the close of business yesterday only 350 applications for licenses for the next year nad been filed with the clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions. This is considered a small number in view of the fact that there are about 0,000 saloons in the city. Deal ers are experiencing no end of trouble in obtaining two bondsmen who are willing to take upon themselves the responsibility attached to those who become sureties for tavern keepers. Such bondsmen will each become responsible in the sum of $2,000 for the paymentof all fines, penalties or damages that may be levied upon the dealer for any violation of the laws governing the sale of liquor. In attaching their name to the bond, sureties also give a power of attorney to the district attorney to confess judgment in the sum named for the recovery of all damages, costs, fines and penatties, &c.

YORKVILLE. S. C. 4. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14,1887. A STATE OFFICER RESIGNS. Hon. W. E. Stoney, Comptroller-General of this State, has tendered his resignation to the Governor, to take effect on the oonti inofant nr snnn thereafter as his successor may be prepaid to take charge of the department. Mr. Stoney has held the office for the past seven years, having been three times elected by the popular vote without opposition. His present term expires one year hence. He resigns for the purpose of accepting the position of auditor of the South Carolina Railroad. The resignation has been accepted by the Governor, who made it the subject of a special message to the Legislature last Saturday. The 22nd instant has been appointed as the day for the election of his successor by a joint ballot of the Legislature. The most prominent candidates mentioned for the position are I. N. Withers, of Fairfield ; J..S. Verner, of Oconee; J. C. Coit, of Chesterfield; and John P. Thomas and W. J. Laval, of Columbia. 

PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS. The President having nominated Secretary Lamar for Senatorial confirmation as Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, the following changes in the cabinet were made: William F. Vilas, of Wisconsin, secretary of the interior. D. M. Dickinson, of Michigan, postmaster general. Charles S. Fairchild, of New York, secretary of the treasury. With the above the following nominations were also sent to the Senate: George L. Rives, of New York, assistant secretary of State. Isaac H. Maynard, of New York, assistant secretary of the treasury. Sigourn|y Butler, of Massachusetts, second comptroller of the treasury. James W. Hyatt, of Connecticut, treasurer of the United States. The Senate has not yet acted upon the nominations. but it is thouerht there will be no formidable opposition to them. Public interest is directed mainly to the fate of Lamar's nomination to the Supreme Court bench. 

STATE BAR ASSOCIATION. The annual meeting of the State Bar .Association was held in Columbia on Thursday last. The annual oration was delivered by Hon. Joel Prentice Bishop, the distinguished legal author of Cambridge, Mass. His subject was, "The common law as a system of reasoning, how and why essential to good government; what its perils and how averted." The discourse was a masterly one, and was listened to with rapt attention by the large audience, which was composed of the Federal and State judiciary, members of the bar and the General Assembly, the faculty of the University and many ladies. Essays were read by Edward McCrady, Jr., of Charleston ; James Aldrich, of Aiken; and C. E. Spencer, of Yorkville. Mr. Spencer's essay was upon "Case LawIs it an Evil ?" He maintained that it isan evil?an evil only so far as it tends to make case-lawyers, case-judges and case-text writers. It is not of the lex scripfa, for it comes to us in the form of reports of judicial decisions from every part of the United States. Nor is it of the lex non scripta. The uiuigcr ui utruumiug ucjjcuucni. ujxuij vu^clavv is greater with lawyers than with judges. It ought not to be followed in the sense of following a precedent. The danger from case-law to the lawyers is twofold?when it is relied on as one of the regular sources of information; again it greatly diminishes fondness and aptitude for general study. There should be more of an oral presentation and argument. In conclusion, he said that the fraternity should assume as its birthright the position which the fathers and sages of the profession in our State have bequeathed, as equal in all things to those of the first State bar in our great common country. IMPORTANT DECISION. The Supreme Court of the United States rendered a decision last week which scores a decisive victory of substantial value for the cause of prohibition. The cases under review came up from Kansas and involved the validity of the prohibition law of that State. The Supreme Court decided in favor of the State, Justice Harlan delivering the opinion. The Court said that the cases came up under the laws of Kansas, declaring the maintenance of a building for the manufacture or sale of liquor to be a nuisance, and making the manufacture or sale of intoxicants a misdemeanor. It was contended that this law was unconstitutional because it abridges the rights of citizens, and deprived a citizen of property without due process of law, a building used as a brewery being of little value for any other purpose. Justice Harlan said that it had been held repeatedly that the right of a State to regulate the sale of liquor did not invade the constitutional rights of citizens. It was contended, however, he said, that no State Legislature had the right to prohibit any person from manufacturing liquor for his own use or for export, for the reason that it was an invasion of the personal liberty inherent in citizens. It must be observed, however, he said, that the right to manufacture drink for one's own use is subject to the restriction that it shall not injuriously affect the public. The right to determine what was injurious had to exist somewhere, and the right of determining what measures were necessary for the preservation of the public morals, health and safety, had therefore been vested in the States by the constitutional right given them under the police power to regulate their own internal concerns. While this police power could not be abused and must only be exercised for objeets of real merit, this Court would certainly not say that the liquor traffic was not one which a State could lawfully prohibit, because it was well known that the abuse of intoxicants was productive of pauperism and crime. The next ground of contention, the Justice said, was that as the breweries had been erected prior to the passage of the prohibition law. and as they were of little use except for breweries, their property was taken without due process of law in violation of the Constitution, but all property under our form of government, he held, is subject to the obligation that it shall not be used so as to injuriously affect the rights of the community and thereby become a nuisance. The State of Kansas had prohibited the liquor j r traffic. It did not thereby take away the i property of the breweries. It simply i abated a nuisance. The property is not i taken away from its owners. They are i 1 only prohibited from using it for the spe- a cific purpose which the Legislature de- f clared to be injurious to the community. At Topeka, last Saturday, Judge Brew- ? er, of the U. S.. Circuit Court, issued a k decree declaring the Waleruff brewery ? of Lawrence a common nuisance and di- v rectingthe United States marshal to shut c it un and abate the same. The decree also t perpetually enjoins the brewery from r manufacturing or selling any intoxicating ( liquors. This is the first brewery that has t; been declared a nuisance under the pro- r hibitory law of Kansas, and the decree is ? in accordance with above decision. t r CONGRESS. [ The Senate was in session last Monday, ' and adopted the list of committees agreed ^ upon in Republican caucus. South Caro- r Una is represented on the committees as follows: To examine the several branches r of the civil service, epidemic diseases, ^ military affairs?Hampton ; naval affairsButler. p A large number of bills, resolutions and v petitions were introduced in the Senate i on Monday, among them a resolution by 1 Butler, which was adopted, authorizing I the appointment of a committee of five j Senators to consider the question of postal t telegraphy. f In the House, Mr. Springer, of Illinois, ? presented the petition of O. G. Chase, who claims to be a delegate from the territory * of Cimeron, known as the Public Land c Strip, and offered a resolution referring the t petition to the Territorial Committee when t appointed, and, in the meantime accord- j ing the floor privileges to Mr. Chase. Af- j ter discussion the resolution and petition ( were tabled. i Speaker Carlisle called Mr. Crisp, of Georgia, to the chair and stepped down j upon the floor where he addressed the 1 House as follows: "It is well known that ^ there is a contest pending which makes it j mo QQ r,rocir?iniy nftieer of the lllipivp^l 1V1 UJVj MU Plouse, to appoint the Committee on Elec- 1 tions. I have left the chair, therefore, for the purpose of asking the House to excuse me from the performance of that duty, and take such proceedings in this matter as ybur judgment may dictate. I have no suggestions to make except to say that the formation of the other committees of the House will be facilitated by having this matter disposed of at the earliest day that will suit the convenience of the members." A resolution was then offered by Mr. Holman and adopted, that the House, at 1 o'clock on Tuesday, proceed to elect fifteen members who will constitute the committee on elections. HOW THEY STAND. Immediately after the publication of the President's message, the New York World sent a numberof its reporters to Washington to interview Congressmen on that document and topics connected therewith. The following questions were put to the Senators and Representatives: For Republicans?1. Are you in favor of the norninatiou of Mr. Blaine for President? 2. If not, will you state your preference as to the candidate? 3. Do you favor the President's tariff ideas ? 4. How far would you be willing to go in any reduction of taxation? For Democrats?I.

To the questions above propounded, Sertator Butler said: 1. President Cleveland's message gives a most able solution of the tariff problem. Every Democrat in the South will endorse : it and every citizen of the South ought to do so. 2. For a reply to this question I refer you to the message itself. Representatives Dibble and Hemphill were interviewed and gave the following replies to the questions: Samuel Dibble?1. As I understand the message, the President wishes to express himself emphatically that, in his opinion, the reduction of the revenue is the absorbing issue before the country. I agree with him in that, and would go as far in the reduction of taxes as would bring the revenues and expenses on. an equality. 2. I believe in taxing the people sufficiently to carry on the government. J. J. Hemphill?1. I concur fn his views. 2. I think we ought to reduce the taxation by reducing the tariff, so as to be relieved of the surplus, and not touch the internal revenue if it can be avoided.

LETTER FROM COLUMBIA. Columbia, December 12.?There has been an unusually large amount of work done by the Legislature the past week, and the prospects are good that all necessary business will be transacted in time for us to adjourn before the holidays, without the usual all night rush and confusion; at least we hope so. None of the important measures introduced have received their final reading yet. Some have been rejected. One among them was a bill introduced by Dav export, of Greenville, to prohibit the working of children under 12 years of age in factories. The argument used in its favor was the injury to health and that it prevented such children from going to school. To me there seemed, under our social conditions, to be nothing in these arguments. In the first place, in a majority of instances, the children operatives in the factories are better clad and protected from the inclemency of the weather and have the means to buy better food and secure med- c ical attention, than those children outside without means except the labor of their hands. These advantages more than counteract whatever effect confinement may have upon the health of these children operatives. As to its depriving them of c school training, I think it ill becomes a' r State to interfere with the rights of any of i its citizens upon the plea that it is the du- t ty of parents to send their children to t school, when our free public schools are so 2 imperieci ana inemcieni. > This is the crying evil of the day?the i want of education among the masses of the g people. You may talk as much you please g about the necessity for legislation to en- c force the punishment of crime, to perfect ^ the jury system, to prohibit the sale of c whisky and the many social evils of which r we hear so much, and it all amounts to i very little when you get it. Legislative c fiats do not cure these evils. If public r sentiment does not oppose crime, juries will not convict. If public sentiment is g not opposed to rum selling, will juries 1 convict? No. If we ever expect to ar- i rive at that state of civilization in which c crime is reduced to the minimum, and t norals and religion are at the maximum v joint that may be consistent with human r mperfection9, we must, by every means 11 n our power, increase our educational u acilities, both by providing the means i o ind by taking an interest in perfecting our c ree public schools. , I It will be a grand and glorious day for : >ur country when every child of the Anglo I Saxon race upon its soil shall have the v >pportunity to obtain at least an elemen- s ary education. Then, and not until then, 1 c vill public sentiment be educated, and an j d nlightened public conscience bring about he social and political reforms we so much v leed. f The legislation of a country and the ad- s ninistration of the government in its juliciary and all other branches will never 1 ise higher than its source?the people, j So let us elevate the source by educating | t he poor children who are to form the o najority that will govern our State in the k uture.

If it was a violation of law in his State to be an organizer or a member if the order of Knights of Labor, I would nsure his conviction, by the most credible vitnesses in our town, for one half the fees ie has received for organizing lodges of Gnights of Labor.

I believe the Act, making Black's a grad:d school district, introduced at this siting of the legislature, and which will loubtless become a law, meets with universal approbation among our people. It s evidently a wise and commendable dejarture from the old system of public ichools, and any intelligent people wiH idopt it, who advocate economy and utiliy, and believe in the general education tnd enlightenment of their children, ifour contributor, "Education," has ce'rainly given this subject mature and logical consideration. His article should be ead by every one. Several parties have applied to W. D. 2amp, trial justice, for warrants for the irrest of persons guilty of petty larceny, daving no jurisdiction to try parties accused of larceny, and disfavoring the idea >f incurring the expense on the county atending commitments to the county jail, he prosecutions have been put off, awaitng the action of the legislature. This aw should be amended imtanter. A. D. Hardin, agent of the Richmond tnd Danville Railroad at this agency, has >een transferred to Cornelia, Ga. Mr. lames, of Spartanburg, will succeed him.

The tabulated statement of the State Board of Railroad Commissioners of the earnings of Ol the railroads of this State for October last, as = compared with the same month last year, was furnished to the daily papers last Saturday. Of twenty-one roads included, sixteen show an ~ increase of 888,743.70, and five a decrease of 818,998.21, a net increase of 809,745.49, or 9.8726 percent. The five roads showiug a decrease ai are the Port Royal and Augusta, the North- ^ eastern, the Laurens, the Columbia and Greenville and the Charleston and Savannah. Of U] those showing an increase, the Atlanta and ss Charlotte Air Line ranks the first, with 830,- ^ 852.99; the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta next, with 815,643.55, and the Wilmington, A Columbia and Augusta next, with 87,912.08. . The net per cent, increase of roads in the Richmond and Danville system is 18.53. The earnings of the Chester and Lenoir _ Railroad wero 87,673.74 as compared with ? 86,075.44 for October, 1886, showing an increase of 8998.20, or 14.95 per cent. The total passenger earnings of all the roads reporting for October, 1886, were 8163,594.76; . for 1887, 8202,228.77; increase, 83%634.01 or 23.61 per cent. The total freight earnings for the month were P* in 1880. 8497.001.50; 1887. 8527.046.82; increase, ?30,045.32 or 6.04 per cent. lE . st SUICIDE. d( Between 1 and 2 o'clock this morning, Charles ar Breitz, a boarder at the Owen House, in this m place, either fell or jumped from a window of ec the third story to the pavement below, receiving oj injuries from which he died at 3 o'clock. He it, was undoubtedly laboring under the effects of drink, having had an attack of delirium tre- Oi mens Monday night, but on last night was sup- vt posed to be quiet. At the time above named, in Mr. Lewis, whose room adjoins that occupied or by Mr. Breitz in the north-west corner of the building, was attracted by a noise to Breitz' in room. When he entered he found no one, but gc saw that the window was raised. Surmising a bl catastrophe he hastened down to the pavement It where he found Breitz in a semi-conscious to condition, sitting on his knees. With the th assistance of Mr. Lewis and one or two others whom Mr. Lewis called to his aid, Breitz re- ofl turned to his room and Dr. White was imme- pc diately summoned, and Dr. Gorton, Breitz' th employer, was notified of the occurrence. yt Breitz never spoke coherently after being as taken to his room. He only said in explana- th tion of the affair that he had been thrown by a of mule. He sustained no external injuries ex- ne cept a slight bruise on the right leg below the A kneo. It was soon apparent, however, that ho he was seriously injured internally and death loi ! ended his pain at 3 o'clock. From the posi- ne tion of the sash it is not thought that he jump- th ed deliberately from the window, but by some m means fell from it. ne Mr. Breitz was from Salem, X. C., a black- It smith by trade, and employed by Griffin A be Gorton on their railroad work. He was about w< 25 or 30 years of age and unmarried. He was ' neatly arrayed for the grave, and Dr. Gorton is ne awaiting instructions from his parents at Sa- ev lem as to the disposition of the body. in RAILROAD NOTES. gj A ride over the work covered by Griffin A w Gorton's contract, reveals the fact that these contractors are making rapid progress. Their heaviest work now is the deep cut in Latta's ^ field, south of town, and on this they are em- W} ploying all necessary appliances for moving ? 441 dirt rapidly. All their work, except a snort distance at the extreme western end, is opened I9 out, and a good portion of the roadbed on their section is ready for the crossties. dis Mr. Ross, to the east of Griffin & Gorton, and Cc Smith it Lathrop to the west, are also progress- ly ing well. We are informed that Smith & i01 Lathrop are now working the largest force of tri any contractors on the line. Roddey <fc Whit- ?'! nor, below Rock Hill, are also reported to have a heavy force, and to be making rapid progress ? with their work, as also is Capt. M. C. Lewisl^^__ the trestle builder. His force is now concen- ? tratcd at King's Creek, at which point will be the highest trestle between Black's and Cam- th den. From the present progress of the work J. it is safe to say that the track-laying will not be delayed between Catawba River and Black's. co Mr. McCormick, the skillful draughtsman y< of the company, passed through town yester- R< day on a recreating ride to the upper portion CI of the line, never having been on the line j C1 more than a mile west of Yorkville. He will , ? have the opportunity of seeing some tall trestles, the pictures of which he drew before they rz wore built. Mr. Ed. Hart, a member of Capt. Ramsaur's M gineering corps, returned the other day from > mountains of North Carolina. He informs that C'apt. Ram.saur has completed a perinent location of the line between Rutherdton and Marion, a distance of twenty-live les. )uring a part of last week, Col. Johnson, aeral manager, and Major Hart, attorney for > Massachusetts and Southern Construction mpany, were in Augusta, Ga., perfecting the al arrangements for the transfer of the Geori and Carolina Midland, and its consolidan with the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chi*o line, to be known as the Augusta Divis1. Though Major Hart was called back to igusta on Monday, he informed us on Satury that every arrangement had been perfected d payments made for the transfer and conidation, and that work on this division will mmeuco at an early day. A portion of the e between Augusta and Newberry has al idy been graaeu ior a narrow-gauge iruvK. ie first work will be to change and adapt this rtion of the line to a broad gauge track. To izens of' Augusta and interyiewers for the ess, the officials of the C., C. >k C., gave the formation" that the Augusta Division will tersect the trunk line at some point between >rkville and Shelby.
