IT is A wise provision that, we have our Thanksgiving first, and congress afterwards. MR. SCHLATTER, it may be suggested, might do a wholesale business in Ar­ menia iibout this time, at a fair profit. AT latest reports, the procession of Colonel Ingersoll in the direction of the mourner's bench was proceeding quite slowlv. AND as for Brother T. B. Reed for speaker, we are forced to that same, stereotyped and old expression that "he's all right." IT should not be forgotten, either, that the $100,000 which Margaret Mather Pabst is to receive involves the profit on several million bottles of beer. OK COURSE, Mr. Reed makes an ex­ cellent speaker, but the presidency, you know, involves other qualifications, which, I might say without prejudice, etc.—W. McKinley. THE Mandan Pioneer says there were no fuss and feathers in the observ­ ance of Thanksgiving day in Mandan. Perhaps, however, the Morton county turkeys don't have any feathers. AND the Valley City Times-Record suggests that Jamestown, having passed the curfew ordinance, should appoint some old woman to act as official spanker, and administer punishment for a viola­ tion of the ordinance. WESTERN WOMANHOOD, the monthly magazine published by Miss Bates, will be removed it is said, to Fargo, instead of Bismarck, and will become the offi­ cial organ of the Equal Suffrage associa­ tion, recently organized at Grand Forks, as well as of the state W. C. T. U. With a society organized, and an official organ established, who is to say now that woman's suffrage shall not mate­ rially advance? ANOTHER severe loss to the literary world is in the death of Alexander Dumas,|the brilliant French novelist. Dumas is probably best known to the world through his Count of Monte Cristo, which has probably been more widely read than any other of his works.. Dumas was a combination of French and African, his grand father having been a full blooded negro. The dead novelist was born in 1824. IF any one doubts that the Wilson Gorman tariff is a tariff for the benefit of foreigners only he should study our foreign exchanges. The Paris! news­ papers are gloating over the French budget which reports that "the exports of France have increased 195,000,000 francs in the first quarter of 1895, owing to the operations of the Wilson-Gorman, tariff bill and to resumption of commer­ cial relations with Switzerland. THE Drayton Echo says it knows posi­ tively that the wheat transactions of ex-Governor Burke the past season have reached $1,500,000, and says "this shows conclusively that ex-Governor Burke is leading the grain men of Minneapolis and Duluth in the volume of business transacted. The popularity of the gov­ ernor of North Dakota, and his strict honesty and integrity in dealing with the farmers of the northwest, have counted materially with the people, and his many friends in the state congratu­ late him on his great financial success at the heiid of the lakes." LAND COMMISSIONER PHIPPS of the Northern Pacific railroad in a recent in­ terview said that his department was doing all in its power to accomplish the settlement of its land along the line of the road, and proposes to make a special effort to induce immigration to North Dakota. He also said that there was a fair prospect of accomplishing a good deal in this direction soon. He stated that in the spring of 1894 when he took charge of this department, it was absolutely impossible to induce any one to consider the purchases of North Da­ kota lands, and the drouth of 1894 still further discouraged settlement. He has used every possible means to get settlers with fairly good results. This season's pale of Minnesota lands for settlement has been very large, and the inquiry for North Dakota lands has been growing ever since the crop of the present year. The company has been devoting special efforts to the colonization of Dunkards on Northern Pacific lands, and has now on tile a considerable number of ap­ plications from these people, who intend to move upon the lands next spring. 

RAILROAD COMMISSIONER KEYES calls attention to the fact that 150 carloads of fat stock have been shipped from Ellendale this season. There are also three cheese factories in operation and they have proved an unqualified success. They have paid their patrons an average price of twelve cents per pound for but­ ter fat, while the average quality of the home made butter would have averaged only about 8 cents at the local stores Dickey county is all right, according to Mr. Keyes, and the thistle and drouth and other unfavorable crop features of the past few years have brought about a diversity of industry which is repaying the farmers considerably more than ex­ clusive grain farming. THE gist of the 15,000 words of the president's message is that the country is in a devil of a fix. It is disappoint­ ing that the message is not clearer in its recommendations. While upon some questions of foreign relations the sug­ gestions are clear enough, the matter of most vital importance, the raising of the needed revenue, is left rather to specu­ lation. It is evident, however, that the president clings yet to his old free trade ideas, and will not admit the failure of the democratic policy as a revenue raiser. [It will be impossible for congress to pass tariff legislation with the presi- 

RIGID economy in public expenditures will be the republican program for this winter. Speaker Reed has impressed this necessity on a number of the oldest members whom he honors with his con­ fidence and with whom he finds time, notwithstanding the rush of callers, to consult with regarding matters not con­ nected with the personnel of the com­ mittees. This does not mean that a "cheeseparing" policy will be adopted, or that great public works now in pro­ cess of construction will be discontinued in order to reduce appropriation but it does mean that not a dollar will be ex­ pended unnecessarily. It means, too, that no money will be voted for new public buildings except where urgent necessity exist. It is also under­ stood to mean that the river and harbor committee will be so constituted as to ,v ful reorganization near future. dent of this apparent idea, andtheques- prognostications is to amuse, and that ti°n of the deficit will have to be bridged over as circumstances will best allow until such a time as a complete re­ publican policy can be inaugurated and carried out. IT IS remarked by a well known state paper that one of the great drawbacks to getting men of means and farm expe­ rience to take land here is the high rate of fare asked by the railroads for a trip to the state to look the country over. A man in northern Iowa can go to Texas or Mississippi and return on a land seeker's ticket for less than he can make the trip to North Dakota. A good many farmers regard the distance to be trav­ eled by the amount of railroad fare to pay. It is suggested that if a half rate was made by the Northern Pacific, Great Northern and Milwaukee for this pur­ pose, with proper precautions about it being abused by those not entitled to it, a great many more people would make the first trip to look for location. The Soo road is eaid to be doing this, and it is claimed over fifteen quarter sections have been sold from the list along that road in Barnes and Steele counties this fall.

This board selected a secretary, who is called the state engineer, whose first duty is to measure the flow of every tricts, bonds may be voted and taxes levied to pay the interest each year on these bonds. The last was the mooted question, and the decision of the court is received with satisfaction by the farmers of the state. THE latest rumors concerning Vene­ zuela and her dispute with Great Britain are by no means unexpected. It is said that President Crespo is seriously con­ sidering the possibility, perhaps the probability, of war. He has been can­ vassing the military strength of the re­ public, and finds it able to put a well equipped army of 100,000 men into the field. That would be ample to deal with

But to the masses he is plain Dave Hill, a poli­ tical boss and trickster, of whose in­ tegrity and earnestness they are in con­ siderable doubt.

In order to made comparisons between the upper Mississippi valley I and remote districts of the country, tables have been prepared by the weather officials for the North Dakota THE winter crop of politics is being sown in the twin city papers by string fiends in variouf parts of the state, district entire, the middle slope states, whose acute insights into the minds of upper Mississippi valley, south Atlantic the state's officials, are dated with equal and west gulf states, and it is shown facility from Grand Porks, Fargo, James-I that only in one section of the North town and Bismarck. About the only Dakota district was there an excess of tendency of these premature political the normal rainfall during the past ten years. In all of the territory covered by these tables there was a deficiency of rainfall during the year, the most strik­ ing shortage being shown in the middle slope and the west gulf states. The Ohio valley was also very short in rain­ fall during the period, but in the west gulf states the shortage registered from 36 to 90 inches. After examining the tables, Prof. Moore, the chief of the weather bureau, said: "These tables cover a period of ten years and show returns for six geographical districts, business like, and praiseworthy manner and four stations widely separated in which characterizes the official acts of each district the present state administration. AT Cleveland, Ohio, on Thursday, the prayers of 3,000 Christian Endeavorers ascended to the throne of grace for the con version of Col. Robert G. Ingersoll from agnosticism and infidelity to belief in orthodox Christianity. Added to these were the prayers of innumerable mem­ bers of the salvation ariiiy, many of whom will fortify their prayers with per­ sonal appeals to the skeptical Ingersoll. Whatever efficacy there may be in prayer, it is doubtful if the present gen­ eration will see any radical metamor­ phosis in the religious beliefs of the colonel. The prayers of the righteous, so it is said, avail much. But the as­ sembly of 3,000 Christain Endeavorers with a set purpose to pray long and lus­ tily for the salvation of Col. Ingersoll, is too much after the tom-tom methods of salvation adopted by the salvation army. It savors of the sensational, and the time which is thus employed could be put to better and more practical use, did each one of the 3,000 demote it to dis­ pensing practical chartity, whenever op­ portunity ofiered. This wholesale prayer meeting will serve to furnish Ingersoll with anew shaft of ridicule to let fly at his old enemy, the church, and will per­ haps render the colonel firmer in his present convictions. It yill be seen that there is a remarkable deficiency in all of the districts except the northwest corner of North Dakota and a small section in the northwestern portion of Minnesota. Out of twenty-four stations throughout the region covered, but three show an excess of rainfall above the average dur­ ing the entire ten years, and the most marked deficiency, considered from every standpoint, is that registered, in the west gulf and Ohio valley districts." AN interesting symposium of the thanksgiving proclamations of the gov­ ernors of all the states in the union is published by the Chicago Tribune. They are not protracted documents, any of them. The longest is that of Governor Mclntire of Colorado, the shortest that of Governor McConnell of Idaho, who uses but sixty-five words, although Gov­ ernor Brown of Maryland used but three more words than the Idaho executive. Governor McConnell's proclamation is interesting for more than its brevity. Besides the usual preamble that the pro­ clamation is made in conformity to cus­ tom, he adds: "And in accordance with Section 10, general provisions of the re­ vised statutes, I hereby proclaim," etc. Three of the governors, those of Ohio, Minnesota and South Dakota, use scrip­ tural quotations in their proclamations.
