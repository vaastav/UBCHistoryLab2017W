PAGE TWO THE RICHMOND PALLADIUM AND SUN -TELEGRAM, TUESDAY, DEC. 9, 1913 BOARD TO APPOINT COMPETENT MEN Signatures on Petitions Will Carry Little Weight With Commissioners. Competency and efficiency will be lh-3 standards employed by the county rommiRKlonprs in judging the fitness f t applicants for apointment to posi tions by tho board. The board has made it known that the number of sig natures on a petition for an appoint ment will carry but little weight. While here is no objection to any one filing a petition bearing the names of friends who would like to see him appointed, it will receive no more consideration than a formal applica tion without a long string of signa tures attached. The commissioners have issued the following statement in regard to the selection of men to fill the various ap pointive positions: "This board is desirous of making appointments which shall reflect cred it upon both the county and the offi cer appointed and within the limita tions of salaries paid and qualifications demanded it is determined that the most competent officials shall be ap pointed and in this the board desires the co-operation of all citizens." TWENTY-TWO STATES HAVE A RICHMOND Mail Clerks of This City and Richmond, Va., Keep Directories. Richmond the Quaker City is one of twenty-two Richmonds in the Unit ed States, ranks second in population and the mail clerks at the postofSce say It ranks first as a city among the Richmonds. Besides the twenty-two Richmonds there are nine other cities in the country which bear the name of Richmond with an appended name, such as Richmond Camp, Richmond Furnace, and of which there are two Riohmond Dale. So frequently do stenographers ad dress mall to the wrong Richmond, probably by force of habit, that the mall clerks In the office have become acquainted with the names of many of the leading business houses in other Richmonds. A Richmond (Va.) city directory is kept in the Richmond (Ind.) office, and a Richmond (Ind.) directory Is in the office at Richmond, Va. More mistakes are made in these two Rich monds than any other, althoug much Richmond (Ky.) mail comes here. The Virginia and Indiana Rich monds make regular exchanges of their mall packets. However the di rectories are used only to find bust nss houses. ( States that have Richmonds are Ar kansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mass achusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Miss ouri. New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Ore gon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tex. as, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. NOTICE. No hunting on the R. G. Leeds farm south of city.

HAAS RE-ELECTED STATE SECRETARY At the second day's session of the new Congress President Wilson read his annual message to both branches of the national legislature assembled together. The principal points covered in the message were the Mexican situation, the currency bill, the trusts, direct primaries, and the form of government for Alaska and the Philippines. Regarding Mexico he said that "there can be no prospect of peace until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority." The currency bill he said would be a great help to the farmers and that under it the farmers and the government would henceforth work together. He promised a special message in re gard to the regulation of the trusts, and said that the Sherman Law should stand as it is but said that he want ed "more explicit legislation" to reduce the debatable points. He urged the prompt enactment of legislation providing for the direct primaries so the voters can choose their own nominees for the Presidency. Independence for Hawaii and the Philippines and a full territorial form of government for Alaska are his ideas on these subjects.
