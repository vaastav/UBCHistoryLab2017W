' He has announced his determination to sup port the republican party in the first place and President Arthur in the second; especi ally Arthur.' , '.' It is good of David to turn republican in his old age; but it is wonder fujl how many people have made up their minds that the Arthur Administration needs a hearty and firm support, and how readily Arthur acq ui sees in that view. To be sure he never seemed to think that the Garfield Administration should be support ed but then he is a stalwart. ' Can it be that those hundred thousand offices makes any difference?. '"The long expected message has come, and its principle ' characteristic seems to be length; in that it is preeminent, con taining in all .about 17,200 words. : In treating of oar foreign relations it is con, gratnlatory to an extent that inspires ns with the belief that we are a community of Quakers, and quarrels and strife are foreign to our natures; our standing; with ! the outside world is represented' as being inost pacific; and no desire to ' knock a chip on anyone's ihoulder is displayed. , The Panama canal case is . treated ex h'austively, and the necessity of the United States having full control of that territory is insisted upon. The logic , of this, de mand is too apparent to require argument, and Americans all will unite in seconding the government in this stand. ' ' The international difficulties into which the republics of South America are now plunged are commented on, and the Presi dent takes the ground that this country should act as a local peace-maker. Our relations with the Chinese and Japanese governments are commented on, although one looks in vain for anything like an opinion as to the manner in which the Chinese in this country should be dealt with. " On financial matters. President Arthur . has made up his mind that we are getting rich altogether too fast, and consequently advocates a reduction of taxation. He is desirous that the internal revenue be de creased, and rightly, if a reduction of re ceipts are what he wishes, that there be no reduction in the duties on Imports, j In speaking of the tariff, his " caution shows itself, and while on the one hand he thinks, perhaps, some change should be made, yet he thinks it had better be made with caution; and he is fearful some Inter ests might suffer, and bo on, until one is lost in a maze of bewilderment as to -what he does mean. ; ' J s,... ; . On the subject of polygamy he comes to the point, and advocates strong and deter mined legislation against that eviL There I is some ring to his utterances pa that point, land it is to be hooed that somethinff more than talk will grow out of , it j Utah, in its present condition, ia a standing reproach to the civilization of ur country. ! s f - In treating of the' pension ofUce, he Is non-committal, but enough Is said to show that he full j recognizes what a fraud the thing is at present. - ' " The President devotes considerable space to civil service reform. and is prolific in suggestions; but when one thinks of the previous history of Arthur; and his late ac- "ns m V irginia. one 13 tefflptetl to style his professions "& noise, - and after, that, nothing'' I; -l.Mi-H,: i:i'Vi',jv 'ivj,. The matter of our " carrvine trade is discussed in a particularly weak manner. Attention is called to the fact that while exports and imports have , been steadilv increasing ; the " number of American ships 1 has' as stead ijy diminished. 'There moat be aome pe- culiar iindraace ; to fte development of this iniustrj" says the message jfcid no one Will .4ay &u nap & a& t atement ; but when he proposes to remedy it by more proleetioaVhe "TiiBg - grows "ridieulouSi Protection ia what has KilleiLoft the roce 04 Amerioaa sbfp 'oVners md 4 moro'- Wtee tion would be like putting oil on the flamea," ", r'.'7 ' :The' matter t,l presidential eteciioni ' is next coramcn ted pn, and "finally ; Congress ia asked te determine the question so mach discussed a short time ago as ; t6 I what is meant by temporary inability,;. '. ' '. ' v A means of getting rid of mutilated cur rency has been discovered ia the St. Louis churches where ihe coins are dropped in the. Collector's box. Prominent ministers there are reported as saying that the, effort to pass mutilated money has been produc tive of more profit to the " church than when, all sorts of bric-a brae was passable. A. man now, who holds a punched half-dol-lar after essaying to pass it off for mer chandise and t)eing unsuccessful, finally resorts to the collection box," and, with the shortsightedness peculiar to .roguery,, he drops a half dollar or . a; quarter where formerly a nickel or a dime sufficed. 1 The money, when it accumulates, is 'sent to the Uniied jStates mint,, where it is re ceived and paid for as bullion, , entailing a loss of five per cent. : . . . ' i "The President's message was probably sent to the j" Capitol to-dayp We could print to day a synopsis of it but prefer " to wait till we " can present it in full. We have every reason to believe, that", we can send it put as a supplement." . , ; Bo says the Mdline Dispatch, and it is about as cheeky a statement as that jour nal could wellmake. : 'We could print to day a synopsis' is rather a bold statement, as the first knowledge-the Bitpateh could possibly obtain of it was published in Tint Argus of last evening, and as to profess lag to wait to send it out as a supplement, that supplement will be obtained from the Union. The DiepaieA is unable to print and news until a day after .The Akgtts, and the Uniwh&s had it, as it well knows, and such pretense is fooli&h. : : Arthut has shown that he ia capable Of writing v a long message, if. hot a good one. ; i r- c v i 1 5.2 w-4?
