ft gpjW WEEKLY JOUHML-IBIiaL J. C Martin, Editor. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12. 1888. EDITORIAL NOTES. Silver and wool are both advancing in price. Congressman Vandever has introduced a bill to divide the state of California. Levi P. Morton, vice president elect, is interested in mining in this territory. Railread iron is quoted at $26 per tun as against $37.50 last yar at this time. The Tucson Citizen is booming Louis Wolfley's candidacy for appointment as governor, . . Chathanm, of tbe.Nogales Her ald, publishes one of the newsiest and spiciest papers in the territory. Phenix boasts of ripe oranges. There seems to be no limit to the agricultural possibilities of the Salt river valley. New Mexico has gained over 5,000 votes during the past two years, and expects to gain 10,000 within the next two. Senator Allison, of Iowa, denies the "leport t'nat he has been effered the secretaryship of the treasury by Harri son. Now that the democracy ia about to lose its grip on the country, its leaders talk of admitting a number of territories as states. As civilization advances slugging matches seem to grow in popular favor, There are now twenty prize ring exhibi tions to one a auaiter of a century ago That part of the president's message protesting against the return of the j Apaches to Arizona will meet with a j Hearty endorsement from all the citizens of this territory. Coogan, the labor candidate for mayor of New York, paid $100,000 for his po litical experience in the campaign. The sum looks somewhat large for a laboring man to squander. An exchange hopes that Mr. Harri son will have a broad enough southern policy to make it possible for negroes to ticket in the south if they want to do so. Grover Cleveland's message to con gress is at hand, published in the Albu querque Democrat. It is quite a lengthy document, occupying thirteen columns of space in that paper. It is officially announced that all ego tiations for the settlement of rahroad trouble west and southwest of Chicago have been broken off, and the great clearing house has fallen through. General Harrison is a Presbyterian and Levi P. Merton is a Congregation al ist. Mrs. Harrison was educated at Oxford, Ohio, and Mrs. Moiton re ceived her education at Vassar college. The ubiquitous Tascott, the murderer of Millionaire Snell, in Chicago, has been arrested again, this time in Ken tucky. It has not been over ten days since San Francisco detectives though they had the right man. Carl Schurz has returned from Ger many, after hearing of the election of Harrison and Morton. He is endeav ing like a large majority of Arizona mug wum s to convince the party that he has always been a stalwart republican. Prospector. A weather plant capable of predicting earthquakes Kists in Vienna. On sev eral occasions these predictions as to earthquakes' have been useful in ena bling mint owners to take precautions for preventing loss of life in colliery explosions. ' The New York World says that the country editors did more towards elect ing Harrison than was 'accomplished by the politicians, who will claim the credit, and thinks that a little of th Tom Huehes, of the Albuquerque Citizen, has recently enlarged that very able journal to seven columns to the w - r page. We are pleased to note this evi dence of the Citizen's prosperity, as there is not a harder working man in ten territories khan Mr. Hughes. In his annual message Grover Cleve land still adheres to his anti-silver policy. He says : 'The secretary recommends - the suspension of he further coinage of silver and in such recommendation I earnestly concur." He also sticks to his free trade doctrines. The following item is from the Fargo Republican : Dakota has a population of 600 000, Florida has 266,000. Dakota has 4,246 miles of railroad, Florida has .1,50 Dakota has 322 newspapers Florida has 102. Dakota paid for schools $2,000,000, Florida $33594S. A Maricopa county teamster shot a four-cent cartridge at a two-bit coyote, -which was standing near to a $700 lot et giant powder. The bullet struck the latter instead f the coyote, causing an explosion of the entire lot and more ef- fectuallv annihilating the animal than if k.. k. i..j.n mi;io I A party of prospectors who recently . . ,.

When a bill to "reg A few of the more advanced papers uJate tbe civil service" was before the and statesmen of the southern states the senate six years ag0a measure arc becoming tired of tbe shot gr.n pol- which was framed for the purpose of icy of disfranchising the negroes, and keeping republicans in office under a ' are now advocating an educational re- democratic administration Mr. Ingalls quiremeni lor ine ngm or suarage. This they consider would be equally as effective as the shot gun, and somewhat mere civilized. Mark Smith has gone back to Wash- Senator Kenna, of West Virginia, is ington. While having accomplished heartily disgusted with the result of the nothing for the territory during the past election in that state, and says it is due two years, it is to be hoped that our dele- to the fact that "the niggers arid sol gate has learned the congressional ropes diers all voted the republicanticket" sufficiently now to do something of a If Kenna had his way about it he would substantial nature it this territory. An I appropruti (m pnuding a territorial 1 capital building in Prescott, for instance, is one of the measures which Mr. Smith should secure. Speaking of Alaska in a recent lecture in Washington, Prof. J. W. Checkering said that the great obstacle to enjoying a summer there is the vast number of large and bloodthirsty mosquitoes. Dogs are killed by them and men preserve their lives only by covering their faces with thick cloths and wearing gloves. Congress should make an appropria tion for enlarging and improving the quarters at Whipple Barrack?. That post is the healthiest on the Pacific coast, while it possesses all other ad vantages for garrisoning a large number of troops. We hope that our new depart ment commander, Colonel B. H. Grier son, will recommend such an appropria tion. Tt would be amusing were it not so ridiculous, to see the interest manifested in th republican Dartv bv some demo- . ... w j I 0 m cratic papers. From the recommends tions, for appointments to office, that are being made by them one would be led to believe that they had worked for the success of the party. It will, however, rpnnirp n hptrar endorsement, than the recommendation of a democratic paper to secure an office under the next ad ministration. The interior department has notified the Cberkees,:that the Cherokee strip is the property of the United States and that the Indians have no right to lease it. The strip comprises 6,000,000 acres of crazing land. On Thursday the Cherokee legislative passed a bill leasing the strip to a stock syndicate at $200,000 yearly for five years. Principal Chief Mayo, has not yet signed the bilL A delegation will next week be sent to Washington to prove to the in terior department that the land belongs to the Cherokee nation. A statehood convention was held at Jamestown, Dakota, recently, at which resolutions were adopted favoring the division of Dakota territory on the sev enth parallel, and the immediate admission of the northern portion into : the union as North Dakota. In case the present congress fails to provide for admission, the president-elect is re quested to call a special session of con gress for the purpose, and that South Dakota, Montana and Washington are respectfully invited to co-operate. A committoe was chosen to arrange for an inter-territorial convention, which will probably be called at Helena, Montana. The United States grand Jury com pleted its labors and were discharged several days since, but up to the pres ent writing the report they made has not come to light. It is now, however, an open secret that several prominent citizens were indicted by it charged with cutting timber on government land, and others with perjury in connection with making final proofs on government land. These indictments have been secured through the administration's special agents and will no doubt be the subject of voluminous reports from them to the department at Washington. While not familiar with all the cases we are not able to express an opinion in regard to them in the aggragate, but we are sufficiently familiar with some to characterize them as an outrage. While doing bo, it may be added that the grand jury and court are net to blame in the matter, the testimony introduced being ex-parte entirely, of such a nature as to justify the action taken. Should these cases ever come to trial we Fin cerely believe that it will besdemon strated that the courts of justice have been made innocent instruments of per sonal persecution, for which the victims can obtain no redres. oti7tt3 a marked increase ot business in every branch of the postal service. The 1 - number of postoffices on July rst 1888 was 57i37 an increase of 6,124 hi three years, and of 2,219 for the last fiscal yeai. The latter mentioned increase is classified as follows : New England states 5 Middle states 181, Southern states and Indian Terri tory 1,406, the states and territories of the Pacific coast 190, and' ten states and territories of the west and north west 435, District of Columbia 2, total 2,219. Free delivery offices have in creased from 1S9 in the fiscal year end ed June 30th., 1887, to 35S in the year ended June 10th., iSSS. In the rail waV mail service there has been an in- creasein one year of 1 6S routes, and in the number of miles traveled per anum an increase from iso.tq!; to 017,411. The estimated increase of railroad service for the year 15600 miles, but the amount of new railroad service actually put On was Senator Ingalls, in a letter to the ed itor of the New York Independent; ex Presses lhe right sort of civil service doctrine when he said : 'If there will be more than forty thousand democrats 111 UUlbE UW Hit 111 KJl iUltlwll UCAt. about which I knownothinc, they should he rpmnvpH hcfnrf th oninor rlnn-n L the sun on tbat day, and n)ore thac f . .1 . , , , W 4Vf..M.t IVfUWIII-WllJ 

UUUV1UII.U opposed it, and warned his. repub lican colleagues that it was an inven tion that would return to plaguo them. probably disfranchise "the niggers and soldiers.' A BETTER MAIL SERVICE NEEDED. Citizens of Williamson valley com plain, and jubt.y too, of the lack of proper mail service. The .mail reaches there only once a -week and the sched ule is such, that it reouires about two weeks tor a letter, mailed at Prescott, to reach the valley and have an answer returned to Prescott. The citizens of that section including Walnut creek shouid have at least a tri-weetkly mail service. Williamson valley and Wal nut creek are not the only sections either where mail service is inadequate. Copper Basin and Congress City should ench have post offices and mail routes established to them. A daily null service from Phenix via the Black Canyon road and a tri weekly via Wickenburg, Stanton, Ante lope and Skull valleys, should be estab lished instead of the present, six time a week, three each way, service which is very unsatisfactory in every respect There is no reason why a great govern ment like ours should not provide h.r citizens who live on 1 he frontier, some thing approaching competent mail facilities when.it can afford to carry the letters and papers of people living in the great cities to their doors and deliver them into their hands. It would cost a little money, but if men and women are willing to deprive themselves of the comforts and luxuries of the older and more populous places and endure hard ship;, trials and inconveniences of the frontier, and develop the resources of the conntry, the government should :it least be willing to provide them with the means of hearing from the rest of the world at regular intervals. The policy established in the mail service of the territories of the west is parsimon ious in the extreme and is not a credit to our government. - An exchange speaking fromexperiem e says: "It is too often the mission of the country newspaper to do an immense amount of work for nothing, no thanks included ; to furnish thought for the thoughtless, brains for the brainless, gumption for the gumptionless, vim tor the vimless, aim for the aimless, and common sense suggestion for those who have no scose and simply echo other men's thoughts themselves. All this the average country nowspapcrs does and generally does it well. In campaigns their segregate influence is immense, and ui many states do more to control the election than the great city newspapers, home influence being linked to larger questions in all such campaigns. Heie and th re among these country news, papers is one whose editor has mistaken his mission, one who fires with a blunder-buss instead of a rifle, and who is him self a smooth bore of light calibre. But these art: exceptions. As a general thing the man is Keer than the niche in which fate has placed him a cannon fir ing away among pop guns, a whale fli -ping around among porpoises. For a real faithful, manly, conscientious and competent country newsoaper a commu nity should pay liberally and respond in cheers instead of grunts, groans and urn wis. Pnztt vou! vili.tce newspaper n w t ' if vou have a aood one." Wc endorse every line, word and st able of the following from the Nogah s Herald : "It is said that WcbsterStret t, of Phenix, wants to be district judge Street is a pretty good sort of a fellow but wishy-washy politically, having la bored for the democratic candidate fur de'legate to congress. A man who is wishy-washv in politics is fcf-neialiy wishy washy in other things . " Thu are other "wichy-washy" politiciai boboing up serenely for appointment men who remained itride the politic fence, or ac Tn?nV"Hrd Htlfl '""t'tonanciJ 1 jurty uunng wit: recent election, out, I 1 1 . q - I. . 1 a t who since the result has been asctt tained, are shouting louder than an- tdy else. All such should be let severely alone, when the question i f nuking appointments comes up. ine Albuquerque Citizen says : "In the event that the statesmen of the ter ntory cannot agree on a candidate lor governor, the Cnizen modestly suggests the name -f Judge William C. Hazii.- dine, of this city, for the position. All patties and factions in every section of the territory will admit the Judge's fit ness for the position, and if appointed he would gracefully do the honors of the executive office with admirable ability and courtesy to all." While not being directly interested in the selection of a governor fni -New Mexico, the Journal Miner can heartily endorse the above. There may be men equally capable to fill the position, but we ;uo satisfied that our sister territory cannot get a better governor than Judge Haz'cdine would make them, if he would accept the posi tion . j The report that Phenix wants the pen itentiary, the university, the capital, the San Carlos Indian reservation, and tbe Colorado river to run through her back yard and an overland railroad on her principal sidewalks, may be a figurative expression for the energetic way in which Phenix does business, but as to facts in the case. Phenix may have as much common sense left as other parts of Ad- zona, and if she realizes anything she realizes that to be great she must have a creat territory about her. Her great want to-day is men and means to devel op the grandest natural resources the United States ever saw. and that is what she is working for. Herald. The United Status cruiser, Boston, has just returned to New York and Captain Rumsay says that from inquiry upon his arrival at Part au Prince ren carding the seizure of the steamer Hat tian Republic, he found that sbe hfd bten selling munitions af war and goiag up and down .the coast carrying incur geoti She was taken by a Haytita man-ot-war and. condemned in la tked ragular way. New men and new bleod from the re publican party will be feund in office after the advent of the new administra tion. The old republican regerae has been relegated to back seats ; it long had its days and favers and officers and under its weight the republican party went down. It has come to the frent again under impulse of new men and the old could scarcely expect, even were there any justice in it to the new workers, that they could longer shake the tree and gather the fruit. Senator Quay has sounded the key-note in this matter and it means to the party all that it meant to the inividual to whom he addressed his remarks. Phenix Herald. The Santa .Fe railroad has com menced running Pullman cars direct, without change, between Chicago and San Diego, California, via the Atlantic & Pacific railroad, making the longest continuous sleeping car service in the world, the distance being 3,311 miles. There will be in the future but one change between oceans. They also have in contemplation the running of a special limited vestibule train once a week between the above cities in compe tition with a similar train run aver the Central and Union Pacific road.

The amount of forfeited bail infthe criminal courts of New York City for the last twenty years figures up over $3,000,000. Much of it could be col lected but for political influence. Some one who went through the dormitory at Vassar college found only one bedstead without a cud of gum stick ing on the headboard. They ought t suspend her for being eccentric. The public debt of France is now over $8,000,000,000 and taxation is so high that everybody is growling and finding fault. The government must have another billion for the army, how ever.
