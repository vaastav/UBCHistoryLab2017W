Geri'1 A. M. Winn was chosen president. Colonel i>. S. Curtiss secretary, and Mr. P. Corcoran treasurer. Measures were inaugurated for promoting tlie passage of a more complete and efficient eight-hour law by Congress at the present session. ThkSj*asi?h orsnoat i^ristio* is hieoir?e of settlement by diplomacy. It m known that they have been detained l>y the government on complaint of the Peruvian minister, his representation being that they were designed to relieve other Spanish vessels which were to be emp loved in hostility against Peru.

Important Decision.?At the present term of the United States District Court at Dubuque, Iowa, an important question was argued and <iecided in connection with a charge of fraud on the Govt-rnment. The facts are the following: F. H. Doutricb was arrested for fraud ou the I>ension office, whilst the lion. C. C. Cox was Commissioner or Pensions. The accused subsequently escaped, but was rearrested and committed to prison. On bringing the case to trial it was ascertained the indictments were fatally defective; whereupon the court directed that a juror be withdrawn and new indictments he framed, the prisoner meanwhile being remandeu to prison. The new indictments having been presented, the connsel for the accused made a motion, and argued it at length, that the liberty of a party could not be twice put in jeopardy, and that the proceedings heretofore had should I>e considered a* acquitting of the charge. After an exhaustive argument the court ruled tUat the indictments must be maintained, on several grounds, but especially because if convicted on a defective indictment no sentence could be pronounced, and therefore a trial thereon would be of no eflect. The court was then appealed to and granted a continuance, on the motion of the prisoner's counsel, until the third Wednesday in April next. lion. W. F. Sapp and James P. Tustin for the Government, and Mcjsers. Wilson and Doad for the accused. Artemt? Ward set the fashion of the inconsequential lecture?that is to say if his "text had the small-pox his sermon would'nt catch it" so far apart mere they. When Artemns lectured at Willard's Hall upon the "Babes in the Wood," and had not a word to say about those unfortu it ate orphan* until the clow, when he remarked that"they were the offspring of rich,but respectable parent*, and died young," he greatly in\ stilted the matter of tact people in his audience. "Mark Twain's" lecture last night upon the Sandwich Island*, did deal somewhat with the subject, but the lecturer's approaches to it were so elaborate and involved so much masterly strategy of the sort displayed by our early Napoleons of the rebellion, that the audience began to think the3 were the victims of another A.
