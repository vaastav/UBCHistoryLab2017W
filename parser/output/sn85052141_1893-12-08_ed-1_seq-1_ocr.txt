The duty ot publlo economy la also of Immense Importance In Its Intimate and necessary relation to tbo task now In hand of providing revenue to meet government expenditures and yet reducing the peoplo'sburdeusot Icderal taxation. After a bird struggle tariff reform Is directly before us. Nothing so Important claims onr attention and nothing so clearly presents Itiell as both an opportunity and a duty an oppor tunity to ueaerro tne gratitude of our fellow eititer.s and a duty Imposed apa.i WJ sis srcvRwwwrsa) as.Wt.wi date of tbe people. After full countrymen bave spoken In favor of this reform and they have confided tho work ot Its accomplishment to tho hands ot those who aro st.mnly pledged to It. Wbllo we should staunchly adhero to tho principle that only the nti salty ut revenue Justifies tbe Imposition of tariff duties and othel fcddral taxation und that they ahould be limited by strict economy, we can not close out eyes to the fact that conditions bave grown up among us which In Justice and fairness call foi discriminating caro In the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergency ot our government actually demand. Manifestly, If we aro to aid tie people directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should to a reduction In present tarlfl charges upon the necessaries of Ufa The benefits of such a reduction rbould be palpable and snbstantlaL seen and felt by thousands, who would bo better fed. and better clothed, and better sheltered. These gifts would bo tb willing benefactions of a government whoso highest function Is the promotion of the welfare of tho people. No less closely related to our pee pies prosperity ana well being is tne removal ot restrictions upon the Importation of the raw materials necessary to our manufactures. The 1 world should be open to our national Ingenuity I and enterprise. I This can not be while federal legislation, through the imposition of high tarlfl forbids to American manufacturers as cheap materials ut those used by their competitors. It Is quits obvious that the enhancement of the price ot our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only confines the market for theso sharp competition and active struggle amoa? our manufacturers to supply the limited demand for their goods, soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows suspension cf work In mills and factories, a discharge of employes, and distress In the homes ot our UOrklnemen. Even If. the often dlSDVOTed TVS' 1 sertlon could be made good that a lower rale of ! wages would result from materials and ' low tarltl duties, the 01 our wor tngmen leads them quickly t" dlscwver that their steady emp'oyment, pertained by freo raw malerl Us, Is the most lmrx riant factor In their relation to tariff leglslatlot. A measure has been prjpan d by tho , prlatu coogrcsslonal comm tteo embodykt; tar-1 Iff reform on tho lines heroin s lggetted, which j will be promptly submitted to-legislative tlon. It is the result of much I rtrlotlo and selfish work, and I believe It d lis with Its sub-, Ject consistently and as tnorou jhty as existing conditions permit I am satit ilea mat tne re. duced tariff provided for la the proposed legislation, ndded to existing Intern il revenue taxation, will, In the near future, though perhaps not Immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet tbe needs of tho govcrnmt nt. Tho committee, after full consideration, and to provldo against a temporary deficiency which may exist before tbe business or tht country adjusts Itself to the rew tariff schedules, have wisely embraced In their plan a fo'T additional Internal revenue taxes. Including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corporate Investments. Theso new assessments are net csly absolutely Just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such ns can bo remitted without unfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great ueslro for the success of this measure lean net restrain tho suggestion that Its success can only be attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of tho friends of tariff reform, aud ns a result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to tho general good. The local laterrats affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and ho varied that If all are Insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must Inevitably fall In conclusion, my Intenso feeling of responsibility Impels me to Invoke for the manifold In- ID...1, nt n ..Ann.

SECOND SESSION Of Ihe 1 Congress Novr flea ly I'nr Huslmss. Wasiti.NOKN, Dec .". 'ihe second session of the emigres., as this Orst rcjular tesslon fif congress will lie olllclally know it in tlie records, opened Monday In both Iioum:.h with nil tho that was brought about by a lack of anticipation of excitement, nnd by nn IntlllTercnco on tho part of thoso present that has rcldoni been equaled, lnly that portion of tho galleries which Is open to the public, and which In llicte cold, biting days of December Is popttlur with the homelets fort ion of the local population, tilled. 'Iho galleries reserved for tho mi-raters' families for tl.o diplomatic ccria nnd fcr tho white homo family were almost empty, thero was little of that effusive handshaking nnd welcoming that utually marks the first Jay cf r. sew less ion because It was only n few short weeks ago that tho members tepnnitcd. Tho general knowledge that the, tariff till would rapt-i)e brought Into the hiStvso' lejr'icv" lerai qayatp come, completed tho 19 W PWsIotV' Tho presence of tho destroyer, Death, was evidenced by the heavy draperies and thu mass of white Dowers that marked the desk of lien. Lilly, tho deceased congressman at largo from Pennsylvania. A simple sheaf of ripened wheat. symbolic of the life and activity of tho man, lay on tho desk of the lato Con gressman Oncll. As the business of the house began nnd tho reporters for the press association had bent down to their work at tho little tables just be- neutli the speakers, veterans of tho house noted with a pang of regret tho absence of 'Charlie" Hayes who fcr nearly ttvo decades had reported with Intelligence tho proceedings of tho house for one of the great press as sociations. The usual ctiouctto of notifying tho president by a committee from branches of congress that a quorum of members was present and awaited any communication ho might havo to make, was followed by tho equally conventional report to each house, that the president would forthwith communicate to them "a message in writing." Behind Senators McPhcrson and Sherman, tho latter of whom by the way was tho most remarked man in the scimto to-Jay because of the largo white chrysanthemum in his button ho'o stood Maj. Prnden, the executive clerk of tho White house holding In his hand the "message in writing." After delivering the incssngc to tho senate Mr. Prudctt delivered the samo document to tho house. Tho rending In both houses was begun at half-past one o'clock. In neither house did tho reading of the messago command serious atten tion. This wns partly duo to the un interesting natura of tho document it self and partly to tho wt etched deliv ery of tho reading clerk in each house. After the reading ot the message in the houFc, Pennsylvania congressmen formally announced the death of their colleagues, Lilly and O'Xelll. Under ordinary circumstances this statement would have been made earlier In tho day, luiiiio.IiVvtoIy' after tho re'adimr ot the Journal. Monilny the announcement was delayed In order that the messago of the president might be read In tint house before that body gave its usual token of respect to tho deceased In the way of an immediate adjournment after tho announcement.
