WASHINGTON. Opening of the Short Session of Congress. Reeeption of the President's Message. The American Claims Against the Spanish Government Dilatory Negotiations Cenaured by Congressmen. CAUCUS OP BEPUBLIOAH SENATOBS. Washington, Dec. 7, 1874. Ofial?| Day 1** Congre?l?A Manoeuvre to Repeal the "Gag Law" Causes Rxcltcment. Beth bouses adjourned almost immediately alter the reading of the Message. Before the House adjourned Mr. Phelps, of New Jersey, managed adroitly to get In his bill to amend the Frellng hay sen "Gag lair." As soon as It was discovered that hU amendment would practically repeal the MQig law," the House became very lively. Gen eral Butler Insisted ou the regular order, and Mr. George F. Hoar objected also. The bill will como ap under a suspension of the rules next Monday, and will probably pass. Comments on the President's Message toy Representatives and Senators of Both Parties?Apathy of Feeling Shawn. The Message was heard In both Houses with sin gular apathy. There seemed no curiosity to near ?M President's recommendations, and conversa tion this afternoon and evening with a number of numbers and Senators shows tnat they have the misfortune to be considered ol no public Import ance. The part relating to the southern difficul ties met wltn the most appreciation, but some re publicans saw in this and In the menace toward Spain a new plan for a third term. Even the friends of contraction and resumption were not greatly pleased with the President's Anancial Ideas, thinking them crude and impracticable or vague. The Message surprised many by its very moderate tone and entire absence of scolding or recrimina tion. Others complained that It has no vl',al energy and presents no rallying point for the party. It was remarked that It leaves the party where It was belore, and has no power to gather around It the disorganized materials which the announcement of a broad, bold and positive policy ?light have had. *'An administration party which does not beilevo In the administration is in a bad way," said one member. The democrats Had' very little to say. _ They evidently think that the Message does them no harm. It was remarked that the Message contained two errors; the President states the debt of the District of Columbia at a little less than $14,ooo,ooj, whereas the report of the Board of Audit, made pabUc this evening, states It at a Uttle less than twenty millions, or at over seventeen millions, de ducting unadjusted claims, which, however, the Board says, will have to be allowed. Tne other error Is probably an oversight. The Presi dent says that at the last session of Congress a very considerable reduction was made In the rates of taxation and the number of articles taxed. But there was no change made in the taxes at the last aeeMon. The Nomination of Postmaster General Sent to the Senate. The President sent to the Senate to-day only nomination, namely, that of Marshall Jewell, of Connecticut, to be Postmaster General. Cane as of the Republican Senators on Committees. After the adjournment or the Senate the repub lican Senators held a brief caucus and appointed Messrs. Morrill, of Maine. Sargent, Scott, Ogies&y pease as a committee to report to-morrow to an adjourned meeting a revised list of Senate committees. No Important changes are antici pated In the present membership. Of Our Government Against Spain?The Indemnity Demanded? Congressmen Impatient at 'he Delay of Settlement. Negotiations lor a money Indemnity for the massacre of Americans at Santiago de Cuba have been gotng on for a long time, wiinout much bead way being made. Our government will not ac cept less than $25,000 per mar, white or colored, ??ii a larger sum for the officers. On this basis negotiations are proceeding. Spain does not deny her feapouslbllity, but her tctions are vexatlously dilatory. There Is increacing impatience with the conductor Spain, and * the House to-day some, disappointment was expressed by members that the President had not made more positive recom mendations on the Cuban question. A return ?will be asked for Id the House to show how much oar commerce wi? Cuba has suffered during the period of disorder. a Democrat* Social-Political Reunion. Representative Fernando Wood has Issued in vltatlons to neet the democratic and conservative members o'the Senate and House of Itepresenta tives, socially, at bis residence, on Thursday even ing next in congratulation of the reccnt elections. The card Is headed, "Justice is slow but sure." proposed New System of Government for the District of Columbia. The new governnieut proposed for the District oi Columbia Is remarkable in several respects, it creates a department of tne District of Columbia as part of the lederal government, aud places al most the whole lunction of government in the hands of three regents to be appolutcd by tho President. The regents appoint almost all tho heads ol boards and other officers, aud make all the ordinances or local laws. Tne heads of the Board or Education and school trustees are to be elected, and voters must, alter 1876, be able to read and write, ana must send their children to school. Congress is to authorize all expenditures. Statement by the Commissioners. The report of tho commissioners lor tho Dis trict of Columbia to the President gives the re ceipts from all sources to the 1st of December at $3,088,188, and the total expenditures at $*J,017,329, leaving a balance of $168,830, which, added to the estimated receipts to Juno SO, ol $1,634,600, will make a total ol $1,704,469. The total estimated expenditures to June 80 are $1,672,066, giving an estimated balance at that time or $132,892. They say, from their showing, that the actual debt of the District, less the as sets, is $13,994,613; but the aggregate sum thus stated Includes something more than the funded debt chargeable exclusively to the District of Co lumbia. By a former act ol Congress part of the expenses which are included in the debt are to be borne by the general government. The lull amoant of claims outstanding and still unadjusted Is $3,147,787. Proposed Treaty with the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiian envoys, who are here seeking to ne gotiate a reciprocity treaty with our government, are at work upon the terms and meanB, In order te havs a project of the treaty ready for presenta tian alter the Christmas holidays. They do not lawr a cession of Pearl River. jUeiuurd Schell as the Advocate of Rail road Subsidies. The D.on. Richard Schell openly said to-day that came to Congress as a representative of New York to yote for every railroad subsidy which Is brought forward. He thinks the country ought to be restored to a prosperous condition, that cap ital ought t^ be able to employ labor, and that it would bo a.cood thing to urepd $800,000,000 to that end.

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Important Correspondence of the State Department with Representative* Abroad?The Rights of Naturalized Citizens in Foreign Countries?The Tripoli Slave Trade?American Fili bustering in Formosa Suppressed?The Spanish Warfare in Cuba* Washington, Dec. 7, 1874. The papers concerning the foreign relations of the United States transmitted to Congress this afternoon with the President's Message make a volume of 1,222 printed octavo pages, from which tbe following Items of Interest are extracted:? In October last Acting secretary of titato Cad wallaUer addressed a letter to Minister Jay, at VlennA, acknowledging the receipt or a communi cation In reference to the c&ro of Josef Barts, wno had presented a naturalization certificate to the Austrian authorities as proof of citizenship. Mr. Cadwallader says:? The right to enjoy ?uch privileges as may attach to a citizen ol the United state* Ih properly proved by ihu production of a passport legally issued. In every case where tne action of a diplomatic or consular officer of the United Slates is invoked on behalf of a person claim ing to be a citizen ot the Unltorl htates It is Incumbent on such officer, not only to carelully and zealously guard and protect tlie rights ol all hwi& fide citizens, but alao to carefully sbstaln irom committing this government to a demand for protection on behalf ol'a person presenting a talse or fraudulent claim to citizenship. Naturalized citizens, who have become such solely to avoid tfro duties and burdens attached to a residence in and alle giance to their own country, and who have returned 10 their native country without any Intention to reside In the United States or to assume the duties or burdens common to lti citizen*, who, In other words, are de sirous of enloylng all the benefits and immunities com mon to citizens of each country, and oi avoiding all corresponding duties in each, may be held to have tor felled all right to the protection of tbs United states. Particular instructions will bo found on these questions In section SO of the personal Instructions, lately Issued. The attention of the department has also bean called on several occasions to applications for pasaports in foreign countries tonnded on certificate* ol naturaliza tion, which upon their lace bear conclusive evidence that they have been illegally or fraudulently obtained. In such cases a passnort should be relused, and the fraudulent certlilcate forwarded to this department 

NATURALIZED CITIZENSHIP. Secretary Kish, writing to charge d'Affalrca Nicholas Fish at Berlin, In August last, says:? While acknowledging the receiptor the correspond ence between Mr. Uaucrolt and the Minister ol Foreign Affairs in relation to the Interpretation and application ol the fourth article of the Naturalization treaty ol Feb ruary i2, 186m, between the United Htates and the North Herman Union, that Mr. Bancroft's note of the 28th of June to Mr. Von Hulow correctly sets forth ihe Interpre tation of that article of the treaty as understood by the foverninent. and It is with much satisfaction that the residcut learns that that Interpretation Is not controverted by the Herman government, which declares Its intention to execute tlie treaty at all times with Ihe greateit moderation and respect for the right* ot individuals. The point sug gested by Mr. Von Hulow that the treatment ot each C'ise must depend entirely upon the circumstances of the sumo Is in accord with the position which tills gov ernuicut bold*, the value of American CitUcushiy uiust not be trifled with. This high rlfht muil not be In vaded by fraud or bv lalne rcpre-eu tat Ions, and when hi nestlv acquired and faithfully m dnulned mui' ca-ry wrlili it to its possessor all Hie prr. liege* and tbe protec tlon which a great government can give ,o it* citizens. Ihc case of Menthelm Cohu vein" to be tlisposeJ ol Without admiiunu ttie iiiicrenoe drawn by Mr- von Billow from bl.? recital ot the tacts of the < aae. It cannot be denied that that internee Is at tne leiat plausible. "The leguion will m the mtiire continue careiullv to watch the rights ot all naturalised citizen* of the United States who may visit or temporarily tarry in Germany, and will assert lor them al* the privileges?n l Humanities to which tliey are entitled b.v treaty ?r by public liw. At the sain - uiae it wtil i e carefUi not to commit the gov ernment of the United states in a dtmind tor i s pro tection in bel.alf ol one who may he maniiestlr pre senting a talse or fraudulent claim ot ci izen-hip. or who u?ay have already lorteitcd his right to citizenship in accordance with the letter ami spirit ot the treaty." A CU1NB.SK INSURRECTION ENDED. Charge d'Affalrei wuiiainn. writing to the Secre tly ot State under date ol Pekin, February last, speaks 01 the reduction ol the l.n stronghold 01 the Mabonunedan rebels who controlled the noi th western provinces ol Hiensl and Kauouh lor more than ten years. He shows the merciless nature of Chinese wariare unci the rancor of ? ar as aggra vated in this rebeli on ?>y the bitterness 01 rehgous bigotry in which the Maiiouimedaus excelled. There is no reason for doubting the statements here 8lven, and as the rebels had themselves (riven no quar sr I suppose they expected none. The iu-urrection thus ended lias lett lar^e portions of these two provinces nearly depopulated and y ars must elapse betore they ean recover from the desolations ot war. In case* where these rel>els, who are said to be all pure Chinese, anil tint Turks, met bodies of native Cat hoi cs In their progress, they are reported to have always spared their lives if not lound In arms. The capture of Sun-Chan brings to an end all organized rebellion within the borders of China proper or the eighteen provinces. It beaan in 1848 in tne towns lying wost ot Canton city, and, through tlir mismanagement ot the provincial authorities, its leaders waxed stronger and more desperate, and under the name ot laeplngs tOreat Peace) nearly succeeded in dismembering tne i.mplre. They were finally subdued in 1865. Alter the capture ol Nankin the Mohtiiume. dans rose In array in the southwest and northwest, where they set the imperialists at defiance for ten years or more, but are no longer formidable, and tne lew chiefs who may have cscaped wih a small following will not be able to gather head In those devas tated districts. The manner In which orderly goverti inent. trade and rebuilding in the ruined towns has re vived in those departments In the Valley ot the Yangtze, which were lelt almost like a wilderness in IKtifl, leads us to hope lor a similar reviving in tliu western prov inces." Mr. Williams says, March 80:? "A Roman Cathollo bishop, whose diocese comprises a fiartol Manjhooria and the region contiguous to Oorea, las lately reached Pekin from Newch wang, and brings an account of an entire change in the government of Corea within the last three nion.hs. and tlie removal of the ruler who had usurped the chief authority during the past fifteen years. Tho change has been brought about without bloodshed, ami the lib-hup looks forward to a peaceable state of their missions, feeing that the new authorities are favorably disposed toward foreigners and Christianity." THB SLAVE TRADE OP TRIPOT.T. The following was received by secretary Fish (torn Sir Edward Thornton. June 30 lust:? Sir?In eompltance with an instruction from the Earl of Derby, 1 have tho honor to incioxe a copy ol a des patch Addressed to His l.ordship by Her Majesty's Con sul Ucneral at Tripoli, in which i.e expresses his i pinion that the slave traffic from Iripoli to Constantinople, via Malta, is on the decrease, and that there is no reason whatever tor hnpposliiK that the Malta police authori ties iu any way connive at its existence. TDK OPPRESSION OF ITALIAN CHILDREN. Secretary Fish, addressing count Corti, the Ital ian Minister, in May last, acknowledging the re ception ol letters referring to the aliened vagrancy ol Italian children, and the ial.se inducements un der which they are tak*-n from their native land, and inclosing an act promulgated by the Italian Parliament on the 26cn of December iast, says:? This government cordially unites with that of Italy in the hope that that government may, by tue means of this act an I the energetic enforcement ot iu most com mendable determination to suppress the traffic in tnjse poor children, referred to in your note succeed in ar resting the very Inhuman practices which the Italian government so strongly condemns. AMERICAN FILIBUSTERING IN THB EAST. Secretary Fish, writing to Mr. Bingham, onr Minister at Japan, July M las^s&ys:? Referring to your despatch. No. 73, In which yon seek instructions upon the various questions arising out of the participation of citizens ot the tinted states in the late expedition against Formosa and the employment ot an vtnencun vessel, 1 hive to inform you that your pro ceedings to detach tne citizens of the United States and the steamer hew York from the expedition are ap proved. You are referred to the Instructions already given by this department on this question, ihe au. of June 24 i860, affords ample authority to the Ministers ot the United .states to Issue writs and proclamations to prevent the citizens of the United e<tutes from enlisting In the military or naval service of China or Japan to make war upon auy foreign tower with whom the United States are at peace, or in?urrectionarv move ments, and should a warning or proclamation prove in effectual the Minister is authorized to resort to such force as may be wilhin his reach, belonging to tne United-Stutes, to accomplish the purpose. It is believed by the Department that the powers comerred upon the Ministers of the United States by this act will prove sufficient in these eases. The representatives ot the gov ernment will take every means to prevent any viola tion of these provisions of law, and it Is be lieved that in most instances no actual resort to force will be required. Your response to the represen tation ot General Lezendre, that the act of 143) was un- 1 constitutional Is approved. No otlicer of the govern ment is made a I. dge of the constitutionality of an act ol Congress, and all acts are to be deemed constitutional until the ques.ion be legally decided otherwise. This department nas been officially intorm.-d by the Secretary ot *ar that Mr. Wasson, who was attached to the expedition against Formosa above reierred to, has not been In Lbs service of the United Males since J uly 1, im MACKENZIE'S RAID INTO MEXICO. It appears irotn the diplomatic correspondence that lur. Mariscal, the Mexican Mluister, has lor mally protested against the invasion by General Mackenzie of Mexican soli In pursuit of Indians, saying:? ? In view of the good faith and friendly spirit which ac tuate the government of the United States Iu its relations with Mexico my government hopes that an act similar to the one in question wll not be committed hereafter, and that if any measures shall be deemed necessary iu order to remedy evils ou the frontier which It mav be neces sary to carry out on Mexican soil such measures will be adopted and carried out by both governments lointly, since an incurvion ot foreign troops into ibe territory of Mexico besides being at variance with the principles which govern nitiousin time of peace, may In my country brin/ the administration into very he. lous conflicts and materially disturb the peace of the Republic, ibis last consideration will probably be sufficient for a friendly government, for it will not wish to run the risk ot causing such terrible evils to Its neigh bor when it relies udou the good will ot the latter to se cure the Just ends which It seeks to attain. THB SPANIARDS IN CUBA. Hod. Caleb Cu9hing, writing to Secretary Fish from Madrid, In July last, says:? According to the latest official estimates here the num ber of troops sent from the Peninsula to Cuba from the year 1869 down to the present dav, is b2 SOU, ol which number 36.411 have succumbed In the field or trom dis ease, leaving only a nominal foroe ot say 46,000, many of whom must be Invalids, for the present service of the government, in addition to which it deserves to be noted tbat a large number ot muskets pur chased by the last Captain-General lor use in Cuba have been withdrawn and orderod home tor use In the Peninsula. It Is not surprising that under these circumstances great discouragement should prevail in official circles hero, to say nothing of the un certainty, more or less, respecting tiie purposes and ac tions of political parties throughout the country, with the great question rising above all others whether or not at some unexpected moment the troops may not "pronounce." for it is no exaggeration to say that the political fortunes of Spain at all times during tbe present generation, and never more so than at the present time, are mainly dependent on the will of the army. The con scription will yield at least SI, 000 men for tbe army ; it will also yield to the treasury at least Son.000,(WO or reals ($15,000,(MO) on amounts paid for exemption. Secretary Pish, writing to Minister Cashing, August 27, says I acknowledge the receipt of yonr Interesting despatch of the :*)th nit. No. 66, In relation to the possibility of Kurupean Intervention in the atralrs of Spain, it con firms the accounts which have reached this country of atrocities in warfare which seem incredible in the nine teenth eentury, wh'eli aro without excuse or palliation, and a contluuancu of which would be degrading to human nature.

AFFAIR. Much of the correspondence under the head of Spain relates to the vircunius affair. The results up to the end or last year are already known. Nothing appears regarding negotiations since that tune. BRUTAL OONDUOi' ON BO ABO AN AMEBIC AN SHIP. [From tbe Liverpool Mercury, Nov. 2C.] The American ship Nancy Pendleton, Captain Pendleton, wnieh left Penarth Docks on Monday night, coal laden, for Point de dalle, was shortiy alter leaving dock the scenc or a frightful tragedy. It appears that the ship was entirely manned by colored men, the officers bslng white. The crew were perfectly sober, and It Is Maid tliat the officers began to strike the rncu with billets of wood, capstan bar* and belaying; pins without nnr ap parent provocation. The cries or the men were heard by the crews of several vessels as she passed ana also by the tugboat Columbus, which was towing her, and the men in the pilot boat towing astern. Tbe captain or the Columbus, shortly air'er the vessel rounded i'enartn Head, heard two shots tired oil board the BUip, and soon alter a man got on the martingale ami called out that uis brother had been shot and pleaded to be taken aBhore. The man was, however, ordered on board, and was no more seen, it appears tnat the first snot was fired from the direction of the poop right among the men on the main deck. The mate, who had been aft, rusned lorward and shot one of the crew right between the eyes, lie staggered along the deck to the forecastle, and when passing the galley the cook or steward dealt him a severe blow with an axe, laying hU face open. Tbe poor fellow got to the lorecastle only to meet the cap tain, wno pinned him aown, when the Kngiish pilot interierod, and threatened to leave the ship if the maj was not at once released. The man was then carried to nls bunk below. All tins oc curred while the ship was between Penartb and Lavernock Point. The tugboat was ordered to tow to the Nash, the pilot leavlug her at Landy Island on Tuesday morn ing, and on arriving at Cardiff yesterday at once lodged the information wltn the police. As It is blowing a gale lrom the southwest, it la probable that the ship may be overhauled before leaving the land. ? THE WEATHER TE8TEBDAY.

THE GRASSHOPPER PLAQUE. What General Priabin Saw During a Tour of Inspection. NAKED AND HUNGRY. At a committee meeting or the Produce Ex change held yesterday afternoon General Bnsbln. of Omaha, appeared beiore the Board on behalf or the suffering poor of Nebraska. Toe members, after listening to the pathetic story of General Hrisbiu, decided to send on to General Ord at Omaha a sum of $i,ooo remaining over in the I charity fund of the Board at onoe, and requested the General to visit them at the meeting of the full Board to be held to-day and explain the objects of bis generous mission, acoordtng to the most reliable authori ties, 10.000 people In the State of Nebraska are at the present moment in a state of almost absolute destitution. They are the population of a long belt of country on the western frontier of the Slate over which the grasshoppers pas.ed last summer. When the plague had apparently ended and the suffering condition of the population of that district was discovered, every effort m their power was made to assist the distressed by the authorities and citizens of the state. The de strootion of the crops nad been so complete and the resources leit the settlers were so slight that tne demands for help were far in advance of the supplies that conid be gathered by those who had taken the work of mercy In hand. They strupiried ravely with It for a time, but were so entirely unable to meet the famine rushing in upon m that they were obliged to acknowledge an appeal to charity outside the State necessary. The first step taken m the way of asslstlnsr those who had lost all they possessed was the establishment of a relief society. It was called the Omaha Aid Society. On finding out the inability of this association to meet the urgency the Governor of the state called a convention and a new organization was established under the title of the Nebraska State Aid and Relief Society. General E. O. C. Ord, commanding the Department of the Platte, was requested to lend bis assistance to the work, and he generously and promptly took the matter in hand. General Ord at once sent officers of the army to Inspect THE 

SUFFERING BEATON and report the result. Committees, composed of live citizens in each of the counties embraced In the belt, were appointed and through them the supplies obtained were distributed. The army agencies along the route of the Uulon Paciflc Rail way were made the depots for the issuing of the supplies and the headquarters for stores was established at Omaha. No expense of any kind was incurred?or Las been up to the present time and all that could be got was sent to the people as speedily as possible. . To make everything reliable and ascertain that no Inatten tion of favoritism should creep In, two inspectors were appointed to look after the details of the committee's labors. One of these inspectors was commissioned to the country north of the Platte Uiver, the other to the district south of it. Their salaries were paid by the Cnl.n Paclflo and the Burlington and Missouri railroads. While there was the remotest possibility of being able to carry the poor over the winter and until they could grow sufficient food for themselves, General Ord and the Society confined their solicitations for help to the limits of the State. The moment came at last when they lelt compelled to appeal to the benevo ,eBce or th? country, and they did not hesitate, in view of the terrible situation of ao many souls, to make known the actual condition of affairs. General Brtsbln, of Omaha, who had visited the plague atrlcken country, and had fur nished General Ord with an elaborate report, was commissioned to travel through the Eastern States i and acquaint the people with the distress of the settlers. General Brlsbin has arrived in New York, and was visited yesterdsy at his hotel bv a r SnSftZfir ? Hkbald? 'a describing the people and their situation be said THIaK

We live on a soldier's clatin. My husband was a soldier in the Second Illinois cavalry lor lour years, and served under General Ord. We have a good farm, and feel like sticking to m of couroe, after being on It so long, we dislike to give It up. We have no money in the world except ten cents thai 1 have. All our crops were destroyed, both last year and this year, and we have now literally nothing. So horses, hogs, cattle oreneep. I am baking my last loal 01 bread 10 day, and 1 wondered where 1 would get door to make any more. 1 was thinking about it all day and had latth to believe that some good Samaritan would come alon^ and bnug me flour. 1 did not despair, Jor God will not LET US STARVB. Our women are nearly out of shoes, under garments and dresses. 1 nave had out one new calico dress In a year. I was educated at the Normal School in Illinois, and taught six years betore I was married, and two years since. Iheso are hard times that have fallen upou us. It Is unpleasant to accept charity, but the truth is, wo are in great need, and many more lamllics are just as badly off as my own." I went into another cabin by the road and fouud a little girl, scarcely ten years old, keeping her brotners and si-ters. In reply to Inquiries 1 put her she said:?"My mother and lather are out hay* ing lor a neighbor. There are five cnudren or us. I am the oldest. We have a 11'tie flour In the bar rel. Kather had a pig, but he killed it and we ate It all up long ago. Father says, 'When the floor Is out we will starve.' but mother says, '?<d will take care ot us.' Our neignnor, Mrs. Winters, Is as badly (iff as ourselves, and. Mr. Foster is worse off. We nave no shoes or stockings. We have one dress apiece. Mother has no Btioes. Father and* mother are out working-to get $0 to pay Mr. Austin. We owe him that much, and rarner says it must be paid. We have no sugar, tea or coflee, nor anything to eat but flour, and we are thankiul lor that." so lar as lay in my power I relieved the wants or the lamllies I visited, and then hastened back to Omaha to lay the condition of these poor people beiore the authorities and the couutry. Omaha rallied AT ONCE AND SENT RELIEF. For six weeks the people or Nebraska have been feeding the uuiortunates. it requires $40,000 a month to leed and clothe them, and oi course Ne braska unulded cannot carry sucti a load. 1 do not believe in makiug Congress an almshouse for tho nation's poor, and I thing the right thing to do id this case is lor the gener ous people or the couutry to give Irom their abundance enough to leed and clothe the destl* tute Nebraskiaus until they can raise crops and rako care or themselves. Such an amount wllL never be missed out or the great storehouses. These people are the pioneers of this nation. Tney are all natives or other States, some irom New York. Not a ramily among them had ever seen want beiore, and the manner in which they took the blow is proof of tbelr noble mettle. It ts difficult to make people wno have always been accustomed to liv ing in large cities leel the total want of these hctoio settlers, but nothing shall be lelt undone on my part to make the case a clear one. 1 have already gained a good point. Mr. John. Italesties has placed the lower floor of the build* lug No. u Barclay street at the'disposal 01 the settlers. We have established a headquarters lor the reception or clothing tor them. We wane that badly, lor 1 do not exaggerate when I sar many oi them ire naked. Tnat is not in brick houses either or tenements, but nuts and dug outs and cabins, with li>rge ventilation. Tne State has done and is doing wonders. FJvery bank in Omaha Is now paylug a rate of $60 a mouth to belp the plague-stricken people, and every storekeeper and mer chant 1b giving according to his business, irom $16 a month up. 1 know New York. 1 know tue great, generous heart or the people, ana I have profound faith in It. The people nave intrusted the delicate and difficult task of getting tnem out or this trouble to us, the officers of the army, be cause they kuow we estimate their sufferings and sympathize with their distress. FAMUIE IH KAHSAb. From Kansas, as well aa from Nebraska, cornea a wall or distress canned by the destitution of the iron tier aettlera who are BUfienng from the ravages of the clouds of grasshoppers, which came upon them like a devouring army laat summer ana consumed ail the growing crops. On these crops the aettlera depended for the means to supply all tueir wants, to bny their clothing and feel, aa well as to feed their families througn the present win ter ud the coming summer. Every green thing was swept away by the hungry insects, who stayed aa long as they oonld find lood in theflelds and when tuey left nothing remained tor tue dis heartened settlers, most or whom had Invested all tueir means In the growing crops. Thousands of these people in the western section of tne S'.ate are utterly destitute and must perish from want of clothing, mel and rood If they no not receive suc cor. A relief committee has been termed, with it* chief office at Topelta, and composed of the Ores citizens or the State. This committee now appeals to the charity of New York and the Eastern States lor aid in thia work of relieving the distress. For this purpose they have aent hither Judge Rick* seeker to solicit from our charitable people con tributions of clothing, provisions or money. He Is at present located at No. 245 Broadway, room la, where he will be ready to explain tuilv the condi tion or the sutTerer8 and to receive the gins of the benevolent. It is to be hoped that the natural sympathy lor a wide and hard-pressing suffering, against which no prudence could provide, will in* spire abundant contributions ior tuts most worthy caarlty. LYCEl'H OF 

NATURAL HISTORY. The question of changing the name of "The Ly ceum of Natural History In the City of Now York" came up before that body last evening at their stated meeting. The feeling both pro and eon seemed to be quite intense, and the matter was finally disposed of for the present by the adoption of the following report or the committee, the vote to be taken at the regular meeting in February The Committee report in tavor of changing the name of ?"'file Lyceum ot Natural History in the City ol New York." to "New York Academy ot Sciences,?' for the following reasons: ? Fin*?The present name of the society Is cumbrous from Its length. Semntl?The term lyceum has lost Its appropriateness for purely scientific organizations, since it has been adopted by theatres, and mure especially by circles of Spiritualists throughout the country* Third?The present name of the society does not seen rnlcly express the scope ot it* deliberations and actions ln*smuch as many ot the subjects discussed in Its meet ings more properly belong tn the sciences ot chemistry, physics, technology, Ac., whlc.i are not branches of natural history. fourth?since onr society Is the only purely scientific organization in tlio city, It should be comprehensive enough tn Its scope to inciude in Its membership those working in ail departments of science, and its catholicity should tie expressed by its title, so that no class of scientists should be even nominally, as they now are, excluded irom its membership aud meetings. Fi/lh?The Lyceum ot Natural History, lor various reasons, one or which is the exoluslveness implied In Its title, has tailed to secure the co operation ot a large Lumber ot scientific workers and natrons of science, wiiosa sympathv and support It needs and deserves, up to Die present tunc the l.vceum of Nnturnl History has been without a nxed habitation, and has been unable to command commodious and sale quarters tor its meet ings. its very valuable litirary and its co.lections. Moreover It has failed to secure tnat piominent and In fluential position which a scientific society should at tain in the city ol New York, and such as is held by similar associations in other cities. Your committee is Impressed with tho conviction that no laudable means should lie left untried to secure tor tills old and hunorable institution the position aud Influ ence honed tor by its founders, and due to tbe impor tance of the position which it occupies in tiie metropoli tan city ol the United Mates. As one step toward this end, we earnestly recommend that it should assume the broader aud higher name of "The New York Academy of dclenoes." Itespectfully submitted, J. 8.
