The cable reports indicate that there is more space devoted to Hawaii in this message lhan in any other since the islands became a Territory. Not since the lays when Hawaii was an international problem have we been dis cussed at such length in a Presidential message. It is reasonable to suppose that there will be a correspondingly large amount of attention given to Hawaiian matters in the coming sessions of Congress. The most important recommendation is the one relating to finances, which is the result of a suggestion from here, originating, as the gov ernor says, with District Attorney Brcckons. The President express ly recommends that seventy-five per cent of our federal revenues be set aside as a fund for educational purposes, construction of military and naval defenses and for public buildings, in the islands. This would mean an annual fund of about $Soo,ooo to be spent here by the federal government, enough to make the difference between dull times and prosperity in many lines of activity here. It would mean public im provements on a splendid scale, and the development of military and naval defenses which would call for large bodies of American soldiers and seamen to be stationed here all the time, manifestly to the great benefit of the community. The recommendation as to labor was to have been expected. Even leading local men who have utged the admission of Chinese in tlie past, have of late changed their views in this respect. Judge Dole, .who as governor recommended in his annual reports that Chinese be admitted under proper restrictions, only recently published a thought fully essay in which he took strong grounds in favor of securing only immigrants. .capable of forming American citizenship. Our leading employers of labor have turned to Europe for a supply of work men, in sympathy with the natural American demand that the islands be Americanized. On the very day that the news comes of the Presi dent's eniphatic declaration against the admission of servile classes of Asiatics, the news goes in the other direction that Hawaii is sending to Europe for a thousand white families. The recommendation as to Chinese is practically certain to be fal lowed. It is a negative proposition, all Congress has to do is td leave matters as they are as far as Chinese arc concerned, and that . Congress will do. The need of fortifications has been pressed upon, Congress so long that work will be needed to get appropriations start ed, but it is evident that the President has very forcibly called atten tion to the matter. The financial proposition is a new one, but start ; ing with the President's strong backing it has a fine chance. Citizens .of the Territory who have influential friends at Washington, and there are many of them, will do well to put in their words and help.

Man after man has taken out a policy largely because it was represented to him as a good investment, even if he had in mind also the advhatage which might come to his family from the strictly insurance feature. In that the main purpose of a life in surance company must be life insurance all should agree with Mr. 'McCurdy; but the responsibility for making the public think that art entirely legitimate purpose Is that of furnishing a place of investment r sts chiefly with men like him who have devised many beguiling forms of endowment and dividend insurance. It is not easy to concur with Mr. McCurdy that the life insurance companies are eleemosynary and philanthropic, even if he does receive a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year in the service of one of the best known. They are strictly business enterprises, by means of which a man is afforded the means of buying life insurance.
