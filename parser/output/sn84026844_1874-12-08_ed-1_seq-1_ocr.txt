Our space ia largely taken up with Ike President's Message this morning. The document was sent into Congress at noon yesterday and promptly transmitted by telegraph to this and other points. It will be lound in cxtenso on our third page. No one would pick tho President out lor a professional writer of state papers. Thero will be no suspicion that any pen save his own was employed In getting up the message sent into Congress yesterday It bears evidence ol emenation lrom an unpracticed writer?from ono to whom composition is an unlamiliar and probably an uncongenial employment. Nevertheless the message is an easily understood document. It is a business paper all the way through. Its chief feature is its opening discourse on the finances. The views ol last spring are renewed and reinforced with considerable warmth. In fact tho President manifests a zeal that almost borders on Impatienco and apprehension in regard to specie payments. He is a long wry lurther on in that direction than he oidu Oiia limi* a trnnr n<rn Tf tea a l?ia messago of December, 1878, that misled Congress as to what he would do with Hie inflation bill, and that stultified such Republican leaders as Morton nod bonis before the country. The marvelous Jones?the specie Benator from Ntvada?who is credited with the inspiration ol the April veto?is still a potent spell on the Presidential mind. The present bold re affirmation of the views then expressed leaves no hopo whatever that Mr. Grant, who Mrs. Grunt say9 is a very "stubborn man," will change. Henceforward, therefore, we may count upon his active influence in favor ol the repeal of the fj?gal tender act and a resumption of specie payments. And in his efforts to this end the country will gradually acquiesce. We say gradually, for, as wo remarked yesterday, there is going to be nothing done ol a definite character iu regard to the finances either by this or the next Congress. Tho Republicans will let the n.,UIn tl.n lw,nna r.f ouiyui.1 ??.. .u .uv " '1'^" ?" *?iiic.jus their losses in tlio late elections, and the Democracy will avoid it lor fear ol endangering their success. And thus the business will bo laid on tho table until alter the Presidential election of 1878. Aa for tho other topics treated upon in the Message they aro not ol sufficient moment to call for special comment. The late Louisiana imbroglio is alluded to and tho action ol the government explained and defended in regard to the attempted usurpation. The President very proper ly refers the whole matter to Congress, and reminds members that they failed to do their duly in the premises at the last session He also gives a short history ol the Atkansas troubles, and turns over that Stale along with Louisiana to the atleation ol Congress. For further particulars in regard to tho contents ol the Message wo refer readers to the document itself. The Pittsburgh Lockout. The Pittsburgh papers of yesterday give tho proceedings of the final conference that took place Saturday afternoon between the iron manufacturers and puddlers. There was some warmth ol feeling manllested in tho discussion, but u9 a general thing tho language used was that of moderation. Both sides evinced firmness of purpose and 11 the puddlers have any intention of an ultimate compromise their spokesman did not declare it In ilie mrclini' The QazttU con jeclures that the lockout will throw about 15,000 parsons out o( employment, including puddlers, coal miners, and laborers. That paper also Bays that it has been asserted that the treasury ol the 1'uddlers Union contains $100,000, to be used in just euch an emergency as the present lockout, but on the other hand it is alleged that the members have been assessed one dollar a week each to support the strikers at Troy, Now York, and that the funds on hand are light. According to the card now in force the puddlers were getting $0 per ton, and were making Ave heats per day, equal say to one and one-eighth ton, or $0 75 per day. Oat of this they paid their helpers $2 23, leaving them $1 00. At the proposed reduction they would havo earned |3 70 net, and their helpers $1 85. Our Pittsburgh dispatch this morning ahows that the lock-out has commenced In dead earnest. Out of 800 puddling furnaces in that city and vicinity but 73 arc lit up, and these only temporarily. Zut's Mill shut down on Saturday evening and discharged 300 hands. This was dono Irrespective ol compromise, as tho proprietors allege that even at the reduction there is no inducement to run. It costs (25,000 a year in interest, insurance, Ac., for this mill to stand idle. And yet it has cloaed rather than run at present prices for Its product. Tho Uautte understands that at some of the mills there is a six months supply ol "muck" iron. It alsounderstands that the orders on hand among tho manufacturers do not amount to much, and that the; can therefore allord to go slow until prospects improva. Owing to tho present difficulty a good deal of money will retire from circulation. It is estimated that the mills at Pittsburgh and vicinity circulate about (150,000 per day. The expense of tho American Iron Works, (Jones & L/luohliks) arc alone $20,000 per day. A certain amount of this money will of course now lie dormant and thereby cause no little distress. During the conference on Saturday Mr. B*nnktt stated that all the mills In Philadelphia, with one exception, hive stopped. Alio that tho Troy mills are all standing [die. BY

YiCKsnuno, December 7 ?There has been ior some time past trouble brewing between the Tax-payers' Association and the citizens and the county ofllcl'ils. The Sheriff was acting without a legal bond, and the Board ol Supervisors refused to order a new one, though the time for paying taxes had arrived. Two or thrco other officials were under indictment for forgery and embezzlement, and the citizens, despairing of any relief from partisan courts, last Wednesday held a meeting and in a body proceeded to the Court llouse to demand the resignation ot the Sheriff, Chancery Clerk, Treasurer and Coroner. All lied except Sherill Crosby, a negro, and he signed his resignation. On Saturday a card appeared on the streets, bearing Crosby's signature, calling on all the Hepublican citizens ol Warren county, white and black to come to his aid and support him in his position. Crosby publicly aud through the papers denied the authorship of the card. Yet this morning armed bodies of negroes appeared advancing on the city from six ditlercnt roads. The alarm was sounded about 9 o4clock and the citizens gathered enmass and armed immediately and advanced to meet the negroes on Baldwin's Ferry road. The negroes were met juBt outside the city, near Trone street, about 200 strong. The commander ol the citizens warned the negros to disperse, but they relused, and immediately firing commenced lrotn both sides. The negroes retreated about a mile and again made a stand in an old breast works and a house, but were soon routed. The loss in this engagement was one citizen, Oliver Brown, killed, and about 12 or 15 negroes were killed, several wounded and about 20 wero taken prisoners. On Hall's Kerry road about 250 negroes wero fouud and routed atter a short engagement in which several of tho negroes wero killed and wounded. Andrew Owens, tho negro who commanded the negroes on Baldwin's Ferry[road, was captured and committed to jail. .jVjjiaj In an interview with a lkrald reporter Owens said that he was ordered by Sheritf Crcabytocomo to the city today with all the armed men he could get together. Alexander Stackhouee, from Uewton, one ol the capturcd negroes, says the order for nil the negroes to come to Vicksburg this morning was read iu church Sunday. Crosby, who is under guard at the Court House, denies that he gave such orders. It is reported this evening that the negroes arc committing depreJationB in the country. Tho intense excitement that prevailed this morning has subsided to a great degree, yet many citizens are under arms and all the roads are picketed. At a public meeting this evening the following was adopted: Rewind, That whilo we are fully satisfied that Peter CroBby has caused armed negroes to march on the city, and should thereforo be hold mainly responsible for all the blood that has been shed, we recommend all good citizens to abstain from inliictiog any personal violence upon him, and that we use still further eflorts to have him removed from olHec in some legal manner; LATER. The evidenco just received renders it absolutely ccrtain that Qov. Ames and his Attorney General George ? Harris incited and advised invasion ol this city by the negroes to-day. This evidence has been laid before the ablest lawyers of tho city with a view to arresting and bringing these parlies to this city lor trial. OHIO LE(>I31jATlTItE.

ORLEANS. New Orleans, December 7. ?The Vicksburg reports in circulation last nigbt that a large body of armed negroes were on their way to the city to take possession ol the court house, were confirmed this morniog at nine o'clock, when the alarm bells were rung to alarm the citizens. The business bouses ol all kinds are closed and the whites, under arms, are marching out on the various roads to meet the enemy. The court house is in the possession ol the whites and the negro sheriff a prisoner. Great excitement prevails. TUB CITY ATTORNEYSHIP. City Attorney Lacy resigned a (e? days ago and suggested the necessity ol at once filling the vacancy. The City Council accordingly elected B. P. Jonas City Attorney. When bo went to take possession ot bis office this morning be found one ol II r. Lacy's assistants in possession, with a commission Irom Oov. Kellogg appointing him, Walsh, City Attorney, via Lacy resigned. The city administrators met, and alter examining the law became satisfied they bad power to elect a cily Attorney, and that Walsh was an interloper. They went to the cily Attorney's office and requested Walsh to turn it over,to Jonas, which be declined to do, but as the administrators were there to put him out, he finally turned over the kcyB, books and papers to Mayor Leeds, and withdrew under protest, stating that he would contest the matter before tbe courts. Tbo city charter provides that the new Council at the first regular meeting shall elect the City Attorney. This provision of the law was complied with. It is stated that Jonas was elected in less than ten minutes after Lacey'a resignation was read by Council. Therefore, when Walsh waB appointed there was no vacancy. The Council has power to dismiss tho City Attorney. They will adjourn from day to day and dismiss all appointees of the Governor and employ counsel to attend to the citys legal business. The council also has power to regulate the salary of tho City Attorney. It they can't get rid of Walsh any other way they propose to reduce the salary to one hunred dollars per annum. The administrators are determined not to have Walsh or any other Kellogg appointee in the City Hall. With a quorum iu both Houses the Returning iBoard will then refer the contested parishes to the Legislature, and that body will throw out the Conservatives and call upon the President lor troops to sustain them. Prominent Conservatives assert that this is tbe radical programme. 

SLOW PilOORBSP. The Returning Board is getting along slowly. Returns from about twenty Parishes "were contested and laid aside; about fifteen of them gave Conservative majorities. It is now believed the Board will promulgate the returns from other Parishes giving a Republican majority iu the Legislature. PITTS IK'KCII. ELECTION OF 11AILHOAD OFFICERS.
