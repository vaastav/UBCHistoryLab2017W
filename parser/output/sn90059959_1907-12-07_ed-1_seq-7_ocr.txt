10 WORD OF CHIEF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S ME3- SAGE IS READ BEFORE HOUSE AND SENATE. OCCASION IS MARKED BY GREAT CEREMONY Introduction of Annual Report Into Both Branches Occupies Friday's 8ession—Oklahoma's First Legis lature Sends Greetings. Washington. Dec. 4.—The annual message of the president of the Unit ed States was read before congress Tuesday. Within a minute after its receipt Secretary Bennett had begun the reading of the document to the senate under directions from the vice president. The message was present ed to the senate by Assistant Secre tary to the President Latta, who had followed immediately upon the heels of Senators Allison and Teller, con stituting the committee which had made the customary call upon the president. "We have called upon the president," the venerable senator from Iowa, standing in the center aisle be side the equally venerable senator from Colorado, said in low and impres sive tones, "and he informs us that he will communicate with the senate In writing immediately." Fairbanks Handles It First. "A message from the president of the United States," announced Mr. Latta much- more distinctly, as the two committeemen parted to permit the introduction of the president's re port. The document was immediate ly forwarded to the desk of the vice president and as soon as the wrapping could be removed the vice-president laid it before the senate. The secre tary read with deliberativeness and distinctness and was followed close ly by many of the senators who held printed copies of the message in their hands. The galleries were crowded and many of the visitors also gave close attention to the reading. Before the president's message was received by the senate Tuesday the oath of office was administered to Jo seph F. Johnston, who succeeds the late Senator Pettus as a senator from Alabama. His credentials were pre sented by Senator Culberson of Texas, who escorted him to the vice-presi dent's platform where the oath was administered by Vice-President Fair banks. Menage Is Lone Subject. The house of representatives assem bled Tuesday with but one object in view which was to listen to the read ing of the president's message and. ad Journ. The galleries showed that the interest of the public in the proceed ings of the house was almost as great as on the opening day. When the speaker had called the house to order and Mr. Couden, the blind chaplain, had Invoked the Di vine blessing, several Republican mem bers presented themselves before the speaker's desk to say that they had voted for Mr. Cannon as speaker and that their names were not recorded. They were in each case permitted to make the record correct. Mr. Page (New York), from the committee appointed by the house to notify the president that congress had met and was ready to receive any communication he might wish to make, reported that a message would soon be sent to the house. Speaker Announces Document. The speaker announced that he had received a communication that ordi narily he would refer to a committee after the organization of the house, but he thought it so important he would have it read at once. The pa per proved to be a telegram from the Oklahoma legislature to the house of representatives. "Oklahoma's first state legislature," ft stated, "just organized, inspired by the fond reality of local self-govern ment, sends greetings to the Sixtieth congress of the greatest nation on earth, and conveys to her sister states a message of progress and prosperity and loyal devotion to the union and the common good." The speaker himself read this mes sage In an impressive manner, and as he concluded the house broke into ap plause. A recess was then taken un til 12:30 o'clock. Message Is Read. When the house convened after the brief recess the president's secretary appeared at the door of the hall and at once the message of the president was laid before the house by the speaker and its reading begun by the clerk. Printed copies of the docu ment were distributed among the members, who made a close scrutiny of the message while the reader plod ded along apparently only for the ben efit of the people in the galleries.

SEEK MINERS Fl.JD BODIE, MORE THAN 30 DEAD WORKERS TAKEN FROM NAOMI TRAP. Work of Rescue Is Retarded by Fear of a Second Explosion—Frenzied Women on Scene. Pittsburg, Dec. 4.—Bodies of more than 30 miners caught by an explosion of fire damp Sunday night in the Naomi mine of the United Coal com pany, located near Fayette City, 35 miles south of this city, have been reached by the rescuers. All were dead and their bodies were burned and charred almost beyond recogni tion. The rescuers are now nearing the end of the workings and they have found no sign of life anywhere. In the opinion of the owners of the mine few if any more victims will be found, but among miners and others in the village there is a firm belief that the total number of victims is be tween 40 and 50. After finding 11 bodies near the twenty-ninth entry shortly before mid night, the rescuers went to work with renewed energy to explore the remain ing seven entries. There are 36 en tries in all, and until the last of these has been searched the full extent of the disaster will not be known. Be cause of the accumulation of gas, the work of rescue in the remote sections of the mine is greatly impeded. A second explosion is a constant menace and every precaution is being taken to avert such a' catastrophe. Eleven bodies were found at entry No. 29 shortly before midnight, but were not brought to the surface until morn ing because the rescuers did not want to delay the search by taking them up and because it was desired to dis perse the big waiting crowd that sur rounded the shaft. Scores of frenzied women constant ly surround the pit mouth, and the special detail of officers has much trouble in keeping them from interfer ing with the work of the rescuers. Many of these women would go down the shaft and penetrate the workings of the mine were they not restrained by the officers. A large force of physicians was hur ried to the scene immediately follow ing the first reports of the explosion. So far their services have not been needed for the men in the mines, but they have not been idle. In fact, they have been in almost constant requisition on behalf of the rescuers, who, despite the fact that they work In relays only a fraction of an hour, are constantly being prostrated by the fumes of the gas. A number of the rescuers have been taken from the scene In a serious condition. ST. PETERSBURG CHEERS TAFT. Russian Capital Greets United States Secretary of War in Gala Dress.

Berlin, Dec. 5.—The policy of the Imperial chancellor, Prince Von Bue low, of governing by a coalition of the national liberals, the radicals and the conservatives, appears to be seriously endangered by the attack delivered upon the government Wednesday by Dr. Herman S. Pasche, first vice-presi dent of the reichstag, and one of the national liberal leaders, in tlie mat ter of the Harden-Von Moltke scan dal as well as on the proposed finan cial measures. Prince Von Buelow lias given the leaders of the so-called "Bloc." to un derstand that the situation which lias arisen embarrasses him. lie caused dissolution of the reichstag a year ago upon assurances that the parties of the "Bloc" would support him, "but now he is suddenly and unexpectedly attacked, and he asks what may be expected of the future. The imperial chancellor distinctly intimated that, he would resign unless he was adequately supported. Wednesday's session of the reich stag adjourned at an early hour in order to give the leaders of the "Bloc" time to consider the situation and con sult with their supporters. There is much talk of a "chancellor crisis," but this at the present moment seems too strong a phrase to apply to the situation. A way out may be found by the national liberals accepting the declarations made by Gen. Von Einem, the minister of war, that the investi gations against the officers incrim inated In the Harden-Von Moltke scandal will be pushed forward rigor ously. Minister of War von Einem an nounced that Emperor William had or dered the suspension of the court of honor proceedings against. General Count Wilhelm von Holienau, who, to gether with Major Count. Johannes Lynar was compromised by the testi mony given in the course of the Hard en-Von Moltke libel suit.. This ac tion means that Count von Hohenau must take his chances in an ordinary court of justice. The minister of war announced further that Count von Ho henau and Count. Lynar had presented themselves for trial and that the cases would take the usual course. This an nouncement created a great sensation. The remarks of the minister of war were called forth by the speech of Dr. Herman S. Pasche. TO

After tho reading of the titles to tho bills had progressed for some time Senator Till man made an effort, to relieve the sen ate of the tedious routine by suggest ing the application of the senate rule permitting senators to withhold their petitions and bills until after tho morning hour and then hand them to the clerk without, formality.
