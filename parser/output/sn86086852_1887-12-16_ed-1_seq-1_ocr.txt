A SUFFERING TXFAAT” INDUSTRY. The announcement was made on Satur day, that the Joliet, Illinois, steel com pany would close their mills indefinitely on the 23rd inst.; and quick as lightning could carry it the word was passed to the republican press that the president’s message was the cause. To give force to the matter, the superintendent of the company, Mr. B. S. Smith said, that “one year ago to day the mills bad orders for 80,000 tons of rails for 1887 delivery, but to day they have not orders fur a sin gle ton of rails for 1888 delivery. He did not know the reason, be thought perhaps, the railroads ware waiting to set what congress would do. lie judgid from President Cleveland’s message that an at tempt would be msdc to reduce the tariff to a basis of revenue only, that would cheapen the price of rails to aucb a de gree that the railroads could save a good deal of money by waiting.” Without considering any other ques tion pertaining to the subject the one suggested in the conclusion, relating to the cheapn* s-t of the price of rails by re moval of at least a portion of the duty thereon, there remains enough to engage the attention of every voter in the conn try. The enhanced cost of railroad building in this country resulting from the tariff, has been of astounding magnitude Tne amount could it bo computed would astonish the most indifferent. Allot this increased cos* is added to construction’ and upon it is based the rates erf travel and freight on all the re,ads that have been built. Nut a passenger nor a pound erf freight passes over any road that does not have ter pay a share erf this added cost. And all that the iron manufacturers may reap a rich harvest. “But,” says some erne, “the tariff keeps up the* price of labor. ’ If that is true, why, lot it bo asked, is there such a universal com plaint among the< employees of the manufacturers? One of two things is true, eithrr the tariff does not protect labor err labor is complaining witherut cause. The upshot erf the whole matter is, and every one knows it, that the manufacturer pockets what protec tion gives him and does nut find it necessary to divide with his labor. If homo labor will not submit to his ex actions ho ot onoo fills sp his mills with foreign laborers, and it is his methods that have invited to our shores the so rallod pauper labor of Europe, until the whole country is over run with men wiio most work at some price, or starve. 1)# mantling protection for himself against coin petition, bu has cunningly managed to bring laborers into competition with each other to an extent that has sent a thrill of alarm throughout the entire country. Talk aboat our tariff laws “pro tecting labor.” A more outrageous hum bug was never advocated, nor has there ever been an iniquity perpetrated by the aid and sanction of law (hat has surpass ed that in operation in America to day.

I’AKTV WIDE OI’K.V. The message of President Cleveland is unqualifiedly endorsed by the Chicago Tribune. Ex Congressman Washburne, ot Minneapolis, and Governor McGill, of Minnesota, also endorse it. A legion of lessor republican lights yro sounding its praises and it looks very much as though it would be the rock upon which the g. o. p. would split wide open and sink out of sight as quickly and unceremoniously as did the old whig party. Noting this re sult of Mr. Cleveland's message the New York Evening Post says: “The most immediate end striking effect of the president's message is the split which it has caused in the republican party. It is a wedge which sinks deep into a crack that has long been widening be tween the high tariff and the low tariff elements in the party. Oar political his tory does not furnish an instance where a deliverance by the head of one party has commanded such hearty praise from lending representatives of the other ns Mr. Cleveland's message has drawn from republican politicians. And if Mr. Cleve land’s message was the wedge, Mr. Blaine's interview was the mallet which is driving it still deeper into the republi can party. There was no stronger advo cate of the republican candidate in 188-t than the Chicago Tribune, but the Chi cago Tribune now says that ‘Mr. Blaine's general position will not commend itself to the American people,’ ‘that it is the weakest ground Mr. Blaine has ever yet occupied,’ and that ‘no national party can expect to go into a presidential cam paign on that issue, no matter who may be its leaders, and win.’ ” roiJTICAI. 

OHBKK VAT IONS Hudson Republican: The gubernator ial contest on the republican side seems to lie between Taylor and MeFstridge. Guenther has withdrawn and Giaty’s bub ble has burst by the Sawyer Spoomer in lluenee goiug for Taylor, and the Husk and Milwaukee crowd going for MeFet ridge. Chippewa Time*; Speaker Tom Mills,of Black River Falls, passed through the city last week. Us was on his way to Lake Superior, where he has invested largely in property, especially at Duluth and West Superior. Whan questioned regarding the coming gubernatorial contest ke was very reticent. He had a good word for all the candidates, but the convention was too far off to predict who would car ry off the pr’zo. The Samuel J. Randall club, the prin cipal democratic organization in Alle gheny county, Pennyslvanin, have unani mously passed resolutions endorsing President Cleveland’s message. The reso lutions commend him for the “plain straightforward statement of the danger impending from the enormous surplus in the national treasury, and in the wise and prudent course pointed out for remedying the evil.” Carry the news to Mr. Randall. The republican national cowunitUe seems to be a Blaine crowd. The execu tive committee elected to arrange for the Chicago convention are Jonesof Penn sylvania, Fessenden of Connecticut, Clarkso.i of lows, Ltland of Kansas, liowo of Nebraska, Conger of Ohio, Clayton of Arkansas, Coney of Texas, and Hobart of New Jersey. Eight of these nine men are active partisans of Mr. Blaine. Mr. Conger of Ohio voted for Blaine and against Sherman in the lust convention, but this year says he will support Sherman because it has been agreed by the Blaine men in Ohio that the candidate from that state should have the support ot the eolid delegation as long as there is any chance for his nom iuation. Therefore the convention will be in charge of a practically solid Blaine committee, who are ardent and active enough to make it pretty certain that any other candidate will have no advantage in the preliminary preparations. Neither lllinoie, Wisconsin. Michigan, nor Indi ana is represented. Ur. New of Indian apolis would have been a most valnable man on the committee, from his experi ence last year. The reason those gentle- VOL.

No case has been established against Wilson, Grevey’s son-in-law, in connection with the decoration scandal and the chargee against him have been dropped. Tu* Charleston, 8.

Ills not improbable that the New York Legislators will be asked to repeal the Batnrday half-holiday law for banks- Business men vote it an unmitigated nuisance. The pressure of the law is most felt in New York city, business there showing some diminution in pro portion with that of unhampered western cities. Many banks, especially in the eastern part of the state, disregard the law entirely, and it is said that bank em ployes gain nothing by its enforcement. Tun Lehigh Valley coal strikers have appealed to the Philadelphia newspapers for moral assistance in their struggle against the combination of operators. “We only ask an advance of cents a ton for mining,” they say, “while the operators are getting from consumers an advance of $1.60 or more a ton.” It is a ad slate of affairs —unprincipled com bination and greed on the one hand and miserable wages and wide-spread distress on the other. The operator# say they are trying to break up the labor rings among their men, and yet everybody knows that they themselves are, and long have been, united in one of the most un scrupulous and despotic rings in the couatry. They now refuse a just demand on the part of the miners, and yet do not hesitate to add dollars a ton to the pric es of their coal, thus causing great dis tress not alone among the miners, who are said to be virtually starving, but among the poor of the cities. Sadi-Cabnot. the new president of the French republic, belongs to a family of traditional quality and importance. His grandfather was the famous Carnat of the French revolution, who tried to stem the power of Robespierre, but who after the reign of terror was wrongfully ao' cased of treason and subsequently be came one of Napoleon's generals. Sadi- Carnot's father sat in the Corps Legisla tive in 1863, and in the Rational Assem bly of 1871. The now president, when called out by the people pressing upon his residence Saturday night, said: “I beg you to prove by your calm demeanor and regard for order that yon are in truth to have a republican government. This is qnite in line with the moderate republicanism which he has professed for many years. He would be called a Gambettist republican, and unless he is dragged from the course to which tem perament and party affiliations would naturally lead him, the Clemenceau radi cals, who precipitated the crisis, will not have gained much by the change. Car not’s announcement yesterday, that when the new ministry was formed he would close the present session of Parliament until, after the senatorial elections, will add to the good impression his election has made. We would not think of inviting a libel suit by charging that the forged letters sent from Berlin to St. Petersburg, pur porting o have been written by Prince Bismarck, were concocted in Russia. The common story is that the letters were the work either of the Orleans family or of intriguers at Berlin. St. Petersburg famishes a much more fruitful field for a search. The recent visit of the czar to Berlin was as near a journey to a politi cal t'anossa as this generation has wit nessed. It was a humiliating trip from beginning to end. and if there had been no incident to relieve the oppression of a forced and artificial welcome to a mon arch, the czar of all the Rnssias would have been compelled to return the laugh ing stock of Europe. But while the czar and the prince conversed an incident did I occur to relieve the situation—the knowl edge of forged letters from Bismarck ex pressing hostility to Russia. The last : fortnight has been taken up with the ef fort to trace these letters to their source. : The speculators all eoem to overlook the fact that no reconciliation has taken place between the czar and Bismarck since their interview. Upon the other hand every day brings fresh particulars about I the military movements on the Russian frontier. This hostile activity may all : be inspired for moral effect, but it shows plainly that the forged latter incident has not produced its full effect. The czar has blundered, and he is sure to continue blundering so long as he acts as an ob structionist in Bulgarian affairs. lowa County Democrat.

The Republican journals advocate a policy of appeasement and concentra tion. The Conservative papers doubt that such a policy would be a lasting suc cess.

Bragg has finally, admitted that he wants to go to Mexico. He desires and will accept, if tendered him by President Cleveland,s the appointment as minister to Mexico. This announcement is made on the authority of three prominent democrats, two of whom have met aud conversed with the general in regard to the matter, since last Saturday and the other of whom has received a letter from him to the above effect. The general says .his health , is such that he believes a sojourn in that country will improve his physical condition, and give his eye which has been tronbiing him, such rest as may restore it permanently. General Bragg arrived in the city to day, and in reply to a direct question as to whether he is an applicant for the mis sion said: “The president has the office in his gift; he knows my position, and I can see no good reason fer making the whole world my father-confessor. On second thought, however, I don’t mind repeating what I have already stated in several letters. The position would be a pleasant one to have for a few years’ rest, after a life of hard work, aud it is for that reason that I would take it. Of course, a foreign mission would be an honor, but at my time of life rest is the main consideration. I see some of the eastern papers say that I need the office. I don’t need any office except a law office, when it comes to a matter of necessity.” The most intimate friends of Cel. Vilas are the most active Bragg boomers, and they are assured that Vilas will per sonally take charge of the matter and urge Bragg’s appointmout. “There'll be no more trouble in the democratic ranks —the Bragg and Vilas factions give way to democracy,” said an enthusiastic dem ocrat this afternoon.

CONGRESSIONAL PLUM. La Follette Will Have Hard Fighting if He Plucks It Again. Monboe, Wis., Dec., 13. —The congres sional pot in this, the third congressional district, is already warming np, and will boon be at the boiling point. J. B. Treat will be a republican candidate f jr the con gressional nomination iu the next con vention and his supporters are sanguine of success. He made a good fight for the nomination a year ago and it is thought he will be more strongly backed now than then. Mr. Treat’s friends fael that two terms are as mnch as Mr. R. M. La Toi lette has any right to expect. Philo A. Orton, of Darlington, brother of Associate Justice Orton of the state supreme bench, and who is otherwise in fluentially connected, will, it is thought, be a candidate also, but odds are against him. The republicans feel that one so recently converted to republicanism from the democracy should not so soon be ele vated to a seat in congress. They want to be oeitain that he is thoroughly con verted. It is hardly believed here that Orton stands much of a show of success the conviction being that the contest will in the end be between La Follette aud Treat. PROF. SWENSON’S PATENT.

The commissioner fur ther says he has suggested to the attorney general that a salt be instituted to per petually enjoin Prof. Swenson from mak ing use of his patent. HOPKINS AFTER HARPER His Trial Beenn—Ths Jury Sworn ln--What the Sides Will try to Prove. Cincinnati, Dec. 13. —In the United States court to-day, Ben Hopkins, cashier of the defunct Fidelity bank, was put on trial. He was accompanied by his son Charles, and his .two daughters Mrs. O’Keefe and Mrs.'Nelson. Hopkins looked pale. He entered a plea of not guilty. The selection of the jury was accom plished and sworn in before the noon adjournment.

Bateman, for the defense, said that they would prove that the de fendant was not aware of what was being dona in the bank, and that he signed the improper drafts when handed to him with others, by Harper, not knowing their nature. Frank Armstrong, of Cincinnati, and John P. Snodgrass, of Chicago, brokers, testified to the large deals in wheat made by them for Hopkins. Hopkins told them the deals were made on account of another party who was “strong” finan cially. Ha did not divulge his principal's name.

They met on a horse car. “Oh, Marne, I have the funniest thing to tell yon!” “No,” said Mame. “Yes, indeed; it’s just too awfully funny for anything!” “Do tell me!” “Yon’U not te.l if I do?” “Oh, no—never!” “Ou, indeed you mustn’t. Tom Dilli ker told it to me.” “He did?” “Yon know Tomf” “Oh, yes—like a book.” “Isn’t he splendid?” “Yes, I guess so —but what did he say?” “Well I’ll tell you. We were going down Broadway looking at all the things in the windows, and —h, aren’t the win dows just lovely now! Did you ever sue anything lovelier than the now fall hats?” “Ob, they're just beautiful! I think I'll get a high crowned —but what did Tom say f” “Oh, it was the fnnmiest thing.

I just rave over diamonds. But what was I talking about? Oh, about what Tom said. I declare, it was the funniest thing. I’ve laughed about it ever since. Isn’t he awfully jolly, anyhow?” “Ob, yes; I guess so —but what did he say TANARUS” Well, we had just met Sadie Meech— and did you know that she was engaged to that elegant Mr. Whyte we saw her with last winter?” “Is she?” “They say it’s Irae. I never would have believed it. And isn't it funny that Kate Bartlett is to marry Fred Masterson? Tom said —oh, I was going to tell you about Tom’s bit of fun.” “Yes, what was it?” “Well, after Belle passed we met the Stephenson girls, and—did you know that both of them became engaged at Bar Harbor this summer?” “No-o-o-o!” “It’s true.

It was the funniest thing!” RAILROAD LAND GRANTS. An Important Opinion by Attorney General Garland. An important opinion by Attorney Gen eral Garland relative to the adjustment of railroad land grants under the act of March 3, 1887, was made public recently. Secretary Lamar submitted several ques tions to Mr. Garland with reference to bona fide purchasers of unclaimed lands, the rights of such purchasers to lands legally or illegally patented to railroads being also involved. Attorney General Garland strongly emphasizes the remedi al scope of the act referred to and says the intent of certain sections is to relieve from loss settlers and Donafide purchas ers who through the erroneous or wrong ful disposition of the lands in the grants, by the offices of the government or b; the railroads, have lost theii rights or acquired equities, which in justice should be recognized. Furthermore, the whole remedial part was passed with a recogni tion of the fact that the railroad com panies bad sold lands to which they had no just claim. Upon receipt of the opin ion Secretary Lamar directed the com missioner of the general land office to proceed at once and with as much dis patch as possible to adjust all land grants under the act of March 3, 1887. His in structions to the commissioner are mi nute a* to details and are in aoeordanee with the views of the attorney genersL NO. 10. JULES FERRY SHOT. AtteU|)tpi;Mardor of an Ex-Premier of f ranee in the Clifiinlior of IK'put ip*. Hi roc Bullets Fired by a Revolution ist Without Serious Results, Ferry Shot by an Assassin. A NARROW ESC APB. I'abis, Dec. 10. —M. Jules Ferry was fired at three times Saturday afternoon by a man in the lobby #f the chamber of deputies. The shots were fired by a mau named Anbettin. Aubertin appeared in the chamber of deputies and asked to see M. Ferry and M. Goblet. M. Goblet did not respond to Anbertin's request for an interview, but M. terry did, and on his appearance Aubertin drew a revolver and fired three times at him. Mr. Ferry was able to proceed to a hospital supported by friends. In reply to by frieads as to the severity of his wound, he responded, “It is noth ing.” A medical examination at the hospital revealed that two of the bullets strnck M. Ferry. The first pasted around the chest, slightly penetrating the flesh, and the second struck M. Ferry on the right side near the lowest ribs, causing a con tnsion. The thigh was not penetrated. M. Ferry’s wounds are of the slightest character. After his injuries had been attended to at the hospital Al. Ferry returned to his home on foot. A bulletin issued by Dr. Trelat states that the wound in M. Ferry’s chest is a contusion. Aubertin was immediately arrested. The bystanders tried to lynch Anbertiu after he had fired the shots, but were with difficulty prevented from carrying ,ont their intention. Aubertin is 20 years of age. Us states that he is one of the band of revolution ists. The band drew lots, and it fell to him to commit the first crime. Aubet tin declares that ho swore to kill M. Ferry. INTENDS!) TO Elm. GOBLET. M. Ferry’s assailant was accompanied by an accomplice, who was to have shot M. Goblet, but who funked, giving as his reason that his revolver dropped to the floor. When Aubertin was searched by the police a paper was found on him which indicated that he and his confederates had drawn lots yesterday to decide who should do the shooting. The paper reads: “Death to intriguers. Our path is marked out to form an intelligent, dis interested, and patriot!* ministry. So be it!” BCDFFLEB IN THE CHAM BEK, In consequence of the attempt upon the life of M. Ferry there were many heated quarrels in the lobby of the cham ber of deputies between moderates and radicals. M. Ronvier joined in the dis cussion, accusing the radicals of provok ing weak-minded persons to deeds of violence. Several senffies ensued, and it is expected they will lead to duels. li ENEKAL NEWS NOTES. Gonrock Bay is to be the winter quar ters of the Thistle.
