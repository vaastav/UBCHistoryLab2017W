Fire broke out in the King Theatre this evening just as the curtain rose on the opera. There were upward of two thousand persons in the audience, and when the flames burst around the &&ge On which were two hundred actors, a tremen dous rush was made from all parts of the house in order to escape. Many of the pan. ie-stricken people leaped' from the windows, while the shouts and shrieks of those who weie unable to make their escape were heart rending. During the greatest excitement the gas metre connected with the theatre ex ploded, thereby causing total darkness. At midnight three hundred dead bodies had been recovered and several hundred more were yet left in the building, which was still wrapped in names. IjAtee. it is now estimated that the loss of life is upward of five hundred. THE NATIONAL CAPITAL. Knocking Down Gulteau's Insanity Flea Strong Testimony in Favor or Hi. Sanity His Relatives Going Back on Him President Arthur'. Answer to Seoville'. Hnerie.. Washington, Deo. 8. The proceedings of ; the past few days have had a perceptible ef fect and are showing in the court room. In the talk among lawyers, reporters and the regular attendants one finds a distinctly un favorable turn for the defense, and the pris oner himself seems to feel it. The rebutting testimony brought in yesterday by the prose cution was very strong. A succession of solid business men of Freeport gave evidence as to the ability, intelligence and sanity of Luther Ouiteau and of the family in general, and Mr. Scoville's effo.rts to break down the force of this testimony were of small avail. The turn in the tide, if so it may be called, has given a new interest to the case, and there is greater eagerness than ever to hear the expert testimony to be introduced by the government. This morning every foot of space in the court room was taken, long be fore 10 o'olock, by a throng of most intelligent-looking people. Tne first witness m rebuttal was Mrs. J una M. Wilson, of Leadville, Col., a niece of Luther W. -Guiteau. She recollected her uncle, Julius Ouiteau, and that he died of consumption. She said: "My mother was a lovely Christian woman, small of stature, and inherited a tendenoy to pulmonary dis ease ; she died of pneumonia in 1856 ; she never exhibited any symptoms of mental de rangement." In regard to the testimony of Mr. Davis, for the defence, that her mother exhibited symptoms of insanity, she said she never heard her mother say the erratic things ascribed to her. The witness1 sister Abby was in her right mind until ten years old, when she fell under the influence of mesmer ism ; a practitioner of this art would put her into a cataleptic state, and others could con trol her will very easily ; her parents for bade the exercise of tms power upon her ; afterward the vigor and integrity of her mind seemed somewhat impaired. Witness did not know this man Davis. In regard to her mother, again, witness described herself as having been her mother's confidante and nurse. Witness failed to corroborate the testimony of Mr. Turner for the defence in re gard to the insanity of her aunt, Mrs. Parker. She spoke of her sister Abby as "weak-minded or not very bright, perhaps, " her trouble ncreasing with advancing years, so that at last she was placed in the insane asylum at Kalamazoo, and afterward at Fontiac, Mich., where she now is. witness visited her there two years ago and found her as one having a child's mind in an old body, and gave illus trations of her innocent and pathetic child ishness. , Witness bore testimony to the san ity of various members of the Guiteau fam ily with whom she had b6en acquainted, harmonizing with the statements made by Freeport citizens yesterday. She did not re member tbe mental peculiarities of Grandma Guiteau. In regard to her sister Abby again witness said she had stopped her on the street by simply raising her finger when half a block distant, and her father could do the same ; the bent of Abby's mind was toward matrimony instead of religion. John Guiteau, brother of the prisoner, de siring that statements in regard to the mental affection of his uncle, Mr. Maynard, should be stricken out, both Mr. Scoville and his client protested against his interference, and the latter violently repudiated him. ' George V. Maynard, cousin of Mrs. Wilson. who was a daughter of - Guiteau 's father's brother, was next called. He 'testified in a line with the other witnesses for the re buttal in regard to the characteristics of the Guiteau family. One of the jurors being indisposed the court then took a recess for an hour. The afternoon session opened by calling Mr. Frank Bartlett. The prisoner interrupted to charge Mr. Corkhill with wasting $200 of the government's money in bringing on this witness. Witnesst eetifled that he met the prisoner at Mr.Bcoville s country seat in 1878, where, 111 company with the prisoner and others, he amused himielf with a tub on the lake. The prisoner took his ducking in good art when it oame, and witness saw nothing in his conversation or conduct tnat lnaicatea insanity, (iuiteau here shout ed : "That's got nothing to do with what occurred last May and June. I might have gone crazy a dozen times sinoe he saw me." Mrs. Florence R. Bartlett was' next questioned in regard to incidents at the same' place. She related the dog story referred to In Mr. Burrows' testimony, showing it to have been a trivial affair in all respects; She related an incident about boating in connection with the prisoner, and a card party in which he par ticipated. 8he never saw anything in the prisoners' woras or conduct tnat indicated insanity. - Howard C. Dunham, of Boston, was called. "Ibis man doesn't know much about me." interrupted the prisoner. "He thought I was badly cranked about my Dook. ne looked upon it as a literary curiosity." Witness told about the prisoner engaging an office in Boston, stating that he would abandon theology, and get out cards announcing himself as a counsellor and attorney-at-law. "Theology," the prisoner said to him, "did not pay." Mr. Scoville objected to-evidence being introduced at this stage as to the sanity or insanity of tbe prisoner. He claimed that such testimony should have been introduced in chief. The court "I overrule the objection. It is not worth while to so into particulars now." Mr. Soo- vule "Then I would like an exception entered against any testimony offered on the part of the pros ecution tending to show the insanity of the prison er." Witness did not regard the prisoner as Insane. The prisoner "Witness was a Methodist minister and be did not like my theology. Besides I had no money then and he did not like my style." (Laugh ter.) Witness, continuing, said he had had conversa tion with John W, Ouiteau, who remarked that there was no well authenticated case of insanity in the Ouiteau family. The prisoner, (excitedly! ''My brother has a miserable opinion that it would be a disgrace to the Ouiteau family to prove that any member was insane." Witness said he did not re member John- Ouiteau saying he would rather see the prfeoner hung than have insanity proved. The prisoner iwo ox my cousins are in a ranatio asy mm, and probably I will be In one soon." (Laugh ter). Corkhill presented a communication from President Artnur in answer to the Interrogations or the defense. The document was not read but submitted to Mr. Scoville for examination. John Farmer, of Saratoga Spring., was the next witness, xtexore ne was questioned tne prisoner said, "I owe this man S10 for board. It cost the govern ment $100 to bring him here. I might have admitted uii. i act ana spared this expense to the nation." wit ness related the dimcnlty he had in -collecting his board bill from the prisoner. Meantime Ouiteau had read President Arthur's an swer to Mr. Scoville'. questions and declared in an emphatic manner that they should be published at once. The document was then, read by Mr. Scoville. The first ' question was "Do you know the priamer in this case ?" President Arthur answered in the affirmative.' He hadse him ten or probably twenty time, around the Repub lican neaaqnarters in tne jnrtn Avenue novel in new York, but had had no conversation with him except in returning the ordinary salutations of the day. "What political aerviee did the prisoner render the Republican party during the last campaign 7" was the nexr interrogation. ".Hone tnav i know or, me President wrote in response, "and I don't know that there was anything in his relations to myself, General urans or nenator conzling tnat would entitle mm xo believe we would assist in bis political preferment." The prisoner "That is a matter of opinion." The President added by way of postscript that he had re ceived a letter from the prisoner asking for the post ponement of hi. trial in order to allow him to pre pare for his defense. Rev. B. S. McArthur. pastor of the Calvary Baptist church in New York, was then called. He testified that the prisoner brought letters of dismission to him from a Chicago church. Ouiteau complained of pov erty resulting from the Chicago fire and the witness' heart went out towards him and he loaned him $95. '1 here was nothing in the prisoners manner to indi cate insanity. Ouiteau became very excited during the testimony, and while admitting that be borrowed the money oorrected. witness as to the manner in which it was borrowed. Witness explained that the prisoner's wife represented to him that herself and husband would be placed7 on the sidewalk if they could not raise a little money, xne prisoner was ex. pasting to get the Austrian ministry at that time. "No," said Ouiteau. "it was the Swiss mission I was expecting. That, however, did not amount to much. It was enly $5,000 a year." Witness then stated that the prisoner was brought up before a committee of the church in regard to certain immoral conduct. Hie wife claimed that she supplied him with money which he spent with other women. The prisoner again became excited, Mating' that hi. conduct was prompted by a desire to procure sufficient ground for divorce from a woman whom he married in ten hours' notice. After considerable discussion between witness, prisoner and the prosecuting counsel on this pointMr. Corkill said "the government intended to snow tnac wnat was claimed to oe insanity uu un part of the prisoner ws. nothing but outrageous de pravity." This remark was loudly applauded by the audience. A young man who started the demonstra tion was put out by one or tne omcer. oz tne court. Witness in answer toother question, said he never regarded Ouiteau as insane. The prisoner acted very wildly during this portion, explaining that Dr. Mc Arthur was evidently mistaken in his conclusion, that be waa a good man and a fine speaker, but should not be so reckless in his statements "I have been strictly virtuous for six years," he shouted, "and there is no reason why this testimony should be pre sented to the court. " The court adjourned at S o'clock until to-morrow. when the examination of Mr. McArthur will be re sumed. Ralph Wormley, the colored juror, was so unwell this morning as to require medical attendance. Dr. Townshend visited him and pronounced it a case of dyspepsia. The Senate Committee. A Partial Reor ganization of. the Republican Chair manship. More Cabinet Rumors Other Matter.. Washtsgton, Dec. 8. Messrs. Hoar, Alli son, Edmunds, Flumb, Bill, Cole and Win dom of the sub-committee of the Senate Re publican caucus committee held a meeting of over three hours duration after adjournment- to-day to consider the reorganization of the Republican element of the standing and se lect committees. There is, including Ma hone, 39 Senators and but 33 committee chairmanships to be distributed among them By changes which have occurred since last organized.. Mr. Edmunds has two important committees, the Judiciary and Foreign Rela tions ; McMillan the Commerce and Revision of Laws, and Rollins Public Buildings and Grounds and Enrolled isulfl, while Messrs. McDill, Mfller'of California, Vanwick, Sew ell, Miller of New York, Lapham, Aldrich and Windom have none. The last four are juniors, coming in since the beginning of the session, and under the practice of the Senate the three committees go to older Senators. The positions of Senators Sherman and Windom on the committees of the Senate give them some claims not strictly recognized by the usages of the Senate, but sufficient to make the reconstruction a difficult and deli cate task. The sub-committee did not reach a conclusion, but adjourned for the' purpose of consultation with other benators. It is understood that to assist in harmonizing mat ters Mr. Allison, who is chairman of the Ap propriations committee, volunteered to sur render his place on the Finance committee to Windom. It may be some days before the matter will be definitely arranged, and if any material changes be decided on the Democrats may wish to make some changes on their side. A great many members left the city this evening. The House will adjourn to Tuesday soon after coming together to-morrow. The Treasury department has received no tice that a five dollar counterfeit note on the Boylston National bank Boston, is in circula tion. The face of the note is good and the pink seal and the figures excellent, but the green border and the ends on the back are badly engraved. Tne istate arms and eagle in the right oval are badly engraved. A pen made counterfeit of the $10 silver certificate is also afloat. The lady of the White House will be Mrs. John Davis, a daughter of ex-Senator and future Seeretary of State Frelinghuysen, and the wife of president Artnur's private secre tary.

The impression prevails here tnat secre tary of the Interior Kirkwood will retain his position in Arthur's Cabinet. It has been based on the fact that he was supported by the united Iowa delegation and by prominent western Republicans. It received new force by the discovery to-day that Kirkwood had renewed the lease upon his Capitol Hill house for a year, that fact having been accepted as conclusive evidence that he will remain where he is.

PENNSYLVANIA. The Crusade Against Deathbed Insur- Haeeisbcbg, Deo. 8. Deputy Attorney General Gilbert, representing the State In surance Commissioner, to-day made applica tion in court for warrants for the arrest of the officers of the State Capital Mutual Aid association, one of the prominent deathbed companies, on a charge of conspiracy. The request was made for the double purpose of prosecuting the officers criminally and to se cure possession of the books of the com pany. Sometime ago application was made for a writ of quo warranto against the con cern which has not yet been argued. Gil bert states that he had reason to believe the books of" the company were now being doctored that they may appear all right when examined by the court on quo warranto proceeding. To prevent this a charge of conspiracy has been brought that the books and papers may be placed in charge of the court and kept secure. The court after consultation late this afternoon refused to issue warrants on the ground that it cannot act as a committing magistrate. A motion was then made by Gilbert that the association be dissolved, upon which argu ment will take place next weeK. Colonel Forney In a Dying State. Phxladelhhia, Dec. ,8.

The week before last while on a visit to Washing ton he took a severe cold and was advised by friends to return home at once, but urgent business compelled his presence in New York, and when he reached this city it was apparent that he was not in his usual good neaitn. tie Kept Draveiy at worn, nowever, in the editorial chair of 'Progress until last Wednesday week, when his strength left him and he was completely prostrated.

Symptoms of Bright'a disease of the kindeys began however, to manifest themselves and despite all efforts, of his physician he gradually sank. Up to Wednesday he retained consciousness and perused the papers, but on the evening of that day fell into a comatose state. At noon Dr. Gethell informed the family that his patient had reached a stage at which re covery was out of the question.

Illinois. - A New Revelation About Guiteau. Chicago, Dec. 8. The Inter-Ocean to day publishes the following : "Several things have transpired here within the last few days which show that Guiteau had for a long time contemplated doing something which would, in his estimation, immortalize him. More than two years ago he made the acquaintance here of H. P. Porter, who is in business at No. 99 State street. He then told him that he intended to go to Washington and create a stir which would make his name famous all over the world. A reporter questioned Mr. Por ter on Tuesday in regard to his father. He replied that he became acquainted with Guiteau several years ago. On one occasion he employed Guiteau for a friend at the Ar mory Police Court. He, however, kept up no close acquaintance with him. At another time Guiteau came to him and solicited business, but Porter was in no need of legal service ana naa no particular desire to culti vate Guiteau's friendship. Guiteau then passed from his recollection, the same as many people had. . It was not until the assassination of the President that Porter again thought of Guiteau, who would have escaped from his recollection entirely if he had not recognized him from likenesses or cuts in the papers. Porter, feeling that it was his duty to inform some responsible person of whatjheknew about Guiteau, called on Mr. E. S. Isham, who heard his story. After the death of President Garfield he made a second call on Mr. Isham and repeated his story, the material points, of which he said had been sent to the proper authorities. He had not since heard anything about it, and did not know whether any use had or would be made of it. The Mr. Isham referred to is a prominent lawyer of this city. " NEW
