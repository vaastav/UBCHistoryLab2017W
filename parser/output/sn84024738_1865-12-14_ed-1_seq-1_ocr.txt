SOUTHERN REWII«ENTATfON~THE I.A --1 TEXT NEW* PROW WASHINGTON. j We had prepared tor yesterday's paper■ an interesting return* of the opinions and specujla- I tiona current in Washington city on this, shb i jut, but the article waa unfortunately omit ted. We allude to it now merely>as affording us a reason for stating to-day thai* Senator Doolittle, of Wisconsin ; Hon. H. J. Ray mond, of New York city, Mr. Seward's right hand man, and Horace Greeley, all of them great lights of the Republican party, seen, to jbe strongly disposed to .sustain the President In his reconstruction policy, and that the Conservatives are flushed with the hope that the consequence must be either the admission of the .Southern members who can take the > oath or & disruption of the Radical party ; I for it is certain that such men must control , many of less note. Below we give all the paragraphs from Our latest which are calculated to 1 throw any light upon the question. *|he i Baltimore SriSa correspondence contains the following : I "The Thaddeus Stevens resolution pro scribing eleven States of the Union from rtnv participation in the affairs of the Union for ian indefinite period of time met with vigor ous opposition to-day in the Senate upon the proposition to amend the same, as agreed upon <in caucus, so as to prevent the exclusion of representatives from such States. Senator Poo little argued that the passage of the resolu -1 tion would accomplish what th«* people of tho , eleven late insurgent Suites, with an immense sacrifice of life, had failed to do—to dissolve | the Union. The resolution was so amended as |to leave each body at any time to admit mem bers from any States not now represented. , " Whether the recent victory of the Con servatives in the Senate caucus" shall turn to r 'Dead Sea fruits' depends upon their own course. They might be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. Under the last Adminis tration, to sat' aught against its acts was trea son, more or less. But now men of the worst stamp in Congress must be tolerated in the most violent concerted schemes against An-' drew Johnson. But imperturable and persist ent advocacy of right and reason must pre vail. Such, doubtless, will be the President's course. The slow and sure, in time, get on. The stake is too great for Intemperate action. Good men must be hopeful and firm. *• The Senate passed to-day the House joint j resolution for a committee of fifteen on recon -1 struction, just as it was agreed on in the Sena torial caucus on yesterday, and published in i the Sun this morning. All of the Democratic Senators voted against it, as well as two Re ! publicans, Messrs. Dixon, of Connecticut, and Doolittle, of Wisconsin. The latter, in a speech of considerable force, said the original House j resolution proposed to dissolve the Union by law. The indications are decided that the i House will accept the modification of their i resolution as agreed on in the Senate/ Tb* National Intelligencer says: "The action of Congress yesterday is of much interest, Mai its indications are rather hopeful that the j I sturdy blows aimed by Mr. Stevens against the President's policy will, in their reaction, i ! prove useful in the accomplishment of the pa- j ] triotic purposes of the Executive. The speech of Senator Doolittle is full of force and digni- ' ty. It marches tip to the points with power, ; moderation and decision. It vindicates the President and his policy in a manner worthy Of the theme. The portrait which the honor- j able Senator draws of the rigid political lea tunas of the Honorable Thaddeus Stevens is so true to the life that the best friends of that distinguished gentleman cannot be offended at the likeness. " In the House it is gratifying to note that ! the chains of caucus are slacking, if not break- i ing. Hon. Henry J. Raymond expressed him- ' sehf —jail personally in favor of referring ereden- j tiaaa to the Committee am Elections; but that,! "out of deference to the views of members, he would move their reference to the Select < Committee on the subject of the so-called Con federate States.'' The subsequent action of the House, under the previous question, how ever, indicates conclusively that the " Select j Committee " is the pet of the majority; and yet we are not without hope, from the indica tions named, that the fair and open thing will prevail in some form." The Chronicle, Mr. Forney's paper, gives signs that it foresees the result desired by ' the Conservatives. It says : "We note these manifestations as bearing | particularly upon the question of restoration, j and as appropriate responses to the spirit of i the President's message, who gracefully re- j ferred to Congress the whole controversy in- j volved in these particular applications for seats in the National Legislature. That there | is a strong prevailing anxiety to see good and j true men from the South in Congress, it did j not need these indications to prove." f.eortcia. Milledokvii.i.e, Ga., December 11.—The Senate has passed a bill regulating contracts between master anil servant. If for over one mouth it must be in writing ; work hours to j be from sunrise to sunset, and servants to be . responsible for damaging the muster's proper- j ly ; wages forfeited by leaving before expira tion of contract. The employer may discharge for disobedience, drunkenness, immorality, want of respect, or for leaving service ; en- ; titiug servants away, misdemeanors to be punishable with a fine of $*», or imprisonment foe four months. j The House refused to consider the resolution fixing a day for the election of United States Senators by a vote of ninety to fifty-six. Provisional Governor Johnson sent a tele gram. la*t night to Washington, asking to be j relieved, and asking that the Governor elect, ; Jenkins, be allowed to take his office. Flock to Rio Ds Janeiro.—We learn from the New Orleans timtt that a vessel is on the way from Rio de Janeiro to that city with a cargo of cofl'ee. The arrival of such a cargo will remind the people of the Crescent City, says that paper, of the former prosperity of 1 their city. From the year 1535 to«he year ls«o the imports of coffee direct from Kio into j New Orleans were two million one hundred ! aud fifteen thousand six hundred^,nd ninety seven sacks, or three hundred and fifty-two j thousand six hundred and sixteen sacks per ! annum, reaching in the year IM7 four hun dred and twenty-seven thousand three hun shred and twenty-three. This would be worth, i adds the Timet*, to the trade of New Orleans, j "at this time, taking th«* average quantity as a • standard, twenty-one cents per pound, in gold, I 'or nearly twelve millions of dollars. The Haass ' 1 hopes that a cargo of Hour will be in readiness for the coffee ship, with which to return at. I ; once. . j i The Rio people prefer Richmond flonr to any j i other, and we hope soon to hear of a cargo of J j coffee on its way to this city, to be exchanged j for our flonr. It would serve as a reminder, ' \ here too, of the profitable trade formerly car- I : ried on between Richmond and Rio. Choi hka Abati.m*.—The State Department has received a very able communication from , ! Mr. Alexander W. Thayer, United-States Con- j i sul at Trieste, dated November IS, ls«.i, iv ' | which he states that the Central Sanitary ! ( Commission of that city had voted to report j i it as their unanimous opinion that the disease . , did not exist in an epidemic form. Mr. Thayer ! states that, since the 2Sd of October, although I ! the number of cases have Increased, they do i i not average three per day, and that no fears j j need be entertained that the cholera will be I iin trod need into the United States .from j Trieste. During the war, a gentleman, from near j Fredericksburg, purchased a farm in Chester field county for $25,000 in Confederate money. > He has recently made some observations as to j the character of the land, aud discovered coal. 1 He has since been offered $20,000 in greenbacks | 1 for his farm, but refused to take the amount i . unless paid in gold. The New York Tribune finds in the fre- i Siueney of railroad massacres a justification or coin lug the new word viairiaUie, derived i from viator, a traveler. 1
