Among the criticisms passed upon the message, the most unreasonable is that which censures the president for not hav ing outlined a'-dcffnlte "Philippine policy." The United States will not have a legal title to the Philippine islands until the treaty of Paris Is signed by the joint com mission of this country and Spain and rat ified by the senate and the cortez. Until such title is secured it would be prema ture to make positive recommendations. There is no doubt but that the president's, mind is fully made up as'to the' form cf' government that should' be "adopted for the Philippines and that he will lose no time in presenting his views when the appro- prlate occasion presents lttulf. Pending tlje proper time the 'military 'government now In existence will be continued, and on that point there is no obscurity In the message. Singularly enough."'the, EngMsn press Iihs accepted this omission in the message as a matter of course, while here at home where it .should be even better understood it Is made the subject of ad verse criticism. In some Instances among senators and representative? who, above all others, should sec the Impropriety of anticlatlng the TariH treaty. 

OFFICIAL DISHONESTY. The Cross case and the Gillett case both emphasize the fact that, after all due credit has been given to the protection afforded by systems of checks and counter-checks, the ultimate strength of a business hangs on the quality of the manhood of the man nt the head. The failures of the Cross bank and of the operations of the cattle kins were each the result, not of faulty system,, but of the deterioration of the moral tiber of one mau.wji occupied a focal position.. It vraa a matter oT the lack of a little old fashioned righteousness. There Is no way' to guard absolutely against official dishonesty. Much may be done toward It by tho multiplication of checks and balances, but! such multiplica tion renders impossible that .dlrecf and frlctlonlcss operation of business machin ery which Is" so necessary "to results and thcreforo so dear to the American" heart, and after all it does, not -make defalcation Impossible; It only diminishes the chance of It. Successful cheatlng-Is not easily done co-operatively, and that Is all that can te eaid. for the most elaborate check ever de vised. The ultimate trust is.the'snme.'be tho system simple or complex; It is-In the honesty of the Individual. Bank directors need to awake to their re sponsibilities, and lenders of money to watch large borrowers. But all those who have to do with the manufacture of citi zens should remember that the main ques tion, after all. Is not ' the detection of rogues, but the production of men whose consciences re-enforce a certain old statute which .reads,-"Thou shalt not steal." i LOWEtt WATER TtATES. The passage of the ordinance making a reduction of 15 percent in water rates to all consumers marks the first fruitful step toward lthe fulfillment of promises made when the vote was taken on the proposition to secure city ownership of the water works plant and service. It is true that In tho meantime the city has been given fire pro tpctlon free of charge, whereas the com pany was paid for Jire service as well as for watcr'supplled private consumers. But the cut just authorized will afford some substantial vindication of the claim that city ownership Is advantageous to consum ers. The reason the reduction has not come sooner Is obvious. Tho original com pany, foreseeing the inevitable loss of the plant to them, allowed machinery and con struction to run down,, so that wlien the city took possession' it was necessary im mediately to put considerable money into repairs and new equipment. These expendi tures have so drawn upon the surplus that It has not been safe to cut the rates here tofore. There Is reason to believe that this Is only the beginning of a series of reduc tions that will Anally result in giving the consumers of Kansas City much cheaper natcr. Such objects are necessarily at tained only by" slow and gradual processes; but with a proiicr administration of the water 'department still further cutting in the rates can be made from time to time as the revenues Increase, and the outlay be comes less through the liquidation of In terest bearing obligations. MiNGTIl OK I'RKMIJKNTIAL- MES SAGES. Whenever a presidential message of un usual length is submitted to congress there Is much newspaper criticism of the tend ency to elaboration In these documents. It Is well for editors as well as readers to remember that the annual message Is writ ten for the purpose of reviewing, events of the year for the enlightenment of congress and the making of recommendations for congressional action, and not for what it may be worth as a newspaper article. The ordinary rules of condemnation maynot be applied to tho state paper as they-are to the news report or the editorial. To some extent tho elaboration and explicltness re quired In the preparation of legal docu ments are necessary In the writing of stite papers. The president of a great demo cratic people should aim to be thorough and comprehensive rather than terse and epi grammatic It Is better that he should re iterate than that he should be ambiguous. Doubtless It Is true that messages would bo read by a larger number of people if they were only half the accustomed length, jet the gain In this respect would be much less than !s generally supposed. Those who" are interested lu suite affairs read messages whether they are short or long, and those who are indifferent to public questions do not read them whether they are long or short. Besides, the primary purpose of the message Is to Inform the chosen representatives of the people, rather than the people themselves. Newspaper en terprise demands the publication of these addresses regardless of length, but their newspaper value is a consideration second ary to their official purpose. 

DOES DEMOCRACY INVITE I'OIM'- LISM ! Mr. Grant Herringtori, editor of a Pop ulist newspaper and member of the Kansas state Populist committee, is out with an editorial in which he declares that free silver, is not enough to carry the Populist organization Into the Democratic party. Financial legislation, he says. Is a. small part of the sum total of Populist desires, and until the Democratic party Is willing to take up and advocate the main prin ciples of Populism there can be no sur render by Populists to that organization. Mr. Hcrrlngton does not leave us in doubt as to what he regards as the "main prin ciples" of Populism. He makes the matter very clear In the following quoted para graph: "A promise of the free coinage of silver will not satisfy Populists. They demand something more than that. The Populist party never has considered the free coin age of silver as the all-important issue before the American people. The logic of events, forced that Jto the. front two year ago. .Populists accepted .It believing that the election of Bryan meant more than free coinage. They believed that with the silver question out of the way and a friend Of the people "like Bryan in the" Whito House that the way was then open for a rapid extension of the doctrines of gov ernment ownership." Mr. Hcrrlngton does not stop with a be lief in government ownership of railroads and great public utilities of that sort. He Is"a, full-fledged socialist and travels the whole road, and there can be no doubt that he speaks for "a. very large element ofjhe Kansas Populist party. Dozens of the best Populist- papers in Kansas are outspoken in their support of socialism, and we find many of them publishing ap "provlngly the Interview lately given to the public by "Warren Foster, Populist candi date for the United States senate In Utah, from which we quote as follows: "With this campaign closes practically the work of the Populist party as such. It has run Its course. The "curtain has fallen. The allow is oyer' "It , 'has done a great work. It has earned the rest that it now takes. Six years of hardships In pioneering tho way for something grander and better Is enough. lt;has been'sbr-ycars of rehear sals for the "big show that Is to come later. While all.seems dead and desurted, and the old-party, orchestra Is lulling "the specta tors to .sleep with such tunes as 'the siren song of-silver" and 'all on account of the tariff' there Is a grand work going on be hind the1" scenes. The 'next attraction will be socialism, which is the big show in fact. Secure youcUekcts before-.,the rush. Pop ulism will move, on to socialism with the same degree of pride-that thrills tho heart when one moves from the "sod shanty' Into the new house. Wo welcome socialism as the fruition of our hopes. We have lost nothing. .Socialism is all of Populism plus more that is wholesome and good. Pop ulists Jiax-e made mistakes, but they would have been more than human If they had not. Instead of quarreling with each other over these mistakes let us profit by them In the future us we move one step higher; one, step nearer to the realization of the goal to which all true, brave men and wom en have been tending. From Peter Cooper grcenbacklsm to the T'nlon Labor party; from the Union Labor party to the Farm ers' Alliance; from the Farmers' Alliance. to Populism; from Populism to socialism the samo great end and aim ever in view. So far all have been but rehearsals, by-plays, and advertising dodges Jor the great show that is coming. The philosopher llnds.no discouragement here. All Is hope." And all of this becomes mightily interest ing in view of the assumption by the Dem ocratic politicians that Populism is to be absorbed Into the Democratic party with out further ado. Undoubtedly the Chi cago convention of 1SSG was largely Influ enced In declaring for free silver by the belief that this would be sufficient to at tract all Populists Into the Democratic or ganization, and for a time the silver decla ration did seem sufficient to accomplish this purpose. But now we find the Popu list party crying for more, and this time it calls upon Democracy to surrender tho one great fundamental principle which has ramified that organization from the time of Thomas Jefferson to tho present day. If Democracy has been true to any ono policy of government it Is to the belief that the government has no business operating in the realm of private affairs. For halt a century Democracy has accused Repub licanism of seeking jto establish such a centralization of government as' first will be paternal and "then autocratic Assum ing this charge to be true, the elements of affinity "would seem to lie between Repub licanism and Populism Instead of between Democracy and Populism, but nevertheless we find Democracy trying to absorb within itself a faction of the people whose chief belief is in the government ownership of everything. More than this, the Populists are calmly assured that Democracy is their natural refuge and that If they ever expect to see their wishes consummated they must quit playing a separate hand and come bodily into the Democratic party. And now the question is. Is Democracy preparing to surrender Its lifelong belief in private ownership, or Is this simply a bunco game played by Democratic poli ticians? 

EDITORIAL NOTES. One 13 surprised to find how much shorter the message Is on reading It than It looked at first glance. Mr. Joaquin Miller, of Klondike, is out on a goldsceking expedition. He Is lecturing In the United States. Talk of an "open door" at this season of the year naturally makes the Hon. Nel son R. Dlnglcy feel a little chilly. The president unfortunately had to pluck his message before it got ripe. The most Interesting part of all was omitted. The advertisers seem to be actuated by a commendable purpose to crowd the war correspondents out of the magazines. It has just been demonstrated In New York that a fireproof skyscraper burns as readily as any other kind of fireproof build ing. The Hon. John W. Leedy still clings to the conviction that the United States su preme court is an untrustworthy institu tion, addicted tq the porcelain bathtub habit. President McKinley first took the Span lards In hand. Then he took his pen In hand. The result Is a big victory and a hlg message on It. In one sense. Mr. Bland Is right in re ferring to free coinage of silver as "the great leading Issue." It has been lead- ing Democratic congressmen into retire ment In every state where the financial question was pushed to the front. Mr. Teller is grieved to find that the president's message contains no promise for silver men. Mr. Teller looks in queer places for sliver promises. Senator Hanna's statement that Ohio has her full share of the offices will be received with pained surprise throughout a certain thriving state of the Union. The retirement of Governor Leedy leaves the country in a wretched condition. Who will compel the supreme court to modify its railroad decisions hereafter? Mr. Carnegie's zeal and activity In op position to national expansion will cause the organized labor Interests to pause and reconsider. They have not forgotten Home stead. Hon. Arkansas Jones sounds the alarm. The president, he says, is trying to intimi date congress. Perhaps the sergeant-at-arms will permit Hon. Arkansas to carry a navy revolver In his belt. Judge Day bluntly tells the Spaniards that anythlrfg can be put into a peace treaty that the victors want there. They learned some days ago that anything can also be kept out of a peace treaty that the victors don't want there. In fact, the making of a peace treaty is largely an ex-parte affair. 

KANSAS TOPICS. We speak elsewhere of a copy of the Hllo (Hawaii) Tribune received by this office. It is a handsome newspaper that would be a credit to any American country town, but it is chiefly interesting as show ing how similar are human habits, am bitions and methods in every part of the habitable globe. The leading editorial is a more or legs bitter denunciation of a faction of politicians who have organized a "McKinley Club." with the alleged pur pose of controlling the appointment of a federal judge. This editorial might have been "written for Kansas or Missouri, and it discloses the phenomenal rapidity with which our political methods have taken root In the distant province. The next ed itorial is one pointing out to local mer chants the necessity of organizing a board of trade, "which must set out at once upon the work of booming the town." The local department opens with an announcement of a place which has just received a large shipment of "the best American beer," and then follows an item urging all those who have a taste for luxuries to buy "some of those frozen Baltimore oysters." The pro prietor of a billiard hall offers a reward for the man who ripped up the cloth on one of his tables, and following this is the an nouncement that a local pastor "has a fine sermon on 'The Ideal Soldier' that he ex pects to fire next Sunday at the New York volunteers." Next comes an account of an excursion given by the citizens to the crew of a United States steamer in which It Is proudly asserted that the trip was made in Pullman cars, and this is followed by the text of the letter sent to President McKinley by the local McKinley Club In recommendation of a man for Isl and judge, one paragraph reading as fol lows: "Resolved, That the failure to select Mr. Little for the place would be regarded by the people of this island as an unjusti fiable act of unfriendliness." The paper has a better advertising patronage than any country paper In Kansas or Missouri, and large spaces are taken by Chinamen and Japanese. One shoe dealer uses half a column to announce that he has just re ceived a large assortment of "dancing pumps and one-strap sandals." and an other takes two columns In which to say that he has received two carloads of beer and a lot of the latest make tpyewrlters. While typewriters and beer are a some what curious combination, they are no more so than tho eggs and sewing ma chines which are sold by another dealer. That a tropical c.mate must have a sooth ing effect upon the belligerency of animals as well as man would seem to be Indicated by the advertisement of a man who offers for sale a mule "that Is guaranteed to have no vicious qualities whatever." All in all, this Hilo Tribune is an interesting publication and we are glad to have it among our exchanges. Governor Stanley has completed his affi davit of campaign expenses. He spent a total of JC13. divided as follows: State cen tral committee. $.100: railroad fare, bus and hotel bills, $230; extra copies Kansas news papers, $C0; telegrams, $30; postage, $25. " The Galena Republican has found a preacher who always charges $2 for per forming a marriage ceremony and then gives ?1 to the bride with the advice to buy a Bible. Grover Cleveland was found guilty of drunkenness in the Atchison police court tho other day. This is always the way with old topers. When arrested they never fail to give the name of some eminent citizen who was never known to taste, touch nor handle. Ex-Governor Lewelling Is the only Popu list in Kansas who has truly summed up tho political situation. In an Interview in the Wichita Eagle, he says: "Of course, there Is no way to prove it, but even If there had been no war we could not have re-elected Governor Leedy or any other Populist candidate. It was fate." Victor Murdock throws some light on the reason why legislative bills are read three times bcfore'thelr passage. He says that In the days of the first English parliament it was the custom to read the bills when the parliament was sober, when it was drunk, and after it had come to Its senses again. The death of Hon. Ed M. Hewlns Is an nounced from Douglas, Wyo., where this well known Kansas man had resided for several years. The career of Senator Hewlns serves admirably to illustrate what a state of ups and downs Kansas has al ways been. He showed how quickly for tunes may be gained and how qulekly fortunes may be lost, for he rose rapidly from a condition of poverty to one of great wealth and affluence and then In a single year went back to poverty again. His first home was In Shawnee county, where he operated a small farm. In 1S71 he went to Chautauqua county, where he es tablished himself In a humble way in the stodk business, and so prosperous did thU business become that in a few years ho owned a number of magnificent farms and thousands of cattle upon a hundred hills. At his home place near Cedarvale he had 1,600 acres, a part of which" iie devoted to a beautiful park. In which he kept a herd of buffalo and a large number of deer and antelope, besides cages of bears and other aiumah;. In 1S7G he was elected to the legislature and in 1SS1 he was promoted to the state senate, being chosen as a Demo crat, though his district was largely Re publican. He was the only Democrat In this body and his fellow senators honored him by making him the president pro tern. Commencing with 1SS5 misfortunes came to him swiftly. The hard winter of that year and the order of President Cleveland driving cattlemen out of the territory swept his fortune from him almost at one blast. He lost thousands of his cattle In the fearful blizzards, his lands depreciated In value, and Investments of various sorts went wrong, so that In a single twelve months he found himself transposed from the position of a financial giant to that of a poverty stricken pigmy. Senator Hewins once Informed Topics that his losses in the Indian Territory in the winter oflSSr.-C foot ed up $230,000. and it was commonly esti mated that before disaster came he was worth half a million. After falling from his high financial estate Senator Hewins removed to Oklahoma and later became an inspector of lands for the government. His duties took him to Wyoming, and there he died. Recently the government sent two com panies of soldiers to garris-on the Island of Hilo. where Miss Anna Rose, Topcka's Hawaiian queen, makes her home. In yes terday's mail we received a copy of the Hilo Tribune, which gives the following account of a fiagraising which took pi-toe at the military camp: "Mr. Pratt had arranged the matter al most extemporaneously, which made the whole occasion perhaps more enjoyable than If it had been a formal and long prearranged ceremony. The commanding officers of this portion of the First New York volunteers kindly assented to give a military air to the fiagraising by the presence of the troops and regimental band, while Queen Anna graciously con sented to hoist the American emblem. The troops marched up Walanuenue street about 2:30, seized the ravine which bounds that side of Reed's island without oppo sition, and scaled the opposite cliffs, pre ceded by the queen, who proved her phys ical powers again. The flag was hoisted to the music of the 'Star Spangled Ban ner,' and an address was delivered by Mr. Pratt, who thanked Miss Rose and tho officers and men of the regiment for their kind attendance. A large crowd of townspeople viewed the ceremonies from the Island and from the opposite banks. The day was, one of the most perfect which even Hilo affords, and the occa sion was one of great Interest to the Hilo ltes. It Is more than possible that Reed's island, or Riverside park as It is now known, will be the future garrison site of all the American troops on the Isl ands." At Iola on Monday Judge Stillwell, of the district court, sentenced ten jolntkccpers to terms of Imprisonment ranging from four months to two years, and to fines which aggregated $5,600. In passing sen tence upon these men Judge Stillwell said in part: "Tho spectacle we have witnessed this afternoon in the matter of the final dispo sition of these cases has been to me inex pressibly painful and saddening. Of the entire array of thpse numerous defendants who have stood up in this room to be sent enced as criminals, all except two are young men in the very prime, of life. They are magnificent specimens of physical manhood, strapping, stalwart, handsome young men. There is 'hot one" dt' them, so far as I can judge from appearance, that Is not abund antly able to earn a fair and decent living In some lawful and respectable occupation. But they have seen fit to do otherwise, and have chosen and embarked in a voca tion which Involved the continuous and frequent violation of the laws of the land. They have not only transgressed the stat utes enacted by the legislature, but they have, In effect, trampled upon and defied the constitution of tho state, the perma nent law enacted by the people In their sovereign capacity. And what excuse can they offer for their course of conduct? It cannot bo the plea of pressing want or bit ter necessity, because, as I have remarked, their personal appearance shows that they have the physical ability to earn an ample living in an honest way. This wrongful course has been dignified by no higher or better motive than mere selfish greed and to make money off of their fellow men by means of a traffic which the law denounces as criminal." 

MISSOURI POINTS. As the Hopkins Journal views It. Col onel E. W. Stephens' sirname Is likely to be his heaviest handicap In his chase for a Missouri governorship. Nodaway county's girl missionary In In dia, Miss Nettie Hyde, has been. quite ill for some time, and incapacitated for duty. At last accounts she was resting in the mountains, with the purpose of starting for home in case the hoped-for benefit is not soon realized. People familiar with the situation In the Fourth district and acquainted with Its representative are trying to figure out whether or not the Atchison Globe meant It as a joke when It slated Mont Cochran as one of the prominent figures of the next congress, and ranked him as the equal of Bryan as a talker. Her sex doesn't hold back the plucky editor of the Bolckow Herald from allud ing to some chap, with whom she differs, as "a liar," and daring him to "take it up" In the following defi: "The editor is small, but she comes of fighting stock, and if that person is looking for a scrap he knows where the office Is." i One Missouri Democrat, a member of the Fourteenth United States Infantry band, has experienced a change of heart on the silver question as a result of his summer's tarry in Manila. To a long let ter written September 30, to Ills father in Saline county. Musician M. E. Dearing adds this significant postscript: "Pa, since I came to this country and have seen what silver is worth, It has changed my politics. I don't want money that isn't worth any thing. For one five-dollar gold piece you can get all the silver you can carry, and then the silver won't buy as much as the $5 in gold will. Bryan is all right, but silver Is not; so you see the trip has done me that much good." "We saw, while reading your paper lately," writes an old subscriber, a Boone county pioneer, to the Columbia Herald, "In the 'Old County News' department, that fifty years ago two soldiers (nam ing them) had come home from the war with Mexico In which our army under Generals Scott and Taylor and their brave soldiers won so much glory and so much territory. Now I take It that this Item called to the minds of General Guitar, Dr. K. G. Sitton. of Ashland, and quite a num ber of other brave Boone county old men now, but boys then, the hardships and the pleasures of that campaign, the brave charges and never a fall back or re treat, but the forward at double quick to keep In sight of the running 'Greasers.1 These glorious remembrances certainly caused tho hearts of the old Mexican sol diers, wherever they may be, to glow and burn and made them once more sitting comfortably at their homes before their bright, cheerful fires, tell again their war stories to Interested old persons and to wide-eyed children who wonder can such things be, and will we. In our generation, ever go to war. When quite a small boy I remember attending an old-fashioned, free-to-all barbecue held at Grindstone school house one hot Fourth of July day. and hearing Judge Robert Todd, son of the late Judge David Todd, of Colum bia, make a rousing war speech, closing with a call for volunteers to go to the Mexican war, and with what awe ami anxiety I saw about twenty young men as T thought take their lives in hand and volunteer to go far from home to a for eign country to engage In war. Mexico was then several months' travel from Mis souri, and the West, In our geographies, was described as unexplored and occupied by hostile Indians." In connection with some well-merited eulogistic remarks touching the career of the late Colonel -"Dick" Musser. tho par ticulars of whose recent death at St. Joseph have previously been told, the Rich mond Missourian gives this Interesting reminiscence: "Early in ISO. Colonel Mus ser came to Richmond to see Mrs. Aaron H. Conrow, whose husband had been killed In Mexico In lSSS. Conrow had been congressman from Northwest Missouri in the Confederate congress, and escaped from Richmond, Va., on the capture of Jefferson DaIs. So Conrow (the father of David, William and Ben Conrow, and Mrs. James L. Farris. Jr., all of Richmond), in company with General Monroe Parsons, Colonel Standish and "Dutch Bill." had. at the close of the war, gone to old Mex ico for safety. Being ordered away from Monterey they were rushing rapidly to ward Matamoras to overtake Generals Prie, Marmaduke, Shelby and their friends. Camping at night, Conrow and his three companions were murdered and thrown into a stream t by Mexican sol diers. The murdered men had camped so close that Price and Marmaduke heard the firing, nnd next morning found twenty dead Mexicans piled round the camp where Mr. Conrow and his three friends had camped. The bodies of Conrow and friends were never found. Colonel Musser was en gaged by Mrs. Conrow, Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Standish to seek damages from the Mexican government. Musser alone went to the Mexican capital and fought for the relief of thei three widows. He secured the award of $50,000 to Mrs. Conrow, $50, 000 to Mrs. Parsons and $40,000 to Mrs. Standish. It was a great kindness con ferred on those good women, who In return gave Colonel Musser one-half, amounting in all to $70,000 fees." In the Face of Death. From the Springfield (Mass.) Republican. The Imagination is haunted by the dis aster of the Portland. Tho emotions of the hundreds of souls who hour after hour watched the approach of death suggests the extreme of human suffering. Yet it the realities of that experience were opened to us, we should see other things besides horror. We should see some men standing to their posts of duty in the spirit of that Greek sailor, who cried. "O, Neptune, you may sink me if you will, you may save me if you will, but whatever happens I will hold the rudder true.'r We may be sure there were women who bent themselves tu sustain the weaker ones about them. And what thoughts rose In valiant hearts, man may guess, but only God knows. Many years since, a Pacific steamer la bored for days in a gale that threatened her destruction. The captain afterward said that at one time he lost hope alto gether. Among the passengers was a man whose thought during the long suspense may have glanced back over an eventful life. He could remember a boyhood of stern toil, a manhood devoted to unselfish service, with soldiership in many a good cause. He had known love In its heights nnd sorrow in its depths. When from the past he looked out and forward to a futuro which showed the appalling aspect of tho tempest what thought rose in hira then? He lived to tell that thought. He spoke It in verse, and on that word of a strong heart many a weaker heart has rested In face of the storms and shipwrecks of this mortal life: The ship may sink. And I may drink A hasty death In a bitter sea: But all that I leave In the ocean grate Can be slipped and spared, and no loss to me. What care I Though falls the sky. And the shriveling earth to a cinder turn? No fires of doom Can eer consume What never was made nor meant to bura. Let go the breath! There Is no death To the living soul. nor. less, nor harm. Not of the clcd Is the life ol God: Let It mount, as It will, from form to form. The Hlxliop mill the Horse Clienlmit. From the New York Tribune. The student in history who in his class examination described the story of Bu cephalus as a horse-chestnut, found no dis sent among his fellow pupils, who, like himself, had been obliged to overwork the animal and found it tedious. Talcs of the real horse-chestnut and its remedial agen cy In rheumatism are not quite so tire some, though they long since lost all their novelty by repetition. It was never a matter of surprise that a rheumatic agri culturist living anywhere and vouched for by his county newspaper had carried one In his pocket ard got well; and other tes timonials of like sort from all sorts of ob scure people, while they excited little won der, did not in the least avail to change the methods of medical practice. But when a bishop has been thus cured the case as sumes a different aspect. One of them who attended the late convention at Wash ington bears unhesitating testimony to the virtues of the nut, and says that since hist discovery of its efficacy he has never ceased to carry one and sometimes two in his pocket. The first he used were picked up by him in the White House grounds while walking with Grover Cleveland, then pres ident, who gave the afflicted bishop tho straight tip In regard to their healing qual ities. Episcopal authority may not be rec ognized in therapeutics, at least by hide bound professors thereof, but it carries a certain popular weight, and as a result of the Washington bishop's experience there is perhaps more likelihood of a boom in horse-chestnuts than of a real and per manent diminution In the ranks of the rheumatic. BoTverHock, of Kniian. From the Clevelani Leader. The recent reference by the Leader to the fact thut while. "So'ckless" Simpson had been defeated for re-election to con gress from "Kansas, the voters of the Law rence district In that state had chosen a man m.mcd Howersock to represent them, still making locks considerable of an is sue, has brought .-response from one of the o.d friends of Mr. Bowersock. From that communication we learn that the successful candidate in the Lawrence district", who is a Republican, was born In Ohio; 'hat ne is a native of Hancock ,aunti3 that ho lived at Grand Rapids. Wood lounty, until about IS" years of age- when he removed to Iowa. From there he went to Kansas, settling at Lawrence, and growing up with that town. He 's now the proprietor of a big flouring mill and the president of a national bank. The Leader Is glad to know that Mr. Howersock is an Ohio man, and that he does not belong to the Simpson school' of politics. Of course. It goes without saying that an Ohio man must be all right, po litically and every other way, and one reason why the great agricultural states of the West have had such a wonderful de velopment Is that they were settled largely by people from the Buckeye state. Some of the transplanted Ohioans failed to re main true to the political principles which Inspired their fathers, but most of them are loyal Republicans, and if any of them have wandered into by-paths they are ready, we trust, to get back again into the broad political highway that leads to national prosperity and honor. The Leader salutes Congressman-elect Rowersoek, and wishes him success In "Washington. Ilinr MIsnImhIpiiI Free Sllverltci Got CuuKht. From the Chicago Titnes-llcraitt According to the New Orleans Tlcayune the free sllverites of Mississippi are stew ing in their own pickle, so to speak. A charter for an electric light and trolley company tu the city of Jackson was pre sented to Governor McLaurin. With the all-porvading know-lt-allativcness. learned In the school of Coin Harvey, the governor promptly added a clause to the instrument which provided that "nothing herein con tained shall authorize tho making or tak ing by the corporation of bonds, debts and obligations payable in gold only, but all bonds, debts and obligations shall be pay able in legal tender of the United States." Then Governor McLaurin leaned back in lils big armchair and patted his Intellect on the belt. line in self-appreciation ot hav ing dealt the gold standard a knockout blow. Soon the trouble began to brew. Trouble the silver men couldn't subdue. So they cursed McLaurin and Ilia rider too Till the air was blue. All the promoters of tho chartered com pany were silverltes. but with one accord they wanted to Issue gold bonds. In fact, without gold bomls their enterprise had no more floating quality than so much pig Iron in space. They went to Governor Mc Laurin with silver tears streaming from their eyes and lesought him to strike out the clause against gold only. But he was obdurate. His heart was silver. Now the silver men of Jackson are talk ing of an indignation meeting to denounce Governor McLaurin as a stupid old dun derpato who cannot see that silver is politics and gold is business. They do not see that the governor is consistent and that they are righteously hoisted with their own petard. Western Citlcn Fopular In Mexico. Fromthe Mexican Herald. It Is complained in New York that West ern cities are getting the larger share of the profitable trade with this country. Probably one reason for this is that cities like St. Louis and Kansas City make dill gent, and systematic efforts to obtain busi ness here, and are favored by the ex cellent railway communication direct to in terior Mexican cities. In St. Louis the Latin-American Club, composed .of fore most merchants and business men, enter tains Mexican buyers going North, and cultivates social as well as commercial re lations with the business men of this coun try. Likewise Kansas .City, a most enter prising place, has gone to work In an in telligent manner to obtain trade here. Those two .cities have, in effect, made themselves well liked and well known all over this republic. Before the time ot the railways it was natural that New York and the port cities of the Atlantic and Gulf coast should have the bulk of tho trade with Mexico. But the "iron rivers' have changed, to a large extent, the dlT rection which the international commerce of the two countries has taken, and so we now see Kansas City and St. Louis In active competition with New York, Phila delphia and Baltimore In the markets of Mexico. There is not the slightest feai that the ports of Mexico will diminish In commercial importance;' so steadily does the trade inward and outward ot Mexico augment that there is plenty of it for the sea and land routes. Where we gain here Is by the competition of the railways and the steamships. The Onlj- Sate Way. From the Chicago Post. A foolish but vainglorious fellow has put himself to the trouble ot sending us a communication complaining of the women who "bump into ine at the dry goods stores," and asking us why it is that wom en never observe tho rule "keep to the right." Really, it seems a waste of time to discuss the subject with this poor fool, who has not learned that a man forfeits his natural rights when he enters a dry goods store, whero women have the exclu sive right-of-way. whether it is right or left. Charles Hoyt illustrated the despair of men, when, after several fruitless ef forts to glide past a woman, he took off his hat and asked politely, "Madame, is it a waltz or a schottlsche?" Of course, there are times when men are compelled to enter a dry goods store, and at such unusual and eventful times we have always found It safe and expedient to drift along sideways, like Mr. Winkle's horse on that memorable Pickwickian excursion. The woman, catch ing your profile, naturally thinks you are walking straight ahead and begins a rapid calculation as to the precise spot ot violent contact, and while she is heading for this place of collision you gracefully drift by Her Into the open sea. This may be discon certing to a rushing woman, but It saves much time nnd some embarrassment for the man. We offer the suggestion to our foolish friend: Don't push; just drift. Uhc for the "Whipping Pont. From the Chicago Record. The whipping post may be considered a barbarous method ot punishment, designed to meet the needs of a ruder stage of civil ization than the present Is supposed to be. But forms of punishment held to bo bar barous may sometimes be necessary for especially barbarous offenses. The sug gestion of Mr. John G. Shortall, president of the Illinois Humane Society, that the whipping post be revived for such offend ers as wife beaters is a good one. As Mr. Shortall says. Imprisonment or fine is not a proper punishment for the wife beater, because the hardship of such punishment is likely to fall with more se verity upon the wife than upon the hus band. Frequently the wife herself will ask for remission of such punishment, particu larly if it be a fine Instead of imprison ment. AVIfo beating Is especially barbarous nnd inhuman, and the man guilty of tho offense might well be subjected to some especially degrading and effective method of punishment, such as the whipping post affords.

WEST WIND AND EAST WIND. The West Wind is the baby's wind. The country wind that's warm and Had. That bids the babies troop together To taste the West Wind weather. The West Wind Wait from hills and sets. And rus?et woodland coppices. Where violets purple In the bracken Call the slow Spring to waken. The East Wind he puts out the sun. And hides the sliver Mars in dun. And wrap the world In foulest fleeces Of fog and ragged dresses. Thou. Lord, who boldest in Thy hand. The four great winds at Thy command. Now bid the East Wind wander mourning. In deserts vast and burning. Put bid Thy West Wind Mow again. Thou, Lord, that rulest earth and main. And all the little floer-seet faces Shine in the sunny places. O Lord. Thoa Lord of night and day. Now give the children heart to play. And bid Thy sweetheart Sun be rls"n To let them out cf prison.

In the Chicago News. OF CURRENT INTEREST. When a certain house was sold in a Maine village last summer an old man was sold with It. He was a sort of human mort gage. Ten or twelve years ago tho owners of the property took In a helpless, friend less neighbor, a distant relative, who had been permanently crippled by accident. He had no means nor family, so they gener ously gave him a home. A few years later they moved out West. They could not take the old man with them, so they made an agreement with the people who purchased the farm under which for a slight reduc tion in the price the granteea agreed to as sume the responsibility of caring for the old man for life, and entered into a formal contract to furnish him bed, board, clothing, medical attendance and what ever else he should need, as If- he were a member ot their own fam ily. The new tenants carried out their agreement with conscientious fidelity, but last summer they decided to leave the place, and sold out to another family, to whom the contract for the care and custo dy of the cripple was assigned. Mayor Mooros. of Omaha. ha3 sent Presi dent McKinley a pair ot the gilded keys of the city which he presented to the dis tinguished visitors of last summer. Those for the president are larger than the others. On one Is printed, "Omaha Welcomes the President," and on the other. "October 12. 1S58." "I didn't think Mr. McKinley would have cared for the keys." ssays Mayor Moores. "and therefore did not present, him with a pair' when he was here. When he visited my office, however, he caught sight of a' couple of pairs that I proposed to give to conventions, and expressed himself! greatly pleased with them as the" means of expressing our hospitality to our visit ors. I considered, therefore, that it would be a nice little compliment for the city to present the president with a pair." Cigara and cigarettes are phenomenally chlap ip Porto Rico. Cigarettes In packs of fifteen sell for about 3 cents. The or dinary .cigar can be bought three for a cent, better ones at a cent apiece, and a S-cent cigar Is a luxury smoked only by merchants, bankers and tourists; the more expensive brands are to be had only In large towns. It Is said, however, that there Is much to be learned by the cigarmakers before their cigars can be exported profit ably, as they are not properly cured for Northern markets, and, although the to bacco used In even the modest grades Is ot a very fine quality, the cigars are roughly made, and hence draw Imperfect ly and smoke unevenly. The Delta Light House, of Greenville. Miss., edited by a colored man. prints this somewhat delphlc utterance: "The race trouble In South and North Carolina were just horrid. Some one, no doubt, would like to know our views on that matter. Wa can state In short by saying that without the shedding of blood there Is no remission of sins. Our answer to the above sentence may not be appreciable In this one; but wa believe that all races must shed some blood before they can possess true love for the country In which they have Immigrated. It. Is true that the colored man has been In this country a good long time, but he nas a good long ways to go yet." The capital of Liberia. Monrovia, named from President James Monroe, under whose administration It was founded. Is hardly to be told to-day from a prosperous town In the Southern states, except for tho greater number of negroes; and, significant ly enough, of churches. It has about 13. 00 inhabitants and Is fortunate In beins the only town of any size In the country, the population generally being scattered over a large area in hamlets or little vil lages. Congressman Mercer, of Pensylvania. ha3 received from a lady who has evidently been Impressed by the reputation he has acquired for being able to accomplish things, a letter In which the writer says: "I hear you are able to do anything you set out to do. I have three houses and a vacant lot that I want very much to dis pose of. Now, won't you please sell them for me?" Tho doorkeeper of the Boston theater, who died recently, held his place thirty three years, and in all that time never witnessed a play there or anywhere else. On only one occasion he asked for a holi day, and that was to attend a clambake down the harbor. Ho missed the boat, und was In his place at the theater door at the regular hour. A Boston woman, selecting a hat at a milliner's, asked, cautiously. "Is there any thing about these feathers that might bring me into trouble with the Audubon Society?" "Oli, no. madam." said the milliner, who was from 1-ondon; "these feathers. maiLini. are the feathers of a howl; and the howl, you know. Is more of a cat than a bird." A Florida Inventor has designed a s teim boat to run on the lee In winter, runners being mounted on tho under aide at the proper depth to bring the end of the padr die blades to the level of the Ice. each blade being tipped with a steel point, which sticks Into the Ice and propels the boat.
