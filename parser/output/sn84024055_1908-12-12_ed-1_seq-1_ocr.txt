President Roosevelt rails against the trusts and the monopolies, notwith standing the fact, that those who own and control them, have for many years furnished the money to enable the President and his party to main tain a firm grip, around the throats of the American people.

I to have prepared his last and long farewell message to Congress. what followed it I Come at once to the present condition of things, stated from a" constitutional and political standpoint Anfl that Is this: That In all southern states it Is possible, by election laws prescribing proper qual ifications for the suffffrage, which square with the fifteenth amendment and which shall be equally admin istered as between the black and white races, to prevent entirely the possibility of a domination of southern stats, county, or municipal govern ments by an Ignorant electorate, white or black. lt is further true that the sooner such laws, when adopted, re applied with exact equality and justice to- the two races, the better for the moral tone of the state and commun ity concerned. "Negroes should' be given an oppor tunity, equally with, whites, by edu cation and thrift, to meet the re quirements of eligibility which the state legislatures in their wisdom shall lay down in order to secure the safe exercise of the electoral fran chise. The Negro should ask nothing other than an equal chace to qualify himself for the franchise, and when that is granted by law and not denied by ezecative dtecrlmfoerSoB, he has nothing to compJsin of.

The new Ward McAllister of Chicago, who will shortly be given the right hand of fellowship and become a full fledged member of the Fellow ship Club. -' Mr. J. W. Anderson, 79 East 32nd, street will leave for New York City Friday, Dec 18th, to spend the holi- 'day's with his parents, who now re side in that city. Returning about January 10th, at which time it is ru mored that he will become a candi date for membership of the Fellow ship Club, fronr which he lias been the recipient of much hospitality. Mr. Anderson was born in Kings ton, Jamaica (British West Indies), In 1869.. After receiving his prelim inary education In" the public schools of that city he availed himself with the opportunity of an apprenticeship In a cigar-making establishment, and after completing the trade started out In the world on his own resources Coming to New York City in 1884, where he worked at this trade for four years, and being subjected to various disadvantages, necessitated giving It up. Coming to Chicago In 1889, he became a student in the old Central Institute now on East Ran dolph street where he qualified him self for the postal service, taking a special review course In high school the race question In the south and its political bearing that takes away any justification for maintaining the con tinued solidity of the south to prevent the so-called Negro domination. The fear that in some way or other a so cial equality between the Taces shall be enforced by law or brought about by political measures really has no foundation except in the imagination of those who fear such a result The federal government has nothing to do with social equality. Social equality is something that grows out of vol untary concessions hj the Individuals forming society. Mr. Taft referred to the trials of the reconstruction period as further agencies that helped to keep alive the feeling engendered by that con troversy, and continued: "But times change, and men change with them. The growth -of the south since 1890 has been marvelous. The manufacturing capital in 1880 was $250,000,00; In 1890. $650,000,000 inr 1900, $U50.000,000, and in 1908, $2. 100,000,000, while. the value of the manufacturers increased from $450, 000,000, ia 1880 to 12,60,000.000 In 1908. Ther south has become rich, and only the surface of its wealth has been scratched. Its growth has exceeded that of the rest of the country and it Ih now in every way sharing in its prosperity. Many Seathrons Seek Change. , "Again the Democratic party has not preserved inviolate its traditional doctriee as to state rights and ether tosses, as has Tor the time adopted new doctrines of poesftly seehtfal ecoeoiBJo tratk wisdom.

Maintaining this temporary position for six months, and as It seems without any prospect of an iajQyv permanent appointmentjind with this fact In view, together with decreasing revenue, availed himself with the opportunity of a position out of the government service in a more subordinate capacity, but with great er recompense. Since living in this city Mr. Anderson has maintained the respect and good fellowship of all with whom he came in contact His name has figured in connection with many grand social functions given in this city. He is an energetic mem ber of the Appomattox Club and the Frederick Douglass Center. A member of the Ancient Order of Foresters, and a Mason. of exalted degree.

"I believe that the movement away from political' solidarity has started, and ought to be encouraged, and I think one way to encourage it is to have the south understand that the attitude of the north and the Repub lican party toward it Is not one of hostility, or criticism, or opposition, political or otherwise; that they be lieve in the maintenance of the fif teenth amendment but that as at ready explained they do not deem that amendment to be inconsistent with the south's obtaining and maintain ing what it regards as Its political safety from domination of an ignor ant electorate; that the north yearns for closer association with the south; that its citizens deprecate that reserve on the subject of politics which so long has been maintained in the other wise delightful social relations be tween southerners and northerners as they are more and more frequently thrown together.
