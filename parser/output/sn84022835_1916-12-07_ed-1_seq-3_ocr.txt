RED OLOUD, NEBRASKA, CHIEF w CUB liS WILSON'S MESSAGE President's Address to Both Houses Is Quite Short. HAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST Further Legislation on That Line Is Strongly Recommended Bill Giv ing Foreign Commerce Promo ters Free Hand NeccsGary. Washington, Dec. C President WIN on today delivered his message to tooth houses of congress In Joint bcs lon. The nddrcss wns ns follows : 3entlcmen of the Congress: In fulfilling nt this time the duty laid upon mo by the Constitution of com municating to you from time to time information of the state of the Union and recommending to your considera tion such legislative measures ns may t)0 Judged necessnry and expedient I ehnll continue tho practice, which I tiopo has been acceptable to you, of leaving to the reports of tho scvernl beads of the executive departments the elaboration of the detailed tieeds f the public service and confine myself to those mnttcrs of more general pub lic policy with which It seems neces sary and feasible to deal nt the pres et session of the congress. I realize tho limitations of time lin ger wlilch you will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug entlons as few ns possible ; but there 'were some things left undone nt the last session which there will nqw be time to complete and which It seems necessary In the Interest of the public to'do nt once. In the first place, It seems to me Im peratively necessnry thnt the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the remaining treasures of the program of settle ment and regulation which I had occa sion to recommend to you nt the close of. your last session In view of the pub lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom modated difficulties which then existed, -an fe y 0 and which still unhappily continue to xlst, between the railroads of the untry and their locomotive engineers, conductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended: First, Immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the Interstate commerce commission along the lines embodied In the bill recently pnssed by the house ot representatives nnd now awaiting action by the senate ; In order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many great and various duties now devolving upon It with n prompt ness and thoroughness which are, with Its present constitution nnd means of action, prnctlcally impossible. x Second, the establishment of nn Ight-hniir dny as the legal basis alike of work and of wages In tho cmploy i ment of all railway employees who are Actually engaged In the work of oper ating trains In Interstate transporta tion. Third, the authorization of tho ap pointment by tho president of a smnll tody of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour dny In railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the In terstate commerce commission of nn .'' Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail . ronds ns may have been rendered nec essary "by the adoption of tho eight hour day and which have not been off set by administrative readjustments end economies, should the facts dis closed Justify the Increase. Fifth, nn amendment of the existing federal stntute which provides for tho , mediation, conciliation, and arbitration " of such controversies ns the present by ndding to it a provision that, in case tho methods of accommodation now provided for should fall, n full public Investigation of the merits of, every such dispute shjUl be Instituted nnd completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully bo attempted. And, sixth, the lodgment in tho hands of the executive of the power, In enso of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try ns may bo required for military use nnd to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into tho military service of tho United States such train crows nnd adminis trative officials as tho circumstances require for their safe and efllclcnt use. Renews His Recommendations. Tho second nndthlrd of theso rcc ' smmendntlons the congress Immediate ly acted on: It established the eight ' hour day as tho legal basis of work and wuges in train service and It au thorized the appointment of a com mission to observe and report upon tho practical results, deeming theso the measures most immediately needed; but It postponed action upon tho other suggestions until an opportunity should bo offered for a raoro deliberate con sideration of them. Tho fourth rec ommendation I 'do not deem It neces sary to renew. Tho power 8f tho in terstate' commerce commission to grant a Increase of rates on the ground re- rred to Is Indisputably clear and a nkJf 1 rr At (commendation by tho congress with gard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of tho com- Bolwlon' authority or its inclination to do Justice when there is no reason to doubt either. Tho other suggestions the Increase In tho Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and In Its facilities for performing Its mnnlfold duties, tho provision for full public Investigation nnd assessment of Industrial disputes, nnd the grant to the executive of tho power to control nnd operute tho rail ways when necessary In tlmo of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Thoso who have Intrusted us with tho responsibility nnd duty of serving nnd safeguarding them In such matters would find It bard, I believe, to excuse n failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does tho Interstate com merce commission now find It prnctl cally Impossible, with Its present mem bership and organization, to perform Its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but It Is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy nnd exacting. It must llrst be perfected ns un administrative Instru ment. The country cannot nnd should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound Industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion nnd conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of tho execu tive to make Immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they nre needed. This Is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative elllcleticy which argii.es Its own case In the mere statement of It. With regard to one of Its Items, the Increase In the effi ciency of the Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted; Its action needs only the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any tuiln In any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in nn employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the Individual workman to lenve his work before re ceiving the approval of society In do ing p would bo to adopt a new prin ciple Into our Jurisprudence which I tnko It for granted we are not prepared to Introduce. Hut the proposal that the operation of tho railways of the country shall not be stopped or Inter rupted by tho concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until n public Investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at Issue plain for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation Is not to propose any such principle. It Is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the In dustrial processes of the nation, nt any rate before the nation shall have hud an opportunity to acquaint Itself with the merits of tho case as between em ployee nnd employer, tlmo to form Its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider nil practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but tho Justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessnry processes of Its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust In it unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can nnd should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the Interests and liber ties of all concerned nscwell as for the permanent Interests of society Itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital importance awult the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by tho house of representatives: tho bill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to thoso engaged In pro moting the foreign commerce of tho country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; tho bill amending the present organic Inw of Porto Rico ; and tho bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of tho expenditure of money in elections, com monly called tho Corrupt Practices Act I need not labor my advlco that these measures be enacted Into lnw. Their urgency lies In tho manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only opportune but neces sary. Even delay would seriously Jeopard tho Interests of tho country and of tho government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg ulate tho expenditure of money in elec tions may seem to bo less necessnry than tho Immediate ennctment of the other measures to which I refer; be causo ut least two years will elapse heforo another election In which fed eral offices are to bo filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind If this Important matter wero dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to tho public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand clear under re cent observation and tho methods of expenditure can be frankly studied In tho light of present experience ; nnd a delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until unothcr election was at hand and some special object connected with It might bo thought to bo in tho mind of those who urged It Action can bo taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shnll not argue at length tho desir ability of giving a freer hand in the mutter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, fins Indeed already assumed, n magni tude unprecedented in otir experience. Wo hnvo not the necessary Instrumen talities for its prosecution; it ,1a deemed to bo doubtful whether 'hey could be created upon nn adequato scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will glvo freedom without permitting unregulated license. Th thing must bo done now, becauso tha opportunity Is hero nnd may escapo us If wo hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. Tho argument for tho proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Itlco Is brief nnd conclusive. The present laws governing tho Island nnd regulating tho rights and privileges of Its people are not Just. We have cre uted expectations of extended privi lege which wo hnvo not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among tho peoplo of the Island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of tho pending measure would happily re move. Wo do not doubt what we wish to do In any essential particular. We ought to do It at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which It Is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found nnd action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In the many mensures of constructive pol icy with which ydu have enriched tho legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor In such company. 1 take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare servlcoubleness and distinction. Bound to Make Good. The well-dressed stranger stepped Into the drug store nnd, passing by the boy who usually attended to casual customers, approached the proprietor, who was arranging some goods In tho show case. "Mr. C , I presume?" he re marked, pleasantly, and the druggist turned and bowed gravely. "I hnvo heard my friend, Mr. Quorn, speak of you often," said the brisk niun. "Ho told me if ever I needed anything in this line to come to you. He spoke of you us a man on whom one could rely with perfect confidence, who bad only the best of evrythlng and with whom Ifwap always a pleasure to deal." "Mr. Quorn is very kind," unswercd tho other, beaming with gratification. "He Is one of by best customers. What can I do for you this mornlng7" Well er this morning, us It hap pens," said the strungcr, with Just a little briskness, "this morning I should like, if you will atlow me, to consult your directory." "Certainly," was tho calm reply. "Wo also have a good selection of one and two-cent stamps as well as railway tlmo tables, f you need anything of that kind." Franklin Objects Seriously. Sho Isn't very large, that's true, but being a county seat, and boasting of a college, several factories, flour mills, railways, lnterurbans nnd her lately acquired Masonic home, Franklin feela thnt she is not a town to be passed lightly by, in fact, sho knows her Im portance, nnd thought that everyone In the Btato realized It until she was taken down a bit lately. During tho big conference of the Methodist churches held recently in the town a meeting of tho Indianapolis presbytery was in session at the same time at Hopewell, a country church In a pros perous farming community a few miles out Ono of tho Presbyterian delegates, on leaving the train Joined In tho throng headed for tho Method ist church. When It came to regis tering, some of his Inquiries caused someone to suggest thnt probably he was In the wrong place, and ho asked innocently: "Isn't this Hopewell?" "No, this b Franklin," was the proud reply. Indlnnapolls News. Rather Embarrassing. Irvin Cobb, tho war correspondent homo from Europe long enough recent ly to get his breath and look over the proof sheets of a new book, attended an authors' banquet In Now York. A deaf man sat next to Cobb. Far ther down tho table another man told a funny story, and when ho finished, tho deaf man laughed and applauded louder and. longer than any of the rest. "Good old boyl" shouted the deaf man. "That reminds mo of n story,'.' ho added to those near by? "Get up and tell it, Charlie," cried several. Tho toastmuster sanctioned the suggestion. Then the deaf man got up and told tho same story tho other man had told. He Was on the Job. The undertaker arose and said to the mourners assembled: "If anyone present wishes to say a few words of tribute to the deceased, now Is tho time, when the family will be glad to hear such." A stillness prevailed, and after a fow moments of sllenco It was broken by a young man, who aroso and usked : "Do I understand that no ono wishes to make any remarks?" "It would appear bo," replied tho undertaker. Then," asked tho young man, as a light carao into his eyes, "may I be permitted to make a few remarks about southern California and its woo- dwrful climate?" HOT lift BiD

Although tho cattlo industry was congratulating itself that a dread ed epidemic was not imminent, both stock-raisers and packers were dis turbed by the announcement that the appearance of stomatitis was more widespread than any other outbreak of that ailment in tho history of this country.
