FOR THE' SCHOOLGIRL FROCK THAT COPIES FASHION OF HER ELDERS. Attractive and Economical, It Will Be Pleasing to the Mother aa Well aa a Delight to the 8mall Wearer. Even the little tots are disporting themselves In the contrasting material costumes that were so much in voguo In the eighties. Tbo fashion has one thing to recommend It, and that Is Its economy where old clothes are to be made over. Part of Jane's and of Willy's frock would make a quite new looking suit tor Willy. Or a good skirt could be made to serve duty for a tu nic of new material. Aa every mother knows, children are hard on their sleeves. The tunic In the patterns may be made with either long or short sleeves and with a*plain hem or a scalloped bottom. The pattern makes allow ances for both, and this really gives a woman two patterns for the price of one. The writer recommends the long •leeves and, If one has the time, scal loped bottom with a narrow bias fold of a contrasting color stitched the edge of the scallops. The material used here is a striped and a plain gingham, and the blouse Is stitched to the waistband and with an outside belt. For dress wear there should be a dainty white lingerie collar. Now that grown-ups wear plaited and gathered dresses the small ladies want to do the same—or their mothers want them to, which amounts to the same thing. Perhaps the. prettiest way of putting in gathers on little folks' smocking, which has been revived and over worn frocks Is the old-fashioned ■I Frock for the Schoolgirl. has, perhaps, never been more popular. Smocking is easily learned, and it makes a very pretty decoration to smock white frocks with colored cot ton, or blue or pink linens and cottou with white embroidery cotton. If a mother does not wish to take the trouble of making a skirt and tunic according to this pattern she can easily omit the tunic skirt.—Washing ton Star. Panne Velvet Stylish. It looks as If panne and mirror vel ve.t would be more stylish than the or dinary silk pile velvet for the after noon and evening dresses this season. Of course for the conservative woman ordinary velvet and velveteen will be worn for suits and gowns also. It ts just a case of shiny, surfaced velvets being more fashionable, Just as they are for millinery styles. In the woolen materials vicuna, which looks like a very fine eponge fabric, is very smart for the long outside afternoon coats; It is to bo had tn magnificent color ings—deep pansy, heliotrope, wine, old blues, deep greens and browns. After noon dresses are combinations of chif fon and mirror velvet, though here and there are very good taffeta models made wlntrlfled by bands of metal lace and of fur. Bands of velvet replace fur on some of the less pretentious models. Crepe Collar Darned in Yarn. Worsted remains a favorite trim ming. It is used on neckwear, too. and a most attractive crêpé collar shows a border of strands of worsted run along in half-inch stitches with a blunt needle. PRETTY ON THE NIGHTGOWN Hand Embroidery la to Be Recom mended, Though of Course There Are Many Substitutes. Hand embroidery Is a very satis factory means for lifting a nightgown from the commonplace. A crocheted yoke is another effective thing to use <o ornament a nightie: but there are women who haven't the time nor the ability tn do either kind of taneywork. and yet they long to make attractive nightgowns for themselves. For these, ■then, a nightgown which was included du a young girl's trousseau should be described, ao that It can be copied by women out of the taneywork class. The nightgown was of the softest, finest quality of nainsook. It was made empire. The round neck was dnlBbed with embroidery beading. Groups of smocking at either side or the front at forded fullness and were done lo blue oierecrtzed cotton. Outlining the baby waist line were embroidery medallions, placed at regu tar iytervals. These were stitched lop and bottom, but lb* sides were unat {/, EVENING CAP *2,4 - m / 'V a of a a a u * p 4 •:x 4, 4 J: f ' l. 1 f L The charming model of this evening cap it made In a mushroom shape with a narrow brim of satin and a small ruffle of mallnes over the brim.

TWO GOOD CLEANING HINTS Best Method of Removing Mildew From White Goods—For Paint 8tains on Clothing. For removing mildew from white material take one teaspoonful of chlor ide of lime and one teaspoonful of washing soda. Put this and the mil dewed article into two quarts of cold water and let it boil for about four hours; then skim off the scum, add two pailfuls of cold water and let It stand over night, with the article well cov ered. If this is not long enough, put the article back again and soak it until the .mildew entirely disappears; then rinse well and wash In the usual way. Be sure to take off the scum, for that is what burns the material in so many of the recipes given. To remove paint from clothes use equal parts of benzine and ammonia, rubbing with a cloth on the wrong way of the nap to get out all the paint. Then hang the garment on the clothes line to dry in the open air. When dry, If no trace of the paint Is seen, bru^h the cloth in the proper direction. When using benzine keep away from fire. WORK-CASE TO FIT POCKET Most Useful and Simple Little Recep tacle May Be Work of a Few idle Minutes. a A pocket work-case just to hold half a dozen needles and the contents of a reel of cotton wound upon a card Is a very useful little thing, and sketch shows a neat little article of this description. It can be made from any remnant of silk and is lined with thin silk and bound at the edges with narrow ribbon. It holds together in the center, and the two sides are stiffened with pieces of card sewn In between the silk and the lining Dpon one side a pocket is arranged in which the cotton wound upon the card may be placed, and dia gram B shows the chape In which ibe card should be cut out, and the tndical our cross a small slit cut for holding the end oi the cotton. To the center of the case a single leaf oi tlannel cut into points at the A A f Ö Q" ft mm /t l it«*«». edges is sewn for the needles, and the needles selected should not be too small. The case fastens when closed with a tab and a push button as seen In diagram A. The initials of the owner can be worked where Indicated. Shawl Draperies. Lace of many kinds is in request, and shawl draperies are among the most artistic touches for the evening dresses of today, are attached at the back and held up to the figure at the sides by bracelets of small roses made in gold r~ slipped over the arm. The low bodice of transparent stuffs is often kept in place by a chain of diamante. Sometimes these gauze tached. The material was cut away from beneath each medallion and blue ribbon was run beneath them So much ribbon appearing on the right side the nightgown was a little different from the usual method of allowing the ribbon to show at the slots only and go on its way along the wrong side of the nightie, ^ace medallions successfully substituted for those embroidery can be of The Frill in Full Swing.

A candy thermometer may be purchased for a dollar which will in sure good results as it gives the tem perature when the sirup should be tak en from the fire. The very best flavor ing should be used as well as the best and purest colorings. . Sugar for the little folks' cakes and candies may be colored at home.
