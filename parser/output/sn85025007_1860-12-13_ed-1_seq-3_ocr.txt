[rEPORTKD I'oR TUS ALEXANDRIA GAZMTK.J la Senate, Wednesday Deo. 12. The Senate was called to order at noon, and after prayer, and the reading of the jour n&Mr. Bigler, of Pennsylvania introduced an amendment to the Morrili la.'in. b!ll which on his motion, was referred to tno Committee on Finance. Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, from t-.ie Com mittee on Finance reported back the lrcasu rv Note bill, passed by the House ol Rep resentatives, with sundry amendments. The first amendment, providing that t.io lowest denomination oi' thy notes should be fifty instead of one hundred dollars, was agreed to. * The second amendment provided that tho recepts of the sales oi tho public lands should be set aside to redeem these notes, anu tliat they be limited in amount to ?3,000,000. The amendment was advocated by Mr. Hunter and Mr. Fessenden and opposed by Messrs. Simmons,Collamer, Wade and oth ers. The amendment was agreed to. Mr. Wade, of Ohio, introduced an amend ment providing that nothing in the bill should be construed to limit tho power <> Congress to dispose of the laud as i*. should deem proper. Mr. Wude thought that unless tin* amend ment was adopted, there might be a miscon ception. He called upotUbe friends oi tne Homestead policy and ol the Pacific Railroad to sustain it. Mr. Clinj;man was surprised that any Senator should object to the United Mates paying its debts with its own property, lor the reason that he wished to give the piypei ty away. He was like the man who a?. ine end of his career, declared that he had lost all, but that he had given away. Mr. Hunter thought that it might be dim cult to pass the Treasury notes with the amendment. He fielievcd, that the enect or the amendment would be injurious to tno value of the notes. Mr. Gwin opposed the amendment, an said he saw no necessity lor it. ^ Mr. Wade defended his position, and call ed for the yeas and nays. The amendment was adopted b}' yeas 28, nays 27. . . The question then reeurr.ing upon the amendment, as amended. Mr. Hunter thought that the clause had beeu rendered nugatory, and could not vote for it. Mr. Gwin called for the yeas and nays. Mr.-Trumbull said there was no necessi ty for that; no one was in iavor ol the clause. The amendment as amended, was then rejected. 'The hill was then ordered to be engrossed and having been read the third time, was passed. Mr. Crittenden, or Ivy., introduced a pri vate memorial, which, on his motion was referred to the committoe on private land claims. Several other memorials were reterreu, aud papers permitted to be withdrawn iiotn the files. . The Senate then took up the resolution oi Mr. Powell, of Kv., providing for the ap pointment of a Committee of thirteen to con sider the President's Message. Mr. Wigfall, of Texas, continued the dis cussion of the question oi his personal con sistency, as assailed by Mr. Douglas, yes terday. lie quoted the record, and argued at length to vindicate bis consistency. During his speech, he gave \vav to a m<> tion of Mr. Yulee, ol Ha., to roconsider the vote by which the Treasury note bill was passed ; which motion was entered on the journal. . . ,. Mr. Wigfall, having finished his vindica tion, proceeded to oousidcr the resolution, lie did not believe that Mr. Douglas, and a friend of his from Missouri, could refer tlr.s difficulty to two justices of the peaoe, and settle it before sundown. This was a ques tion which could be settled by the people the States, only. Whipped syllabub whs not the remedy for the patient, now. The Union could not be saved by eulogies.? The South demanded that she should be allowed peace. He would tell the Senators i>:i the other si?.e of the Chamber the condition upon which he would consent to remain in the. Union with them. They must abolish abolition societies, stop abolition newspapers, and stop the clamor now raging in their nuusr.? j Laughter on the. Republican sioe.j lou laugh in mv face. [Additional laughter.] He called upon the Union-saving Senators to look at the derision and contempt which mot his proposition. He besought them to look?"Jew est el ab hos.'e uoceri. ? mild they still contiuue to by for the privilege of paying taxes to sustain the manufactures, build the roads, and clean out the harbors of this*people, who would hold the I'lnon to aether with hemp. The people ol the rsortn would soon know the spirit of the South, and it might be "where the battle wrec?r was thickest," learn that "Cotton was King.'' [Applause in the galleries.] The President, pro tan, Mr. Foot, said that if the disorder was repeated, he would order the galleries to be cleared. Mr. Hate thought that if ever there Wns a time in which the galleries should be cleared, it was now. Mr Wigfall said that if the mdecent in dignity was repeated, he would move n< t only that the galleries be cleared, but tunt the doors be locked, and the Senate be allow ed to deliberate in peace. Mr. W., continuing h^s argument, sa:d he knew the game of the Northern represen tatives. They knew that when the calami ty incident upon disunion cacne ; when the factories stopped, the ships rotted, and the operatives aud sailors saw starvation staring them in the face, their heads would not be safe upon their shoulders, but they hoped 'ere the treasury was drained of its last dol lar and while confusion reigned supreme to make soldiers of these starving operatives. The confederacy of our fathers had gradually been changed. The bounds ot Massachu setts had been extended until the whole peo ple were included within them-and the en fire Union governed by the Massachusetts school of which the Senator from fcew lork (Mr. Seward) bad protested himself a red lower Tbis consolidation he would ever onpose, but when be was called upon, as be would be before many days, to vote upon the government for a new confederation, he would advocate the conscuuti^i oui la thers had adopted tor all the States. Un der this confederated government when the border States came in. he cxpocted to as sist to adjust the /<???/? relations with the Northern States, lie (set;liir*d th';! Mr. Douglas in his NorfoU >pe^ h h. t promised to hang Mr. Lincoln, u he did not administer the government accoruing to his (Mr D.) views, and to gibbet the 'P Virginia if, in the exe.cise of their rights they dared to rebel against Mr. Urocojn. _ Mr. D.. always seemed to thin* everybody entitled to manage tlu-ir own affairs, except the neople of a sovereign state. He trusted, he continued, that the South would soon be able to dictate a trewty in Fan en! Hall, the cradle of liberty, but the o-rave of the constitution.

John Brown Wide-awake f'retoriaus that the Senator from Xew York had bidden to main taiu their organization after the election, to insure the fruits of their victory. Mr. Seward said he would like to know the grounds ou which the Senator made the statement. Mr. Wigfall ?aid lie had spen the speech published in the newspapers. Mr. Seward said the first mention of the subject ho ever heard, was in a letter he re ceived from the South. lie could not imag ine out of what the misstatement had grown. He was confident that he bad never recom mended to the Wide Awakes to continue their organization after the election. Mr. Wigfall said that the Senator's de nial was ail ho could ask. The fact that the Wide Awakes still continued their or ganization in menace to the South was un doubted. He adverted to the decreasing numbers of the conservative Senators and iu naming them, omitted Mr. Dougias. A voiee.?Mr. Douglas. Mr. Wigfali.?Non tvli avxilio nec dtjen soribus isdd, ki/ipus egci.

Mr. Wigfali, at 4 o'clock, gave way to a motion that the Senate go into Executive session, which was agreed to. The Senate, after some time spent in se cret session, adjourned. Houso of Representatives. j After prayer and the reading of the JY.ur nal, | The Speaker, pursuant to the order uf | yesterday, called the States for the subrais j sion of propositions relative to the present | cundition of tbecountry. Nearly two dozen different propositions i i were'presented, and referred to Special Union I ! Committee. Many of them proposed amend- ? | men Li to the Constitution on the slavery j j question, and ali looked to conciliation. Mr. Thayer, of Mass., preseated a series of resolutions proposing certain concessions j for the peace of the country. Mr. Adrian, of X. J., offered a series of j ! resolutions to the eil'eet that the doctrine of ! j non-intervention by Congress, either to pro hibit or protect the domestic institution of ! slavery in the Territories of this Government i should be adopted on the ba.?.is of compro i miso between the North and South; thereby j leaving tlie whole question of slavery in tho I Territories to be determined by the people, I and laws of climate. And further, that any | territory should be admitted into the Union ?' with such ;i constitution a^ a majority of the people might adopt, provided it be republi can in form*, without any regard whether said constitution permitted or prohibited the do- j mestie institution of slavery. And airain, j that all statutes enacted by any State Legis lature, in conflict with or in violation of the Constitution of the United States and the lows of Congress made in pursuance thereof, j should be repealed. And lastly; that the fu gitive-slave law is constitutional, and the i law of the land; and, as such, should be re I sptctcd and observe.'!. The plan uf Mr. Smith of Va , provided ibat ( the committee of thirly-three shall take into consideration (lie policy of excluding from the Federal Union each member thereof, which by her legislation shall nullify un act of Congress. Mr. Leake, of Va.. proposed a c institu tional provision, either that Congress should have 110 power over slavery either in the j State* or Territories, or that it should give j protection to slavery: that Territorial Leg- j islatures should protect slavery, and that no I slave should be freed by passing in transitu j thrcugh any of the Slates of the Confedc-! racy. Mr. .Jenkins, r.f Va.. proposed an amend* ! ment to the Constitution, and the more ol!i- j cient execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. j Mr. Noel, of Mo., submitted a proposition ] for an amendment of the Constitution, abol- ! ishing the otliee of President, and creating i in lien thereof an Executive Council of three, I with power to veto any measure againpt sla very. Mr. Mai lory's resolution provided for the establishment of the line of 30? iiOrT the North to be free and the South, slave. After a very large number of resolutions | of similar character and purport had been! presented, the call upon States was finished. ! Mr. Stallworth, of A la., asked to 'no excused j from serving as a member of the committee j on Military Affairs, say ing t hat he did not ex- \ pcct to remain long a member of the House, j On motion his request was granted. Some other business* of no general inter- j est was transacted, and at 2} o'clock, tho j House adjourned.
