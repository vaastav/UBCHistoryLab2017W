Strictly speaking, of course, the re cent sanitary investigation was not an investigation at all, but mainly an effort of the physicians to prove that Dr. Parsons was eligible to member ship in the Ananias Club. "Of course. You can not lower the tariff when times are ticklish, lest It make them worse; and you can not lower it when times are good lest it may upset things. The only states manship, it seems, is postponement of the necessary and inevitable. New York World. There is nothing in the rumor that on account of his loss of '"nerve" at the last session of the sanitary Inves tigation, Dr. Parsoas will change the title of his forthcoming lecture. Fact is that in facing a judge and jury composed mainly of the men who were accused. Dr. Parsons has shown more nerve than Is usually given to anybody except editors and politicians The "Parson" finds it necessary to explain that the "parsons Article" which figured so largely in the "sani tary investigation" was written by one Dr. C. L. Parsons. Neither the "Parson" nor Ralph M. "Parsons, teacher of the big Sunday school class, should be confused with the Parsons who stirred up the doctors and who is to appear as the next at traction in the public school lecture course. No doubt he fully appreciates the efforts of the physicians to adver tise his coming lecture.

The Clovis Mercantile Company is the name of a new firm that plans to open a large general store at Clovis between the first of January and the first of February. The men in the company are all well known citizens of Roswell, and, as it happens, all have been employees of the Joyce Pruit Company. They are Charles Sheppard, Jacob U. Gross and W. M. Bohannon. The first two are employ ed on the grocery side of the Joyce- Pruit store and the last has been in the clothing department for a number of years, but is now taking a vacation before going into the new business. Charles Sheppard is the oldest con tinuous employee of the Joyce-Pruit Company, having been with the firm eight years without interruption. All members of the lew firm are good business men and have many friends here who regret to see them leave, but" wish them, the greatest of success in their new venture. machinery at his shop a few days ago.

"President Roosevelt's message to congress, while one of the longest ever sent by a president, contained not a solitary word relative to state hood for New Mexico in any form, notwithstanding all his promises and bombastic utterances in the past.

The titles to the lands under them will thenceforth be freed frorn all clouds which the suit has cast up on them and the farmers will be able to devote their entire time and ener gies to the further improvement of their lands and to the raising of crops The parties to the suit are to ,be con gratulated upon such a fortunate out come, on their own account, and the people of this community are equally to be congratulated that this vexa tious and long drawn out litigation has been brought to so satisfactory a conclusion.

It is with satlsfection that the peo ple of Roswell will hear that the diffi culties between the Woodlawn Ditch Co. and the Southspring Ranch & Cat tle Co., involving the water rights to a large portion of the water of the Sou-tii Spring River, hare finally been adjusted by agreement and settlement to the satisfaction of the parties con cerned. The water in vol ved in the controversy irrigates about three thou sand acres of the most valuable and productive land In the rich agricultu ral district around Roswell, and the suit "which baa been in court for near ly five years lias been not only a sub- " ject of annoyance, expense and un pleasant feeling to the parties direct ly interested, but has threatened bad ly to affect land values in this neigh borhood. The laws la regard to thi appropriation and use of water are complicated and vexing even to the best trained lawyers and jurists, giv ing an opportunity In any controversy arising about water, rights for almost endless discussion.

What's the matter with Pitts burg, where being a street car con ductor pays better than being minis ter or teacher? El Paso Herald. The Herald probably does not mean this as a sneer at the value of educa tion. Even if the highly educated man be compelled by circumstances to take a job as a street car conductor. he still has an advantage over the man who doesn't know anything else but ringing up five cent fares. Tiie educated man lives in a world that is -not bounded by mere wages and grub and still may be as good a me chanic or common laborer as the one who only eats and sleeps outside of working hours.
