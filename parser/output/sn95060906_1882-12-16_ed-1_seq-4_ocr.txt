It is a description of part of the decorations of a million'- aire's houso in Now York: "At ono ol tho doors of a dining-room hu'igs a porlicro of silver cloth, decorated intjpustry stitch with festoons of fruits and llowcrs, appropriately suggestive to tiio owner 01 tno abundance, loriuni.oi Hie goou tilings ot lite.

No ono will pretend that whero two audi pictures as tho foregoing ban be dra n thero is no cause for tpprohonsion. This is a republic; Iho only protection that wealth has tho forbearanco of- tho peoplo who Iro poor. It is all well enough to say tiat m this world all men play at tho kmo of fortune; that tho winning pkots aro fow, whilo tho blanks aro lany, and that tho rich man can do btlnng better than to build palaces, tho building and furnishing of urn distributes money among tho oopror Up to a certain point that is truo; but it is strango that men who hayo more money than thoy can use do not seek to leavo to their children protection U3 well an wealth. It oosts about $30,000,000 annually lio support tho government of tho Kity of Now York. A mighty quota I of that amount goes to pay for poorly protecting society against criminals. f-ui. .'s' - -i,nt a million por huiiium could bo spared to clear out 'those dreadful tcnoment houses, to send thoir inmates to tho. cheap lands of tho west, and to make homes for henmiefo; -before a doeadc passed way thoro would bo a reduction of laillions in tlo expenses, whilo tho pcreased security could not bo csti- lated. bupposo a man's wealth rav- bhos tho famous galleries of tho old id and bears away their choicest lorksof art; suppose it stretches out is tentacles and draws from tlm tttar its sacred cloth; suppose for tho looms of tho old world ircavo their most delicato fabrics, luul tho most skillod artisans exhaust Rhoir talent in making of a hoo a Ipalaee: Does it bring .i.y proto Ition to tho luckv --vnor?

SUKi: TO C031K. Throughout tho oast tho anti- monopoly movement is gathering trength, as oaoh daj reveals some now onormity on the part of corpor ations as against the people. In our eastern exchangos wo learn that some prominent merchants of St. Louis aro oraranizinfr in behalf of a movement that must soon becomo gcnoral. They' proposo a freight bureau lor tho purpose of influencing railroad companies in the matter of cheap and uniform rates. Let tho companios bo wise in timo aud como gracefully ivii to a reform that will otherwiso be domauded in duo season in un mistakable terms.

Thero is room for but ono great monoply in this country, and that is a monopoly whose main business it shall be to establish justico and fair play. In a short timo tlfo pooplo of this terri tory, and in faot tho great southwest, will mako similar demands, and tho peoplo will look to but ono party for relief tho democratic Any ono who has traveled much in Arizona has bcon at times con sidorably disturbed by the yelping, whining, and when darkness covers all with its protecting shield, thosav ,ago barking of tho thieving, cowardly coyote. Ordinarly, little or no atten tion is paid to this mostcontomptihle and worthless of animals It is con sidered a common nuisance, and is not interfered with oxcopt, when era boldenod by non-iutcrfcrcnce, it mis takes tho contempt in which i is held for fear and pokes its snes iing nose within the boundaries of . the camp and attempts to steal a bone or a bit of bacon rind to appease its ravonous appetite On su.h occa sions a shout from a pai. of lusty lungs or a random shot in the air sonds tho midnight thief back into tho darkness, whero, safo from danger, it s.its on its lean and attenu ated hauuehc snarling and howling at its superiors. Too cowardly to fight, too insignificant to pursue, it roams, tho renegade of tho mesa, despised by its own species and held in abhorronco as tho synonym of all that is vicious, low and despicable. In Sunday's EriTAPii appeared a plain, torso statement, to tho effect that tho action of tho board of super visors in publishing for proposals for bids was done at the urgont advico of thoir logal advisor, tho district attorney. No respectable or honorable man in this community doubted tho truthfulness of tho Statomcnt, but a morning contemporary says: "Wo doubt tho statement, and will not be prepared to believe it until Mr. Prico corroborates it." When an honorable man doubts tho statement of another, ho does not call him a liar, as a black guard would, but seeks tho authority given for tho subject of his remarks, aud from him ascertains its veracity. This might have been dono without any troublo or lnconvenince by the manager or editor of tho paper re ferred to had ho so desired. In proof of this wo quc-io tho following conversation with tho Hon. Lyttlcton Prico, district attorney, with tho editor of tho Epitaph: "ilr. Pnce,do you yet adhero to your advico to tho board of supoivisors, that their action in advertising for proposals for bids is legal?" Mr. Prico: "I most cer tainly do. Without sueh an action on . . . ... .-' their part thero would bo tw three weeks, at least. .:. .i i , &$ nine uio uoaru racts co e tho rates al- under existing contraots. dviSed tho board to pursue this course last year, but they postponed advertising for proposals until Jan uary. True, thoy woro not much loser, as a majority of tho old con traits were ronowed; but had tho contracts been given to other bid deis, they would havo had to pay dearly foi thoir negligence Tho board of supervisor, of San Francis co, aro now doing tho samo as this bjaid,.and thoro is no law to tho contrary, and I think they woj)d bo remiss in their duties if they allowed tho present contracts tooxpiro with out advertising for now ones. The incoming board will have to do tho satin) in 1881, unless tho law is oh niged or amended by tin) legisla tuie, an-! tho board coming in in 1SS5 will stand in exactly the samo pobitiun as tho incoming board of 1S83. 'It is as board as it is long.' " i "Did anyone eonneotod with tho In- Impendent aSK your opinion on this subject?' "No, I mot M.

It won the battle, aud with out derisivo jeers or exultant cheers it quietly resumed ,hc "even tenor of its way," working ini a common cause, for tho good of our country. Had it lost, it would not have pleaded with its victors for susteuanco; it would not havo converted itself into a oharity or contribution box, but knowing it had battled in tho cause of justico and right would havo nailed its flag lo the masthead and sunk with its party or sailed with flying colors in tho opon sea of pros perity, which now, owing to its efforts, lies boforo it.

ISSUES. It is true that congress has not been convened for any length of time, but so far they appear to bo laying on thoir oars. It looks as though tho republicans have not ro covoicd from tho surprise adminis tered to them through tho last elec tion, and tho democrats aro calmly awaiting to claim judgment upon some error which their opponents may make. There aro some very live issues which either party may con sider without detriment to them selves and much benefit to the people. Among them we may mention that tho government has too much spend ing money, and too much of that sort of thing invites corruption. The taxes are so heavy that capital is embar rassed and cannot be as generous with labor as it would like. The prices of tho necessaries of life aro absurdly high, through tho rule of the monopolists, notwithstanding the fact that labor is cheap. 1 he monpo lists control the market, and the taxes control such small capitalists and business men as havo not that power. Small capital and largo work are thereby embarrassed to the last do grco, and this notwithstanding the fact, as pointed out in tho president's message and the accompanying docu ments, that thero have been good crops, largo business, and on the sur face an apparent abundance of pros perity. Too little attention has been and is yot being paid to the growing interests of tho territories especially Arizona. We want increased mail facilities, appropriations for the sur yey of thousands of acros of public land, appxopriions (or the sinking of artesian wellL the culture of trees, and above all, rRj passage of tho Re gan railroad bill -eventing discrimin ation in rates. These are a few points which congress should take up with out delay. There is not a man in the' country who is not interested in .them, and his family along with him. iThoy touch every person and every vAV-l..V i.t w.WMei'-T?" ..-- HVJ1( .1 . V" .' . -W. J- i"i which ho pays a merited rebuke to our present system of reservations, inferring that when the Indians are closely pushed in Mexico they inva riably take rofugo across tho border in our reservations, thereby furnish ing themsolves with a sure place of safety. It is an establishad fact that in caso of an uprisiug of tho savages in this territory they, after committing a series of depredations, cross the lino either into Sonora or Chihuahua, where they rob and murder tho peo ple, ami when closely pursued again rcoross the lino and mako for the res ervations, where thoy aro clothed and fed, putting them in shape for an othor sortie. If we were to adopt tho sjstem of shooting tho ringlead ors of theso savage desporadoos as soon as thoy returned from their trip of rapine aud murder, in a short timo thoy would becomo so thoroughly in timidated aud subjected that thoy would not mako many other excur sions. The following,carofully condensed, shows the opinions of tho leading pa- pors regarding the president's lato mossago: Herald: "An admirable, clear and business-like stato paper." Sun: "Made in the interest of honest and economical government." World: "Ho, Presidont Arthur, looks at pub lic questions with the eyes of an in telligent and public-spirited man; he proposes to deal with them in tho spirit of a time-serving politician." Star: "Shows that ho has heard of tho recent elections in the country and understands thoir meaning." Tri bune: "A creditable document. His sentiments aro admirable. If he had conducted his administration in ac cordance with them the party would not bo staggering under an adverse majority of nearly 200,000. Ho has always talked well."
