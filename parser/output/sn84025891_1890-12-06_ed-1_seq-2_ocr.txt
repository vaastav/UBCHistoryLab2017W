When honest men fall out thieves are some times benefited. We are glad to know that the Federal Election bill will become a law. Had the Senate passed the Fed eral Election bill the House would have been republican. The editor of the Petersburg Herald should not be so mouthy. What ails you Matt? We shall probably return to our new office on or about the 24th of this month.

In this weeks iBsue or the Bee appears the first letter of Louise to Clara. It is our intention to coufiue the writter strictly to so cial aud hauBehold matters. A "Triumvirate" iB a hateful combination to a fellow who has labored zealously to be a member of it, but failed for want of capaci ty to "get there Eli."

Let ua have home rule. t . a . cry of the race, therace" is the laBt refuge of a pygmy wno nnds nim eelf over matched by giants. "It is not in our stars, but in ourselves, dear Brutus, that we are underlings," Shakespeare was a marvelous judge of men and the above quotation commends itself with frightful force to the "Great Disappointed Disgruntled of to day. Oh, the Triumvirate ! 'Natute makes the marble, man makes the stature." But what shall we do with a man who with plenty of marble around him, has no capacity for statue making? Such a man though he may deplore his want of artistic ralent, should not spend his time growling at the real sculptors. Oh, the Triumvi rate. Bishop H. M. Turner, of the A, M. E, Church, declared in a recent address, that President Harrison had appointed a greater number of colored men to important offi. ceB, thau any mnn who had ever occupied the Preaidental Chair.

AGAIN URGES ACTION. In my last annual message I suggested that the development ol the existing law providing a Federal supervision of Con gressional elections oflered and effective method of reforming these abuses. The need of such a law has manifested itself in many parts of the country, and its wholesome restraints and penaltias will be useful in all. President Harrison's Message. More than once has the Presi dent called the attention of Con gress to the necessity of enacting adequate legislation for the pro tection of the citizens in the exer cise of the suffrage, but strane-e as it may seem, Congress has not heretofore acted upon these well tuned suggestions. But our eolons, to their credit be it said, haye at last been aroused and we feel con fident that they will now do their full duty. 

DONT LOSE THE CHANCE. Whenever an opportunity is of fered the colored people they should do all in their power to embrace it. Lota are being rapidly sold at Bow ie, Md., for $100 and if you want a bargain don't fail to call and see the plat. If you purchase now you can get a choice lot for 8100, bat if you don't purchase now you will have to pay $300. Your " title is guaranteed and we advise you all to purchase now. Call at this of fice or call and see Mr. Campbell Carrington. HE DEMANDS EQUALITY FOE, ALL MEN. Equality of representation and the par ity of the electors must be maintained, or everything that is valuable in our system of government is lost. The qualifications of an elector must be sought in the law, not in the opinions, prejudice?, or fears of any class, however powerful. The path of the elector to the ballot-box must be free from the ambush of fear and th entice ments of fraud; the countsotrue and open that none shall gainsay it. President's Message. 2S"o president, since the immor tal Lincoln, has uttered braver words than these; and no President has ever exhibited greater solici tude for the oppressed Afro-American. Ko President has ever been confronted with graver difficulties in times of peace; and no President has ever exhibited more capacity and courage in dealing with great problems. Go on, Pivsideut Benj amin Harrison! The Afro-Americans of the United States will stand by you. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's recent message to Congress is one of the most re markable public documents that has appeared for a long time and the comments of the daily press of the country shows the general fa vor with which it has been receiv ed. The Republican press endors ed it with enthusiasm, while the democrats are compelled to admit tnat it is a paper of rare merit. It presents and discusses with clear ness and force all the great issues now before the country, and calls upon Congress to enact the Ingisla tion necessary in the premises. He urges Congress to pass the Federal .Election bill to secure free aud fair elections throughout the country, and to protect every citi zen be he black or whitein the exercise of his perogatives. He recommends in language not to be misunderstood, that there shall be stand ny its colors. Tne effect ot this message is already seen in the action of the Senate, in taking up by a unanimous vote the Election Bill which was carried over from last session. It is clear that under the fearless leadership of President Harrison, the Congress now in ses sion will accomplish greater results before the 4th day ot March, 1891. 

LYNCH vs. TOWNSEND. Our esteemed Fourth Auditor, Mr. Lynch, lost his temper in his reply to Dr. Townsend and beggr ed the question in his report to Ex-Governor Kellogg. Mr. Lynch lost the beat opportunity of his life; he failed to show the strong points in the administration; he failed to show the great work that had been accomplished bv President Harrison since he ha's been President. While Mr. Lynch meant well his argument was weak. Why did'nt Mr. Lynch show beyond all doubt that Presi dent Harrison has made more Negro appointments than any President that has ever occupied the Executive chair; why didn't he Bhow that it was President Harrison who favored the passage of the Blair Educational bill. which would have educated mil lions of ignorant people; why didn't Mr. Lynch show that Presi dent Harrisou was the father of the Jederel Election bill and that he wanted it to become a law to protect all classes of voters in the United States. There were but few of the many noble acta of this administration showed up and since it was the intention and desire of Mr. Lynch to defend the administration, he should have embraced it in the opportunity that was given to him in his reply to Ex-Governnr TToi. loeg. There is a wav for Mr. T.vnoh to differ from Mr. TownBend and we are of the opinion that Mr. Lynch lost his case and injured himself. Of course we disagree with Eecorder Townsend; we know that Mr. Harrison is a noble man and we are surprised at Mr. Townsend whom we met at the Executive Mansion about one year ago and he said to ua in the presence of Sect'y., Halford, that he hoped that the colored people would not be too hard on the President, but have a little pa tience. Does Recorder Townsend remember thoae remarks? Mr. Lynch is only doing what you advocated one year ago, Mr. Townsend; you said then that the President would do more for our people.. Has not the President done mre Mr. Townsend? What is Mr. Townsend sore about? He wanted a bigger office or one with more salary attached to it; and failing to get it he is kicking against the administration. Bro. Townsend endeavored to bull doze the administration a tew months ago by sending a letter to Mr. Harrison threatening to re sign, if he was not given a better office. In this same letter Bro. Townsend attacked Mesars. Doug lass, and Lynch, but, he was ad vised to leave out the attack on these men, as it would injure his case. Recorder Townend followed the ins'ruction of his friends and struck out the abusive attack on these gentlemen. Mr. Townsend asked for a great many things in that letter that he didn't not get; the main favor he asked was a better office for hiraBelf. It is not the lTegro race that Mr. lownaend wants to see elevat ed; it is not the disappointed (?) office seekers in whom Mr. Towns end is interested; it is more sala ry or a bigger office for James M. Townsend and it is he who is playing the role of the hyprocrite. We challenge Mr. Townsend to a denial of our charges; and any re ply that he wishes to make the columns of the Bee are open to him.

RICHMOND DIVINE. (?) Rev.(?) W. W. Browne, of Rich mond, Va., who claims to control the colored of this city can be put down as a natural borne bombast. When he attempts to send a man from Richmond to dictate to the citizens he will find out that he has bitten off more than he chew. His organization known as the True Reformers will be, in a few days, remembered as a thing of the past. Hisgreat mistake was his unwar ranted attack on Rev. Robert Johnson, a man whom we all re nn"n nnA n rlivinQ in urhnm thft ueai mure eiauurateiy wnii the Bichmond Reformer who has at tempted to invade our cityand cause disention among some oar best cit izens. GIRLS BEHIND THE COUNTER. If I were to asked to give a set of rules or suggestions for girls whose days are spent behind the counter, they would read some thing like this : Remember that all the time spent in the store belongs to your employer. That courtesy behind the counter wins even the most captious cus tomers. That gossip about young men, or with them, is unbusinesslike, and unuer tne circumstances, rude. Never attempt to instruct a cus tomer; while you may suggest, or politely question, the desirability of this or that. Do not say, "Here Sade, hand me your pencil," to your neighbor Never say, "No, we haven't got it," in a short, crisp tone: far better a polite "I am sorry to say we do not have it in stock." Do not thrust a package at a customer as you would a pistol in the face of a highwayman. Never throw down goods with an air which seems to say, "I do not care whether vou buv if. nr nnt Remember that the purchaser often sees more in the seller than she thinks, and refined young women have made valuable friends for life by their courtesy to an accomplished customer. Always remember, that duty to your employer demands your best service, and duty to yourself also. Seek to be a model saleswoman, and some one will sonn rnonani your merits. Dress modestly and avoid cheap jewelry, the best ornaments are: promptness, politeness, a well-mod-ulated voice, and strict attention to duty. Have your hair neatly combed, your teeth well brushed and your finger-nails tidy. Customers are uneu repeuau oy untidy clerks of either sex. Remember always, that you are superior to circumstances, only when you make yourself so. The most selfish, exacting employer will gladly recognize the merita of an efficient clerk. Frown down with womanly scorn the nonsenical title of "saleslady.' It is a gran4 thing to be a woman anything; if you are a true and good woman, a good clerk is infin itely more respectable then a so called "saleslady," and the term has a sboddyish ring which is totally un-American. Out of two hundred clerks in a large establishment, the favorite with nearly all of the customers, is a young woman wno invariably dresses modestly in black, and has such charming manners that it is a positive pleasure to visit her de partment.
