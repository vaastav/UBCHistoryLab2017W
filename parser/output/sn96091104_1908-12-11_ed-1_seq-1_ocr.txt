As predicted in The Herald several days itiio Charles A. Parker, Cashier of the Jiaury National Bank, has been appointed disbursing agent for the government funds' here used In the construction of the postofflce build ing. Mr Parker received notice of his appointment from Washington Weilriesda , the appointment having been made at the Treasury depart ment last .Monday. This appointment is not only a nice compliment to Mr. Parker but it will CVP him ii nmci nmfn.ohlo olnopnro ...it, .1 IIIU.1L tU'LVI IHUIb UjllLVU' The work will be light although the responsibility of correctly and accu rately disbursing $50,000 of Uncle Sam's cash is considerable, and the pay will be according to the respon sibility and not the work. Hence the place is a most desirable one from every standpoint. Mr. Parker will execute the neces sary bond at once and it is expected that the work of paying out the funds will beyiii at an early date thereafter, Tl ... - jl-uq v. jaexsou has again been nominated for Postmaster of Colum bia by the President, his name hav ing been sent to the Senate on Tues day afternoon. Mr. Jackson has been postmaster here less than two years yet during that time he has been nom inated for the office by the President no less than four times. He was first nominated in May, lyQ7 to succeed Col. A. M. Hughes. This was a re cess appointment and when Congress met the following December his name was again sent to the Senate. Some time thereafter it was withdrawn by the President 'pending the investiga tion of certian charges against Mr. Jackson involving a violation of the civil service rules. The charges not being sustained the nomination was sent to the Senate for the third time. Congress adjourned shortly after Mr. Jackson's last nomination without confirming the appointment or taking any action .thereon and he has con tinued to 'hold. His commission, how ever, expired with the meeting of the Congress on Monday and his name was again sent to the Senate. Failing to prevent his nomination the political opponents of Mr. Jack son have sought to defeat his con firmation, but it is not believed that there is any chance for the success of such a movement and it is expected that before the Congress adjourns in March he will be confirmed. When his nomination is confirmed a new commission, good for four years, will be sent to the postmaster, so that his first term, as a matter of fact, will extend for nearly six years. It will not expire until just before the ex piration of Taft's term as President.

MYSTERY SURROUNDS CRIME Family Say He Was Slain By Burglar, But Police Dectare Death Suicide. ST. LOUIS. Dec. 8. Francis I). Jlirsehberg, prominent in the Roman Catholic Church, and a personal friend of Archbishop Ulennon, also well known in club and business circles, and as a director of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, was shot and killed at his home here early today. Whether his deuth was the result of murder or suicide has not been deter mined. Members of the family aver that he was the victim of a burglar. The police investigators take the oth er view, declaring that there was no evidence of the presence of intruders in the home. A trail of bloodstains on the stairway leading from the re ception hall on the first floor indicated that Mr. Hirschberg was shot at the foot of these stairs and then turned and walked back to his bedroom on the second floor. From there he crossed a hallway and passed through his wife's room to the bath room. As he returned, staggering into his wife's room, Mrs. Hirschber awoke just in j time to see him sink to the floor un- scious, according to statements made ENORMOUS YIELD IRISH POTATOES RETURNS OF TWELVE ACRES ON C.

Almost 200 Barrels, Some Were Sold For $2 Per Barrel. I1 records on the returns from Maury county farming lands were broken this year by C. R. Denton of Glendale, who sold the crops from twelve acres for a total of $4,352.00, or an average of $362.60 an acre, and. It is almost safe to say that the record on a plot of ground as large has not been equaled in the state this year. Mr. Denton planted the laud in Irish, potatoes and the flrs't crop yielded 1,323 barrels. He sold 1104 barrels of, merchantable jiotatoes from these to C. D. Park of Culleoka at $1.75 a bar rel, or a total of $1,932.00, and sold in addition 220 barrels of seed potatoes at $1.00 a barrel. The yield from the second crop of Irish potatoes on the same land was 1,100 barrels, which. Mr. Denton has sold for spring deliv ery to F. F. Clawson for $2.00 per bar rel. One acre of the land overflowed during the second planting or the crop would have been larger. Mr. Denton estimates that with the re moval of about fifty stumps in a part of this it would produce as high as 150 barrels of potatoes an acre on a single crop.
