JOSr.ril TOLAND, PuWIaher, Tlio l'resldeut's Hcssage. rresident Arthur's first annual message to congTess was given to the public a week ago. The document haa probably bad a Iarger number o readers than any simllar state paper for a long term of years. Ita appearance had been anticipated by all par- tlcs wltu mlngled feehngs of hope and fear, interest and curioaity. So far aa hls admln !strationt assuuied under circumstancea of unparallolcd difficulty and embarrasament, had developed hls quality aa president up to the tlme of the meetlngof congress, be bad vindlcated the hlgh confldence of hls friends and dlsappoinled the apprehenalons of his enemles. Ilia oftjeial acts had shown wla dom and disarmed opposltlou, and he had malntalned silence, discreet and profound, as to the undecided matters of hls adminls- tratlon. He had kept hla counsol so closely as to the contenta of the message. whlch under f ormer prealdenU by various Ingenlous devices had often been dlsclosed to the pub- lic ln adrance of its presentatlon to con gress, that the paper had all tho freshness and interest of a new norel. Conslderation of the circumstances nnder wbich be becaine president, the rare tact and wisdom he had displayed in tbe office, and the distlnction he had won as the " ai lent man " whoso inteutions could not be penetrated oven by tbe dlamond drill of the expert polltlcian or interviewer, had creabed a degree of expectancy in the public tnind concerning the message, simllar to that which waited for the inaugural of bis mar, tyred predecessor. The message was iu fact I'resident Arthur's inaugural address, and for lt peoplo wero anzlously waiting to see if there was promlse that the new hopes and expectallons which the president had excited would be sustained by the formal announce ment of the polioy that would guide hls ad- ministration of the government. To thoae wbose conceptlon of a great state paper is a document swelllng witlt buncotnbe, tbe mes sage may be disappointing. What people want from their rulers is information. Tbis I'resident Arthur bas glyen them briefly but in a full measure. Tbe mossage is long because it includea many tblugs. On no slngle topiois there undue prolixityof treat ment. Unimportant matters are dlamissed with a terso and suggestire sentenco or two, wbile graver subjects aro treated wlth a degree of elaborateness proportioned to their lmportance. As a whole the prosl dent's stateinent of the coudltion of the gen- nral government is olear, pointed, succlnct, systematlo and comprehenslve. The brain of an accompllshed man of affalrs is seen in it all, and matured tbought is vlsible in Its treatment of debated questlons. Its ar ray of good polnta, its business-llke nual! ties, its candor, ita good sense, 1U souudness on all Important questiona, Its calm and patriotio toue bare won for the message a cordlal and practloally unanimous endorse ment frotn democrats and from republicans of all deslgnations. Such a chorus of praise 1 i and satisfaotion oyer a presldential message has not gone tip from Iho press doring the rocoucction of any aetlve cltizen now llr- ing. The clearnoss, forco and dignlty of its iiterary composition, as woll as Its subject matter, comtnitnd tho respoct and extort warm commendatlon from sources unaccus- tomod to exlol Mr. Arthur, or to bestow their approval upon anything emanatlng from republlcan sources. If any liroadslilos had been loadod for tho president he lins effcctually drawn their ammunlllon and turned them to salutos in his lionor. Subjects of l'opnlnr Interest. On two matters of siieclal popular Inter est tho slar routo prosocntions and the Mormon nuestlon the president speaks out with dcclslyo vlgor, and a third, clyll sorvlce roform, lio diseussos with a freedom and candor that will win respoct for tho sincer ity of hls purpose eren from thoso wlio will doubtlcss crltlcise bis poaitlon on tho mttch debated questlon, how to improve and reg ulate tlila oxtenslve branch of the gorern ment servlce. The star routo f rauds are to be prosccuted with the utinost vlgor of tho law. Tho obstaclos which havo operated to render inelTectual past legialation agatnst polygamy are revlewed by tho prosident, and legislatlon designed to overcome thoae obstacles is recommended. l'ast presidents havo doubtless done all that could bo ef fectcd under the law to break up polygamy, and Mr. Arthur gires an assurance, the grim earnestness of which no one can doubt, of hls purpose to co-operate in any lawful and discreet efforls to sunpross this in- iqulty. Ovor certaln specified matters the general government bas the superior control. Others, llke marriage and dlvorce, are lef t to the state or territorlal jurisdiction. In tho abscnce of the power of the general govern ment to enact laws regulating marriage and divorce in all the states, and in a certain laxity of popular sentiment on tbese sub jects, from whlch it ls barely posslble that even government legislators and oflicials are not entirely exempt, may possibly be found the sccrct of the fallure to blast tbe foundation stono of Mormonism. Tbe un- denlable tendency of state legislatlon has been to make divorce easy, to treat the mar riage contract loosely rather than to buttress it with protectivo laws. Theso Mormons aro shrewd observers, and it would not be surprising if, in their defiance of such laws as tbe fedcral government has aimedagainst polygamy, that they have banked on a fel- low feeling which may have made federal ofliclals and even law-makcrs wondrous kind toward the pecullar institution even whlle loudly inveighing agalnst it. The iniquity will not be removed by vapid de nunclatlon. Wiilo the press, tbe pulpit and the government, have been fulminating their bulls agalnst thts comet of direful Import, the baleful visitant has been spread ing over the westem horizon, as President Arthur shows. If the powers of the gov ernment are not strong enough to remove the curse, the evident way is to enlarge them to meet the emergency. In view of the fact that for more than a third of a century Mormonism has steadily grown in power and in capacity to defy the government, it is evi dent there is a weakness somewhere eithor in the power itself of the government or the diapositlon of the oflicials to exercise it. What is nceded is less declamation and more definite knowledge as to tbe means and power the government has or must have effectually to blot out the disgrace, and then a stern, unrelenting exercise of that power. A Sacrlllco to Apollo. The flames have claimed a fearful holo- caust of buman victims in the distant capi- tal of Austria. Within the walls of tbe liing theater in Vienna the audience was gatherlng, Thursday evening, the 8th in stant, to wilness the performance of a popu lar opera. Nearly two thousand people had assembled a few minutes before seven o'clock, the hour for the performance to be gin, when, by the carelesa upsetting of a larap on tbe stage, as nearly as can be as certained, the scenery and tho stage trap- pings were suddenly ignited. An iron cur tain, to separato the stage from the audlto rium, had been provided for such an emer gency, but no one seems to have had the presenco of mind to lower it. The galleries of the theater had become well filled, and the parquet seat-owners were rapidly arriv ing. The entrances to the galleries are de scribed as having been so narrow that two persons could hardly walk abreast in tbem. Immediatcly after the alarm was given the gas was turned off, and the struggling and terrified audience were left groping in total darkness to flnd their way out. Oil lamps are required by the laws to be kept buming nightly in the passageways to guard agalnst the dauger that would come in a panic from tbe extlnguishment of the gas, but tbis re- quirement had long been dlsregarded. The flames soon burst into the auditorium, and scene of unparaileled horror ensued. Xrarly two thousand people, frautio with terror, were struggling through the darkness and suDocating smoke to make tbelr exit from the theater. The doors from the gal leries, designed to facilitate the emptying of the theater in a time of special peril, opeued inwaru, and thus even tbose that could be un- locked were rendered useless. The press of the masses agalnst them blocked the avennes of escape. Many made their way to the wlndows, and, leaping thence, were caught in the streets below on Bheets or netting. In the passageways the press became so great that they were effectually blocked up by the mass of humanity cruslied and wedged in their narrow labyrinths. The flro department came tardlly to the rescne, and with insufScient means elther for ex tlnguishlng flre or saving llfe. Kvery pre cautlon agalnst flre or for protecting life seems to have miscarried, and had a trap been deslgnedly set to accomplisb the death of two thousand people, more effective means could hardly have been devised. It ls esti tnated that more than one thousand human beings have, in tbis disaster, fallen victims to the most culpable negligence of the man agers of the theater, and the grossest dlsre- gard of existlng laws on the part of the mu- nlcipal oflicials. In filtocn minutes a greater mortallty was eflected than has occurred in many notable battles. All Vienna ls ln mourning. On Sanday the victims who have been rocovered were given a public burial with imposing ceremoniea. The de talls of inulilatlon in the press and by the flames are too horrible to describe. It is re latedthat a New York merchant had at- tended a matinee in this theater on tbe afternoon of Thursday, and that on regaln ing the street at ita close vowed that he never agaln would take his famtly into nuch a trap. Jlapplly the mortallty among Americans, aa far as learned, is confined to a slngle case. As there is a large number of American medlcal students in Vienna, it was reaaonably feared that tbe 11st of casu altles might be a long one. I'akty Ascendanov. Slx years ago the houae of representatives was organized wlth a democratlo majority, after having been lield by the republlcan party for sixteen years, Now it is restored to republlcan control by a bare majorlty. ilie senato, also, is now republicau uy a still more precarious Un ure. At each congressional election the democratlo majority was reduced, untll now lt has dlsappeared.

The same rate of voting if carried Into a state canvass wlth strict conslstency would elect a prohibition governor. The rato of progross is woll ln dlcated by tho fact that in 1880 the problbi, tlonists of the entlro state cait only 082 votes for presldential electors, aud in 1870 the total was even smaller. In tho gnber natorial contests of 1870 and 1880 the pro hlbltionists east about 1,500 votes, or hardly any more than Newton, New liedford or SpringGeld alone in the recent tournament A Fearless Jddqf;. ln a chargo to the grand jury of Yazoo county, Mlsaisslppl, on the 28th ult., Judgo Calhoun suggestlvely said that for slx years he had charced the grand juries in bis dlstrict ten times each year, and had said and was still of the same oplnion, and no man, not even the judgo or foreman of the jury, had any assurance, so far as tho protection afforded by the law ls concemed, that upon leaving the court houso bis brains would not bo blown out and the perpetrator of the deod go nnpunlshod. If the culprlt was a man of wealth and lnfluence, the chances were seven out of ten that the law would not be enforced ; lf a poor, inslgnificant man, the law would be as grossly vlolated the other way and a mob would hang hlm. In either case the effect was the same a total dlsre gard for the law. This state of affalrs, he said, was most rulnous in its Influences upon socloty, and indicated a diseased pub llo sentiment, utterly opposod to true civill zatlon. tNDCSTnious. The thought that im- presses itself upon tho careful reader of I'resident Arthur's message is one of aston ishment that within tbe few short and hur ried weeks whlch bave passed since he became president he could have so effectually mastered the difficult and intricate dutios of hls office as not only to state the conditlon of the varied affairs of the government so exbaustlvely and so comprehensively, but to discusa with rare force and soundness questions of tbegreatost moment. It is true that much of the message is made up of abstracts from department reports, but in thoso portions of the document wbicb give it its decisivo character the hand and the individuality of the president himself are plainly dlscernible. The message ls in the highest degree complimentary to its au tbor's industry, ability aud qulckness to grasp and comprehond matters of tbo great est variety and gravest importance. An Knolisii Omnion. The Iondon Puck thus talks of Guiteau : " He ls simply a crank, such as we see here every week. He Is no lunatlc. He knows very well what he is dolng. He tells us that the Lord com missioned him to shoof I'resident Garfield. He knows very well the Ijrd would never have commisslon&d bim to shoot a man who could draw as qulckly as he could. The man who is sane enough tocower before tbe popular fury is sane enough to hang for the commission of a cruel and dastardly crime. II any cheap sentiment clears this worst of mnrderers from the gallows, it ls to be hoped that the undisciplined and law despising public whicb will take care of the murderer will also have an eye to tbe jury which acquits him. We do not believe in lyncb law ; but if we did, we should send thirteen pieces of hemp to Washington the day Gui teau is acqultted." .Nox.Pautisan The non-political char acter of the president's message is one of its most gratifying features. Ilverv topic is discussed from a standiioint that is hitrh above partisan considerations. l'articularly gratifying and suggestive is the disappear ance of the " southern question " which bas been a stock topic for presldential messages in the years of bitter political strife that have passed. " No north, nb south, no east, no west" is dlscoverable throughout the message. Measures honestly believed to be for the good of all the people and for the perpotulty of the whole unlon engage the attentlon of the president. I'olitics or sec tionalism is as remote from view in the document as in the nation after the assassin had fired bis dastardly shot on that July day. The chastening of the great sorrow has done its perfect work. SrcnETAnv Frelingu uysen. On Mon, day I'resident Arthur nomlnated ex-Senator Frederick T. Frelinghuysen of New Jersey for secretary of state, and the senale unani mously confirmed him. Mr. J. C. Ilancroft Davis wlll be first assistant secretary of state. Our foreign affairs will be entirely safe in the hands of men like theso. The appointment of his chief secretary from a state politlcally democratlo shows the non partisan and independent spirit which has thus far actuated the president. In this re- spect he is ranking liigh above bis prede cessors. He haa placed the principal de partmenta of the government, the state and the treasury, in the hands of men of bigb ability and of conservative tendencles, rather than of merely brilliaut and magnetic qual ities. SrniNQFiELn HepuUican says : "Colonel Hooker of Ilrattleboro, Vermont, wbo has been made sergeant-at-arms of the bouse, is botu companlonable and clever. Ile mar. ried a slster of the late Jim Fisk, aud the two men were great cronies. Hooker was a guest of Fisk's on one of hls special car junkets, and the train passed a load of porkers. ' Look hero, George,' cried Fisk, 'lots of your relatlves travellng to-dayl' ' Yos,' returned Hooker cheerfully, 1 connec- tlons by marriage.'

It is said that a large number of men havo been appolnted to clerkships in Wash ington on the gronnd that they are veter ans of the late war, who are impostors.
