It was issued November 5, four days after mine (very evident ly 1 could not have 'cribbed from him). I no ticed at the time that he used three or four sen tences of my proclamation. I felt, however. complimented, and said nothing to anyone ex cepting my private secretary, who was at my side when the proclamation was received and read. On the morning of November 20. at about lu o clock. I received a telegram from the Cin cinnati Post, calling my attention to the simi larity or the two proclamations.

A WRONG IMPRESSION. aTapaa Doss Mot Propose to BeeaU Her Protest Against the Annexatloa of Ha waiiWhile Maintaining; Amicable Rela tions with the United States She will Stand Firmly for Her Treaty Klfhta Against HawalL Omaha, Neb., Dec 9. Toru Hoshi, Japanese minister to the United States, passed through Omaha last evening en route to Washington, accompanied by his private secretary. In an interview with a representative of the press. Mr. Uosbi admitted that the object of his mission to Japan was to ascertain the views of his government on the pro posed annexation of Hawaii and to procure instructions from the mikado relative to tbe course he was expected to pursue in case the treaty shall be ratified by congress. "The impression has gone out to the American press," said Mr. Hoshi, "that we propose to recall the protest en tered by Japan against the acquisition of the Sandwich islands by the United States government. This is mislead ing and untrue. Japan has always maintained amicable relations with the United States, and it is not our purpose now to take any steps that would lead to a breach of mutual good will; but at the same time Japan will stand firmly in the maintenance of its rights and privileges acquired under treaty with the Hawaiian government. If the United States government de cides to annex Hawaii, we hope to be b.ble to enforce our demands for in demnity for the violation of treaty rights in the expulsion of Japanese im migrants from the island and their ex clusion from the right! acquired under our treaty." Concerning President McKinley's message, especially as referring to the relations of Japan and the United States in connection with the proposed annexation of Hawaii, Mr. Hoshi de clined to express any views beyond re iterating what he stated at the outset, that there would be no disposition on the part of Japan to resist the ac quisition of Hawaii by the United States, but that he hoped to be able, through diplomatic negotiations, to bring about a peaceful solution of the matters in controversy. 

DURRANT'S LAST HOPE. It Is Dispelled by the Action of tbe Su preme Court. Sax Fran'cisco, Dec 9. Late yester day afternoon the supreme court dis pelled the last hope of W. II. T. Dur rant, the murderer of Blanche Lamont aud Minnie Williams by disposing in a summary manner of his two appeals. In a written opinion, from the pen of Chief Justice Beatty, which is con curred in by all but one of his asoci ales, the court affirms the judgment of Judge Bahcrs. in remanding the prisoner to San Quentin until the date set for his execution, but reverses the sentencing of Durraut to be hanged on November 11 and remands the case to the superior court with instructions to proceed ac cording to law. As the remittor was ordered issued forthwith, and the court holds thatexecution can only be stayed now by the issuance of a certificate of probable cause, it only remains to re sentence the condemned murderer, which will probably done to-day. Justice Garoutte alone dissented from this opinion, maintaining that Durrani's appeals should have been dis missed, as the time required by law foi their perfection had been allowed to lapse. MONEY ORDER BUSINESS. An Encouraging Indication or the Prevailing- Volnme of Business. New York. Dec 9. In the mail bags which went out on the St. Paul yester day were 9,000 foreign money orders. amounting to 24,554. These orders are for Christmas presents, and most of them go to Norway and Sweden. This is the first large batch of for eign money orders that has gone out this year. The first orders each year go to Norway and Sweden. About a week later those intended for German friends are sent, and after them go the orders sent to Great Britain and Ire land. The money order certificates to France come last, presents being sent for new year, according to the custom there. The money order business in the New York post office this year is about double that of the last holiday season. There were 20,000 money orders han dled Tuesday as against 10,000 on the corresponding day last year. Of these. 11,000 were domestic orders, amounting to S50.144.

A POLL OF CONGRESS. The Most Vital Questions Now Before tha Country How the Two Hoosas BtaadV on Them General Besolss of a Poll Taken by a Representative of the New York Journal and Advertiser on Direct. Propositions. New York, Dec 9. A special to the Journal and Advertiser from Washing ton says: "A reporter having made a poll of congress upon the most vital ques tions to come before that body at this session, below is given the exact ques- -tions submitted to the members. The following proposition was sub--mitted to the members of the house: "Do you favor retirement of the green backs?" The surprise in the vote upon this proposition was in the fact that such republicans as Belknap. Dolliver,. O'Dell. Henderson. Mesick, Bruce and. Hopkins were found in opposition.. Not a single populist, of course, fav ored tbe proposition, while Brenner, of Ohio, and Kitchen, were the only democrats in its favor. The following propositions were sub mitted to the senate: "Can any radical legislation, involv ing the retirement of the greenbacks,, the limitation of the legal tender qual ity of silver, or the issuing of goldi bonds for the retirement of green backs, pass the senate?" There was practically a unanimous sentiment that nothing can be done. On this poll there was not an affirma tive vote. The negatives were largely in the majority, and the donbt ex pressed by certian senators virtually meant a negative. To the senate upon the matter of an nexation this proxsition was submit ted. "Do you favor the annexation of Ha- -waii?' Not a single straight republican was - found in opposition, but Cannon and Pettigrew, the silver senators, voted in. favor of it All the leaders of the dem ocratic party were opposed, with the exceptions of Morgan, Pettus, Rawlins and Turpie. The exact form of the vote taken upon the question of arbitration was. in is: "Do you favor the adoption of a gen eral arbitration treatv with Great Britain?" Among the republicans found in the negative here were Elkins, Frye and. Baker, going with Cockrell. Mills, Morgan and Murphy among the lead ers of the democrats. The great lights in the republican party who leaned toward an affirmative view were Alli son, Foraker, Hale, Hanna, Ilawley, . Morrill and Hoar. But many of the senators who wished to be recorded in . the affirmative qualified their declara- -tions as to exactly what such a treaty -should comprise and what its exact conditions should be. Upon the Cuban question, these two. propositions were submitted to mem bers of the house of representatives: "Do you favor the joint resolution passed by the senate at the extra ses sion declaring that a state of war ex ists in Cuba?" "Do you favor a resolution acknowl edging the independence of Cuba?" The first proposition seemed to meet with the views of the greater portion . of tbe known friends of tlie insurgents, although the republicans were far be hind the democrats in numbers. Among those on the republican roll who voted for the proposition were Belknap, Boutelle, Danfor'h, Daven port, Dorr, Grow, Henry, ol Indiana; Bobbins, Stevens and Overstreet. All the democratic leaders favored it, such men as Bailey, Benton, Bland, Ermentrout and Tay lor, of Alabama, being found among the positive friends of belligerency for the gallant patriots of Spain's be leagnred colony. Friends of Cuba appeared to be a bit sby of the bold suggestion of Cuban independence, probably for the reason that the first proposition, having passed the senate, affords the means of more direct action, and through the fear that the congressional recognition of Cuba's independence might lead to complica tions with Spain, which the other move would avoid.
