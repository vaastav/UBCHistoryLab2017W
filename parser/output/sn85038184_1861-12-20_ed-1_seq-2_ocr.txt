MUIU be the best thing that could happen. With six hundred thousand men now in' thc'f-Old,' our generals might possibly find something else to do than catch a negro now andthen, and as Kngland'has no negroes to catch, perhaps a war with her would not be carried on exactly as it hay been with her tory allies in the South. ' -:yr ., This war ought" to have 'been, and but for the fear of offending a few pre tended Union slaveholders, it would have been, closed up long ago, and. this new horror would have been avoided. .

'.'"'The' Wheeling Intelligencer is one of the -very best papers published. It has become most thoroughly imbued with the- great truth that slavery,- is not only a crime in the individual practicing it, but is'an intolerable incubus upon the State which permits it. tha Intelligent cer is an earnest advocate for the divis ion of the State, and with an honest in-; dependence, it places its advocacy upon the broad and statesman-like policy of universal freedom. In the bounds of the, proposed new State there, are but "few slaves and the Intelligencer advocates their emancipation. ' There is now an effort being made to attach what is called the "Valley of Virr gfuia' to the proposed new State. But this "Valley" has many slaves, and for that reason the Intelligencer protests. It says: "For our part, we can say that we hope to escape the affliction of being united witn tno vaney noiwuusiana ingthe many loyal people that are there, and the two or thre loyal counties that voted to go with us. The greater portion of the Valley are as antagonistic to-ims- West as ever was the tide-water region. .

That Is a move in the right direction. Let the Convention carry into effect the spirit of the above, and "Kanawha," or Western Virginia, will become one of the brightest stars in our constella tion; There are, we believe, but about eight thousand slaves in all the territory proposed to be inc'uded in the new State. It would be the most unfor tunate calamity which could befall the peoplo, n,ot anjy of that Stato, but of the Union, to have slavery continued thorein. ' With this principle (slavery) incor porated in their Constitution and laws, no matter what; the number of slave holders there might be, perpetual dis cord will be inauguaratcd. It were in finitely better for the people that they pay, even five times the value of the slaves,, than to - curse their posterity with the pestilential institution. Out of the nearly half a million of citizens in the proposed new State, less than one thousand arc slaveholders. Yet such is the nature of the institution, that, if tolerated atiill, the one thousand slaveholders must, and will, control the half million of ion-slaveholders. To maintain the-system, no matter how few tfie number, requires a system of legis lation utterly antagonistic to the in terests of free labor and free institutions. ; , Tlae Way it "Works. The telegraphic dispatch from Cairo, o a the 2d inst, coutains the following items: , W, "Three negroes from bolow, presented themselves to the picket guard at Bird's Point about noon to-day, and were taken before Col. Oglesby, commanding Bird's Point, who ordered them sent back through the lines, icith orders not to return again., llis . (Col. Oglesby s) action, iu this matter was based upon general order No. 3. issued by Major General lialleek. The report that Jeff. Thompson has four hundred negroes working on Jortiji cations at Aeu Madrid is confirmed. Thompson has one thousand men under his command. A number of the largest caliber guus are being mounted at Fort Holt and other points here." Now that may be very "conservative," LWt.fr. ijlfvf -Vi.m it n ncuc i - .r a4fti..a it looks to us in ore like the fatuity of fa naticism, if nothing worse, than the ju dicious management of a loyal com mander. Here is the rebel, Gen. Jeff. Thomp son," impressing the negroes to build fortifications having then 400 of them at work. It is known that they are forced to w-ork for the rebels against their will; and notwithstanding they have been driven into the service af the en emy, by our policy, ever since Fremont was superceded, yet still they come to our camps. Here we have the treatment they receive at the hands of one of our Generals. Aud what must be the effect. Why, we change them from friends into mortal enemies? . We make it their interest to carry information to the rebels, and Itave them no alternative but to build the fcrtiScations from which our brave volunteers are slaughtered by the thou sand? We confess oar patience becomes ex hausted at the repetition of this insane "negrophobia." Gin, that ?uan be loyal at heart who will deliberately sacrifice the lives of whole columns of white volunteers, and put . in jeopardy the -very country iu whose service he pro fesses to be, to gratify the paltry preju dice against negroes, imbibed in the petty contests of partisan politics. Anybody, kod Lord! The rebels are in great straits. Some times a slave who is about to be sold, is allowed to hunt up a master, and it is considered a very high privilege. And it is said that the greatest annoyance generous hearted man at the South has to endure, is the imporiunate begging of these slaves that he would buy them. The South is just now in the condi tion of one of these slaves. She wants to find a master! A sprig of English royalty has been her ambition. But becoming desperate, the Richmond Ex aminer prays most piiiously for either an English, French or Russian Prince to become the master of the land of chivalry, rather than suffer it again to be restored to the Union! Alas! we fear the prayer will not be ! eianted! And that secessia will hardly find yen among the younger sons of , ' , , u:i:. p n, tbe Irrupt d rotten nobility of the , old world, a scamp so desperate as to take them into his service.

It is also reported that the city of Charleston, S. C, was destroyed by fire, and that the negroes who, were com pelled to work the engines broke them and rendered them useless. It is also reported that the rebels are obstructing the navigation of the river at Columbus, Ky., by filling the channel with chains and anchors. We should not be astonished to hear that there has been a great review of our army on the Potomac before long. As to a battle, we will report it when it oc curs. - A battle occurred at Cheat mountain, iu Virginia, between Gen. Milroy on our side, with eighteen hundred Ohio and Indiana and Virginia troops, and a lot of rebels, in which it is said bur side gained a splendid victory. ' The fire was kept up until evening, when our forces were called off, intending to op--ture the whole rebel force the next day. But, strange to say, the next day there was no rebel force tc capture, as they had ran away in the night. :.Our loss was, twenty killed and thirty-four wounded. The loss of the enemy may have been very large. By this brilliant achieve ment the rebels are again driven clear out of AVestern Virgiuia. The rebel gunboats, and a large num ber of rebel troops, have left Columbus, Ky.,' for Xew Orleans, to defend that city from the attack of the U. S. forces If it were not for fear of "firing the. Southern heart" aud preventing a "compromise," it would seem to be a good time for the two hundred thou sand Federal troops now in that State to capture those that are left. But we suppose it would not be in ac cordance ' with the programme of the war to do anything of that sort. Intense excitement is said to prevail all through the South. The rebels feel quite sure that Enngland and France will join them immediately in the over throw of the Government. They may, and from appearances they probably will, join in the attempt, but its final overthrow is another thing entirely. In the history of the worl d, since the world has had a history, there was never such an army congregated as we have now in the field. With half the number of men, and not one tenth of the money and munitions,, the conquerors of the earth have swept over the prostrated nations, with a resistless tread. Our army of six hundred thousand men eat their rations and draw their pay, and aic getting a good "ready," probably, to go into winter quarters. - The painful conviction is forced upon us, that imbecility has formed a partner ship with treachery, and between the two, as between the upper and the nether mill-stones, the country is being ground to powder. We hope for some relief from this in tolerable state of things on account of the threatening aspect of our foreign affairs. It will cost us no more to fight England and France, than it docs to keep our present armies iu their camps. Not an other man is needed, if we have officers competent to lead them, and if we have not, moro men would only add to our weakness. We have as many men in the field now as both parties had when the fate of Europe hung upon the bat tle of Waterloo. If properly directed the number is far larger than is needed to meet all the nations of Europe. And if the threatening aspect of our foreign affairs shall arouse our rulers into enr rgy, good; and if it takes actual war to arouse them, if they arc capable of being aroused, then in God's name give us the war-! Any relief from thus standing paralysed in the presence of a handful of traitors.' If we are fit to be free and have a country, there are meu and meaus enough now collected to insure to us our country and our freedom against all the foreign despots and domestic traitors in existence. - And if we are only fit for slaves, let the-fact be known at once, that we may choose our masters, if a choice be permitted, or bow our necks to whoever may win us in the raffle. A Good Idea. The Union men of New Orleans have hit upon a capital method of conveying intelligence to the fleet at the mouth of the river. They enclose their communi cations in sealed Lotties, and drop them into the river, which carries them to our fleet. Good! We will bet a ninepence that the idea is a Yankee invention! Gen. Rosecrans. We learn, from the Wheeliug Intel ligencer, that Gen. Bosecrans has de termined to remove the headquarters of the army of Western Virginia to Wheel ing. He is probably established there before this time. BgSevoral communications, and oth , er matters, crowded out. - tiue ejigiI8I1 news im baltdiork. Baltimore, Dec. IG.

Our readers w ill therefore have patience. Here is some of themore important proceedings up to th,is date:: "Washington, Dee. 2. Senate. The Vice President called the Senate to order at noon-. About forty members were present. ' ' On motion of Mr. Hale of New Hamp shire, twelve o'clock was fixed for daily sessions. . On motion of Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, a message was ordered to be sent to the House that a quorum of the Senate was present, and was; ready to proceed to business. -An adjourned recess was then taken. I he senate concurred in the resolu tion of the House for the appointment of the joint CouKnUJtfpft Trumbull, of Illinois, and Latham of California. p. . Mr. Trumbull -gave notice that-he would introduce a bill to-morrow' to confiscate the property of rebels, and to give freedom to; persons in the Slave btates. U Mr. Wilkinson,Vof Minn., gave notice or a bill to abolish - the distinction be tween the regular and volunteer forces. The Committee appointed to wait on the President, reported he would com municate his message to Congress to morrow at noon. Adjourned. House. Opened with prayer. The roll was then called. One hundred and fourteen members answered to their names: Mr. Lovejoy, of 111., offered a joint resolution, tendering the thanks of Con gress to Capt. Wilkes, for his arrest of the traitors Slidell and Mason. Mr. Edgerton, of Ohio, moved as a substitute, that the President present Capt. Wilkes with a gold medal with suitable emblems and devices, express ive of the high sense of confidence en tertained for him by Congress, in his prompt arrest of the rebels Mason aud Slidell. The substitute waa rejected and the original resolution adopted. Mr. Blair offered the following as a question of privilege: Resolefil, That John K. Reed, mem ber of the House from the Fifth Con gressional District of Missouri, having taken up arms against the Government of the United States, is hereby expelled from the House, and that the Speaker notify the Governor of Missouri of the fact. The resolution passed. Mr. Colfax, (of Ind..) offered the fol lowing: Whereas, Michael Corcoran, who was taken prisoner at Manassas, has, after suffering other indignities, been confined by the sebel authorities in the cell of a convicted felon; therefore, Resolved, That the President of the United States be requesffed to similarly confine James S. Mason, late of Virginia, now iu custody at Fort Warren, until Col. Corcoran shall be treated as the United States have treated all prisoners taken by them on the battle-field. Applause in the galleries- The resolution was uuanituously adopted. Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, offered the following resolution: Resolved by (he House of Representa tives, First. That iu behalf of the peo ple is the States, we do again solemnly declare that the war in which we are now engaged, against the insurgent bodies now in arms against the Govern ment, has for its object the suppression of such rebellion and the re-establishment of the rightful authority of the National Constitution and Laws over the entire extent of our common country. Second. That while we disclaim all power under the Constitution to inter fere, by ordinary legislation with the institutions of the several States, yet the war now existing must be conducted ac cording to the usages and rights of mil itary service, and that during its con tinuance the recognized authority of the maxim that the safety of the State is the highest law, subordinates right of prop erty, and dominates over civil relations. Third. That therefore we do hereby declare, that in our judgment the Presi dent of the United States, as the Commander-in-Chief of our army, and the officers in command under him, have the right to emancipate all persons held as slaves in any military district in a state of insurrection against the Na tional Government, and we respectfully advise that such order of emancipation be issued whenever the same will avail to weaken the power of rebels in arms, or to strengthen the military power of the loyal forces. Mr. Dunn of Ind., moved to lay the resolution on the table, but the motion was disagreed to, by yeas 56, against 77. The question recurring on 51c. Eliot's resolution, Mr. Conkling of New York proposed an amendment, which Mr. Eliot accepted, so as to make the reso lution apply to the slaves of disloyal citizens. On motion of Mr. Stevens of Pa., the further consideration of the resolution was postponed until to-morrow week, in order that it may be discussed and amendments submitted. He was in favor of the main features of the proposition, but desired modification- . . , Mr. Campbell gave notice he would call up the following on next Tuesday week-: Resolved, That in legislating to meet the exigencies of the present rebellion, Congress should confiscate property, slaves included, of all rebels, and pro tect the property and rights, under the Constitution and laws, of all loyal citi zens I Mr. Stevens submitted the louowing ; for consideration: j Whereas, Slavery has caused the ! present lebelliou in the United States; i mrl wViprpas there can be no solid and "rL, t nace and union in this Re- ! pUbiic so long as that institution exists ' w,thin it; and whereas, slaves are now i used by the rebels as an essential means : of supporting and protecting uie war, j to we.k.o hi. pomn; tb.rtfor., i He it enactea uy me ocn.nc " -u- - j of Representatives, 'lhat tne i resiueni i : be requested to declare free, and direct .'.........I ..r.A nflinors in command to otter irccdoiu to an " leave their masters, oc shall aid in quelling the rebellion. ?

Mr. Wilson of Ma. called attention to a list of colored persons confined in prisons in Washinon, sent there by persons calling thenjeivea JU3. tioes of the Peace. The reort had been mde by Detective AHento the Provost Marshal. Mr. Wilsontrodueed a res- fplution for their riase. . bi lV-liSsiWraied-tfrer-pas: sage of the resolution. He remarked that we are now supporting the slaves of the rebels for them during the war. He thought this country the most corrupt, from the Supreme Court down, of any other in the world. The course of jus tice in this city was most extraordinary. He argued that it was the duty ot Con gress to look into the administration of justice in this District. Mr. Wilson remarked he had visited these poor persons in jail, and witnessed the things of which he had spoken, and the cruelcondition in which the inmates were placed. He indorsed the views expressed by Mr. Hale as to the administration of justice in this District. He was willing that his resolution should be referred to the Judiciary Committee. On motion of Mr. Clarke, it was Resolved, That the Marshal of the District of Columbia be requested to re port immediately to the Senate the names of all persons now confined in the jail in the City of Washington, with the causes of their commitment, the names of the magistrates by whom committed, the length of their imprisonment and the names of the persons who made the first arrest. Ou motion of Mr. Wilson, it was Resolved, That the laws now in force within the District of Columbia, relating to the arrest of fugitives from service or labor, together with all other laws con cerning persons of color in tho District of Columbia, be referred to the Commit tee on the District of Columbia, and that the Committee be further instructed to consider the expediency of abolishing I Slavery in the District, with compensa ! tion to the loyal owners of the slaves. I Mr. llutchins, of Ohio, introduced a joiut resolution concerning the rebel lion, the consideration of which was postponed; also, the following: Whereas, It has been represented that there are confined iu the Govern ment jail forty-five prisoners who are not charged sixth, erjujiV ',ut ar0 rj-ro-scnted as being slaves. Resolved, That the Committee for the District of Columbia be instructed to in quire into the truth of said report, and by what authority they are confined, who arc. the reputed owners, and what legislation if any is necessary to relieve them from impriso.ninetit, and to pre vent persons from being similarly ini prisoucd hereafter, and to report by bill or otherwise. Adopted. Mr. Dutin, of Indiana, offered a reso lution instructing the Committee on For lign Affairs to inquire into the practi cability and expediency of procuring the rights aud privileges of settlement and citizenship on any part of this continent, or ou the adjacent islands south of the United States, for the habitation of free persons of African descent, who may choose to emigrate thereto from the United States, for the formation of in dependent colonies, to be protected from foreign molestation. Adopted. Decembei5. In the House many resolutions were offered, but nothing of moment done. In the Senate Trumbull, of 111. intro duced a bill for the confiscation of the property of rebels and the. freeing of their slaves, and made one of the strongest speeches ever delivered in the chamber. We will try to find room for it hereafter. December 9. Many resolutions on many subjects introduced. Among the rest, and one which will cause the most fluttering was by Chandler, of Michigan, inquiring into the causes of our disastrous and dis graceful defeats at Manassas, Bulls Run, Balls Bluff, and other places. We hope the inquiry will be ordered. December 10. In the House, Pendleton, of Ohio, true to his instincts, made a motion for the liberation of some of the rebels now held as prisoners. He is desperately grieved that rebels should be imprisoned without a trial. He verv well knows that they cannot be tried except in the District where the offense wa3 com mitted, and that to try them there would be worse than a farce, as the courts have sworn allegiance to the rebel Government. In the Senate, the death of Senator Bingham, of Michigan, was announced, and, after the usual ceremonies the Sen ate adjourned. December II.

We went as far as Sedalia on the R. R., a distance of one hundred and eighty nine miles. ' From there we were or dered back. We would have had a march of one hundred and sixty miles before us besides the return. We were j much disappointed by the change of orders, as we were anxious to visit that portion of the State, the only portion we have not seen. Arriving at Sedalia, the present western terminus of the Pacific Rail Road, we ascertained that the ob ject of our movement was to guard the Pay-master and army chest, with the money destined to pay the troops of the army at Springfield. At first, from the secresy with which the movement was commenced, we supposed that we were to serve, asxaiij3cqrjorjaearer jpf dis patches to Gen. Hunter, and the com mander of the expedition knew no bet ter until we were aboard of the cars. We were absent only about fifty-two hours. I see by the papers that the removal of Gen. Fremont produces a great deal of excitement throughout the country, and as I am on the ground, and there fore may be presumed to know some thing of the merits of controversy which has led to his removal, you would like my opinion on the subject. The deep interest I feel in the success of the Union cause has led me to scrutinize with anxiety everything which effected our army, especially that portion of it in the western department. I very early came to the conclusion that Fremont was not the man for the place. His re fusal to re-enforce Gen. Lyon, whereby that gallant officer lost his life and our arms suffered a defeat, was only one of a series ot blunders which finally culmi nated in the capture of Mulligan at Lex ington, and caused him to be removed and Gen. Halleck to be appointed in his place. But if the appointment of Fre mont was an error, his removal at the precise time at which it was accomplished was a much greater one, and one which, I fear, will prove much more disastrous in its consequences. Already our army is in full retreat from Springfield, by orders from Gen. Hunter. Had Fre mont been continued in command, I have not the slightest doubt but the army would not only have maintained itself in that position, but would, before this time, have made another advance, thus driving Price entirely beyond the limits of the Slate. This, would have fiuished the war iu Missouri. The rebels would have no force in the State, except a small one under Jeff. Thompson, whieh is skulking in the swamps in the vicinity of Bloomfield, and is of do consequence Now I venture to predict that the war in the south-west will have to be fought over again. I he sou which dranc the blood of Lyons, will be enriched by the mouldering bones of many other true patriots to regain what the mistaken policy of the war department has volun tarily abandoned to the enemy. I said in the beginning that Fremont was not the man for the place to which he was appointed. He has not that kind of ability which is necessary to manage the affairs of an extensive military dis trict. He has the faculty of getting everything into confusion. Placed at the head of an army, with some one else to manage the details, he would be a for midable antagonist. As a strategist, I believe he is the equal of any general in the United States. But history fur nishes but few examples, where men have been endowed with the capacity to man age an army in the field, and to make an able commander of a military district. Gen. Washington is an example in point. Washington's ability to manage the af fairs of a military district, embracing the regions occupied by several separate ar mies, has rarely been equaled, and yet I do not hesitate to say, that a number of his subordinates would manage an army in the field to better advantage than he could. In nearly every action he fought in the open field, he was beaten Fremont s errors arose, 1 think, in part at least, from his anxiety to do ev erything himself, and thus .monopolize all the glory. With almost superhu man energy, he organized an army, of about forty thousand men, and instead of dispatching a column, as he clearly ought to have done, to the relief of Mul ligan, he delayed until he was ready to take the field himself. Then it was too late. Lexington had fallen, and its fall carried Fremont with it. He is down but I believe that a purer patriot does not live; and tl.at our western army is cursed with generals a dozen of whom, could they be concentrated into one, would yet be unequal to Fremont in ability or in patriotism. But I must close. My health is improving daily. We will leave here in about two weeks. Troops are pouring in here and at Cairo and Bird's Point. An immense army will soon' be assembled.

I heard no little archins hurrah ing for the "Union" the star-8Danrled banner waved only when we passed a camp of soldiers--and the "red, white and blue" was to be seen only in the faces of fhe ladies, the blue nredomina- ting to such an extent that the white and red were scarcely discernible. Mrs. Dinah, with her seventeen children, of all complexions, waa on hand, looking as sour as crabapphs, for they "dassent" smile on us Nigger-worshipers, Wooly- heads and Abolitionists. Taking the weaTBerand all into con sideration, I consider our reception rather cool. It is saddening to see such a state of affairs among the ladies, either white or black, but I don't think the general health was effected any more thereby than by tho cold. The gentle men, both white and of color, were not to be seen. The whites, probably, being with Buekner, and it is rather near the "north star" to ken "cullid cetnmen." if they do prefer slavery to freedom. That warm dinner that I didn't know but we would get, consisted of hard crackers, fat pork and coffee, about 7 o'clock in the evening. Our forces are gathering at Munfords- ville on Green river, and we are expect ing orders to move there any hour. The 33d Ohio is at Elizabethtown, and expected here in a short time. If we do not see a great battle in a few days, it is a clear case that I am not the son of a prophet. I don't know how many have gone forward, or are on their way, and dare not tell you if I did but it is "lots." ; To see our men practicing firing in the day time, and then to see so large a nuuber voluntarily turn out to "even ing prayers" at night, is convincing ar gument that the Eighteenth Regiment knows how to "trust in God and put their muskets to their shoulder," and you will, perhaps, hear what good fight ing they can do in a good and glorious cause, in a very short time.

SPENCE. Ingratitude- The rebels of Kentucky have held a convention and established a provisional Government. All the' proprieties re quired that they should have made Magoffin their Governor. But in the baseness of their ingratitude they passed him by, notwithstanding all the services he has rendered them. . r We extend, says the Louisville Dem ocrat, the hand of sympathy to Our genial Governor. He has been most basely betrayed by secessionists. After inclining to their views, and being cuddled up by them, it was shocking for them to' desert him; but to appoint another Governor atRussellville, was putting salt on the raw wound. "His suit they'd a right to reject, But why did they kick him dorn stairs?" 31 A BIUED, On the 12th December, at Uie residence of Jane Alexander, of Letart, by Rev. Carmi Al derman, Sir. Matthew D.
