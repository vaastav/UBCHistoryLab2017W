David Clark, a colored fire man, waa drowned, the remainder of the party were 6aved. The newspapers are agitating, some what, in the manner in which the cases of fraudulent income returns have been adjusted here, through the instrumentality of eome Federal ofik cers and the couri3. It appears that the revenue department was impress ed, that in some cases false income returns had been male here, and detailed J. T. LoekmaP, an "as sistant assessor, to correct them. Numerous oises were found, and for the purpose of adjusting them in a way to produce, the least agi tation, and at the eatue time, in the estimation of the authorities, make the largest sum for the Government, i under authority 'issued by the Com missioner ot internal lievenue, sucn persons were allowed to appear ia Court arter the adjustment of the pen alty by the Assessor of the First Di--triot, and confess judgment for the amount. This avoided publicity of trial, and saved costs oa the part of tho Government. Tha matter waa conducted by the District Attorney and his assistants, who claim that every opportunity waa offered the delinquents to proceed unaerstana- ingly and without prejudice to their rights. How many suon cases nave been adjusted during the Summer and Fall, an inspection of dockets alone will reveal, lhcy will proba bly reach fifty. It ia thought they ill aggregate vu.uuu, in wmcn tne Assistant Assessor baa tbe usual moity. Mr. Lockman is regarded by of ficials as one of the most reliable As sistant Aseessors in the service. So far but one attempt to open up the judgment has been made. This 00 curred this week. The statements of the Assistant Assessor and Assistant District Attorney, on the part of the Government, and tha complaint dis agreed. Judee Leavitt deelined to errant the motion to open the case Additional interest arises from the respectability of some of the parties who have sought triii method of set tlinif their differences with the Gov ernment.

FRANCE. ABOUT ORLEANS O Alt RETT A WfTISTLFS TO KEEP UP HIS COURAGE AKOTHft.i EN GAGEMENT PRUSSIAN DECKERS A SCAMPERING FROM TOURS. Tours, Dec. C. The offioial reports of the battles near Orleans, show that the Prussians attacked each Corps d'Armee separately, in greater force, thus repulsing the left army of tbe Loire, and turning Orleans, so as to render the evacuation of the town necessary. Gambetta has issued a circular to the Prefect, Baying that the situation of the army was good. Heavy reinforcements ot artillery are arriving, and a forward movement j will scon be resumed. , The opposition are attempting to circulate false reports to discourage and demoralize, but their assertions mav be be confidently denied. Yesterday the right wing of the ar my of the Loire had a successful en gagement with the Prussians near Montargis. The Prussian Prefects of the de partments occupied by the invaders have issued decrees that all msn between the ages of eight een and forty years will be considered prisoners of war, and that they will be shot if thry endeavor to escape. In spite of these decrees great numbers manage to escape to the French, lines, aided by the people, where they enlist in the French "nks. ... A great number of citizens have left Tours, fearing an attack by the Prussians. Most of the journals have also been removed to places of safety. The Government, however, has thus far evinced no intention of leaving. TUB AFFAIR AT P ATA Y THE GOVERNMENT WHISTLES STRENGTH OF THE ARMY OF THE LCI BE. j Special to the World. Tours, December 5. In tho en agement on the 31, at Patay, 20.000 "rench held their tronnd'against 60.- 000 of the troops of Frederick Charles, but were cut to pieces by the snens ot the enemy. The German artillery was served with fearful and over whelming effect. The Papal Zouaves fought with superhuman bravery, but nearly all were killed. The Government appeals to the people of France to still maintain re sistance, which 13 certain pnaiiy ia end in triumph. The Army ot the Loire is still over 200,000 strong. During another month 800,000 Frenchmen will be in arms. " Paris may fall. Tho campaign has changed ia character, and is fast becoming a dreaded warfare of armed maneuvering in open country. France herself is unconquerable. CAME, SAW, AND WERE C050.CSRED. Lille, December 5.

The market suffered a general decline, and ex hibited considerable weakness. The New York Central seemed to be tha Tiiiiuir.hi. point, and the stock: declined to and scrip to 81, which dragged down the en tire list. The decline in New York Cen tral is dne to tbe continued heavy sales by parties accredited with holding contiden tlal relations with Commotio.
