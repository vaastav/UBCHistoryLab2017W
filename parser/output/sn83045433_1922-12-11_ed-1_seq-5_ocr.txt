Reorgani ? zation and the Reclassifica tion Are Principal Measures With exclusive consideration of the appropriation measures in the Bouse, and night sessions talked af to fhre the Representatives a longer Christmas holiday, the ac tivity of District legislation for this week, it is believed, will center in the Senate committees. Republican Leader Mondell seld yesterday that he had bean ap proached by numerous Representa tives with the request that the Mouse hold night ???sions. While he had planned to allow only a two-day holiday, extending over Christmas and the day following, the demand for a longer period has been so general that night sessions msv be held. ALV. WANT HOLIDAY. The sentiment for s longer holi day is particularly strong on the Democratic ?ide of the House, he eald. Representative Garrett, of Tennessee, broached the subject Just before adjournment Saturday after noon. He said many members be lieve night sessions conducive to ac curate and expeditious consideration of appropriations legislation. "The experience of this body has been that it works better under pressure." he declared Republican members also made the point that heretofore when a abort Christmas holiday has been granted, the House has never had a quorum immediately af?^r the holiday. Mondell said that he would de eld* the question this week after talking with some of the other leaders. BUM LINE SEEKS CHARTER. Chairman Bell, of the Senate Dis trict Committee, said yesterday that a meeting would be held Wednesday to take up District legislation. Con sideration will be given to the ap plication of the bus lines for a charter.

At presen' the bus lines operating f? 1 ipon permit granted by tb?? District Commissioners. In vm-v of li?? far that this is a temporary arrange ment. and the permits are subj*H-t to revocation on twenty four hour?* notice, the committee considers it Important to decide upon a definite program. Hearings on the advisability of granting a charter ui!l not bo granted until after thr ion has b* ?n discussed Wedne* 'av. Chair man Hall said. He is .?f rlie opin ion that a charter will be i.';>?ued. but it is particularly to the extent of the charter that the committee w '.1 devote Its attention. AWAITS EXPERT ADVICE. "Unless the Capper ri-organiz* tion porgram comes up. the next li"r?ortant thing in District matters will be watching appropriations." -aid Senator Capper, however, said yesterday that he is making every effort to whip the reorganization Pvoeraw into shape. Practically everything bas been decided and s tentative bill has been drafted.
