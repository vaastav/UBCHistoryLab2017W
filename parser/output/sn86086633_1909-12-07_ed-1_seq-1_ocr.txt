The American rights (In the fisher ies on the North Atlantic const) un der the fisheries article of the treaty of 1818 have been a cause of difference between the- United States and Omit Britain for nearly seventy years.. The nr of treat lm- lmerenia - . portance to the Amerlcnn fishing in dustry, and the final settlement of the controversy (by the permanent court of arbitration at The Hague will re move a source of constant rltntlon and complaint. This Is the l.rst case involving such great International questions which has been submitted to tho permanent court of arbitration at The Hague. Negotiations for an International conference to consider and reach an arrangement providing for the preser vation and protection of the fur seals In the north Pacific are In progress i.ih the o-rtvernments of Great Bri tain, Japan and Russia.

COOK RECORDS REACH EUROPE Are Delivered Today to Scientists . of the University of Copenhagen. SCRUTINIZE THEM CAREFULLY Documents Are Very Lengthy and it Is Not Likely That Board Will An nounee Decision on Claim Un . til Early in New Year. Copenhagen, Dec. 7. With the ar rival today of the North Pole records of Dr. Frederick A. Cook, no time will be loBt by the University of Copen hagen scientists in deciding his claims. The committee for the consideration of the records has been organized, with Prof. Ells Stromgren, director of the Astronomical Observatory, as the chairman. Walter Lonsdale, secretary to Dr. Cook, was custodian of the records on the trip across the Atlan tic, and looked after them as carefully as If they had been Jewels of untold value. . Dr. Cook's report, as has been de clared, s a voluminous document con taining some 30,000 words. Mr. Lons dale said that the documents are In complete form and ready for the scientific scrutiny. The report and the records were under lock and key In the strong room of the steamer while she was at sea. The secretary expects that the Copenhagen univer sity .authorities will make public their opinion of the records by the first of the new year. There have been rumors In circula tion that the Cook records are not In possession of Mr. Lonsdale, and ' that they were sent on another steamer, because of an alleged plot hatched by Cook's enemies to secure and destroy them. No credence Is placed In this report, and it Is generall believed here that the records are in the hands of Dr. Cook'a secretary. Mt. McKinlty Proofs Toe. New York, Dec. 7. According to Dr. Cook's counsel, the records sent to Copenhagen with 30.000 words of ex planatory. comment comprise only the data of the trip to the pole. Tne rec ords of the trip back were left with the instruments 'In care of Harry Whitney at Etah. To this was added the Information that in addition to the records and ex planatory matter Dr. Cook sent to Co penhagen fifteen more affidavits about the Mount McKlnley climb. Agents of the explorer obtained these affidavits last October In Montana. One of them Is from a resident of Tacoma, who swore that Barrlll, the guide, offered on Oct 1 to make affidavit that he and Dr. Cook had been to the top of Mount McKlnley. Two days after this Bar rill made his affidavit stating that Cook did not climb to the top of Mc Klnley. There la another affidavit found. A lawyer of Tacoma stated that a bank clerk of that city told him that Barrill had spoken of getting $1,500 to make the affidavit against Cook. This bank clerk, when approached by Cook's agents, refused to make such an affi davit. Other affidavits that Dr. Cook has sent to the Copenhagen savants are from old neighbors of Barrlll's In Darby, Mont, who say that Barrlll often told them that he and Cook had scaled Mount McKlnley. Dr. Cook was not asked by the Dan ish scientists to send any proof of the Mount McKlnley climb. It was ex plained by his legal representative that he was so deeply concerned over the attacks on his veracity that he had decided to ship the batch of affidavits anyway.

Figures Largely in City Elections Throughout Massachusetts Today. Boston, Mass., Dec. 7. Keen Inter est has been aroused in the city elec tions In Massachusetts today by the active campaign of the prohibition forces of the State to make as many cities "dry" as possible. Fourteen of the leading cities of the State vote on the liquor issue today, and a week hence nearly all of the remaining cit ies of the State will vote on the ques tion. In anticipation of the city elections a spirited contest has been waged all over Massachusetts between the forces of prohibition and those who believe in the regulated saloon. The struggle be- ween the opposing forces Is, on the ne hand, to Increase the number f "dry places," on the other, to re uce It. This, however. Is, in a mea sure, only Incidental to the main pur pose, so far as the temperance work ers are concerned, for they desire, In addition to drawing the prohibition line closer about the saloons, to swell the otal vote of the State In favor of prohibition. This Is In their favor already by a majority of nearly 20.000, tnd a large no-license vote at the reent elections willadd to this con siderably. This Is desired by the pro hibitionists for the moral effect It may have on the State legislature when the constitutional amendment, providing for the resubmission of the question of prohibition to the voters, gets on th legislative calendar next winter. Not all the work has been done by the prohibitionists, however, since the advocates of license In many of tha no-llcense cities have been making un usual efforts to swing the pendulum the other way In the present elections. This Is particularly true In New Bed ford, Fall River, Worcester and Lynn, and to a degree In all the other cltlea which went dry a year ago. In Wor cester the fight has been waged for months, while In Fall River and New Bedford it began almost as soon aa the votes were counted last December. Both of the latter swung Into the no license column at that time, while Worcester Is now completing Its sec ond year of prohibition, as Is also Lynn. Adolph Hermann has returned from Copper Harbor, where he has been J spending the past two weeks.
