Reiter Issues Injunction and Which is J Served on Councilmen j When They Appear for! Business. . ! The city of Hammond borrowed its own money from city banks today and ' paid C per cent interest for it. An injunction served last night from Judgo Virgil S. Reiter's superior court, signed by City Treasurer-elect Walter F. Bielegeld, on Mayor John D. Smalb-y and the members of the city council pro hibited that body from passing an or dinance providing for the transfer of 123.000 from tho water fund to tho gen eral fund to pay the salaries of the city employes and special assessments due. In order to lake care of the expenses an ordinance was drawn sanctioning the borrowing of '$30,000 at 6 per cent in terest. This was passed unanimously with Councilman Reilley voting affirm ative lj". In other words, through Reilley's actionlast Friday night in bucking the ordinance transferring the money from one fund to the other which has been done almost every year to tide over the extra budgett of expenses the close of every annum brings, will cost the city of Hammond almost $1,000 for interest, whereas if the money had been borrow ed from tho water fund this money would have been saved, according to city hall officials. The transfer ordinance authorized the money borrowed to be re turned to the water fund. May, 1318, af ter the annual itV3h&xe. .were - col lected. The reason the general fund was short this year was explained as follows by one of the officials: ' "We are short almost every year at this time because of unexpected ex penses. This year we arc short $5,073. 20 in liquor licenses; an increase of po lice salaries cut it down $2,327.60; fire department wage raises, $2,52?; board of public works expenses, $3S0; Calumet avenue sewer along city park which city must pay, $7, 404. "S and State street sewer in front of Federal building which comes out of tho city funds, $11S9.C5, and the cost of election. $4,164.87. These Amounts total $2S.S27,S0. "In borrowing from the bariks $30,000 we are paying 6 per cent interest on our own money, there being $40,000 in water funds deposited drawing 2 per cent in terest. If we had transferred the money from the water fund to the general fund it would have saved the. city almost $1, 000 which it must pay now as interest on tho money borrowed." Higher cost of materials and the ne cissfty of increasing the wages of the employes on account of living expenses was also given as one of the reasons for the general fund delinquency. As the mayor and councilmen filed into the council chambers Deputy Sheriff Albert L. Morris served the restraining orders. It wrjj the first time in the history of tho city that a court was called upon to prohibit the city council in the performance of any of its duties. -S&rrey Accepted.

American ships may aid the Italian naval forces against the Austrian fleet through for military reasons no definite statement is given. The chief effects of the declaration will be to make tho Austrians in this country susceptible to registration, roundup and Internment. Of the fifty members who voted no on the war declaration against Germany only a handful are expected to oppose tho Aus trian resolution, a poll revealed today. Shackleford. Missouri, and other erst while pacifists, were solidly aligned for war to the hilt. The senate pacifists probably will muster only two votes, La follette and Gronna, against the decla ration. Neither would say outright that they intended to vote against the reso lution.
