We print herewith tha first annual liea-k--se of Abraham Lincoln, and at such a lime ai this we Jo not need to Invite for It the careful attention of every citiinn. It will be read with Interest, not only through out our own country, but throughout .the world, and Its recommendations will be dijonswJ as fre! in European Capital! and CablneU as they will be in every school district in loTal America. Never before WW there more interest fc-lt U Iti provisions. Every hnaUct, and almost every family haf a reprueunUtire In the grand army, and a per sonal welfare In the Ustie of the war. President Lincoln gives no lengthy prelude or preliminary flourish ot rhetoric. He at once takes hold of the rebellion, and directs his first attention to the fears of foreign In tcrference. The ribels have roctived less foreign aid than they hud expected, for for eign powers do not tail to see that the furth rtnoe ot their trade and commerce can beet be accomplished with the one united nation i has vuh its divided parts. But the safety cf this country, the President well remarks, rent more upon the loyally, patriotism, vir tue and independence of the American peo ple than upon foreign aid. Nevertheless, be recommends putting ourselves in a state oi defence so far as we can readily do so, espec ially upon our lakes and rivers. Fortifica tions and depots at well selected poiuto would be of importance. It is recemmendtd as a military measure that Congress construct a railread to connect Eastern Tennessee and Western North Caro lioa with Kentucky. This looks, doubtlesti not only to future usefulness, but to war operations in Eastern Kentucky and the for mer States. In cae of the advance of the two armies, one from Kentucky and the other from Charleston and BavBnhahovrards each other, such a road would be of in.mense ad vantage, while at all times it woild be means of commerce and profit to the loyal Tenaesseeans. Mr. Lincoln recommends that United States vessels be empowered not only to de fend themselves against pirates but also to recapture prizes, which have been taken by pirates or privateeis. The remarks of the President upon re cognizing the independence of Hayti and Liberia, ar extremely woll timed.. Those nations have shown the ability of the color ed race to take care of and elevate themselves and we should not be content, in these days of the slaveholders' rebellion, to be the last uovernmem uj recugai-t-o men c-hdm;. JL mgu compliment lb paiu j of the Treasury for the able manner in which be has conducted the affairs of his depart ment, and confidence is expressed in the dis position of the people to stand by the Gov ernment. - The number of men who have volunteered for the war is greater than the number au thorized by Congress lo be called out; and till the patriotism of the people is unabated. With some recommendations regarding Chaplains in Hospitals, the President refeis the public to the report of the Becretarr ol War. So treat have been the additions to the Navy that it may be eaid a new Xavy has been created which has honored itself and the country. -There are three vacancies In the Supreme Court, caused by the death of Judge Daniel ne lfcLeanjinil ih Tairn1nn of President makes some suggestions as to the Judiciary system of the country, It U recommended that the Statutes of tha United States be revised, condensed and put Into convenient form for general use. Attention is given to the claims of loyal citizens upon rebels, which they are unable to collect through existing laws and the hope expressed that Congress may divise some plan by which justice may be administered in all those parts of the rebel States which by any manner come under the power of our arms. It Is recommended that the District of Co lumbia, by negotiation with Virginia, be en larged to Its former boundaries of ten miles square. Indian affairs are considered generally fa vorable, and in a few words the President give bird's eye view of the operations of the Postal and Interior Departments. Coming then, to the rebellion, its connec tion with slavery and the means employed to put it down, Mr. Lincoln says that in the policy adopted toward the insurgents he has confined himself, so far as possible, to the enactments of Congress, not having trans cended them. He has made the restoration of the Dnion the primary work to be attend ed to, leaving many minor matters to be de bated by the national legislature. What to do with the negroes, is of course a great ques tion connected with the war. Air. Lincoiii declares in favor of colonizing them in some congenial climate. He advocates no general emancipation, but his language clearly im plies that he considers all eltve belonging to rebel masters, who are in any way employed to aid the rebellion, as liable to contujcation. Of these and of those who have escaped to our lines, we have now a great number so many that something must be done with them. ' It it recommended that sufficient territory be ac quired on which to colonize these, as also free colored persons. " Having practiced the ac quUitloa of territory for fifty years, it is too late to discuss its constitutionality " He considers that this is a case of absolute ne cessity, if we would perpetuate our govern ment. ' The despotism of the rebel argnments that 'capital should own labor," is strongly shown by Mr. Lincoln. " . This portion ot the Message was written aftsr the publication of the report of the Constitutional Committee of the Richmond' Convention, noticed by us a few days since, and effectually uses np their flimsy argu ments. - ' With a brief summing np of the progress of our cation from its birth to the preeent time, and with hopes and confidence for the fu tare, the President close his Message, which, as a practical business paper, as well as pa triotic discourse, has never beeu excelled by any former occupant of the Presidential chair. - A Big Thing on Wood. Wood New, Terk has redeemed herself. is laid out, and Opdyke elected Mayor. 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow dtiietu of the Striata ani JJor.ir of BtjtrtttnUiUtH . . In the midst of unprecedented political troubles we have cause of great gratitude lo God for unusual (rood beHltfland must aounu ant harvests. You will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar essences or the time but intoroouine . with foreign nation has been attended with protounil solicituuo, Chiefly turning upon our own domestic at fairs, w . . to of THE 

REBELLION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE A disloyal portion of the American peo ple bava, during tbe w note year, boenengiig el in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A aUoa - which endure tactions domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, or both, is sura, soon er or later, to invoke foreiun iutervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not at- wavs able to resist the counsels ot seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, al though measures adopted under such influ ences seldom fail to be unfurl uuai and lnju- iruus to those adoption them. The dtaloval oitinns of tne united estate who have offered thr ruin of our country In reward for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received l patronasr and encouragetmnt than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations in this case, disregnraing all moral, social and treaty obligations.wonld act solely and aelfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including spec ially, the acquisition of cotton, these nations ariDear as yet not to nave eeeu their way to their object mora uirecuy or clearlv wrouun tne aesiruciion tiu throutrh the preservation of the union. we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle tian this I am ouite sure a second argument cor Id ne made to show that they could reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding crush this rebellion than by giving encour agement to the principal lever relied on by it. : The excltinir ot foreign nations to hos tility against na, as already Intimated. is tha embarrassment of commerce. These nations, however, not improbably caw from the first that it was the Union which made as well onr foreign as ou- domesti. commerce. They can scarcely fill to per ceive that the effort for disunion produces the eiistiuor difficulty, and that one strong na tion promises more darable peace, a',d a more extensive, valuable and reliablo comncrce than the same nation broken into hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign Sitates, because whatever mieht be their wishes, or cisposi lions, the integrity of our couutry rod the stability of our Government mainly depends not upon them, but upon tne loyauj, patriot ism, virtue and intelligence ot the American people. The correspondence itself, vith the ususal reservation, is berewitusu emitted, venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality tcwarcs .or eiim t powers averting . causes cf - irri tation, and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, hewerer, it is aDDarent that here, as in every othar State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic diffbulties, i recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for rnaintnining the public defences on every siae; wui.e uu der this treuerai recommendation provision for defendiud our coast line readily occcr to the mind. OUR DEFENCES. I also, in the same connection,asvths r.ttan tion of C'onereas to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and de pots of arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, at we'd selected points upon these, would be of great import ance to the national defense and pressrvatlon. I ask attention to the views of the Secretary bf War, expressed in his report rpen the tome eeneral subject. I deem it of import ance that the loyal regions of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina should ce con nected- with Kentucky and other faithful narts of tbe Union by railroad.. 1 therefore recommend as a military measure, that Con imys Drovide for the construction of such road as soeedilv as possible. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, and through her Legis lature make the most judicious selection of the line. The northern terminus must con nect with some existing railroad, and whether the route shall be from Lexington or mcno laeville to Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line, in the direction ot easily be' determined. Kentucky and the General Government co-operating, the vrork can be completed in a very short time, and when done, it will be not onlj of vast preeent usefulness, but also an available psrmanent Improvement, worth its cost in all the future. FOREIGN TREATIES. ' Some treaties designed chiefiy for the in terests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated, and will be suhmitted to the Senate lor their consideration. Although we bf.ve failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration for the rigor of maritime war, we have far removed all tbe obstacle from the way of their humane reform, except such as an merely of tempo rary and accidental occurrence. invite your attention to the correspondence be tween her Britanic Uajosty's Minister, ac credited to this Government, ai:d the Sec retary of State, relative to the detention of the British ship Perthshire, in June last, by the United States steamer Massachusetts, (or a supposed breach of the blocde. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misrepresentation of the facts, end as jus tice requires that we should corimit no bel ligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recommend than an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owneri of the ves sel for her detention. THE CHINA CLATMS. 1 repeat the recommendation c-irry prede cessor, in bis anuuul message :c Congress, in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of Americen citi zens againet China, pursuant to tha ewards of the Commissioners, under tbe at of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, !l should not be deemed advisable to carry the., recom mendation into effect, I would trtgcst that authority be given tor investing the princi pal, over tbe surplus referred to, a good se curities, with a view to the satisfaction ot such other j net claim of oar citirens against China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our eiteusive tn-.de with tbat Empire. By the act of the 3th of Augns' last, Con gress authorized the President to instr'ct the commanders .'of suitable vesiseis to defend themselves against, and to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised ir. a single instance only. . ... For the more ellectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce in the Eas tern seas, especially, it seems to ms that it would also be ad visible to authorize the com mander of (Ailing vessels "to recapture any prizes which pirates my make cf United State veese!s,autheir cargoes, and tbe Con sular Court established by law in Eastern Countries to adjudica'e the cases in the event thatftmi should not be objected to tv the lo cal authorities. TBI iaOEPEKDXVCI Of 

BAYTI AMQ LISIB! A. : If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding cur recogni tion of the Independence and sov?reignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am anable to discern It. Unwilling, however, to inaugnrats a novel policy In regard to tUom without th appro bation of Congress, I submit for your consid eration the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a Charge d'Affaires rear each of these States. It doe not admit of doubt that important commercial ad vautres might be secured 'by favorable treali-i with them. THE TREASURY. Tbe operations of tbe Treasury during tbe period which has elapsed since you adjourn ment, have been conducted with signal sue oees. ' Tbe patriotism of the people ha placed at the disposal of th Goverarseat the B means demanded l.y the public exigen Much of the National Loan has bees taken by citizens of the Industrial classes, hose confidence In their counlrv's faith and seal for their country's deliverance from ita present peril, have induced them to contnuuie tbe support or the Ouvernment the wuoie their limited acnuisilious. This fact im pose peculiar obligation to economy in aiv bureement aud euergy in actiou. The revenue from all source, including lii&ni fnr the financial ver ending on the 30th of June, 1861, was $86,635,900 27, and the expenditure for the same period, tnclua mvmcnts on account of the public debt, were SM.DiO.u.i a leaving a Daiamn m . . . - ., i the Treasury on the lt of July, of $2,257,- 0t:r 80 for the first quarter ot the nnanciat vmr endini tbe 30th of Sept.. 1H01. The receipts rrom an sonrcee, including tun balance from July 1st, were $102,632,501) 27, and ths expenses, $98,239,733 09 ; leaving a balance on 1st Cut., met, or $4,zuz,T(i io. Estimates tor the remaining three quarters ol tho year and for the financial year of 1863, together with bis view of the way and meins for meeting the demands contempla ted by them, will be submitted to Congress br the Becretary ol ire Treasury. It ia gratifying to know that the expenses made necescarv bv the rebellion are not be yond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe mat me same pairiousm wu u has thus far sustained the Government will continue to sustain it until peace and union shall again bless the land. THE 

ARMY. I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information respecting the numerical strength ot 'he army, ana lor recommendations having In view an increase of it efficiency, and tbe well being of the various branches ot the service eu trusted to his care. Ill gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people ia equal to the oc casion, and that the number ot troops ten dered greatly exceeds the force which Con cress authorized me to call Into the field. 1 refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the credit able degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition of the entire army. The recommendation by the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis, ia a subject of vital Importance to the future safety ot the country, and is comm -na to tbe. serious attention ot Congress. A large addition to the regular army, in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of it officers, civee peculiar importance to bis rec ommendation tor increasing the corps of ca det to the greatest capacity of the Military Academv. By mere omission, I presume, Congress ha failed to provide Chaplains for the Hospitals occupied by volunteers. Thi ubjeet was brought to my notice, and I was induced to draw np the form of a letter, one copy of which properly addressed to each of the per sons and at the dates respectively namea, ana stated in a schudale containing also the form of the letter marked "A," and herewith trans mitted: These gentlamen I tinderstandjenter ed upon tbe duties designated at the time res pectively stated in the schedule, and have la bored faithfully therein ever since. I there fore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate a Chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general provisions be made for chaplains to serve at hospital as well as with regiments. THE ARMY. THE NAVY. ftThe report of the Secretary of tbe Navr presents in detail the oper ations ot that branch of the service, and the activity and energy which have charac terized ita administration and the results ot measures to increase lis efficiency and pow er. Such have been the additions by con struction and purchase that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service since our difficulties commenced. Betides blockading onr extensive coast, souadrons lareer than ever before assembled under our flag have been put afloat and per formed deeds which have increased our navai renown. - I would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy for a more perfect organisation of the navy by introducing additional grades in the service. The present organization Is defec tive and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions submitted br the Department will, it is be lieved, if adopted, obviate the difficulties allnded to, promote harmony and Increase th efficiency of the navy. THE [...]. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court Two by the decease of Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have so far loreborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons whioh I will now state. Two of the outgoing Judges resided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if successors were appointed In tbe same localities they could not serve upon their circuits, and many ot the most competent men there probably would not take tbe per sonal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the supreme bench. I have been unwilling to throw all tbe appointment northward, thus disabling my self from doing justice to tbe South on tbe return of peace, although I may remark that to transfer to the North one which has here tofore been in the South, would not, with ref erence to territory and population, be unjust. During the long and brilliant judicial career of Suuge Mclveau, 013 circuit grew into an an empire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the courts therein more thsu a nominal attendance, rising in population lrom 1,470,000 in 1831, to C,15l,405 in 1860. Besides this, tbe conntry has generally out grown our present Judicial system. If uni formity was at all intended, the system re quires that all the States shall be accommo dated with Circuit Court, attended by Su preme Judges, while in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon, hare never had any such courts, nor can this be well remedied without a change of the sys tem, because tbe adding ot justices to tbe su preme Court, enough for the accommodation ot all parts of the country witbCircuitOourts, would create a court altogether too danger ous for a judicial body ot any ixt, and the evil of it be one that will increase as new States come into tbe Union. Circuit Courts are useful or they are eat useful. If useful, no State should be denied them. If not use ful, no State should have them. Let them be provided for all, or abolished as to all. Three modifications occur to VPJ) here, which I think would be an improvement up on our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number io every event. Then first let tbe whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, tha Supreme Judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number, and independent Circuit Judge be provided for all the rest; or secondly, tbe Supreme Judges he relieved from Circuit duties, and Circuit Judge provided for ell thp Cirpajtfj or thirdly, dispense with Circuit Court alto gether, leaving the judifjaj functions wholly to the Distriet Courts, and an independent Supreme Court. THE U. S. 

STATUTES. I respectfully reocommend to the consider ation of Congress, the present condition of the statute laws, with tbe hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for the many inconveniences aud evils which con stantly embarrass those engaged in the prac tical administration of tbem. bince the organization of the Government Congress ha enacted some S00O acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than 6000 closely printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without suffi cient caution, so that their provisions are of ten obscure in themscive or in conflict with each 'other, or at least so doubtful a jo render it very difficult for even the best informed persons to ascertain pre cisely what th statute law is. It seems lo ma very important that the statute law should be made as plain and In telligible as possible, and be reduced to a small a compass as may consist with the full- ness and precision of tie will of ths legisla- ture and the porapioultv of ita language. These well done would, I think, greatly fa cilitate the labors of those whose duty it l to assist in tbe administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to th people by placing before them Id a more accessible and Intelligible form tbe laws which so deeply concern their Intercuts and their dutle. I am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all the act of Congress now In force and of a permanent, general nature, might be revised and re-written o as to be embraced in on volume, or at least two vol umes of ordinary and convenient size ; and 1 respecUully recommend to Congress to con sider th subject, and If my iuggestlon be ap proved, to devise such a plan a to their wis dom shall seem most proper for th attain ment of the esd proposed. . , 

NORTHERN CLAIMS IN REBEL STATES. One of the unfavorable consequences ot the present insurrection is the entire suppression In many places ot all ordinary means of ad- minlsteriug civil justice by the olficers,aad ia the forms ot existing law. This is the case in whole or In part in all the Insurgent States, and as our armies advance upon and take possession of part of those States, tbe prac tical evil become more apparent. There are no courts or officer to whom the citizen ot other State may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claim against citizen ot the Insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claim, some have estimated it as high as 200,000,000 dollars, due in large part from insurgents in open re bell ion to loyal citizen, who are even now making great sacrifice In tbe discharge of their patriotic duty to support the Govern ment. Under these circumstances I have been urgently solicited to establish, by mili tary power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus far de clined to do It, not because i bad any Ooudi that the end proposed, tbe collection ot debt was just and right in itself, but because have been unwilling to go beyond the pres sure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power. But .he powers of Congress, I sup pose, are equal to the anomalous oc casion; and therefore, I refer tbe whole matter to Congress, with tbe hope that a plan may be devised for the admmisvation of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and territories as may be nnder con trol of this Government whether by a vol nntary return to allegiance and order or by tbe power of our arms, ibis, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a tem porary sabstitute, and to cease a coon as the ordinary courts can be reestablished in peace. 

CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT. It is important that some more convent. ent means should be provided if possible for the adj ustment of claims against tha Uovern ment, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the dutv ot the Government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citi zens as it is to administer tbe same between private individuals. The in vestigation and adjudication of all the claims In their nature belong to the Judicial department ; besides it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions. It was in. tended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of bust nes from the hall of Congress ; but while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in a great degree tails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments u- naL Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether thia power of making judgment final may not be properly given to the Court, reserving the right of ap peal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as expen ance may have shown lo be necessary, THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT. I ask attention to the report of the Post, master General, the following being a sum mary statement of the condition of the De partment Tbe revenue from ail sources during tbe fiscal year ending 30th Jane, 1861, including- the annual permanent appropria tion of $700,000 for the transportation of free mail matter was $9,049,296.40, being about two per cent, less than the reve nue ot 1860. The expenditures were $13,' 606,709.11, showing a decrease ot more than 8 per cent as compared with those of the previous year, and leaving an excess of ex penditures over the revenue for th last fucal year of over $557,462 71. The gross reve nue for the year ending June 30th, 1863, Is that of 1861, making - $8,683,000: to which should be added the earning of tbe Depart ment for carrying free matter, vis: $700,000, making $9,382,000.. The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leav Ing an estimated deficiency of $3,334,000 to be supplied from th Treasury, it addition to the permanent appropriation. THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this district across the Potomac river at the time of establishing the capital here, was eminently wise, and conse quently, tuat the relinquishment of that por tion of it which lies in tbe Sta'e ot Virginia, was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency of regain ing that part of the district and the restora tion of the original boundaries thereof through negotiation with the State or Virginia. THE 

INTERIOR. The report of the Secretary of the Interi or, with tbe accompanying documents, exhib it tbe condition or tbe several branches of the public business pertaining to that De partment Tbe depressing influence of tbe insurrection have been especially telt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Office. Tbe caeh receipts from the sales of publio lands during the past year have ex ceeded the expense of our land system only about two thousand dollars. The sales have been entirely suspended In the South ern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country, and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have obstructed settlements la the new States and Territories of the North west. Tbe receipts of the Patent Office have de olined In nine months, about 100,000 dollars, rendering a large reduction ot the lorce em ployed necessary to make it self sustaining. The demand npou the Pension Office will be hugely increased by the insurrection. Na- marous applications for pensions based upon tbe casualltles ot the existing war, have al ready been made. There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the Pension Boll and la receipt pt the bounty of tbe Government are in toe ranks of the insurgent army or giving them aid and som? fort The Seeretary of the Interior has directed the suspension ef ths payment of the pension of such persons, upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend tbat Congress au thorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension tolls. INDIAN AFFAIRS. The relations of the Government vitb the Indian tribes have been lately disturbed by tbe Insurrection, especially in tee northern su perin tendency, and in that of slew Mexico. Tie Indian conntry south of Kansas is in possession of insurgents from Texas and Ar. k an sag. The agents of the United States, ap pointed since the UU or March lor this gu perintendency, have been nsabio to reach their poets, while the most of tbost who were in office before that time have espoused the insurraotions-y cause, and assumed to exercise the powers ot agents by virtue of commissions from the insurrectionists. It has been stated In the public press that a por tion of these Indian bare been organized as a military force and are attached to tho army ot tbe insurgents, although the Government has no official Information upon the subject Letters have been written to the Commis sioner of Indian affairs by several promipeot chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States, and expressing the wish for the presence of tbe Federal trosps to pro tect tbem. It Is believed tbat on the re-pos-sessisn of the country by the Federal forces, ths Indians will readily cease all hostile de monstrations and resume their former rela tions to th Government AGRICULTURE. Agriculture, confessedly ths largest Inter est ot the nation, ha not a department or a bureau, but a clerkship only aaalgned to It lit Government While it is fortunate that this great Interest Is so Independent la it naturo a not to hav demanded and extorted more from th Government, I respectfully aek Congress to considr whether something more cannot U given voluntarily with gen eral advantage. Annual reports exhibltins: the condition of our agriculture, commerce and manufacture would present a fond of information of great practical value to th country. While I make no suggestion , as to - details, I - venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau mltrtit probably be or- ganteed.- - . THE 

SLAVE TRADE. The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade has been confined to tbe Department of the In terior. It U a subject ot congratulation that th efforts which have been made for ths suppression of this inhuman traffic have re cently been attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the Slav trade have been seized and condemned: two master engaged in th trade, and on per son equipping th vessel as a slaver ha been convicted and subjected to tho penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain taking np a cargo of Africans on board bis vessel has been convicted of ths highest grade of offence nnder our laws, th punish ment oi Which is death. THE TERRITORIES. Th Territories of Colorado, Dakotah and Nevada, created by tbe last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein nnder auspices specially gratifying, when- it is considered that ths leaven of treason was found existing In some of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there. T he abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded by or ganized Government, will doubtless invite to them a large Immigration when peace shall restore tbe business of the conntry to Its ac customed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evinced the patriotic spirit of th people of the territory. So far the authority of the United Slates has been upheld in all the ter ritories, as it la hoped It will be in the future, I commend their interests and defence to th onlightanedand generous care of Congress. THE DISTRICT. I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress th interest of the District of Colombia. Tho indirection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to the Inhabitants, and as they hav no representa tive in Congress, that body should not over look their just claims upon tbe Government THE WORLD'S FAIR. At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorising ths President to take measures for facilitating a proper representa tion, of the industrial interests of the United States at the exhibition of the Indus try of all nations, to be holden at London la the year 1862. .1 regret to have been finable to give personal attention to this subject, subject at once so interesting in itself, and so extensively and intricately connected with tbe tnater'al prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of the State and In terlor a plan or system has been devised and partly matured which will be laid before you. THE 

CONTRABAND QUESTION. Under and by virtue of the act of Congress, entitled an act to confiscate property used for Insurrectionary purpose, approved Aujr. 6tb, 1861, legal claim of certi in persons to the labor and service of certain other per. sons have become forfeited, and numbers of tbe latter thus liberated are already depend ant on the United States, and most be provided for in some way besides this. It is not impossible that some . of tha States will pass similar enactments for their own benefit respectively, and by the operations which persons of tbe same class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case I recommend tbat Congress pro vide for accepting such persons from such Stales, according to same mode of valuatior, in lieu pro Umlo of direct taxes, or upon soma other plan to be agreed upon with inch State respectively; that loch persons on inch acceptance by th Gen eral Government, be at onos deemed i free, and that in any event, steps be taken for colonizing both olasse. or UwmiMt tiooed if the other shall not be brought into existence, at some plaee or places in a climate congenial to them. It mlgnt be well to con sider, too, whether the tree colored people already In the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be Included in such colonization. To carry out the plan of colonising may involve th acquiring of territory, and also the appropnatioi of money bsyond that to be expended in tbe T erritiral aqulsition. Having practiced the acquisition of Territory for nearly fifty years, the question of Constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The power was hrst questioned by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, In the purchase of Louisiana yielded his scruples on the plea of great ex pediency. It has been said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish homes for white men. This measure effects that object for the emigration ot colored men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefl'er mea leav.S additional room for white son, however, placed tbe importance of pro curing JUouisiana more on political and com mercial grounds than on providing room for population. On thi whole proposition, in cluding the appropriation of money with tha acquisition of territory, dees not the expe diency amount to absolute necessity that without which tbe Government cannot be perpetual. SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION. In considering tha policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection, I hav bean anxious and careful that the inevitable con flict for this purpose shall not degenerate in to a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have therefore, in every case. thought it proper to keep ths Integrity of ths l nion prominent as tne primary object or thi contest on onr part, leaving all questions which ar not or vital military importance to the moredeliberato action of th legislature. In tbe exercise of my best discretion. I have adhered to the blockade of the port held oy luc insurgents, losieuu or pniung ;n lore by proclamation, the law or Congress enacted at the late session, lor closing thos ports, alw obeying the dictates of prudence as well as tne ooiigauons oi law. Instead of transcending I hav adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon th same subject should be pro posed, its propriety will be duly considered. Tbe Union must be preserved, and hence all dispensable means most be employed. we should not na la haste to determine what radical and extreme measures which may reach the3oyal as wejl as tha disloyal, are In dispensable. The Inaugural address at ths beeinains? of 10 aoauoisirauon, ana ue Message to Con gress at die Ute special session, Var both mainly aevotea to tne domestic controversv. out of which the insurrection and consequent war nav sprung, nothing now occurs to add or subtract to cr from th principle on genera) purposes stated and expressed ia uiose aocumep:. SUPPRESSION OF THE REBELLION. A REVIEW. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union jeaceabiy expired at tha assault apqa Fort Sasstor, and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was painfully uncertain then, I much better deined and hiore dfstjnat now, o4 the progress ot events is plainly in ths right direction. - Th Insurgents confidently claim ed a strong support from north of Masoa 4 Dixon's line, and tha friend of th Union were not free from apprehension on this point This, however, was soon settled defi nitely and on the right side. South of the Lisa noble little Delaware led off right from the first . Maryland was mad to Mem against tha Union. Our soldier were as saulted, bridges wer burned and Railroad I torn tip within bar limits, and ws wen ta&ay j day at on tim without th ability to bring a single Regiment over the soli to th Capi tal, flow her bridges aud Railroads are re paired and opened to' the Govern ment She already gives seven Regi ments to tha cans of ths Union and none to th enemy, and bcr people at regular election hav sustained th Union by a large majority, and- a larger ag gregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate or any question. Ken tucky too, (or sometime in doubt, is now decidedly, and I thlik unchangably ranged on tha side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet, and I believe cannot again be overran by th insurgent. These three stt&tes, Maryland, Kentucky and Mis souri, neither or which would promise a sin gle soldier at first, nav now an agrrtgate of not lee than 40,000 Id th field for ths Union, while of thlr oltlsen not more than a third in number ar among th insurgents, and they ot doubtlul whereabouts and ex. Ute nee. After a somewhat bloody struggle of month winter close on th Union people of West era Virginia, leaving tbem masters of their own conntry. A a insurgent fore of about 1500, tor month dominating tha narrow pe ninsular region constituting tbe counties of Aecomac ana Northampton and knows the Eastern Shore of Virginia, together witn soma contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms and ths people there have renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of th old flag. Thi leave no armed force north of the Potomac or east cf th Chesapeake. Also, w hav obtained a footing at each ot th isolated points on the Southern coasts of Hatteras, Port RoyaL Tybee Island near Sa vannah, and Ship If land, and we .likewise have some general accounts ot popular move ments in behalf of the Union in North Caro lina and Tennessee. These things demon strate that the causa of the Union Is advanc ing steadily southward. GEN. SCOTT. Sirne your last adjournment Lieut Gen. Scott has retired from the head of the army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit ; yet on calling to mind how faithfully, ably and brilliantly ha has served tha country, from a time far baok in oar history, when lew of the now living had been bom, and thenceforward continually, I cannot bnt think that we are still his debtor. I submit, therefore, for yoar consideration what farther mark of recognition is due to aim and ourselves as a grateful people. GEN. McCLELLAN. With the retirement of Gen. Scott came the Executive duty of appointing in his place a General-ln-Chlef of th army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country waa there, so far a I know, any difference of opinion a to the proper person to be selected. Tho retiring chief repeatedly expressed - his judgment in favor of Geo. McClellan for tbe position, and in this the nation seemed to give an unanimous concurrence. Tha designation of Gen. MoClellaa Is therefore in a consider able degree the selection of ths country as well as of the Executive, and bene there is better reason to hop there will be given him the confidence and cordial support thos by fair Implication promised, and without which be cannot with so full efficiency rerve the country. It ha been said that one bad General Is bettor than t wo good ones, and th Baying is true, if taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior one at variance ani cross purposes, and the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can have nene bnt a common end in view, and can differ only as to th choice of means. In a storm at tea no one on board can wish the ships to sink, and yet not antreqoently all go down together be cause too many will direct, and no single mind can be allowed to control. It continue to develop that the Insnrreotlon ia largely if not exclusively a war upon the first princi ples of a popular Government and the rights of the people. Oonolusiv evidence of this I found in the most grave and maturely con sidered public documents as well as lo the general tone of the insurgents. In these documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and th denial the people of all right to participate in th selection of public officers, except the legis lative body, advocated with labored argu meats to prove that large control ef the gov ernment in the people la th so ore ef all po uui wru. lnk; tuKir is someume hinted at as a possible refuge froa the error ot th people, in my present position could scarcely be justified, were I to omit raising a warning voice agalut thi ap- ot returning despotism. .
