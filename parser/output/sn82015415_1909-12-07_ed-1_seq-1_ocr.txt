If the British ship Celtic Chief is not yanked off the Kallhl reef today, the German cruiser Arcona may lend her a few pulls tomorrow. Tho Arcona's officers, however, arc hesitating in view of what is declared to bo a peculiar lack of first hand in formation concerning the reefs here abouts, by way of charts. In other words, there does not appear to bo a fully reliable chart of tho vicinage of this harbor. There are better figures to be ob tained of Peah Harbor than can bo as certained concerning the reefs and shoals right off this port. Contemplating giving aid to tho stranded British ship, tho Arcona ap plied to the United States Naval Sta tion for a chart, her officers being an xious to make sure where they were going before getting too close to the Celtic Chief whero sho Is piled up. No satisfaction could be obtained from 11 perusal of the Naval station chart, as far as Immediately outside conditions are concerned, and application was made to the office of the U. S. Engineer whero another chart was obtained. Still wero the officers o.t the German man-of-war dissatisfied and now they have fallen back on their own chart 'which, It Is claimed, is bettor than those obtainable here. An officer of the Arcona this morn ing visited the Celtic Chief in her coral tcradle and set about studying her position, from his own charts. Tho Arcona Is at present busy coal ing and was to have sailed for Yoko hama tomorrow or Thursday morning. If the Britisher is not off tho reef by HWb evening, however, 'the German may give her a line, and a long line at that, .for she doesn't-want to risk leav ing her bone3 on such doubtful ground. Some are inclined to believe that the position of the Celtic Chlof Is moro hopeful today than yesterday, but tho J fact Is she Is about fifty feet further In toward shore than sue was wnen sno OF

WOULD LIKE TO BE INFORMED CHARTS SAID TO LACK DESIRED 1 FIFTY FEET NEAR SHORE struck, having gone closer In while nawsers were breaking on tho long strain. , S. S. Mauna Kea pulled on a stern line all night, not quitting until 7 o'clock this morning, when she had to get to hor wharf to take on freight for Hilo and way ports. As it was her sailing was deferred until one o'clock. The steamers Ml kahala and Helene, alnp of the Inter Island fleet, were left tugging away at the unfortunate vessel, with the In trepid and the Huklhukl. During this morning cargo was transferred from the Celtic Chief, by means of small boats, to tho Mlkahala. She has 2,600 tons of fertilizer in bags aboard and the .process ot taking out her cargo will occupy several days at the present rate. Fortunately the weather today is favorable and the sea is smooth. Whnt will happen to the Celtic Chief in the event of a strong kona wind is not pleasant to contemplate. Being an. Iron vessel, sho can stand a lot of pounding. AVhllo pounding on her keel she will not suffer much, but there is the ever present danger of her pounding her bilges. The hope Is expressed that with some of tho cargo out of her she will rlso from hor cradle, which Is threaten ing to become her coffin, and give to the tugging ot the various vessels with lines on her. There is being considered the pro position of placing kedge anchors out and riggng heavy lines from the after mast to blocks attached to tho kedgos, and so hauling, and another plan sug gested Is to place tho strongest tow di rectly astern with a line from forward of the tow to an anchor so that this straight astern tow boat can keep tho lino taut while two other tugs, ono on either side of tho stranded vessel, can alternately Black and pull and so per haps saw her stern loose.
