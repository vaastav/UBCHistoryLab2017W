Therois nothing of more f< mportmce t" our people than a good ^ 1 system and there is no legislation, (i 'hat they watch with more jealous caro s '.fan that which relates (o the education 1 \ ' their children. I'nfortunately there , c hre many natural c.bstaeles in our State r I to a perfect and systematic working of a 1 free school system. The mountainous and j .i.developed portions, as well a* a sparse 1 pulation in many localities, render anv system inefficient to a certain extent and i o ave to await those changes which w 'A be brought about by an iullux of ' I 1 -at; n to remedy this defect. Yet it Wl i wonderful even in remote and spu > !v opulated districts how much good as been accomplished and h ?w readily be people have taken hold of the public L'hools and interested themselves in vercoiuing the obstacles in the way, and dapted the system to their condition. The ompulsory feature has been tabled and or a while at least this will not be a uestion to discuss, but there is another ueslion that will probably arise in the iscussion of the the bill now before the louse, of even more public interest than he former, and that is the introduction nto or exclusion of the Bible from the chools. This is a question in fact that las two sides to it, and one with so much rgurnent on each that it is difficult to toll rhich is right. Those who advocate Ibe iso of the Bible in tbo public schools, i i?e the sound and plausible argument hat the Iliblo is universally acknowldged to be h good b>?ok; anil if {5UCK'i 1 is? can bo of no possible harm. Again, tbev sav that the Protestant ,nii Koman translati"ns are so near alike hat no ground of otreneo on that score an be given to either of the two great eligious sects of tliis country. Or. the ther hand, there are those who believe iat the spirit and letter of our Constituon which secures the lreedom of coti ience and religious liberty to all, would j violated by compelling those who do <>t accept tlie teachings of holy writ as in juration to receive its doctrines, and gain there aro those who believe that lie religious training of the child should c confined exclusively to the hearthstone r the church, and who dissent from lending secular and religious education -those wlio profess to find warrant for his belief in the w?rd of God itself >y "rendering unto C:e-ar the thinghat are Cesar's, and unto God the tilings hat aro God's " \S ithout desiring to obtrude our iews upon the Legislature, we iave no hesitation in saying that inder all the circumstances the host tsOwvi'ot nrncont w.mlrl Ka tn lr*t il tilonn v.' ?" 

JOVOV... . Neither force the Bible as a text book nto our common schools, nor exclude it >y law. Wherever a teacher sees proper to read or have read i portion of Scripture in he school each day let him do it, hut do lot compel it to ho done nor prohibit it roiii being done. Each community will emulate this matter aec >rding to its own lotions. We are satisticd thut there arthose of the minority party who would iko to drag this question into politics? hey would like to see a Democratic Legislature take a decided stand on one side >r the other of this question, so that they ould go into the n?-xt canvass with upseals to tncreligious prejudices <>f individlals against the opposing political party. VI1 that we have to say in this connection s to let our Democratic friend- act cauiously in this matter, and not be bvtrayd into a false or impolitic position. 'I lio I.Wuinf iirr. roni the liinton Herald. Only ten days of the adjourned session emain, and yet little of importance has ben done. A multitude of unimportant leasurea have been introduced, consumig precious time that should have been estowed upon ether iuattcrs of vital intortance to the interests of tiio whole late. There seems to be no man in the lower louse w ho has the capacity to assume he leadership, and direct the energies of he inexperienced members. Every nan is going it on his own hook, 0 to speak, all anxious and willing to do Dtncthing, but the troublo is they don't now how. The Senate gels along with ;g business with ease and disiatch, and will likely havo disused of the most important bills . hen the thirty days terminate. The rouble seems to be altogether in the louse, where everything is apparently 1 confusion. The Radical members re generally men of capacity, and are oing all in their power to hinder and j eiay legislation, with a view of bring- ! tg the Democrat e party into disreuto. The whole impeachment busi- ! .as a Radical trick to divide and ! istract the dominant party; and j Irunge to say, the leaders of our par- ! y so far have failed to see through this j au/.y device, and have frittered away a ood part of the session in listening to j vug-winded speeches from the managers j f the impeachment, the ruling spirits of j Much aru Radicals of the deepest dye.

FOREIGN. Nieitmcr Lost. LoKI?oh, December 7.?Tile following is a verbatim copy of Lloyd's telogrun from ilarmichie, in regard to the Doutch land: The steamer Doutch land fron liremon for Mew York, with emigrants grounded on Kentish Knock at 5 o'clock on Monday morning, during a heavj northoast gale. The weather was thick with snow. The crow and passenger: were drowned. The Ueutcniana nai beaten over the Kentish Knoik, and is now in four-and-a-half fathoms of water She lias apparently parted amidships When Captain Hrickenstein left tin steamer she was full ot water, which wai rising and falling with the tide.

The Deutchland was wrecked on MenJay morning, but it was deemed irnpraolieable to send assistance until the gab moderated. At I o'clock this morning the tug Liverpool brought in fifty-one persons, including all the officers except the fourth. Ona child died on hoard the tug. The number of dead bodies in the steamer's i-.-ihin was fl It v. and others art probably in the boats which are missing. So far only about tifty-four are known to be saved. Keck, the quartermaster, is apparently dying, lie is swollen, blackened appearance indicating a froslbight. llis statement was given with greai difficulty, lie said his boat was attached to the ship by a rope which broke, and tho boat fell to leeward. As there were no oarsit was impossible to return, so a sail was rigged and tho boat drove bclore lho wind all day and the following night. The steerage passenger, named Foster, was lightly clad and without shoes and stockings. He soon died, and the seaman shortly after. At 6 o'clock this morning a boat was perceived by an artillery man on duty at Fort Shcarness, and Beck was rescued. Tho Captain says that tho distress signals wore answered from the Light vessels and the coast guard stationed at Harwhich during Monday evening, but owing to tho liorccness of the gale, it was impossible to send assistance. No life boat was to t>e had, and none other could livo. The icene at tho wreck on the arrival of the tug, defies description. Strong men, women and children wero clinging to the rigging, Iroui which many had been washed away. Some were in their IhnI strug gle?. In the. cabin were wn corpses 01 Indies and ohiliron just as tliey retired. Ono hundred and forty persons were taken ofl'by the tug, with scanty clothing. Arriving at Harwich they were laaen charge of by the Herman Consul, Oliver .Fohn Williams, who provided them with food, clothing and lodging, and glad rest, after so many hours ?l exposure to the most severe frost experienced this winter.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE i 1 | * j To the Senate awl Home of Rejtresentaa | tines: J In submitting rny seventh message to i Congress in this Centennial year of our * | national existence, as a free and independi | ent people, it affords me great pleasure 1 j to reeur to the advancement that has * | been made from the time of the colonies 1 I one hundred years ago. We were then j I a people numbering only 8.000,000; now : we number more than 50000,000. Then I industries wero confined almost exclusive i iy to the tillage of the; ' j soil; now manufactories absorb j \ ; much ot the labor of the country. Our j liberties remain unimpaired. The bonds- J * j men have been freed from slavery, and wo have become possessed of the ro< | spect if not the friendship of nil civil4 j lzod nations. Our progress has l?een * | great in all the arts, in science, agri- \ i ; culture, commerce, navigation, mining, _ j mechanics, law, medicine, etc.. And in i I in a manner most nauering lomeir pnae, i but for tho extraordinary grade and abil- j itv of our mechanics the achievements, j of our agriculturists, manufacturers and , transporters throughout tho country , would have been impossible of attainaient. Tho progress of tho miner lias ! also been great, Of coal, our production was small, now many millions of loon nm niinea annually So with iron which formed 6careean appreciable part of our products a half a century ago. Wo now produce more j than the world consumed Ht the begin- [ ningofour national existence. lead, zinc and copper from being articles ol imports, we nrny expect to be large ex- j ports in the near lulurc. The devol- i opments of gold and silver mines j i throughout, the States and territories ha- j not only been remarkable, but lias had a j large effect upon the business i of all commercial nations. : Our merchants in the last one hundred years have hail a success, and have estatelished a reputation for enterprise sagacitv, progress and integrity unsurpassed bv the people of older nationalities. This good name is not confined to their i homes, hut goes i ut on every sea and into every port where commerce enters. ; With equal pride we can point to our i progress in all of the learned professions. : As we are now about to enter upon our second centennial, commencing our manhood as a nation, it is well to look back I uoon the nasi and study what will be best to preserve and advaneh our future j greatness. From the fall of Adam for j his transgression to the present day, no ; nation has ever been free from threat- j ened dangers to its prosperity and | happiness. We should look to the dan- j gers which threaten us, and remedy | 1 thein so far as lies in our power. We j j are a republic whereof one is as good as j I another before the law. Under such a j form ol government, it is of the greatest I importance that ull should he possessed of an education, with intelligence enough to cast a vote with a right understanding of its meaning. A large association of ignorant men cannot for any considerable period oppose n successful resistance to such tyranny as oppression from the ; educated few. They will inevitably ' -ink or acquiesce to the will of intelli-i geiicc, whether directed by the present ' or hereafter; hence education of the masses becomes of the tir?t necessity lor the preservation of our institutions I They arc worth preserving because they have secured the greatest good to the j greate-t proporti< n of the po"pie of any | foreign government yet devised. All J other governments just approach it in | proportion to the genera! diffusion <>f ed! ucation and independence of thought and j and action. Amendment lo the (oiistlltillon. "As tho primary step therefore ' to our advancement in ail that has marked our progress in tho pa.-t conturv, I j suggest for your earnest eonsidoratior : and mo.?t earnestly recommend it that a constitutional amendment j bo submitted to the legislatures of the ; several States for ratification, making it the duty of each of the several States to j establish and forever maintain free puis- i lie schools adequate to the education of all the children in the rudimentary i branches within their respective limits I 1 irrespective of rex, color, birth place or I I religion; forbidding the teaching in said 1 schools of religious, atheistic or pagan texts, and prohibiting the granting of any school funds or school tuxes or any part lhereo', cither hv legi-lativo, municipal i or othpr Government, for the benefit ul any other object oi any naturo or kind ; whatever. 1 nliiinl Cnnrrli Properly. In connection with this important que-lion, I would also call your attention , J to the importar.ee of correcting an evil , ; that, if permitted to continue, will proba. bly load to great trouble in our land be' fore the close of the nineteenth century , It 16 the accumulation ofvit-t amounts of | untaxed church property. In I860. I believe, the church property of the I , United States which paid no tax, munii ! cipal or State, amounted to about $83,000,000; in 1860 the amount had doubled; in 1875 it is about $1.000,000,000. and by 1H00, without a check, it is sate to say i that this property will reach a sum cx; , cecding $3,000,000,000. So vast a 'am ' I receiving all the protection and benefit- , ,! general education, the progress is iikeI wiso encouraging. Our thirteen States have become thirty-eight, including Colorado, which has taken the initiatory - steps to become a State, and i eight territories, including tho - Indian Territory and Alaska, and ex. eluding Colorado, making a territory exit tending from the Atlantic to tho I'acilic. i, On the south we have extended t.i the ) <*illf of Mexico and in tho West from the i Mississippi to the Pacific. One hundred years ago tlie cott<>n gin, . tho railroad, tho telegrapn, the reaping. 1 ' sowing and modern printing machine? , | and various other inventions of scarce- | { lj I cm value t<> our business i . and happiness wore entirely unknown, i In 177*), mnnufacturcrs scarcely ex- ! ; istodeven in name in all this vast torri- ! . tory. In 1890 more than two millions <?f I . persons were employed in manufacturing, I . producing more tlian $2,110,000,000 of j t produce in amount annually, nearly ! c?|ual to our national debt, nearly the 1 . whole of the populace of 1770 being engaged in the one occupation of agriculture. In 1870so numerous and divosifn-d . had become the occupations of our pooi i pic, that less than six millions out of ! more than forty millions were so en- 1 , gaged. The extraordinary effect pro, ducod in our country by a resort to such | . occupations, has built a market for the ' | products of fertile lands distant from the [ . seaboard and tho markets of tho world. ) The American system of working | I various and extensive manufactures next I j to tho plow and the pasture, and adding ! i tho connecting railroad and steamboat has produced in our distant country a result not equalled by tho intelligent parts of other nations. The Ingenuity and skill of American mechanics have been demonstrated at homo and abroad iktn f of the government, without bearing iU proportion of the burden ot the expenses ot the same, will not be looked upon with acquieseense bv those who have paid tuxes. In a growing country, where real estatee nhunces so rapidly with time as in the United States, there is scarcely a limit to the wealth that mav be acquired by corporations, religious or otherwise, If ullowcd to retain real estate without the taxation herein contemplated, it may lead to trouble. 1 suggest the taxation of all property equally, whether church or corporation, except- ' ing only the last resting place of the 1 dead, and possibly with proper restrictions of church edifices. . Kiirt ltn KrlHlluut. With most ot the foreign powers wo continue on satisfactory foot- | ing. The increused intercourse, the j extension of commerce and ; cultivation of mutual interests have , steadily improved our relations with the ' largo majority of the powers of the j world, rendering practicable the peace- j ful solution of the questions which, from time to time, necessarily arise, leaving few which demand extended or oarticu lai notice. The correspondence of the Department of State with our diplomatic | representatives abroad is transmitted 1 herewith. 1 am happy to announce the passage of an act by j the Cortes of ' Portugal, ! proclaimed since the adjournment of i Congress for the abolition of servitude in j the Portugese colonies. It is to be hoped that such legislation may be another step toward the great consummation to be ! reached, when no man shall be permitted j directly or indirectly, under any guise, I excuse or fear of a law. to hold bisjfellow i man in bondage. I am of opinion, also, j that it is the duty of the United States, : as contributing toward that end j and required by the spirit of the | age. Chili lias made reparation in the I case of the whale ship (iood I Kcturn, seized without sufficient cause | upwards of forty years ago, though she j had hitherto denied her accountability. | The demand was never acquiesced in by | this government and the justice of the J claim has been so earnestly contended for I that it lias been gratifying that she should have at last acknowledged it. Thoarhi- j trators in the case of the United States steamer Monti go, for tho seizure and do j tention of which the government of tho United States of Columbia was held accountable, have decided in favor of the claim. This decision has settled the question which has been pending for several voars. and which while it continued, might more or less disturb the good understanding which it is desirable should bo m&intainsd betweon tho republics. A reciprocity treaty with the King of tho Hawaiian Islands was concluded some months ago, but it contains a stipulation that it shall not go into effect until Congress shall enact the proper legislation for tho purpose. In March last an arrangement was made through Mr. Cushing, our minister in Madrid, with the SpanishGoyernment for tho payment by tho latter to the United States of the sum of $80,000 in coin for tho purpose of tho reuei ot tuo iamiiies urine person of the ship and certain passengers of the Virgin ilia, this sum was to have b?en paid in three installments of two months each. It is duo to the Spanish Government that 1 should .state that the ; payments wore fully and speedily an- | ticipated by that Government and" thut | the whole nmount was paid within but j a few davs more than two months from j Lhc dale of tho ii^re?,nn,nt. a ropy of which is herewith transmitted. In pur- ; suance of the terms in the adjustment I j bavo directed the distribution of the [ amount among parties entitled thereto, including the ship Co. ana such of the I passengers as were American citizens.' l'aymerits are made accordingly or ap plication of the parties entitled thereto. I The <11 bun Qneatlwii. Some of the rumors of the conflicts which have been raging for seven years i in the neighboring Island of Cuba on thesaine di.sregardjof the laws of civilized warfare and the just demands of humanity which have heretofore called forth exprcs-ions of condemnation from the , nations of Christendom, have.continued | to blacken the sad scono of de-elation, ruin and pillage that are pervading the j rich fields of one ot the most fertile and < productive regions of the earth. The incendiaries' torch is still tiring plantations and valuable factories and buildings, and is the agent marking the alternate advance or retreat of contending parlies. The protracted continuance of the strife seriously allocts the interests of all commercial nations, but those of the United States more than others, by reason of its close proximity, its large trade and intercourse with Cuba, and frequent intimate personal and social relations which have grown up between its citizens Hiid those of the island. Moreover, the property of our citizens in Culm is large, and is rendered insecure and depreciated in value and in the capacity of production by the continuation of the strife and the unnatural mode of its conduct. The same is true, differing only in degree with respect to the interest of the people of other nations, and the absence of any reasonable assurance of a near termination of the conflict, must of necessity soon compel the Stales thus sutlcrtng, to consider what the interests of their own people and their duty toward themselves may demand. I have hoped that Spain would be en aMed toe-laoiisn peace in jut cutout. 10 ; aiord security to the property and the | interests of our citizens, and allow a legitimate ?c>pe to trade and commerce and tlie natural interest-of the 1-land. Because of this hope and from an extreme reluctance to interfere in the most remote 1 manner in the ntlairs of another and friendly nation, and especially of one 1 whose sympathy and friend-hip in the ' struggling infancy of our own existence, must ever lie remembered with gratitude. I have patiently and anxiously waited the progress of events. Our own civil conflict is too recent for us not to consider the difficulties which ! surround a government distracted by s drnastic rebellion 11 home, a*, the same time that it has to cope with a separat insurrection in a di-tant colonv. Bu whatever causes may have produced He- : situation which so genenerally af-ctour interests., it exists with all jts eviloperating directly upon this country arid its people. Thus far all the resorts of Spain have proved abortive an 1 time has worked no improvement in the situation. The armed bands of either side now occupy nearly the same ground as in the past, with the difference of time and more lives -acrificed, more property destroyed,and wider extent' of fertile snd productive fields, and' more valuable property constantly and wantonly sacrificed to the indendiary's torch. In contests of this nature, where aconsidorable body of people who have attempted to free themselves from the control of the supreme government have reached such a point iu the occupation i I , . . _ NO. 140. ? ???? I cf territory in power and in general y. ganizatiou as constitute in lact a body i politic, Laving a government in substance as well as in name, possessed of elements of stability and equipped with the maj chinery lor the administration of internal policy and the execution of its law. and prepared and able to administer justice at Lome us well as its dealings with other powers, it is within the province of those other powers to recognize its existence a- a new and independent nation In such eases other nations simply deal recognize as one of the powers of the earth, with an actual condition of things, and that body politic, which, possessing the necessary elements, has in fact, become a new power; in a word, the creation of ? new State is a fact to establish this condition of things essentially. While conscious that the insurrection in Cuba has shown a strength and endurance which makes it at least doubtful whether it be in the power of Spain to subdue it, it seems unquestionable that no such civil organization exists which may bo recognized a- an independent go\ernment, capable oi performing its obligations and entitled t<> be treated as olio of the powers oi we carm. necogiiuion unocr such circumstances would bo inconsisl ent with the facts, and would compel tinpowers to support by force, the government to which it had really given its only real claim ot existence. In nn judgment the United .States should ad hero to the policy ai.d the privileges which have heretofore been its sure and safe guides in like contests bctwia-n the revolted colonics and their mother country, and acting only upon lliu clearest evidence, should avoid any possibility of suspicion or imputation, a recognition of the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion, impracticable and indefensible. KcrogMltion of lla'lllitereut ICIglit*. The question which next presents it.-clt is that of the recognition of bolligornt lights of the parties in the contest. 1 n a former message to Congress I had occasion to consider this question and reached the conclusion that the conflict in Cuba, dreadful as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful dignity of war Regarding it now, after this lapse .1 time, 1 am unalde to see any notable success or that any marked or real advance on the part of the insurgents has essentially changed the character ol the conllict. It has acquired great*"' age but not greater nor more formidable pre portions. It was possible that thJ H.'ts oi foreign powers and even tl>" acts of Spain herself of this iiatC" might bo point oil to in dofc1"'0 oi mi*, nut now, as in it* p*'t history, the United States staoi?o carefully avoid tho laN.i lights wht-'h might lead it into the maze* ot doubtful law and of questionable propriety,persist in her rigidenforceiicnt of thi rule which has been her safeguard and in doing which she dy.* wbaJ is right and honest, and of good report. The question ot according or withholding the rights of belligerency must be judged on every caso in view of the particulars attending the fttoio, I'nles- justified by necessity, it is always justly regarded as an unfriendly act and gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion, and it is required t? have the interests and riglit> of another government, or of its people, so far atieelcd by pending conflict as to demand it; Lmtlhi*conflict must be one which will be recognized in the sense of international law a- war belligerents, too. It is a fact, the mere existence of armed bodies and their occasional conflicts do not constitute war in the sense referred to. In applying to the condition of alliiirs in f'uha the 'tests recognized by publicists ami writers on international law, and which have been observed l>v nations of dignity, honesty and power, when free from sensitive or m-IIMi and unworthy motives, I (nil to tin 1 in tie insurrection, the existenceof such n substantial politn'iil organization a- would be really palpable ami manifest to the world, having the forms and being < a pa able ot' the ordinary tunetions of govern rnont towards its own people, and to the ther States, with Courts lor the udmiiiis [ration of justice; with a local habitation possessing such an organization of forces and material, with ttie or. upation of the territory, as to take the contest out ot the category of a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skit mishes, and place it on the terrible footing ot war, to which a re<ignition of belligerency would mm to elevate it. The contest, moreover, is rolely on land. The insurrection has not possessed itself ol a single sea port from whence it may send forth it? (lag, nor has it any means of communication with foreign powers, except through the milt tary lines of its advcr-ariim. No appro (tensions ot any of those sudden complications which a war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the ves ols, both commercial ana National, and upon the consular officers of other powers culls for the definition of the relations of the parties to this contest. Considered as a question of expediency, I regard the accordance of belligerent rights still to he as unwise and premature as 1 regard it to he at present indefensible as a measure of right. Such recognition entails upon the (s)untry accordingjit, the r gh a which fbiW from its difficult and complicated duties, slid requires the adieu from the contending parties of the strict observance of their rights and obligations. It confers the right of search upon the high s-as by vessels of faith parties; it would subject the carrying of guns and ammunition ?.t war. wtiieti now may lit) transported fr?*ely and without interruption in the ve.se!? of the United State*, to detention and possiblyseizure. It would give ri>e to countless vexatious question-, would relea-e the parent Government from re. sponsibility for act- done hy the insurgent*, and would invest Spain with the right to exorcise tlm supervision recognized hy our treaty of 17Vo over our commerce on the high - >?*, a very large part ot whieb, in its traffic between the Atlantic and Gulf Stat'*, and between all of them and the State, up >n the Paoitio, passes through the waters which wash the shore* of Cuba The exorcise of this supp -.lion could scarcely fail to lead to collisions ruinou? to the peaceful relation* ef thetwo StateThere can be little doubt to what result such a supervision would, before long, draw this nation. It would he unworthy of the United States to inaugurate tic possibility of sueh a result by measure* of questionable right or expediency or by any indirection. Apart from any question of the oretical right, I am satisfl -d while the accordance of belligerent rights to the Insurgents in Cuba, might give them a hoped for inducement to prolong the struggle, it would be a delusive hope, and would Hot remove the evils wnich this Government and it? people are experiencing, but would draw the United States in a compli , Lunc'u<U<l o?
