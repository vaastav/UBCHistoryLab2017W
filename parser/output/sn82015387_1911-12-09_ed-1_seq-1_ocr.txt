Meet in Covington and Talk Over Matter of Service. Better Time Will be Given If Stops are Cut Down. Road Willing to Do What It Can to Improve Service. In response to a request of the Executive Committee of the Coving ton Commercial Club, officials of the New Orleans Great Northern Rail road Company met the Committee and a number of the citizens of Cov ingtozi, Monday afternoon, at the of fices of the company in the depot. Notification that the officials would be in Covington at that time came too latp to have at the meeting all those that it was intended should be there, as it was cbnsidered that Abita Springs and other towns on the road were equally interested in the matter of securing a better schedule and in the general discus . ion of railroad service. There Were present, however. H. R. How Ard, general manager; John L. Davis, superintendent of transpor tation; .M. J. McMahon, general pas menger agent; G. H. Gussing, sup el~ntendent of motive power; Mayor G. M.. .Marrero, H. J. Smith, Dr. R. ,. Toson, A. C. McCormack, Ed In n6 Stern, James Mullally, J. , Louis Smith, P. J. Lacroix, Robert , Badon, T.. GabrieL, Anatole Beau .: ·· egudray and W. G. Davis, :' J. San ders, D. H. Mison and W. H. Kent, ' Mr. Jb' L. Davis speaking for the railroad company, entered into quite lengthy details in explanation of the causes of the present defec tive sbrvice. His plea was that this branch of 'the road was not now pay tug the company; that the road was paying 5 per cent on $8,000,000 of bonds and $14,000 per month to the Northeastern for the use of their tracks to Slidell, and that in fact the road might be better off if that ser vice were discontinued. He stated that it was ,to. .the ,terest of 'the Soompany :teapy portion Shive. repair work done t they wer6 somewhat crip en' this account; but that they expected soon to have two new foco motives,. which would greatly ease '. t the situation and would enable them to keep ;up the schedule time. The chair ear,, he said, had been taken off for repairs and would be placed back if we desired it. He further stated that if we compell the com pany to meet all our requirements and that in consequence the road was' forced into the hands of a re ceiver, ,it would then be run under the control of the receiver, free from the interferencce df the Railroad Commission, and that we would only get, such service as the profits de manded. Mr. Davis seemed to be fair and S honest in discussing the situation and left the impression that the road was willing to do what it could to better conditions. Manager Howard statde that he thought five minutes or more might be cut off the schedule by eliminat inag some of the lost time at North Slidell, and if, as suggested' by Mr. McMahon; the stop at Claiborne and Osone Park could be cut out ten min ades more could be taken from the schedule. * Mr. Davis also spoke of the fact that their agreement with the Northeastern called for time of not less than one hour and ten minutes between New Orleans and Slidell; hence all improvement in the sched ule must be made between Slidell and Covington, and as there were ,eleven stops, inclusive, the actual running time was about as good as could be expected. It was the stops that lengthened it. The general feeling is that if the railroad will do what it can for Cov lagton the people will gladly do what they can to make it a paying prop osition.

LYON, Supt. of Public Education. PRESIDENT ON SHERMAN ACT His Third Annual Message Confined to It Only. Defends Act as Interpreted by the Supreme Court. Declares It Effective in Dis solutiou of Trusts. Refers to Message of 1910 on Federal Incorporation. Washington, Dec. 5.--President Taft's third annual message to Con gress, devoted exclusively to the Sherman anti-trust act and the trust question in general, was read in Congress to-day. The president defended the Sher man act as interpreted by the Su preme Court of the United States, Indicated plainly his opposition to the repeal or amendment of this statute,, but suggested that Congress pass a Federal incorporation law and supplemental legislation that "would describe and denounce methods of competition that are unfair." To supervise corporations charter ed under the Federal law, President Taft proposed the creation of an ex ecutive bureau, or commission, with powers akin tothose of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Speaking of the much-discussed dissolution of the tobacco trust, the president declared that, in his opin ion, "not in the history of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered by a court." Portions of his message of Janu ary, 1910, proposing Federal incpr poration, were referred to in this message. 

STATUTE IS NEGATIVE. "I renew," continued the presi dent, "the recommendations of the enactment of a general law provid ing for, the voluntary formation of corporations to engage in trade and commerce among the states and for eign nations. It is even more mani fest now than it was then that the denunciation of conspiracies -Ia re straint of trade should not an4 does not mean the denial of orgniza tions large enough to be int ,sed with, our interstate ore. It hai be en than, ifwags: c provisions for the buildig ºp and regulation of legitimate nation al and foreign commerce." The supplemental legislation the presidenf desires is explained in a paragraph: "The attempt and pur pose to suppres a competitor by un derselling him at a price so unprofit able as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are required to give up associations with other manufacturers and num erous kindred methods for stifling competition and effecting monopoly should be described with sufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten its task by prosecuting single misdemeanors, instead of an entire conspiracy; and, on the other hand, to serve the purpose of point ing out more in detail to the busi ness, community what must be avoided." 

MORE ABOUT THE PRIZES FOR BIBLE STUDY. The object of the International Press Bible Question Club is to pro mote through the press, thought and investigation on the teaching of Scripture in connection with the In ternational Sunday School Lessons. To this end some very valuable prizes are offered on very simple terms. There are to be given to the Farmer's readers in connection with the other papers that join the I. P. B. Q. C. during the current three months fifty prizes, viz: Five solid gold medals, five sterling silver medals, five teachers' Bibles, worth $5.50 each, thirty-five copies of "The Heart of Christianity," price $1.50 each. This book is said to be the best thing written, in this century, on its vital subject. The gold and silver medals are beautifully engrav ed with an emblematic desikn and the name of the winner will be en graved on the reverse side. It will be no small honor to be a gold or silver medalist in this gerat inter national organization. Any person who takes up this simple course of study stands a .good chance of re ceiving that honor. The simple questions are: 1. That commencing February 18, 1912 the International Sunday School Les sons must be read and "The Sug gestive Questions" for fifty-two con secutive weeks, and a coupon should be cut from this paper each week and signed, certifying to the reading. 2. Must answer in writing any five of the questions that are indicated to be so answered, getting help from any source, if that is necessary. 3. Within one week of the' close of the contest must deliver to this office all the coupons which have been cut out, together with the five written answers. The prizes will then be awarded to those who hand in the greatest number of coupons. If two or more send in an equal number of Eoupons, the tie, or ties, will be brok en by an examination of the written eawers, and the prizes will be awarded to 'those who get the high est number of marks from an im Dartial examination of the answers.
