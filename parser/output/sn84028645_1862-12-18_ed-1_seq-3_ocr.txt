Mr. Stevens, from the oeumittee of Ways ana Means, reported a Din mailing appropria tions for invalid and other pensions. Its con sideration was postponed till Monday next. Mr. btevens also reported a bill to supply de ficiency in appropriations for 16G3; whioh waa made tbe speolal order for Tuesday next. The House then went Into committee of tbe Whole on the President's message. Mr. Noel of Missouri argued that tbe present organised uemooratio party aid not render un qualified support to the war, but was oontlnually tnrowing ODataoiea m ine way or lis prosecu tion, tie unaeriooK to say mat it was a delu sion to think that this war might bare been prevented by the adoption of the- Crittenden compromise, ll wae true that some of the leaders of the rebellion had roled for that com promise, but tbe history of subsequent events shows tbat if ten or twelve rotes had been nec essary to defeat that meaeuro, they could hare been procured. He would go further, and say tbat there waa nothing in tbe Crittenden com promise that would have prevented the rebel lion. The enemies of the Administration beld out the idea that tbe war was not for the res toration of peace, but for the abolition of slavery; but this waa nntrue, although such might be the result. 1 hey assert that tbe Ad ministration tramples on the Constitution, and all the' rights and privileges under that Instru ment are to be swept by the board, and that the Union la to be contended for without the Constitution. He had witnessed some of these so-called violations of tbe Constitution. When the war broke out, the enemies of tbe country were not confined to rebel States, but were eoattered all over the land. Never waa a con spiracy so well ooncooted. notwithstanding me opinion ot Judges Taney aud Story as to the President's being guilty of a violation of the Constitution in suspending tbe privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, he justified President Lincoln In doing so. It was bis duty to use all means to suppress the rebel lion; Confiscation of rebel property ia another pretext for making war on tbe Administration, men of the border States who have been tram pled in the dust take it as unkind that tbe enemies of tbe war expend tbelr sympathies only upon the wives and children of men en gaged In the rebellion. The border Stales wish to see retaliation visited on tbe rebels for their crimes. Again, tho enemies of this war exhibit fright ful pictures of the finanolal condition of tbe country; but those who got np rebellion are responsible lor every drop ol blood, every dol lar of extraordinary expenditure and for all Irregularities committed. Mr. Noel proceeded to contrast tbe ooorse of the anti-war party of 1813 witb that of the present day, insisting that the parallel was perfect. Ia this conneo tion be quoted the position ot the Federalists of Massachusetts at tbat time. Mr. Thomas of Massachusetts, Interrupting, said: If the gentleman from Missouri desired in any way to give character to tbe class of men whom both of them condemned namely, the peace Democrats he conld not have pursued a more efieotual course, for the old Federalists of New England were the most honest party that ever lived beneath tho throne of God. v Mr. Noel, resuming, said be started with the proposition that the present organized Demo cratic party was inconsistent. When slavery comes in as an element of rebel strength, and the question la presented betweon its perpetua tion and the preservation ot tbe Union, tbon let the former die. Caibo, Deo. 17.
