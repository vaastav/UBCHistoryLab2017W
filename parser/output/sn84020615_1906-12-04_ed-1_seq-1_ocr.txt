Such a violation of the law, la my opinion. In Ha essen tial nature, is a very much more hein ous net than the ordinary common, vul gar crimes which come before criminal courts constantly for punishment and whlchi arise from sudden passion or temptation. This crime in this case Was! committed by men of education and of large business experience, whoso stand- 1 , Inn In tho community wus such that ! 1 they might have been expected to Bet an I example of obedience to low. upon the ' OUeStiOnS Are ' maintenance of which alone in this i v.. mr on uiiij oi iiit-n ji ji- ( v depends.

Is charged with the highest obligation In the tninsaction of Its business to treat the citizens of this Country alike, and not to carry on Its business with unjust I discriminations between different citr- ' lens or different classes of citizens. This crime in Its nature Is one usually i done with secrecy, and proof of which It I is very difficult to obtain. K'ver since j that time complaints of the granting of j rebates by railroads has been common, I urgent, and Insistent, umi altho the con- I arena has repeatedly past legislation en ' deavuring to put a stop to this evil. that ditliculty of obtaining proof upon whlchi to bring prosecution In these cases ts so great that this is the first case that has ' ever ln-en brought In this court, ami, aa I 1 m Informed, this case and one recent- I ly broiiKht in Philadelphia, are the onlf I ; cmbi'S tliat have ever heen brought t the eastern part of this country. tfi fact, but few cases of this kind have ever been brought in this country, enst or west.

American people as a whole. In auch event the people will turn to, and tend to accept as Justlllable, the Intemperate nd improper criticism uttered .by un worthy anliutors. Surely It Is a mis fortune to leave to such critics a func tion, right In Itself, wu.ch they are cer tain to abuse. Just and temperate criti cism, when necessary.

LYNCHING. In connection with the delays of the law. I call your attention and the atten tion of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us. and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mop violence that spring up. now In one part of our country, now In another. Kuch section, north, south, east, or west, bus Its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend Its time jeering at the faults of another section; It should lie busy try ing to amend its own shortcomings. To riiiil with the crime of corruption It Is necessary to have an awakened public ronscience. and to supplement this by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty In the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more Is necessary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime Is peculiarly frequent In rcsnect to black men. The greatest existing cause ot lynching Is Hie perpetration, especially hy black men, of tho hideous crime of rape the i most nbomluable In all the cateaorv of crimes, even worse than murder.

It mi ms an absurdity to per mit a single district Judge, against what may be the judgment oi" the immense majority of his colleagues on the bench. to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress u bo "unconstitutional.'' I ami then to deny to the government the right to have the supreme court deii nitely decide the question. It is well to recollect that the real ef. Ililcncy of the law often depends not upon the passage of acts as to which there is great public excitement, but Ui, m tne passage ot acts tit this nature necessary aa to which there is not much public excitement, Im-cuuho there Is little public understanding of their Importance, while the interested parties are keenly alive to the desirability of defeating them. The importance of enacting Into law the particular bill in question is further increased by the fact that the government bus now definitely begun a pulley of resorting to the criminal law in those trust and Interstate commerce cases where such a course offer a reas onable chance of success. At first, as was proper, every ePort was made to enforce these laws by civil proceedings; but it bus become increasingly evident that the action of the government in fin ally deciding. In certain cases, to under take criminal proceedings was Justifi able; and tho there have been some con spicuous failures In these cams, we have that etli-ct w Ul lie entered In this case. SETTING ASIDE OF JUDGMENTS AND GRANTING OF NEW TRIALS Tu connection with this matter. I would like to cull attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law. resulting in large part from the habit of setting asifle the Judgments- of infer ior courts on technicalities absolutely unconnected with the merits of the case, and where there is no' attempt to show that there has been any failure of substantial Justice. It would be well to enact a law providing something to the effect that: No Judgment shall lie set ssiiie r new trial granted In uny cause, civil or crim inal, on the ground of misdirection of the jury or the Improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for error as to any mutter of pleading or procedure nnl...

Such a Judge is deserving of all honor; and all honor can not lie paid to this wise and fearless judge If we per mit tlie growth of an absurd convention which would forbid uny criticism ot the Judgo of another type, who shows him self timid in the presence of arrogant disorder, or who on Insufficient grounds grants an Injunction that diws grave injustice, or who In his capacity us a construcr. and therefore in part a maker, of the law. In flagrant fusblon thwarts the cause of decent government. The Judge has a power over which no review can be exercised; he himself aits In review upon the aits of both the ex- whilH a considerable nroeortlon of the Individuals lynched are Innocent of oil crime.' Governor Candler, of Georgia, stated on one occasion some years ago: "I can say of a verity that have, with in the last month, saved the lives of half a down Innocent nentroes who were pursued by the mob, and brought them to trial in a court ot at law In which they were aisiultted."

The lesson Is this: No good citizen can afford to countenance a rie-llanc-e of the statutes, no matter what the provocation. The Innocent fri-qiient-ly sutler, and.
