A Four Power agreement to replace the Anglo Japanese alliance will be announced at an open session shortly, according to reports today from authoritative quar ters. It is understood that preliminary reports approving this agreement have been received from Tokio by the Jap anese delegation. The discord in the Far East situation remains, however, due to Chinese bitterness over what they regard as a virtual right of way for Japan to cement its hold on Man churia and retain a part of the Shan tung railway. It is believed the Quad ruple Entente aggreement, providing for "mutual discussion and avoidance of difficulties," is already in writing and ready for signature. By P. M. Sari, United Press staff correspondent. LONDON, Dec. 7, One of the most amazing aspects of post-war diplomacy is the constant irritation and friction between Downing Street and the Quai d'Orsay, since the framing of the r sailles treaty. While the respective premiers and foreign ministers profess to be in com plete agreement, there would seem to be always some high officials on one, or both, sides of the English Channel per petuating the friction. v British diplomats do not attempt to conceal their astonishment over the re cent foreign policy of France, and pro fess their inability to sec what France has to gain by antagonizing friendly . big powers for the sake of negotiations with smaller nations and even unrepre sentative factions.

The authority mentioned was quite frank and fully conceded that France's war losses justified, to a great extent, a certain amount of suspicion of her Allies when it came to suggested con- ressirn5 to Germanv in the matter nf reparations, indemnities, etc., but he maintained that any such suspicions or differences could be better threshed out m iranic personal conterences hetween ministers. "France's occupation of Frankfort last year, and the recent Wiesbaden agreement between the French and German ministers of reconstruction (Loucbeur and Rathenau) did nothing to case the reparations question, and in addition to further exasperating Ger many, they only irritated France's al lies by reason of the abrupt manner in which they were undertaken without previous consultation with the Allies England had no objection to the Wies baden agreement in principle, but the foreign office was greatly offended by the manner in which it was concluded, declared the diplomat. The most flagrant instance of disre gard for British feelings, according to officials here, was the agreement con 1 eluded with Mustapha Kemal at An (gora by the French commissioner, Franklin Bouillon, which despite the tri-partite agreement between France, England and Italy, virtually recogniz ed a belligerent not officially recogniz ed by these powers, and conceded to Kemal territory which France never possessed and which she only held un der a mandate from the League of Na tions. British and French interests have fre quently clashed in Asia Minor, but since the Kemalist revolt against the authority of the sultan, there have been several nasty jars. France's claim to the Damascus "sphere of influence" en abled her to summarily eject Emir Feisul, the Anglophile Arab chieftain,, who was elected king of Syria. Eng land didn't like this, and it took her some time to pacify Feisul, but she re cently found the Arab potentate an other kingdom in Mesopotamia. The British diplomatic view is that France has nb geographical or logical locus standi in Asia Minor, and that her pres ence there is purely obstructive.

Should the plans be carried out several plants will be established between Empire and Dayton. General Wrangel jarred the Allied chancelleries, but the open and under ground support by French diplomats of Poland's aggressive designs on Soviet Russia,, Lithuania, Germany and other neighbors very nearly caused serious complications. "The French policy of continual 'pin pricks' and annoyances can only have unfortunate results. If we could see what France was aiming at, or detect justification for a Machiavellian policy designed to produce future results, we should take these things in the ordinary 'diplomatic' way and discount or coun ter them accordingly. But we cannot see what France hopes to gain. A po sition of isolation in the midst of an ir ritated world cannot profit any coun try, especially a country like France which is still staggering under the war losses and burdens.'
