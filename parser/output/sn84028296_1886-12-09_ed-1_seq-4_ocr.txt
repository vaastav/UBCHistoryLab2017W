The meeting is for the purpose of considering the follow ing questions: 1. What reforms are needed in the selections of teachers? 2.

I need not add one word in favor of these claims. They have passed the point of argu ment; all agree to their just foundation." This declaration of Commissioner Black is in keeping with the sentiment of the people. The veterans of the war of 1846 are justly entitled to recognition by the government. OT With the exception of ihe Mail and Express all the Democratic papers in New York City are opposing Cleveland's ndmin istration. Findhiii Jeff, Oh, we guess not. Can't you let up on fibbing for a little while? There is not a Dem ocratic paper in New York which is opposing Cleveland's administration, and the Star U the most pronounced in its support. 13T Those crocodile, fault-finding politi cians whose dissatisfaction occasionally crops tint on account of what they term the president's inactivity or disinterestedness about the appointment of Democrats to of fice, will find a little consolation in the fact that out of 110,000 offices filled by Republi can partisans one year ago last March about two-thirds are to-day filled by Democrats. The good work goes steadily onward and upward. When the 4th day of March, 1S88, shall have paused, every pernicious, offensive Republican officeholder will have heard the crack of his political doom.fam Dealer XZT The rant increasing surplus in the Na-; tionai treasury is niurminir the Kronumn politician..

Not only have they maintained a Democratic majority in the lower house of congress, but they have reduced the majority in the senate so that it will be as much nse to the Democrats as it will be to the Republi cans from a political standpoint. Plain Dealer. 3T All the stuff and nonsense about American ship builders not being able or willing to compete with foreign builders that was published when Secretary Whitney invited foreign proposals is now disproved by the announcement that over seventeen American firms have applied for specifica tions and are about to put in bids. Indeed, the action of Secretary Whitney in throwing open the competition to the world seems to have been both wise and efficacious in stim ulating and promoting the industries and ambition of our ship yards. The indications are that the chief business of legislation in Congress this winter will relate to finance and banking. Dry, of course. But business is business. This Democratic Administration is rapidly pay ing off the public debt. This encroiches upon the bonds held by the national banks as security. The public debt must be paid and the people must have banks. So there you have the problem. It is safe to say that that Administration will not stop paying off the public debt. Therefore it seems that some provision will be made for the banks whereby they can get other bonds. Zanes ville Signal, Eg" Wheeling (W. Va.,) has nearly five miles of brick street pavements, which have been in use three years, and have given entire satisfaction, proving smooth, noiseless and durable. These bricks are wedge shaped, are laid in sand with broad and narrow edges up in alternate rows, hot tar and pitch being poured over them, and sand thrown over all. They make a smooth, noiseless and dnrable roadway. These brick are burned to almost granite hardness by natural gas, and a test of blocks recently made shows that they re sist a pressure of from 14 to 22 tons before breaking. A Committee from the Cleveland City Council left for Wheeling Tuesday, to examine the new paving material, which seems to combine the points of cheapness, excellence and durability. When natural gas reaches Toledo, we may be able to give the brick pavement a trial. Bee. Eg Few people have an adequate notion of our postal service, and a few facts in re gard to the matter may prove valuable. No other nation on earth has one-third as many post offices as the United States. The number of letters mailed during the last year in this country exceeded those mailed in Great Britain by 100,000,000 and nearly as many more as those mailed in Germany, France and Austria combined. The proportion of the number of pieces of mail matter handled last year to the entire population men, women and children was sixty-six in this country, fifty-seven in Great Britain, and nineteen in Germany. On the first of October there were C4,157 post offices in this county; there were 22,747 post-masters appointed, of whom 9,566 were in place of all removals from all causes. For the current year the estimated revenues are $144,000,000, or about equal to the entire receipts of the Government during 1850; the estimated expenditures are $51,000,000 or about equal to the entire expenses of the Government during 1847, the most expensive year of the Mexican war. Let ns look at the growth of the system since the first census in 1790: The seventy five post-offices in the United States have increased to about fifty-four thousand; the one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five miles of mail routes to three hundred and seventy thousand miles; the $37,935 revenue to $44,000,000; the $8,108 for salaries to $11,- 000,000; the $22,081 for the transportation of mails to $23,500,000. All this has been brought about within the iast hundred years; what may we not expect of the next century? If you have tears to shed, prepare to shed them now." The newspapers all over the broad Republic are beginning to say, Christmas comes but once a year." As we have said before in these columns, we will say now, and probably say again sometime in the future "once a year" is often enough too often, if anything, to suit the financial situation of most of us.

In looking upon the map one can readily see the advantages a road of this character would have over other lines. It would not only traverse a country which is almost free from railroad connec tions east and west, but would cross at right angles innumerable important railroad lines, which web the State from north to south. road of this character would not only be a heavy freight route, but its passenger traffic would be immense, sufficient to guarantee that the investment would be a paying one. That Napoleon is in need of snch an outlet none can doubt. The building of a road of this character by a good company would give our town and county a tremendous boom, bringing into notice the advantages of Napo leon and the fertile soil of Henry county. ijet tnose living along tne line or this route tallc the matter up, and who knows but that it may result in the road being built. At Last. On Saturday President Cleveland appoint ed Mr. Geo. L. Johnson, of Toledo, to suc ceed John Kumler as Internal Revenue Col lector for this district. A change has long been looked for by the Democrats, and it was their wish that Kumler be bounced long before this as he should have been. We are convinced he would have been removed or asked to resign months ago, but for the bit ter factional warfare in Lucas connty which has existed in the Democratic ranks. The appointment is an cxeellent one, and the selection of Mr. Johnson reflects much credit npon the Administration and the Democratic organization, of which Mr. John son has been an active and working member for many y'ears. Referring to the appoint ment, the Commercial, of Toledo, a bitter Republican paper, says: "Mr. Johnson is a business man who has made an honorable place for himself by steady and persistent industry and honesty. He is a good man, a self-made man, and will no doubt fill the place of collector, as he has filled other places, creditably and honor ably." Now let President Cleveland make a change in the Customs Collector, by the selection of some good Democrat for the office, and the Democracy of this neck of the woods will rize up and call him blessed. Turn the rascals out, every mother's son of them, and the quicker the better. County Commissioner. The following needs no explanation: In the matter of a probable vacancy in the office of County Commissioner. Whereas, Wm. H. Booher was at the October election A. D., 1883, duly elected County Commissioner of Henry connty, Ohio, for three years from and after the first Monday in December, A. D., 1883, and duly qualified, gave bond and entered npon the performance of the duties of said office and yet continues to discharge the said duties, and Whekeas, the General Assembly of Ohio at its last session changed the term for the County Commissioners elect to enter upon the performance of the duties of said office from the first Monday of December to the first Monday in January, and Wbebeas, some doubt exists as to whether a vacancy will not exist in said office from the first Monday in December, 188G, to the first Monday in January, 1887, and Wbebeas, in order to remove all question for said period last named, now therefor we, D. Meekison, Probate Judge, Thos. W. Dur- bin, County Recorder, and Charles Evers. County Auditor, for said Henry county, do hereby appoint Wm. H. Booher, the present incumbent, to fill said supposed vacancy, he to qualify and give bond according to law. Done this the 4th day of December, A. D., 1886, as witness our hands and seals. D. Meekison, Probate Judge. Thos. W. Dubbin, Recorder. Ceas. Evebs, County Auditor. Immense Hog Trallio. Never before in the history of Henry county has the hog traffic been as heavy as it has been this season, and the pockets of our farmers are enriched thousands of dollars every day from the sales of live and dressed pork. From the little station of Okolona alone some eighty car loads, some of which have been double decks, have been shipped, and are now being shipped at the rate of ten car loads per week. We have this information from the freight agent at Okolona and it can be relied upon a3 correct. One of our prominent citizens remarked the other day that ho would not be surprised if the hog traie of the county would amount to more dollars and cents than the wheat product. That is probably stretching it a little but at any rate it will hug it pretty closely. Again we ask, why go to the far west to raise grain and stock? This county is far superior to any of the western country, and all that is required is for the farmer to apply himself to his vocation, and with the help of the modern machinery for use upon the farm, the soil will bring forth from ten to one hundred fold. Our markets are first class and convenient and all that is raised can be disposed of at good figures. True, the price of produce has been a little low, but our abundant harvests more than make up the difference. We are glad to note that many of those who went to the far west a year or so ago are returning to Little Henry, fully con vinced that the prospects are better here than there. To those already settled here, with a notion to pick up and go west, we would say: remain where you are; devote your energies towards the improvement of your land and stock, and in time yon will be better off than had you gone west to grow np with a new country.

The night was dark and fearful; the lightnings danced across the skies, bounded from cloud to cloud and, with the winds, played havoc with the forest trees; the rolling thunders and the howling storm might indicate "that the very fiends of hell" were enjoying a period of exemption from sulphur ous flames. Above the noise and the clash of the elements arose the dreadful shrieks of the suffering renegade. On a sudden, and as if by Supreme command, the storm clear ed, tde clouds rolled away, the sky was decked with stars and the cries of Girty were hushed. The Indians creeped from their places of concealment and, by an irresistable impulse, flocked to the banks of the river none dared approach the Island. At the West end of the Island where the storm and flood had cleared a apace, stood the fiery skeleton, before him stretched upon the sand, lay the prostrate form of the abandoned wretch. Instead of the spit he held in his hand a triad, the prongs of which were fiery flames. With one of these he touched the nostrils and lips of his victim whose breath instantly ignited and continued to burn and extend until nothing but an ashy shadow remained. The skies again darkened, the thunders again rolled, the lightning was again kindled, and the storm raged. The fiery skeleton picked np the ashy shadow np on his triad and mounting upon the wings of the wind soon disappeared from sight. And, this according to the best Indian authority, was the last of Girty on the earth. Here the old man paused and indicated a dis position to be taken to the shore; this request was complied with and the old man bade us good night, promising that at some future time, should we chance to be at the Island, he might pay us another visit and gratify ns with further naratives of Indian and pioneer adventures on the Maumee.
