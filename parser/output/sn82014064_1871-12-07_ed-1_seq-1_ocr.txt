Instances of the ex-Minister’s Over bearing Officiousness, (Good Prospect for the Passage of a Gen eral Amnesty Bill Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune. SECRETARY FI3U. ■Washington, Dec. 6.—A paper requesting Sec retary Fish to reconsider his determination to rc* tile from the Cabinet was drawn up to-day by .Senator Edmunds and circulated for signature.- in the Senate. Most of the Republicans signed it, beade d by Mr. Wilson. A number of Senators feel -very conlidcnt that Mr. Fish will agree to remain. The secret of this movement in the Senate is the general opposition to Edwirds Piernpont. AKERMAN. The situation concerning Akermau is about tl!i>; The President and several in the Cabinet would be well pleased if he would resign, but of tide-there seems to be little present probability, •'hough he has had several plain hints. * THE CATACAZY CORRESPONDENCE. Theie is much worry to-night in administration quarters over the blunder of Cameron concern ing the Catacazy correspondence. It was intend ed for the present, by the Senate, to hold it solely for executive *esfion. but Cameron allowed it to goon tho table for printing, and before he had waked up to the situation it was out in the Cleik’s office, and in the hands of correspondents of the afternoon press, who were each busy se lecting slices to suit their tastes, aud had ob tained tho gist of the matter, aud several of the important letters, when Cameron came rushing in in a high state of demoralization aud swooped down upon the papers iu hot haste . and bore them off to the executive session. Be foie he had {sufficiently recovered to prevent the publication of that obtained, the substance of the matter had been telegraphed iu all directions. There are in the Catacazy corresx>ondeacc several nstanees given of his attempts to use the press to stir up trouble between the United States aud Eugland. One instance of this is as follows: Some time before the final conclusion of the Ticaty of Washington a long letter ap peared in the World newspaper purporting to give the Emperor’s instructions to Catacazy cou* cerning the Eastern question, and a reported al liance of England and tho U nlted States, and the ouject of the entire letter was to place obstacles in the way of settling the Alabama claims. The day alter this letter appeared in print Catacazy visited the State Department, culled Mr. Fish’s attention to it, and disavowed all responsibility for iu The department subsequently ascertained that it had been furnished to a correspondent of that paper by Catacazy himself; that, after the notes were written, tbe manuscript was at Cata tazy *s request submitted to him for revision. 

CHICAGO RELIEF BILL. Mr. Farwell, of Illinois, introduced a bill providing that, whenever the Secretary of the Treasury shall be satisfied by evidence sub mitted to him, any United States hon£s or securities, or other evidence of government in dcbtedtcj-s have been destroyed iu the Chicago lire, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to issue duplicates ollbueh bonds or securities, taking u bond from the person to whom the issue is made in double the amount of bonds replaced to guard the Tit usury against fraud or mistake. UTAH APPOINTMENT. The appointment to-day of W. B. Irving as Reg- i>tcr of the Land Office in Utah is regarded by the Mormon delegation here as indicating that the administration intends to modify its policy towards polygamy. Maxwell, the former incum bent, and who is now a contestant for Hooper's . scat as Delegate, was active in his persecution of ••the Mounon.®, and was chiefly Instrumental In bringing the late suits against their leaders. &OCATTEES OK TUB OSAGE LANDS. 'Three months ago the War Department warned settlers on the Osage lands, Kansas, to remove. No attention having been paid to this, orders Lave been sent to the military to remove them by iurcc. Senator Pomeroy and the Kansas delega tion are Trying tc have the order revoked, but as yet have met no encouragement. There are about live hundred families settled on these lands. THE MORMON QUESTION promises to become exciting the present session. Senator Cragin has rerived his old bill to punish polygamy, while enabling acts, providing for the admission of Utah as a State into the Union,have been drawn up, and will be introduced in both Houses before the recess. They will provide that from and after the admission of Utah, marriages shall be governed according to the laws of the United States, but that the marriage relations, r.s now existing in that Territory, shall not be disunited. disability bill. The Southern Outrage Committee met this morning and adopted a resolution -offered by Mr. .Stevenson, providing for the removal of all dis abilities under the Fourteenth Amendment, and lor the extension of the power of the President to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and to hold all Ku-Klux responsible civilly aud criminally tor the acts of each other. Senator Robertson to-day called up his old bill to remove disabilities, which he advocated with so much persistency and so lit . lie success last session. The bill in question was introduced by Mr. Hale, of Maine,lastspring, and originally provided for the removal of all disabilities imposed by tbe FilteenthAmendment. it was subsequently amended by Judge Poland, so as to exclude from its operations members of 'Congress and officers of the army and navy above the age of 21 years, who withdrew to aid the re bellion, and members of State conventions which adopted ordinances of secession. In this state the bill went to the Senate and was persistently last session by the South Caro lina Senators. Its consideration was affected to day by the usual Senate rules, wh’eh prohibits all bills from being taken up within six days alter the commencement of the session. Mr. Robert son gave notice that ho would again call up the ■jill next Monday. It willnotpass in its present shape, but amendments have been prepared to strike out Mr. Poland's ■ amendments, and to leave the bill as originally introduced by Mr. Hale, aud of the President's sug gestions that there was noadvantage or propriety m excluding men from office merely because be fore tbe war they had character and standing sufficient to acquire prominence. Many adminis trative Senators who have heretofore opposed this measure will now support it.

STATE LEGIF Commendable 7 '< C~T Spring!} The mayor’s Bill Considered in the House and Recommitted. Cook County Apportionment— A New Deal. Messages of the Governors of Virginia and Kentucky. Special Despatch to Tho Chicago Tribune. MUNICIPAL REFORM DILL. Springfield, Doc. C.—Tho attempt this morn ing to pass the bill extending powers of Slayers of cities of the first-class was unsuccessful, but It was not unwise. Had tho bill been defeated, nothing would have been lost, since tho Senate bill on the same subject is also on Its third read ing and can .be passed there at any time. For several days members have suggested that it was inadvisable to proceed with this necessary meas ure, since the 'Governor would veto it, and have used this as a reason to cover their own indiffer ence ; but It is not tho habit of tho Governor to veto bills in advance though he may suggest modifications which will make them conform more closely to constitution al requirements. In this case certain sugges tions were made, some of which now appear to be unimportant, but tbcrc was at no time a promise that the hill would be vetoed, and since tbo same bill was in both houses His Excellency could rea sonably soo no objection to pushing it forward in whatever form it might bo. It was taken up with but little opposition, and It was not injured by Mr. Mcrn’t’s remarks, and it would have been better hud Mv. King made no reply and let that be made by Mr. Springer, ir by any one; for active opposition is limited to two or three people. But King’s remarks started others, ami Cook County, which had not expected tho hill was coming up, became animated. Mr. Campbell expressed his doubts as to the effects of the bill ou tho West Side Park Commissioners, and Burlev was also concerned as to tho language of tho bill, which bad been before the {House and members from Cook County for nearly throe weeks. The moment that outiidora saw that Cook County hud not agreed, ami that ou this, as on many other questions, it failed to bo a unit, they became indifferent and did not care where the bill went. While there is no doubt as to the desire of Cook . County members to get this needed legislation, ii is unfortunate that tho apparent indifference of some, apparent fears of others, and unwise re marks of many should so obstruct the bill. For a member from Chicago to leave tho House when it stems likely that a vote is to be taken in a mo ment, is great negligence, making some think that in reality he opposes tho im asuro. For u member from Chicago to xell other - 'embers that he has £rreat confidence in the present Mayor, but is not certain as to tho wisdom of granting those powers to succeeding Mayors, is to do the bill more injury than his open opposition would occasion. These powers are wanted for t\U time, and it is wrong to givo mem bers the impression that they are needed but for a moment. It is hard to say when this bill will come up again, for apportionment and revenue may crowd it out of eight, but oue thing is cer tain, nearly the whole House is desirous of giving Chicago the legislation it needed. Democrats and Republicans, northern and southern mem bers united on that point, aud tho representa tives from Joflerou will go as for as the oue from Jo Daviess ; but if members from Cook County get into a wrangle on this subject the House will very naturally get disgusted, and come to the conclu sion that the people of Cook County no more know what they want than their Representatives do. Again, to defeat any one Tull ou this subject is to pretty inevitably defeat all the others. It will intensify discord aud further disgust the House. 

COOK COUNTY AI’I’OIITIOJOIEST. Dissatisfaction witlj the apportionment of Cook County bus been steadily growing, especially among tbe West Side members, the majority of whom are opposed to it, since they behove that nearly the entire West Side is handed over to the Democracy or to some other section, and whether the feeling la right or wrong they are greatly in fluenced thereby. The North Side members aro not so personally concerned, and have not us yet taken any part in the matter. When the bill comes up tomorrow on effort will bo made to have the consideration of the Cook County Districts postponed till the rest ot the bill is gone through with. At present the appor tioniueul in the bill seems rather most likely to succeed. Cook County members cannot all agree on any plan, and the House will have to settle the mutter. 

SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. That part of Mayor MediU’e message relative to special assessments was read here with great interest by city and country members. Those who object to the principle of assessing benefits seem to have gained in spirit and numbers since the special session, and are confident that they have a majority in the House. This is doubtful, butfhev have certainly gained. FEES AND SALARIES. The House Committee on Fees and Salaries to day reported back Mr. Sprague’s bill giving cents i>er hundred words for rc-recording deeds, Ac.,in Cook County. Hut Mr.Woodard's bill,which allows live cents for recording or re recording will have the preference. 1111.1.S REPORTED rack. Tills morning the Senate Committee reported back a great number of bills, most of which were laid on the table. They have cleared their files ahd got rid of many bills which were simply in troduced by members to please constituents, or which those who offered them have since aban doned. OBJECTION TO TUB MAYOR’S RILL. Thero are suggestions of the advisability of put- , ting an amendment to the bill iucreajing the powers of a Mayor, which shall allow him to re move only with consent of the Council—he to suspend an officer and report to the Council, which shall act at the first regular meeting. Mr. Campbell believes the bill, as it stands, gives tbc Mayor power to remove West Side Park com missioners, and makes the entire city liable for the park debt, aud a lawyer of some note, who, however, believes the bill unconstitutional, and is opposed to it, agrees with him as to the first point, that these Commissioners never have been eity officers. They are officers of West Chicago, and the debt is a lien only on the property m West Chicago. They are organized under the not, one section of which amends tbo charter of Cm cii"o, but the rest of which has nothing to do with the city charter, and simply creates an Independ ent municipality. TUB APPORTIONMENT QUESTION. At a meeting of the Cook County delegation, held this evening, a lively discussion took place on the apportionment of the county, Thoplan adopted some time ago was thrown overboard, and the following substituted by a vote of 10 to y, fourrorllvo present not voting: - First District First, Second, Third, and Fourth Second District—Fifth and Sixth Wards, and the towns of Bremen, Lake. Bloom, Calumet, Rich, Orland, Hyde Park, Worth, Thornton. Third Distrlct tlie towns of Palos. Leraont, Lyons, Cicero, Pro, viso, Leyden, Jefferson, Lake Uiew, Evanston Niles, Maine, Elk Grove, Schamborg, Hanover. Barrington, Palatine, Wheeling, Northtlem New Trier, and the Seventh Ward. I mirth Dis trict, Eighth, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Wards. Fifth District. Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Wards. Sixth District, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Eighteenth Wards. Seventh District, Six teenth, Seventeenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Wards. Much dissatisfaction is expressed by the opponents ot the plan adopted by the majority of to-nigbt, and ns thoieis no likelihood of the delegation agreeing to support any plan, the dif ferences wifi probably have to be settled by the House.

Mr. MORRISON, of Cook, moved to have tho bill to increase tho powers of Mayor of Chicago put on its passage. The rules were suspended, and the bill read a third time. Mr. MERRITT opposed the bill, sinep it gave so much power to the Mayor. All people respected tho present incumbent, but there was no assur ance that ho would remain iu power. The people of Chicago had not been consulted as to whether they wanted the change in the charter. This bill was delegat ing an unlimited power. Had the. Cook County representatives been elected ou that issue, ho would have supported their bill, but as it was ho could not. Mr. 

KING, of Cook, replied showing tho evils of the present system. A policeman even could not be finally dismissed except by action of the court. It was tho almost unanimous opinion of the peo ple of Chicago that tho bill shall pass. The bill gave the Mayor much power, but it was felt ne cessary that ho should have it.

SPRINGER supported tho bill and its prin ciple, which-was the oneoxerclscd by General Juekcon when ho turned ou incompetent office holders. . Mr. CAMPBELL said ho intended to have made an amendment. Ho thought it defective in one particular. The W’est Side Park Commissioners would be under the control of the Mayor if the bill passed as It was. Mr. MORRISON wanted to know what harm it was. ... Mr. CAMPBELL said if thccitytook charge of the West Side Park the city would have to assume the entire indebtedness ol tho park, taking it ofl' of West Chicago. Mr. KING wanted to know if park officers were city officers. Mr. CAMPBELL said not, but thought the bill would cover them, the W’est Side Park bill being an amendment to tho city charter. The North and South Side Parks would not bo touched. To pass the bill was to juit the West Park indebted ness ou all Chicago. Mr. BURLEY did not think the first section was drawn exactly as it should have been to a> coinplisli the desired object. It did not give tho power desired for tho removal of policemen. Xliat there* must be accountability to sonic* one was manifest. Ho commended the section allow ins the Mayor to veto a part ot an appropriation bill.

Richmond, Va., Dec. 6.— The Legislating or ganized to-day. Governor Walker’s message speaks of universal suffrage aud equal rights be loro tho law as having proved conducive to good, aud to tin* stable rebuilding of the government. Under It Virginia has enjoyed a degree of peace, good order, and obedience to law excelled by none of sister States. Ho favors immigration; recommeuds an equaliza tion of taxation; eulogizes the school system which is successful beyond thooxoectu lious of its warmest friends, and approves the system for fuudiug the debt adopted by the lust legislature. lie recommends an amendment to tho constitu tion for holding all State elections ou the same day every two years, cud ou a different day from Federal elections. This change is regarded as necessary in consequence of the passage of an act by Congress which under the guise of regulat ing the election of Congressmen seeks to control the affairs of tlie State. The Governor recapitulates tho arbitrary acts of Congress and tho President, and denounces their encroachments «u the rights of people and Btates, particularly South Carolina, lie says: ‘•We have passed a terrible ordeal of attempted secession, hut the recoil has carried to tho other extreme, and tho dangers 'which menaced the nation in IsCl are limliug a parallel In IS7I. Let the people demand that tho inviolability of habeas corpus the subordination of military to civil authority; the inviolacy of the public faith, State and>a tional; untarnished honesty in tho administra tion of public affairs; the purilicatiou and reduc tion of tariff'd and taxation to tlio lowest degree consistent with the maintenance of the public credit; free education for all; a fostering care, encouragement, and elevation of labor, and a universal and impartial suffrage. Not until the people rise in their majesty and reasseit their liberties now trampled on: not until kindness has superseded hate; not un til patriotism has superseded partl7.au selfish ness inayl wo look for tho inauguration, of an era of good feeling. The Governor concludes with the hope that all good men throughout the laud, regardless of past associations, will unite in an honest and earnest effort to redeem tho nation. 

KENTUCKY. ladfisvili.E. Ky. f Dec. G.—The Govornorin his message to the Legislature Is very severe on law lessness. He says the mob la no remedy for any thing. If the mob Inliict death on any one, all who countenance the act are guilty of murder, lie recommends additional legislation to more certainly reach the unlawful organiza tions nnd evil-disposed persons, imposing more stringent and severe penalties on public officials for failure or neglect to enforce the criminal laws. He says “ I am profoundly impressed with tin* urgent necessity forsomething being done to eflectually cheek arid break up tho dl.-orders. The unwarranted interference of the Federal authorities in local affairs has provoked and aggravated much of the lawlessness existing among us.” He recommends the passing of acts admitting negroes as witnesses iu courts on tao same fool ing as other citizens; also an net admitting as parlies to aetion all interested in tho issue as competent witnesses. He recommends that tho revenue collected from colored people, after pay -smr the expenses of collection, be >ot apart exclu sively for the education of the colored children. NIAGARA SHIP CANAL. The BufTnlo Board of Trade Conclude** not to Carry Oat the Scheme. Bitfai.o, Dee. s.—At a full meeting of tho Board of Trade, hold this morning, the special committee to whom had been referred tho subject of the proposed Commercial Convention to be held at Detroit on the 23th Inst., submitted a lengthy and interesting report, accompanied by a series of resolutions, which were unanimously adopted. Tho report denounces tho proposed Niagara ship canal as useless and unnecessary* and com ’ pleted would not tend to lesson the cost of trans portation or cheapen the price of Western products to Eastern consumers. It protests against a Congressional appropriation for tlio proposed subject in the present state of the national finances, and bo cause it would add greatly to tho commercial in terest of a foreign nation at the expense of our own. It declares tho Eno Canal to bo capable of filling all present requirements of commerce, and that it Is the cheapest, shortest, safest, ami most direct outlet for Western commerce to the Eastern States ox* Europe. It recommends the improving and cheapening of transportation on the Erie Canal, so us to make it as near a froo channel as superintendence and top.iirs admit, viewing tho proposed canal scheme as antagon istic to National and State interests, and savor in'" strongly of foreign influence. . The Board of Trade respectfully decline sending delegates to the Detroit convention.

B. Wright, the architect, published lu The Tribune this morning, ho remarks, ■with refer* encc to iron columns, as follows : The effect upon Iron columns wns most lamenta ble. In the so-called tlro-proof buildings, the damage was. in almost every case, caused by the giving way of tho cast-iron columns, which seemed to yield very readily. The heat was so intense In many buildings as to melt off the ends of the columns, and many of the east-iron columns wore bent to a considerable angle, having been softened only, while most wore broken like China pitchers. Tholossof tho Post Office build ing ns due to the giving way of iron columns in tho first story, upon which were heavy wrought irou gird ers ami brick partition walls. Mr. Mullett, the supervising architect of the United States Treasury Department, in his re report, also attributes tho loss of the Post Cilice to the giving way of tho Iron columns in tho first stcry, which supported heavy brick walls above, but ho adds that this would not have occnrredlf the columns had been fitc-proor. lie does not, of course, stop to explain Imw an iron column can bo made fire-proof; and, from the remarks of Mr. Wright, above quoted, th o ordinary reader would get the idea that a fire-proof iron column was an impossibility, and the suggestion of one an ab -BUOnc of the building laws of the city of Now York.however, requires that whenever walls- aro supported upon columns, such columns shall bo mane fire-proof, in accordance with the patent of Mr. J.B.Corncll. This provides that tho column which supports the weight’shall ho surrounded with oucenoughlargerin dlometcrto leaven space allarnnndtlie inner column or sayacouple of Inch es. This is then filled with cement. Tho Inner column is of course made perfectly plain, while any desired ornamentation can ho applied to tho outer one. In llio case of a severe lire the outer column may have its beauty destroyed, Imfc as it- sustains no weight. it never lulls to perform its function of maintaining the coating of cement around tlio in ner one, tints preserving it. I am, respectfully, Aldan C. Shreds.

Gold lower than at Any Time Since Jane, 1862. Special Despatch to Tho Chicago Tribune. MONET. New York, Deo. G.—The features of tho mar kets to-day were tho decline in gold, and the ac tivity and high rates in money. Gold touched 109 3-4, the lowestpointsince July 6,1862. The open ing price was 109 7-8. Tho market was heavy throujhout the day, and at the close tho quota tion was 109 3-4. The rates paid for carrying were 6, 5, 4,3, and 7 per cent. Tlie heaviness was due largely to sales of • gold by parties long of - stocks who borrowed the gold and sold it to realize cur rency ns the easiest way of supplying their monetary requirements. Tlie Gold Room present ed a busy appearance. Congressional schemes of finance were generally discussed. It Is said there is much feeling at present in favor of the govern ment receiving a portion of tho custom duties in legal-tender notes. The money market was very active. Stockbro kers were paying from 7 to 9 per cent, gold, anil with leading government bond dealers the rate was 7 per cent currency. It is evident that in ad dition to the national or ordinary influences at this season of the year . in favor of active money a clique of stock speculators are doing their best to make the market stringent. It is estimated that they have locked up from four to live million*, and their friends give out that they contemplate locking up that much more, their purpose being to break tho stock market preparatory to buying for a grand bull campaign iu the early part of tho new year. Currency is still going South for cot ton, and to the West and Southwest for pork. 

FOREIGN EXCHANGE was weak, the quotation being 109 for prime sixty days* bankers' sterling. GOVERNMENT BONDS were lower, in sympathy with gold, but closed firm. The Assistant Treasurer offered proposals for the sale to the government of $1,000,000 of 5-2fs. The entire amount offered was $813,980, and tho awards wero $517,430, at 109 74-100 to 109 87-100. The Treasury paid out $1,200,000 gold in redemption of 5-20 bonds. It is expected that the Secretary wilj, within a few days, call for the 60- pcrccnt gol£ subscriptions, made by or through the National Banks to tho new C per cent loan, intimations to this effect having been given from Washington. This is to be fol lowed some timeTduring the mouth by a call for the remaining 40 per cent. The amount of cash subscriptions iu this country is estimated at abou $15,0c0,G00. The Treasury is in possession of the exact amount, bnt has never made it public. Central Pacific bonds closed at 1031-2 to 103 3-8, and Unions at 911-4 to 911-2 for firsts; 79 to 79 1-8 for land grants; blto 811-4 for iummea; and 261-2 to 26 5-8 for stock. HIE STOCK MARKET was generally heavy. Speculators in Western Union are disappointed that Congressmen are not looking with favor on the President’s pro posal for the purchase of the telegraphs by the government. Tho expectation was that Western Union would advance to 75 on the recommenda- lions iu the President’s message and Postmaster General's report. The dozing quotation to-day ■was 08 1-4UCB a 8. - 

UUEADSTUFFS. Flour was iu -light demand for the low and mediumFgrades. Family grades were in moder ate request, but firm. Good No. 2 and superfine were steady with a fair Inquiry. Tho wheat market was unsettled and tame. Shippers held ofl', and prices, iu the absence of much business, were nominal. The receipts,however, were limit ed and holders were firm. Freight room Is aearce. Corn was in fair demand, chiefly for export, and was Arm at the close. New was more active and in belter supply. [To tho Associated Proas.] THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

The following ollicial letter explains the posi tion of the‘Western Union Telegraph Company In relation to the postal telegraph scheme; NKW YOBK, Dec. C. Jfcit. JiuHf* n. neck, .V, Wdiihiiujton : You are reported in the morning papers as having staled in the House yesterday Unit the Western Union company had opposed the assumption o£ the telegraph ov tiio government before the last Congress. You understood it to have changed its position, and to ho now anxious for It. Permit me to assure you that you have been misinformed. The Western Union Telegraph Company is inflexibly opposed to any inter, fcmice of the government with their business. A meeting of the Board of Directors was held this morning, which was largely attended, and a resolution was unanlmoflsly passed protesting against the right and poller ot any acqni sition of their property and rights by the government. A committee, consisting of Horace b. Clark, A. B. Coi uell, Edwin D. Morgan, and myself, were appoint ed to prepare and send to Washington a protest against the suggested action ot the government, and to claim its protection against the policy of thcestab lisliroeut by the government of competitive enter prises.

The letter of Mr. Fish to Minister Curtin, dated November 1C last, states that on his arrival in Washington, Catacazy gave promise of being a useful and very acceptable minister, ana made an agreeable impression. Soon, however, ho hc rran to make himself very officious, interfering in questions not appropriately connected •with his legation, and in those pending before Congress, importuning Senators and Representatives, and resorting to personal interviews and solicitations unusual on the part of representatives of other powers ac creoited to this government, distasteful to the legiolatora thus indecorously approached, and. tendingto embarrass the free course of legislation on subjects with respect to which his interference was obtruded. He did not hesitate to use the newspapers of the country to influence public opinion upon questions pending before tbo government and indulged m much license in his denunciation of measures and individuals. In his conversation ho was even more severe and unrestrained, and emmoyea abusive and vituperative language toward very many persons, including several hi public posi tions and enjoying the respect and confidence of the conmuinitv. The impropriety of a Foreign Ministerial* sitterapting to influence and misdi rect the public opinion of a country must be ad mitted as sufficient ground for his ceasing to ho a proper ugent between the government which he repres ents and that to which he is accredited. Thocor respondence contains proofs showing the trutnof the statements of the Secretary andothermatteis of public interest. ” .
