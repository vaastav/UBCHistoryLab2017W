Monday's specials from Wash ington indicates that the opposi tion to the re-election of Bailey as Democratic leader in the next Con gress is dying out. Representative Cousins of Iowa introduced the first bill in Congress Monday. It is a bill de claring the standard of value in the United States to be the gold dollar of 25 8-10 grains of standard gold and 900 fine. If this bill is ever heard from again the wool will fly. One hundred girls, inmates of the Cleveland Ov hau Home at Versailles, Ky., and the matron and music teacher, are very sick from poison. Some of the children will die. They are supposed to have been poisoned by drinking water that had been standing in lead pipes. Durino the closing days of the last session of Congress Senator Morgan gave notice of his inten' tion to call up the Nicaragua cana! bill at the beginning of the present session. He unquestionably wil redeem his promise and doubtless will seek the first opportunity. Al the indications are that this ques tion will be one of the most im portant sabjecis under considera tion during the session. In his report to Congress Comp troller Dawes sa,-s that, though a less number of national banks are operating than at" any time since 1890, the individual loans, dis counts and deposits and total re sources are larger than evr be fore. Yes, there is lots of money in the banks, but the stuff the people have to sell commands such miserably low prices they scarcely eke out a scant living. Plenty of money in the banks doesn't seem to help the producers. They are growing poorer each year. There is bound to be something radically wrong when such a fact exists. Extra Session of Creek Council. Muskogee, Dec. 5. Isparhecher, the chief of the Creek nation, has called an extra session of the council of that nation for the 12th inst. to consider holding a new election as to whether or not the Indians of that tribe desire to treat with the United States. It will be remembered that these In dians by popular vote on the 1st of November rejected the treaty they made with the Dawes com mission last year and the Curtis bill immediately became operative oyer them. Now they are anxious to treat'.

RESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Congress convened Monday, and President McKinley sent in his annual message.wbich dealt almost exclusively" with our war with Spain and other foreign matters. He compliments Dewey and Samp son, but ignores Schley and Roose velt. He I is in ; favor of building the Nicaraugua canal and of build ing up ie 'American merchant marine. The follo-ving is the Presidei i position on the finan cial eoncuuon of the country: THE 

INFLOW OF GOLD. The provision made for strength ening the resources of the treasury in connection with the war has given increased confidence in the purpose and power of the govern ment to maintain the present standard, and has established more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. A marked evidence of this is found in the in flow of gold to the treasury. Its net gold holdings on November 1, 1897, were $239,883.16, as com pared with $1.)8, 573,147 on Novem ber 1, 1898, and an increase of net cash of $207,7.36,100, November 1, 1897, to $.K),2:J8,273, November 1, 1898. The present ratio of . net treasury gold outstanding govern ment liabilities, including United States treasury notes of 1890, silver certificates, currency certificates, standard silver dollars and frac tional silver coin, November 1, 1898, was 23 23 ier cent, as com pared with 19.96 per cent Novem ber 1, 1897. 

DEATH TO GREENBACKS. I renew so much of my recom mendation of December, 1897, as follows: That when any of the United States notes are presented for re demption and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart aud only paid out in ex change for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States notes prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from the government a note without paying gold for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an issue' bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes a non - interest bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other way the3' may return again, to be followed bv another interest bearing debt to redeem a non interest bearing debt. This recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree the safety of the present standard and protect our currency from evils to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the general business condition in the country. In my judgment the present con ditions of the country justify the enactment of the legislation recom mended one year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund, from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. It is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency is not required. On the contrary, there is an obvious reason for it.
