The President's message to Congress opens as follows: "The assemblage within the nations legislative halls of those charged with the (lilt? of milking laws for tbe bcne6t cf a generous nnd free people impressively suggests the exacting obligation and inexorable responsibility involved in thiir task. At the threshold of such tabor now to be undertaken by the Congress of the 1'uited States and in the direbnrge of an ixccutive duty enjorned by tie Constitution I sub mit tb's communication containing; a btufataUtr.ent of tbe condition of our nationul a flairs and rccomnieuding such legitlation ns seems to me necessary and ixpcdicnt." Korelun Ifcliitloim. The President first treats o' our off fairs with foreign counties, passing in rapid tcviewotir relation. all fricndlvand of no especial interest, with Brazil, Port ugal. Chili, China, Japan, Germany, England and Hawaii. Of the latter he says: "Since communicating the volumnous coirespnndence in regard to Hawaii and the action taken by the Senate ami House ol Representatives on certin questions submitted to the judgment uud wider discretion of Congress, the organization of a government ill place ol the provisional arrangement which 'ollowrd thr deposition ol the (Ju'.en bas been announced with evidence ol its elTtc'ive operation. The recognition usual in such ca-ts has been accorded the new government." riiuiiu'i's. The President tukes the following figures from Secretary Carlisle's report: "The secretary ol the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources ol revenue during the fisral year ending I tine 30. 1ND4, amounted to 'X'l 802,468.20 nnd it expenditures to $412.tili5. 758.87, leaving n dificit of $(i'J .803 1'GO 58 There was n decrease ol $15 U51i.G74-liG in the ordinary tx- pcnsis ul the government as compared ships Paris or New York of the interna tional navigation company or any other ship of our reserve navv. Public I-amta. It is estimated that the pu'il:c domain still remaining amounts to a little more than 600.000,000 acres, excluding, how ever, about 3G0.0O0.000 acrts in Alaska as well as military reservations and railroad and other sections of land as yet unadjurjicated. 1'enHloun. At the close ol tbe last fiscal year, on the 30th day ol June, 1894. there were 909,544 persons on our pension rolls, being a net increase of 3,532, over tbe number reported at the end of the pre vious year. Tbe total amount expended for pensions during the vear was $139, 804 461, leaving an unexpended balance from the sum appropriated of $25,205, 712. Tbe sum necessary to meet pension exnennitures for lie yeannding June 30, 1896, is estimated at $140,000,000. The commissioner of pensions is of the opinion that tbe year 1895 being the thirtieth after the close ot the war of the rebellion, must, according to all sensible human calculations, see the highest limit ol the pension roll and that alter that year it must begin to decline. I'ouhIou Frauds. The barefaced and extensive pension frauds exposed under the direction of tbe courageous and generous veteran soldier now at the head of the bureau leave no room for the claim that no purging of our pension rolls was needed, or that continued vigilance and prompt action are not necessary to the same end. The accusation that an effort to detect pen sion Irauds is evidence ol unfriendliness towards our worthy veterans and a de nial of their claims to the generosity of the government, suggests an unfortunate indifference to the commission of any offense which has for its motive the securing of a pension and indicates a willingness to be blind to tbe existence ol mean aim treacherous crimes which plav upon demagogic fears and make sport of the patriotic impulse ot a grate ful people. Democratic Saving. The Secretary of Agriculture reports n saving in expenditures during tbe yearot $600,000, which is converted back into the treasury. This sum is 23 per cent, of the entire appropriation, turn, Not Wheat. There was lulling ul in A nitric in wheat exports ol 13,500,000 bushels, and the secretary is inclined to believe that wheat may not in the future be the staple ex port cereal product of our country, but that corn will continue to advance in importance as an export on account ot the new uses to whien it is constantly Holiday Goods, will have a limited quantity, but may e" u with the fisiul (.1 WSi.

A I'nrinor'H C'eiiHiiH. It is deemed possible that an agricult ural census may be taken each oar through the rgents of the statistical division of tbe department. Such a course is commended for trial by the chief of that division. Its scope would be: 1st, the area under each ol the more important corps; 2d, the aggregate pro duction of each of such corps; 3d, the quantity of wheat and corn in the bands ol the farmers at a date after the spring sowings and plantings and before the beginning of harvest, and also the quan tity of cotton and tobacco remaining in the hands of planters cither at tbe same time or at some other designated lime. The cost of tbe work is estimated at $500,000. Civil krvU'i Hi-lorm. The advantages on the public service of an adherence to the principles ot civil service reform are constantly more np , patent, and nothing is so encouraging to those in official life as the increasing .... . . . ,A Vi oi tue government to mc:i ,ftv" - It would have been well i, m this emer gency authority bad existed to issu. the bonds of tbe government bearing a low rate ot interest and maturing within a short period, but the Congress having failed to confer such authority, resort was necessarily bad to the resumption act of 1885, and pursuant to its provi sions bonds were issued drawing interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum and maturing 10 yeurs after their issue, that being the shortest time authorized by the act. I am glad to sav, however, that on the sale of these bonds the ptemium received operated to reduce the rate of interest to he paid by the government to less than three per cent. Iluil l' liiiimt'. Nothing could be worse or further re moved from sensible finance than the relations existing between the currency the government has issued, the gold held for its redemption and the means which must be resorted to lor the purpose ol replenishiug such redemption fund when imoatred. liven it the claims upon this fund were confined to the obligations originally intended and if the redemption of these obligations meant tbeir cancella tion the lund would be very smnll; but these obligations when received and re deemed in dollars are not cancelled but are reissued and may do duty many times by way of drawing gold from the treas ury. Thus we have an endless chain in operatiou constantly depicting the treas ury's gold and never uenr a final rest. As il this was not bad enough, we have, bv a statutory declaration that it is the policv ot the government to maintain the parity betweeu gold uud silver, aided the force and momentum of this exhausting process and added largely to tbe currency obligations. Our email gold irescrve is subject to drain Irom every side. The dcniunds that increase our danger also increase the necessity of protecting their reservengaiust depletion and it is most unsatisfactory to know that the protection atT Tiled is only a temporary palliation. Iteffcctually shows that only way under present conditions there can be replenishment is through issue nnd sale ol the bonds of the gov ernment lor gold, and yet Congress hus not only thus far declined to authorize the issue of bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there seems a disposition in some quarters to deny both the ne cessity and the power lor the issue ol bonds at all. ApilllHt II MlVl l' llllnls I cauu t lor u moment In l i ve that anv of our citiz.-ns arc deliberately will ing that their government should de fault in its pecuniary obligations or that its financial operations should he reduced to a silver basis. At any rate I should not feci that niv dutv was done if I omitted anv tlTort I could m ike to avert such a calamity. As long, therefore, as no provision is made tor the Iinal re demption or the putting uside ot the cur rency obligation now used to rcpeatedlv and constantly draw from the govern ment its gold, und a:: long as no b.tter authority lor bond issues is allowed than at present, just such authority will be utilized whenever and as often as be comes necessary to maintain a sufficient gold reserve am' in abundant tune to save the credit ot our country. Our Currency Not Elimtlc, Ourstions relative to our banks and the currency ore closely connected with the subject just referred to nnd they also present some unsatisfactory features. Prominent among them arc the lack ol elasticity in our currency circulation and its frequent $444,427,748.45 resulting in a deficit of I appreciation by our people of its ad- C

On the first dnv of November, 189, the total stock ol money of nil kinds in the country was $2,240,773.8S, as agu nst $2,204,651,000 on the first dav ol November, 1803, and tbe monev of all kinds in circulation wns $1 G72.093, 422 or $24.27 per capita upon an esti mated population ol 08.887,000. It is estimated that on the first day of July, 1894, the stock of metallic money in the United States, consisting of coin and buPion, amounted to $1,250,640, 958 of which $027 923 201 wus gold and $624,347,757 wn silver. '1 lie National Hanks. The total number of National banks in existence on tbe 31st day of October, 1894, was 3,756, being 40 less than on tbe 31st dav ol October. 1893. The capital stock paid in was $672,671,365, being $9,678,491 less tban at tbe same time in tbe previous yeur, and the sur plus lund and undivided pronts, less ex penses nnd tuxes paid, amounted to $334,121,082 10. which wns $16,089,- 780 less than on October 31st, 1893 Tho Army. While the maximum legal strength of the army is 25,000 men, the effective strength through various causes, is but little over 20,000 men. No considerable increase in the army is, in my judgment, demanded bv recent events. War Department Expenses, The total expenditures for the war de partment for the year ended June 30, 1894, amounted to $56,039,009.34. 01 this sum $25,37 1,555.96 was for public works. This latter sum inrludes $19, 494,047 49 lr river and harbor improve ments and $3,947,813.56 for defenses. State Mllltln. Tbe total enrollment of the militia ,of the several states is 117,533, officers and enliitcd men, an increase of S343 over tbe number reported at tbe close of tbe previous year. Tbe reports of military inspection! by regular ormy officers show a marked increase in interest and efficiency among the State organisations, and I strongly recommend a continuance ol the policy of affording every practical encouragement possible to this auxiliary of our military establishment. Tbe Supremo Court. The report ol the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the Supreme Court in overcoming tbe arrears ol its business and in reaching a condition in which it will be able to dis pose of cases as tbey arise without any unreasonable delay.
