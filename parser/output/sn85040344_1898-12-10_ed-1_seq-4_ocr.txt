Executive bays Wc Must Await Sign ins of Treaty Before Dis cussion Begins. Washington, I*. C., Pee. s.—President McKinley’s second annual message, sub mitted to f'ongress today contains about 20.000 words. Following are the more inqiortant features of the message. To the Senate and House of Ilepres. n tatives: Notwithstanding the added bur dens rendered necessary by the war. our people rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily-increasing degree of prosperity, evidenced by the largest volume of busi ness ever recorded. Manufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present Congress has inert used the treasury’s re ceipts to the amount estimated by it authors; the finames of the government have been successfully administer'd and its credit advanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the na tional spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds be tween every section of the country. In reviewing the contmvei >y which led up to the war with Spain, the President takes up the thread of narrative where it terminated in his !a-t message. He con cluded: "It was hones.ly du** to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to which she had become Irrevocably com mitted." It became evident, however, that the proposed jilans were barren of good re sults. No tangible relief was afforded the reconcentrades. among whom the rate of mortality frightfully increased, the prof fered expedient of tunes of cultivation proved illusory and it was apparent that nothing save the physical exhaustion of Spain or the Ilubans and the pur ties! min of the island of t üba could result from the struggle then in pro^re-s. Destruction of the Mairtc. At this critical juncture, the destruc tion of the battleship Maine occurred. Concerning it the President said; "It is a striking evidence of the poise am! sturtly g 1 nse dist aguish tg■ urn tion.il i-haraeter that this sho king blow. falling upon a generous pie, already deeply touched by preceding events in <’uba, did not move them to an instant, kesperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of an end of danger and di order at our doors that made possibh such a deed, by whomsoever wrought.'’ Ilesuming the war narrative, the Presi dent directs attention to th< measures, including tin soOJXhmsm) ilppropriati'iu for national defense, taken to place th country on a war footing, and adds: "It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war. when it did come, found oar nation not unprepared to meet the conflict.” ’ Reference is made to the apprehension of coming strife by the continental pow - ers, voiced in the address to the Pr-M dent through their nnilias=adoi-5 and en voys. and to the Presiiient's rt-lily ihere i ■. Still unimatod. however, by the ho >.■ of a peaceful solution of the dirfietilty and obeying the dictates of duty, the Presi dent relaxed no effort to bring about a spC'ily ending of the Cuban struggle. Negotiations with the Madrid government proved futile so far as practical results were concerned, and then it was that tie' President presented the question to Congress, saying: “In the name of humanity, in the name i civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests which give ns the right and duty to speak, and to act. th war in Cuba must stop," The result of this statement of the ca-. was the adoption of the memorable join! resolution by Congress, declaring the pur pose of the United States to intervem between the Spaniards and Cubans. Following swiftly upon the enactment af the resolution came the severance of diplomatic relations between the two ■■■mntrb-s, the proclamation of a blockade of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers, and the formal declaration of the exist ence of a state of war. All other govern meats were immediately notified of the existence of war and each proclaimed neutrality. "It is not among the least gratifying :i cideuts of the strugg ■ that the obliga tions of neutrality were impartially dis charged by all. often under delicate and difficult circumstances, - ’ remarks the President. Critical Review of the War. The President reviews at length the work of preparation f >r war, referring particularly to the enlistment of the vol unteers, to the material increase of the navy in both men and ships an ! to the precautionary measures taken for the pro tection of the <a>>nboard coast and i itie>. ‘The aggregate humbe ■ of mines plac'd was lo.'gj. at the principal barbers from Maine to t ’alifnrnia." Referring to "the dith tilt and imj rant character" of the work performed by the signal corps, the President. say<; "This serviet was invaluabh to the exectnivi in Invi ting the operations of the army and navy. With a total force of over BJftO the oss was by diseast. in ian ; tic Id. officers and ncn included, only five." A- to the authorized loan of ?200.0<>0.- ( NMt. which was taken entirely by -ran!! bidders, the President says; “This v. - ~ most on ouraging and signifb aut res t. showing the vast resources of die nation uni the determination o' the people to n* injld their country's honor." Taking np ehronoJogii ally tin •x• nts- .t he war. the President r< views • n in can fully. The first encounter was the sat Matai :as on Apri 27. This was followed by an engagement which was "dost nd to mark amt mi raMe ep maritime warfare." This was I'tinupo dore Dewey’s - ry a? Mat ila mi May 1. "The < n this remarkable victory.” ,„y< t ! -e President, "upon the spirit ot our j pie ami on the fortunes of war was in stant.

I he President bears testimony and pays fitting tribute “to trie patriotism and devo tion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to he- ordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortunately was not required outside of the United States.” Ihe did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. file Presi dent then says: “In tracing those events we are constantly reminded of our obli gations to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us and His safe guid ance. for which the nation makes rever ent acknowledgment and offer* humble prayer for the continuance of His fa vors.” Peace Negotiations. The peace negotiations which followed soon after the capitulation of Santiago and the preparation and signing of the protocol are discussed at length. Re ferring to the work of the peace commis sioners in Paris the President says; “These negotiations have made hopeful progress, so that 1 trust soon to be able to lay a definite t!*aty before tin- Senate with a review of the steps leading to its signature, "I do not discuss at this time the gov ernment tenure of the new possessions which will < omi to us as the r* suit of the war with Spain.

It is important that our relations with this peoph shall be of the most friendly character and our com mercial relations close and reciprocal. 1: should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island', encourage the industry •>! the people and as-i-t them to form a gov ernment which shall bo free and ind< - pend* :.t. thus r* aliz .a the host a tions of the < 'ubaii people. “Spanish rule must bo replaced by a just, b ncvolrnt and human.* government, created bv the people of Cuba, capable 'f iwiforming all Internati< nal obligations and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity and promote peace and good-will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have be. n tlieir relations in the pas*. Neither revenge tier passion should have a place in the new govern ment. Until there i~ complete tranquil.i ty in the island and stable government in augurated military • cciipatiou will be con tinued.” •tther i oieigu Relations. The President says that with on ex ception, the rupture with Spain, the in tercourse ( ,f ih,* United States with tin great family of nations during th* pa t year has been marked with cordiality, t'otic, i- ing negotiations with tin- Argen tine government, initiated with a view to removing differences* in cable rate eharg. ' imposed against messages ask ing from and to the United States, the President expresses bis sillci-r* desire for an international agreement whereby in t • rehange ■ ■tuessages over ng lines may b. regnlateil on ;t fair basis of uniformity. and adds: "it would be Miaiige wet * {lie nations oot in time luatteiit to f-aiiz** that modern • ■itilizalioti, whii-h owes so nitn-h of its pt -aiiss to the annihilation of time b;. tie electrical demands that this all-im portant means of conuiimiientien b- a h-ti ' -■ i peoples, t -be administered and regulated in their common behalf.*” To tlte killing and wounding of strik ing miners in Lnz“nie county.

"that eons!.!..rations of expedi ency and iiiti riiatixii.il poll y ns between the several governments interested in the (otistrin ti'di and control of an jnter occanic canal by this route require the maintenance of the status quo until the ■ anal ■ -oiiiniissiijn sliall have r**port**d and the United States Cougr—shall hav< iial the opportunity to pass finally uru.n the whole matter."
