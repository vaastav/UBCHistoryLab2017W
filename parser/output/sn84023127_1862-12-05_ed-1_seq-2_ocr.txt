AII.1I V CHEATS. Anions a parcel of shoes issued to the Army of the Potomac t Harper's Ferry, many of them are without soles, and on examination they were found lo bo without pegs or thread, and merely failed on. The most wholesome exhibition taat we can think of, as eminently fit to be made, would be a lut of swindling contractors and manufactuiers for the army strung up in a row, each one bavins no connection with terra firma, except by means of a rope noosed around bis neck and attached to a cross piece over his Lead and the crose-piece to a pott set in the ground, and also having hung around hi9 neck a dozen pair of sham shoes, or a shoddy coat or blanket, a few pounds of stinking meat, or other samples of whatever articles he bad cheated the Government and the soldiers in. This for the exhibition on one side ol the road. On the other there should be a oorrespondirg row of go-betweens and inspectors, eus-tiended and equipped in like manner with the evidences of their dis honesty in j rocuring fraudulent contracts, or in allowing for a bribe the bogus articles to pass inspection. If a tingle exhibition of this sort did not put an effectual stop to these swindling practices, it would be well to re peat it till it did. It is curious to see how quickly a perverse and unpatriotic nature shows itself. In Con gress the Speaker has hardly taken hie seat aud a message is sent to notify the President that the House is ready to receive any com munication from him before up starts, Vnl landigbam, Cox and Richardson not to say a wcrd against the rebels, not to propose any thing which looks towards putting down the rebellion, not to propose aav measures for ailing the finances, nor to help our suflerin soldiers, not to protect the army from Til- lainous cheats, not to ask what can be done to make discipline more effective, not to stir a patriotic feeling with reference to our re lations to Foreign powers; oh, no, nothing of that sort ; but to start questions about newspapers suppressed nd persons arrested by military authority arrested as all the world knows, on the supposition that they are hos tile to their own government and friendly to the causj of the rebels. If these men had any patriotism in their bosoms they would have felt that the topics which they were so eager to introduce could well wait till more urgent business had had some attention. But every creature, after his kind. InisKscivrsG ii Camp. Wc understand that Gov. lio'brook kas caused his proclamation for Thanks iving to be transmitted to the ofScers of nil the Vermont regiments. The Qoremor has alio requested tho officers in command of tho Ver mont regiments la the vicinity cf Washington, including tho ro regimenu of nine months men, the 10th and 11th regimes: ard ths 1st Vt. cavalry, to make rack provision as the; can, eon eistently with tho requirements of the service, for keeping the annual feast in camp Tho soldiers will gratefully remember Gov. llctbrook for this thrughtfal con'idexation of them, and for this re quest, that, though away from the quiet firesides where they hare been wont to celebrate this yearly festival, they may yet have the opportunity of keeping the feast as Vennonters who have ever honoredand celebrated the day. Freeman . All right so far as Got. Holbzook is con cerned ; but as to tho " provision for keep ing the annual feast, in camp," the personal friends of the young men have folt that they had something to do. And fo far as this immediate neighborhood is concerned, they have done it. The weight of the boxes con taining comestibles, roast turkeys and fixinf," cheeses, preserved fruits and other articles palatable and wholesome for the well and the sick, too numerous to mention, as the merchants say, which left the Express ffice in this T la oe .mostly Saturday morning, tat .1 few boxes Fridiv moruiog, was above Airy ojjfA hundred jmutds ! The expectation was that the.whole would be in Washington, in ample time for transmis sion to camp on or before the morning of the 4th. If the articles give the boys as much enjoyment in the use as the prepara tion and dispatching of them has given to their friends at home, the account will be well balanced. THE 

ADVANCE IX THE PHICE OF SEWsPArERS. The fact that the cost of white paper whereon to print newspapers has increased already more than 50 per cent., with a cer tainty that it will be still further advanced, that the cost of ink has increased 25 per cent. , that Government has imposed a heavy tax up on their advertisements and:incomes (if they have any), has induced a general movement among the newspaper publishers of the country to increase their prices. Newipapers, and particularly daily papers, have long been furnished to their readers at less than cost the publishers making up their loss from advertisements. Bat the ex perience of the last five years has shown that advertising is subject to great fluctuations, and must not be relied upon to so larze an extent as heretofore in meeting the cost of journalism. At the sime time the expenses of making newspapers have rapidly and heavily increased, as has their scope and : character. Tbey spend many times more for news, correspondence, and editors, ana for the mechanical part of their production, than tbey did five or ten years ago. And when to this is added an increase in the cost oi paper and ink. the load becomes too heavy to be borne. The paper which pub- ishers have bought for from 9 to 11 cents a pjunl for the past twenty years, is now held at 17 cents, and is still advancing. They must raise their rates or be ruined. A month of such discrepancy as now exists between (he coet of white paper and the price of the Tinted sheet, would wtpe out a whole year's net income in the largest establishments, and impoverish the weaker onea. The causes of this rise in the price of taper are several. For some years the increase in amount of manufacture has exceeded the in crease of supply of rags. Owing to the pre sent tariff duties but little rags have besn imported lor some time past. And the scarcity of cotton has diverted a Urge amount of paper stock from its former ut:' to be worked up into shoddy" and go into cloth again. The prices of chemicals used in paper making have also greatly in creased of late. Thus there is a scarcity of materials to make paper of. Of course the rice of wbito taper must go up, and conse quently the price of newspapers. Toe Boston ropers have already aonocnceu an adrance in their price to take effect on Dec. 1st. The New York tapers cannot delay advancing lunger than the 1st of January. Tbey would have "dune so bcljre this, it is stated, but for the obstinacy of the Herald. The Philadelphia papers have also determined to raise prices, the Hartford pa pers have advanced, the SpriogEeld Kepub liean goes up in a mcntb, ,and the 'Western papers generally. Wc are no more fortunate in contracting for paper than our neighbors, and are com pelled to raise the price of the Fan Pkes. We prefer this course to reducing the size of our sheets or in any way imrairing the talut of the paper to our readers. And in common with the other newsparers in the place, wc advanced our price on Mon day. Our terms are given in another place. Thrs advanei of price will go to pay for material alone, and in no way towards in Creasing the profits of the establishment. On the contrary, in consequence of the increased cost of Iivini, our profits, ever of the small est, will be this coming year most ' beau tifully Uts." For no man thinks that he is called on to furnish butter cr egg", floor or pork, to a printer, for anytbingless than the very highest market price ; though often times such an one is quite sure that because he could heretofore get a city weekly for $1 a year, therefore we should be content to let him have the Fret Press for halt a dollar lis than its price. But the taxes, whether directly upon our selves from the Government, or indirectly by being levied on articles of consumption, we shall pay without grumbling. We shall also furnish our issues at as low a price as we can afford, and are sure our friends und patrons will not find jast cause for grum bling cither. Correspondence of tho Free Press.

While most of the questions of tho Session arc now decided, there yet remains the question if retaining or striking r,it from the Statutes certaia sections relating to Personal Liberty. The lec tion most objectionable, to those who regard ss pecislly the constitutionality if the law, the House hare consented to strike out. The sections relating to trial by jary, in ease cf attempted ren dition of fugitive slaves, they decline to strike out.

This labor vas done by bim gratuitously Friday night.and also for the parcels forward ed from this place "three or four weeks ago. The labor was not slight, and the lavjr con ferred, was a great one. As we knew that when the boxes were deposited in the Ex press tffice, Mr. Fciler had to pay the charge for expresjjge to Washington, ne took the liberty of inquiring of him nrxt morning' whether he had been made good lor his outlay. He told us that most who brought in packages for him to scud paid him. according to what they sent ; but that some omitted to do so and that in fact he was several dollars out ol pocket by the transaction.

The House on Siturday afternoon after a lively debate, passed a bill for incorporating a short line of railroad to run op through Essex County. A sketch ol tbe debate is given in the report oi the Freeman as follows : Tfat Eimx County fUIlro&i Bill wts ag&la Ufcen up. Mr Iloaiton of Victor, stated that aj the bill was ot great Importance to hu corutitcent?. he desired to apeak in its support. He thought those who opposed the road were mistaken in their sup position, mai ue consiracuon oi tou road would material lojure their own Interests. It was sot, at all events, for the State of Vermont and her Leg iila tare, to jield their dignity or their interest ia a cam like this. Little Essex County ajked for legislation in her behalf, and hoped the oppo sition of those who had their roads baiit, and had no need now of that aid which was onee Impor tant to them, wuu.d ntjt a ail to prevent Essex from gaining what she asked for. He continued at length, to reply to arguments adracced by other railroad interests against the Essex County road. He was Lot afraid as some professed to be, of inviting the cuMay of British capital In the State of Vermont. The ueitLn was whether to legislate for the people of Vermont or to be guided by the preferences of men and icorpe rations not of thState. Mr. 1'nderwooa of Xewbury, believed that the Leziilature were desirous of beim? iruided bv fust and equitable principles in the decision of this queetioi.

A cuirtspondeot ot the Ltjbton Journal gives the following byjothev fris of tbe introductiun uf the word "skedad dle into the military vocabulary I hare been engaged In lumbering in the Wis consin pinery for a number of year, and tbe word was in general use among all the lumbermen, raftmcn and flat boatmen on the upper Mississippi and its tributaries, and when the war broke out that class of men enlisted almost universally, and in all the States bordering on tbe river, and car rying their words and customs with them, many of their ex pre ions were adopted by other regi ments; and from the fact that the word "skedaddle-" was not much noticed until after the six weet ern regiments had teen sent by Fremont to the defence of Washington, I think they carried it with them, and It was then adopted by the rest of the army. But ceitain it is tbat it is not a new word, for I fmnd i' in constant use among that class of men six years ago, and I hare heard old trappers say (last Siring) that they had heard It used eier since they oould recollect. Thus if a deer was frightened it was said to "skedaddle"; so when two crews cf raftmen had a rou;h let-to, the crew which ran was said to "skedaddle." It was In constant ute s a slang term to denote retreating or making oat.'? self scarce. Mr. Uartlitt, the intelligent correspond ent of tbe A.

" For that manifestation acd ibis benediction it behooves us to te thankful." These arc the wor Js of a Southern shareholder. after emancipation by act of Congress has made tbe city he presides over a free city. They are the words cf a man who was a slaveholder for we have no sUvebolders in Washington or the District of Columbia now acd who is a loyal cit izen : so loyal tnat he loves tbe Union a good deal better than he docs slavery. This is the grand test ol a man's patriotlfm. Docs he love , the Unlet, better than he dos slavery?

Mr. Casey uf Kentucky the only emancinA- tionist in Congress from that State bad a very interesting Interview with the President a day or two since. Mr. Caey informed Mr. Lincoln that while originally he did not like his emancipa tion proclamation, that now he did not desire bita to go back to retreat from the petition he had taken , it would be so universally regarded as an ridencc i f weakness in the Government. The PresiJent informed him that he need hare no fears on that sco c he should not Uke back a ord. He Lad no desire to ittT ere with tbe p- jl of the loyal state oat?. subjsct. and hi Tuld not do so ; bit as for rebtls, let them p .(are for emancipation ! Mr. laey thoas that he potseast the old-fash ioned Kentucky manliness and truth. "Though this p reclamation would not hate orizlaallv suit ed me eays he, "aal even if I was not suited with it now, I would not ice you do S3 cowardly a thing as to retrace your step at the dictation of Democrats ani slaveholders," Thete were not is exact words, but they contain the meant az and sense of those words. In discussing the whole subject, the Preside n t gart evidence of much thought upon it, and some of his ideas were original and startling. One of them I will allude to In detail. Mr. Lincoln said that he had often thought of the narrow es cape ol tbe South from a general slave insurrect ion the winter alter the election of lai . The Fremont campalsn. as Is well known, was follow ed by oae attempt at insurrection in Tcarevsee. The alavemfeters of the South charged the .Re publicans upon the stump with desiring the free dom of the slaves ; and not only that, bat with a purpose, ll xremont was elected, ol lorcicly let ting the slaves free. The slaves ail ov.r the South were full of du content at the defeat of th Republicans. This discontent In tome Iccilities came sear developing into an open Insurrection. This fact made a deep impression uaon the mini cf the President, and he told Mr. Casey that the slirei of the South understood fully now, as they have never understocd before, that the crvfcem I.

W. A." the correjnond.Tit .if .. Savannah Ilrpublnan gives tbe following as w ututic in iavE oeen tne losses ol the Confederate in the battles named : Our loss in killed and wounded at Fort Dunelson may lye roughly estimated at 3,500 ; at Koanoke and on the Xortii Caro in nSJ"" ,r Eih0la 3'm ' atShiluh 10,000 ; at illimhurg, Seven Pines, and before Kichmond 20,000; in the valley cf the Shenandoah 5,000 ; t Cedar IJun 1,200 at tho second battle of JIjnassa3 0,0007 at ltjonston and Crauptun Gaps 4,000 ' at Sharpsburg 10,000 ; at Corinth 4,000 - at Perrjville 3.000 ; and 5,000 for those who have fallen at outputs, in skirmishes, ic These figures, added together, make the enormous sum of 75.OC0 ! OI this number it would be safe to say that one-third, or 2-5,000 are now in their graves, having either bien killed outright or dil from wounds. Quite as many (probably mi re) have died S?rf To fheuId k aJJl -0,000 more for those who have been maimed and those whose health hai been ruined for life. Thus our losses in ten months of the present year may be estimated at 75 000 men who hove cither periihed or have b:en disabled. If the whole truth were known they would probably reach 100,000 by the eud of the year, for the deaths Irom dicase in the hospitals in caiap and at homo -ener-ullv eiceed those in battle. For ever? jear the war continues we must npect our casu alties to be quite as heavy as thev have been tee present. Mr Owen lArejoy of 111., moved to lay the resolution on the table.

TIIC HETUItNED rRISOXEHS. We learn from one ot the non-commissioned ofSccrs of the 6th Vt. regiment, the following interesting particulars of the capture, treatment, etc , by the Confederates of a portloa of three companies of that regiment : A part ot lure companies, u ana xi.w.ro oa detached duty at Bayou des Alleaands, on th 4th of Sept. last, when they were surprised and made prisoners bya party of l.SdO.er lOOeosfederates, consisting of the Terrebonne Infantry and a com pany of mounted Texan rangers, commanded by Major McWaters. They were marched oo the tame day to Baceland, ani searched, their arms, tccoutrements, etc., taken from them, and from thence to Lafourche, where rations were given out at 3 P. M., after which they were taken to rhibo dauxville, having performed a march of about IS miles sicce their capture. At the Istter place they were confined In tbe court house all night, and sent tho next day to the Terrebonne station, a di.tir.ee of 3 miles, where they took the cart for Beiwick's Bar. Scvej of their number, however, were placed unler extra guard at Thibodauxville and sent back to Bayon des AllemandJ, where they were ordered to be shot, on the ground that thev bad been enlisted at Xew Orleans. The names of thete unfortunate seven men were : John and Michael Laclidal, Michael Musbil, Paul. Hearse, Barnet and Baker. On arriving at Beiwick't Bay, the prisoners were pot on a boat and taken to New Iberia, and from thence marched a distance of seven miles, toa point known as Camp Pratt, where they re mainid seven weeks. After this they were placed oa board the little steamer Cricket, taken up the Teehe and down to tbe mouth of Red Kite.-, where they were placel on board the steamer Louis d'Or, and taken to Vicksburg. It took six days to make thcltrip. As sa as they arrived at Vieksburg, the com missioned officers were paroled, with the privilege of walking up and down one street, a short dis tance say thirty or forty yards, and all the non cornmittioaed officers and privates were lodged in jail. Katiou of corn bread, badly baked, were given then: twice a day, and beef of a poor qual ity once. They were generally treated courteously by the officers placed over them, but they complain ef the bard fare they were forced to put up with . Thoee men who were formerly Confederate sol diers at Fort Jacksoa weredeta s d at Vieksburg. Their Bamet are Thomes Grtaia, DerrJs Cain and William Brown. Sergeant Charles Mill tod private Edwin Spers, both of Royalton, V- a oat, were draws os l by lot and detained also, 't a are nea informed a to the reason of the deten' u n of the latter two men. Four men died denng the time of captivity, rii: David E.
