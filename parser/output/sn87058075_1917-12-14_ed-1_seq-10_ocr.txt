READY FOR ALL DUTIES Department Will Need Over Billion Dollars In Next Year For Rigorous Prosecution of War. Washington, Dec. 10.—The annual report of Secretary of the Navy Dan iels, just made public, makes pride in the achievements of the navy since the United States entered the war, its keynote. Nothing of Value to Foe. The report is carefully worded, so that no bit of information that miglu be of benefit to the enemy may be communicated by it. The report oi the general board of the navy, which lias been charged with seeking solu tions to the submarine menace ant! other grave problems, is suppressed in its entirety. Only the general uuestions considered by the boanl are given. In the secretary's report a few facts come to light that hav. not before been printed, but none is of great importance. Daniels Sums up Report. Secretary Daniels himself sums up the report in these words: "In the navy we have prepared for and have met the duties of the pres ent we are preparing for and are onKdent we will Lie able to meet any CMH for griator duties, for more ev. ting responsibilities. The best way to secure enduring peace is to pre vire unceasingly, night and day, for he winning of the war, whether it be long or short. This we have done: iliis we are doing: this we will con tinue to do." Eig Problems Met. Problems that have arisen and liro-e been met since the declaration of war with Germany are listed by Secretary Daniels as follows: 1'reparing for impending and ac tual war. The co-ordinating of our efforts. The carrying on of offensive opera tions against opponents. Providing safe passage for ships transporting army across the ocean. Maintaining available naval forces a state or readiness for battle. Providing additional fighting units necessary to bring the war to a suc cssful conclusion. Training personnel to man the new wits of the navy and to assist in manning the merchant marine. Since the beginning of the war 745 vessels have been commissioned and manned. Too Many Volunteers. The navy actually was embarrassed in the early days of the war by the r.agerness with which young America responded to the call for naval re cruits. "The navy's efforts at recruiting were so successful that it was dif ficult with the then facilities to take care of the flood of volunteers," the secretary says. Estimates for Coming Year. Secretary Daniels estimates that the total expenditures for naval activi ties during the next fiscal year at ?1,039,650,502.84. All appropriations not essential to the rigorous prosecu tion of the war are excluded from this estimate. CUBA READY TO DECLARE WAR Action Against Austria Is Expected At Once. Havana, Dec. 10.—The belief is ex pressed by several congressmen that President Menocal today would send a message to congress asking that a declaration be made that a state of war exists between Cuba and Austria Hungary. Cuba was the first of the Latin-Am erican countries to follow the United States in declaring war against Ger many, and the expectation is that she will duplicate this action in the case Df Austra-Hungary. To Repudiate All Loans. London, Nov. 10.—The bolshevik! government, according to a Reutev dispatch l'rom Petrograd, is preparing a decree repudiating all Russian for eign loans and loans concluded by land banks and railways on govern ment guarantees.

DEATH TOLL GROWING 4,000 Killed In Halifax Blast By Latest Estimates. Snowdrifts Three Feet Deep Add to Difficulty of Relief Work—City Still Dazed. Halifax, Dec. 10.—Ths admir alty court to determine responsi bility for the collision of. the vesrels that caused the explosion will open its hearings today. The survivors of the Norwegian steamer, I mo, which rammed the Mont Bianc, laden with munitions, have been arrested and Captain Lamedoc, Pilot Mackay of the munitions ship also were or dered detained as witnesses. Halifax, N. S., Dec. 10.—A new es timate by the superintendent of morgues, whose duty it is to assemble and expose for identification, if pos sible, the bodies of those who perished by shock or fire when the ammunition ship Mont Blanc blew up in the har bor here, places the number of dead at 4,000. 1,000 Bodies Recovered, His estimate that startled even those who had lived through the last few days of horror was based upon the records of his district assistants, who reported a total of 1,000 bodies recovered. They have figured on a certain number for a prescribed area. There appears to be no other way of determining the loss. Hundreds, per haps thousands, of bodies have been consumed by the flames and in scores of cases not only whole families but whole neighborhoods have been wiped out and the names of all these dead may never be known. Dredging parties working under di rection of naval authorities dragged ashore 200 bodies of sailors, soldiers and laborers recovered from the bot tom of the harbor. Another searching squad reported having found 40 bodies in the hulk of the Norwegian steamer Imo which collided with the Mont Blanc. 20,000 Persons Destitute. But the outstanding fact that has been faced by the local authorities with a courage that challenges the ad miration of their kinsmen from south of the border, is tVat 20,000 persons are destitute and of the number per haps one out of seven is suffering from injuries, which in many cases are bound to prove fatal. Through roads three feet deep in snow, a correspondent of the Asso ciated Press yesterday went over a strip of Halifax more utterly demol ished than any of Belgium or France. The ruin is complete. Ecuador Breaks With Germany. Guayaquil, Ecuador, Dec. 10.—Ecua dor lias joined the group of South American nations which have broken relations with Germany.
