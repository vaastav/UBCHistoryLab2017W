ST. CLAIRfeyiLLU, O.: Thursday, t3odi-'id;A866. How Shall we Sleep! [From Harper's Weekly.] As we apenl about oriethiWhof our lives in sjtap the eircumauncc. uni'cr winch we A it. ahanlil hn wr.ll nriinrea1. . The nlcmina psrtment eboulJ beofrvch and have. i . i- ...a fiiiA hrftnnr SUCH arrana;pmaino r.ium Bnpply of frsh air. From cur own o!cr ation we bare no hesitation in wiying thar even anion well conJitinneJ peoi'lo iho?e .;.;nna mrm nnl arlflnnatnlv attended 10. Mn.t ofihera elfPD in rooms that re b"th 1 toe amall and nhut up too closely. A gallon of frfh ir etery minute, lot it lie remni berd, is the requisite for earn person. This certainly cannot be furninheil to any one in closed room ol ten fret cqnaro. end yet this is very common limit of alacpinp; oc commodatient, with no inlets for fresh air except the crevices. The cae ix worro than it is with epartmanta for the day, for in tnem the doers are opened frequently, and nd thus some considerable change is t fleet ed in the air. Very often tho slorping acfomtnodahons re even mure limited than we have men tioned, especially in the case of clii'drcn. Several ol them put into ( veti a (toon sizcu apartment do not have air enough if it be closed, and surely not whon thoy are put into a small one, as thoy ofinn are. It is quite important that with ventilation tWa should be a proper degree of warmth, nd bone lit is much easisr to secure thorough ventilation in sleeping apartmunts when the whole house is warmed from a furnace than when it is not. And here we would sny that it U ft fle notion that no air is good except that whioh is introduced directly from with out. That which comes trom the open pna faces ol the hou' is as good as that which comes tbrouBU open wiuduws. The airthnt tomes froui the pipes ol'a fiirnaoo is ns fresh, that is at pure, ns fully charped with oxygen, as cold air is. Ili'sting it does not injure it. If tho attempt Li mode to secure ventilation alone by letting down the top of ft window, there is good d .n.-pr tl.itt cold will be taken, especially if the room bo small. This had bi Iter be only one of the moans of ventilation, and then there n'"od not be so wide an opening as to have this liability. Niput is tho timo for sleep, as day is the time for woik. This is naturu'a indication. nd harm always comes from not following it. Sloan in the mornina is not an rclrnsh ing as that whioh is had in tho night, when wo have nature's favoring oircumHtnnccs, the darkness and stillness. When wo turn night into day, either with plcnsuro or la bor, we do violence to nature, and, of course, inflict more or lots injury on our physical syntems. Many a clergyman is tempted to sit up luto at night in preparing his sermons, tiartlv fruit the quietness of tho hour, and partly from tho necessity of securing the preparation in timo. Hut cvory time that lie does this there is an impairment of the health, and particularly if it bo donn Satur day niiiht, beeauMe tho injury Mr enhanced bv tha labors of the following dav. Sleep may he imperfect. It may be bro ken by impression, made apon the Nensoe, er bv menial operation. Ilia more ono dreams the more impmfuot is the tlticp, for mind and bruin are in action in dreaming, nd they do not have entire rest. There la ditlorencn in dreams as well ns in wide awake thinking in tho amount of exrtion Sometimes drcutijlng amounts to real men tal labor, and so impairs greutly tho res which siren is duicenod " -'ive. i . Of courso the less perfect the sleep the longer isthu time which it ought to' occupy. It is mutter of economy, thon, to those i with whom time is of valoo, to have tho ' alceo as norfect as possible. ,i Ilow, then, oan sleep life uiwlo perfect? J bore are various eu'cuniHtanccs to be ro carded in cfTcoliug this. When we sleep wo shoulj Klcep. W should make abusinn so' it. Then' should be no mingling of the, wukeful and the sleeping oondition. We should dismiss tho thoughts and business of the day. We should havn a habit of doing this. Thsre is muuh in this point. Tho thing is quite Within our control, and a liat'it ot passing readily from the wakctal state into sound eleen ran bo formed by a proper attention to the circumstances that will favor it. Regularity is important hero. There should be a rerular lime for retiring, and also for risiiif. If this bo not doiio, there will not only bo much time often waMed getine to hlep, but tho aleep will bo apt t be imperfect. We do not moan that one should retire preci.wly at tho satno ininiil evurv nislit this would bo mukinir one slave to time, and tho very exactness would impair the s ceo. Much nmy be done by shcor will. W can will toouliudnwn inontnl action, an dismiss trains of thought. If we enn not do thia directly we can indirectly. W a ca supplant thoughts which wuld burden th mind, .and thus pass mind and bruin int the sleeping state in a worried condition, I indulging in thouuMs ot diverse an lighter character, lotting usgcnlly slip int our rest for the night. Ilow very common ly the contrary courso is puruedl 1 It business man goes to bed thinking of some plan for making money, nr for solving some perplexity ; the proiesbintmi man is tm with some tram ot thought oonuected wit his daily employment, and tho student worrying bis mind up tu tho last of h . wakeful moments with some portiou of to morrow lessons. Rut besides all this, and above all this, the arrangements of the day have a decided influence upon the charauter of our sleep. That sloep maybe good the business of the day should be done altogether in the day, nd the evening should be tho lime for re laxation and diversion. In this way there will be proper preparation for undisturb ed, psrfect sleep. All mental employment in the evening should bo gentle and amus ing. It is no time for real work. All the study that Is donn in the evening, flspnaiitlly by the young, does harm tn both body and . -mind, and ono way in which it does this by impairing the sleep. The encroachments which fashion msles tjpon nature'a time for sloep are large source of disease in its votaries. Tho Ian- mot of tbe nexf day tells what theuoisnpent ' hour have done, and thia often repeated, .Ukiug something each liiiioftom theneided repair and reatoration, lessens decidedly the general vigor, and thus prepares for actual - disease. In strong con rust with thh is legitimate use in ibe evening of the pleas- tire ot society which ma have indicated., r,Wben will the truly rational and conscivn vtieus resist the dictatrl of fashion and " their gnests of theouoessity of turning night intdsyT In conclusion, we say, sleep enough sleep in tbe light place sleep at the right " time sleep well. Some eeern to grudge " the tin given to sleep if it were J' time. J?ut the hour of deep should h'.- welcomed as well as the hoar of waking, the time fer the reat should bo arranged - for u torapulously as the time for action. ll - 1 M A 'I BrasMfto Hl .11 .

Report the Secretary of the Treasury. [From the New York Tribune.] city The Report of the Secretary of -nry, given elxcwhere i full, is eminently judicotis, and enntarns suggestions wel cal culated to reduce the national finances to or der, and ploefthe busines of the communi ty upon a solid bssis. He declares the na tional debt too nnything but blessing, but while sati-fird thst it should be paid by the feneration which created it, does not aeo the way ' to continue its liquidation by aurplus income faster thno six or seven .mil lion! per Hionth prior to June, 1 868. He is of opinion that tho honor of the Govern ment requires an early withdrawal of tho lecal-tender notes, leaving the National Hank toMiimlv the currency of tie coun try, lie antes the system of redemption by by the banks at the Atlantic cities or at ono New York. He acknowledges tho ti- nanciul wants of the South so far as curren cy is concerned, but is of opinion that their needs should be supplied by curtniling tho issues of the Northern banks. lie advo rates a reduction of tho currency, and such a rcvicion of the tariff as will give new vigor r nrodnctive industry throughout the ITninn. - Hn urirps the issue of bonds at 4i nr fl ner cent interest, navable principal in Kurope, to be exchanged for United States bonds now held in Kurnno, as well as to supply tho future demand for Federal stocks in Kurnpe. Upon the question of contrac tion of tho currency his language is very clear; indeed, without contraction he is con fident that wide spread disaster mni ne ex perienced. In regard to resumption ne is I opinion that it can take place ry Jury, 80S, and may be brought about earlier. Tho estimates oP the Treasury for the ast throe quarters of the fiscal ycarto June JO. 1S67, are as follows Receipts Expeuses ..$31 fi 500.000 ... 237,109,143 Surplus ' $79,830,857 nd for the year ending June 30, 18C3: Receipts $435000.000 Kxponsof 350,247,041 Surplus $85,752,358 Tho docrcaso in the the publio debt from tlvo highei-t point is stated by the Secretary as follows: Debt August, 18(5 $2.7.')7,RO3,0S6 Debt Oct. 31. ItJOG 2,551,424 121 Decrease $200,879,505 The Socrotary has small comfort for free traders, and says: 'The long hoped-for period whon there shall bo no local obstructions to a free ex- hnngo of commodities between the United States ami other countries is still fur in future. Duties upon imports aro not only ncocssarv for revenue, but also for the pro lection of those home interests upon which heavy internal taxes are to be assessed. In presenting bis views, ho ."Does not mean (0 assert that the adop tion of all these measures (although be gards eaoh as important) is absolutely oossarv to return to specie payments, that other remedies may not bo adopted Congress to rescue the country from financial troubles. He presents, he considers it to be his duty to do, his views, and asks that they may receive rare fill consideration, and bo adopted if they commend themselves to tho wimlom ol Uon grcss. and relucted if measures bettor ciliated to secure the desired end can devised. Tho most sanguine and hopeful must perceive that tho business of tho coun try cannot for a much longer time be upon the present high level with safety.. J ho snecu stive interest, lurge and power ful in itself, is receiving daily now accessions of strength y the increase of individual credits: and when speculators and debtors control the financial pnlioy of the couutry, a tinunciul collapso is inevitable.' The Report should command eirelul study from every tax-payer or business men Its recommendations may not be enfoiced bv legislation, but thev are none the valuable as tho opinion of one who, from position and experience, possesses lnlorma lion not accessible to the publio at large. Tho Secretary has placed himself Ftiuare' ly on the record in favor of contraction specie payments, and really oA- wo powm-i to ennblf him to fund the liort and reunite in Juhl. 18G8. It remains to be seen whether Congress differs with him to the extent of repealing exmtiiiff luwt, under which the secretary will proceed toward resumption. Unless rnirnl is to be the order of tho duy, people eunnot bo too careful about gel ting in debt, Close Quarters with a Meteor. is the rid lost be and tbe tha ce- fn- Ono of tho editors of tho New Orleans Picayune, writing concerning meteors give the following story ot bis personul expou ones with one of no ordinary character : It, was in Ilia mouth ol iNovemhor, il we are not mistaken, in '511, that wu weto rid ing on tho West side, of tho Notices, be tween Casa Rlatiea mid San Pstrico, with Cuptain Munn, of I'orpus Cbristi. We had bceu looking over the country, hunting a sheep ranelie, got belated in the valley, and were wending our way buck toward Casa ltbincii, near w hich we were enewnped, when all of ft sudden the prairies were brilliantly lit up, and a meteor.which seemed to us large as hogshead, went hissing, howling, and rooting over our heads close over our heads loo close, entirely, to tiff nd us any pleasure quite tha contrary. Our hori-e did not start, did not shy they simply sipnt tint, and we down with I hem. bliudod and bewildered, lo our right was ft hill nr bluff, and over this the huge me teor, looking like a locomotive all abluie, camu suddenly ; wo had 11 sign or token of its advanoe until it was upon us. It might bavo heon a hundred feet over our heads might have been two humliid it did not seem to be twenty. It wie flying r.esrly horiiontally, in W esterly direction. and with incredible velocity. It was throw ing off hissing sparks, which we could hear above tbe howling' of the motenr. ; Stag gered and blinded at first, our horses snort ing with fright as they struggled to their feet, on oponing our eyes the meteor was aeen lighting up the rolls of tho prairies miles away from us, and in a few momenta nil was darkness and quiet again. Suoh is but ft feeble aooount of what we saw on the Muooesin November. 'S3, and we shall never forget that display. The effect of the shower of falling stars of 'S3 was bewilder ing ; that of the meteor in 53 was absolu tely stunning. Had it been ft mile or two up over head we could give tuuoh better description of the fiery monster; it came close enough to blind, atagger, oonftue, as tound and affright both berse and man, tod that is all we can say about it. - , , It is little that we know about meteor' one way or the other, although, we believe that we have had oloaer view of one than ordinarily fall to the lot of aian. j We have otten thougbt that the one we saw on the inueoea, iram me direction it was taking, must haye struck tbe earth somewhere thie side ot me uio uiande, ir it did not burn itself out during its fierce transit, Had it been a settled country alone- it nnnr.. abeuld ell bare heard and read a deal about it As it was, save perhaps mvulf a.nt enaananion. the only spectator of tha m... ifioent meteoric display were tbe deer and. wild mustangs of mo aosert beyond the tuoa.
