THURSDAY EVENING, DEC. 17,1908, ? Thk Episcopal Council wtiich melin tbis city yesterday made no mistake in elevating Kev. Merry mao Creen to tbe bishopric. We have biblical authority tbat tbe prayers of the righteous avail much. Daring the past months prayer baa been offered in all the churches in the diocese tbat the delegate** to the council be spiritually guide 1 in the se? lection of a bishop aud this prayer seems to bave been answered in the fullest measure and of course proves the righte? ousness of those who offered it. Mr. Creen poasessea every qualification that befits a bishop. He is in the prime of life; is a scholar; a fine preacher; is broad in his views aud sympathies and commands not only the respect but the love of all with whom he is thrown. He filled most acccp'ably the rectorship ol Christchurch, this city, leaving hereto accept a professorship at the Theologi? cal S-minary, which place will be diffi? cult to fill ahould be decide to accept the bishopric. ______*__*- Lom-i \ ??:u in speaking of the work by Augustus r-'aint O-tu dena, at thp C. rc rau < --ilery of Art, jd Washington on Tue-day night, said that in addjtion tj being a gnat sculptor, Saint t'.udens had given tho American people a coinage "not jet properly ap? preciated," but wbich was "an aJditi n to the sum of art of all the natiooa." By moat people tbe new coins were thought cot to compare in beauty with the old ones, while many others consider them abortions. Mr. Roosevelt, however, is very contemptuous ol those who diflei with him on tbe subject and it would not be surprising il be sent another mee *age to Congress abusing all those who rfind fault with the St, Gaudeno coins.

The House today administered its form..l rebuke to tbe president for his insinuation, in his annual message, that members of Congress were afraid of in vestipation by the secret service. Resolutions were adopted, as prepar? ed by tbe select committee, of wbich Mr. Perkins is chairman, calling upon the president for aoy evidence he may have, connecting any member of the House witb corrupt action in his official capaci? ty. The president is also asked to in? form tbe House whether he bas institu? ted proceeding for the punishment of any such member. Tbe resolutions read as follows: "Whereas there was contained in tbe sundry civil appropriation bill which passed Congress at its last session, and became a law, a reference to employment of tbe BOtret service in the Treasury Department and, "Whereas iu the last annual message of the president ol the United Slates to tbe House of Congress, it was stated in reference to tbat provision, (Ber. the originial phrases are quoted) and, "Whereas the p'ain meaning of the above words is that the majority of tht congressmen were in fear of being ic vestiga'ed by secret service men and that Congress, as a whole, was actuated by tbat motive toenailing theprovsision in question and, Whereas, your commit? tee appointed to consider those state? ments of tbe president and to report to the House carnot find in the hearings before committee, nor in the records of the House or Senate, aoy justification of tbis impeachment of the honor and in? tegrity of the Congress and, Whereas your committee would prefer, in order to make an intelligent and comprehen? sive report, just to the president as well ai to the Congress, to bave all the the information which the president may have to communita'e, now therefore, ??Bi it resolved, that the president be requested to transmit to the House any evidence upon which be based bis state? ment tbat the 'chief argment in favcr of tie provision, was tbat the congressmen lid not themselves wish to be investi? gated by secret service men, and also to transmit to tbe Hous,< arv evidence con? necting any member of me House of Representatives of the 60th Congress with coirupt action in his official cap ac ty aod to inform tbe House whether he hss i s ituted proceedings for the punish in- nt of _ny such iodividunl by the courts, or bas reported any such alleged delinquencies to ihe House of Represen? tatives." Mr. Perkins, in submitting the reso Inti,jus, said he hoped they would be a lopted without debate. He then yielded the floor to Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams sud he tbonght the words used by the president in the roes saf? were an ui justified imputation of the honor and honesty of tee legislative 'ranch of the government. "Si far ss this committee has been able to dis? cover," iaid Mr. William-, "there is not a scintilla of evidence to support tbat imputation. It is only fair to the president and to Congress to afford him an opportunity as presented in the reso? lution lo give tbe committee all infor? mation in his possession relating to the matter. Tbe American people have to know if the C'ogress bas been corrupt, that it is corrupt." After a short debate the resolution was ad ltd unanimously with tbe exception of one clause, upon which tbe vote was 270 to 14._ War Declared.

SENATE REGENTS IT. A sweeping investigation of the Secret Service and the lbs of private detectives by the federal departments was authoriz? ed by the Senate yesterday afternooo, together with specific directions for con? sideration of the action that is to be taken respecting that portion of the presi? dent's message criticising Congress for restricting tbe use of secret servica men totnasury investigations and the pro? tection ot the president. The raoluti in calling for this investi? gation was ottered by Senator Aldrich, of Rhode I.Iaod, floor leader of tbe re? publicans in tbe Senate, and was adopt? ed without a dissenting vote. In tbe accompanying debate, in wbich Miara. Aldrich, Hale, Bailey, Culberson, Biccn and McLaurin participated, with Sena? tor Tillman interjecting pungent ques? tions from time to time, public declara? tion was male of the deep feeling of re? sentment which bas pervaded both ends of the Capitol ever since tbe objection? able portion of the president's message was read in Congress. Over and over again tbe language ueeJ by the pres'dent was characterized as an insult to Onngrea. Senator Bailey told tbe Senate the expressions truno the president constituted a "most wanton insult," Senator Culberson, of Texas, floor leader of the minority, said "it was a deliberate, a studied and a gratuitous insult to the Congress." Senator Tillman told his colleagues the president was investigating them "generally," that Mr. Roosevelt re? garded them as "a lot of rascals who need investigation." Then Mr. Till? man added, "Now, there mar be men here wbo feel tbat way, but God knows I do net." And tbe crowded galleries, packed ti the wal's, burst into laughter, The keenest and most rapier-like thrust was that which came from Senator Bacon, of Georgia, a member of the for? eign relations committee, when he de? clared: "Mr. President, it is my deliberate judgment tbat if the king of England were to send such a message lo the Par? liament of Great Britain there would be but ooe thing which would shield him from the lois of his crown?that would be tbe appointment of a regent." Through its action of yaterday tbe Sen? ate has, tlerefore, placed itali in entire accord with theaotion already taken by tbe l-touse of Representatives. Both branches of Congress have now referred the objectionable portion of tbe presi? dent's message to commifees for consider? ation aod report. The House chose to have tbe matter handled by the Perkins select committee, which met yeaterday snd is getting nady to report, wbile the "tanate places tbe matter in charge of its powerful committee on appropriations with explicit instructions not ooly to re? port wbat actioo, io its judgmeat, should oe taken, but with the further command ihat the committee embark upon a iweeping investigation ol alleged misuse if the secret service by the administra ;ion. When the Gazette report of the Senate proceeding closed yesterday the Aldrich ?solution aod the Culberaon's amend nent had been laid aside. Later Seni? or Kean again reported the Aldrich res ilution, raying it had been amended hy be commit'.a on audit and control cf he contingent expenses and that S*na or Culberaon's objection t. it tad been vithdrawn. Mr. Aldrich urged immediate consid iration, and tbis brought the whole mat? er befoie the Senate. It resulted in a lebate, in which no republican lifted bis -oice in defense of the praident, ind in rbich only two republicans?Aldrich .nd Hale--participated. Ealing w-s ust as strocg on the republican sa on the lemocratic side, but the majority con ented itself with allowing the demo rats to do Ihe ulkiog. Alter aa hour's lebate the Aldrich resolution was raised.
