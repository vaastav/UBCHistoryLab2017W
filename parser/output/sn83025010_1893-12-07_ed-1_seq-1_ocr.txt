The constitutional duty which requires the (president from tlmo to tlino to glvo to the con ureas Information ot tho stats of the union and recommend to their consideration such meas ures as ho shall Judgo necessary and expedient, Is fittingly cnlcrod upon by commending to the eongtrss a careful examination ot tho detailed sutenicnt and well supported recommenda tions contained In thi reports ot thi beads ot departments who are chiefly charged with the executive work ot tho government In an ef fort to ubrldgo this communication as m ich ks Is consistent wlih Its purpose, I suill supplement a brief rcftirnnos to the contents ot these departmental reports by tho mention ot such cxecutlre business snd Incident as are not embraced thiro and by such recommeu.lni'uds as appear to be at this particular tlmo appro priate. While our foreign relations hare not at all times during the fust year been entirely free from perplexity no embarrassing situation remains that will not rleld to Ihs spirit of fair ness and love of Justice, '.vhlch Joined with con sistent fairness characterizes a truly American foreign policy.

With a view of accom pushing this result within tho constitution!! llmlis ot executive power, and feojnlilng all our obligations an! responsibilities grow ing out of any chango of conditions, brought about our unjustifiable Interference our present minister at Honolulu his received appropriate Instructions ti thit end Thus nr no Information of the accomplishment of anr iloflnltc result has been recelro I from him Additional advices aro soon expected.

This far the position of our gov ernment has been that of an attentive but an Impartial observer of the unfortunito conflict In passlng.our fixed policy of Impartial neutral Ity In such a condition of affairs as now exists, I deem it accessary to disallow In a manner not to be misunderstood, tbe unau thorised action of our lato naval commander In those waters In saluting the revoluilaatit lira, tlllan admiral, being Indisposed to countenance an act calculated to giro gratuitous aanctlou to tho local Insurrections Tbe convention between our government and Chill, having for Its object the settlement and adju tmint ot the de mands of the two count les agalast each other has been made effectlvo br the organisa tion of tbe claims commission provld d for The two governments falling to agree upon tbe third member of th- commlss'on the good offices of tho president of the Swiss repub lo were Invoked, as provided ln the treatr, and the selection of the Swlsa repre sentative to this country was gratifying aline to the United States and Chill and tho vexa tious question of so-called legation ustlum for offenders against tbe state and Its laws was presented anew In Chill by the unauthorized action of the late United States minister in receiving Into bis official resldenco two persons who bad Just failed In an attempt at revolution and against ihotn criminal charges were pend ng, growlnz out of a former abortlvo disturb ince, and the doctrine of ss.lum as appliel to this case Is not sanctioned br the best precedents, and, when allowed, lends to encourage sedition and strife. Under no circumstances can the representatives of this g07.rnmcnl be per mitted under the Ill-defined fiction ot extra-territorial Jurisdiction to attempt the administra tion ot criminal Just co la the countries to which they are accredited A temperate de mand having been male by the Chilian govern ment for the correction ot this conduct tn the Instance mentioned, tho minister wa Instruct ed no longer to harbor tbe offenders The legislation of list year known as the Deary law, requiring the registration of all Chlneso laborers entitled to residence In the United Stales and the deportation cf all not com pi r lr.tr with' the provisions of the act within the time rrescrlbed, met wlta much opposition from Chlnamea la this country. Acting upon tho advice or eminent coursil that the law was unconstitutional, tho great mass ot the Chinese laborers, pending J dlclal Inquiry as to Us va lidity, In good falih declined to apply for tbe certificates required by Its provlilons. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought before tbe supreme court and on Miy 15, 1101, a decision was made by thai tribunal sustaining the law. It Is believed tbit under the recent amend menl of tbe act extending the time of registra tion, the Chlneso labircr thereto entitled, who desire to reside In this country will now avail themselves cf tin renewed privilege thus af forded ot establishing by liwful proceduro their right to remain and that thereby tbe ne cessity of enforced deportation may be to a great degree avoided It Is devolved upon the United States min ister at I'eliln. as dean of the diplomat! body and In the absence of a representative of Bweden and Nor.n to press upon the Chinese government reparation for the recent murder of Swedish mlsslonalres at Tung, but this ques tion Is of vital Interest to all countrlrs whose citizens engage lu missionary work lo tbe In terior Our relations with the French republlo con tlnuo to be lntlmato and cordial I sincerely hope that the extra lllou treatr with that country, as amended by the senate, will scon lie operatl a While occasional quest'oas affecting our naturalized citizens returning to the land of their blrlh have arisen In our Inter course with Germany our relations with that co ntry continue satisfactory.

Though Ihe speculator who stands wlih ex'ortlonate purpose between the land offlco and those who, with tbelr families, aro Invited by the government lo settle on the publlo lands.

T Is bail the effect ot limiting the operation o Ihe law to Its Intended purposos. The discovery having been made that many names bad been put upon the peuslon roll by means of wholesaleand glgantla frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of p-nslons wblch seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending complete examination, giving notice to the pensioners. In order that tber might have an opportunity to c abltsh.

Tbe report of the seeretsrr of agriculture will be found exceedingly Interesting, especial ly to that large part of ot our cltlzent Inti mately concerned In agricultural occupations. On tbe 9th day of March,IBl there were upon lu pay rolls 2,410 emplores. This numb-r bss been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted publlo treasury and tho Imp-ratlre demand of Ibe people for Ibe economy In the adminis tration of their government the secretary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing ex penditures b? eliminating from lto pay rolls all txTsontB not needed for an efficient con duct of the affairs of the department During the first quarter of the present year ins ex penses ot ihe department aggregated '3IV7178 against tl0.',91ii;for the corresponding p-rlod of tbe fiscal year ended June 3), 1-91. ino sec retary makes apparent ble Intention of continu ing this rate ot reduction by submitting estl- mites for the next fiscal year less by 991,3:0 than those for the present year. Among the heads of divisions In this depart ment the changes hare been exceedingly few. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations have been filled br tbe promotion of asttslmt In tho same dlrtalons. These pro motions of experienced and faithful assistants have not only been In fie Interest of efdclent work, but liaro suggested to those In tbe de parment who look for retention and promotion that merit and devotion todutr are their best reliance.

No contagious dlseasea were found among tbe Imported animals. Ibe total number of Inspections ot cattle for ex port during the past fiscal year was 81 1.511 The exports show a falling off ot about 2t per cent from Ihe preceding tear, tbe decrease occurring entirely In the last hrlfoftbe vesr This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to sn Increase In tbe price of Amer ican export cattle.

Wltb all these calls upon our navy It became necessary In order to make up a sufficient fleet, to patrol the Dehrlng sea under tbe modus Vivendi agreed upon with Oreat llrllsln to detail to that service one ves sel frcm the flsh commission and three from the 'evenue marina.

There have been delays la Ibe completion cf unarm- Lorrd vessels, but for tbe most part tbd; hive In the distribution of such dutlos and taxation ss the emergencies ot our government actually demand. Manlfestly.lt we are toatd the people directly through tariff reform, one of Its most obvloss features should be a reduction In present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. Tbe ben efits of such a reduction would bo palpable and substantially seen sad felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and bet ter sheltered. These gifts should be tbe willing benefseilons of a government whose blgbest function Is the promotion of the welfare of the neocle. Not less closely rels ted to our people's prosperity and well being is the removal of re strictions npon the Importation ot the raw ma terials necessary o our manufactures.

These new assess, ments are not only absolutely Just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable business disturbance whenever the necessity of their Imposition no longer exists.

It Is largely made up of a wearisome resumo of tbe reporuof his secretaries, which they have hardly Improved br condensation. Hprlnger, or Illinois, chairman of the last committee on ways and means, and of ths banking nd currency eommttlreof the present congress In reference to the tsrlff, the mes sate Is clesr snd forcible. In this 'be message will receive the cordial commendation ot every democrat In the land, and of many others who realize that our p-rsent proteotlvo system Is Injurious to tbe best Interests of tta people. la reference lo the cttrr ncy, Ibe president very hopefully sntlctpstes that a survey of tbe situation after publlo confidence Is restored will lead to a permanently sound currency. This view of thesubjectcxcludesdennlteiyand forever the lollcy ot a return to the alluring and temporary etpedlents ot slate banks ot Issue. The president Is evidently opposed to tbe repeal of the 10 per cent tax oa the circula tion ot stale banks. In reference to Hawaii, the president takes the only course consistent with Interna tlonat honor and comity. Holmau, of Indiana It la an able and forcible document. The earnest expectations of econ omy co.itraat strongly with the messages here tofore presented. Crearr, of Kentucky, chairman ot tho foreign affairs commttlee-It Is an ablo and appropriate document. It furnishes much valuable Infor mation. He presents our foreign affairs, mon etary matters and the tariff with great ability, and I think bis recommendations sre generally good. Oates, of Alabama-1 listened attentively. It abounds In details and Is full of Information about tbedepartments, but makes few rccom mends tlons. Dolltrer, of lows The message ts tn most respects formal. In he matters of publle In terest that are In dispute, tbe message lacks any satisfactory expression Ills views on ths tariff are well known and bis ardent support ot the proposed WUson bill surprises nobody. Chairman Wilton, of tbe ways and means committee The president's message Is all right He ts especially right on the tariff Cobb, of Mlssourl-I am hearlllf In accord with the message and Its conclusions. Tracey, of New York-I un satisfied with tt It Is a good message.

Dynum, ot Indiana, member ot the wars and means committee-It waa very eonclso but clear statement of the multitude of questions congress will be called upon to consider. Tbe principal views presented meet my unqualified appro vaL I am especially pleased with tbe tar1! question and the courageous manner the president came to the upport ot tbe commit tee, as tsrlff reform could i ot be accomplished without tbe support ot tbe administration. Mr Uoutellr, of Maine Ills the first execu live document wblch directly Impugned and charged malfeasance In ofnce and prac lcally treason upon a United States minister, against whom nothing was charged by tho admlaistra lion up to the tlmo his resignation was ac cepted. Payne, of New York, member of tbe ways sad means commltteo The message Is a re markably disappointing document. It tl main- ly devoted to a resume of tbe repirts of tho several departments, to which tbe president seldom adds an opinion ot his own Dlrrlay, ot Ma'bs, said- Tbe messa-jo Is vol uminous In Its resume of the details ot tbe work of tbe several govrnmento-, and weari some in Its capitulation of tbo smaller Inci dents of the -.Hairs, but on ono great foreign question. In wblch o ingress, aa well as Iho country, ought to know; -be exact situation, to wit: our relations with Hawaii Ibe message Is as silent aa the grave, beyond a repetition of the announcement made by Secretary Gresbam Hepburn, of Iowa The message Is a business paper devoted mainly to the buMnesa ot condensing tbe statements and recommenda tions ot the secretaries. Necessarily It Is tedious and dre try. Senator Voorbees In tbe mala the message Is a sound, strong document. I havo not exam. lned It critically and can not go Into details I ibtnk It will be well received by the country Senator MePherson It Is excellent all the way through. I was especially well pleased with tbe re ommendailo s with retard to ihe general finances and the tariff and as to the principles Involved In tbe tariff bill Senator Murphr It la a good fcessatre. Senate r Palmer-The president goes more Into detail than usual lth him. 'Ihe sugges tions are generally la Ihe line of dem)cr tla thought. Tho paragraph relating to Hiwall merely showed tbe president's Intention to take the qnestloa up again. I have no sp-elal objecllou to what he ears regarding pensions, but I have an idea Lis Impressions sre wide of tbe mark concerning fraudulent pensions. I d not know bow It Is among the colored ex- soldiers of the south, but my Information leads me to believe that In the north not 3 per cent of he pensions are fraudulent Senator Kyle There was nothing striking In the message, though tl contained some good points. Senator Morrill Ths president's Indorse ment of a tariff bill not yet acted o by the committee was very unexpected and remark able. Senator Hoar It Is a most remarksble mes sage la sev.-ml respects It treats the most Important questions feebly und briefly. Senator Mitchell, ot Oregon -I was very much surprised to learn from Jhs president's reference to Hawaii that the proposition ts re ally entertained ot restorlnj the queen. Tbe Wl'wn bill Iho president Indorses strikes a blow at the Industries ot the I'acltlo coast Senator Hale Tbe bill Is madn up of detail'. as t Hawaii, be leaves that to the tuture.
