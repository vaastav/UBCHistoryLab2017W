The annual message bf President Wilson will scarcely rank as a state -paper along side of some of his other messages. He spends a good deal of time in congratulating the democratic party on the legislation it has placed upou the statute books regardless of the faqt that a great many people are charging up the depression in business and money stringency to the legisla tion which he congratulates his party tor enacting. He devotes some time in his mes sage to tho question of building up our merchant marine and points out that this is an opportune time for this country to lay claim to South Ameri can trade. A man does not have to be much of a statesman to grasp this (act and reach the conclusion that there never lias been such an oppor tunity for the United States to secure control ot the South American trade OS at this very time, it has been our misfortune in the past to purchase the products of South America and pay c'iish tor them with which the people Of that country make their purchases in Europe. The opportunities for keep ing up tins practice are cut off to our Southern neighbors by the war which prevails in Europe and they naturally turn to the United States as a market in which to make their purchases. The question is, will we take advan tage of this opportunity and build up a trade with these countries? It is realized that this can be done by-increasing our merchant marine And Mr Wilson seems to favor this being done. Tho democratic party is 80 hostile to anything in the nature of subsidies that it is difficult to per suade it to offer inducements for men Of large means to put their money into ships to carry our produce into othar countries. If the experiment la'once tried the results will show the wisdom of so doing and the polit ical 'party that grasps the situation and acts promptly in the premises tflU win the applause of the American people. We sincerely hope that the democratic party will rise to the occa sion and take steps to secure the trade that is due us and will not per mit' it to be monopolized again by European nations. Thte President's message offers little encouragement for strengthening our means of defense. It is recognized by military men as well as civilians that our country is in a state of unpre paredness and that we couhl make bat feeble resistace to an assault from a foreign foe. Republicans in both the fcOMto and "senate have sought to have hkVtatigatlons made in order to as certain the exact position in which we ftfed Ourselves but the president with bis big stick is able to whip his demo cfitic followers into line andito have fated 'down a resolution offered in fUrttr of the investigation. It is ettttted by the president that our ttqntry would be tn a stronger posi tfali' tb intercede or intervene between ttfebelllgerent nations in Europe if jWA'tre not ourselves engaged in kifftnglhetting our means of defense. It. ta'.Mld that Germany has already in- Smated that she would not be inclin listen' to suggestions in favor of cessation of hostilities coming 1'rom tue^United States because of a feeling tijat the administration has disclosed a Itonihg in favor of'the allies. We '4q pot know what there is in support «t'ih}8 nC)alpi or suggestion but we ih&t the attitude of this country willnot prevent our being In a'posi tion to extend our friendly offices Stiring en the proper time comes toward peace between the nations now at war. p.-. ft THE 

PREVAILING WEATHER ."We do not know of anything which IS more pleasing to the merchants of Ugnison than the weather which pre vails, in this locality. The falling ^pow, which spreads over the western opuntrv, as well as the lowering bf. the temperature insures an increase in trade. Already there she• many evidences of an im provement in business. The farm *ira have their crops gathered and a better crop of corn has never been pro dliced in Crawford county, and, added io (his. is the fact that good prices prevail for the products of the farm. $!rom now on we predict with the till re deliveries of corn that money increase in circulation, which ikeans a larger trade for the merchant, '.fflttr a few months there has been such 4 tightening of the money market that tat few people were supplied with tfeeMis to purchase for cash, but now Wtlt plenty of corn to sell at good jprlcea every farmer should be well fW1" supplied with means to make his pur chases. The Denison stores are the best in the country and no better places can be fonnd for selecting up to date goods than in Denison. This accounts for the large number of people coining from other communities to Denison to trade. It is a frequent thing that one hears it said that Denison offers bet ter opportunities for purchases than other towns of its size in .Iowa. Another reason why the Denison merchants succeed is that they are good advertisers. They believe that they have stocks of goods that will stand investigation and they are will ing to have their stores visited and criticised because it insures large sales of goods. For the next few weeks our merchants should have a phe nomenal trade and we believe that, stocked up as they are, all previous records ol' sales will be broken this winte/. RECOLLECTIONS OF LINCOLN. The Ileview is under obligations to General Grenville M. Dodge, of Coun cil Bluffs, la. for tho book which he has recently published giving his per sonal recollections of Abraham Lin coln, General Grant and General Sherman. No one is better qualified to write concerning these distinguished char acters than General Dodge. As early as 1859 and from that time as long as they lived, Gqneral Dod.go was closely related to them by bonds of friendship as well as military and political ties. His personal acquaint ance with Abraham Lincoln began in the summer of lSGit at a time whenj Mr. Lincoln visited Council Bluffs on legal business and from that time un til the death of the president, lie sought, the counsel and advise of Gen ere! Dodge on numerous occasions. The time Mr. Lincoln visited Council Bluffs was noon after his joint, debate with Stephen A. Douglas in which Mr. Lincoln had laid the Inundation or his nominal ion and election 1o the presidency. He was requested to deliver a speech while at Council Bluffs and, although short notice was given of the meeting, lie was faced by splendid audience which was treated to a remarkable address. The book treats In an impartial man ner the history ot General Grant':', connection with the early events of the Civil war and discloses that Grant was a great general but a poor actor. He was little concerned about politics and was above maneuvering in order to win favors from his superiors, lie depended rather upon his ability to win victories from the enemy than up on personal efforts to impress him self upon his superiors. Notwith standing his remarkable success in winning the battles of Belmont, Ft. Henry and Ft. Donelson, his superiors and, especially General Halleck, in various ways sought to discredit him and oven to order his arrest. General Grant was .patient under all the mis treatment accorded him and bided his time depending upon the justice of his fellow countrymen for his vindi cation which carno in due time and with such unanimity that his critics were soon forgotten but his star rose higher and higher until the people with one accord proclaimed him as the greatest military genius develop ed in the civil war. He pictures Gen eral Grant not only great as a mili tary leader but as a statesman and cites a number of instances to prove the foresight of President Grant on legislative matters. General Dodge was a great admirer of William T. Sherman and believed that he possessed military qualities of the highest order and he gives to him great credit for the part he per formed in the Civil war. He traces his record from the battle of Shiioli to the close of the civil war and reaches the conclusion that General Sherman was second only to General Grant in military leadership. The people do not overlook the fact that General Dodge, himself, ranks along in character, ability and repu tation with Mie three great men whom he eulogizes in his book. When the war commenced he was a civil en gineer and was distinctively a self made man. His ability, however, was recognized by Mr. Lincoln before the war commenced and, notwithstanding lie was not a graduate of a military school, he was appointed to respons ible positions and never failed to make good in every duty imposed upou him. He was made a major general before the war was over mid he was a major general not only in name but iu size and enjoyed the full confidence of the other military leaders of the country. Since the Civil war ended he has de voted his time to engineering prob lems and financial matters with re markable success. He is the only major general whi survives the Civil war. While he has spent much of his time in New York where his business claimed his attention, iie lias never given up his legal residence at Coun cil Muffs, la. where lie is idolized by his neighbors as he is by the people of the state and country where lie, is best, known. We hope the years to come will deal gently with General Dodge and that he may be with us for a long time.
