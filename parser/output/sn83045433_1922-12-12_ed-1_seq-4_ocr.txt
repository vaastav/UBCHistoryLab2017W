DEWFIGHTFOR MINDRjTY RULE Proflrewve and Contervative Fotcm in Struggle to Con trol Democratic Pa/ty SEEK UHdERWOOD PUCE Simmons and Robinson Repre sent Conflicting Interests - Among Senatorial Groups Br JAMES R. NOUR8E, i Rhrwaal BsttIssw A fight is on batwMp progres sive and conservative Democrats in the Senate for the minority leadership, which is to be va cated at the end M the present Conjrress by Leader Oseac Under wood. Candidates are Joseph T. Rob inson of Arkansas, backed by the progressively inclined Senators; and Furnifold M. Simmons, repre sentative of the Democratic old jroard. , OF national concern. The contest between Robinson and Simmons is rapidly assuming pro portions of nation-wide Importance because of the probable effect the QmuH will have upon leadership of the party In the 1??4 struggle. Robinson led the Democratic fight against the Four-Power Treaty and the rest of the pacta agreed upon at the arms conference. He stands for a new order. He wants the party to adopt a truly progressive program. He believes in a virile and constructive leadership upon all national issues. 

SIPPORT OF HARRISON. Robinson has the active support of Senator Pat Harrison of Missis sippi. who also wants a new order in the party. Harrison believes that Wilson and Cyx and all the other pro-lcaguers have served their turn and failed* Inspired articles recently appear 'iig in publications friendly to the **ague of Nations Idea which pre set that Wilson will again assert feimself und assume to be the party leader have added spice to the Rob inson-Simmons contest. Some of llieae articles have even gone the i-ncth of asserting that Wilson's health is improving so rapidly that ht- might l>e the 1924 nominee him self. The progressive Democrats in the Senate do not desire such leadership. They are ready to bolt at the first opportunity any attempt on the part of the Wilson following to dictate to them on matters of Darty policy. It is unlikely that Wilson's friends in the Senate could swing enough votes either way to control the election of the new leader. TEN NEW MEMBERS. If the matter of Underwood's suc cessor were voted upon now. It is likely that Simmons would win. For this reason Robinson's supporters are demanding that the election be put over until the new Congress qon v-nes, contending that It is no more than right that the newly-eleced Democrats who are to sit In the Sixty-eighth Congress should be per mitted to vote upon the question. There will be ten new Democrats in the next Senate, as follows: Cope land, New Tork; Edwards. New Jersey; Bruce, Maryland; Neely, West Virginia; Wheeler. Montana; Ralston, Indiana; Mayfield, Texas; Dill. Washington; Ferris. Michigan, and Stephens. Mississippi. MANY PROGRESSIVES. Many of the Senators in this group will Join the progressive rmnks. In a contest between Robinson and Simmons, their votes would go to Robinson as the progressive candi date. Robinson's aides contend that it would be unfair to this large num ber of new Senators to have their leader chosen for them now by the , votes of Senators, many of whom are about to leave the Senate. It appears likely that the advo cates of postponement will win and there will be no selection of a leader until the new Congress comes in.

The Graham-Humea $500,000 alien ation case, which baa entered the fifth Week In Circuit Court No. 1 before Justice William Hltz. suf fered another setback yesterday when the Jury was dismissed short ly after noon In order that Attorney Wilton J. Lambert, counsel for Au gu^ine L. Humes, the defendant, ' Daniel Thew Wright, counsel for Lieut Lo rimer C. Graham. U. 8. N., the plaintiff, might argue on the validity of the marriage of the former Mrs. Elaa Portner Graham to Humn. The arguments and legal prece dents surroundlnig this marriage ?ere. "ot Interesting to the Jury, but they were expected to have an effect on the nature of the charge to be read by Justice Hitz after the closing arguments. When both attorneys had ex hausted their vocabulary on this particular subject. Justice Hltz stroked his chin and said, "Gen tlemen. I shall consider vour prayers prayerfully tonight and pr4bablv fleny them all in the morning " However, that may not happen, but the terse remark ended the pro ceedings until this morning at 10 o'clock. More rebuttal testimony was of Wright" the morniner by Attorney Mis? Agnes E. Entwisle, employe at the District government, whose office faced that of Graham when the Graham Lithographing Com pany was operating on Fourteenth street northwest below Pennsylva nia avenue, said: We could see them (meaning Graham and his wife) making love to each other. Mrs. Graham used to come to her husband's office quite often and we used'to watch them through the window. We thought, from their actions, that they were Just bride and groom. It was amusing to see them making love In plain view. A rigid cross-examination of 'his witness by Attorney Lambert failed to shake hex testimony which wns 5?r. to refute direct testimony which tended to show that no af fection existed between- the couple before the Reno divorce. Dr. Thomas E. Neale. a friend cf the Grahams, was called to the stand. He was asked by Attorney Wright about how the young cou ple conducted themselves when he first met thesn. Dr. Neale replied: "Like any other married couple Yes. they were affectionate." Dr. John Thomas Kelly, Jr.. who attended Mrs. Graham when her second child was horn, said that he failed to remember anything about the alleged refusal of Graham to allow his wife to have squabs, eggs, etc.. when she was recovering from her ordeal. Dr. Kelly also explained that he was the one who ordered Graham out of the sick room on that occa sion. The physic!* n was 'iu?* tloned about this Incident In order to refute testimony by Mrs. Gra ham that he^ husband was ?nJov. ing himself somewhere while she lay III. The case is not apt to reach the Itiry before tomorrow night or Thursday morning Attornev Wright declined to state who he would call to the witness stand thw morning. . n#>VpinnH pRrl< Rodents Get Better Car Service Residents of Cleveland Park, be g'nnlng yesterday, are receiving five-m nute trolley service bv the extension of the Navy Yard line of he Capital Traction Company, through Connecticut avenue.

It was alleged. Warner spat in his face, was acquitted of a charfte of assault yesterday when arraigned before Judge Hardlson In Polltfe Court. v Through Michael J. Colbert, his counsel. Moorman Interposed a plea of self-defense?claiming that War ner followed up the spitting by an abusive epithet and a challenge to fight. The two pistol shots which were fired ddttng the fight. Moor man said, were fired by him to frighten the colored man. who was just about ready to hurl a brick | fet him. Warner claimed that Moorman bumped him with an automobile which the clubman was backing out of the A. B. C. Motor Company's place at S17 Massachusetts avenue northwest. The colored man admit ted that he became angry with Moorman and spit on the windshield.

Moor man said that after striking Warner with the cane, the latter backed over to a tree box and picked up a brick and was about to throw It when he took his gun from his pocket and fired in the air. Right after this. It was testified, Warner got hold of the cane and beat Moorman about the body with It. To ward off this attack, Moorman said, he struck Warner with his fist and knocked him down, put ting a stop to the fkht. The pistol was knocked from Moorman's hani.

SUGGESTS HEW PLAi Would Have Districts Instead j Of States Cast Votes in ' Electoral College. The iuhmUod made In tha reso lution by Senator Non-U that the Electoral College be abolished and the President and- Vice President elected by direct vote of the people was endorsed yesterday by William Jennings Bryan, who spent Mwwl hours In >Wa0rincton op hip way tf ftaMa Mr Bryan also approved the provi sion in the Non-la resolution (or mov ing up the Inauguration of President and Vloe President and the ?im bling of Congress to the month of January Immediately following the election. 

SUGGESTS CHANGE. Mr. Bryan suggested ah important change, in the method of voting for Preoldent and Vice President, which was that the vote should be cast by Congressional districts Instead of by Stat**a He based hie sugg-stlon upon (be tact that the Congressional districts are supposed to be evenly balanced as to population, and thus the casting of the Presidential vote by districts would bring the result closer to the people. He said: "The change to electing the Presi dent and Vice President by direct vote would be of very little value If the election were to be controlled by Htates. The election by State* gives n very unfair advantage to the btz States In the Electoral College. The' change would become nearer to the people if the election were by Con trenslona] districts, each district to have one vote in the Electoral Col lege. If the vote were by districts. Instead of by States, it would not matter so much If The vote were cast for the candidates direct. Mr. Bryan heartily approved the suggestion made by President Hard n? In ha last message to Congreee for a conference of governors to bring about more strict enforcement of the prohibition law*. He said: 

BACKS DRY CONFERENCE. '1 think the President Was wise 'n suggesting such a conference Rut what we need most is a real ?mphatic protest sent by this nation 'o the nations which are In con spiracy with our bootleggers. The three-mile lmlit law was never In tended for outlaws. It was intended for legitimate protection of lefdtl niate shipping. One might as well *uy that pirates could onerate uga'nst our shipping out beyond the three-mile limit and we could not 'ouch them. This Government should protest to the other govern ments of the world and make It ntaln that we do not respect the three-mile limit when It operates far the protection of boose."
