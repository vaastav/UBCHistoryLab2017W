In the President's War Message, delivered before the two Houses of Congress April 2,1917, President Wilson referred with great strength and feeling to "the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia." * At the present momeht the happenings of the lust few weeks in Russia are disastrous and disheartening in the extreme. But none the less these recent happenings emphasize the truth of the principle the President laid down in the message in the sentences just preceding his reference to Russia. It is not by the aid of Germany as no'w ruled, or by a German peace that freedom, justice and peace are to come to Russia. Doubtless the sanity of the Russian people makes this plain to them and out of the ruinous chaos of today their sober second tnougnt win Dring tnem once more to the side of free peoples fighting for the freedom of all peoples. The President's words were as follows: "A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations. No autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants. It must be a league of honor, a partnership of opinion. Intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan v/hat they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart. Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honour steady to a common end and prefer the interests of man Kina 10 any narrow interest or their own." Christmas Draws Near. There are a large number of people who are anxiously awaiting and counting the days until December 25th, Christmas, the greatest holiday of them all. To the little folks the Christmas tide is the most wonderful time. From the frozen North where Kris Kringle makes his annual pilgrimages by sleigh .and reindeer, to the Sunny South, where he is obliged to take to the airplane on account of the scarcity of snow, eager hearts are waiting while sleepy eyes are watching for his appearance. men tnere is the home-coifling and the home-going, which stirs in the hearts of the older ones, s! rong emotions. The signs displayed on many of the store doors, "No Sugar" somewhat dampens the ardor of many, but then they will enjoy themselves anyway, eveh if there is nothing butN molasses for the old folks' coffee. The young people always have a big time on Christmas and the old foiks enjoy the dav too, for in addition to the enjoyment and happiness which they see about them, memory j has a strange way of fluttering the leaves of individual history back to some never-to-be-forgotten occasion over which they love to linger. The Preisdent's Message., In his last war message to the j world President Wilson has maue a new precedent in defining the aims which the allies hope to realize. Not a conquest for gain, for territory or for emoluments for any country, but for the good of all mankind. That men all over the world shall be free and when no nation shall again be thrown into conflict to gratify the greed or ambition of any man but when peace, justice liberty and democracy shall reign. D Aa spokesman for the allies and as an aftermath to the www un ih mm an doi flgbtini for the ruin of their enemies* but for the remove! of the safeooratk power which chain* them to the conflict Hot that they shall be deapoiled but rather that they be made free. That the weaker nations have the same freedom as their more powerful neighbors and forever be immune from their attacks. Could there be a loftier ideal for* a nation to fight fori?Sumter herald. Blease Heard Freat Again. Former Governor Blease has written a letter to V. B. Cheshire in which he savs he will be a candidate for United States senate if his friends want him to be a candidate. He states, however, that if the election machinery is to remain in the hands of the same smooth gang that stole the election last year, there is very little encouragement for any man to spend his time and money running in the primary. He argues that the Reformers who are in the majority at the polls must take charge of the election machinery as they have a right to do and as they are able to do. Mr. Blease states in his letter that there is to be a meeting of the Reform Democrats in Columbia in January for the purpose of considering the situation. ? Yorkville Enquirer.
