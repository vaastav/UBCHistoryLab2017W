the mails at the office of delivery , mm! to charge the sumo tii his account, to be deducted from bis commissions. It in believed that by these two provisions a large amount of revenue now lost will be Kav.nl to the dopartmeut. naval minus. It is suggested for the consideration of Congress, whether the privilege, by tho act of tho lato session, con ferrod upon soldiers, to Rend letters without prepayment of postage, should not bo extended to s:illoi s and marines in thr actual service of the United states, under such regu latious ua tho department shall provide. MAIL CABRIKH'S FIE. By the act approved March 8, 1426 (section 20) , it is provided that a malt carrier shall ret eive and deliver for mailing at the next office any letter delivered to lnm for that purpose more than a mile from such office, ilo is entitled for such carriage to demand and receive one cent from tho postmaster for this service. Under tin prepayment system now adopted, this provipiun should be amended so as to allow him to demand tin* fee of the writer, in money, and of tho postmaster only when tho loiter shall bear a prepaid stamp fur cue cent additional to tho postage. NBWSI'APEKS. By tho existing law (scction 10 of act approved March 8,1845), " nouspapors" are declared to embrace printed matter issued by numbers, and published monthly, and aro entitled to the sain a privilege of freo exchanges and low rntos of postage us daily and weekly newspapers en joy. It is aacei'taiut d that this classiticntlon is abased by the publication of monthly issues of printed matter chiefly designed as an advertising circular, or to procure free exchanges for the proprietor, and they are often tout gratuitously. I recommend that the dellnition of a nowspaper a3 given by that act, be amended by substituting the words, published nt short staled intervals of not more than one week, for tho words, '? published at short stated inter vals of not more th&u "no month. " Also, that the privi lege of free exchango of publieations be limited to news papers as thus defined, and literary, educational or reli gious periodicals published not less frequently than once a month. It is found that considerable frauds aro perpetrated upon the revenues of tho department, by publishers of newspaiiers, who include, miugiod with th>i packages sent to their regular siibscribem, numbers of tlioir Issues which are not sent to their regular subscribers, and which are, therefore, subject to postage as trans. cut matter. To remedy this evil I recotnmond that discretion he given to the head of this department to exclude, tempo ral lly , from the mails nay news; aper or periodical whose proprietors or ugon is shall send any of their issues wilti onl projiayment of postage to othjr than 6on? Jid>: nub Bciibers; or, otherwise, that an express penalty be im posed tor such act. 00?nitSt*i0Mjii. post iiornn. It is frequently found expedient, in cctmoclion with tho progress of railroad communications or changes of princi pal transportation ro;tes, to cbaiiijo the termini of Con gressional mail route.; intersecting them. 1 suggest, for the oonsid<!i'atl"n of Congress, tho pro priety ot expressly authorizing this department to chango the to. mini and lint s of Congress!' r.al mail routes inter aecttng principal routes on which the mails are carried daily, whenever tho postal service can bo theroby im proved. ADDITIONAL MAILABLE MATTt.'t. The twelfth section of the act of 1S61 declares sundry additions to matter which may be sent through the mails. Various applications have been made to Include othor )iko matter, not expressly named therein, as mailable matter. It is suggested whether it would not ho expedio it to invent ibo department with the discretion to ailow such other matter to be transmitted through the mails, at corresponding rates of postage, rb the Post master General shall by order designate and allow. The public convenience and the revenues of tho department would derive benefit from such discretionary power. CARRIKR'8 KKK. I renew the recommendation of my predecessor, that power be given to tho department to regulate tho car rier's fee, not exceeding the amount of two ccnts for tho delivery of <.aoh lotter. It cannot bo sustained lit somo of the cities and districts without an increased rat#, bo long as it is discretionary with the party addressed to employ the services of the carrier or not, no just reason >8 perceived why the former discretion should not be given lor tho purpose of facilitating so import act a brand' of the postal service. IjRANUI OKFlr.tS. Requests have been made from several cities for the establishment of brunch offices for tho receipt and do livery of li tters auxiliary to the city Post ORice. 1 lru. e boon unwilling to establish them without some provl l<n being mado to meet the additional expense, for whicu i lie same foo allowed to oarriers, one cent, would be siiiE cient. By tho law authorizing their establishment (lbt7, chapter 03, sec. 10) no charge is permitted for this addi tional service. I respectfully suggest, for the considera tion of Congress, tho propriety of amending that law and of granting this authority; and also of investing this dc Ktment with tho authority to erect in any city b >x-pil for the receipt of letters to be mailed, to b>; thence collected by carriers, for which the fee of one ccnt each letter shall bo prepaid by stamps. C WIFirATIOH OF POSTAL LAWS. A revised code of the postal laws, bringing together in proper arrangement the various statutes now gathered only by tho examination of the legislation of many years, would greatly facilitate the performance of their duties by the numerous o:licers and agents atta^ lied to this de partment. This subject is respectfully commended to tho attention of Congress. RAILROAD SERVICP. In the la.",t annual report of my predecessor mention is mado of tho refusal or neglect ol a large number of rail road companies engaged il the conveyance of mails to execute the contracts required by law of all contractors for the performance of their duties. Tills abuse continues. When a railroad is constructed through a district of Oountry, competition in the conveyance of passengers, mails and mo: than liso rouses on the route. Demand is immediately made tor (ho mails, aud without reference to the importance of the olliocs to be supplied, at a compen sation m'.ich above that previously paid for coach nud horse service. Increased speed is tho only ad vantage which tho service gains, although with respect to private business this is invariably accom panied with a great reduction of cost. Tho subject demands attention from Congress, and that mea sures bo adopted to enable tbe government to contract on fair terms with lli ac companies. The existing rates of compensation are iu my judgment too high, and even at such rates tho government is at tbe mercy of the com panies. The government has the power to compel them to carry tho mails at fair ratts, us it has the right to tho use of all private property necessary for its purposes, upon making Just compensation ; anil provision sh ield be made to resort to this power when fair arrangements cannot bo made by way oi con ti act. This would enable the department to deal with the companies on equal terms. CT1ANGE OF CONTRACTS FOR DISH.0VA1.TY. Soon after t tie commcucomont of my term of ofllco tho country felt the sho^k of internecine arms. In view of tho great crime ntt'-mpted against tho existenco of tho nation , it became tho duty of this, in common with tho other departments of the government, to put forth all its Anergics to prevent tho consummation of that crime. By tbe existing laws all pot masters and mail carriers, anil nil other persons cngiifcd in handling the malls of tho United States, or in clerical service, wero required to tako the usual oath of allegiance to this govoiument, ob well as for tho faithful performance of their duties. Whenever it was made apparent by their declarations, or by their conduct, that thero was a practical re pudiation cf tho obligation of this oath, whether the party was a postmaster or a postal contractor, I ordered a rcmovlfl from olllce In tho one case and the deprivation of contract in the other. Not only woe it unsafe to intrust the transportation of tho malls to a per son who rofuscd or failed to rccogniso the sanctions of an ?ath, but to continuo payment of public money to the enemies of tho government and their allies, was to give direct aid and comfort to treason in arms. 1 could not thus permit this branch of government to contrlbuto to its own overthrow. No other courso could have reusona- I bly been expected by such contractors. The bona Jile observanco of that oath, aud tho duty of allegiance i itself, entered into anil became a condition, a part of tho consideration, of tho contract itself. This failing, the department was equitably and legally discharged from its literal obligations. Protection on the part of government, and alleglence on the part of tho citizen, are correlative, and arc conditions mutually depen lent In every contract, and the highest public interest demanded the rigid enforcement of this rulo of action. Occasional local and transient incon venience resulted of necessity, but far lets than would reasonably have been expected. Loyal men, everywhere, sustained this action, and speedily furnished the requisite means for continuing tho sorvico without increased ex pense. Theiso changes wero mainly called for in parts of Virginia and Maryland, and in Kentucky and Missouri. In iuo same and m neighboring districts, the duties of th ? appointment olllco have been very onerous from the great number of changes required in post offices according to changing phases of public senti ment, individual action, aud military occupancy. It is believed that these |Kisitions, with rare exceptions, aro now held by men of unquestioned loyalty. Where such men could not be found, tbe offices have been discon tinued ratlior than they should be held by repudiutors of public faith, and us d for purposes hostile to the per petuity of our national institutions. DISLOYAL PUBLICATIONS EXCLUDED FROM THE MAIIit. This department was also called upon to act upon another question, alike novel and important Vari ous newspapers, having more or less influence within tho si here of their circulation, woro represented to be, and wero in fact, devoting their columns tn tho fur therance of the schemes or oir national enemies. These eflbrts were persistently directed to the advancement of hostile interests, to thwart tlio efforts made to preserve tho integrity of tho Union, and to accomplish tho results of open treason without incurring its judicial penalties. To await the rosults of slow judicial prosecution was to allow crime to be consumatod, with tho expectation of subse quent punishment, instead of preventing its accomplish ment by prompt and diroct interference. The f'roedom of the press is secured by a high constitu tional sanction. Rut it is freedom and not .'icense that is guaranteed. It is to bo used only for lawful purposes. It cannot aim blows at tho existence of the government, tho constitution and the onion, nud at the same titne claim Its protection. As well could the assassin strike bis blow at human life, it the Siimu time claiming that ins victim ebotild not commit a breach of tho peace by a counter blow. While, therefore, this department neither enjoyed nor claimed the power t'i suppress such treasonable pub lications, but left them frco to publish what they pleased, it could not be called u poo to give them circulation. Jt could not and would not interfere with tho freedom se?jred Tiy law, but It could and did obstruct the dissemination cif that license which was without the pale ol tho eoasti tutionond law. Tbe inaUs established by !!>e I t. it u States government could not, apon au> kuowi princii of law or public right, be t'or its destruction A well could tho common carrier tie legolly required to transport a machine designed for th<? destruction of tb? ?vehicle conveying it, or an Innkeeper be compelled to en tertain a traveller whom Ji ? 'uk w to bo Intending to com lnit a robbery In his ho". ? I ilnd these v ie?.a supported by the itigh authority of tho latoJiHtice Story, of the S'ipf.'m# Court of the I'nited States. Qe says in i-n imenting on that clause of the constitution re, urlug tho freedom of the preffs:? ' That this amendment was intended to cure to on ory rfti^-n ati absolute ri^ht to speak, or write, or print what soever ho mi>ht. please, without nny responsibility/ imblic er private therefor, id a supposition too wild to be Indulged in by any rational man. This would be to allow to every citizen the right to destroy itt bis pleasure the reputnlion, the |ieace, the property, and even th- per Bonal safety, of every other citizen. A inan might, out of mere malice or revenge, accuse another of the in< st infamous crimes; might excite agaln6t bim the indigna tiuu ( f all his fellow citizens by the most atrocious calum nies; might disturb, nay, overturn all his domestic pence and embitter his parental iiflecti ms; might inllict the most distressing punishments upon the weak, the timid and the innocont; mluht prejudice all a man's civil and political and private rights, and might stir up sedi tion, rebellion and treason, even against the government itself, iu the wantonnou of bis passions or the corruption of Ins heart. Civil society could not go on under such circumstances. Men would then be obliged to resort to private vengeance to make up the deficiency of the law; and assassinations and savn^o cruellies would bo perpetrated with all the frequency belonging to barbarous and cruel communities. It is plain, then, that the lan guage of this amendment imports no mare than that every man has a right lo spoak, write and print his jpiulons uj.oii any subject whatever, without any prior restraint, so always that he does not injure any other peiS'n in his rights, person, property or reputation; and so always that ho does not thereby disturb tbu public peace, or attempt to subvert the government." Of the cases presented for my action, upon the princi pies above named, 1 have, liy order exclvded from the mailt twelve of these treasonable publications, of which s .'Veral h id been previously presented by tlic grand jury as incendiary and li'istilo to constitutional nrtkority. 1 have the honor to be , Ae. , your obedient servant, M.

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL. TmmPDAY, Dec. 5?6 P. M. Money grows more abundant day by day. Bank ers and brokers refuse to allow over three percent for money deposited with them, and many houses decline to receive money at any rate of interest. Still the street brokers generally pay 0 per cent for loans on stocks. First class paper passes easily at 5 a 5% per cent, and names which till lately were not current except at very high rates can now be passed at 7 a 8 per cent. It does not seem to have been remarked that the distinct pledges contained in the President's Message and the reports of the departments, with regard to the recovery of Southern debts due to loyal creditors, Impart a new value to paper which has been in very low repute here since the war broke out. Congress will proba bly at this session provide a means for the recovery of these debts, and thus a large portion of what is generally considered "dead paper" by our banks may turn out more valuable than is supposed Quite a large number of Southern debtors would pay what they owe but for fear of the despotism under which they live. The consciences of the more dishonest debtors will have to be quickened by our troops. Nothing is doing in exchange to-day. Some leading bankers cling to the belief that rates mnst advance and specie flow out. It is abundantly evident that, even if their views are correct, the flow of spocie could not prove so heavy as to in convenience the banks: there is no such demand for bills as could cause a weekly shipment of over a quarter of a million. We could spare twenty millions to advantage. Stocks Were quiet to-day. Business remains dull, operators generally being anxious to hear from England and to read the report of the Secre tary of the Treasury before buying. Virginia sixes rose 1 percent; Missonris were steady. The move ment in the railway shares was irregular. Galena rost %, Rock Island %, Michigan guaranteed %; while, on the other ban 1, Erie declined %, Hudson %, Harlem preferred %, Reading %, Michigan Central %, Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien%, Cen tral, Harlcni old Panama, Illinois Central, Toledo and Burling on were without change. The market was dull at the ?lose, the following being the last quotations:? United States 6's, registered, 1881, 89% a 90; do. 6'p, coupon, 1881, 93 a 93%; do. 6's, 1874, 82% a 83; Indiana 5's, 75 a 79; Virginia 6's' 48% a 48%; Tennessee 6's, 40% a 41%; North Carolina 6's, 60 a 61; Missouri 6's, 40 a 40%; Pacific Mail, 85 a 85%; New York Central, 77% a 77%; Erie, 31 a 31%; do. preferred, 52% a 52%; Hudson River, 30% a 37; Harlem, 11% a 12; do. preferred, 29% a 29%; Reading, 34 a 34%; Michi gan Central, 47% a 48; Michigan Southern ni,?l Northern Indiana, 17% a 17%; do. guaranteed, 36% a 36%; Panama, 110 a 111; IlliuoisCentr.il, 60% a 60%; Galena and Chicago, 70% a 70 Cleveland and Toledo, 32% a 32%; Chicago a,;u Rock Island, 52% a 52%; Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, 57 a 58; Delaware, Lackawana and Western, 05 a 70; Milwaukee and Prairie iu Chien, 18% a 19; Illinois Central bonds, 7's, 87% a 88; Delaware and Hudson Canal, 81 a 83; Pennsyl vania Coal, 78 a 80. The National Hank Note Company arc printing the bonds for the last United States loan of $50,000,000. They will be registered bone's of $1,000, $-),000 and $10,000, and coupon bond? with scrai-anniiul coupons attached, of the denomina tions of $500 and $1,000, having twenty years to run. The coupon bonds are to be protected t > the peculiar tint work patented by the National L. :ik Note Company, which has proved such an effectual safeguard against counterfeiting, and which has been adopted by a number of banks wl se notes, made by the old combination of engravers, have been successfully counterfeited of late. .This new contrivance, by multiplying the name of the insti tution and denomination of the note many times, prevents alteration, while the difficulty of copying the intricate work defeats the art of the hand en" graver, and the introduction of various colors proves an insurmountable obstacle to tie photo grapher. It is well known that the United States demand notes are of that cx< eedinely black, heavy, coarse style of work which has beon so successfully counterfeited of late, and it would be well for the govern mcntto procureanew sctof plates, with tie 1at< s* improvements, in anticipation ol the discovery of counterfeits. The first instalment ol the second batch of 7.30 notes will go on to Washington to" morrow. The company has already transmitted to Washington about $29,000,000 of demand notes, $19,000,000 of which Mr. Chase is believed to have issued. Mr. John A. Stevens, President of the Bank of Commerce, is in Washington, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Stevens is popularly supposed to be in favor of a national bank of issue, whose notes shall be a legal tender; such a bank to be, if required, a bank of deposit, but on no account a bank of discount. The pub lic were disappointed to-day at not receiving the report of the Secretary of the Treasury; it will not be ready until Saturday, and it is probable that the New York public may not be enabled to read it before Monday or Tuesday. When the Secreta ry was here a few days ago, he stated to friends that he had not determined upon a financial policy. He knew, when he said this, that it would be necessary to adopt gome new policy, as the re sources of the associated banks can hardly enable them to shoulder more than perhaps $100,000,000 beyond what they have taken already. The public have relieved them of some $10,000,000 of 7.30 notes, and the popular subscriptions continue fair: but it is idle to disguise the fact thn* they do not supply money as fast as it is needed by the govern ment, or as fast as it should be supplied in order to enable the banks to place fifty millions to the ?credit of the Treasury Department every sixty or ninety (lays. There are many who believe that the difficulty will be overcome by authorizing a further is?-ue of say $200,000,000 of United States note*, beating no interest, and creating them a legal ten di'i The public is fully prepared for something of ?',(> Wind, and, so long as the government pro ? steB the war with vigor and energy, and people are allowed to hope that the rebellign will t,? t s peedily and thoroughly crushed out, almost any t quantity of government paper will be received with i AMcrity and floated for an indefinite period. The Sob-Treasurer has called upon the banks for j another instalment of ten per cent on the secont) fifty million loan. When this is paid, ninety per cent of tho whole loan will have been drawn bv the Sub-Treasurers, and the associated banks will have $5? ,000,000 to the credit of government. The following was the business of the Sub-Treasury to day:? RecoiptS $766,840 8?j ? For customs 85 .COO 0^ ?
