The meseage deals with but one subject but to bread* winners that subject is the all impor tant one. The President slates clearly and forcibly the case of the people against the monopolists and for the sake of the country it is to be hoped that his admonitions will not fall upon deaf ears. The I’nited States Supreme Court on Monday decided the Kansas pro hibition law to be constitutional. Justice Harlan, who del.vered the opinion, said that “the State had a right to prohibit the liquor traffic; it •lid not thereby take away the pro perty of the brewers, it simply abated a nuisance.” A caucus of the democrat aof the Virginia Legislature on 1 hursday night, unanimously nominated Hon. John S. Harbour for Inited States Senator to succeed Senator Hiddle berger from March Ith, l s V*. A nomination is e juivalent to an elec tion. The recent Maryland Farmers' Con vention adopted the report and lax | bill to be presente 1 to the Legislature, submitted by c -pedal committee charged with the work. The taxation [ of mortgages is one ot the chiet points in the hill. That provision requires the mortgagee to pay upon the amount of his mortgage, and the balance is assessed to the mortgagor. It may he set down to the credit of the Cleveland Administration that up to October Ist no less than 4i,bt* >, *94 a'Tes have been lestoted to the public domain, irom railroads, and other cor porations (hat had secured them ille gally under Republican rule, and proceedings have been instituted for the restoration of more than nine millions more. 1 hese restored lands, in the aggregate lour times greater - than the area of Maryland, and nearly equal to that of Pennsylvania, will now be thrown open to bona tide settlers. The New York Star says the call for the Republican National Conven tion is a formal notice to all who do not believe in the doctrine of high protective monopoly to leave the lie publican party. None others are wanted to join National Committee man Howell Clayton and his associates in the support of Blame. No anti nionopolists need apply for Republi can electoral ballots. The reduction of the Republican torces to the num ber of out and out, thick and thin Blame monopoly men will greatiy simplify f he political situation ot ISS**, The Peoi i e with Him.—The Prov idence i li.

Mr. Wash bum further says that “it is an out rage upon the people ol America that the two political parlies should b struggling to make political capital out of such an economic question as the tariff when the danger of finan cial contraction is threatening the country.

Messrs Editors:—The opening of Congress, the meeting of the National Republican Committee, and the an nual session of the American Evangel ical Alliance have contributed to tender the past week a memorable one in the history of Washington. The Associated Press dispatches furnished a graphic representation of the scenes at the Capitol upon the opening day of the swision, out they convey but a poor idea of the keen sense of disap {•ointment felt by the crowds that rilled the galleries long before the hour of opening, who anticipated witnessing exciting and animated proceedings. The questions with reference to the seating of certain Senators had been amicably arranged in joint caucus held during the morning, and as no emergency arose, those who had struggled to get into the crowded galleries, hardly felt recompensed for their pains. The opening scenes in the House of Representatives were not unlike those attending the opening day ot a session. The doors of the galleries were thrown open at an early hour, and soon every seat was oc cupied and the corridors were crowded. There was an unusually large atten dance of ladies. The lloral gifts to l the Members were both numerous and • beautiful. Here, however, as in the Senate, the spectators who had ex pected to witness an unusually excit ing opening were disappointed. The only excitement was occasioned by a religious crank in the main gallery, who, as the roll was about to be called, arose and in a loud voice requested all present to Join him in singing the old and famili r hymn “Praise God from Whom all Blessings Flow, ’ and, waving bis hands he proceeded losing at the top of his voice. The gallery was so crowded that it was impossible for the officers to reach him until he had finished the song. After the : election of officers of the House, the ! diawing for seats was commenced. It was highly amusing to watch the expressions upon the faces of some of the unfortunate members as the best seats were selected before their names were called. The President created a decided sensation by sending to Congress the shortest annual message ever written and by devoting it entirely to a single subject. The reading of the message was listened to with marked attention by both M mbers and spectators, and the subject of the message and its probable effect upon the coming Pres ' idenlial contest has been the theme of discussion during the week. The more timid Democrats are apprehen sive as to its effect, while the Repub licans claim that the message will enhance the strength of their party in the manufacturing districts. What ever the effect may be, it is generally f conceded that the message will prove , the foundation ct the coming Presi dential contest. The Evangelical Alliance, which commenced its session at the Congre , galional Church on Wednesday, at tracted to the city a large number of prominent church workers from all sections of the country. The sessions Lave been extremely interesting and so largely attended that it was found necessary to hold overflow meetings 1 in other churches. Prof. Boyeson, who is a naturalized citizen of the I’nited States, lead a paper before the Alliance on Thursday evening upon the subject of “Immigration,” 'which has attracted universal and wide , spread attention. He pointed out the evils arising from unrestricted im migration, and ihe disastrous conse quences sure to follow. When an intelligent foreigner, who allies his 1 interests with ours, informs us that it is time to throw obstacles in the way of pauper immigration, we tnav well take heed, T..e National Republican Committee at its session at the Arlington Hotel on Thursday last, listened to the claim- presented by the several cities and finally decided upon Chicago as the place and the iHth of Tune the date for bolding the Nominating Con vention. The meeting of the com mittee was an interesting one, and all the members processed to entertain I the brightest hopes for ;be future. jTbefntnds of Mr. Biaine Lad full control, and it is now Socked upon as a certainty that he will again make the race with Mr. Cleveland. Mr. Biaire’a prompt comments upon the President's Message arc also consider ed as a significant indication cf h.s intentions. Now that Mr. Sparks has ceased to hold the office of of it General Land Office, a good story u' jr told as having occurred oaring h i recent administration. A report was received at the Department last year from a man in Montana, stating that upon many of the streams in the Ter ritory quantities of timber had been cut down and was lying indtoctimi- I j nately about upon the ground white) it Lad been left to rot, while a email | proportion of the trees only weie used in building houses and dams. A special agent was at once sent all the ■ way to Montana to investigate the matter, who, upon inquiry, was in formed that the damage was entirely , the work of the beavers, y one of the old families in Montana). The Com missioner decided that it would hardly be wise to institute suit for damages and so the matter dropped. 11. —- - Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, but to insure this you j should call at the Big Brown Store and buy your Christmas presents.
