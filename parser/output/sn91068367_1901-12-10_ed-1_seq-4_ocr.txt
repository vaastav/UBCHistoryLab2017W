LORD BYROX'S PROSE AXD POETRY There lire two elaborate editions of the works of Lord Byron appearing in - England. Both editions are carefully edited by literary men of distinction. They have" been appearing for some year or so. "We have seen neither edi tion, but they are praised by cpmpe- - . tent English critics. The one we would be particularly glad "to have and to hold," Is edited by Roland E. Prothero, formerly a fellow of Oxford University, and with sundry degrees conferred. - The sixth volume is not yet the end. We think six are required to contain the "Letters and Journals" alone of the eminent poet. There are two vol umes of poetry yet to come. Byron was one of the most interesting and consummate masters of letter writing who have lived in any age or country. We recall that in the forties, while at the University of Xorth Carolina, we .r?ad with consuming interest the life of the poet by Tom Moore, the gifted, mellifluous Irish bard. He published a goodly number of letters from the poet and they were full of personal charm and literary cleverness. The new vol- - ume referred to contains, as we learn, some hundred letters that have never been printed before, 'ihis will prove to be of genuine Interest to the true ' Byronic admirer. "We do not know who "is the chief reviewer for the New York Tribune, but he is scholarly, able, in dependent, and gifted with mental health and literary sincerity. He writes as he thinks and he thinks well. His insight ordinarily is excellent and his taste admirable. Reviewing the last of Byron's letters in the Murray edition we are noticing, he begins in this wise: "There could be no better testimony to the enduring fascination of Byron's correspondence than the feeling of fe i.:et which arises on reaching the end of It in the definitive edition of the 1 poet's writings. One would willingly have the letters go on indefinitely. But v'nee, even, with the substantial addi tions made by Mr. Murray, we must be content with six volumes of them, we have at least one consolation; every one of them can be read, and re-read, and re-read again. That is one sign of the Immortal quality in Byron. For many Tears he suffered a neglect per haps more apparent than real (he has never, of course, been without a large public), but of late it has seemed as if he were being more widely read than ver; and we believe that as this new edition of him makes him bttter and better known the prophecy or Matthew Arnold will be more than fulfilled." Mr. Arnold, a great English critic and essayist equalled but by few prophe sied that Byron would again be real by lovere of high literature would1 come to his own again. The Tribune critic thinks the letters so fine that they "must be inevitably a great help In making the verse better understood-" If you will read Byron's letters his prose you will see the accomplishments of superb intellect, and that they com pare well with the supposed writers of greatest success in letter writing with Cowper, Horace, Walpole. Fitzgerald, - . and others in England, and with the most famous letter writers in France. V The effort to pooh-hooh Byron made by a few prominent critics in the past has failed. That great 1 critic in the first quarter bf the last' century. William Hazlitt, wrote most dispairingly of Byron, and even abused and under rated him scandalously. But the Byronic candle was not to expire under such hostile attacks. "Within a few years a well known Victorian critic. Professor George Saintsbury, in his use ful work on the "Literature of the Nineteenth Century" vigorously attacks him, and seeks to reduce him if pos . sible to a rather indifferent poet. But .'all this fails. , Byron was indeed a writer of splendid gifts, and his best poetry has upon It the stamp of en durance, and will be read when his assailants are well nigh forgotten or are remembered because of their vitu perative, caustic criticism of one of the most masculine poets in the great vol ume of English literature. Byron was a lover himself of great literature. He had wide reading. The Tribune writer says that "of the wide scope and Interesting character of his reading," that it "ranged from Plato to Horace "Walpole. from Song of Solomen to Voltaire. Judging from the number Of quotations indicated. R would appear that his three favorite authors, in the order named, were Shakespeare, Scott and Pope." Now little fellows who are image breakers and character smash- . ers deride Scott and think him but a -"sounding brass and a tinkling cym baL" A carefully prepared volume or two qf selections from Byron's poetical flrorks would furnish the fastidious and moral reader with much of the noblest and most splendid poetry in the rich "literature of Great Britain. The -German author who is placed above all the poets of his country, right or wrong, ; and who is magnified into such extreme greatness by admirers, placing - him Trithv Homer Dante and above Mil ton, Goethe, had great admiration for Byron and wrote much concerning him. He had 'acuter discernment and higher appreciation, pt sreat poetry, than Haz litt, Saintsbury, and the recent coterie of disparagers who would reduce him to the intellectual dimensions of Long fellow and Bryant and Kipling: Did you ever read that unique and original little bock b- Andrew Lang, he calls "Letters to Dead Authors." He has a poetic epistle addressed to Lord Byron. The volume first appeared in 1S86. It contains a keen rebuke to Swinburne, a really very gifted poet, but a soured and unequal critic, who made a savage assauli on Byron mak ing him a pretender and a fraud. Lang has acuteness of understanding and wields a facile and keen critical blade. "We make an extract that Is brilliant and engaging. Writing mind you, to Byron, who died in 1824, sixty-two years before Lang wrote his epistle, he says: "I was saying That half our English Bards are turned Reviewers, And Arnold was discussing and assay ing The weight and value of that work of yours. Examining and testing it and weighing. And vowed the gems are pure, the gold endures. While Swinburne cries with exceeding joy The stones are paste and half the gold alloy. In Byron Arnold finds the greatest force. Poetic in this later age of ours. His song a torrent from a mountain source. Clear as crystal, singing with the showers. Sweeps to the sea -in unrestricted course Through banks o'erhung with rocks and sweet with flowers , None of your brooks that modestly me ander. But swift as Awe along the Pass of Brander." The gifted Scotsman himself a poet, essayist, critic, historian, novelist and biographer continues as he glances to the close of this prolific century: "And when our country has clomb its crest, And backward gazes o'er the plains of Time And counts its harvest, yours is still the best' etc. Lang pours a hot shot into Swin burne and other foes, and say that "o'er the Eagle thus the Bantam crows." He refers to the appreciation of Byron in Europe, and writes: "The Germans, too. those men of blood and iron. Of all our poets chiefly swear by Byron." The epistle closes with touching lines: "Farewell! thou Titan fairer than the gods! Farewell, farewell, thou swift and lovely spirit. Thou splendid warrior with the world at odds, Unpraised, unpraisable. beyond thy merit; Chased, like Orestes, by the furies' rods. Like him at leneth thy peace dost thou Inherit. Beholding whom, men think how fairer far Than all the steadfast stars the wan dering star-" Some other time we will undertake to show in what Byron's great gifts as a poet consisted. fiLBAMXU AXD COMMENT. Representative Crumbacker, of Indi ana, is very warm in the collar just now. He is extremely anxious to re duce southern representation in the congress. He says two-thirds of the re publicans already favor an action and he expects enough will be found to deal with the south. His aim is to punish the whites in all southern states that have dared to disfranchise Mose and Josh. His heart warms toward them. Although he knows his party committed a great crime against sense, honesty, decency, justice and right, when they enfranchised 4.000.000 of ignorant, illit erate, superstitious blacks, and that but few of them after thirty-six years are fitted to exercise tht right' to vote with intelligence and safety to the states, he Is vet anxious in the black ness of his heart to punish the whites who dare to apply tests to their quali fications to vote. He Js a! bitter parti san and negrophilist and an enemy to the white race in the south. The south will not be ruled by Ignorant negroes and ten thousand Crumbackers cannot bring it about. Some of the best newspapers consid er the president's message as excessive ly long, as verbose. It fatigues the mind to carry all the points and confus ion may follow. There is a want of definite recommendations say some. A stirring point made is to compell the trusts to give publicity to their opera tions. He says: "What further reme dies are needed in the way of govern mental regulation- or (taxation can onlv be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and In the course of administration." The word "taxation" he uses is explained by the New York Evening Post in this way: "Mr. Roosevelt, as governor of New York, caused the franchise-tax law to be passed, and that he said in one of his messages to the state legisla ture that if all other remedies for trusts and combines failed, that of taxation remained There is no other word half so dreadful to the promoters of trusts as the word taxation, because that is something which they cannot buy off. When the public mind is once fixed upon it, lobbyists and party bosses are pow erless to divert the lawmakers from it." A A A While republican senators and re publican representatives and. herhaps, a republican president, wish the trusts to continue in unrestrained sweep and vigor, there is a sign in the political heavens that the star-gazers in the old wicked party might look fcipon. At Lew iston. Me., a few days ago there met the National Grange, as it is called. It drove a few nails in the subsidy coffin. It said in a resolution in denunciation of the big scheme to rob the people: "We have reasons founded on sound princi ples of statesmanship to oppose a scheme that contributes to the profits of the few at the expense of the many, without adequate return. The tolling farmers of the land have . developed American agriculture until Its products constitute a majority of the exports, without government aid, and we under stand that American steamships are al ready yielding their owners profits in transporting these and other products to all parts of the world, without gov ernment subsidies. The farmers of the country ask for no special - favors in legislation, and oppose in the most vig orous manner such special favors to shipbuilders and owners, as are embod ied In what is familiarly known as the ship-subsidy bill." That is sound, sensible, positive and to the point. The paternal government is too paternal. It should quit or go out of that business. What hits the subsidy scheme hits also the greater trust robberies perpetrated under, im proper, special, discriminating legisla tion. Kill the trusts and smother the subsidy game of plunder. v Divorce laws generally In all the states are bad, unrighteous, vicious laws. They demoralize and curse. In Providence, Rhode Island, the land of money and superior education, there are 6S7 cases, for divorce. In Washington City there are 300 cases. This shows how the curse widens. It is as infec tious as scarlet fever or Yellow Jack. The law of God is forgotten by legisla tors who forget and ignore him. A A A S l V When Americans have had an oppor tunity, like the British, they have car ried their "institutions" with them cards, drinks, etc. But when they turn ed up in the Philippines they found that "drinks" were no where. The na tive have a drink called, "vino," and it is a long way ahead of American whis key, even when drugged. The natives imbibe, but it leads to insanity and crime. Its use by the American soldiers plays havoc and is now made a military offence. General Bell, out there, has is sued an order, from which we copy as follows, showing the capability of Fili pino vino in its results: "Acute Insanity, frequently resulting in death within a few days. "Many cases of serious disability, ne cessitating discharge on sargeorf's certi ficte of disability. Large numbers of grave crimes, in cluding murder and rape, necessitating frequent trials and punishments, thus depriving the government of servjee due it "Many abusive outrages committed to the discredit of the United States and of Americans." The ministers in Atlanta belonging to the Evangelical Association, held their monthly meeting and discussed the cig arette question. It was the opinion of several ministers that "the cigarette was doing more harm than whiskey, as it led to whiskey and everything else that was low and degraring." A com mittee was appointed to confer with the committee from the senate. AAA Georgia like North dis cussing the "greatest man" that state has had. A well known lady of talents says it was Robt.Toombs. Another wirt er thinks it was George Michael Troup. He says of his eminent and able man of the past: "Governor Troup was the essence of principle in everything he did. He hated the word compromise and policy when a principle was involv ed. All of his letters and speeches bristled with principle. He never went on political crutches and prated about what other men said or did. His mind was far too original for that, and self reliant." AAA That means very much and we like it. It is not infrequent that public men now hobble around on crutches, and some carry two a republican populist crutch, or a democratic-republican crutch No man should be trusted for an hour who cannot walk upright with out any crutch and . no hobbling or wobbling. Tombs was indeed a great man. and we have been more impressed as to his supreme abilities than any other Georgian who has come under our observing eye for a half century. The evidence to showUhatrDr. Craw ford Long, of Georgia, 'was the real, first discoverer of surgical paresthesia has-been published many, years to the country. But the Yankees have got the honor and thus robbed the south of an important honor. Everybody ought to know who Dr. Marion Sims Is a na tive of South Carolina, and the great est genius in surgery this country has ever seeni .He wrote in 1S77, in a little pamphlet, as follows: "The state of Georgia will, at no distant day, erect at the national and at its capitol or its university a statue of Long, who was unquestionably the discoverer of surgi cal anesthesia." He stated "that Long was the first man to intentionally pro duce anesthesia for surgical operations, and that this was done with sulphuric ether In 1S42. That Long did not by accident hit upon it, but that he rea soned it out in a philosophical and log ical manner, x "That Wells, without any knowledge of Long's discovery, demon strated, in the same philosophic way, the principle of anesthesia by the use of nitrous oxide gas in 1844." We get the extracts from a recent communica tion in the Atlanta Journal. A A A German is an important customer of the United States. It Is known that it is engaged in the constructing of a new tariff that will operate to the disadvan tage of this country, when we can not comdain if it Is done. A high Chinese wall arrangement called a high pro tective tariff is just as proper for Ger many as for the United States. In cne vear this country exported 5134,000,000 to Germany. That is greater than is shipped to any other country except Great Britain. orv rather to embrace more, the United Kingdom. What was shipped is divided as follows: Bread stuffs, $32,000,000; cotton, 564,000,000; meats, 520,000,000; tobacco, 53. 000.000; oil cake and oil cake meal. 54,000,000; fruits and nuts. 52.000.000. It is supposed that Germany will not tax cotton but the cereals, etc. i 4s , Mr. Dooley Is rich on "Anglo-Americans." He wields & cautlc pen, and knows how to be sarcastic about King Edward's British subjects in New York. He reviews the recent banquet at the chamber of -commerce. It will be re called that Secretary Hay "orated" and he "palavered feelingly and bloomingly. Mr! Dooley touches him up gently In the following neat condensation of his speech: "Feilow-subjicks, says th Sicrety iv state, 'diplomacy is a far dif Treat business thin it used to be. (A voire.
