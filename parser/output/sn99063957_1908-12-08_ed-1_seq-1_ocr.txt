Chamborlaln answered tho various objections that havo been urged against national control and pointed nut numerous Instances of difficulties Utndant upon the control of nation al resources Vy tho defendant states. "I would not for a moment bo un derstood as claiming that congress had any purpose to disturb right which bftYO bn Invested through the national or statr laws." he said, nut, on the otrary, I lusht 4hat uch rlrVi1 would be promoted by the "ourte here sugge'ted."
