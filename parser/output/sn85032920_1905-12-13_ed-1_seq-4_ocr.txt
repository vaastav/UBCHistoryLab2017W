Very little surprise need be felt at the attitude adopted to wards joint statehood by President Roosevelt, as outlined in his message to Congress yesterday. The people of Arizona have for some time been cognizant of the fact that the President has been under tnc mesmeric influence 01 senator uevendge on the ques tion, but it was hoped that the enormous volume of evidence ten dered by Arizona against the "unspeakable crime" of jointure would have been instrumental in removing the spell ere the message to Congress had been written, and that the entire matter would have been left to the good judgment of the senate and legislature. But no. In that self-assertive and pedantic style for which Pre sident Roosevelt has made himself famous he announces that 'There is no justification for further delay, and the advisability of making the four territories into two states has been clearly estab lished." This positive attitude is a shock, indeed, and came to Qu.r people yesterday as a,lIo;v for iich they were in no wise prepared; It is auite evident from the President's announcement that' he has subjected whatever personal opinions he may have held on the subject to a promise given Senator Beveridge two years ago. to the effect that he would help the Indiana legislator in his fight for jointure. It therefore seems that he would help perpetrate an unspeakable wrong on the people of Arizona merely because he felt himself bound by an undertaking given before he had had any definite or reliable data upon which to base an honest and just judgment. This peculiar feature in President Rosevelt's character has been productive of some extraordinary anomalies, and we in Arizona are painfully aware of the lengths to which this blind eyed worship of the supposed ideal has often led him. We have had inflicted upon us in federal and territorial offices men at once incap able, inexperienced, many of them grossly ignorant, and destitute of qualifications, their only claim to any consideration being that they had served in the ranks of the Rough Riders, and had only done their duty as thousands of other citizens had done. In short, the President subordinates everything to a fetich, and comparative goodness or capacity count for but very little when he bestows his patronage. This attribute of President Roosevelt makes his pronuncia mento on joint statehood all the more galling and unjust. Con sideration for the people of Arizona and New Mexico is entirely absent in the President's blunt and dictatorial statement. His re commendation for jointure must go to Congress merely because he has given a promise. The happiness and well-being of thousands of our people, and of their children's children stands imperilled just because the cursory investigation and visit paid the territories by Senator Beveridge must be justified and the opinions formed by the Indianan must be upheld! Truly this is injustice of the basest and most despicable kind, a treachery that nothing can palli ate, and probably without equal in the annals of American history. For it cannot be contended that the President has not had the other side of the question fully and often presented to him. Several deputations of the best citizens of Arizona and New Mexico have visited Washington and acquainted Mr. Roosevelt with the full facts in connection with jointure. Hundreds of communications have been sent him from people in the territories fully qualified to speak with authority on the matter. The whole subject has been threshed out over and over again in Congress, and the press has given unlimited space to its discussion. It cannot therefore, be said that the President acted without a full knowledge of what he was doing end of what the. possible effect might be. The President says that the "advisability for making the four territories into two states has been clearly established." Per haps, but only in the minds of himself and Senator Beveridge. whose extraordinary bitterness , to Arizona and its people has often been marvelled at. We have never yet seen the ghost of a case made out for jointure in fact, the only argument in its favor is that it would preserve the equilibrium in the Senate! And for this dastardly and brutally selfish reason we arc to have our iden tity wiped out, to be swallowed up in the maw of New Mexico, and to remain for all time political nobodies, our rights stolen from us, and our best interests at the mercy of a gang of office-hunters and grafting politicians ! The cause of Arizona, however, is not yet lost. The President's self-assertive and autocratic utterances and opinions have often fe upon the deaf ears of our legislators, and we sincerely hope that in this case the House will do justice to the territories, and refuse to give assent to such an unparalleled and atrocious outrage as joint ure would involve. We are strengthened in this belief by the re cent visit of the Congressional deputation to our midst, and also by visits from several individual Congressmen. These gentlemen, af ter having made a thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the whole question, confessed that there was no excuse for joining New Mexico and Arizona together in unwilling bonds, and many of them confessed that, while they had previously concurred in and voted with Senator Beveridge on this question, they would from henceforth be diametrically opposed to the jointure scheme, and also that they would use their best influence in Senate and Congress to prevent any measure of joint statehood from becoming law. This gives us renewed hope, but the fight, without doubt, will be waged without mercy in the present Congress, and the friends of Arizona both at home and in Washington will need all the help and succor possible. It is useless, we believe, to further parley with President Roosevelt. His recommendation has gone forth and, like Caesar, no power in heaven or in hell can change it. He seems impervious to any sense of justice, and utterly regardless of the consequences of his action. We believe in the justice of Con gress, however, and hope and pray that jointure may be relegated to oblivion and that, as a free, enlightened, wealthy and progressive territory we may ultimately receive that measure of justice which is our due, for which we have striven so long and honorably to make ourselves worthy, and which, we firmly believe, in spite of the President's recommendation, must ultimately come. After his utterances of Tuesday, the President's previous high- sounding declarations of a square deal for everybody must be re garded as a fantasy of the brain. Henceforth, he must be considered as a Dr. Tekyll in precept and a Mr. Hvde in practice. OUR 

ATTITUDE COMMENDED. in x (From Friday's Daily.) Judging by the expressions of opinion heard on all sides Prescott yesterday, the stand taken by the Journal-Miner in its criticism in yesterday's editorial of the unjust and ungenerous atti tude adopted by President Roosevelt towards Arizona meets with the hearty and whole-souled approval of our citizens. A continuous stream of callers poured into the Journal-Miner office from an early hour yesterday, the usual edition of the paper being.quickly exhaust ed. It became necessary during the course of the day to print large extra edition of the Journal-Miner, the papers being required by our citizens to send to friends in Washington and the east. Every caller at this office, without exception, expressed hearty ap proval of the sentiments as voiced by this newspaper on the state hood question, and more particularly regarding the atrocious at tempt which has Deen, is being, and will be made in the present Congress tolink us in an unholy. and. repulsive union with New Mexico. From all parts of Arizona'" come' like expressions of opinion and it seems to us the territory has been aroused to a greater de gree through the President's unworthy suggestion to Congress than has ever previously been the case. While this is gratifying, there is no time for delay in organizing all our forces for a final and conclusive fight against ioint statehood. Everything that can possibly be done must be done in order to stave off and defeat the joint statehood bill. It is quite certain that Senator Bever- dge, with the cunning and perspicacity for which he is famous, has already planned a coup de gras tor this territory, and we be- ieve that, if his efforts are to be defeated, we must concentrate our forces, and make one last grind stand. Concentration is our watchword. Surely, with the evidence of a people united in one common cause, and declaring with no unmistakable voice "We will not have it," the Congress of the United States, sent to-Washington by the common people to legislate for the common welfare, will lesitate, even at the behest of Roosevelt and Beveridge, to impose upon people who do not want it the galling yoke of joint statehood. Can our people stand idly by, and have their liberties filched from them in such a barefaced and unconscionable manner? Do the people of Arizona fully realize what jointure with New Mexico means? Will they be content to have all their business transact ed in a language and by a people with whom they never will have anything in common? Are the people of Arizona satisfied to be wallowed up, obliterated from the realm of political affairs, bound hand and foot, and all their grand and heroic efforts in the building of our territory swept aside forever? We say No, a thousand times, No ! This great crime must not take place. We want it distinctly understood that in this matter of joint statehood, and indeed in all other matters, that the policy of the Journal-Miner will be directed towards the welfare of Arizona rst and always. We are not among those who believe that the king can do no wrong." President Roosevelt, by the great injus tice which he has done toward Arizona, is deserving of the severest criticism. He seems, judging by his message of yesterday, to re gard with feelings of contempt the universal and often-expressed wishes of the people of Arizona regarding joint statehood. Ac cording to Mr. Roosevelt, Arizona is incapable of knowing what is good for the territory, and is undeserving of a voice in the decision of its fate. He brushes the territories aside in his peculiarly dic tatorial manner, and in blunt and cold-blooded language recom mends what would amount to the complete extinction of Arizona as a political entity. Party loyalty must always fail to support such a burden. The thief that would come to the house of a citi zen and rob him of all he possessed would deserve and receive con dign punishment. But this jointure proposition is thievery on a colossal scale, and thievery in as culpable a form as any of which we can conceive. Let the people of Arizona awaken to the enormity of the issue and the magnitude of the fight before them. We have good friends in Congress, but will need them all in the coming battle. It will not do to sit still in the present crisis. Action is necessary, and we would here and now urge on our political leaders of all phases of opinion to concentrate and organize the anti-joint state hood forces of our people into an overpowering and irresistible avalanche that Congress must and shall obey.
