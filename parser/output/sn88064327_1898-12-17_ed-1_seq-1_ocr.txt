The best review of tile late elections that we have seen is that of S. S. Field, of Baltimore, lie writes from the point of view of a party Democrat, but never theless with knowledge and sense. Mr. Field is not surprised at tho election of a Republican Congress. That, lie says, was to have been expected, since the war with Spain was carried to a successful conclu sion under a Kopul.lican administration ; for "in any movement which succeeds, poople do not stop to inquire into tho merits of the various persons engaged in it. all their praise accrues to tho leader." And he credits with patriotic disinterested ness the Democrats in Congress who, when they "forced the war upon McKinley, knew it would probably result in the election of a Republican Congress this fall, and they stood for right rather than party expediency." But Mr. Field finds, nevertheless, that the Chicago platform Democrats have much reason to congratu late themselves upon the election. IIo believes them to be in a stronger position than ever before. "To begin with," says Mr. Field, "tho gold Democratic party no longer exists. In the Fast ils leaders havo returned to the regular party, hoping to control it ; in tho South and West, where there is no such hope, tho leaders have gone over to tho Kepublicans. Only three Chicago platform Senators aro lost, while one is gained, but the gold Democrats have lust six anil have but two left. Yet 20 Demo cratie Senators were opposed to free coin age at lötolonly four years ago. And though the Kepublicans have gained i majority of 9 in the Senate, 13 Kepubli cans retire two years hence who repre sent States that will be carried by the Democrats if the Democrats are at all si ccessfnl. Thus the control of the Sen ate under a Democratic administration is more than possible. Similar encourage ment is derived from the make up of the lowerhouse. On State issues Democrats were largely defeated ; on Chicago plat form issues they were notably successful ; while the overwhelming Republican ma jority is cut down to almost nothing." "Three fourths of the Democratic gains in the llonse," says Mr. Field, "are Chicago platform men, while five of the eight losses in the Senate are gold Democrats." Mr, Field is encouraged by this condition be cause it suggests a united democracy in 1900, along tho lines of the Chicago plat form for an aggresive instead of a defen sive fight, lie is responsible also for a further very significant comparison. It, is of tho elections of 1894 and those of IK98. In 1804, under the leadership of the gold democratic elements, the democrats lost 8 seats in the senate and 113 in tho house ; butin 1898, under the leadership of Chi cago platform men, though they lost 8 in the senate, 5 of these were gold democrats, 8nd they gained 41 iu the house, three fourths of whom stand on tho Chicago platform.— The Public. nons riiis; We offer One Hundred Dollars Reward for any case of Catarrh that cannot be cured by Hall'e Catarrh Cure.

Hall's Family Pills are the best. Had Christ not preached equality among men, had he not sought to establish Christian communion, he would never have been crucified. For tho same rea sons his apostles suffered martyrdom. They were never molested for their style of worship. Invariably they were charged as disturbers, anarchists and haters of mankind. Wherever you find a period of martyrdom it has been not a religious per secution. but an economic persecution in stituted by political agents. Every Old Testament prophet was a political agita tor. The multitude is leaving the church to-day not becaune it is bocoming less re ligions, but because it is becoming more religious. Thero was never a time when the heart of mankind called more clearly for a definite, tangible faith. There was never si much unorganized material for martyrdom, Men an.l women are waiting for the call that shall summon tlieinto give their lives for their brethren, not concerned in the mere saving of their souls Prof. George I>.

S|M. Few words are mon» often used . lev j are so often abused II' n m m lie morel' j a mnssbiiek, he is regarded us :i type o ! conservatism ; Jie may so regard himself j It aman lie a mere blatant demagogue, wi I are apt to 11 him a radical, and im mai rejoice in I he e|>il hot Referring to these two words, IheKa. , Francisco Sim makes this di timtmii I II fit a radical "is a man who seeks Iii» (right, and having convinced himself, i j consequently outspoken in doing what In j believes is l ight. t hough all the world I"' j side were against him ; whereas, a con servative ' is a pusillanimous erealure afraid of his own shadow, nev er out j or candid This distinction ,1, seem to us to lie satisl'acloi \ A radical is one who seeks the root of things, who tries to bring political comli tions into harmony with fuiulatimnlul principles; while a conservative is one who adheres to I he existing order l 'pou reflection, we shall learn that both are no cessary to human progress. True progress is doubtless toward ailap tation lo fundamental principles. The radical, therefore, would be progressive, il lie were not human and liable lo err. Bill he is human, and lie does err. I'I'len what seem to the radical to lie Iii -1 pi In ciples, are no principles al all All un consciously, instead of being progressive, he is retrogressive. It is this fact that makes the conserva tivo mind as important a factm in pro gress as the radical, flinging to the ex isting order, tho conservative does iu truth obstruct progress, but he also ami most effectively obstructs retrogression. Like the pawl to the raehol wheel, con servatism secures tho advance thai radi calism makes The radical mind constantly seeks changes. It is the discontented mind l;i physics, it invents new machines and methods. In politics it urges on lo belter social conditions. Though radicalsmay in their ignorance drift far away from I rue radicalism, they never become mossbacks. They always want change, aro always restless, are always in search of the holy grail of first principles. Left to itself, this restless type of mind might as well carry the world backward as forward. Deceived by appearances, it might turn iu its tracks and imperil the very advances it had made. But the conservative mind prevents that. There is more power in truth than in falsehood. Consequently, when radical tendencies are backward, conservatism, resistance to change, is apt to be effect ive ; but when radical tendencies are for ward, conservatism, though it makes much friction, much difficulty, it is ulti mately ineffective. Radical energy, turned by the inertia of conservatism in the right direction, is iu the long run ir resistible. These two forces bporating iu the great mind of human society, like the centrifu gal and centripetal forces iu physical na ture, establish equilibrium and promote permanent progress. Where conservatism is most stubborn, radicalism is most hardy. For an c\ ample of tho more wholesome radicalism we shall turn not to France, where con servatism is weak, but to Knglaud, where It is strong.— The I'nblie. Tetter, Halt-l{/irum ami Kczeinii.

THE BURDEN OF FRANCE. The anxious attention of French states men and economist is being directed to the onerous burden of taxation, coupled with the small annual increase in popti Intion, which are the dominating features of the France of to day. The inelasticity of the revenue is a standing notice to min isters of finance that the limit of tax pay ing power has been reached, if, indeed, it has not been already passed ; while tho almost stationary population, as contrast oil with the steady growth of the millions he yoml the Ithiue, tends to diminish Ihe relative military strength of the republic. A h a matter of fact, the twin phenomena we havo mentioned constitute a menace to the national defence, graver by far than any real or supposed blabbing of secrets that may occur wilhin the mysterious pre cincts of the general staff. The French national debt has steadily grown front the early years of the century, until it now amounts to more than .f5,0()li, 000,000, and the budget of |H!I8 allocates more than $250,000,000 to the payment of principal and interest. This item of tin budget now absorbs ltd 1 2 per cent of the annual revenue of the treasury. If we take the total taxation annually exacted from the French people, we find that it amounts to almost $1100,000,000, after deducting about $05,000,000 for receipts from tho telegraph, the postoflice, receipts from tho telegraph, the postoflice, and other non-fiscal sources. The City of Paris alone collects a revenue of $70, 000,000,and the 1(0,000 communes absorb nearly $200,000,000 more.— T. D.

Kx Premier Uoseborry says: "The taxation of ground values is a principle which will not lie al lowed to die until it has been carried into effect. It is u principle which is beeom ing universally established, because it lias been acknowledged to he both just and sound." .lohn Morely says: "I cannot doubt that tho principle involved in what is called the question of ground values is one which must make quicker and quieket way into the minds and opinions of Ilm people. It will be thought an intolerable thing thai men should derive enormous increments of income from the growth of towns to which they have contributed nothing thai they shall he able to go on throttling towns, as they are well known to do.

Worst of all the president's reeointnen dations in his message is that for a four fold increase of the standing army. This is something which Kuropoan experienei and our own traditions warn us against Large standing armies afford opportunities at critical moments for suppressing popn lar movements and putting dangerous men on horseback. One is needed by us for no other purpose. What we lacked iu tht Spanish war, for example, was not an army, but supplies for the army. And wi should not have been lacking in that re sped if the president had appointed West Point graduates instead of civilians with a "pull," to places of military authority If we havo a large standing army it will itch for a chance to practice, and in default of foreign foes will practice upon the pen pleat home.
