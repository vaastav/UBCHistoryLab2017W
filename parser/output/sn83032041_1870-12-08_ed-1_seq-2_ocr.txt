ZIEOLEK, Pres't P. OK AT MEEK, Sac' j. . A Constitutional Convention. Ox Satardaj week last a epecial election was held io the Raleigh. (North Carolina) district, to supply a vacancy caused by the death of JohnT.Pawces, Radical. Mannlog, the Democratic candidate, was elected over Ilolden, Radical, by about 600 rnajuity. Holden is a sod of the present Radical Gov ernor of the State. The election of Manning is another Democratic gaio. "Tij Tats.'' The first Dumber of a new Democratic daily newspaper called The Paper was issued In Pittsburgh on the 1st inst. We have a copy of it before u. It is a nir.e column sheet and is therefore of the largest size. Its mechanical execution is of the very highet-t order, and the whole paper presents a decidedly winning and ele gant appearance. Its editorial department displays first class ability and will secure for it a front rank among the leading Dem ocratic papers of the country. We welcome Hit Paper to our exchange list as an able and influential auxiliary in tbe good cause. Os Tuesday, the 29th of last month, the Legislature of North Carolina elected Ex Governor Zebulon B. Yence, Democrat, Uni ted States Senator, as the successor of J. C. Abbott, the present carpet-bag incumbent. Mr. Vance is a native of his State and was at one time a prominent representative in Congress. This is the beginning of the dis appearance from the Senate of a class of un known and incompetent men who reached high public station immediately after the collapse of the rebellion. When the politi cal cauldron boiled, the scum was sure to rise to the surface. A more auspicious day has now arrived. Okk Mo&b. To the list of the surviving members of the Reform Convention cf 1838, which appeared in this paper two weeks ago, the editor of the Indiana Democrat adds the name of Walter Craig, of Washing ton county, and Samuel A. Gilmore, now President Judge of the Fayette and Greene district. If Mr. Craig is living the Editor's addition to our list is so far correct. Samuel A. Gilmore, however, was not a member of that convention, as the Editor will readily ditcover by glancing over the signatures of the delegates, which are appended to the Constitution. At that time Judge Gilmore resided in Butler, where he was born, but the delegate from that county was Samuel A. Pu'viance, who is now a member of the Pittsburg Bar, and whore name appeared on the list as published by us. The Nkw York Would. We call the attention of our readers to the prospectus of this great, leading and influential Demo cratic organ, which will be found in another column. It is entirely unnecessary for us to enlarge upon the great merits of the World as a newspaper. It has a world wide reputation and is confessed on all hands to display more enterprise, energy and ability in its management than any other journal of either party in the United Stales. It is. established on a firm and permanent basis and bids fair id the future to surpass all its great achievements in the past. The induce ments which it holds out for the formation of clubs are of the roost liberal character and ought to commend themselves to the favorable consideration of the Democracy in very section of the country. Mr. Morrell Declines to Contest. The letter which we publish below was addressed to a gentleman in Huntingdon and appeared in last week's Journal of that place. It will be seen that Mr. Morrell de clines contesting Mr. Speer's seat in Con gress. The letter is written in very good taste, and reflects credit on its author. His allusion to "scattered fraudulent votes, over one hundred of which have been reported to me," (Morrell,) is merely the usual plea urged by almost every defeated Radical can didate for Congress, whether the majority against him is five, or Jive hundred. Mr. Morrell, however, perfectly understands the cause of his defeat, and frankly acknowledges it when he says that he is "fully satisfied that my (his) drfeat is due to the base treach ery and debauchery of professed Republi cans." Although this plain language is not at all complircetitary to the party of "great moral ideas,' it is nevertheless true, and is specially intended for the benefit of Senator John Scott's own county. Although Mr. Morrell's political friends will doubtless re gret to part with him, we cannot refrain frcjn congratulating him, that the people of the district seem to cave anticipated his cherished desire, and have kindly afforded him an e xcellsnt opportunity "to get out of public life" r JonjfSTOw., Pa., Nov. 18,1870. JJt Deai Sib : Yours of the l?tb is re ceived. I am sorry to disappoint mv iracy good and true friends in and out of the district, by declining to contest the seat with Mr. Speer, bnt justice to isysell requires it- Uy Laming op the scattered fraudulent votes, rer one hundred of which have been reported to me. I could doubtless xoska a successful contest, bet being fully satisfied that my de feat indeed anjibiDg abort of 1200 majority iu the district is due to the base treachery and debanchery of yrof cased Republicans.

MORRELL. Since the October election the newspaper press of both pol ilical parties has been en gaged in discussing the question of holding a Convention for the purpose of altering and amending the Constitution of the State. As waa to be expected, a project of such vital importance to the future welfare of the people has many warm and enthusiastic ad vocates, and not a few bitter and determined opponents. The friends, however, of the proposed convention, so far as we can gather from our exchanges, seem Jo be greatly in the preponderance. It is now thirty-two years since the present Constitution was adopted by a popular vote, and although it was a vast improvement on the Constitution of 1790. a strong impression has been made on tbe public mind, that still further changes in the organic law are imperatively demanded for the certain and absolute preservation of the threatened rights of the people. We have long been impressed with the propriety of holding such a convention, and the shame less results of every session of the Legislature have more and more coufirmed our convic tions of its necessity. Unless some strong and defensive barriers are interposed between tbe people and the assumed omnipotence of the Legislature, the rights of person and of property in our State will all be gradually absorbed by the legislative branch of the government, and will exist ouly iu name. The great and growing evil of the present day is a surfeit of legislation, but particu larly of special legislation, aad it is of this feature in our legislation, more than any thing else, that the people so loudly com plain, and which has caused them to look to a Constitutional Convention as their only source of relief. Our annual ponderous vol ume of tbe Acts of Assembly is an eloquent commentary on tbe wisdom of the man who said that "tbe world is governed too much." There are many other subjects of great im portance that would naturally present them selves to the convention for its delibetate action, one of which would be the mannei of electing a State Treasurer. We cannot. however, go into details on that or any of the other questions, which would necessarily force themselves cn the convention for its ultimate decision. Assuming, then, that popular sentiment is in favor of holding a convention, the did. cult question presents itself, how shall its membeis be elected 1 On tbis subject there exists a great conflict of cpiniou. It is per fectly self-evident that a Constitutional Con vention should not be a partisan body, but an assembly or convocation of men repre senting and acting for the entire body of the people, and not merely for the interests and advantage of anj-one political party. This narrow and contracted view of the high functions of such a convention would sink the project into deserved contempt, and ought therefoie to meet with no countenance. If the party in power will insist that the members of tbe convention shall be elected under tho Senatorial and Representative ap portionment bill of 1864, we are unalterably opposed to the whole scheme. That was the most unjust and infamous apportionment that ever disgraced the Legislature of tbe State. It is difficult to see how the majority that voted for it can escape the charge of moral perjury. Under its gerrymandering provisions, several certain and reliable Dem ocratic counties were unnaturally attached to adjoining Radical counties giving larger majorities, and their political influence was thus neutralized and destroyed. In Phila delphia, entitled to eighteen members of the House, and where parties are nearly equally divided, the districts were so formed as to prevent the Democratic party from electing more than five, or, at the most, six of the whole number. No honest man would ad vocate that bill as the basis on which to elect delegates to a Constitutional Convention. Both the political parties ought to be as nearly equally represented in the convention as possible, ihis was tbe complexion ot tho convention that framed the present Con stitution of New Jersey in 1843, and the result was that it was almost unanimously ratified by the people of that State. A sim ilar arrangement could be easily effected in Pennsylvania and with the Fame harmonious result. We arc therefore in favor of a con. vention constituted on such a basis, or one similar to it, that will have a due regard to the numerical strength of parties. This is a question purely for the Legislature. If it is approached in a proper spirit, free from the low and scurvy tricks of the political dema gogue, and if a fair and equitable arrange ment of the districts is made, the labors of the convention will receive tbe endorsement of the people. On the other hand, if it Bhould degenerate into a purely party movement and with ulterior party purposes in view, its work will meet with certain and deserved popular condemnation. one of their best men. All personal aspira tions and factional divisions have been sunk by that party, and Colonel Robert P. Dechert, has been made their standard bearer. He is a gallant soldier, and a gentleman of ability and culture, and of blameless private character. He entered the army as Sergeant Major of the Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Kegiment, under Col. John K. Murphy, on tbe first of July, 1861, and shared the fortunes -of our gallant army until July i 7, lb65, when the regiment was mustered out of the service. He partici pated in the campaign of General Banks in the Reus and Political Items. The Union town Standard, the organ of the Republican party in Fayette county, asserts that "Democracy and Catholicism are a joint stock concern." A white girl of Conestoga Centre, Lan caster county, has just assisted in replenish ing tbe earth by giving birth to a mulatto baby one of the fruits of social equality. For over thirty yeara an old gentleman i at St. Albans, t., haa made a practice of sshenandoih Valley in the spring of 1862. and j getting out of bed every night at 12. 2 and was at Cedar Mountain, second Bull Hun. and all the battles in front of Washington, in the disastrous campaign of Pope. He won epecial distinction for his gallantry at Antietam, Chan cellorsville and Gettysburg, and then was transferred under Hooker to Chattanooga. He became Assistant Adjutant General on the staff of General S locum, and with him served in the memorable march to Atlanta, and thence to the sea. Be was at infeivals promoted Lieutenant, Captain, Major. Lieutenant Colo, nel for "gallantry and other meritorious ser vices," and after the victory over rebellion was complete, Colonel Dechert returned to his pro fession of the law in his native city. He is at present an Assistant Disttict Attorney under Air. bheppard, and by the courteous and laim lul discharge of his duties, he has wou the re spect and confidence of the bar, and of the community generally. He is not a politician by trade, and ia free from "Rings" and all complications which would embarrass him as a Senator. Such is the nomination made by the Demo crats in the elope Senatorial district, whoe de cision on the 20th instant is to dechie the po litical power of the Senate, nud it is an admo nition to the Republicans that they must "do likewise" if they would win. A Democratic candidate with a brilliant record as a soldier, and unobjectionable either as to qualification or charncter, will demand the best candidate in the Republican purty to defeat him. A Strong domination. The Democratic delegates to tho First Phil adelphia Senatorial district met in convention on Thursday, tbe 1st instant, and on the first ballot nominated Col. Robert ?. Dech ert to fill the vacancy caused by the death of W. W. Wratt. Mr. Dechert served four yeara in the army during tbe late civil war, was a gallant soldier and left an honorable record behind him. He is a lawyer by pro fession, and at present occupies tbe respon sible position of Assistant District Attorney for the city of Philadelphia an office which he fills with admitted ability and integrity. At the fast October election he was the Dem ocratic candidate for Judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and in the wards comprising the Senatorial district in which be is now a candidate, he received a majority of the votes then polled. The Philadelphia Evening Tel egraph, a Radical paper, thus refers to the high staodisg and character of Col. Dechert aa a citizen and hie conceded strength as a candidate : The Democrats of the First Senatorial dis trict have ehowa their appreciation of the im portance of tae political struggle oi: the 20tb iotaut,b nonuaating, with great unanimity, Murder or a Nus in Pari. A beleag- ured correspondent writes from Paris : I regret to chronicle a very sad affair per haps the only serious offence that has dis graced the much tried Paris since its invest ment. From the opening of the 'siege the Sisters of Charity of the Hospital Cochin have distributed every day, to all poor per sons who called on them, milk fur infants and the sick. A woman who lives in the neighborhood did not coma for her usual supply the other day until a very late hour. She was informed by the Sisters that by this time very little milk was left, but that they would give her all they could spare. Her vessel was taken from her, and after wards returned three quarters full. Tbe woman became angry and insolent and up brafded the nuns for not keeping for her a proper allowance, as she came regularly every day. She west off. threatening with lively menaces the Sister whose duty it was to distribute the milk among the poor. Next day she came back at the ordinary time, and seemed angrier even than before, shouting, "I must pay off that r.uu !" On the third day she contrived to insinuate her self perhaps not too gently into tbe pas sage that leads into the kitchen of the Sis ters, and then, snatching a flesh knife from a table, she waylaid her charitable foe. When tbe Sister had finished her distribu tion of food and returned to the kitchen, the woman plunged the kuife into her breast, the effect being to injure fatally one of her lungs. For three or four days the poor nuu lingered ; on the fifth she died. 4 o'clock, to enjoy a comfortable smoke." There is a lighteous law in Ohio, under which a family of children in Zinesville have been awarded $300 damages, against a saloon-keeper who sold liquor to their father. John Q. Hodges, a negro member of the Virginia Legislature, from the Norfolk dis ttict, ha6 been arrested for burglary. Of such is the Republican party in the South composed. A letter-writer, describing a recent ball, says the feature which made the deepest impression on him "was the unusual number of very plump women foaming over the tops of their dresses." The almshouse barn of York county, filled with grain anil seventeen bead of cat tle, was destroyed by fire early on Sunday moruing. Tbe building was one of the lar gest in the State. A writer in the Binghampton Repub lican says that some burned shingles were rceently" taken from a roof at Clifton Springs, and carried by the wind to a dis tance nf four mi!e9. There is a well in the Oil Region owned by ladles, which produces one hundred and fifty barrels per day. It is commonly known as the "Ladies Well" and is eight hundred and Mxtj'-five feet deep. The war in Europe looks like it were simply a bargain between King William and Napoleon to. swop populations, by get ting all the Germans into France and all the Frenchmen into Germauy. Washington county contains 25 persons between the age of 90 add 95 years, and four who are over 100 years old. One of the latter, Robert Collins, is 102. and can still read without spectacles. A porter of one of the Chicago hotels, an industrious and very saving man, has amassed a snug little fortune of twenty thou sand dollars from his salary and perquisities during the last fifteen years. John II. Surratt is announced to lecture --At Monmouth, Illinois, on Thursday morning, while an omnibus containing three young ladle was etandicg at the railroad depot, the horses were frightened by the wanton blowing cf the locomotive whistle by one of the railroad employees. Tbe hor ses ran off, whereupon the yoong women jumped out, and one of them was fatally injured. The people threaten to lynch the man who blew the whiatle. Greencastle, Franklin comity, has re cently been ptrple2ed by the physical form ation of a colored man. He has a double organization and can change his heart Into four different positions, whilst his bowels revolve around like a ball with great rapid ity, backward and forward, and when their motion ceases an extra set of ribs slide dowc and cover the entire abdomen. He says he does not suffer in the least from Ibis curicOs freak of nature. Callicot, the fellow who sold out to the Radicals after being elected as a Democrat to tbe New York Legislature, and who tcok to stealiDg after being appointed a Reveoi e Collector, has been pardoned by Grant. We suppose the President thought it hard that one thieving Radical should be com pelled to endure all the discomforts of life within the walla of a prison, while such a multitude of similar rogues walk about in broad cloth, honored and influential mem bers of the Republican party. A child, twenty-one months old, was at play on the track uear the depot at Rut land, on Saturday, when a locomotive slow ly backed toward her, and the rear end of the tender slightly touched the child on the ear, and, without breaking the skin or other wise injuring her only in the sligLtst man ner, moving her along some feet, the child constantly rolling over, until she fell into a space between the ties which was somewhat - . t lower than tbe other places, ana in tins con dition the engine and tender passed entirely over her without any further it jury. It is customary in Massachusetts to open the sessions of the Supreme Court with prayer. At the recent term io Fitch burg the clergyman in attendance, after asking Divine favor and guidance for the presiding Judge, proceeded to earnestly im plore tbe Lord for similar blessings upon the judge's wife, and children, that they might be spared in life and health during his absence, and that, at the close cf the term, be might be once more restored to the bosom of his family.

She was not mistaken about his being a negro, though she would Dot be able to recognize him. Neighbors heard her screams. We do not believe these outrages are per petrated by any of tbe old negro residents of tbe borough ; they have heretofore shown a better disposition ; and to keep themselves clear of suspicion they ove it to themselves to aid in ferreting out the miscreants, that they may be justly dealt with.

We can now form a clearer view of the desperate fighting of last week. Briefly told, Ducrot, having crossed the river Marne and indicted heavy losses upon the Wurtembergers and Saxons in his front, was compelled by the arrival of heavy Gorman reinforcements, to retreat to the west bank of the river and take shelter nnder Forts Vincennes aod Charentou. His men fought with great courage and were ably handled, but the movement was a bloody failure. At the same time the effort of Paladines to effect a junction with the French armies at Paris, was baffled and Paladines has fallen back on his entrench ments. M. Gambetta has a right to praise the bravery of the French troops, but he was premature in his announcements of sig nal victories, and in all probability ere this week closes will take his departure from Tours and issue his proclamations from some other city. Tbe failure of these two great movements for raising the siege of Paris, stamps the '.French cause with the seal of final doom. There is no other conclusion. Pittsburgh Chronicle.

One of the occupants escaped by jumping out one of the upper windows, but he was so severely stunned that he was insensible for some time. Kecovering his consciousness he endeavored to render assis tance to the suffering inmates but it was too late, the devouring element forbidding at help. He then ran to some of the neigh bors, who came promptly, but all they could do was to look on the horrible sight as it presented itself in the four bodies envel oped in the flames.

The advantage of having plenty of money, even when one has no social position, is well shown by the fact that Laura Fair, the murderess of Chittenden, was daintily carried to jiil, attended by nurse and doctor, and is treated with all possible consideration. A San Francisco correspondent grows pa thetic about the matter, and talks of how, iu the cell next that occupied by the harlot and murderess, there lies on a pallet cf straw a womau who stole to keep her child ren from starvation, while her neighbor is as comfortable as possible. However, at each made her choice of the sort of crime it would he well to commit, each takes the legitimate consequences of her act, and if money will not help one in adversity, what iu the world is tho use of money ?
