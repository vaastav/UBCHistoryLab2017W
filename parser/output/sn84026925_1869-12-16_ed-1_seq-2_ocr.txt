X.?The paper will be discontinued on the expiration of tee time for which payment has been made. a Subscriber finding a (x) cross-mark on the wrapper or margin of his paper, will understand that the time paid for has expired. ENLARGEMENT QF THE ENQUIRER. On the first of January next, the size of the Enquirer will be increased by the addition of one column to each page and by lengthening its ool-' umns, so that the enlargement will be equivalent to seven of its present ootorans. It will then be, 1 #ithbirt exoeption, the largest paper printed in the 'State. ,nJ :.;n.? ?. 1 The increasing pressure -upon our advertising columns renders this enlargement necessary, in order that our subscribers may have the usual va- ' riety of reading matter. But, notwithstanding ! the increase of size, there will be no increase of prifce. We propose to furnish our headers with as good a paper as can be furnished for the price anvwhere. In the management of the paper, the 1 same principles will be observed as have always governed it. Hie prominent objeot will betO maintain a high tone, courteous to all, partizan for none, bat reserving the right of a free expression of opinion at all times and'ob all subjects. In this oonnectibn we would call upon the friends of the Enquirer to still further increase its circulation, and tender our thanks to them for what they have aheady done. Wljile we have not relied entirely upon the aid of friends, and believe in helping ourselves before we ask help from Jupiter, still we put ai high value upon such aid. By way of return, we promise that the more the circulation of the Enquirer increases, the better paper we will make it. ? the census returns. " The St^te Commissioner of Agriculture has t made a partial report of the census taken this year. The portion of the report published furnishes only the statistics, of population in seventeen counties. There are fourteen counties yet to be heard from, so that it is not absolutely correct to make any deductions from the results so far obtained. Still, the results are extraordinary, it appearing that the increase of population in seventeen counties, more thaq half the State, has only been sixty-twoio nine years. The late census showed a population of 300,278; that of 1869, 300,340. Had. the popu iation of these counties increased in the ratio of the ten years previous to 1860, the increase should have been 45,820. With reference to color, the late census makes the relative voting population of these oounties, White, .30,148; Colored, 29,021. It is. proper to state that the return includes all the oounties in which ihe whites predominate. All the counties yet .to' be heard from will exhibit majorities of ' oolored voters. The relative increase or decrease t of white and black population is not given. It is impossible, therefore, to locate the loss of increase shown?over 15,000. These figures include the losses war, disease and emigration. It may be also that they include errors in figures; for the persons employed in taking the oensus were not jelected on account of their knowledge of arithmetic. Not to put too fine a point on it, the census-takers throughout the State were generally inoompetent, and little confidence can be felt in the correctness 'of their returns.

In the Senate, Mr. Sumner introduced a bill looking to the resumption of specie payments; Mr. Drake, a bill to prohibit the Supreme Court from exercising jurisdiction over the acts of Congress ; and Mr. Williams, a bill to regulate the importatipu of Chinese. On the 7th, the Senate passed a joint resolution to remove all political disabilities, upon the ratification of the 15th amendineut. Mr. Williams introduced a joint resolution that qo State, having once ratified an amendment to the constitution, shall have power to rescind that ratification. This resolution is aimed at New York and, Ohio, wbioh States desire to withdraw their ratification of the N?th amendment. 1 House, the following bills were introducT^rre<1: 10 re"orKanize the Treasury De P^^^Horcpeiil the tenure-of-office act; to es- ; tabnsh a ^jyVisyBteir, of naturalization, to prohibit sales of tjje United States, and to provide for ?|s^mpUo0 of legal-tender ' notes m coin at par.

This is regard- , id as equivalent to its ultimate defeat, as the mem- , bers are understood to be hostile to the bill, and 5ve of them voted to lay it on the table, just hefore it was referred. The census bill was discussed luring most of this and the two previous days. On the 13th, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a bill in referenoe to Georgia, modeled apon the suggestions of the President's message. < In the House, the admission of Virginia was the ] prominent topic of discussion.

LEGISLATORS IN TROUULE*. . . } Senatore Rainey, Wimbush and Wright, of the ( i. C.

Senators Sawyer and -Robertson, who were going )n to attend the meeting of Congress. As they iad procured first class tickets, the whole party ode in the cars with "white folks," until they jtruck the Richmond and Danville railroad, in Virginia. At Danville the colored gentry were jrdered ont of the car they were in and ordered Uto the negro car. They refused to go out, no loubt thinking themselves above riding With nejroes, and were not disturbed at the time. But )n reaching Clover Station, two of them stepped )ut for "refreshments," and once ont they were lot allowed to return. Wright, the remaining colored gent, was then ordered out again,'and, on refusing to comply, was put out by force, by order of President Buford,.of the road, who was on the train. [(> J( t.'. ' . Burning with a sense of his wrongs, Wright, when he got into the bosom of his beloved "Labor Convention," reported in favor of recommending that a bureau he created, to which this matter, rith others relating to the exclusion of colored people from the cars, be referred, and that a fund be created to prosecute any such case of exclusion, under the Civil Rights bill, and to test the virtue )f that hill. He has further appeased his wrath by bringing a suit against the Richmond and Panrille Railroad. The South Carolina Legislature has also taken ip the oanse of their aggrieved brother. Notioe lias been given in; both Houses, of a bill to repeal iha charter of the Air-Line Railroad, of which Mr. Buford, the daring ejector of Wright, is President. The question naturally arises: Wherein oonsists the insult of putting these colored men into a car ippropriated for the use'Of their race? Are they ibove riding with their own brethren, or do they consider that they are in better company when seated femong "white folks?" If so, they certainly'must think that white folks are better than negroes, whieh is rank heresy in such elected champions of negro equality. ; ;j . - . .Ij

LETTER FROM COLUMBIA. THE ORATION BEFORE THE .LITERARY SOCIETIES? ' ' TJNIVERSITY OP SOtJTn CAROLINA. Mr. Edttorr?Ttewg one of the audience at the jelebfation of the, "Annual Oration," recently deivered, before, the Clariosophic and Edphradian 3ocieties; at the S. C. University, I am indticied to nib'my quill, to write a communication for the oubltc eye, concerning this interesting event in the liistoiy of the Institution. I feel the more indined to do so, .from the fact that your fellow-towiisman, Col. Wilson, was the orator on the occasion; ind I am confident that the readers of your valuable paper, who did not have the pleasure of hearng his address, will be interested to know something of its merits. : ... And here I .may remark, that the custom of paying honor to excellence seems to have prevailed imong every people which has existed on the earth. Man pausep in his course?turns aside for a season ?whilst he gives the tribute of praise to his felow. To this end he is gifted with faculties, and the display of high endowments irresistibly force themselves upon his notice and compel his admiration. It.'. : Impelled by such n spirit, on tlie 7th instant, ifter the busy day was past? "And th? twilight ahtdows?fU-allng O'er tite world?their mantle cut," i large and intelligent crowd psseipbledin the University Chapel. i Here were to be seen a retinue of litizens of Columbia and several of the orator's old slasi-matos from a distance. Woman, too, with per presence, graced the ooeasion, and by the powir of her beauty attracted many gallants. Daailidg lights illuminated the hall and music lent her jharms. All these circumstances combined to supply spirit to, and animate the occasion. Soon the Presidents of the Societies, followed by the members, escorted the speaker to the stand. Just is they entered the threshold of the spacious building, an overture was struck up by the band of malic. Scarcely had the speaker taken his seat, when jvery eye was riveted upon him, as if to read ?lio Rirrl, nrnpnlnfinnq nrAvirtiiolv pnlpp. 17 UUbUUi UUU Ulgil wa|/uviwwiw?u) |/?w? ? <%? tained, were to be realized. The approving smile, following such glanoes, clearly showed that satisfaction was given so for. Col. Wilson is one of Nature's noblemen, and hris personal appearance indicates that he can maintain hiriself in the field of oratory, for he has not left uncultivated the graces of eloquence. Such Battering testimonials as these, visible to the most careless observer, at once recommended him to the audience, and the creditable manner in which he acquitted himself tfas'not to be gainsaid. The honor conferred upon hiin was returned ten-fold to hif."Alma Mater," and we cannot wonder at the enthusiasm his 'Address created, especially ajnong {he students, who greeted him with round after round of cheers. _ *- " The address deserves more than a brief notice, such as is usually given in the columns of a newspaper. The subject was admirably well chosen? "TVifi South?Recojlectioiis of herpast; duties of her new career. Xbe warmth of expression aooompanying it sunk into the hearts of all who were present, and touted the responsive chords which aver vibrate ip a true patriot's soul. It was distinguished alike; for its close argument and stirring eloquence. It contained many passages of striking force and finished beauty, and I am. sorry that I am unable to. give some extracts; but it is to be hoped: that the address will.be published in pamphlet format an early day* This is equally due to the subject and the author. i And now, Mr. Editor, before I conclude, if yon will allow further spaoe, I must say a word in behalf of the Uni vertity. This institution still exists (though it seems the people do not know it), the most imperishable monument of the State's wis Jom and liberality.- "'As Col. Wilsoti said in his ipeebh, it alone has survived amid the gehferal wreck of ruih. It has been, all along, and still is idding'its anrihal tribute of learning to the general intelligence df the State, and contributing its successive generations of enlightened yduth to commence their career of usefulness and'honor, and to occupy distinguished places in society. It is not patronized as it Should be. This neglect is a source of astonishment and mortification to the young men at this time within her walls. The embarrassments to which she has been subjected are disappearing, and it behooves the citizens of South Carolina to sustain their sons at a seat of learning where their acquirements will amply compensate for the patronage bestowed. To the young men let mc say, as one of the number, that education is requisite for the future welfare of the State, and it is our bounden duty, in thB meantime, to mark with a vigilant eye and sfiize with a strong hand, all the pmifjilitiej? of our actual situation. Education, it is said, is a good investment. and surelv these trvinz times should rather enhance its value than cause it to languish. Heed then the appeal which our bleeding country makes and come to the rescue. The various schoolsLaw, Medical, and Academic?are all in successful operation, and the beginning of the second terra, February 15th, 1870, will be a good time to enter. 

"ALLIQUIS ORITUR." What is a Sweet Potatoe t A Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Gazette, says: "A curious case was decided by the Internal Revenue Bureau to-day. Some time ago a question was submitted by the Virginia Internal Revenue officials whether sweet potatoes should be considered as grain 6r fruit It appears that in Virginia, as in other parts of the Union, doubtless, whiskey is made from sweet potatoes. Under a provision of the law stills distilling from fruit are exempt, or subject to alowor tax tnan manufactories making whiskey from grain. Distillation from sweet potatoes iB extensively carried on in Virginia, ana hence_ the question. The Commissioner carefully considered the subject, and decided today that within the meaning of the Act of Congress sweet potatoes must be regarded as a grain."

No man making the least pretension to intelligence and progress cap think of doing without bis. newspaper., At this stage ofthe nineteenth century it is a necessity. We like papers, &qd respect those whq read them. We even have-some sort of respect tor the man Who steals a newspaper to read. He is not utterly bad. He steals to make himself wiser?and there is hope in him. But he who abuses papers, and reads them not, is worse than an infidel, and deserves respect from neither Jew nor Gentile. The year is drawing to a dose, and it is time for each one to make up his-mind as ? - ?1 to the paper or papers ne wiu 1RJA.L yUM. I Look around you, and select. The variety which i the Press offers is sufficient to please persons of every age and condition, of every political and religions creed, or of no creed at all. We have never seen a paper worth less than the subscription, (and we have seen some veiy poor ones,) and they are generally worth much more. Then let the head of each family look to his own wants, and his wife's wants and tastes, and his children's wants and fancies, and take papers to suit all. A judicious investment in that way is better than a Life Insurance, or Savings Bank, or 7-40's. It is a thousand fold better than investing in gift enterprises, faro banks and dram shops. At this season of the year the hog subject is always interesting. Now that we are on it again, we suspect that we may be accused of "going the whole hog." At the present high prices of pork the , country will have to raise its own meat; and to do that on the cheapest scale, we must learn how to i prevent and cure hog diseases. Dr. McCluney, | near Smith's Ford, gave some young hogs arsenic 1 twice a week, about two grains to each hog, and none of them became sick. His neighlwrs lost many. He says if he were to administer it to,a ( sick one, he would give three to five grains. We j had one that became sick in the pen. We turned it out and gave stryohnine?about the half of a small thimble-full. In twelve hours it was well 1 and hearty. From that one case we can not determine whether the medicine effected a cure or not. We have tried several remedies for lice on hogs, i Dot the best found is a mixture of tar and tallow. k neighbor of mine suggest train-oil as better ;ban tallow,. It should be jnilk warmwhen app|pd, the nog being caught gpdheld. .Two appliations on every hog a farmer may have will drive may the insect, and Ieaye the hog in a more comfortable and thriving condition., P. State Auditor's Report.?The following is a synopsis from the report of Mr. Reuben Tomlinwn: , _ The total amount remveS on account oftaxes for fiscal year 18<$, to October 31, 1869, inclusive; is $1,028,696,88. Of this amount, aooording, to the returns received up to the writing ofthisseport, $58,123 was paid on.account Qf roll tax, apd $982,607.98 for purposes of Sufte Government. The poll taxes of Orangeburg, Richland and Charleston, not yet frilly collected. After reviewing the former tax laws of the State, the Auditor says: The real property of the State is estimated at.$76,125,021, and the personal at $28,828,446. Making a total of $114,$$,467. "But," says the Auditor, "it is generally admitted,']. believe, even by those most opposed to the present Government, that the real estate and personal property of the 8tate wonld be below their true value at $200,000,000.

The duty imposed upon the Board by tbe law is as flesr.ahd explicit as any other duty under it. Thafdiity was to raise the wat property 6f tbe several bounties to what they believed to be its true value. This they did1. It? has been asserted that this increase was made in order to raise the amount of revenue needed by tbe State. Such is not the case- The revenue could have been raised as readily by increasing the per centum of taxation; and the clainor which would have ensued in that eveht would bave.been no greater. The State Board waa aware that this increase would bear heavily upon some individuals, and hence felt the responsibility resting : upon them; but they were also aware that if no increase was. made in the valuation, an increase would have to be mad? in the rate, and this would not onfr be oppressive upon individuals, bat upon counties, as oompared with other bounties. It has been asserted' that tbtt Board ib a monstrous Hhomaly, and that it ought not to he permitted to exist. Similar Boards exist in all the States, where this system of taxation prevails, and* in their optiatton an found to beach mirable incentives toward securing fair and equal assessment in tbe various Jocal communities. The people in the different oountie^ of this Statawifl see to it in any future assessment of their "property, that very little work" shall be left, for thi State Board ofBquaKaaUdu.,J^ ' ' /' ?f??* (i. .! ?):/ /!-n?.
