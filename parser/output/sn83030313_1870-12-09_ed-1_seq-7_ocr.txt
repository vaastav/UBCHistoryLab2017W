Among the many prominent politicians of Mexico Sefior Romero stands in the foremost rank. His opposition, th refor\ to the continuance of the Zona Libre, whu'h In M -xican Congress has, by a vote of ei^hty-flvo to thirty-seven, decided not only to continue but to extend, is nn evidence not only of his patriotism but Also of his foresight. Tin reason given by Rome of the M xican la ,i?lator3 for ihe con tinuance and ex'ension of the zone, which thoughtful Mexioani regard as an injnry rather than an advantage to the States within tho jurisdiction of which the fres z me extends, !b an expression of dfl mco to the United States. Why, this is aim ,1/ the madness of egotism and tin blindness of conceit ? not reason! Tlnro is no r*ason whatever in it. The United St.it ?? entertain none but the moat friendly fe -lin^s for M x co, and why the Mexicans dedr < to offer the peoplj of this country defiance it is hard to tell, la the con* tinuation of fie free jme this country is interested if by its continuance citizens living on the border are in jural by it. That sm ig glin^ is carried oi to tho detriment of honor able dealers living on ihe American side of tin Rio Grande is conceded on both sides. Those citizens will have to be protected in their rights. The Unlt.-d S ates government does not desiro to interfere with toe internal man agement of M xican affilrs, and th it <-V' ry sensibl ? Mexican well kn >ws ; but it must a id will protect i s own citizens, and if the pur suance of stie'i course gives offence to those who advocate thefr-e zene, as a defl ince to the Yankee goveram3.it, ba it so. Seiior liomcro'a apeecii is a timely and wise r mon strance, and us fie bill has not yet been signed by President Juarez, who is alio an opponent of this protective smuggling scheme, we hope # that wiser counsels will pr-.'V.i 1 and that Mexican logisli ors will adrpt some more statesmanlike arjum *nt to gn de them in thnr legislation th m seeking by deli nice the ill will ot a nation which nr iantl/ and sincerely wishes peace and prosperity to M xico. Emigrant Swiudl as - V New Uod<te. Swindling emigrants appears to havo become it scie nce. Theolddiys of baggage smash ing have departed. Thanks to the excellent system adopted at Caa.le Gtrden there is little chance left for the swindler) lo clnat t io emi grants while under the protection of tho Emi grant Commission. Therefore the swindlers have changed their ground. The last trick, it Appears, is to post them leives upon tho rail road cars and, under the giise of officials of the railroad company and Stvte detectives, to levy blackmail upea tlie poor emigrants. Those fellows demand to sae tin tick its of the passengers and, pronouncing tliem irregular, demand an extra price of t.vo or three dol lars trom the emigra it, upon the threat of destroying the tick ets if their demands are not complied with. Need wo say that tin poor atranger, travelling in tv strange land, ia will ing to aacrilico anything rather than iosa the tickets which are too passport to hia destina tion in the far West ? An example ia i'kely to be mado of these heartless scoundrel*, for the detectives, having got track of their pract'c >s, 1 >id a trap for two of thein on the Hiil-nn lliver road, and caught them in the very act of robbing the passengers by the ubove process. They were taken off the cars and are now in custody. We hope that these fellows will be severely punished. The Castle Garden authorities should look after this matter, for, although they had done their duty to the emigrants after they wore provided with genuine tickets ? all paid up ? and started for their destination, it seems that this fraud was committed within the precincts of the city before the train reached Thirty-sixth street. We owe every protection to the o nigrants who trust the n selves to our laws and our humanity for kind treatment on their arrival here. The Luxembourg Question Again.? By a j special cable despatch to the Herald we have intelligence to the effect that Prussia contem plates the ann.'X it ion of Luxembourg. It is said that the section of France which Prussia intends shall henceforward belong to Germany wi:l be insecure or useless without Luxem bourg. It is believed that Great Britaia will not go to war on that issue. We are not dis posed to regard this piece of news as other than a mere rumor. Prussia has entugh on her hands. She is too anxious to have this war off her hands to be willing to burden her self with nny new d flioulty. Did wo think there was any truth in the report wo should eay, Why halt at Luxembourg? Why not gobble up Belg-urn, Holland, Denmark? Why uot Gerraaaize Swi.zerland and wipe out the Danish monarchy as was wiped out in 16C6 the kingdom of Hanover? Prussia must now have a seaboard ; but, ardently as seaboard U desired, let us not be led into the belief that Count Bismarck is a fool. If the Luxem bourgers desiro annexation to Germany, well and good. If they dou't, Prussia will not now attempt coercion. The Miners' Strike in Pennsylvania.? Will not some advislug angel consult with the coal miners on their present strike in Penn sylvania ? They have taken a bad time to do a bad thing. The price of coal in this market ? *ay summer prices, or six and a half doliars a 1on ? for family use is as low as it can bo expected to be purchased in the Eastern markets, and those in irkets aro well supplied. Therefore, may it not be asked whether the miners are wise in their present strike? We want all workin men and laborers to have a fair show in the regular business movements of the day, aud wdl stand by them in thoir efforts to attain legitimate aims. In that spirit we adtise the Pennslyvania coal miners to go to work and keep at it until a more pro propitious season arrives for them to mako a demonstration* IatorMtlac from Enj-pt. Some days ago we learned that the Khedive | or E,;ypt had resolved to put his fleet, wh'ch Is highly respectable, at least in appoaraice, at th<> service of the Sul an in the e cut of war breaki g out bvtween the Sublime Po to and tUo covornmen^ of Russia. Now we lo; rn that the Khedive has reso'ved to place at tho disposal of tho Sultan o:ic hundred tlio?i and mou, aimed with breich-loaders. Tl.i-i looks very well ou paper; but tho fact is that 1 ? -ut ^ in no tit condition to no to war in any I shupe or U.iTJ or ?n any trtdh, The c ondition ! o. t ie Egyptian peep"!? U jdtiabT?. Vic1' I roy hus well nltjh dos.royed ibc? spirit of bis j people. Tho fellahs, or children of "til* *til, | are the most miserabb people on the face of j the eart'i.

But, unless we greatly mis takj, ho w.il be the last Mjhamiuedm ruler of the land o t ie Pharaohs. His hundred thousand men armed with breech-loaders do not amount to much. Egypt is the highway by which tho civilization of the West seeks the East ; but the government of Ism?il Pacha, with his sham Parliament, is au obstruction. Tiik Greatest St. Domingo Difficulty in the Senate is sail to ba Mr. Sumner's Gomiu.tloo on Foreign Relations. The ma jority of thj couimi tee is with Mr. Sunnier against the S . Domi igo scheme. To get over this obstruction it is reported that tho sup p iters of General Grant in tho Senate in this scheme have made a move to tako off Mr. Patterson, of N.w Hampshire (a Sumner man), iron! the committee, a ;d to put Mr. Oonkliug, of N w York (a Grant man), in his place; anil a consi lerable fuss is said to have fol lowed l he proposition in caucus. But there in no necessity for any change in the composi tion of Mr. Sumner's committee on this subject in order to carry th.; measure. Let the com mittee be instructed to report yea or nay, and th . Senate can pins the bill looki ig to annexa tion all tho name. The Sauate has ouly to apply tho ser w and the thing Can be done. Judge Dowlino, when he remanded the mou ter Evans to the Tombs under fifty thousand dollars bail the other day, remarked tUut ho would like to see a policeman sta tioned in front ot all such shops as that bojus pV.yilclan conducted to infjr.n pjople about entering of the character of th s places. No doubt the unfortunate people who seek relief at the hands of the demons who conduct these pi tees do so wilfully, with the full intention of securing their illicit object; but it is equally true that few of them comprehend the mur derous risk they run, or know that thes-^prac titionerj arj mere uneducated quacks, more apt to kill than cure. If policeman were sta tioned t'ler ? to warn them that they would cer ainly be fleeced, and probably stand a fair cha ico of being murdered, doubtless the patronage these vampires now erjoy would be sensibly reduced. An Impudent Pboposition. ? At the meet ing of the Bjard of Public Parks on Wednes day a person more gifted with greed than modesty made a formal proposition for per mission to run an elevated railroad through the Grand Park. Just think of a railroad lor purposes of public trafflo running through a pleasure ground devoted to the reposa ot the citizens and the cultivation of all that is beautiful In art i One spot at least should bo leit undeflled, and that is the Central Park ? the public paradise of the metropolis. Very properly the Park Commissioners, on motion of Mr. Robert J. D.ilon, rejected this ill-timed proposition. Personal Intelligence. Major C. H.

WASHINGTON. A Bi'oezo in tin Sanatoria! Caucus. ~ THE ST. DOMINGO Til EAT Y LOOMING CP. Opening the Way to the Resurap tioa of Spjoio Payments. BOfflHATIOHJ SEJX TJ ri gMlJE. PiiiiMmiiit of the Colored Cadet. Washington, Dec. 8, 1870. Republican Ncnutoil.l Cauc in? A B rtt j-e I Ov?r tbn Mini I) am' ii : ? treaty. According to all reports there was quite an excite i I n tr scene la itio republican Senatoilal caucus ihu morning. It appears thut Senator Chandler, who I was chairman of t'io special com.ulttee uppoiuted ' at a previous caucus to revise tho standing couiuiit | tees oi ttie So. late, made an arrangement by willed | It was intended that Senator 1'aterson, of New j Hampshire, was lobe removed from tho Coiumlitee on Foreign Relations aud Senator Coukllng, of New | York, a, pointed In Ills place. 'I lie object of this I chauge was obvious to every member of tlie caucus, j La?t winter, wneu the St. liouitngo treaty was be foio Uio Committee o.i Foreigu Relations, Senator | Paiorsou was oue of those wliu opposed it. lie had, bo to speak, tlio casting vote, it Is stated by the i opponents oi the treuty that me object of senator I t hanolcr In reporting the proposed change was to j secure a majority ol oue in this commutes In lavor of the treaty. Chandler disclaimed any such intention, aud sa>s that he made tho change because senator Patterson was to bo appo.nted onairm an of ill.; Cnminlttee on tho Dis til t oi Co.uiuUia, and that ho did not think 1'atter. sou would want a place on t'.ic Foreign Itelal.ous Committee. The disc issiou In the caucus, however, tile. led i lie fa*, th.it Patterson had not been con sulted in tli * matter. Mr. Sumner, who is cnair umii ol i ne committee, seems to navo been cognizant oi what was going uu. In fact, it would appear that some of the opponents ol tho fcau Do.nlngo treaty posted Sumner on the subject last evening. As a matter of course lie was prepared for what irauspireit in tho cau us tins morning. When Sena, tor Cuandlei* submitted his report Senator Suniiicr Immediately ar.jio aud characterized tho intended change iu the com nlttoo as something extraordi nary. He thought that, as a matter of courtesy to him as chairman of the committee, he should have been consulted belore Kay change were proposed. The commune as at present constituted was very acceptable to him, and while he had no ob jection to Ur. ConkUng ho thought it his duty to oppose tho removal of Mr. Patters n, especially when he understood that the latter gentleman (leaned to remain a rnc mber cf the committee. Mr. chandler denied any Intention of tnterterius with Mr. Sutnnei or tho members of 1:1 i comuiutoe. He had placed Mr. Cunkling on that commi'teo because Mr. J'at.erson had been ass.gucd the chairmanship or ou<s oi the most important com mitters of iho senate. Mr. Wilson, who may be termed the peftcetnak r of the republican party, seeing that trouble -*! i ahead, aro.'^.ind counselled harmony. In has capacity of medial >r he managed to take the aid; of his colleague, Mr. Sumner. Ho dl<l uot think it wl.-o to remove Mr. Patterson from no Committee <m Foreign Relations, and in conclusion he moved that the report of ttie special com in. tie o be recommitted, witn instructions to bring In another report. In which the Foreign Rela tions Committee would be allowed to remain a? at present conititut d. After some dis :ttssion this was agreed to, and Zach Chandler went out of the caucus a sadder if cot a wiser man. If he had any purpose to servo lu the rearrangement of tho Foreign Relations Committee he was defeated, and Mr. Sumner was victorious. It seems to be the general impression that { the result ot this caucus to-day is a severe blow to the prospects of the ratification ot tho St. Domingo treaty at this session, The Foreign Relations Com mittee, as at present consumed, is decidedly against it, and tho triumph of Mr. Sumner to-day indicates that he has still a majority or the republican Sena tors with him In his opposition to the treaty. This republican majority, with the democratic Senator# who are opposed to the acquisition of St. Domingo, Is considered sufficiently strong to defeat the una sore whenever It may be Introduced, Decline of American Commerce. The select Committee on the Decline or American Commerce, of which Representative Lynch Is chair man, will hold their first meeting this session to morrow. The entire subject, as heretofore referred, is still before them, and a report will be maae at au early day. As nsual, so much or the President's Message as relates to that matter was referred to the Committee on Commerce, this being a standing committee, not, however, involving any conflict with the subjects before the special committee. Opening the VVny to Specie Payment*. A proposition has been made In tho Committee on Banking and Currency to bring In a bill providing that one-tenth of the receipts for Import duties shall be paid In gre nbacks Instead of In gold. The ob ject or this is to appreciate the value of the legal tenders and to open the road for a return to specie payments. The proposition is understood to have originated with the Secretary of the Treasury, and Is also endorsed by tho Comptroller of the Cur rency and other prominent treasury officials. It does not meet the approbation of a majority of the committee on banking and currency, and it la not believed that It can command suillcleat support to secure its passage in tlio House. Redemption o! Throe Per Cent Certificate*. The Secretary of the Treasury to-day gave orders to tho Assistant Treasurer at New York to notify the holders of three per cent temporary loan cerllll cates, issued under tho acts of 2d March, 1807, and ( 25th July, 1808, that all such certificates bearing date 15th October, lsC7, of the denomination of $300 each, between the numbers 249 and 850, Inclusive, and of the denomination of $1,00J each be tween tuo numbers 19) aful 356, In clusive, will bo paid on presentation at his office; and that from and arter aist of January, 1871, such certificates will ccase to bear interest, and will be no longer available as a portion of the lawfnl money reserve In the possession of any na tional banking association. The aggregate amcunt of the certificates described la 12,000,000, making the total amount advertised thus far $4, 000,000. Minister Wnsbburne's Correspondence. In reply to a resolution of the, Senate calling for all the correspondence between thy Untied States Minister at Paris and tTio Secretary or State irom the breaking ont of the war between France and Prus sia, the President to-day Informed the Senate that all the desired correspondence waa communicated with other diplomatic correspondence accompany ing the President's Message cn the 5th Inst. Operations of the Whiskey Rlof. The Internal Revenue Bureau Is anticipating an earnest report on the part of distillers to nave the law requiring them to use meters abolished. It is a well known fact that doriug the recent election campaign in the West certain republican candidates for Congress appealed to the Commissioner of luler ternal Revenue not to enfoice the regulation re quiring meters to bo attached to distilleries within ninety days. The Commissioner, think ing, perhaps, more time was needed, ex tended It, but this was not satisfactory. The metre itself was the objection, and some went so far ax to say that the whiskey ring would defeat their election unless the obnoxious order was rescinded altogether. Now the subjcct Is likeiy to l>e revived in Congress bv the introduction of a bill abolishing tho use of metres, and this under tho pledge made to those who are so fortunate as to bo members of the present Congress and members elect of tne next, ynless the Una. succeed in having a commissioner appointed rf their own choirs, the Internal Ravomie 1 ureau will oppos ? any legislation lookup to tho a'-o ltlou or I lie metro sj-iem, wlih argument, taoU and tU careful results or the must extended expert in' nt-> made with t lie Instruments touted.

SEMEH'XS. Fifth Avem'k Tiik\trb-"Thr Hunchback." ? Hluridan K no tv tea' line old play. "TUe Hunchback," was given for the second and hist time at this the atre laM evening. The cast was as follows: Master W aller, Mr. lliuklns; Sir Thomas Cdfford, Mr. Do Vere; Modus, Mr. i'oik; I uhoin. Mr. Davldge; Mas ter Wllford, Mr. Arthur Mathlsou; Julia, Miss Ethel, aud Helen, Miss l'aunj laveuport. Tito title rote aud that of Julia did not seem to us to be m either Mr. Hai kins' or Miss Ethels particular line. The one Is too earnest an l tnatttr-of-fact, with all his 1 splendid abilities as an actor, to niv<. due ex pre sion to the limon-UKe vein of bitterness tuai unlerdes Master \\ niter's character. There is peasive a i ran ai Miss K t riel' h eliara ter ai an actress whleh o.\, ress s Itself in ever, part sue undertakes, and licuoe she failed to give t Uo transformed vnl age belle the desired effect when she appeared as a powder .-d ? -usation in Hie city. Mr. l)wly sliould oe cilery attont lues.1 old comedies, llts company is prouably tne best m America tor the luoilcrn i uoo.: witness tho success of tiie dramas o. "Feruande," ' Man a id Wile" aud "Prou-Frou;" bui in the days ot periwigs, powder, knee breeches, silk stockings aud pre jiosterous headdresses, when people s,okc and acted in u manner which nowauajs would set them down as lunatics, when nroaduess was n sign of wit and when men anil women moved in town circles like the figures on Strasbourg cincic, obedient ro the penriu uni oi ca tc aud us cog wheel*, Mr. Daly's company are not at home, 'l'liey represent the true American type oi actor and are aitve to every thought aud Idea of the present nay. But yotitif* people, as they principally are, tluy cannot realize on tho stage Hi? maimers aud cus toms of their great -grandfathers. Every thing on the stage ha> its own coterie of admirers, some like tragedy, and some are able to satisiy the most exact ing on this point, some like old comedy, dc-mi'ti.e phoiogmpns of the society of tne iast century. To satisiy them there are a few, very lew, people on the stage W no can 1 or the moment .forget the nine teenth century and brlnx vivtdiv before tne audience the belles and beaux, the Absolutes, Tea/.los, .Sneer wells and other not>?ules of society a hundred years ago. The pre^cut age is a hard, practical age in every respect aud likes to deal wun passing events. Steam, electricity and the printing press have revolutionized the stage as well as every thing else. People go to a theatre ior Instruction us well as amusement, ami even if they uo for tho latter alone, they prefer, as a geneial thin , in ccmeuy satires on the lollies of tue present d;iy, to the absurdities of wntcn their great-iireat-grand motliers were guilty, uence, if Mr. Daly will uniieie to the unslcrn school he will Una it maro palatable to the very fashionable class of people who freifiicut his pretty little theatre. The genius of the men who lashed the vices and lollies ot the last century and the times of our lathers is indubitable, and the nmu who can reach their standard at the present day i?y wielding a scourge as efficient will be one of the lions or our time. To-night the capital comedy, "London Assurance," will be given, and next week will be devoted to that immortal work, which is applicable to all places, all circumstances and all times, "Twelfth Night." Olympic Theatre ? A JirvKKrr-E Oai.a Day.? Wednesday afternoon completed an epoch la the eventrul career or "Wee WilHo Winkie," alius George L. Fox. He becumo the cynosure of oflklal eyes (Commissioners of Charities and Corrections) and the centre of admiration of several score juvenile eyes. Long before tho hour appointed for the opening of the doors of the OlyuiulO for tlio usual Wednesday afternoon performance nil Broadway whs moved, convulsed uiid otherw.so delighted by me spectacle of the children from Randall's Island, with their brass band, all cscoricd by the Ninth regiment, Jr., with colonel risk, "juuls simus," at their head, advancing ' > v forced marches on tho works oi the Olympic. The extensive mili tary experience of Messrs. l)ufT, Fox, Haves and b.vmons contributed much io the .success of the movement, uii'1 the Juveniles took the oivtopic t>v storm. A cloud oi skirmishers occupied the side walks and policemen acted as pioneers, ouco lnsldo the theatre, while the performance v\ eat. on. the faces of the young ones were n study In themselves. Tho Innumerable pranks of the prince of clowns, Fox, ami the songs, dances and comical Imitations of llitlo Jennie Yeainens found appreciative and enthu lastr ad mirers In the glistening laces or the uniformed juve niles. The hou?e was crowded to its fullest extent, and the tiny visitors seemed to occupy more atten tion from many sober-sided habituC* of tho theatre than the perlorraanoe itscir. The provoking comi cal tiles of Fox will bo long remembered by the many chubby facet that peeped over the balcony of the Olympic on Wednesday. It was a sight to be en* shrined In the memories of all present. Lieutenant Dan Bymomf was slightly Injured by the preai.ituro discharge or a gun while marshal llug his lorces be fore the performance. t Ban Fkancisco Min8trri,s "I.ft M* Rk." ? The Inimitable quartet? Birch, Wambold, Bernard and Backus? who nightly put on faces of mourning to amuse their thousand and one admirers, have got a programme of the rarest description this week at their cosey hall. "Let Me Be," Rollln Howard s latest production. Is the main attraction. Be tween It and "Shoo Fly" there is a sort of Damen and 1'ythlas friendship, and whero the mellifluous tones of tho one are heard there we may hear the respondent cudcuccs of the other. ''Laughing Gas," "The New Couiiiilssion ets" and "Moving In." are also on the bill, with a ?cry great many others too numerous to mention. For Intelligent interpreters of the cork drama and successful producers of broad grins commend us the Han Franc sco Minstrels. Mourning is generally sup posed to be tho semblance of woo, but their Inky physiognomies out-Mornus' Momus himself. Musical nnd llrnmntic Note*. Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams have returned to this city artor one of their most succes?lul sea sons In the surrounding towns. CUanfrau's "ham" has evoked all Us old time honored enthusiasm In Brooklyn. _ ^ _ 'lhe Western papers glow with tributes to the genius of seebftch. They pronounce her tho ilnest act reus ever known on their boards. Miss timtnu ceiia Te ry, a young American so prano of promising ability, gives a grand concert at gtemway Hall on the 'Join Inst. A number or Miss Annie Louise Can's Boston mends have presented her with a Diur ot oeauhful diamond eardrops. TPIb
