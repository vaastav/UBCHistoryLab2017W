FORAN'S ADDRESS. Tiie congress was called to order by J. "W. rnith. of .Springfield, ill. the chairman of tho ? Native committee, who in a brief speech w< .eonted the delegates and expressed the hr.pe ? ?l it their deliberations would hi attended a .tii it suits in keeping with the importance of '.i Interests which tiiey represented. He then introduced Hepresentative Martin A Forau, of r < tnnafl, who was present as a visitor, and ? i r. front n made a forcible speech, in which he dwelt tiiH>n the iui|><irtaii<'e to the laboring cla-si's of ? organization. The wealth of this *01111 try iiad a compact organization which was ? '.iK tiities called monopoly, and the labor of tiie country should also avail themselves of Ins agency for the protection of their interests. In the past organization had been effective and some good laws had been enacted. But none were needed. The members of this con ?y-<* were not socialists or communists, but t'ie> were law-abiding citizens. Among the 1.' *tv which were now to be gained was tiie a'.-oiiiion oi wage slavery in tiiis country,which ! ~p. aker regarded as great an evil as"human ? ?(.attel slavery in the past. T'le law in regard to the importation <>t cheap labor into this country ought to be enforci u and the govern ment should have paid agents at everv port of imiuigratiou, especially at Castle garden, to prevent this contract labor from being brought into the country. There should also be a law in regard to the use of convict labor in this country and he hoped that this Congress would srivo this matter their attention. In speaking of tiie progress made bv the laboring classes, he said that there was intelligence in the workshops aud well imoruied men there, and the people in making their selections for public offices should know this and avail themselves of the services ot such men. In conclusion lie hoped that the congress would formulate such measures that e< uid be brought to the attention of Congress. 1 he congress voted Mr. Foran a resolution of thanks, and alter api<oinihig a committee, con sisting ot the old officers, upon credentials, ad j>?limed until this afternoon at 3 o'clock. It is probable that the congres* will remain in session for four days, meeting at 9 o'clock each day and adjourning late in the afternoon.

The Fight a tiood Natural One. opeclul Di<*|Mttch to Thr Evevtxo Star. ? IticHMoxii, Dec. 8.?In tlie proceedings of last night s caucus of the democratic members of tue legislature/the noticeable incidents were the attempts of the Barbour men to filibuster witft a view to postponement of a nomination and the patient persistence of the Daniel men in forcing a close of the content. Iu the initial proceedings the leadership on both sides was skillful, the filibustering motions being directed by ex-Congressman Fnlkcrson, for a long time one of Mulione's leaders in the southwest. As foreshadowed in the dispatches of The Star of yesterday, there was no check In the current which has run steadily in favor of Daniel since the meeting of the legislature.

CAPITOL TO-DAY. READING THE MESSAGE SCEJTES IX BOTH HOUSES TO-DAT. At ten minutes past 12 to-day President Cleveland's message was laid before the Seuftte and the reading of It iVas begun. The close at tentionpaid to the message irom beginning to end by the Senate was remarked. On both sides of the chamber the Senators carefully noted every utterance ot the Executive, hen the President's very positive declarations upon the silver question were reached the sentiments of many Senators on that question oould be determined by their expressions of counte nance respectively. Those who agreed wit the President that the continued coinage of silver is an evil, exchanged nodsof while the believers in silver scowled and other w'.se manifested their disapproval. The t^esi dent's aggressive stand on the silver Question makes it now almost assured that this will be the first engrossing subject to come *>?fore 1ton cress. It is quite likely that legislation on this subject will be proposed lu the Senate at once, and it will certainly provoke along'?^fn the advecates of silver coinage are evidently no less determined than Its enemies. The reading was concluded at 1.52 p. m.. ana the message w;is, as Is customary, ordered printed and to Ue on the table. ? . The chair laid before the Senate the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury; also a statement from the secretary of the Court or | Claims showing the Judgments rendered by that court tor the past yuar; also a statement or the secretary of the Senate showing the receipts and expenditures of his office lor the past year. alien holders op public lands. The chair also laid before the Senate a me morial from the legislature of New Hampshire setting forth that twenty million acres of the lands of the United States are held by non resident aliens, principally by the titled and governing class of Great Britain; that such a system of land-holding is incompatible wittj the best interests of the people of the United States, and requests Cougress to pass legislation that may secure exclusively to the American people the public landsof the United States and preveut their sale to persons other than citizens and those intending to become such. The memorial was read and referred to the committee on public lands. MK.

BOTH THE PROTECTIONISTS AND TARIFF RE FORMED are claiming the President as their per sonal property. His expressions on the tariff' question are construed by each to be tavorable to their tueories. The protectionists are best pleased, however, as the free traders are disap pointed because out-and-out free trade ground was not taken. The republicans speak ot Ac tariff"clause as a better straddle than thatmaac in the democratic platform. THE 

SILVER MEN are very much disturbed by the, posi tive grounds in opposition to the silver doilaV taken in the message. One of the leading silver men on the democratic side thus described the policy of the administration: "No silver, no greenbacks, no sinking lund, a cordon of fortification about the country and a pension lor every one.'' THE HOUSE COMMITTEE on ordnance met t >day and had a hearing upon tho question of the ability of engineers in this country to make small engines of the greatest power. Representative Crisp, who is a member of the committee, says, in connection with their labors, t hat he is convinced that anything that can be made elsewhere can be made in this country.

The Charges of Perjury in Connection With It. This afternoon, in the Police Court, Assistant District Attorney Thomas called up the cases of periury alleged to have been committed In the hearing of the celebrated Belt divorce case in this city, as heretofore mentioned In The Star. He called up first, the case against Samuel Jackson, the special colored policeman. Jaekson, it is alleged, in giving his testimony betore Oommissioner Browning, swore- falsely that he bad carried notes to Mrs. Belt, then Mrs. Godfrey, for gentlemen, and that he-bad seen men and women going and coming from the house of Mrs. Wysong, where Mrs. Godfrey lived, at a late hour at night, etc. . Detctive Block, the first witness, read the. printed testimony of the defendant giVen before Commissioner Browning, in which he is quoted swearing that Mrs. Belt lived at Mrs Wy song's, 1607 L street, and was visited* there by Major Kilbourn aud Paymaster Stephenson, besides what is quoted above. Mr. Thomas then read from a paper show ing that Jackson reappoared and corrected his testimony,-saying "that he han been led into this thing blindfolded, and that his previous testimony was lalse and he knew nothing more than what Mr. Cunningham told hltn " Washington 8. Hurley, ex-lieutenant of 'po lice, testified that Jackson told him that he (Jackson) was on Cunningham's side and would get $50 in case they were successful Mr. Frank T. Browning, one of the commis sioners in the case, gave testimony as to the na ture of the proof in the ease and to a Dortion of the defendant's testimony. portion oi This closed the testimony against Jackson, and the court suspended judgment The next case called is that of Battlo Minnr .the allegations being similar to that in the P?? viou^oase.

Xe?tidK off the American Pabllc Health Association. When Br. James E. Reeves, of Wheeling:, W. Va.. president of the American Public Health association, mounted the platform atWlllard hall, a little alter 10 o'clock this morning,about en? hundred gentlemen were seated In the k< ill. There were as many more scattered about the rooms of the hotel near the hall. The hall was devoid of any special decoration for the oecaaWn. In the rear of the platflnrra were hung a number of charts illus trating some scheme ot sanitary statistics. Everything indicated that the association came here tor business, and not for pleasure. On tbe stage, where the associatidn assembled, besides the president, were seated Dr. Smith Townshend, of this city, chairman of the local committee; Dr. Irving A. Watson, of New Hampshire, secretary of the association, and Hou. Erast us Brooks, of New York, first vice president of the association. 

CALLED TO ORDER. The presldentcalled the association to oraer without making any preliminary speech. Dr. Townshend stated briefly the arrangements made by the local committee for the meeting and for the entertainment of members of the association. The secretary presented a number of reports of a routine character which occupied tbe at tention of the association for some time. A large number of new members was then elected and a list of members deceased since the St. Louis meeting of 1884. REPORTS. Surgeon Smart, U. S. A? of the committee on incorporation, reported that papers bad been prepared for incorporating tbe association under the laws of the United States and tbe District of Columbia. After some discussion it was decided to post pone action on the report and continue the committee for one year, owing to changes which tbe report involved in tbe constitution of the association. Dr. Goo. H. Rohe, or Baltimore, presented, in printed form, a lengthy report of the commit tee on disinfectants, which will be discussed on Thursday. Tne report of Dr. J.Berrien Lindsley, of Nash ville, Tenn., treasurer of the association, show ing an expenditure of $'2,233.10 and a balance of 31,105.03, was presented. "Now we are reafly for the papers." said Dr. Reeves, with a sigh of relief, when the mass of routine business bad been disposed of. READINQ THE PAPERS. The first paper read was on "Sanitary and Statistical Nomenclature," by Dr. R M. Hunt, secretary ot the state board of health, Trenton, N. J. It contained many interesting sugges tions as to restrictions to be placed upon the meaning of various terms used In sanitary re ports. OTHER PAPERS. The next paper presemed was by Dr. J. S. Billings, U. S. A., of this city, in which he sug gested changes and Improvements in "Forms of Tables for Vital Statistics." After tbe reading of Dr. Billings' paper time was given to tbe discussion of his paper and also Dr. Hunt's paper. Dr. Henry B. Baker, secretary of the state board of health of Lansing, read an interesting paper on "The Relations ol Rainfall fcnd Water Supply to Cholera." Dr. llaker's paper was illustrated by a num ber of statistical tables and diagrams ba>ed upon the statistics of cholera in Calcutta, India, from 1805 to 1884, inclusive, and the meteoro logical reports for the same period. These tables showed that cholera aud rainfall bore a statistical relation,_ the mortality being greater in seasons of little rain, ana vice-versa. The tables 6howed also that the mortality was greatly reduced upon the introduction in modern years of a good water supply. Tbe doctor thought that If a supply of good water had such effect as ap peared by this comparison upon cholera in Its nome, sanitarians here could use the knowledge thus gaiued in their efforts to prevent tbe ap pearance of cholera. , , Dr. D. E. salmon, D. V. S. of this city, read a paper on "Tbe Virus of Hog cholera. The , paper drew out, a very interesting discussion, ; which was participated in by Dr. Smith, of i York; Dr. Salmon, Dr. Bryce, ol Canada; Dr. i Germer, of Erie, Pa.; Dr. Kennedy, of Iowa; Dr. Cox, of St. Louis; Dr. Carl Hprsch, of New Hampshire; Dr. Jenner, of Detroit and others. Dr. Reed ottered a resolution, which was re ferred to the executive committee, urging Im mediate legislation, national, state and mu nicipal for the protection of the people from the sale of diseased meat. ' The next paper whs read by Dr. Charles H. Fisher, secretary ot the su*te board ot health i ol Providence, It. I., his subject being "Statistics of Consumption in Rhode island for a quarter of a Century." THE ADVISORY COUNCIL.

Hil debrant <& Morrison, attorneys for Naval Cadet Henry A.,W Hey, say that he did not petition the Pres dent for a pardon. They say: "The facts are, Wiley was tried by a court-martial on a charge of hazing a candidate for admission to tbe academy and found guilty, and Secretary Whitney dismissed him from tbe service on the 15th of September last. As his attorneys, Messrs. Hlldebrant?t Morrison presented a peti tion to the Secretary of the Navy tor a review, claiming that tbe court martial had no juris diction to try Cadet Wiley, because the facta showed the offense not to be one coming under the regulations ot the academy, made In pur suance of the statute. The Secretary submitted the question to the Attorney General, who, on a full aud careful examination, held the point to be well taken. The result was tnat Wiley was held not to have been dismissed at all and that be was still a cadet. There was nothing left to be done but to order Wiley back to duty, which the Secretary did on Tuesday of last week, and the cadet fa now at his post.

NATIONAL FINANCES. REPORT OF SECRETARY MANNING* IMPOBTAHT RECOMMENDATIONS. The C?rre??y Qumtlon Thoroughly Review**?The f?(n?tPor Slh fr Dol li,r**h??H he Stopped, and the te*al Tender Art Repealed-The Tariff <|ae?tlrat Etc. Hon. Daniel Manning, the Secretary of the Treasury, in bis annual report states that- the surplus of receipts over expenditures for the last fiscal year amounts to $17,859,735.84. As compared with the fiscal year 1884 the receipts for 1885 have decreased $24,829,103.54. In the custom receipts this decrease amounts to f13,595,550.42; internal revenue, $9,087,346. 97; sales of public lands, $4,104,718.57; tax on natloual banks, $194,507.88; sales of government property, $243,75*2.67; revenues of the District of Columbia, $41, 428.02, and other items. There was au in crease in the expenditures of $16,100,690.78, as follows: War department, $3,240,975.11; Interior department?Indians, $76,495.34; In terior department?pensions, $673,039.43; civil and miscellaneous, $16,573,824.68. The de crease in th#expenditure of the Navy depart^ meat, and the Interest on the public debt amounted to over four millions. The estimated surplus for the fiscal year, 1886, of receipt* over expenditures Is $24,250,000. For tno vear 1887 the estimated deficit is #24.589, 552.34. Dunn? the year ended October 31st, 1885, the reduction In the anntttl int?r?t charge In the public debt amounted to $309, 050.50. THE LAWS WHICH DISORDER THE CURRENCY. j The report calls attention to the disorder of the currency rising from the coinage act of 1878, which "is overloading the mints with unissued, the sub-treasuries with returned sil ver dollars, and will unavoidably convert the funds of the Treasury Into those depreciated and depreciating coins." Also, the disorders to the eurrencv arising from the "act of May 31,1878, which indefinitely postponed fulfil ment of the solemn pledge (March 18, 1809,) not only of'redemption' but also of 'paymeut Of all the obligations of the United States not bearing interest, legalized as $346,000,000 paper money of unlimited legal tender, and re quired the jiost-redemption issue and reissue of these promises to pay dollars, as equivalents of oar monetary unit," ... The Secretary suggests that reform could be promoted wltn advantage by "repeal of the clause requiring Treasurypurchases of silver bullion, and repeal of the act mating compul sory Treasury issues and reissues of the legal tender notes." THE UNITED STATES MUST STOP COINING SIL VER. In discussing the practical use of silver and gold as coin, the Secretary says: "Everybody Is a ^wo-metallist, and wishes the use of silver in fractional coins of at least a limited legal tender. Rl-metalllsts desire a larger use ot sil ver for coins of unlimited legal tender; but they also wish the use of gold in coins of unlimited legal tender. ? ? * * * In but one way now can any nation retain In use coins of both metals which are both unlim ited legal tender; namely, by stopping the coinage of the metal unacceptable to other na tions. France has done so. The United States must likewise stop coining silver. Stop, wait, negotiate. And whether negotiations shall suc ceed or fail, there is still no other way than to stop where we are, namely at the point where a risk begins to appear of difficulty in retaiulng silver in our home circulation In full equiva lence with our gold unit of value which has an international circulation." The report states that the 215,000,000 of silver dollars are here, and cannot be expected to sensibiy decrease. They cannot go abn^ad on account of their legal tender character. Nobodj* will melt them, as the silver melted is worth 20 to 25 per cent less than the silver minted. No silver to be used in the arts and industries will be drawn from this stock. It is not expected that Counress will withdraw from these silver dollars their lull tender Quality, or redeem and melt them and sell the metal. "The lact is," continues the Secretary, "WE CANNOT BUT Br. TW>*-META LLISTS." * * * "If the facts of our owu monetary j situation have been correctly ascertained and j stated above, then it is now obvious that gold and silver monometallism may, without preju- : dice to their high rank as monetary theories, i be set aside at once as theories practically In-I applicable, at the present moment, lor the i guidance of the United States.'' The report gives an analyst's of our coinage j laws in detail, and an explanation of the cir cumstance* under which tney were adopted. The equivalence of the siiver dollar In domestic trade is now imperilled by thu continued coin age and increasing numbers ?if the silver dol- j lars. The stoppage of the coinage js urged by , the business voice oi the country, 'l'ne choice j of Congress in the opinion of the Sccre- . tary is not between silver monomet- ] alism and gold inonometalism, not between ( bimetallism and either gold or silver mouomet allism, but "between stopping the coinage of silver dollars, or risking by further coinage the j Inequivalence of those dollars with our moue t-arv unit, risking the fall of the value of 'Jl'v 000,000 silver dollars iroin their legal domestic rating to their commercial International value which Is'JO per cent less, and Involving sueu ,t disuse in our domestic trade of 550,000.000 dollars of gold coin, as when gold was ejected by paper during the war." Iu discussing the question of coining a heavier j dollar, the Secretary says it is proposed to treat silver as a commodity. It. however, the silver of the dollar Is to be dealt with as part oi the monetary metal of the world, 371.25 grains ot fine silver can be made equivalent with 23.22 grains of tine gold as effectually as 500 grains of fine silver can. The report then goes on to show that stopping the coinage will not affect . prices, and that a poorer dollar reduces the wages of labor. THE 

TARIFE Ql'ESTION. The Secretary then takes up the subjeet of reform iu taxation, and states tnat like the currency laws, the tariff laws are a legacy of ! war. "As nothing in the ordinary course of business Is Imported unless the price here of j the domestic, as well as ot the imported, article 's higher by the amount of the duty aud the cost of sca-'trausit than the price abroad, the preference of the tax-payer for duties upon aril- | cles not produced in the United States is Justified i by the lact that such dfltles cost him no more than the Treasury ol his country gets. As for ! duties affecting articles that are also produced in ihe United States, the first to be sale ^dis carded are those upon materials used by* our own mannfocturers. which now subject them to a hopeless competition at home and abroad, with the manufacturing nations, none of which taxes-raw materials. It is not to i?e doubted that in any reform which shall finally receive the approval of the two houses of Con gross, tbty will in&turoly consider jilhI la\ or ably regard ilie interests which can only grad ually and carefully be adjusted, without loss, to changes In the legislative conditions tor tlieir advancing prosperity. With this view, 1 have invited, in some two thousand circular letters to our manufacturers and merchants, their en llghteued cooperatibn in the improvement of our fiscal lwlicy, and the replies received will hereafter be submitted to the consideration ot Congress- > INTERNAL REVENUE. The Secretary endorses the recommendation ot the commissioner of internal revenue as to an amendment of the law postponing the col lection of the tax upon dlsi illed spirits under certain conditions until withdrawal for con sumption. He also concurs in the. recommen dations as to the abolition of the office of Inspector of tobacco, whose fees are an unneces sary tax upon bu iness. He thinks thai an increase in the number ot internal revenue agents should be made. BUREAU OF ENGRAVING} AND PRINTING. The report states that in accordance with the wise policy of Congress in late years, the Secre tary submits specific estimates for the bureau of engraving and printing, fixing the number and salaries of the persons employed and the amount to be expended lor plate printing and materials. He adds: "By thus limiting the number of employes, any-possibllity of urfduly increasing the force will be avoided, while the status o! the bureau as a part of the regular organization of the department wfll be defiuitely fixed. The amount estimated tor is $124,498.70 less than the quantity ol work which it is proposed to pro duce would have cost at the rates which pre vailed in the last fiscal year. In the absence of anv action by Congress on the subject, it has been assumed in making the estimate that the urlntlnE of one and tw^dollar notes will be resumed at the usual rates. Should it be de ctdedto discontinue those denominations, the appropriation should be proportionately re duced. the immigration act. In regard to immigration commissioners, at the ports of the country, the re port recommends that the existing law be amended so as to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint the memberdlrectly instead a. now of approving th?ie nominated by the governors of the states. It instated that a draft of a bill will soon be mesented to Congress embodying amendment* to th" existing immigration act. A HALL or RECORDS. The Secretary renews the recommendation Qf his predecessor, that a suitable building tor the storage of the files and records of the several departments be constructed. The Secretary in concluding his report says that the necessity for a statute of limitation upon the present*-, uEifol demands against the United States be comes more apparent every year. the collection or dutms. Attached to the annual report of the Secre tary of the Treasury is a report upon the pres ent system of collection of duties, which en hndies the suggestions contained in the'replies nf t^e iocal offioers and also district at Srneys to a circular addressed to them in August last by the Secretary in regard m the condition of the custom districts and tXftir needs.
