Letter from Leesburg. Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette. Lkesburg, Va., Nov. 30.?Does is not strike vou as a singular fact, that, in this our time '0[ greatest need, all our old national leaders ar? dead, and that there is no man now be fore the public eye, .rbo is looked to as a leader of the masses.of the people? I see vou still have confidence in the peo ple, especially in the people of Virginia. I can only say, that, if our people are a crite rion by which to judge those of Virginia, they do not seem to have confidence in them selves. All we can say is, that in the Union we have enjoyed a degree of happiness, prosperity, and respectability that no people jiave ever before been blessed with; that from a feeble- band of o,000.000, we have, in 70 years, reached the magnificent number of 30,000,000; and that, under its fostering v-are and protecting flag, our commerce is second to that of but one nation on the face of the globe. We can see all this when we look back ; but when we look forward, all is chaos. One only hope suggests itself to every jjiiud, and we look up hopefully to the Al mighty Kuler of Nations, with the simpie trust that "man's extremity is Gytl's oppor tunity." As to the temper of our people, there is no excitement: but there in a deep feeling of dissatisfaction with the doings of most of the Northern States. We are defeudmg our rights of prosperity, and can take no step backward without surrendering everything; thev are the aggressors, and can, without Joss, retract?ana it must be done, or worse will come of it. 1 think tiie L >udoun meeting of December. Court will be a large one, aod will give a fair expression of the mind of the county. A few town items may not be unaccept able :? At this time last year, there was not a vacant house in town, and now there are five comfortable houses lor rent. I hope they will remain idle no longer than New Year's Day, which is a common time among us for moving. I notice homespun as not an uncommon article of dress fv>r persons of means, who have not worn it since the days of their boy hood. This, I take it, is a step in the right direction, for when we are self dependent, we will be independent, and nut before. I I do not perceive in the dress of the ladies any particular change in the character of the material, but they look so handsome, I sup pose they may be allowed the extravagance, if such it be in reality, for some good judges have said that the best clothes are the cheap est. They are the ouly gay looking objects we meet with, and I suppose our present and future prospects in this life are only made tolerable by their presence. In this connec tion, 1 will add, that the number of mar riage licences issued so far this year, is 77, being S more than fur the whole of last year, butJargely behind the average for leap year. As there is only a month remaining, I am afraid that they will hardly roach the average. Mr. Pickett has put up, this year, a brick building, three-stories high, 24 by 40, and Is now engaged in paying the foundations of another, 24 by 75, which, with the new wash-houso aud servauts' room, will at least double his accommodation {or guests. A new barber has also set up shop at the '"Pickett House," who will prove a desirable acquisition to the comforts and convenience of the old burg. Thero are several eases of typhoid fever in town, but I believe they are not of a ma Wgcaat character. Col. Morgan's election, in Clarke county, is gratifying to many of us who oppose him in his genornl politics. lie is a man largely interested in both laud and slaves, whoso interests will bo as much affected as those of any man in the community, and who, therefore, can safely be trusted to act calmly and considerately in the present emergency. A LIQuIS. Letter from Georgetown, 3. u. Cjrrs3poiidence of the Alexandria Gazette. There is nothing hero but Secession dream ed of, or talked of. For weeks we have been 1g the midst of public dinners and meetings. Three last week, and speaking in the court house, last uight. All are for Secession. The vote of the ladies was tak?n in the meeting last night, and 'Ho a man' they voted to be rather the widows of Secessionists than the wives of "Submissionists." There was a ?meeting here last week to nominate dele gates to the convention, and eight were ap pointed a committee to make nominations, and of the eighr; three were ministers. We iiave a rifle corps here of 70 men, and our representative, P. C. J. Weston, a rice plan ter, has made ihem a present of 100 ininnie rifles, $3,500, and a Whitworth Gun,$1,500, besides smaller contributions. We have also an artillery company of G4 men, and Gov. Gist has just sent them a battery of six guns; and three rice planters have sent them their checks fur S2O0 a piece. Then we have a try op called the Marion Light Troop of 52 men, to which I belong. We had a present of $250 lair week, and it we do have to fight, we will be ready to do so. Our .Railroad is still pushing on and will not stop. All other business is at a standstill. The Banks will aot discount, although a bill has passed ??ur Legislature legalizing the action of the banks in refusing specie. All the Turpen zioe, Rosin, Cotton and Rice are being stor ed: &i3d the Banks lay over all Northern Dotes without protesting them. The Law yers won't sue on Northern paper, and every wbere the Pulmetto Hag is living.

Meeting in BicuroRD.?A large meeting of the citizens of BcJiord county, VaM irres pective or party, was held on the 2Glh of November, to deliberate upon the distracted condition of the country. Hon. Win. L. Goggin, chairman of the committee appoint ed for the purpose, reported a series or reso- . lutions, asserting that the time has come whon the rights of Southern men aud the dignity of Southern States demand the re peal of all obnoxious measures and laws en acted and adopted by Northern States to prevent a proper execution of the Fugitive Siave Law, and taking strong ground against the exercise of Congressional power to regu late commcrce among the several States, so as to destroy or in anywise impair the value of any species of property whatever, declar ing that no such power can be exercised ha ving that effect, either immediately or remote ly in any District or Territory of the United States. We copy three of the resolutions: That whatever ditforoneoi or opinion exist now, or may have ex5sted heretofore, in respect to par ticular measures of general policy?ami while wc differ now, and inny have been heretofore divided* in our views as to the choice of inon for high poli tical stations?and though we may not be agreed in regard to certain questions alluding the autho rity of the several States and the powers of the General Government in other respects, yet upon the subjects to which wc have adverted, we pres ent but one undivided front now, as we shall at all times hereafior, in any invasion of our rights involved therein, or in any struggle whi<-h may ensue, to support and maintain them when they are endangered. That wo shall ever cherish an ardent attach ment for the Union of these States so lowg as that Union secures t* us blessings it was designed to confer by its formation: and in the hopo of future harmony, and with a view to our national happi ness, peace aud prosperity, we pledge ourselves to its support, if our rights shall bo hereafter proper ly respected. That, appealing as wo do to a source of justice? to our own rights, and to that uuit}- which consti tute us as one people for national purposes, we ask that all action looking to disunion or secession ha suspended for the preseut, tru>tiug that reason and rellection may be substituted for hasty and in - cousidorate resolves, in all sections, both North and South. Another resolution urges a Convention ot the States, and it is suggested that such Convention, if called, be held as speedily as possible in the city of Lexington, in the State ofKentucky. The resolutions were advocated by Messrs. Goggin, Burwell and others, and unanimous ly adopted. . The following, offered by Dr. R. A. Clement, was also adopted, with a few dissenting voices: Kesolved, That having entire confidence iu the integrity aud patriotism of our Representatives in tho State Legislature, wo authorize them, in the event the mode of redress embraced in the forego ing resolutions shall prove inadequate to the cri sis, to adopt any other measures consistent with the principles and purposes of the resolutions. "Hitched on and Dragged."?The more we think over this elegant and classical ex pression. a few weeks since given out by our esteemed cotemporary of the Richmond En quirer. the more we don't like it. It con veys to the mind the idea of a stubborn cur being "hitched on" to the coupling polo of ;t wagon, and "dragged" along almost at th.j expense ot his neck, nolens colrns. It, too, might fairly be construed as a serious re flection upon the intelligence, manhood and independence of the people of Virginia, who could be "hitched on" and "dragged into :i common destiny" with the Cotton States, no matter what might be their desire. To subor dinate every consideration of princ'pie and every instinct of sovereignty to an imagine ! community of commercial interests, is pro gressing a degree backwards in the science of government, as well as of morals and let ters, scarcely assimilative to the spirit of this progressive age. To assume that the people of Virginia are mere anatomical structures, animal eutities, devoid of the power of voli tion uud divested of the natural attributes of mind, is presuming upon the credulity and stupidity of our species to a point where its absurdity becomes transparent. The people of Virginia "hitched on"?strapped to--for the purpose, willing or not. of being 'drag ged into' the mad and reckless schemes of South Carolina! Why, before we would sub mit to such humiliation anil degradation, we would raise the- flag of the sovereignty of Wes tern Virginia, and resist to the death the de struction and absorption of our sovereign and independent rights?our God-given and con stitution guarantied privileges and immuni ties. Virginia is sovereign and "hitched on" o ^ to the "common destiny" ot no power, until she so determines for herself.?Stan n ton Vin dicator. The Census.?The population of tho State of New Jersey is a fraction over 650,000.? The increase of population in ten years is about 170,009. Michigan has 740,960: increase in ten years, 352,315. Massachusetts .has 1,231,407; an increase of 24 percent., or iu per tout. le.?s than the in crease during the previous ton years, from IS40 to 1850. The census of Georgia shows a population of 1,075,077, an increase of 01,550 > ince 1850. Thirty counties show a loss and ninety-eight counties a grain. Tho population of Kentucky, according to the returns of the U. S. Marshal, is 1,150, 000, which is an increase of i7 per cent, in the last ten years. The complete census returns ofXew York city, according to the city papers, show a population of 814 2/7. This is the city pro per. The increase in five years is 284,427, which is an average of nearly 57,000 per anuum. The census shows that the annual increase in the population of the United Slates since 1700 is about three per cent. Jn 1715, the population of the colonies was 482,000, of whom 5S,5l'0 were negro slaves. The pre sent population is about oO,000,000, of whom about 4,000,000 are negroes. Our public schools are attended by 4,000,000 of children: we owe about $200,000,000, ? of which $90. 000,000 are held by foreigners. It takes 750 paper mills and 2,000 steam engines to sup ply our publishers aud newspapers with printing paper, at a cost of $2< .000,000 per annum. Russia Pavs Up.?During the Crimean was the Russian Government, through irs agents, made a contract with Capt. Perkins, of Worcester, Mass., for a supply of powder, revolvers, and breach-loading rifles, to be smuggled in to Russia by way of the German ports, in concealed cotton-bales and casks of rice. The scheme was discovered, and peace having been declared, the Russian broke the contract. Capt. Perkins laid his claim be fore the State Department and a diplomatic correspondence ensued, during which Attor ney General Black sustained the claimant.? His agent, Mr. Stewart, it is said, went to St. j Petersburg last summer, and that, with ihe J aid of Mr. Appleton, our Minister at St. Pe- j tersburg, he has obtaiued v>o85, 000.?

Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina, moved that the Senate take a recess for half an hour. Mr. Green, of Missouri,?Oh no, adjourn. Mr. Seward, ol New York, moved that the Senate adjourn. Mr. Clingman thought it might be treat ing tho President with disrespect to send a committee to him and adjourn before that committee returned. Mr. Seward said lie had not mado tho mo tion unadvisedly, lie knew informally, but certainly, that, the message would not be com municated to Congress until to-morrow. The motion was agreed to, and the Senate adjourned. House of Representatives. The House met at 12 o'clock?and being called to order by tho Speaker, Hon. \Ym. Pennington, of N.

Mr. Phelps said that the gentleman from Pennsylvania could call up the motion any other day, and it should not now be insisted on, as several members were absent. Mr. Grow explained that his reason for calling up the motion now was that they might have the business before the House, for gentlemen knew that there were special or ders for the first three or four weeks, this session.

It is reported that Senator Seward will take the earliest opportunity to introduce in the Senate a bill restoring the Missouri compro mise line, extending ir. to the Pacific, and ai the same time make a strung conservative speech. The South Americans in Congress will go for Union, and Mr. Bouligny, of Louisiana, wiil make a strong speech on the subject. Senator D uglas has sent- fc>r Gov.

There was but J one jury case tried?that of Daan vs. Keys j for unlawful detainer. The jury sworn to , tr}r whether tho property was unlawfully ; held from the plaintiff, gave judgment, ae j cordingljT-and for costs. There were no i Commonwealth's cases, and only a few civil i cases continued. Two or three administra ! tiotis were granted. The Court authorized Thus. Whittiugton, sealer and inspector of weights and mea sures, to purchase fur the use of the county, sets of United States standard dry and wine measures, of cupper or pewter, and a set of standard weights of copper or iron.? These weights will, as we have heretofore anouuneed, supercede the old English Ex chequer standards of 1744, so long in use iu this city. The Court also ordered John Skidmore to be discharged from the jail of the county. Application from the Alexandria Canal Company to be relieved from the payment of certain taxes to them assessed, was granted. Key'.

Dr. delivers this lecture in consequence of the repeated solici tations of some of our must influential and rospected citizens, and we promise to all who contemplate attending, the enjoyment of a delightful evening. In thus, &o courteously responding to the request made of him, Dr. Dana but exhibits another instance of his desire to profit his friends, even at personal inconvienee. Of ripe judgement, cultivated experience and superior attainments, he can nut but render to his audience, useful infur mation and an intellectual treat. Pl'umc Meeting in Fairfax County.? An adjourned meefing of the citizens of Fair fax cuuuty was held at the Court House on Saturday last, but owing to the inclemency of the weather, a smaller number attended than would otherwise have been the ease.? Tho chairman, T. R. Love, esq., being ab sent from tho county, Alfred Moss, esq., was called to preside, John T. Burke continuing to act as secretary. As the committee uf nine who had been appointed tu draft resolutiuns for the consideration of the meeting could not agree, two sets of resolutions were proposed differing essentially in their texts. Those offered by Maj. II. W. Thomas, and suppor ted by himself and W. II. Dulany, esq., be ing highly conservative iu'tbeir tune, while those proposed and advocated by Thos. J. Murray, esq., supported more ultra Southern views. After the adoption of Mr. Murray's resolutions, the meeting adjourned. \ Fugitive Slave Case.?In Washington on Saturday, the ease of Capt. Nathan Dar ling, who was charged with resisting officers Wise and Gittings iu arresting a colored man named Stafford, under the fugitive slave law, came up for trial. Judge Granger ap neared, and his evidence exonerated Capt. Darling from any blame in the matter.? This was the first case, under the fugitive slave law, in tho District, of Columbia, and the magistrates, Justices Donn aud Giber sou, fully acquitted Capt. Darling. November Marriages.?During the month November, the Clerk ot the Alexandria Coun ty Court granted eight marriage licenses.? All the gentlemen parties to the licenses were over twenty-one years of ago as were six of the ladies'. The licenses of November for the past three years have been as fol lows: 1857, 10; 1858. 3; 1859, G: the average of the month since lo52 being 9 G-t. Thus it will be perceived that the issue of the past month foils considerably below the average. Sisters of Chariit.?A number of Sis ters of Charity, attired in the habit of their order, passed through this city, last night, on the Southwestern line, cn route to ^ew Orleans. They propose to-exerci.se their no ble mission in that city, having left the Mother House iu New York for that pur pose. Alexandria Jail.?The jail of this couu ty received but one person charged with crime?larceny?during the month of No vember. This person, a white woman, is now the only inhabitant of the criminal ward of the jail. This indicates an absence of crime in the community which is very gratifying. Monument.?The monument to the mem ory of Rev. J. E. Blox, a description of which we gave some time since, was raised on Sat urday in front of St. Mary's church on Ko>> :tl Street, and adds much to the appearance of the neighborhood. ?

"Washington Affairs?-Congress?-Secession Proposals for Harmony?Caucuses. [Special lijspatch to tho Gazette.] Washington) fDec. 3.?The session of Congress opened most quietly. Those who expected a scene were disappointed, for sel dom in the calmest times has there been less apparent excitement. To all appearances the opening of the second session of this Congress compares very favorably, with the opening of the first session last year, when immediately upon the heel of the John Brown Raid, Southern men met their Northern associates, and opened at once a violent sec tional contest; in the Senate on the John Brown Raid, and in the House upon the Helper book. The members on the South ern side of tho House seemed indeed rather disposed to merriment. Every one feels, however, that a crisis is upon the country and all talk of it. With the exception of the bankrupt condition of the Treasury, it has driven everything from the tapis of political circles. The fear, how ever, is not without hope. Prominent men on both sides are named as anxious to proposes measures of relief. Senator Hun ter is said to be prominent among Southern members in this desire, and it is proclaimed in so many high quarters that, credence is given to it, that, Wm. H. Seward will pro pose a plan of adjustment acceptable to the South. Those hopeful of the Union, one more sanguine to-day than they have been before, since the election of Lincoln. The Gulf State members generally- still think dissolution inevitable, and say to sug gestions of a settlement of the difficulties: "It is too late, the day for compromises is past." There can be no doubt that very soon, it may be even to-morrow, resolutions looking to the pacification of tho country, will be introduced into the House, backed by a con servative power, respectable in numbers, and conservative in antecedents. After this experiment upon the temper of the House has been tried, prudent men will be able to make their calculations with more accuracy. At present, the, most sagacious are bafHed in all efforts to read aright the "signs of the times." No credit, however, is given to the idea that there will be an internecine quarrel among the Southern delegates in Congress. The suggestion is as unjust to them, as its fulfilment would be insulting to their constituents. The President's Message will be deliver ed to the public at 1 o'clock precisely. It is said upon excellent authority, that the Hon. Wm. C. liives, of Virginia, will be ottered a place in the cabinet of the incom ing President. in the Senate, to-day, neither South Caro lina, Georgia, nor Louisiana, were represen ted. South Carolina will remain without Senators, but the Louisiana Senators will be here shortly, and it is said that Mr. Toombs will take his seat. The city is quite busy to-night, there are two or three political caucuses in progress, the proceedings of which have not trans pired. From Washington. Washington, Dec. o P. M.?Several South eru delegations are in secret consultation to nigh* with the object it is believed of securing the co-operation of the border slave-States in the .secession movement. Whiie some Republicans affect to believe that South Carolina only will secede, others are begining to be alarmed; even Sumner to day said privately that there was danger of the secession movement spreading. The President'w message will, it is thought ofiend the South ou account of its position against secession and offend the North by its condemnation of the personal liberty bills. Persons claimiug to be well posted say that the President will recommend a general convention with a view to the adjustment of the present difficulties. It is evident that the Administration fears trouble in the enforcement of the Federal laws. Notwithstanding there was a studied courtesy and cordiality to-day, between the members from the extreme sections of the confederacy, a close observer could not fail occasionally to observe flashes ofindignation from those from the Cotton States foretelling the coming storm. An Abolition Meeting Broken Up. Boston, Dec. 3.?The abolitionists of this place called a meeting to-day, to be held at Masonic Temple for the purposo of commem orating the death of John Brown. The tem ple w;vs. taken possession of by Union men, who chose Mr. Itiohard Sullivan Fay, Chair man and passed a series of resolutions de nouncing John Brown and his coadjutors, justifying his execution, and lauding Yirgiu ia for the course pursued by hor in reference to those mad fanatics. Fred Douglas, James lledpath, Frank Sanborn and other well known Abolitionists vainly endeavored to obtain a hearing. There was much confu sion and the police was called in, when the llall was cleared and closed by order of the Mayor, Singular Accident. Newark, N. J., Dec,, 2.?A man named John Murray, living on Madison street, iu ?his city, on Saturday evening placed the muzzle of a loaded gun barrel, detached from the stock, to his mouth, and while blowing into it the breach came in contact with a lighted candle, discharging the weapon, M nr? ray's head was blown off and portions of his skull and brains scattered about the room. The barrel rebounded, and striking his moth er-in-law, ten feet distant, penetrated four inches into lier chest. It is believed she can not survive. Arrival of the California Staamer. New York, Nov.

Augusta, Deo. 3.?All the banks iu this city have taken advantage of the recently enacted law and suspended this morning.? They have fixed the maximum rate of dis c uut on New York sight bills at 3 per cent. j : ?* 7' ' w ~ T ' " " : A Proposition, for Quieting the Present Polit ical excitement: Washington, Dec. 3.?Among the numer ous propositions with the view of endeavor iogto quiet the present political e*ilsf is one proposing that the Representatives of all the Southern States, South Carolina excepted, shall have a conference and prepare a list of their grievances, and state what will satisfy them as a remedy. This is then to be sub mitted to the conservative Republicans, and, if it meet with sufficient favor from them, then, after the reading of the President's Message, that part having reference to our political troubles to be referred to a commit tee of one from each State. This proposition is being discussed to-day, and it, is said that several prominent Republicans have already acquiesced in it. The United States Supreme Court met to day in their new Chamber at noon. Chief Justice Taney and all the associate Judges, except Judge Wayne, were present. The Court soon adjourned, and the mem bers proceeded to the White House, and per sonally paid their respects to the President, and afterwards left their oards for the Vice President. Later from California. Fort Kearney, Dec. 2d.?The Pony Ex press passed here at 4 o'clock this morning, with San Francisco dates to Nov. 21. The election returns are not? quite com plete.?The total vote is divided as fellows: Lincoln, 38,64G; Douglas, 37,349; Breckin ridge, 33,357; Bell, 8,4G7. The vote of tho State cannot exceed 113,500 and Lincoln is generally conceded to have a plurality of 700 to 1000. The latest returns from all the counties of Oregon, give Lincoln 318 majority over Breckinridge, and Douglas is number threo in the race. GreatKnxiety exists in California for furth er Eastern intelligence. The latest dates from St. Louis are to the 8th instant. The Pony Express, with dates to the 11th, has not ar rived, though overdue. The late storm caused much damage in the interior of the State. Manv flumes and ditches-were seriously injured, houses un roofed, fences blown down, &c. One of tho big trees of California, measuring36 feet in diameter, is prostrated. Mr. Shannon, editor of the Visalia Delta, and Wm. Governor Morris, a lawyer, resid ing in the same town, had a rencontre grow ing out of a political controversy on the 15th during which Mr. Shannon was killod, after the parties had fired several shots. Mr. Mor ris was acquitted, on the ground that he act ed in self defence. / ? The yield of the Fremont gold mines for the past two weeks is stated by the manag ers at $32,000. Accounts from Lower California state that the band of fillibusters who have been com mitting murders and robberies in the Penin sula, are all driven out, leaving the country quiet. A ton of ore from five different leads in the new Cosa districts has arrived here, and is undergoing tho test. The owners aro san guine that the investigation will show tho silver region of Sierra Nevada to bo tho best aud most extensive in the world. The Georgia Legislature. Milledgeville, Dec. 1.?A motion was made to-day to amend the retaliatory bill as follows: "And whereas, a compact broken by ono party is no longer binding, politically, social ly, morally, or legally, upon the other par ties to it; An whereas, in the opinion of this General Assembly, the States enumerated in the bill have grossly violated the compact of this Union, by refusing to deliver _up fugitives; Therefore, Be it enacted, That the State of Georgia will withdraw its confederated faith from all the States which interpose obstacles to tho re covery of our rights under the Constitution; and hereby Be it further enacted and decreed, That all officers in this State, civil or military, who have taken aii oath to support the Constitu tion of the U. S., are hereby relieved and ab solved from their obligations from fcuclt oaths: as well as all cases in the courts of this State where the States or citizens of those States who refuse our constitutional rights are parties or otherwise concerned. This amendmeut was lost?ayes 30, nays 89. Tho retaliatory bill, however, passed the House. Farther from Kansas. Warsaw, Dec. 2.?Gen. Frost's brigade cncamped last night betweon Calhoun and Belmont.?They are moving slowly, having become foot-sore from marching on tho rough roads. Gen. Parson passed through Calhoun yes terday on a secret mission to the border. At the last accounts Montgomery was on camped near Fort Scott, and defied the world to take him. It is thought that he will leave when he hears of tho approach of Gen. Har ney and Gen. Frost. The people in all the border counties strongly endorse the action of Gov. Stewart in sending out troops. If they can only catch Montgomery, a general day of thanksgiviug will be held, in the Osage valley. Gen. Frost's command will encamp to night at Calhoun. Two suspicious charac ters, supposed to be Montgomery's spies, were seen yesterday in tho northern part of Henry county, making tracks in the direc tion of Fort Scott. Montgomery's men are all through tho couutry giving out reports to mislead the people" These frequent outrages in the We&fc by Abolition bands, is kindling in that section a strong disunion spirit.
