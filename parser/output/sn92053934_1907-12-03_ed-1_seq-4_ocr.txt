With Bryan as the most prominent character outside of official life in Washington at the opening of congress and with the retention of John Sharp Williams, who lias recently come out for Bryan's renonilnation for the pres idency, the democrats aided bv the able generalship of Senator Charles A. Culberson on the Hoor or the upper house, are entering upon a career that promises much at the outset of a na tional campaign year. ,A press dispatch was received at this office yesterday stating that Gov ernor Deneen has been dickering with Governor Hughes to deliver the Illinois presidential delegation to the latter if Deneen can connect with the nomination for vice president. The dispatch states further that Deneen is opposing the Cannon boom, and for that reason is insisting on a pri mary, bill containing a provision for the popular vote on presidential can didates through the selection of dele gates to the national convention. The ltooKevoltian Message. The message of President Theodore RontU'Vt'lt rp.id in th( first sptminn nf the Grtth congress today is one of the most voluminous documents ever sub mitted by a nation's chief to that dis tinguished body, and yet it embodies nothing particularly striking in sug gestion or recommendation that has not been contained in former messages submitted by the present executive. U is strictly Rooseveltian in character being vigorous in tone and employing the simplest language, launching into the discussion of national problems and questions at the very outset with "out wordy Introduction and concluding abruptly without perroration or review. The president holds that the repub lic is fuM.iamentally sound, although serious differences exist on matters of national policy that have bred sore spots. He stands for frankness in dealing with national and international questions, maintaining that dishoisty must be eliminated even though the innocent suffer; advocates numerous forms of remedial legislation, relative to currency, chief of which is more elasticity; reiterates his denunciation of trusts and monopolies but does not exactly open the way to effectually abolish them. The Inheritance and income tax rec omniendations are among the strong est propositions that afe presented in the : message. President Roosevelt takes a positive stand for the proper development and maintainance of in land waterways, in which connection the deep water proposition as it ap plies to the Mississippi receives hon orable mention. - He makes plea for a larger navy, and while he responds to the appeal of the publishers of the United States for . the repeal of the wood pulp duty as the only basis of relief from the oppressions of the rob ber paper trust, "and makes the proper recommendations relating to the same, he stands pat on the evil that is at the bottom " of all trust organization and holds that the tariff should not be disturbed until after the presidential election. t' The White House lottery. . St. Louis Republic: ' The White house ' jiu-jitsu 'exercises havln passed -Into history along witn the lowavprize fight which was pulled off under the refined and euphemistic name of a boxing match," we have a new sensation involving the ques . tlon whether' the president of the United States is the only man in the United States who can conduct a lot tciy without getting .himself indicted by a federal grand jury. The property which President Roosevelt disposed of to the tvo jealous senators from South Dakota Is highly valuable. The government' of the United States pays large sums of money annually- for its maintenance. It seems to be up to the prosecuting attorney of the District of Columbia tb-j make up his mind whether in awarding It by the flip-of a coin and the draw ing of the long slip and the short slip the president has violated the federal law which unmistakably forbids that sort of thing to the ordinary citizen. For the president it was the easy way out of an embarrassing situation. But the easy way is not always the lawful way. All parties engaged in the gamble are satisfied except-' Senator Gamble, who did not live up to his name, since Senator Klttredge had the best of the luck and got the juiciest of the patronage plums dealt out to South Dakota. But so eminent an authority on eth ics and law as the president poses to be ought to question his conscience closely as to whether In choosing the easy way in this instance he has not violated both moral and statutory law. If the senators would quarrel over the patronage, would it not have been bet ter to have required.them to call in the governor or the chief justice of the South Dakota supreme court to act with them as a committee of arbitra tion and award? These considerations are passed along to the president, to the authori ties of the district of Columbia and to the senate and- house committees on the district Li t us have an authori tative decision' as to whether it is law ful to dispose of federal patronage by lottery while similar disposal of less valuable property is forbidden and the law forbidding it is vigilantly enforced. I'orce of Demorralyr l'lim-iplcs. Mr. Bryan's drawing of the line be tween the points in which President Roosevelt has shown ome sort of re mote resemblance to a democrat and those in which he differs widely from a democrat only emphasizes the fact that the people or this country are true to time-honored democratic prin ciples. in order to keep tneir party in power, after it had been put m by Mark Hanna. both President McKin ley and President Roosevelt found it necessary to adopt a number of the cardinal policies of the democracy President McKinley led with his policy of obliterating civil war sectionalism, for which the democratic party had always contended. ' President Roosevelt saw at an early date that if the republican party did unt curb some of the great monopolies that had grown up under its fostering care, that task would be delegated to the democratic organization. That was as evident as anything iu Amer ican politics cquld be. But, with the exception that he has stolen a few bolts of democratic thun der. President Roosevelt is by nature and by habits of thought the most un democratic of all the 25 men who have served in the presidency. His rash and impetuous assumption of autocratic power far surpasses any thing that was charged in this line against the most harshly criticised of his predecessors. His contempt for tlie constitution his assaults upon the rights of the states and his novel doctrines of con stitutional interpretation would have been deemedJittle short of treasonable by any earlier generation. In all this there is not a- trace of the code of principles which make up the democratic creed. President Roosevelt has in him not a pinch of the leaven of democracy. He has shown himself only a clever opportunist who has taken up a democratic idea or two to serve his rad'oal republicanism.
