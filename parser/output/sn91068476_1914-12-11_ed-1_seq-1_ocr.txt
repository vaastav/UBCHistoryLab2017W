THUKE SOILS MADE HAPPY. Orange Tickers In Had Luck. ?i'axhaw Enterprise. Messrs. John Wilson and Erskine Robinson, who went to Florida a month of so ago to help pack oranges, made a home run last Thursday. The boys talk like there is no fun for foreigners just now in the Land of Flowers. Florida has a fine orange crop this year but the growers are not getting so many orders as usual. 1 ben too, boys from all over the coun try went to Florida this fall in search of winter quarters. Therefore, there are more boys than jobs In Florida this winter. Thu boys referred to tell some bewildering yarns of condi tions in the Peninsular. The orange pickers only get to work one or two days a week, have to do their own cooking and camp out. There Is no stock law In Florida and plney woods rattle and razorback hogs, in search quick and active and take advantage of the slightest opening to steal a bag of meal, a pot of soup or a ham sandwich. The pesky creatures sur round the camp on all sides, keeping one eye on the cook and the other on some toothsome morsel. The cook cannot leave to chase an intruder on one side without exposing the camp to an attack on the rear. There fore, the cook always has on the fire a pot of boiling water and when ever the enemy approaches near the ramp he is saluted with a skillet of hot water. A greeting of this kind generally causes some of the animals to be missing at the next engage ment. This Is right interesting lire and quite a number of Union county boys are enjoying it to the fullest, but John Wilson and Erk Robinson hare bad all they care for.

There are, Including Mr. Herrick, only 4 living people throughout the world have been thus decorated. 

TIIK CALM MIL WILSON. Says that We Shall .Not I-ose Our Self Possession, Which is the Surest Sign of Weakness, But Will Con tinue' a Nation Advocating Peace and Justice Even Though the Bal ance of the World is on t ire. President Wilson delivered his message at the opening of Congress Tuesday, and delivered a stunning blow to the Jingo sentiment which the thoughtless are now stirring up in this country . After saying that the subjects of business had been dealt with in a permanent way, he came to the subject of the national defense, and said: The other topic I shall take leave to mention goes deeper into the prin ciples of our National life and policy. It is the subject of our National de fenses, It can not be discussed without first answering some very searching ques- lions. It Is said In some quarters that we are not prepared. It is meant that we are not ready upon brief notice to put a Nation in the field, a Nation of men trained to arms. Of course we are not readv to do that; and we shall never be In time of peace so long as we retain our present political principles and institutions. And what is it that It suggested that we should be pre pared to do? To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means to do that, and shall find them whenever It is necessarv without calling our people away from their necessary tasks to render com pulsory military service in times of peace. Allow me to speak with great plainness and directness upon this great mater and to avow my ronivc tlons with deep earnestness. I have tried to know what America is, what her people think, what they are, what they most cherish and hold dear, hope that some of their finer pas sions are In my own heart some of the great conceptions and desires which gave birth to this government and which have made the voice of this people a voice of peace and hope and liberty among the peoples of the world and that, speaking my own thoughts I shall, at least in part. speak theirs also, however faintly and inadequately upon this vital matter. Xow hero Threatened. We are at peace with all the world. No one who spent; counsel based on fact or drawn from a just and can did interpretation of realities ran say that there is reason to fear that from any quarter our independence or the integrity of our territory Is threat ened. Dreiul of the power of any other Nation we are Incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the field of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own peaceful lives as we will but we also mean to live. We are, Indeed, a true friend to all the Na tions of the world, because we threat en none, covet none, desire the over throw of none. Our friendship can be accepted and Is accepted without reservation, because it is offered in a spirit and for a purpose which no one need ever question or suspect Therein lies our greatness. We are the champions of peace and of con cord. And we should be very Jeal ous of this distinction which we have sought to learn. Just now we should be particularly Jealous of it, because it is our earnest present hope that this character and reputation may presently, In Cod's providence, bring us an opportunity such as has seldom been vouchsafed any Nation, the opportunity to counsel and obtain peace in the world and reconciliation and a healing settlement of many a matter that has cooled and interrupt ed the friendship of Nations. This is the time above all others when we should wish and resolve to keep our strength by self-possession, our nfluenre by preserving our ancient principles of action. Xo Military Camps. From the first we have had a clear and settled policy with regard to military establishments. We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals, we shall never have, a large standing army. If asked, Are you ready to defend your selves? we reply, Most assuredly to the utmost; and yet we shall turn America not Into a military camp. We will not ask our young men to spend the best years of their life mak ing soldiers of themselves. There Is another sort of energy in us. It will know how to declare itself and make Itself effective should occasion arise. And especially when half the world Is on Are we shall be careful to make our moral insurance against the spread of the conflagration very de finite and certain and adequate indeed. More than this carries with It a re versal of the whole history and char acter of our policy. More than this, proposed at this time, permit me to say, would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession, that we had ! been thrown off our balance by But I turn away from the subject it is not new. There is no new need to discuss It. We shall not al ter our attitude toward it because some amongst us are nervous and excited. We shall easily and sens! bly agree upon a policy of denfense. The question has not changed its as pects because the times are not nor mal. Our policy will not be for an occasion. It will be conceived as permanent and settled thing, which we will pursue at all seasons, without haste and after a fashion perfectly consistent with the peace of the world, the abiding friendship of States, and the unhampered freedom of all with whom we deal. Let there be no misconception. The country has been misinformed. We have not been negligent of National de fense. We are not unmindful of the great responsibility resting upon us We shall learn and profit by the les son of every experience and every new circumstance; and what Is need ed will be adquately done. 

SAYS NAVY BHJ ENOUGH. One Officer Who Has Xot Been Ii- led By His Job. The ability of the American Navy to successfully meet the war fleet of any Nation except Great Britain was asserted Wednesday by Rear Admiral Fletcher, commander in chief of the Atlantic fleet, before the House Naval Affairs Committee. The possibility of conflict with Great Britain was so remote, said the Admiral, that he did not believe in a naval policy designed to control the oceans as against that country. Admiral Fletcher was under exami national! day by the committee at the first public hearing on a naval ap propriation bill held in many years He was plied with many questions about condition of the Navy, judged by lessons of the European war. Al though confidently declaring the Am erican Navy was over-matched only by that of England, he added that if this country continued to build only two battleships a year, Germany on the basis of her present construction program soon would be far in the lead. The Admiral said that all the ships of the Navy could be ready for war in a week. 

WILL KETUiX THE Fill!', United States Government Will Xot Permit Any Loiigei- Mexican l'ae Hons to Fire Across the Border. If the contending Mexican forces opposite Naco, Ariz., do not cease fir ing into American territory the three batteries of field artillery sent to the international line will be ordered to return the fire. This is the United States Govern ment's determination It became known yesterday after a full discus sion of the situation by President Wilson and his Cabinet. No specific orders have been given out, but while Brig. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss, who was directed to proceed to Naco with the field artillery is en route there, of ficials expect an answer to the sharp warning given to Mexican factions battling across the border that bul lets ana snens must not rail on American soil. No action of "aggression" is con templated, a statement issued by the White House said, but officials draw a distinction between aggressive and defensive action. For cavalry or ar tillery to cross the Mexican line would constitute an act of aggression, but to remain on American soil and re turn the fire of Mexicans, is in the opinion of high "officials, a measure of defense fully justified and not. an act of war or Invasion. ' Just As She Suspected. A woman, wearing an anxious ex pression, called at an Insurance of fice one morning: "I understand," she said, "that for five dollars I can Insure my house for one thousand dollars In your company? "And," continued the woman, anx iously, "do you make any Inquiries as to the origin of the fire?" "Certainly," was the prompt re ply: "we make the most careful in quiries, madam." "Oh," and she turned to leave the office "I thought there was a catch in It somewhere." war with which we have nothing to do, whose causes can not touch us, whose very existence affords us op portunities of friendship and disin terested service which should make s ashamed of any thought of hos tility or fearful preparation for trou ble. This Is assuredly the opportuni ty for which a people and a govern ment like ours were raised up, the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting concord which Is based on Justice aud fair and eenernns , dealing. Foresight. The lady who had charge of a certain village postofflce was strong ly suspected of tampering with par cels intrusted to her care. One day a rosk-cheeked youngster dressed in his best clothes entered the office and carefully laid a slice of cake on the counter. "With my sister, the bride's com pliments, and you will please eat as much as you can?" he saldl The postmistress smiled delighted ly. "How very kind of the bride to remember me," she cried. "Did she know of my fondness for wedding cake?" "She did," answered the youngster a . coldly, "and she thought she'd send you a bit of It this afternoon. Just to take the edge off your appetite be fore she posted boxes to her friends." Prolific and Ixing Lived. Wiixhaw Enterprise. Mr. W. R. Steele, vital statistician for this township, Informs The Enter prise that George Thompson, colored, who lives a few miles east of town, has eighteen children. George 1b 4 7 years old and his wife is 43. George's grandmother, who lives with the family. Is over 100 years old. She Is probably the oldest person in Un ion county. THE WAR. The news of this week which is causing much interest was the de struction of hte German squadron in the touth Atlantic last Tuesday Three cruisers were sunk In a battle which lasted for hours. Another one was sent to the bottom later, and the last or the five is believed to be bot tied up. The German Emperor is reported to have been confined to his bed for several days with an attack of bron chial trouble. The French and English cliam suc cesses in Western France as the Ger mans have withdrawn part of their forces to the east to fight the Rus slans. The Germans continue their efforts to smash the Russian armies. While a large part of their force is endeav oring to hold the Russian renter, an other army is advancing from East Prussia to the East of Mlawa and is attacking the Russian right in an ef fort to rut communications and enter Warsaw through the back door. Heavy fighting is going on south west of Lodz and southeast of Cra cow, where the Austrians and Ger mans are endeavoring to get around the Russian left and force these troops to retire from ihe fortress. The Germans are repeating on a large scale their favorite tactics of outflanking the opposing force. In this they always have gained initial successes because of their ability with better means to move their troops quickly. The Russians, however, heretofore have met them with over whelming numbers. The defeat of the Austrians bv the Servians is virtually admitted in the Austrian official report, which says that because they have met strong hostile forces Austrian troops have been ordered to occupy more fa vorable positions. This sudden turn of events in fa vor of the Servians is a mystery, but it Is possible they have received re iniorcements irom Kussia or more guns and ammunition from some friendly country; or it may be that some or the Austrian troops were withdrawn from Servia after the oc cupation of Helgrade. Whatever the cause, the Servian have Indicted severe defeat on the invaders. Something the Hard Ti s Should Tench. Written for The Journal. The hard times which all hear about ami many feel, should suflicl ently shock the nervous r.yhlem to cause individual and community sur veys of our status of thrift. It Is a gloomy winter prospect for many thousands thrown out of employment In addition to the poor lh.it are al ways with us, and the means of turn ishing sufficient relief Is a problem for every community. And while providing immediate relief the prob lem of permanent relief should re ceive due consideration. The spiiit and practice of philanthropy Is one of the finest fruits of "hristianliy ; but practical philanthropy, while in cluding immediate relief, looks to the permanent relief of the poor and unfortunate. It looks to the remov ing of the causes of dire poverty, to aid people to help themselves. The lesson of thrift efficient sav ing and the use of all available re souces of production does not en gage the serious attention of many people of the U. S. Wastefulness Is one of our chief characteristics Waste may be uneconomic production or expenditures, which comes from a poor valuation of things. ithout attempting now to discuss the matter at any length, just a few concret illustrations may prove stig gestive. An excuse for one boy's stop ping school for several days was that he might make some money to buy fireworks. The double and treblt waste of a boy over-aged for his grade stopping school to make money to buy fireworks phould be pufflcient- y suggestive without any comment. But this suggests the question, why buy fireworks at all? It would be bard to imagine many more inappro priate forms of celebrating Christmas than the explosion of fireworks. Christ came as the Trince of peace and not as god of war. Fireworks might be an appropriate form of cele brating the Fourth of July. And cer talnly with so much want staring us in the fare the waste of fireworks might be dispensed with for one Christmas. In addition to the matter of waste, there is a city law which forbids both the selling and the shoot- ng of fireworks in any part of the town by anyone. The matter of extravagent "ex change of Christmas presents" is another rase in point, of which every body seems to be tired. There Is suf ficient excuse this winter for a re form.
