WENATCHEE DAILY WORLD VOLUME I.—NO. 134. SEVERELY INJURED IN SALOON BRAWL E. S. Snyder Receives Bad Injuries In California Wine Room Last Night at the Hands of Pete Miller and Harry Brandon In the California wine room, the saloon which under the management of A. S. Barnes, earned the reparation of being the most disorderly place in We natchee, and wheie a few months igo Davd Su ilivan, a prominent rancher of Cashmere, met his death in a fight, last night occurred one of the most disgraceful brawls that has taken place iv this city for some time, aud result ed in the serious injury of E. S. Snyd er, a fruit tree salesman at the hands of Pete Miller, ex-bartender and re staurant man and Harry Brandon, a bartender. Snyder states that he was in the sa loon last evening and that while iie was standing at the bar Brandon and Miller began picking on au old nun who was sitting in the saloon minding bis own business. Snyder took the old man's part whereupon the two menjumpei onto him, knocked him down and kicked him in the face. No attempt was mad', to stop the men until they had so severely injured their victim that a doctor had to be called. The old man with whom Brand on and Miller were attempting to piok a quarrel is known to have had con siderable money with him and it is be lieved that it was the intention to rob him. No one seems to lie aide to explain why tiie two men were allowed to in jure Snyder so severely *btfore they weie stopped, the only explanat ion being that given by James Duniap, the bartender on duty at that time, who stated that Brandon and Miller were "frisnds of the house." Mr. Snyder this morning before City Attorney Parr swore out warrant for the arrest of Miller and Brandon but np to tbe time of going to press Mar shal Wheeler has been unable to locate either of them. It is believed that Brandon has left town. Duniap. the bartender, was the de fendant in a sensational rape ca c whioh was heard before Judge Steiner during the last term of court here. The case against him was dismissed after a hard fight. The California Wine room recently changed hands and the new owners seem fully abla to uphold the reputa tion of the house. The license of the saloon was recently renewed aganist the onposition of some of tbe council and the protests of many of the citi zens who presented a petition to the council asking that the pbce be clos ed. The license was granted only after Barnes had personally pledged himself that the saloon would be con ducted in an ordrely manner and in accordance with the city ordinances.

JEWISH MASSACRES EXTENSIVE LONDON. Dec. s.—according to official Jewish information, massacres of Jews occurred in 130 localities in Russia. WENATCHEE, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY DECEMBER 5. 1905 SALTED HIS MONEY IN NEW YORK STATE Defaulting Assay Office Cashier Adams Invests Some of the Stolen Gold in a Drug Store at Amsterdam. New York SEATTLE, Dec. s.—George Ed ward Adams, defaulting cashier of the assay office, has "salted" money away not only in this state but also back east. The j United States secret serv'ce men have discovered that the self confessed embezzler, since his peculations began at the assay office, purchased a half interest in a drug store at Amsterdam, N. Y. The newly discovered asset is valued at many hundreds of dollars. It is one of tbe finest stores in the town. A brother of Adams, holds the other half in terest. It is believed by the secret service officia's that Adams has many other interests in eastern cities. They are positive that with the proceeds of his assay office thefts he has embarked in enterprises in New York City under assumed names. The operatives in New York City are working on the case and they are tiie ones who discovered the Amster dam interest. G. E. Adams interest in the store will be attached by the government. Today Operative Conneli, Mr. Ker sfoot and Superintendent Leach, ot the San Francisco mint, devoted several iiours to making a thorough examination of the garage near the comer of Cherry street and Ninth ave nue, where the once popular clubman kept his automobile. They failed to discover any more gold or securities. They feel certain, though, that Adams secreted much more gold than has yet been found. The findiug of $10,000 in the coai bin Saturday night makes plain to the secret service men why Adams asked for a reduction of bail when arraigned before Commissioner Kiefer a few days ago. Adams asked that his bond be reduced to $15,000. With more than $10,000 in the cellar of his house, it would have been no particular trouble for him to raise the additional 000 and get out of jail. A great many people believe that Oper ative "Steve" Conneli discovered more than the amount announced, but neither he. Superintendent Leach nor Mr. Kersfoot will acknowledge that this is the case.

YOU MAKE THE TERMS Bousquet & Holm APOSTLE DOWIE NOW ON BRINK OF GRAVE John Alexander Dowie Feebly Enters the Pulpit and Sitting in a Chair Speaks to his People in a Faint and Trembling Voice. CHICAGO, Dec. n.— John Alexand er Dowie presented a pitiful spectacle of wanins'jihysical power .this after noon when he delivered his first ser mon since his return from Mexico, to the people of Zion City tahernacle. Sitting in a chair in the center of the hall and Bpeaking in tones that could soared' be heard twenty feet away, there vas shown a sharp contrast with the vigorous personality that former- 1 ly hurled doctrines in thunder tones to the uttermost parts of the big assmbly room. Dowie admitted that he was in no condition to appearand that he would not have attempted a sermon even in a sitting posture if he had not made a promise. He had spoken only a few worris when he became weak, tottered a trifle and felt his way, 'ike a fe6hle old man to his chair, bis voice trembl ing and uncertain A feeling of dread swept over the audience lest the "first apostle" be stnck4u again with paralysis, his tim/ before their eyes. With a great effort Dowie pulled himself together *wtd went on with his address saying ma feeble facetious way that if he did not the newspapers would give it out that be had died.
