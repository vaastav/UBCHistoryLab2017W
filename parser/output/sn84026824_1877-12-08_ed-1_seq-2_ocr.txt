It was one of the strongest Mud best bridges in tho vaUey of Vir ginia.

Ya., bince the destruction there by the late flood. The mayor and couneil have therefore issued a circular to the public . asking for donations, that a sullicient sum may be realized to enable the au- j thorities of that town to give immediate employment to the hundreds ot unem ployed, and by this means at once re- ; pair and render passable the thorough fares of the town, which were torn up and obstructed by the flood, and thus alleviate the widespread distress that prevails The circular states that the individual suffering which now prevails at Harper's Ferry, could it be given. J could uot fail to be heart-rending. Con tributions can be sent to Mr. George W. Green, mayor, and the smallest offVriug will be gratefully acknowledged. The people of the town are doing all iu their power, but there remains suffering that their efforts cannot reach. ?ST Folsi?. ? The body ot Mr. Chas.

C., \ pec, 5, 1377. f Half a generation ago when Wash i inuton ami its life were new to your correspondent, he passed every ay on one of the city's wide avenues a sturdy musician who upon a bright new ac cordion, played the martial airs then so popular. The player's object was gaiu and his vigorous and noisy music was hardly more constant than the fall lQto bis ample plate of the shining uicle and the rustling of bits of fractional curren cy. He was in the high tide of popu larity and suocess. As the years went by he kept his accustomed place, and regularity, but *ith gradually failing fiugers, gave us the old, old nju8ic Later, his instrument was cracked and discolored, his hands were weak and I trembling, and those who paused to lis i ten remained to pity but not to aumire, ' I passed him the ulher night at the same spot. The fragments of the aecordeon had dropped from his nerveless grasp, and lay before him; he was withered and shrunken; theie were no tokens ot i life about him save when his hands in voluntarily attempted, now aud then, in an aimless aud uncertain way, to make again the motions that had onoe given the listening crowds the notes of John Brown's Body," or his form BW""? weakly to and fro, A penny or two had been carelessly thrown into the once prosperous plate, as some citizen 1 had hastened his footsteps in passing i by. I thought, if this wreck of auother time could for a moment have aroused in his broken body the strength of earli er days, and have expended that d)ing energy iu attempting to repeat the music of the past, eucceedmg in bringing forth only noise aud homble discord, how like would that exhibition be to another even then to be seen in the Senate, where Conkling and KdmuncU in pitiful imitation of that which iiad been, were vainly striving to force What was left of Kepublicanism to produce the well kuown party music. The old musician in a little while will be buried in Potter's Field. The party of hatred aud violence? it is aiready dead. Tbe very fierceness of its late strucle has hasteued the "inevitable hour " As vou know the last important act of the Senate, at the Extra session was the admission of Sutler aud Ivel Wtr The proper Committee reported favorably on Eustis, but too late to se; cure his admission. The subject will come up early in the regular session, and Matthews, David Davis, 1 atteison, Turnover, and several others, besides Democrats, will vote to seat him. Theio is no doubt of the result. The message of Mr. Hayes is not a 1 that could be desired, but what ati ad vance it is upon late messages ! Ihere is not, from begiuuing to end that era phasizes section or centralism? in short, that speaks of Republicanism as now understood aud preached by its ^laiu s and Conklins. Its financial featuies will bo looked upon with favor or dis like, according to individual ideas of what is desirable, but this is not now and is not likely to be, a party It is not as decisive as one could wish in speaking of the Mexican question; it should have made adventurers and spec ulators understood at ouce that they coZlt force the country into war for thpir own aggrandizement. It moaesi ly ami nlost correctly any considerable success .or lis ."iter 3 civil service reform efforts. As to t Treasury, there are enormous abuses 1U its management, well known to Mr Haves, which are not alluded to. lne recommendations as to the Army an Navy follow pretty closely the ideas o the Secretaries. There is a good and well deserved word for this Distnct. Let us, whether he is really and right- . tully President or not, thank God that no worse man than Hayes occupies the I seat. i Of what will bo done by Congress in ' the early portiou of the regular session, i no one seems to be certain. Frobably | the holiday recess will be taken early and the consideration of important mat j ters be deferred until January. The Senate, if not the llouse, is in condition ' to enjoy rest. | The Daily Post will appear this week under excellent management, and pro | tnises to be, what we never have had 1 here, a Democratic paper at once lively and able.

PmldcBl1* SlcwMtfC?. j The firsl annual message of President ! Hayes is calculate J to produce a favoru I ble impression both at home and abroad, | as well from its general toue and spirit ' as from the soundness and good sense of its principal recommendations. It is entirely free from the tone ot sectional ism and partisanship whi^h has charac terized some recent messages to Con gress It is equally free trom anything like egotism, and eveu where the Presi dent alludes to the adverse criticism which has been passed upon his South* ern policy it is without a trace ot quer nlousneas or personal teeling. I his, too, is in marked contrast with the tone and temper of his immediate predecessor. Where the message touches upon mat ters which are already the subject ot consideration by Congress, such as the currency and the silver bill, it is with frankness and explicjtness, but without the slightest manifestation to dictate to Congress what policy it shall pursue. At the same time neither Congress or the country are left in doubt as to the I lesi dent's views upon any branch of the currency Question, or as to what his ac tion will be when called upon to parti cipate with Congress in the exercise of the legislative function. It is tolerably certain that nobill repudiating the solemu pledge ot tesumption heretoiore given, or for debasing the national currency by the introduction of asilver dollar at a nominal value in excess ot its commer cial value, with which to pay present national obligations, will ever receive the approval of President Hayes. The country will breath more freely fortius, i certainly, and American credit and American honor will stand higher abroad for the plain and emphatic lan guage of the message. The message begins naturally enough with a reference to the policy adopted by the President iu reference to affairs in the Southern States, and particularly to the excellent effect which have fol lowed irom the policy ot 11011 interfei euce and from the withdrawal of the troops. In these particular fruits of his policy the President finds his complete ( vindication. The discontinuance of the | use of the army, he says, tor the pur- , pose of upholding local government in two States of the Union was no loss a constitutional duty, under the circum stances, than it was necessary for the , local self-government and the promotion uf national harmony. The result has been that the fatal collisions between the races which for several years had been of frequent occurrence, have almost en tirely ceased, political turmoil and tur buleuoe have disappeared, useful indus tries have been resumed; public credit in the South has been greatly strength ened, and the benefits of a revival of commerce between the sections are moie fully enjoyed. Passing next to financial topics, the President, as already stated, declares himself emphatically in favor of the res toiation of the currency to its healthful and normal condition by the resumption ^ of specie payments. "Any wavering in , purpose or unsteadiness in methods, he I declares, "so far from avoiding or re ducing the inconvenience inseparable from the transition from an irredeema ble to redeemable paper currency, would only tend to increase and prolonged dis tu lbences in values, and unless retrieved must end in serious disorder, dishonor and disaster in the financial aflaiis ot the ? government and the people. hspecial- | ly, the President shows, will these mis chiefs be felt by the industrial classes. ?'The rich, the speculative, the money deaiii;" classes may not always feel the mischief of or may find casual profit in a variable currency, but the nnstoi tunes of such a currency to thosP who are paid salaries or wages are inevitable and rem- | ediless." Closely allied with this question of 1 specie resumption is that of readjust- | merit of our coinage system by remone- j ligation of the silver dollar, clothed by I legislation with the quality of a legal tender to a greater or less extent. This, i the Piesident reasons, would properly be a matter of legislative discretion and expediency solely, if it were notcompli- ! cated by considerations growing out of j the existence of the public debt and the ! obligations of national honor. "The i obligation of the public faith," says the ' President, "transcends all questions of , profit or public advantage otherwise." The bonds of the United States are held at home and abroad. All the bonds is sued since February 12, 1873, when gold became the only unlimited metalic legal-teuder, are justly payable in gold or its equivalent in value. Since that date the only dollar in coin that could be or was received by the government in exchange for bonds was the gold dollar. To require the holders of these bonds to accept in payment anv dollar ot less commercial value, would be justly re garded by them as a repudiation of part of the debt. The bonds issued before 1873 were issued at a time wheu the gold dollar was the only coin in circula tion or contemplated by either the gov ernment or the holders of the bouds as the coin in which they were t? be paid. The President further refers to the strict maintainauce of the public faith, iu en abling it to fuud the public debt at a lower rale ot interest. He therefore recommends that in any legislation pro viding for a silver coinage aud impart ing to it the quality of legal-teuder an exception be made in favcr of the pub lic debt heretofore issued and now out standing.and which shall not be paid, prin cipal or interest, in any coin af less com mercial value lhau the present gold coin of the country. Apart from these considerations of public faith, as affecting the public cred itor, the President expresses his utter distrust and disbelief in any commercial ease or relief to be obtaiued from the is sue of a silver coinage as unlimited le gal-tender. Uuless the two conditions are realized ? first, of a near approach to to equality of commercial value between the gold and silver coinage of the same denominations; and second, of a limita tion of the amounts for which silver is to be a legal-tender, the President does not believe that both can long be kept in circulation, but that the cheaper cur rency will inevitably drive ont the dear er. Without these conditions he "fears that only mischief and misfortune would flow from a coinage of silver dollars with the quality of unlimited legal-ten der, even in private transactions." All this, it is needless to say, is sound polit ical tjcouoruy, sound se use and souud morality. The whole country owes the President a debt of gratitude tor the manliness and clearness with which he I lias stated his views upon these import ant questions. The message next takes up the sub ' jeot of civil service reform. The Presi dent repeats somewhat vaguely and at length the sentiments expressed in his letter of acceptance upon this subject, and concludes by recommending a revi val of the commission appoiuted by his predecessor to digest rules lor the regu lation of the civil service of the coun try. The foreign relations of the United States preseut nothing of special inter est at Ibis time, not even in the case of Mexico. The President anticipates no trouble growing out of disturbances on the liio Grande, with au adequate mili tary force on our side of the river to prevent raids and punish outlaws xV brief summary is given of the re , port of the Secretary of the Treasury, and the secretary's recommendation that ' a tax of ten oeuts a pound on tea and two cents a pound on coffee should be imposed, iu lieu of a number of petty and annoying internal revenue taxes which yield a less amount of revenue, is concurred in. The service rendered by the army last summer, upou the application of the au- ' ! th or i ties of several Stales, in aid of the suppression of domestic riots and distur bances are brii Hy alluded to. The necessity for achauge in the ]>ol icy of the government iu the treatment of the lndiau is forcibly presented. The acknowledgment is franklv made that many, if uut most of our Indian wary, I have had their origiu in broken pledges and acts of injustice on the pait ot our own people and government, and the slow advance made by the Indians in civilization is largely, therefore, our own fault. The passage of a law admitting to the benefits of the homestead act and the privilege of citizenship Indians who may be willing to sever their tribal re lalions is recommended, as well a more j just and humane policy generally iu re gard to the Indians. The closing recommendation of the message is one whicn many persons who may approve of almost everything else the message contains will find most difficulty iu approving. The President urges upon Congress the policy and du- ? ty of legislating in aid of the States for the education of the whole people of the , country. There are mauy persons who i will not agree with the President in thinking that tho wisdom and nece. s ty of such legislation is no longer a (pus tion, but on the contrary, insist that it is a matter much better left to the States. ? Baltimore Sun. Tub Quern Eyed Moxstek. ? A dis patch from Cleveland, Ohio, says: Charles It. McGill, cabinet maker, twenty seven years old, killed his mis tress, Mary Kelly, this afternoon. Jeal ousy was the cause of the murder. He gave himself up. In a culm and per fectly cool manner he give the follow ing verbatim account of the shooting: k,I laid down on the bed with Mary, and after a tew words, I put my left arm around her, and with my right hand took the revolver from my pocket, and putting the muzzle to her ear, fired. She said: 'Forgive me, Charlie. Send for the priest.' I continued to shoot her iu the right cheek until the seven charges were emptied into her head. Finding she was (lead, I got up, sat on a chair, and put three more charges in the revolver, and laying her arm, which was across her breast, to one side, I put the muzzle as near Mary's heart as I knew how and fired two shots, and with the third load I shot her through the temple, making ten shots in all." After the above horrible recital Mc Gill ordered his supper, saying, '-Don't send me any cold lunch; 1 want a hot, square meal." The murderer was for merly from Athens, Ohio, and is said to have a wife and children in Columbus, Ohio. He has lived in Cleveland about a year and a halt. The Pago Courier says: ? "The situa tion of Mrs. Hisey and family during the recent freshet was one of the most dangerous and distressing that could be imagiued. She is an aflliottd lady, un able to move a limb except when assist ed, and is kept constantly in a ham mock. Her house on Dry Hun was surrounded by water six or eight feet deep, aud on the inside it was consid erably over the mantlepiece. The wa ter rose in the night, aud that so rapidly as to cut them off from all outside aid. They went to the garret and there re mained during the whole of the night in the most agonizing fear. The next morning as early as possible, when the water had subsided, they were relieved and taken to a neighbor's. The family consists of a mother, daughter and ft son. A Paper fob Young People. ?
