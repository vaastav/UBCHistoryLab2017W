A new company is to be organized to take over the well-known Alaska-Ebner company's holdings, with ample capital lo do a mining business on a large scale. In view of the work tiiat has been already accomplished in the way of developing i hose holdings and the progress made toward effecting a re-or ganization, there is ample reason to believe that before the be ginning of spring another financially strong and well equipped mining company will have invaded the Juneau gold belt. The Juneau gold belt is commanding pre-eminent attention. The different mining periodicals of the Pacific slope and the East are filled these days with articles concerning the develop ments here and in other sections of Southeastern Alaska. All these articles are commendatory and they speak in the most con fident terms of the mining and business future of this region, as well as that to the Westward. It is the belief of many mining men that this section of Alaska will, within a short time, be a strong competitor of the Rand in gold production from quartz mining. And the developments thus far made, coupled with those that are promised, seem to warrant this conclusion. PUSHING THE RAILROAD BILL. CHAIRMAN HOUSTON, of the House Committee on Territor ies, is anxious to have the Alaska railroad bill passed as speedily as possible so that the President may begin to car ry out its provisions early next spring. This is good news, in deed, as it may be taken to reflect the views of the House major ity a> to the necessity for the early passage of the railroad meas ure. President Woddrow Wilson in his recent message put the Alaska question squarely up to the Congress, and as his party has a clear majority in both branches action is going to be had. But the railroad bill and the solution of other Alaska questions will receive support from Republican members of Congress, and especially those from the Western States, many of whom are quite well informed as to conditions in Alaska and the need of prompt action. In this connection it may be noted that Delegate Wicker sham has introduced a bill in the House providing for the re peal of the one hundred dollars a mile tax now levied on rail roads in Alaska, and the substitution instead of a four per cent, tax per annum on the net earnings of the railroads. This is a step in the right direction. The tax on railroad mileage in Alas ka has had the effect of closing down railroads which might have been operated a part of the year at least, thus affording transpor tation facilities to miners and prospectors. The tax has long been considered unjust by most Alaskans who are familiar with its operation.
