He is understood to he willing that a bill should be passed authorizing the re vival of the grade of vice admiral for the benefit of Rear Admirals Sampson and Schley, tne former to be given seniority of the other. It is believed Secretary Long will join in indorsing this solution of the controversy. What will probably cause considerable criticism among Rear Admiral öchley's friends is the determination of Secretary Long to name Admiral Sampson in the measure he is preparing, . giving the thanks of congress to the couunander-in chief of the-north Atlantic squadron and the officers and men under his command, It is not believed, however, that the president will transmit such a resolution to congress, knowing what determined op position it will meet and the probability that friends of Schley would have his name substituted for that of Sampson and paaa the resolution in that form.
