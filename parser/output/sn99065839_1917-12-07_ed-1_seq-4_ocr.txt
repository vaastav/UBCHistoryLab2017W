Reports received by wholesalers and jobbers from retailers and small jobbers throughout the country indi cate that underwear stocks are rapid ly being depleted. Union suits for both men and women are said to be more plentiful than separate shirts and drawers.

Thompson at HeacT of Committee Revision of Train Schedules is Likely. Western Newspaper Union News Service. Washington. In the minds of Vice Presidents of Eastern lines, who met hare to work out a contemplated pool ing of facilities to relieve congested traffic, government ownership of American railroads during the war is a probability that appears nearer each day. Unless the system about to be undertaken by the roads themselves succeeds from the beginning, it is con ceded by the officials that Uncle Sam must step in and assume control, whol ly directing operations. The Vicfr Presidents, with members of the Rail road War Board, worked on details for a pooling of as much of the track age and equipment as is considered practicable. They named a committee to be put in charge of the pool, with A. W. Thompson, Vice President of the Baltimore and Ohio, as chairman. Other members are C. R. Gray, President of the Western Maryland; A. T. Dice, President of the Philadel phia and Reading; P. E. Crowley, Vice President of the New York Central; Elisha Lee, acting Vice President of the Pennsylvania Lines East; G. L Peck, Vice President of the Pennsyl vania Lines West, and A. J. Stone, Vice President of the Erie. The com mittee will establish headquarters in Pittsburg and will sit continuously until the present congestion is cleared. Its first meeting will be held there Wednesday. The pooling plan calls for a joint use of tracks, locomotives, cars and em ployes in the congested centers. It will not be permitted to go so far, even the railroad heads admit, as to threat en the revenues of any lines, and thia is the point advocates of government operation emphasize as illustrating: the . need for government operation. Under government supervision the roads could pool their profits, whichi under present circumstances would constitute a violation of the anti-trust act To Remove Germans From Lake Front Chicago Initial steps looking to the ousting of Germans from barred zones, as indicated by President - Wilson'a proclamation, were taken by United States Marshal John J.
