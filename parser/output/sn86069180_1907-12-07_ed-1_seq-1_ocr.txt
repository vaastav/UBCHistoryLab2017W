ACTION POSTPONED At a meeting ot the directors of the Catholic Womans Club held Monday afternoon It was decided to postpone the purchase of a new club house until a later date The WestI I Walnut street is only leased and the I lease expires February 1 The build ing is part of the Caldwell estate d I and the heirs propose to erect a new and modern building on the site as soon as the club house is vacated While Desirous of seeking new and I permanent quarters the directors of the Catholic Womans Club deemed it advisable to wait until the string g enof in the money market is over it 1h 1 c WANTS UNION I Able Dundallc Editor Asks the Irish Nationalists to Behave I Declares That Homo of the Members Are Too Ambitious AU Must Work Together If CauHo Is to Be Promoted HIS WARNING WORTH REEDING I That there is discord in the ranks if the Irish National party in this British Parliament is evidenced by the following article in a recent Issue of the Dundalk Democrat The able editor does not mince words in asking the Nationalist members to got together The article in point is as followsUnfortunately the national cause Is in a bad way The built of the people seem to have lost heart Hope long deferred has sickened them The council bill fiasco has driven many of them to despair of Parliamentary action Discord and disaffection arc leating s of the nation and no man is without an excuse for the apathy and fac tion which < prevail where once en thusiasm and determination marched hand In hand There is sickness in the body politic The evil commenc Ing at the head has made its way to trunk and members and there are not wanting prophets to forecast an early Nationalist dissolution It Is this state of things that calls for the earnest intervention of every genuine Nationalist The fair weather politician who goes with the crowd and pays easy obedience to majority rule will be of no assistance In this emergency But the man who believes in the national future of Ireland will not be willing to stand idly by nnd see the move ment built up by Parnell collapse utterly And it is the men of courage and determination that are wanted now It is on their outspoken demand for unity nnd concerted action amongst all the wouldbe leaders and all the sections of professing Nationalists that the real hope for the immediate future of Ireland restsWe We have at present a multiplicity of advisers We have no lack of self elected guides each of whom is pre freedom pared to point the way to frecdom We have a certain number more or less of disciples ready to follow each We think that It will be admitted that the vast bulk of the people adhere to the Parliamentary move ment as represented toy the United Irish League and the party led by John Redmond What is really want ing is the enthusiasm that makes a political movement virile and ef fective silences the carper and the faultfinder and draws the uncertain ivaverer into the floodtide of popular progress There is nothing in the political situation that Is beyond repair The present differences might be com posed and the national forces united If wisdom and toleration and disin terested patriotism were called to aid The men with axes to grind and the men who will not serve and the men whose ambition overleaps their patriotism are after all an in considerable few We fear there nro some of them In more than one party at the present time The masses of the people have it in their power to right things if they but undertake the task There may be rotten branches in the political tree There may be corruption and selfish ambition here and there But the people can purge these things anil they ought to lose no time about it The question is how to set about this One thing is sure and that is thut it will not be done by standing aside and watching a party wrangle There is a national organization which affords scope for the political activities of all There is machinery within that organization for making it the mouthpiece of the peoples will Whatever abuses may have grown up in connection with it whatever faults there may be in ltd operations they can exist only a l1 long as1 the people tolerate them If the national policy is in need of amendment the League affords the machinery to set about amending it It Is from within that the reconstruc tion should come The reformer who assails from without destroys what ho seeks to amend I If we are to achieve anything for our country it is not by quarreling among ourselves The fanatic be hei i of the majority or any of the minor Itieswho will not tolerate the perI sonality or the unorthodoxlty of view of his neighbor whose ultimate political alms are his own is the thePro worst enemy of Ireland The pro teasing home ruler who will not proI hands with his brother Nationalist who entertains some mere or less harmless fad in politics is n lesMI I seeker or a sham It is not for Ire land he Is working but for the triumph of himself or his own peculiar ism But the vast majority of the Irish people will we hope labor earnestly to advance the na tional cause by any and every means with the aid of any aria every helper I The county demonstrations in support of home rule affords a platform broad enough for all of us

EMPLOYERS LIABILITY ACT President Roosevelts message to ho Sixtieth Congress like everything else that comes from his pen is an IbUs document While it treats of n variety of subjects it deals prin cipally with commercial and indus trial conditions lie commends the movement for an eight hour day and insists upon the extension of the employers liability act and declares that labor unions as well as combina tions of capital have come to stay lie alff calls attention to the ap palling loss ol life l in railroad acci dents and recommends government supervision or inspection just as steamboats are subjected to super vision The entire message is well worth You can not expect to master it all in n day or oa be carefully read by every thinking person inlhe wiiitcd States President Roosevelt urges Congress to limit the abuse of injunctions and declares that employers frequently rush to the courts to protect them selves from labor unions when re course to the courts Is not necessary While his views on the liability of the employer will meet with the approval of the workingmen It is doubtful if railroad companies nnd employers generally will indorse the following The National Government should be a model employer It should de mand the highest quality of service from each of its employes and it should care for all of them properly In return Congress should adopt leg islation providing limited but definite compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope of the Federal power Including employes of navy yards and arsenals In other words a model employers liability act farreaching and thoroughgoing should be enacted which would apply to all positions public and private over whlc the National Government has 1 risdictipn jThc jiiniiber ot accidents to wage vorleers including those that are preventable ana those that are not has become appalling in the mchanical manufacturing and transportation operations of the day It wdrks grim hardship to the ordinary wageworker and his family to have the effect of such an acci dent fall solely upon mm and on the other hand there are whole classes of attorneys who exist only by inciting men who may not have been wronged to undertake suits for negligenceAs As a matter of fact a suit for negligence Is generally an inadequate remedy for the person injured while it I often causes altogether dispro portionate annoyance to the em ployer The law should be made such that the payment for accidents by the employer would be automatic Instead of being a matter of lawsuits Workmen should receive certain and definite compensation for all acci dents in industry irrespective of negligence The employer is the agent of the public and on his own responsibility and for his own profit he serves the public When he starts in motion agencies which create risks for others he should take all the ordinary and extra ordinary risks involved and the risk he thus at the moment assumes will ultimately be assumed as it ought to be by the general public Only In this way can the shock of the acci dent lc diffused instead 61 falling upon the man or woman least able to boar it as Is now the case The community at large should share the burdens as well as the benefits of Industry By the proposed law em ployers would gain a desirable cer tainty of obligation hind get rid of litigation to determi it while the workman and his fflmily would be relieved from a crus ling load With such a policy would come Increased care and accidents would be reduced In number The national laws pro viding for employers liability on rail roads engaged in Interstate corn coerce and for safety appliances as well as for diminishing the hours any employe of a railroad should be permitted to work should all he strengthened wherever in actual practice they have shown weakness they should be kept on the statute books in thoroughgoing form That kind of talk has the right ring and shows that the chief of the nation has the welfare of the work ing n mn at heart On the eight hour day the President says The Congress should consider the extension of the eight hour law The constitutionality of the present law has recently been called into ques tion and the Supreme Court has de cided that the existing legislation in unquestionably within the powers of Congress The principle of the eight hour day should as rapidly and as far an practicable be extended to the entire work carried on by the Gov ernment nnd the present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public works which the present wording of the act has been con strued to exclude The general intro duction of the eighthour day should bo the goal toward which we should steadily tend and the Government should set the example in this respectAnd read this and bear it in mind Modern industrial conditions are such ihat combination + i ia not only necessary but inevitable It is so in the world of business just as it is so in the world of labor and it is as idle to desire to put an end to all corporations to all big combinations of capital as to desire to put an end Corporation tion and labor union alike have come to stay Each If properly managed is a source of good and not evil This is what workingmen have contended all along and the fact that President Roosevelt indorses the right of workingmen as well as capitalists to unite is a just victory for the breadwinners of the nation

attended Not only were the people of the pariah devout in their attendance but the faithful from all parts of ihe city made dally visits to the church churchA t I ELEVATION Is Probably In Store For the Republican Governor of Kentucky Friends Hope to See Him on the Supreme Bench at Early Date Reasons Urged Why They Are Not Making Mistakes in Premises MEATS HONOR AND DIGHIH Gus Willson for the Supreme bench Is the slogan of the friends of Kentuckys Governorelect Why not Whats to prevent It they inquire They reason well too Gor Will son was a former law partner of Justice John Harlan who has graced the Supreme Court of the United States the most august judicial judlclolbody thirty years Judge Harlan is seventyeight years old Not too old to work he says but there Is an impression that he will retire when he is assured that the man of his choice will be appointed to succeed him Where and how and under what circumstances could ho find a worthier successor than Augustus E Willson Trained in the law under his own tutelage following his pre cepts as to personal conduct Wlllson is the man above all others that Justice JIarlan would choose as his successor and irrespective of politics a mantle never fell on worthier shoulders The Kentuckians a society of our exiled brethren now sojourning in New York City will give a banquet at the Hotel Plaza there on Decem ber 23 in honor of Justice Unrlan This organization is made up of the most distinguished sons of thei i State who have sought larger fields of action in time great metropolis Men like John G Carlisle William Lindsay and James Lane Allen are at its head The banquet promises to be an intellectual as well as a gastronomical treat To cap the climax would it not be nice for Justice Harlan to announce his re tirement and the fact that President Roosevelt had elevated Kentuckys Governor to the Supreme Bench in his stead l Stranger things havo lappened Surely none could object to the elevation of Gov Willson A man of integrity lie lias been ele vated to the highest office in the State by popular vote Not only was he elected by a majority of more than 18000 but his election caused a slump of 41000 in the opposition party The elevation of Coy Willson would mean much to Kentucky Our State hns earned a position of dignity in the Union Justice Harlan haV betn one of the most astute Judge on the bench of the Supreme Court Why then should he not bo allowed the privilege of suggesting his suc cessor Tills is the way that Gov Willsons friends argue and they argue well Moreover it must be taken into consideration that Gov Willson although comfortably well fixed is not a rich man as the world goes Four years in the Gubernatorial chair means a loss of four years in his practice Elevation to the Supreme Bench of the United States means years of dignity and a salary commensurate with his tastes Even though his wishes were not consulted he would hardly refuse the promo tion if it were tendered him Mr Willson went to Washington shortly after his election and was wined and dined leave out the wine please he does not drink by the celebrities o the nations capital Jn eluding President Roosevelt and Ju ice Harlan He had no favors to ask When the President asked him to put his finger Into the distribution of Federal pie Sir Willson said saidITake ITake it away President Roosevelt admires a man that attends to his own business and Mr Willson8 refusal to take part in the distribu tion of Federal patronage in thf State made a hit with him All lj I all his chances for elevation to time Supreme Bench are about the best that ever happened
