This bellef he bases on a con? ference he had yesterday with Speaker Joseph <j. Cannon and a session to-day ? wlth the Bcpubllcan members of the I | Waya and Meana Committeo of the' Houso of Repreaentfctlvea. Mr. Taft said he had not as yot conaulted wlth members of tho Senate on thu subject, ! lndlcatiug at the same tlme the tre , mendous presaure upon hla tlme slncc : he had been in Washlngton. When the suggestion was made that i the .Senate wouhl undoubtedly have : somethlng to do wlth the tariff bill i.-'fter the Houao had paased lt, he re ; plled, with no uncertalnty ln hls de ? meanor, that there was also somo one olsc who also could havo somethlng to ) do wlth the bill, whlch, lntorpreted ! through the rnedlum of previous utlfcr ? ances, Iridlcaies clearly that Mr. Taft 1 iy determlned, even to tho exerclse of I the veto power, to proaecute tho ! pledges of the party. Mr. Taft dlctated b statement whlch eovered hls Inter? view late to-day with tho Kepublican members of the committeo, wlth th-j exceptlon^C Bc-prcsentatlves McCall, of MaaaachinTetta, and Ciumpacker, of In dlaua.

Tho questlon of the spcakership of the next Congreas, Mr. Taft said. wav not dlacuased. but many other matters of legislatlon were. or whlch ho pre ferred not to give detaila at this tlme, He added that lie had been somewhat mlsled regarding his Interpretation of the attltude of the Speaker by the preas reports of Mr. Cannon's epeech in No vember before the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce. The offlclal report of that speeoh. he sald, had glven hlm an entirely dlfferent iinpression. Taft's Statement. Mr. Taffs statement follows: "I had an interview with Mr. Cannon veaterday. and with his concurrence and at the suggestion of a member of the Waya and Meana Committeo, with the Bepublican members of that com? mitteo this af ternoon. and from my conversation with them and the dls , cussion whlch followed as to the exam fiination whlch they are now conduct ing and cxpect to conduct. I have every rcason to be confldent that they aro keenly allve to the obligation whlch is on them as representa.tlves elected to represent the Republlcan party to prc paro an honest and thorOugh revlslon of the present tariff; that they have taken as much tlme and as much evl dence aB has been taken In the prepa ratlon of other tarfffs, and that they ? aro going to make addltlonal and Inde ?-l pendent efforts to get at the ovldenco d| themsolvos by the uso of subpoenaa and e under oath, with a vlew to reachtng tho "! ilifferenee in the continued cost of pro 8 ductlon or the various artlcles here ri and abroad. ,1 "I found them quite anxious for a& r much harmony aa posslble, ln whlch I sympathlaed wlth them and preparea for consultatlon on polnts of dlffloulty that mlght arlsc at any tlme ln the future. "The plan la to prepare a bill on such ovldenco ns they havo and wlll havo in tho course of tho hearlngs, and thor. to call addltlonal ovldenco as to the Itema whenever lt ahould seem necesaary, Not only from conversa? tion wlth the members togethor. but wlth the membera indivldually. t am quite. convlnced that they aro ln good falth going to prepai'o a bill whlch shall be a thorough revlslon on the basls of tho platform of the Bepubli? can party. "The dlscusslon covored othor thlngs, like the Phillpplne tariff, and I am vory hopeful thnt thero wlll bo no dlffloulty ln reachlng an agreeraerit betweon the varloua lnduatrlea Inter ested ln thom?those repreaentlng the Phlllpplno Islands and thoso represent ing tho sugar and thu tobacco intercsts ?so that there wlll be no diaputo, and that tho matter may bo Indorpbrated in the new tnrlff bill without an issue."

Governor Deneen had pre sented a copy of rosolutlons adopted by the associatlon, and made a few remarks, to whlch thc President rc plled as follows: "I havo felt as the Governor has welt put It, that no moro important nervlco could he rendered to this country than tlio bullding of tlie Panama Canal be? tween tho Atlnntic and tho Paciflc; and one thing I am proud of In con nectlon wlth the bullding of that canal is that there hns not been legitimate* cause for the breath of scandal con? nected wlth any featuro of the pro-. ceedings.
