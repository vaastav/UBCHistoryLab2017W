Fair samples of whangdoodleism are not usually abundant, and when, therefore, we meet with, them we in variably desire that our readers may enjoy tLecu The-following from the Courier of yesterday! h a splendid specimen aa improvement, if any thin?, on its "'Sunday Law" edi-toriala'-lt is designed to make party capital out of President Geant's Mes- sage. Thus the Courier: But Mr. Grant now tells ua that foreigners who become citizens of the United Siates, but who go abroad in the interest or trade and commerce, and who become domiciled for a term of years upon foreign Boil, must not ftrnect the protection of the Amen can flag in their foreign homes. They must be looked upon as adventurers, claim: nz the protection ol this Uov ernrsent, but contributing nothing to its revenues, because they; dwell in other lands. They, must bo re farmed as cheat3 and imnosters. de inandinir Protection, but avoiding the support of the Government. So says Mr. Grant! ' American citizens native and to the manor born," may go abroad and invest their means in speculation. Let the hand of-tyranny tall upon their shoulders, and the power of their native government 'is stretched forth lor their protection. But because a m citizen was unfortunate enough to be born abroad, he must be abandoned in the hour of his trial because he had cot been fortunate enough in his new home to accumulate wealth that would afford him protection and com fort ! , - : Will the people of the United State a sustain such an outrageous dogma f Is our Government to fail of its support of naturalized American citi zens when traveling or doing business 1 abroad I . Is tho new doctrine of Mr. Grant to supplant the longestablishcd policy or the American republic f , , There are other -matters connected with the message equally monstrous We shall call the attention of the peop!o to them. We Ehall expose the approach to Imperialism in our teems war, as best we can. The message of Mr. Grant is full of the most glaring recommendations of wrong, and contains but little that is right and commendable. It3 foreign policy is its most terrible feature, and - its domestic recommendations, in ' their mildest sense, are intolerable to a people who have been free and seek the continuanco of freedom. Turning to the President's Message, we find the following paragraph to be the cause cf the Courier's indignation : The unsettled political condition of countricss less fortunate than our own sometimes indueos their citizens to come to the United .States for the sole-purpose of becoming nat uralized. Having secured this, they return to their native country and re side there without disclosing their change of allegiance. They occupy official positions, or positions of trust or honor, whiGh can only be held by citizens of their . native land; they travel under " passports describing them as such citizens, and it is only when civil discord, after, perhaps, year3 of quiet, threatens their per sons or their property, or when their native State drafts them into its mili tary service, that the fact of their change of allegiance is made known. They reside, permanently out of the United States. They contribute noth ing to .its revenues; they avoid the duties of its citizenship, and they only make themselves known by a claim of protection I have directed Diplo matic and Consular omcera of t United States to scrutinize carefully all such claims of protection. The citizen of the United States, whether .1 natives or adopted, who discharges his duty to hi3 country, is entitled to its complete protection. While I have a " voice in the direction of affairs,. I shall not consent to injure the sacred " right by conferring it upoa fictitious or fraudulent claimants. -. So the Courier would have the Gov erhmeht of the United confer all the ; benefits of citizenship upon men who permanently reside in foreign lands, holding positions of honor and trust ,? which they could not hold were their American citizenship known, and who draw their naturalization papers only when their, native States draft them into military service. They avoid all tho dutie3 of citizenship, and only make themselves known by a claim of , I protection. They are to all intents ; and purposes fictitious or fraudulent claimants, and arc not entitled to the protection of the Government. We honor the President for his manly re pudiation of these bogU3 American I citizens. Citizenship imposes duties as well as confers privileges. Those who refuse to discharge the duties, are not entitled to the privileges. Tns Missouri Democrat closes an article onlhe IUchardson-McFariand difficulty, ia . JSW 'York, with, the following paragraph, which has in it much that is worth remembering: As a rule, it may to said thart a husband and wife luxve once lived happily together, there can never be a separation without misconduct by three persons, the husband, the wife and somebody else. The husband who never neglects his wife will not, as a rule, ever have to buy a pistol to snoot her . seducer. The wife who never fails ia her duty to her husband, Hi;-0 a3 a rulo hav5 seek pro-ft- um BOme other man. And !n,n ? De-?cr interferes between husband and wile, who never makes himself to the wife a nearer friend than her husband, who never seeks herlovo on the one hand draws too near if she invites, on the other, will never as a rule get shot by an 'infuriated husband." There mav be exceptions to these rules. But there are not many. And we think a study of them likely to bo more beneficial than Mr. Prothingbam's prayer or Mr. Bcecher's remarks at the funeral. , .

Mnsic Teaching Suggestions. Tn this letter I will 'depart, in ropaarire. from the subiect which the heading suggests, a3I wish to speak tlv hear it stated or surmised hv scientific men (or those wno ouht to be) tnat singing is an idju ry, that it has injured this person or thnt nPTson. and thereby convey the r - , . - . ,i. impression tnat tins exercise upua iue vocal organs and lungs has brought on a disease ct tnose organs, ana finallv eonsumotion. or that it has hopn the nrinciDal agency or cause dnn neh assertion by a Derson who is supposed to be scientific and who is generally wen miormeo, wn very naturally exert a wide spread influence, especially over those (and tho class is laree) who very seldom, if ever, reflect or reason irom causs to effect." What 13 tne result t it is this : " Why do you let your daughter take lessons in singing f Why do voa let her 6inz -so much? Don you know that she will have the con- - aA . Ml t Mil' sumntion. ll vou co tnat it will kui i The-ocly or most fitting reply to such a stupid thought would be, ".Non sense ' And yet this would not De areument. To those who think or are well informed, it seems almost m credible that any argument or discus iirm is necessary to dissipate the mind of such a cross error, lie Hcrt fnr iiist & moment that tb suggestion is not in regara to mm but to "her." I have never-heard this reason given why boys should not study vocal culture and practice sing ing. Why so? Is.it because boys, or young men, never devote or give attention to this valuable and inter esting study? or, as Bassini says, be cause the organism of woman is bo different from that of man that she cannot exercise tho lungs and chest as men do during the act of respiration. No one believes the former, (not even in this city) and every physician" or common sense person, will ridicule the idea as being very absurd. -The reason if there is aDy why ladies (women, I should say) cannot exercise the chgst and lungs properly andpAy siologically, whether during the act of singing or not, is evident. , It need not ; be stated . here. ; My pupils, whether private or class, understand me upon this point, and if they fail to give heed to the plainly spoken sug gestions and. advice, it is cither be cause they are not fully convinced of tho benefits to bo derived from put ting the suggestions injo practice every day or they lack physical en ergy and mental force to make the requisite effort. This latter is too often the reason, I fear In ninc tenths of the cases, where any lDjury results from vocal practice, it is be cause the proper. organs or muscles 7ie motive' potcfr are not brought into exercise. This mode of practice is just about as absurd as to attempt to lift a heavy weight with the arm by simply exercising the muscles of the arm or leg. Men are at fault in this respect, the same as women, though not to the same degree. I will here remark that this igno rance of the laws of health ought to be corrected in our common schools and colleges, and I venture to say that in the majority cf schools where Physiology" is recognized as an im portant branch of study and instruc tion is actually given but very little, if anything, is said in regard Jto the coirect method of breathing. And if the Bubject is hinted at, it is not made practical. Not one professional elo cutionist in ten does justice to his class in this particular. Tho " Min ister's sore throat " is the natural re sult of ignorance. But to finish what I havo to say upon this subject would mrVe it too long. More anon. II. S. Perkins. Midsummer Mght's Dream in Boston. Marie Twain's Cor. EalTalo Express. Boston has ; resurrected "Midsum mer Night's Dream," and doing it after a more splendid fashion than has ever beea attempted with a Shakesperian play in America before. In consequence, Selwyn's thoatre is likely to be crowded for many a com ing night. , Some of the scenery in this new wonder ia marvelous. In one part of the play the curtain rises upon a spcctacl-j something like this: In the foreground a lake as smooth and as glassy as a mirror; about its borders a luxurious growth of trop ical plants; in tha center a very small island, with one or two stately trees on, it whoso roots are hidden among blossoming plants and both trees and plants are faithfully mirrored in the lake; beyond are two or three simikr islands, one behind another, and each glassia,; itself in the water the outlines of the trees and reflec tions growing fainter and fainter in the'.receding distance; in the far back ground the lake narrows to a winding river, which, is soon lost among tow ering mountains. A11 this in a rich, dreamy sort of twilight. .i Presently a mellow radiance -begins to m suffuse the sky behind , the mountains; it grow?, brightens, and a silver edge of the moon peeps above a distant crag; in a few mo ments the entire moon appears, casts an amber glory over trees, islands, lake and river drifts behind a cloud appears again is lost behind a orag, but marks it3 course with a silver edge as it moves along then comes out full in tho heavens again, and straightway its wrinkled and glitter ing reflection ' comes shimmering across tho water, just as you have seen a catspaw of wind mark its ap proach on a river. It is enchant ingly beautiful. Nature herself could not spirit away a twilight more deftly and replace it -with the tender luster of the moon more hapDily. Presently tho Ecene "become a pano rama. The islands go drifting away out of eight, the lake crows broader and broader, till its burnished surface stretches away into an enchanted distance; and now its perfect natural ness is made still more noticeable as curves and "shreds of Eeawced and other trifles floating on it3 surface drift into the quivering track of the moon and are instantly lit up with a bright sheen and then drift out gam and take the dull hue they had before. Directly, right in tho fore- round, a small island glides into iew with a venerable rum en jt Uvo . Ml cr six grim, monstrous pilars, vt a massive capstones, ana aoout ineu. bases the fallen entablatures, wreatr- ed with ivy. Imagino tho picture of the guttering sea around about tms oneJy old temple on its paten ot island, and the yellow disk of tne moon appeariDg and disappearing as it shows between the black columns one moment, sliding their fluting3, and hides behind an intervening on the next. The temple elides away, and we ose it and regret it. But shortly tho placid sea begins to assume a chilly ook, and in another moment a vast iceberg, undermined with huge arches, comes into view then a brilliant group of such. An arch of blinding lght (Lne aurora boreaiis), lalls upon thc.ECJne, and whatsoever wander3 into it flitting fanes, swimming water-spirits, swans, doomed and pinnacled -icebergs are glormed ror that moment, as n tee iigninins clothed them. The elouda in the sky are filled with all manner of fantas tic little devila and such things, and presently among these clouds appears a great, round, dimly defined disk; with two female figares in it, royally attired, but with such a soft, exquis ite film about them' that they eeem unreal,- intangible,; spiritualized an illusion, a dream, a vision, almost a part of the cloudy surroundings.
