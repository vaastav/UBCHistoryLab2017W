It A I l.ltOAl) BGIIiDIKU. On Paper ami Ollier wise. There arc three distinct railroad projects now being eai ncsilv considered by the people of ih is comity two of which Imvc the appear ance of being in accord, with the third utter ly ignored by both, and yet Ihc third covers the section of country lying between these two. We refer to the Enimitslmrg movement 1 fora road to Gettysburg and (he Middletown Valley movement, as the two on the face of . a flairs as being in nenird, and the M. V. & F. It. If. (extension Of the M. V ) as the third movement ignored hy the oilier two. Now, it is our purpose, in this article, to < amplify a statement made in these columns several weeks ago, and prove, beyond cavil, that the proposed route from Middletown to Gettysburg, via Rocky Ridge and Emmits- I burg, as compared with that one via Ca'.otliu Furnaces, Meehanicstown and Einmilshurg * is wliolly impracticable, viewed either from Ihe standpoint of cost of construction or from that of paying traffle when completed. First: the Rocky Ridge route will he the longer of the two ; again, a survey lias been made by the former route and this need only he compared with any possible route via ‘ Rocky Ridge to show that in the matter of 1 bridges and approaches to the three streams, 1 Fishing Creek, Hunting Creek and Owens 1 Creek, alone, the lower route is nnpractica- 1 hie. These stieams on any line reaching 1 Rocky Ridge arc hounded on one or both sides by immense ridges of red ro k, the - valleys great depressions and the interlying spaces irregular summits every one of under lying red rock to any depth necessary to go i to secure the grade; to bridge and approach ; i the three streams alone, by the lower route, 1 i would, in the judgment ol one conversant j wilh both routes and informed in matters of ■ this kind, more than build the road lied 1 from Catoelin Furnaces to Yellow hirings. A glance at the map ot any geodetic survey will convince any one of Hie evenness of the ! lines of equal altitude at the immediate base j of i he Ca loci in Spur and every one acquaint cd with the section knows how wonderfully I broken and displaced is the entire red rock j strata. In the matter of road lied construe- j tmii and bridges, the lower route by eompar- j ison therefore is impracticable; tins puts j two items against it, distance and cost of j const met ion. Again: in the matter of traffic, everything ■ is in favor of the upper route, for necessarily, j so far as local traffic is concerned, the prop is- i ed road should consider freight rather than j passenger traffic. How do the the two routes i stand ? What is to lie expected from the 1 lower route, which throughout would secure lint the farm products of a not over-produc j live licit ? Practically but little. What recommends the upper route? An unbroken bed of minerals from Yellow Springs almost j to Emmitsburg, n> I one ton of which ore can ! Mini a market, except a railroad passes inline- j dlately hy it. From Yellow Springs to within i three miles of Emmil.-burg on the upper route lie a succession of rich deposits ol magnetic, specular and hematite ores, ochres and llints, which will be marketable and 1 outweigh, twenty to one, the shipments ol Ihe lower route. In addition to this the coke and iron tiafficof (’atoelin Furnaces, which may naturally lie expected to come under a nil lie; energetic management ere long, ol itself is a fair set-off agdnst the traffic over the iowir route. And the. hulk of the local j traffic Iliat tlie lower route won d secure, | would come to (be upper route anyhow. The development ot the mineral resouiees of the county can only be. secured by the upper route and we have shown that this alone j must be looked to for paying tialflc. This | makes the third item m favor of the upper route, i , Now, we will consider the sole inducement that the lower route offers and that Is the 1 seven nillis of railroad from Rocky Ridge to 1 Emmitsburg. It is to save some of the money 1 that lias been invested in liial road, that the people of Middletown Valley and Monocaey : Valley are asked to eome to it over unpro ductive hills and across the deep-sunken beds Ol Fishing, Hunting and Owens Creek. The : W. M. K R. eagerly seeks io operate every branch road that it can get its hands on If 1 there is promise ot profit in it, yet we call 1 attention to the suggestive fact that it does not operate the E. R it , and why? Because I it can not lie made to pay and that same seven miles of road will not pay the propos- - ed road, while its parallel from Mechanics- , town to Emmitsburg will not only pass hy , . immense and valuable magnetic ore beds, lull ; will lie within a stone’s throw of Ml. St. ; , Mary’s College and will cross Toms Creek ■ simply at a high water elevation and by easy , approaches. To stun up, we desire to see the two routes i surveyed and estimaUslaid liefore the people | of Middletown Valley and the oilier sections interested and when that is done we shall lie content to have both our judgment and lion- j esty ot purpose impeached if it does not I appear that the lower route is wholly imprac- j tieahlc. { Railroads are readily built on paper and j the Middletown Valley people may he relied j upon to consider both routes, before they , , finally adopt either. We do not understand j that the publication in divers daily and j weekly newspapers, of their intention to I build a railroad to Rocky Ridge fixes the j , matter; in fact, it does not fix it, but we , believe that, if after due examination of the two routes. Unit cia Rocky Ridge should prove to lie the more practicable, then via Rocky Ridge it will be built, for we believe , Middletown Valley will build a road to the Western .Maryland and that the present , movement will be the one to do it. The following extract from an article on 1 the subject, published in the last issue ol the ; V.dhi/ lieginler, gives an idea of the condition of I lungs over there : “Should the road lie constructed from | Middletown to Rocky Ridge, ahd (lie Em mitsburg road extended to Getlyshuag, there would he a direct line from Gettysburg and j tlie North to Middletown, crossing the Western Maryland road at Rocky Ridge. , We are glad to say that wo have never seen our people more united or more cnllui -1 slaslie. over any previous railroad project Unit ins been sprung here, than they arc over the present one. We think the time has at lasi eome when the people of Middle town Valley are about tired of being com- 1 polled to haul all their produce from 8 to 15 . miles over the mountain to Frederick or to | Clnggett’s Station, Washington county, in i order to reach a railroad station, or to go the same distance whenever they want lumber. : phosphate, lime, coal, merchandise., Ac, Ret everybody lend a helping hand and the roijd will In; built” Don’t forget that Osier carries Ihe most complete line of stoves ever handled in this Vicinity, and they are all good 100.
