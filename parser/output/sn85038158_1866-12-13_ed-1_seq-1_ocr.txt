F. OLAYTON'8, President's Message. Fellow-citizens of the Senate. and House of Itrprcucntnlivcs t A tUr briof Interval the Congress of the United States renumps itn annual IpjrlHln tive labors. An all-wiao and merciful Providence has abated the posvtllence which vialted our adores, lcnvlnu; iu calamitous traeea upon aomo portions of our country. Tence, order, tranquility, and civil author ity have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the United States. In all of the States civil authority has su perseded the coercion of arms, and the people by their voluntary actions, are maintaining their governments In full ac tivity and complete operation. The en forcement of the laws U no longer "ob structed In any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings;" and the animosities engendered by the war are rap idly yielding to the beneficent influences of our free institutions, and to the kindly effects of unrestricted social and commer cial intercourse. An entire restoration of fraternal feeling must bn the earnest wIhu of every patriotic heart ; and we will have accompliHhed our grandont national achievement, when, forgetting the sad events of the past, and remembering only their Instructive lessons, we resume our onward career as a free, prosperous, and united people. In my message of the 4th of December, 1805, Congrefta was Informed of the meas ures which had been instituted bv the Ex ecutive wilh a view to the gradual restora tion ortlio States in which theinaurrection occurred to their relations with the Gener al Government. Provisional Governors had been appointed. Conventions called, Governors elected, Legislatures assembled, and senators and Representatives cnosen to the Congress of the United States. Courts had been opened for the enforce ment, or laws long in abeyance. The block- acre had been removed, custom-houses re established, and the Internal revenue lows put In force, in order that the people might coniriDute to the national Income. Postal operations had been renewed, and efforts were being made to restore thorn to their rornier condition of efficiency. The Stutes themselves had been asked to take part in inn hi an function of amending the Consti tution, and of thus sanctioning the extinc tion of African slavery us one of the lezltl ninte result of our Jnto,olue struggle. Having progressed tints fur, the Execu tive Department fonnd that it had accom plished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional authority. One thing, however, yet remained to be done before tho work of restoration could be completed, and that was the admission to Congress of loyul Senators and Represen tatives from the Statos whose people had rebelled against the lawful authority of the General Government. This question de volved upon the respective Houses, which, by the Constitution, are made the judges of elections, returns, and qualifications of their own monilwr.s ; and its consideration at once engaged tho attention of Congress. In the meantime, the Executive Depart ments no other plan having been proposed by Congress continued its efforts to per fect, as liiras was practicable, the restora tion of tho proper relations between the citizens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time to time, as tho pttblio interests seemed to require, the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the country. With the advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary officers were appointed, and ap propriations madoby Congress for the pay ment nf their salaries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution, so ns to prevent the existenco of slavery vi thin the United States or anv place sub octto their jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite nnmoer or States ; and on the 18tta day or December, 1865, it was officially declared to have become valid an a part of tho Con stitution of the United States. All of the States in which the insurrection had exist ed promptly amended their Constitutions, so as to make them conform to the great change thus effected in tho organio law of the land ; declared null and void all ordi nances and laws of secession ; repudiated all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes of the In surrection j and proceedod,in good faith, to the enactment of measures for the pro tection and amelioration of the condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation ; and it was not until to wards the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception was made in fa vor of Tennessee, by the admission of her Senators and Representatives. I deem It a subject of profound regret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to seats loyal Senators and Representatives from the other States, whose inhabitant", with those of Tennessee, had. en"'ici in the robellioD. Ten Statemore than one fourth of the w'u0.d number remain with out presentation ; the scats of fifty mem bers In the House of Representatives and of twenty members in tlie Senate are yet vacant not by their own consent, not -by a failure of election, but by the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, it is believed, would have ac complished much toward the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one peo ple, and removed serious cause - for dis content on tho part of the Inhabitants of those States. It would have accorded with the great principle enunciated in tho Dec laration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear tho burden of tax ation, and yet be denied the right of rep resentation. It would have been in con sonance with the express provisions of the Constitution, that "each Stale shall have at least one Representative," and "that no State, without Its consent, shall be depriv ed of Its equul suffrage in the Senate." Those provisions were intended to secure to every Slate, and to the people of every State, the right of representation in each House of Congress ; and so Important was It deemed by the framers of the Constitu tion, that the equality of tho States In tho Senate should bo preserved, that not even by an amendment of the Constitution cau any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch of tho National Leg islature. ' It Is true, It has been assumed that the existence of the Slates was terminated by the rebellious acts) of their inhabitants, and that the Insurrection having been sup pressed, they woro thenceforward to be considered merely as conquered territo ries. The Legislative, Executive, and Ju dicial Departments of the Government have, however, with great distinctness and uniform consistency, refusod to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and with the professed .objecta of the war. Through out the recent legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes Itself apparent, that theso ten pollUcul communities are - noth ing less than States of this Union. At the very commencement of the rebellion, each House declared, with a unanimity as re markable as It wan significant, that tho war was not "waged, upon our part, in any spirit of opprfnalon, nor for any pur pose of conquest or subjugation, nor pur pose of overthrowing or Interfering with the rights or established Institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; and that as soon ns these ob ject were accomplished the war ought to cease." In some Instances, Senators were permitted to continue their legislative func tions, while in other Instances Representa tives were elected and admitted to seats af ter their States had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union, and were endeavoring to maintain that tight by force of arms. All of the States whose people were in Insurrection, as State, wore Included In the apportionment of the direct tax of twenty millions of dollars an nually laid npon the United States by the act approved fith August, 1801. Congress, by the act of March 4, 180'2, and by the ap portionment of representation thereunder, also recognized their presence as States in the Union ; and they have, for Judicial purposesbocn divided into districts, as States alone can be divided.' The same recognition appears in the recent legisla tion in reference to Tennessee, which evi dently rests upon the fact that the func tions of the State were not destroyed by tho reliollion, but merely suspended ; and that principle Is of course npplicablo to those States which, like Tennessee, at tempted to renounce their places in the Union. The action of the Executive Deportment of the Government upon this subject has been equally definite and uniform, and the put pose of the wur was specifically stated In tho Proclamation Issued by my prede cessor on the 22d day of September, !Kti2. It was then solemnly proclaimed and de clared that "hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the constitutional re lation between the United States and each of the States and the people thereof, in which State that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed," The recognition of iho States by tho Ju dicial rcrartment of tho Government has also been clear and conclusive in all pro ceedings affecting them as States, had In the Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts. In the admission of Senators and Repre sentatives from any and all of the Slates, thero can be no just ground of apprehen sion that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with tho powers of legislation ; for this could not happen when the Constitu tion and the laws are enforced by a vigi lant and faithful Congress. Each House is made the "judge of the elections, re turns, and qualilications of its own mem bers," and may, "with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member." When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election, he may at once be admitted or rejected ; or, should thero lie any question as to his eligibility, his cre dentials may bo referred for Investigation to the appropriate committee. If admitted to a seat, it must lie upon evidence satis factory to the House of which ho thus bo comes a member, that he possesses the re quisite constitutional and legal qualifica tions. If refused admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the Govern ment, and returned to his constituents, they arc admonished that none but per sons loyal to tho United States will lie nl lowed a voice In the Legislative Councils of the Nation, and the political power and moral Influence or Congress nre thus ef fectively exerted in the interests or loyalty to the Government and fidelity to tho Union. Upon this question, so vitolly of rectingthe restoration of the Union and the permanency of our present form of gov ernment, my convictions, heretofore ex pressed, have undergone no change ; but, on the contrary, their correctness has leen confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission or loyal members to seats in tho respective Houses of Congress was wlso and expedient a year ago, it Is no less wise and expedient now. If this anomalous condition Is right now If, in the exact condition of these States at the present time, It is lawful to exclude them from representation, I do not see that the ques tion will be changed by the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger the right of exclusion will be no weaker. The Constitution of tho United States mokes it the duty of tho President to rec ommend to the consideration of Congress "such measures a he shall judge ;,ecessa ry or expedient," J "Know of no measure mQTS imperatively demanded by every consideration of nationnl Interest, sound policy and equal justice, than the admis sion oi loyoi members irom the now un represented States. This would consummate the work of restoration, and exfrt a most solutary influence In the re-establishment of peace, harmony, and fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the confi dence of tho American people In the vigor and stability of their institutions. It would bind us more closoly as a nation, and enable us to show to the world the In herent and recuperative, power of a Gov ernment founded upon the will of the peo ple, and established npon the principles of ti oerty, justice, ana Intelligence. Our in creased strength and enhanced prosperity would Irrefragably demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free Institutions drawn from our recent national disorders by the enemies of republican government. The admission or loyal members rrom the States now excluded from Congress,' by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital, now awaiting an opportunity for Investment, into the channels of trade and industry. It would allo iate the pres ent troubled condition of those States, and, by Inducing emigration, aid In the settle ment of fertile regions now uncultivated. Hud leud to an increased production of those staples which have added so greatly to the wealth of the nation and the com merce of the world. New fields of enter prise would be opened to our progressive people, and soon the devastations of war would be repaired, and all traces of our do mestic d I (Terence) effaced from tho mlndsof our sountrymen. In our efforts to preserve "tho unity of Government which constitutes us one peo ple," by restoring the States to the condi tion whloh they held prior to the rebellion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescued our nation from perils of threatened dis integration, we resort to consolidatloni and in the end absolute despotism, as a reniferiy for the recurrence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, find with It all occasion for the exorcise of powers of doubtful constitutionality, we should hast en to bring legislation within the boun- daries prescribed by the Constitution, and return to the ancient landmarks estab- llshod by our fathers for tlm guidance of. succeoding generations. "The Constitu tlon which at anytime exists, until chang ed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, Is sacredly obligatory upon, all." "If, la the opinion of the pco'ple, t he. distribution or modification of the consti tutional powers lie, in any particular, wrong, let It be corrected by n amend ment in the way In which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurimtion j ' for-"it Is the customary woatKin by which free Governments are destroyed." Washington spoke theso words to his countrymen, when, followed by their love and gratitude, he voluntarily retired from the cares or public life. "To keep In all things within tho pale of our constitutional powers, Mid cherish tho Federal Union as the only rock of safety," were prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear" to bis "countrymen the true principles of their Constitution, and promote a union of sentiment and action equally ausplcloui to their happiness mid snrcty." Jackson held that the action or the General Government should always bo strictly confined to the sphere of Its ap propriate duties, and Justly and forcibly urged Unit our Government is not to bo maintained nor our Union preserved "by in vasions of thu rights and powers of the several States. In thus itttemi.tintf to make our General Government strong, we make It weak. Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and Stales us much as possible to themselves ; in imiking it self felt, not In Its power, but In its benr flcence; n.it in its control, but in Its pro tection; not In binding tho Slate-i more closely to the center, but leaving each to move unobstructed iu lis proper constitu tional orbit." These are tho teachings of men whoso deeds and services have made them Illustrious, and who, long since withdrawn from the scenes of life, have leit to their country tho rich legacy of iheir example, their wisdom, und their patriot ism. Drawing rrcsli inspiration from their Icssoiiri, let us emulate them In love of country and respect for tho Constitution ami tho laws. The report of tho Secretary of the Treas ury affords much information respecting the revenue and commerce of Ibo country. Ills views upon the currency, mid wiih reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue system, internal as well as impost, are commended to tho careful considera tion of Congress. In my last annual mes sage I expressed my general views upon these subjects. I need now only call at tention to (ho necessity of carrying into every deportment ot tho Government n system of rigid accountability, ihoroitch retrenchment, and wise oeouomy. With no exceptional nor unusual exnenditures. the oppressive burdens or taxation can lc lessened by such a modification of our revenue laws as will be consistent wilh the public faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a much moro satis factory condition of our finances than one yeor ago the most sanguine could have an ticipated. During tho fiscal year ending the 30th Jrne, the last' year of the war, tho public debt was increased $((41. 002,5:17, and on tho Slst of October, lsti,", it amounted to $2.710.854.7511. On the Slst day of October. ISfiO, it had been reduced to $2,55I,S 11,001), tho diminution, during n IK'riotl or fourteen months, commencing September 1, 1Si;5, and ending October 31, lRtlH, having been $2ii(i,37!l,5(i5. In the last annual report on the stute of the fi nances, it was estimated that during tho three quarters of the fiscal veor ending the 30th of June last, the debt would be in creased $1 12, 1H4.047. Durinsr that period. however, it was reduced $31,100,387. the re ceipts of the yerr having been S8l,'.l(ln,(in5 more, and the expenditures $200,520,235 less than the estimates. Nothing could more clearly Indicnto than these state ments the extent and availability or the national resources, and tho rapidity and safety wilh which, under our form of eov- ernment, great military and nnvai estab lishments can bo disbanded, and expenses reduced from a wnr to a pence footlncr. During the fiscal year ending the 801 h of June, 18(1(5, the receipts were $558,032,020, and the expenditures $520,750,040, leaving an available surplus of $37,281, flso. It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 3()lh June, 1807. will lie $475,061,38(1, and that thecxpenditurcs will reach the sum of $316,428,078. leaving In the Treasury a surplus of $158,633,308. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1866,11 is estimated that tho receipts will amount to $43,000,000, and that tho expenditures will bo $350,247,641 showing an excess of $85,- 752,351) in fuvor of the Government Those estimated receipts may be diminish, f d by a reduction of excise and import do- ties; but after all necessary reductions shall have been made, tho revenue of the present and of the following years will doubtless bo sufficient to cover all legiti mate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a large annual surplus to be applied to the payment of the principol of the debt. '1 here seems now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances In population nnd wealth, and yet tho debt bo extinguished within the next quarter of a century. The report of the Secretary of Wnr fur nishes valuable and Inporta'nt Information In reference to the operations of his De partment during the past yeor. Few vol. unteersnow remain in tlie service, and they are being discharged ns rapidly os they can be replaced by recrular troops. The army has leen promptly paid, careful ly provided with medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and is to be fur nished wilh broech-loading small arms The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the discharge of vol unteers, tho disposition of unserviceable or porishablo stores, and the retrenchment of expenditure. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been retained, and, from the disbanded volunteers stand ing ready to respond to tho nationnl coll, large armies can bo rapidly oreanlred, equipped, and concentrated. Fortifica tions on tho coast and frontier have receiv ed, or are Ix-ing prepared for more power ful armaments; lake surveys and harbor ana river improvements are In coarse energetic prosecution. Preparations hove been niade for tho payment of the addi tional bounties authorized during the re cent session of Congress, under such regu lations as will protect tlie Government from fraud, and securo to the honorably discharged soldier the well-earned reward or his fulthrultiess and gallantry, More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus; and forty-one nationnl cemete ries, containing the remains of 104,520 Union soldiers, have already been estab lished. The total estimate 0( military ap propriations la $29,05,660, It is stated In tho report of the Secretary of the Navy that the naval force at this time consists of fwr-ininrlred and revefity to eight vessels, armed with two Ihotisitm! three hundred nn.l rlfty-ono arms. Of ii these, one hundred and llfieen vertls, cor- rylng one thousand and tweuty-auluc guns, are In commission, distrilmted 'hlell.v among seven squadrons. The mimler of men tn the service Is thirteen tlwiiisnnd six hundred. Great activity nnd vigilnnce have Won displayed by all tho squadrons, and their movements have been judicious- ly ana etliclently arranged In such manner as would best promote American com merce, and protect the rlghbT'tind Interests of our countrymen abroad. Tho vessels unemployed nre undergoing repairs,, or are laid up until their services may be re quired. Most of the Iron-clad fleet Is st league Island, In the vicinity of Philadel phia, a place which, nntil decisive action should be taken by Congress, was selected by tlie Secretory of tho Nnvy as the most eligiblo location for that Class or vessels. It is Important that a suitable public sta tion should be provided for the Iron-lod fleet. It is intended that theso vessels shall lie in proper condition for any emergency, und It is desirable that ti e bill iiceeptlmr I"aiiio Island for nnval purposes, which passed the House nf Itepr.wntot.ives at lis last session, should receive final action a', an early period, In order that there may I a suitable public station . lor this clan's of vessels, ns well us it n ivy-vnrd of area sufficient for the wants of the service, on the Delaware river. The Naval lYnsion fund amounts to $11,750,000, having Wit Increased $2,750,000 during the yeari The expenditures oflhe Department' for the fis cal year ending 30! h June Jnf, were $13.- 324,520, and the estimates Tori ho coining yesr amount to $23,5.fi,4:!rt.

Tho sug- " gestlons In behalf of this deserving class of our fellow-cltlzens uro earnestly "recom mended to tho favorable utlonlion of Con gress.

Iho revenues of the Department for the your ending June 30, lKUrl, went $14,386,080, and the expenditures $15,352. 07H, showing an excess of tho hitter of $!'05,0!i2. In anticipation of (his deficiency, however, a special appropriation was maris by Congress in tho net approved July 28, i860. Including tho standing nprroprio ation of $700,0011 for free mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet re maining unexpended, the actual deficiency for the past year is only S263,0!W a sum within $51,141 of the mount estimated In iho annual report of lstj t. Tho decrease of revenue compared with tho previous year was one and one-tin h per cent., met the increase of expenditures, ow ing prin cipally to the enlargement of the mail ser vice in the South, was twelve per cent. On tho 30th of Juno last, there were in opera tion six thousand nine hundred nnd thir.v mail routes, wijh an aggregate length o"f one hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred and tweuty-one miles, mi aggre gate annual transportation of sevonty-ono million eight hundred nnd thirty-seven thousand nine hundred nnd fourteen miles, and on ogtrregrto annual cost, including all expendltur. s of $8,410,1 H. Tho length or railroad routes is thirty-two thousand and ninety-two niiios, and the nnnual transportation thirty million six hundred and nine thousand four hundred nnd sixty seven miles. The length of Meambo'at routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty-six miles, and the annual trans-' porlation three million four hundred nmt eleven thousand nine hundred nnd slxtv Iwo miles. The mail service is rapidly in creasing throuihout the whole couiitrv, and its steady extension in tho Southern States indicates their constantly improving condition. The growing importance of tho foreign service also merits attention. Tho Post Office Department of Great Rritaia and our own have aiireed upon a prelimin ary busts for a new Postal Convention, w hich it is believed will prove eminently bene ficial to the corr.mercinl interests of the United States, inasmuch ns it contemplates a reduction of tho international letter pos tage to one-half tho cxistinor rates; a re duction of postogrt wiih nil other coun tries to and from which correspondence U transmitted Jn tie PHfish mail, or In clos ed mails through the United Kingdom ; the ostnbllsnicnt of uniform and reasonoblo charges for the sea and territorial transit of correspondeni in closed mails; nnd an allowance to each Post Office Department oftho right to use all mail communications established under tho authority 'of tho oth er for tho dispatch of correspondence, either In open or closed moils, on the samo terms as tins? applicable to tho inhabl finis of tho country providing tho mean of transmission. Tlie report of the Secretary of the Intori or exhibits the condition of those branches of the public service which ore committed to his supervision. During the lost fiscal year, four million six hundred and twonty nino thousand three hundred nnd twelve acres of public land were disposed of, onn million debt hundred nnd Jiinoty-twu thousand five hundred ond sixteen "acres of which were entered under the home stead act. The policy originally adopted relative to the public lands has unriorgona essential modifications. . Imined.'ate re venue, and not their rapid sett'.eiiiont, was the cardinal feat tire of our lat.d system.- Long experience and earnest discussion have resultod in the conviction that th.t early development of our agricultural re source, and the diffusion of an enerpelle population over our vast territory, are ob jects of far greater Intportahce'to the na lionnl growth nnd prosperity tllsn the pro ceeds of the snle of Uio lands to the highest bidder in open market. The preemption laws confer upon tlie pioneer who cr mplies with the terms they Impose the privilege of purchasing a limited portion of "unoffered lands" at -the minimum price. The home stead enactments relie-o ti e settler from the payment of purchase money, and se cure him a permanent home, upon the con dition of residence for a term of years. This policy Invite emigration from, the old, and from the more orowded port"is of tlie new world. Its propitious results are undoubted, nnd will 1st morn signally manifested when time shall have given to It a wider development. . Congress has made liberal grants of pub lic land to corporations, In aid of the con .t ruction of railroads and. other Internal Improvements. Should this policy here after prei ail, more stringent provisions w ill be required lo securo a failhlul ap plication of the fund. The title to the lands should not pass, by patent or other wise, but remain In the ' Government and subject to its control until some portion of the road baa been actually built. . Tor tions of them might then, from time t time, be conveyed to the corporation, bus never in a greater ratio to the wbk vjwau llty embraced by the arrant thn the xm fltlrd pda ls-ar lo th ut!r Wnyb. f
