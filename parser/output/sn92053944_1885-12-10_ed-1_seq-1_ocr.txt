CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE ABROAD. Wliut the l.omloti Tress Thin kit of It Foreign MUeelltmy. London, Pec. 10. The Daily News (Lib eral), commenting ukjii the president's iirst message to congress, says tiiat the message seems to place Mr. Cleveland in true suc cession to the great men who have occupied the American presidential chair rather than in the late Democratic line. The message, it says, is conceived in the- most just and friendly spirit toward all foreign jiowers, and there is no word to tickle the ears of American jingo. It i.i a message of in ternational giRxl will, and it is equally wise and prudent on domestic topics. The Standard says the message is tcm jHTate and dignified. It goes far toward justifying President Cleveland's election, and contrasts favorably with some of Seere taries Frclinhuyseii and Blaine's wild dis patches. Tho president's iolicy is on the whole worthy of adoption. The Standard adds that Austria's action in the Keiley matter accords with well undei-stRn prece dents. If the right to refuse an exequatur eon Diets with the American constitution, tho sooner the republic's municipal laws are put in keeping with international law, the less such dihVulties aie likely to occur. The morning 1'ost says that some Old World statesmen might ponder with benetit the reasons given by President Cleveland for his conservative and unutl venturous ac tion regarding the projected treaty between the United States and Nicaragua. The Times says the message reflects in a tranquil, unexciting paragraphs the happy detachment from international jealousies and quarrels, which it is the jHH-uliar good fortune of America, tottijoy.
