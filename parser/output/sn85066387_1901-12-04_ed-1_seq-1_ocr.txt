PRICE FIVE CE1STS. LAWMAKERS UNITE FOR EXCLUSION Words of the President Make' the Victory ; More Certain. California Delegation Able to Command Success With- ; out Committees, By C. C. CARLTON. Special Dispatch to The Call. CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N. W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. «. — The President's positive ree ommendatlon to Congress that the Chinese exclusion act be re-enacted immediately and strengthened in weak spots dispells any doubt that may nave existed as to the bill's fate. Senator Lodge, who Is the administration's spokesman, will to-mor row introduce a bill to make Chinese ex clusion permanent and not for a term cf years, as in the case of. the so-called Geary. act. Lodge's bill merely continues the present law indefinitely and has Pres ident Roosevelt's approval. : . Senator Lodge realizes ; that the act must be amended, but he Introduced It in this form merely to gain for it an early place on the calendar of the regular bust ness to be transacted in the Senate. It will thus be reached early In the session • And in -regular order. There will be no necessity of suspending the rules, and rushing it through under such suspension at the eleventh hcur, as was the case en a former occasion. --- Are a Unit. ' Under a suspension of the rules It re quires a two-thirds vote to pass a meas ure, but In the regular order a majority of the votes is sufficient. When the bill is reached it will be discussed at length and amendments now being drawn by Commissioner of Immigration Powdetly will. make It more effective In accordance with President Roosevelt'g recommenda tion. As it may be considered In a sense an administration measure it will mus ter the full Republican strength In Con gress, and this is sufficient to insure its passage. There are in the House 198 Republicans out of a total membership of 357. In the Senate are fifty- five Republicans out of a total membership of ninety. But Chinese exclusion will not be made a party quss* tion. The Democrats realize that tne passage of Chinese exclusion and anarch ist exclusion bills will be popular with the people at this time. It is prodlcted by those most familiar with the situation that the bill will pass by a big majority. It would not be putting it too strongly to say an \ overwhelming majority. Opposition Not Evident. "Thus far," said Representative Julius Kahn to-night, "we have not been able to locate any pronounced opposition, with the possible exception of Hitt of Illinois, chairman. of the Foreign -Affairs Com mittee. I have not talked with him re cently, but a few months ago during a conversation with me he expressed himself. as positively opposed to Chinese exclu sion or any other form of exclusion ..of what he termed industrious and respecta ble immigrants. It may be that he has changed his attitude. He is an influen tial member, but there is no doubt what ever of the bill's passage." " : . .- : There has always existed among, tha California members of Congress . tack of harmony and unity on matters affecting the welfare of the State.. This fact has become notorious in California, and some of the . members . admit it themselves. Sometimes their differences are caused by Jealousy - of "the prominence achieved bj an Individual member. . .To obviate this the Callfornians have had a meeting and decided, to call a caucus of all- the. Pa cific Coast delegations to consider the va rious exclusion bills that have been pre pared. ;Kahn has one, another, Mondell of Wyoming another and other* are in various stages of incubation. Composite Bill Planned. ,The bill to be urged will be a composite measure. The best features contained In the individual bills will be incorporated In the one to be adopted by the caucus of Pacific Coast Senators and member*. It is proposed to make it strictly non partisan.
