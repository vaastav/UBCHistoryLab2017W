The second annual Exhibition'of the Southern Minnesota Poultry and Pet-Stcck Association will be held at Rochester Dec. 30, 31 and Jan 1 aud Congress meta high noon last Mon ti ft}. The President's message was delivered to both houses soon after. The message is an able document and deals with all important questions. Mi*s Kate Schulzy, a young lady of Fort Plain, N. Y., has fasted 258 days, and is still alive, appar ently no weaker than when she last ate. It is a strange case. Pope county, this State, compos ed largely of Irish and Scandina vians, at the recent election plected a ticket which had been placed in the field by Good Templars. Rev. Dr. Burchard, of "Rum. Romanism and Rebellion" notorie ty, says that God overruled him to make that mistake, for some wise end. The reverend gentlemanis not only a fool but a knaviy^ well. The St. Jam' nail square1 say t* tr mm**- 9 the locrats inis- .J^treasury The same Buchanan's Dakota is rapping violently at the door of Congress for admission to the sisterhood of states. The 60,000 Republican majority given by the territory at the recent elec tion does not impress the Democrat ic members in Congress very favor ably. John H, Reagan is being highly recommended by the Southern chivalry for postmaster General un der Cleveland, because he held that office under the Confederacy. Cer tainly a good qualificationin the eyes of the Southern Yankee haters. The North Chicago Rolling Mills have been closed owing to dull trade, thus throwing 1,800 men out of employment. Many mills in Pennsylvania have also been closed. This will be a hard winter with the laborers in manufacturing munities. com- Hon. John L. Gibbs, of Free born county, is prominently men tioned in connection with the Speakership of the incoming legis lature Mr Gibbs served very ac ceptably as Speaker in 1877. Mr. Cornish, of St Paul, is also a can didate for the position. At the recent convention of stockmen, at St. Louis, a proposi tion was made to ask congress to set apart a strip of land ten milea wide extending from Texas to Mon tana, over which stock can be driv en from the soiilli to the north dur ing the grazing season. Hendricks going about the coun try thanking the democrats for electing "Cleveland and Hend ricks," as he is always sure to put it, presents a spectacle not unlike the dog's tail that wags when a piece of meat is put in the mouth at the front end of the animal. Ex. The negroes of Washington have asked permission to participate in the inauguration ceremonies of March 4th, but the Democratic managers gave them to understand that it was to be a white man's celebration. And yet we are told that the Democrats are the only true friends of thp colored man. Edward A. Keeler, convicted in October 1881 of robbing the mails, was releaeed from the Joliet peni tentiary last Friday, it having been ascertained beyond a doubt that he was innocent. Mr. Keeler was formerly a prominent politician of southern Minnesota, and grand foreman of the A. O. U. W. of the State. On to-day I he presidential elec tors will meet at the State capitol of their iespecti?e States and cast their ballots for President and Vice President of the United States, in accordance with the wishes of the people as expressed at the polls on Nov. 4th. Two hundred and nine teen electors will vote for Cleve land and Hendricks and one hund red and eight).two will vote for Blaine and Logan. Butler, St. John and Belya are excluded from the electoral college entirely. Father P. M. Kaeder, of Crown Point, Indiana, in a letter to Fath er Sylvester Malone, of Brooklyn, iboth being Catholic pastors" who supported Mr. Blaine) says: "Let me tell you that three days before the election several hundred thou sand dollars came to Indiana for the Democrats, which was distri buted in every precinct, $300 com. ing to Crown Point, $500 to Ham mond, in this county. With this corruption fund sufficient votes were bought in eyery precinct to carry the State for Cleveland. This, is a fact and you can give it to the press if you like." Fifty-one members of the old Ninth Minnesota recently met at Mankato and enjoyed a pleasant re union. A permanent organization was effected and Capt. J. M. Dan* niels of Rochester was elected presi dent and Rev. A. H. Kerr chaplain. The next re-union will be held at the same place, in June next. Senator Lamar, of Mississippi, has commenced suit in the United States Circuit Court against the Government to recover $100,000 for cotton taken from his plantation in 1865.Mr. Limar has .waited until the south "was in the sad- dle." We do not flatter ourselves that is the only claim of the kind thatthis will be presented. It is only the beginning, On Saturday, 22d ult., Mrs. John Wattacounit and a twelve year old daughter attempted to walk a dis tance of twelve miles, returning from the funeral ot the mother's sister to their home near Oconto, Wis. They evidently lost their way and perished by the severe cold in an intense swamp surrounding the Shawanee lake. The bodies were discovered by searching parties last Friday afternoon, frozen stiff. At a recent conference of mem bers of the State board of charities and correction with several trustees and superintendents of the Rochester and St. Peter hospitals for the insane, it was determined to ask the legislature to establish a third hospital. The large geo graphical extent of the state, and the long distances that seperate some of the most populous and im portant sections from the present hospitals, give point to this request. In a gulch near the Plum river, Neb., has been discovered a village of petrified prairie dogs. A party of hunters lately came upon this village and were surprised to see the dogs sitting up in their_ho!s. without fear. Expanniftion showed that aJL, wefe^ turned to stone. There were also a number of petri fied owls and snakes lying about as natural as in life. Mr. T. J. Smith, editor of the Western flews, at Ainsworth, Neb., vouches for the truth of this story. The New York Sun in an editor ial entitled "Manly in Defeat," has the following kind works to say of Blaine. A man's conduct la defeat in a sure teat of his quality. Especially is thia true of a roan whose temperament la neither doll nor elugish bat ac tive and vivacious People sa'd of Mr Blaine, when the returns began to indicate his defeat. "It will kill hiraj he is a sick man and will never set over it, this will be the end of him "Doubt less many of his friends feared that these predic tions would be verified. But they are pleasantly disappointed Mr. Blaine made a speech at Au gusta on Tuesday evening which shows more abili ty thin anything he did during the campaign, proves that he accepts the result of the election in manly spirit, and vindicates his title to be re garded to day, and in spite of the election, as one of the foi eraost, if not Indeed the very foremost, of the leaders of the Republican party Cincinnati Commerical Cazette: The colored people of the South are terri fied ,and this terror extends to the race in the North. The readiness with which those who were slaves believe that they are to be sold again into sla very is pitiful. Many ot them have been subjected to unfeeling jests on the subject, and their abject alarms have been mocked bv the brutal wretches who have imposed upon them. A friend who has been traveling in the South tells us that a favorite ceremony of am usement has been the holding of mock auctions, in which colored people were brought to the block and bid off in the old style with roars of devilish laughter an awful joke upon the poor black people There is a reign of terror in the South, and the chances are that the black people will flee in enormous num bers from the gulf states acioss the Mississippi, and that the whites who are not inclined to enter the torrent of barbarism and float with it will stream across the Ohio. Chicago Tribune: In reply to the Schurz-Edmunds-mugwump cackle that a stronger man than Blaine might have been nominated one who would easily be electel we submit the results of the con test as a whole. Mr. Blaine has been defeated by a few hundred votes in the state of New York, but his candidacy has effected a revolution and lifted a prostrate party to its feet. Some men for get where the elections of 1882 left the Republicans. J^r, Blaine's can didacy has redeemed seven Republi can statesOhio, Michigan, Wis consin, Kansas, Colorado, Nevada and Californiafrom Democratic rule, and given six of them Repub lican governors and legislatures and a gain in Republican congressmen and in almost every one of these states, popular as the Republican state candidates were. Blaine ran far ahead of them. These victories were made in the face of hostile majorities, with the Democrats in control of the voting machinery, and in spite of weightier obstacles than any other Presidential candi date has bad to encounter.

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington. Nov. 29th, 1884. The Democrats here find it im possible to conceal their itching palms. They are not in the habit of wearing gloves, and the clamor for office, already loud, bids fair to develop into a riot.. The questions every body is asking are Will Cleveland be able to resist the pressure, will he desire to resist it. Tbe general opinion is that he will desire and try, but will faij. He will set Mi massive shoulders against the postern, open it gingerly to let a few good democrats in, but a las when he shall try to close it, he will ftud that the "kw good democrats'" wej?e tjje entering wedge of the immense Y\-3haped "unwashed," and poor Cleveland will be as helpless as a child in a stampeded herd of Texas steers Ltffi mmmmmsmk wm "What are we here for if not for the offices" were the historic words of ex-Senator Flanagan of Texas, and they express the sentiment in the heart of the hungry, thirsty, unwashed democracy. Over 15,000 of the residents of Washington are in the employ of the Government in iU various branches. This estimate includes, beside the class known as Depart ment employes, the Army and Navy officers stationed here, the employes of the District Govern ment, those of the Navy yard, of the city post office, and other local offices, the employes of Congress and of the various courts. Natur ally the deepest interest is felt in every change of administration, but imagine what anxiety must pre vail when the "party of spoils" is on the war path. While the Republican party will be relieved for a time from the re sponsibility of government, it will be interesting to watch the Demo cracy blundering under its unac customed burdens. It is only to be hoped that it may blunder upon some useful reforms. A breadth of charity is needed to suggest this possibility, but this is an age of wonders. Commenting on the possibility of Democratic supremacy in the upper and lower branches of Congress a distinguished ex-Senator said: "If they should get their hooks on Con gress, they will first fix themselves to stay in power. This they will do by making two states of Texas, and admitting Utah as an offset to Dakota, which cannot be kept out much longer. That would give them four more senators and the Republicans two. Then enormous sums would be appropriated for, opening up the South, millions will be dumped into the Mississippi, a flood of cotton and other claims will be worked through. On next Monday at noon the stars anisipjges y[\[ beiioisted oTrH the Senate and House wings of the Capitol, and at the same hour the second session ot tbe Forty-eigth Congress will begin. On that day, or possibly a day later, President Arthur will transmit his last an nual message to Congress, his val edictory of 1884. He*has not yet finished this document, which, at this crisis, will be listened to with more than ordinary interest. The inauguration, and the dedi cation of the Washington monu ment are the two coming events most talked of now. The mer chants, hotel proprietors and the boarding house keepers who drive the chief industries of Washington expect to grow rich off the throngs of people that these two celebra tions will bring to the*city. It is said the inaugural ball will be held in the new Pension building, which have to be temporarily roofed with canvass or paper for the occassion. The top of the Washington monu ment is now among the clouds, and if it does not get too cold for the workmen up there, they cau give the finishing touches to the summit in about fifteen days. The improvement of this city goes on in spite of the disturbing influence which the recent election has had upon every kind of busi ness. The reason of this is that the census here continues to grow, be cause the attractions of the city as a place of residence are appealing each year to a wider circle of tastes. Now not alone the politicians but literary people, and those fund of society find here congenial associa tions, and surroundings. To supply homes for this new population de mands the investment of capital, and so long as this form of invest ment yieds more largely than any other speculation there will be no lack of investors.
