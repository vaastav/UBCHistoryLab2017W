It.? was learned today that a fine) poiyt of law is involved in the ques- j tioB of appealability in this case. In ! arfact effective January 1, 1912. cer- j tarn classes of cases that may be ap- | pealed from the District Court of Ap- : peals are defined. The only one of : these classes on which appeal might . be based, it was "stated, is that in | which the constitutionality of a law I at the United States is attacked. Be- . cause of the fact that the Saulsbury resolution applied only to the District of Columbia, it was stated, a grave : tfoubt arises as to whether or not it is to be properly defined as a law of the United States. Should the Su- i bre'me Court decide that the Sauls- , pury resolution, applicable only with-j in the District, is not a law of the j United States, it was stated, no appeal j would lie and the opinion of the Dis trict court would be final. Would >ot Stay Eviction. An appeal filed with only a cost bond, it was stated, would not serve ^o stay eviction proceedings, the only eans afforded by the law to prevent holesale evoctions under the opin ion of Justice Robb being the filing of a supersedeas bond with the ap p<al. Mr. Dav is. in discussing possible I farther proceedings, said: "No briefs were filed by either side in the case, nor was any argument made before the District Court of Ap peals. Its decision therefore embodies t its own conclusions, and is wide ?nough in its scope to cover the Ball rent law, which is to supersede the Saulsbury resolution, and there does not see.n to be much doubt the latter will be held unconstitutional when it Wipes before the Court of Appeals." Ie?ll Ball Rent Law aa ESftr Shell. "The Ball rent 1 %w becomes an empty shell' by reason of the deci sion of the Court of Appeals in de claring the Saulsbury resolution un constitutional." declared Charles W. Fairfax, president of the Real Estate Brokers' Association, today. "Presi dent Wilson should decline to name re^t commissioners and incur other axpenses necessary to install the ma chinery to administer such legislation. It only add to the t>urden of taxa tion to be paid by the people here and elsewhere. ""What relief can tenants obtain from the rent commission, when they know rn advance that owners have the right to dispossess them? With I no vacancies existing in houses and 1 apartments, tenants will meet the in- I crease rental demands in order to re- ; tain possession. As the rent commis si? cannot lawfully function. Con gress should immediate y repeal this i lafC. Builders will then feel permit ted to proceed unrestricted in the erection of all classes of rental prop erties, and in that manner eventually bring permanent relief to housing congestion. "By no other method can this prob . *?e solved. If temporary hard ship is experienced by some tenants, L'on^rress is to blame because of the ' unwise legislation enacted in oppo- ' to the advice of those who 1 ruliy understand local conditions. "Owners should recognize the sit- I uation and deal reasonably with their tenants. Those who have been fair ! with landlords should be treated lib- j eraHy. Tenants must expect to pay ! a rental that will ret owners a ' proper return on the value of the I property occupied; otherwise they I will unload their real estate and in- I vest in other channels. The high cost of labor and material for build ing construction necessitates a rental that appears excessive compared to the old and low schedule that ex isted prior to the war. Builders can not be expected to carrv the risk involveed unless they receive an in come sufficient to create a reserve fund to permit them to 'mark on" a fair percentage of depreciation in the future. "The attitude of tenants will guide builders and investors in their plans lo meet the situation. The welfare >f the future must he kfpt in mind if Washington is to go forward and hold its position as the nation's cap ital." Bail Law Is Unaffected by Decision, Says Senator The decision of the Court of Ap peals of the District holding the Sauls bury act prohibiting the eviction of tenants unconstitutional will not af l'ect the status of the Ball law provid ing for the appointment of a rent commission l'or the District of Colum bia. Senator Hall of Helaware said to "tlay. ^ ? "Our rent law." said Senator Ball, "does provide that the Saulsbury act shall continue in efTect for a period of sixty days after the appointment and confirmation of the District rent commission. But it is especially pro vided In the rent law that if any part of the law be held unconstitutional it shall not affect the remainder of the law. That being the case, it does not appear that the decision of the Court of Appeals i 11 regard to the Saulsbury act will have any bearing on the rent commission law. . "It emphasizes the necessity, how ever, for the speedy appointment of the rent commission, which is au thorized by Congress in a law that was approved by the President six j weeks ago. This commission should be appointed and confirmed by the Senate without further delay, so that it can get down to work. It is much j needed, and if the Saulsbury act i? finally declared unconstitutional the j rent commission will be more neces- { sary than ever. # ! ? 1 do not think that the rent com- , mission law is subject to the charge j of unconstitutionality. 1 have talked j to many lawyers in regard to it and the majority of them believe that our j law is constitutional. it does not seem to me to be subject to the ar gument advanced against the Sauls bury act by the Court of Appeals, In which it was charged that the Sauls bury act was discriminatory and did not apply to all alike. J The rent commission law provides merely for the regulation of rents by a commission, and I believe that Con gress has the power to enact such a! law for the District of Columbia. ? "OfVne thing 1 am certain, and that] is that the power of Congress to rejju- j late hotels and apartment houses in the District of Columbia exists. They ! are public; conveniences and subject to j regulations. Even if the court should! hold that the rent commission law was unconstitutional so far as pri vate dwellings are concerned, such a decision would not affect the law as it applies to apartment houses and ho tels." . Senator Ball said that lie supposed an appeal would be taken to the Su preme Court of the United States in the case involving the Saulsbury act. 120 Lawyers Get Notices to Quit in One Building Among the first tenants to receive notice to quit following the decision of Justice Kobb of the District Court of Appeal? voiding the Saulsbury resolu tion were 120 lawyers occupying rooms in the Columbian building, 416 oth btreet, directly opposite the courthouse. Allan E. Walker & Co.. as agent for George S. Rees, owner of the property, served notice on each tenant that pos session of his office would be required at the expiration of thirty days. , Information given to the tenant in the notice was to the effect that the owner had leased the building: to the War Department. Rumor has it that it is to be used for storage purposes by the government. Office rooms near the courthouse are limited, it is stated. Indignation reigns among the law yer-tenants. some of whom have been occupying offices in the bOilding for many years, and one as long a-s nine teen years. A meeting of protect is scheduled among the tenants for thi? afternoon, when it is expected the legal situation in reference to land lord and tenant will be discussed from every angle. Opinion among the. tenants seems to vary as to the efficacy of the no tice. Some of the lawyers hold that the Ball act is in effect despite the failure to name a commission to regu- j late rents, and that until that act is j declared unconatitutional no eviction | may take, place. Otherr see in the i action of Oie Court of Appeals yester day an indication that the Eall act | will not be upheld when a case under ; it reaches that tribunal, while still others hold that the act is inopera tive until-the commission has quali- ] fied and that the notice to quit is j legal. One firm of lawyers, taking the view that if the government needs the building it should not be incommoded, immediately rented offices in another building in the vicinity. M

RIVER. Mass., December 2.? The textile council has accepted an offer of a 12H P?*r cent advance in wages for all textile operatives in this city. TEXT OF PRESIDENT WILSON S MESSAGE TO 66TH CONGRESS (Continued from First Tags.) radical theories from seething Ku ropean renters pending such delay, from heartless profiteering result ing fn the increase of the cost of 1 living, and lastly from the machina I tions of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to nor mal conditions, this unrest will rapidly disappear. In the mean time. it doe* much evil. It seems to me that in dealing with this sit uation Congress should not be im patient or drastic, but should seek rather to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily to a peace basis, with ameliorated living con ditions under the minimum of re strictions upon personal liberty that is consistent with our recon struction problems. And it should arm the federal government with power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time tested institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change. however fundamental, there must be no interference, but towards passion and malevolence tending to incite crime and insur rection under guise cf political evolution there should be no len iency. Legislation to this end has been recommended by the Attorney General and should be enacted. In this direct connection, I would call your attention to my recom mendations on August 8. pointing out legislative measures which would be effective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living, which contributes so largely to this unrest. On only one of these recommendations has the Congress acted. If the gov ernment's campaign is to be effec tive. it is necessary that the other steps suggested should be acted on at once. lienevred Pood Contra!. I renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the present food control act as to the period of time in which it shall re main in operation. The Attorney General has submitted a bill provid ing for an extension of this act for a period of six months. As it now stands it is limited in operation to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal procla mation of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at once. The Department of Justice has built up extensive machinery for the pur- ? pose of enforcing its provisions; all of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provisions of this act are ex tended. During this period the Congress will have an opportunity to make similar, permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for Interstate commerce and to exclude them from inter state shipment, if the requirements of the law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperative ly necessary. The abuses that have grown up in the manipulation of prices by the withholding of food * stuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively pre vented. There can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legiti macy of such measures. As I pointed out in my last mes sage. publicity can accomplish a great deal In this campaign. The aims of the government must be? clearly brought to the attention of the consuming public civic organ izations and state officials, who are in a position to lend their assist ance to our efforts. Tou have made available funds with which to carry on this campaign, but there is no provision in the law author ising their expenditure for the pur pose of making the public fully informed about the efforts of the government. Specific recommenda tion has been made by the Attor ney General in this regard. I would strongly urge upon you its imme diate adoption, as it constitutes one of the preliminary steps to this campaign. > Herniation of Cold Storage. I also renew my recommenda tion that the Congress pass a law regulating cold storage as it is regulated, for example, by the laws of the state of New Jersey, which limit the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribe the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and require that goods released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the serv iceability of the law. for the pur pose we now have in view, if it were also prescribed that all goods released from storage for inter state shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market price at which they went into storage. By this means the purchaser would always be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. I would also renew my recom mendation that all goods destined for interstate commerce should in every case, where their form or package makes it . possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the hands of the producer. We should formulate a law re quiring a federal license of all cor porations engaged in interstate commerce, and embodying in the li cense, or in the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and prevent un conscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect othei; much-needed reforms in the business of interstate ship ment and in the methods of corpo rations which are engaged In It; but for the moment I confine my recommendations to the object im mediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living. Improved Labor Condltloaa. No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fall to note the absolute need off a definite program to bring about an improvement in the con ditions of labor. There can be no settled conditions leading: to in creased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital are to be antagonists in stead of partners. Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the interests of the whole nation, as distinguished from the interests of a class, must be applied to the so lution of this great and pressing problem. The failure of other na tions to consider this matter in a vigorous way has produced bitter ness and jealousies and antag onisms. the food of radicalism. The only way to keep men from agitat ing against grievances is to remove the grievances. An unwillingness even to discuss these matters pro duces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which eddeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and re pression. The seed of revolution is repression. The remedy for these things must not be negative in character. It "must be constructive. It must comprehend the general interest. The real antidote for the unreet which manifests itself is not suppression, but a deep considera tion of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy. Congress has already'?shown its willingness to deal with these in dustrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of labor. Tt lias sought to find a. way to prevent child labor. It has served the whole country by leading the way in developing the means of preserving and safeguard ing lives and health in dangerous industries. It must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genuine democratization of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work, in what e\er rank, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this purpose in mind that I called a conference to meet in Washington 011 December 1 to con sider these problems in aU their broad aspects, with the idea of bringing about a better understand ing between these two interests. Put Own Houw In Order. The great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand for an immediate con sideration of the difficulties be tween capital and labor, bids us put our own house in order. Frank ly. there can be no permanent and lasting settlements between capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been struggling through the years. The whole world gave its recognition and indorsement to these fundamental purposes in the league of nations. The statesmen gathered at Versailles recognized the fact that world stability could not be had by reverting to indus trial standards and conditions against which the average work man of the world had revolted. It is, therefore, the task of the states men of this new day of change and readjustment to recognize world conditions and to seek to bring about, through legislation, condi tions that will mean the ending of age-long antagonisms between capital and labor, and that will hopefulily lead to the building up of a comradeship which will result not only in greater contentment among the mass of workmen, but also bring about a greater produc tion and a greater prosperity to business itself. To analyze the particulars in the demands of labor is to admit the Justice of their complaint in many matters that lie at their basis. The workman demands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live id comfort, unhampered by the fear of povertv and want in his old age. He demands the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary surroundings, both in home and in workshop, surroundings that develop and do not retard his own health and ?well-being; and the right to provide for his children's wants in the mat ter of heaBth and education. In other words, it is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the lives of those dear to him tolerable and easy to bear. War to Industrial Peace. The establishment of the principles regarding labor laid down in the covenant of the league of nations offers us the way to industrial peace and conciliation. No other road lies open to us. Not to pursue this one is longer to invito enmities, bitter ness and antagonisms which in the end only lead to industrial and so cial disaster. The unwilling work man is not a profitable servant. An employe whose industrial life is hedged about by hard and unjust conditions, which he did not create and over which he has no control, lacks that fine spirit of enthusiasm and volunteer effort which are the necessary ingredients of a' great pro ducing entity. Lot us be frank about this solemn matter. The evidences of world-wide unrest which manifest themselves in vio lence throughout the world bid us pause and consider the means to be found to stop the spread of this con tagious thing before it saps the very I vitality of the nation itself. Do we gain strength by withholding the | remedy? Or is it not the business of statesmen to treat these manifesta tions of unrest which meet us on every hand as evidences of an eco nomic disorder and to apply con structive remedies wherever neces sary. being sure that in the applica tion of the remedy we touch not the vital tissues of our industrial and economic life? There can be no re cession of the tide of unrest until constructive instrumentalities are set up to stem that tide. Governments must recognize the right of men collectively to bargain for humane objects that have at their base the mutual protection and welfare of those engaged in all In dustries. Dabor must not be longer treated as a commodity. It must be regarded as the activity of human beings, possessed of deep yearnings and desires. The business man gives his best thought to the repair and replenishment of his machinery, so that its usefulness will not be im N. B. 

GASKELL MAY FILL TRADE COMMISSION POST i Nelson B. Haskell, who served as assistant attorney general during sev eral republican administrations, will be nominated by President Wilson to fill the vacancy on the Federal Trade ? Com mission caused by the resignation of Franklin Fort, former Governor of (New Jersey, who has retired from the 'commission because of ill health. Mr. Fort was taken sick last sum mer at Carlisle. Pa. where he had gone to make a speech, and though he remained on the commission at the earnest solicitation of the President, his health will not oermit him to con tinue in that ottice. Tt is expected that Mr. G&skfttTs nomination will be sent to the Senate today. paired and its power to produce may always be at its height and kept in full vigor and motion. No less regard ought to be paid to the human machine, which after all propels the machinery of the world and is the great dynamic force that lies back of all industry and progress. Return to the old . standards of wage and industrv in , employment are unthinkable. The | terrible tragedy of war which has ; just ended and which has brought { the world to the verge of chaos j and disaster would be in vain if ! there should ensue a return to the conditions of the past. Europe it j self, whence has come the unrest I which now holds the world at bay. I is an example of standpatism in these vital human matters which | America might well accept as an ? example, not to be followed but ; studiously to be avoided. Europe made labor the differential, and ; the price of it all is enmity and j antagonism ana prostrated indus try. The right of labor to live in j peace and comfort must be recog nized '?>' governments and America should be the first to lav the j foundation stones upon which in i dustrial peace shall be built. I Caul "Ploy** Capital nn? Labor. Labor not only is entitled to | an adequate wage, but capital j should receive a reasonable re turn upon its investment and is j entitled to protection at the bands j of the government in every emer gency. No government worthy of | the name can "play" these "ele ) ments against each other, for there is a mutuality of interest between j lhem which the government must I seek to express and to safeguard j at all cost. i The right of individuals to strike I is inviolate and ought not to be interfered with by any process of | government, but there is a pre dominant right and that is the right of the government to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the j challenge of any class. The gov | ernment, when it asserts that right, seeks not to antagonize a class but simply to defend the right of the whole people as against the irreparable harm and ! injury that might be done by the attempt by any class to usurp a power that only government It self has a right to exercise as a protection to all. In the matter of international disputes which have led to war, statesmen have sought to set up as a remedy arbitration for war. j Does this not point the way for the settlement of industrial dis I put.es. by the establishment of a tribunal, fair and just alike to all, which will settle industrial dis putes which in the past have led to war and disaster? America, wit nessing the evil consequences which have followed out of such disputes between these contending forces, must not admit itself impo tent to deal with these matters by means of peaceful processes. Sure ly, there must be some method of bringing together in a council of peace and amity these two great interests, out of which will come a happier day of peace and co-op eration. a day that will make men more hopeful and enthusiastic in their various tasks, that will make for more comfort and happiness' in living and a more tolerable condi tion among all classes of men. Certainly human intelligence can devise some acceptable tribunal for adjusting the differences between capital and labor. America's Honr ?( Trial. This is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and strength and the indomitable cour age of her soldiers, she demon strated her power to vindicate on foreign battlefields her conceptions of liberty and justice. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to settle matters of purely domestic concern be pro claimed to the world. Th?re are those in this countrv who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority. Rus sia today, with its blood and ter ror. is a painful object lesson of the power of minorities. It makes little difference what minority it is. whether capital or labor or any other class, no sort of priv ilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country. We are a partnership or nothing that is worth while. We are a democracy where the majority are the mas ters. or all the hopes and purposes of the men who founded this gov ernment have been defeated and forgotten. In America there is but one way by which great reforms can be accomplished and the re lief sought by classes obtained, and that is through the orderly processes of representative gov ernment. Those who would pro pose any other method r>f reform are enemies of this country. Amer ica will not be daunted by threats nor lose Hfcr composure "or calm ness in these distressing times We can afford, in the midst of this day of passion and unrest, to be self-contained and sure. THe instrument of all reform in Amer ica is the ballot. The road to economic and social reforhi in America is the straight road of justice to all classes and conditions of men. Men have but to follow this road to realize the full fruition of their objects and purposes. Let those beware who would take the shorter road of disorder and rev olution. The right road is the road of justice and orderly process.

FRICK, LEADER IN U. S. STEEL, DEAD ^Continued from First Page.) mew's Church, and John C. drier, the financier's closest business adviser. Knowledge of Air. Prick's illness was not general, although his close friends knew he had been seriously ill. Dr. Conner said today that Mr. Prick had shown for the last month symptoms of an organic affection of the heart which presumably was the i result of severe attacks of infiamma | tory rheumatism, to which he was 'subject in early life. The physician declared Mr. Prick's death came "in the midst" of what seemed to be sat isfactory improvement in his con dition. The funeral, which will be private, probably will be held tomorrow after noon at the family home. The services will be conducted by the Rt. Rev. I Charles Sumner Buri-h, bishop of the Episcopal diocese of New York. Burial will.be in Pittsburgh. Life Story Kamcinntinjr. The career of Henry Clay Prick has formed one of the most fasci- j nating chapters in the romance of' industry in the I'nited States. At ten a boy on a farm in a family of only ordinary means, he was at sixty a man of so many millions that his fortune, like those of Car negie and Rockefeller, was largely a matter of guesswork, even to him self. It has been said he was worth more than $100.000,000f perhaps as much as $200,000,000. Ml-. Prick built up the greatest coke business in the world, and ac quired such vast interests in steel that he was also one of the princi pal magnates in that industry, and in rounding out his career he be came known as one of the world's greatest collectors of master paint ings. Mr. Prick was born December 19, 1S49. at West Overton, Pa. This vil lage was named after the maternal I grandfather of Mr. Frick. Abram Overholt, whose original family name was Oberholtzer. and who settled in western Pennsylvania when that region was regarded as the frontier of civilization. As the settlements along the Allegheny and Mononga hela grew, and Pittsburgh emerged i from its swaddling clothes Mr. Over holt became the leading miller and distiller of western Pennsylvania. His daughter. Elizabeth, married John W. Frieze, a yoi^g man of Swiss ancestry, who at tha^time was workinfw?as an engineer in the Overholt distillery. It was from this union that the fu ture capitalist was bom. The father attempted farming, but did not make a remarkable success of it and as a result young Henry Clay Frick was practically adopted into the Overholt family when he -was about twelve years old. He received a good basic schooling, but there was nothing in his boyhood to indicate the remarkable ability which char acterized his later life, except his eagerness to get into business. Interest In Coke Business. For a time he was bookkeeper in his grandfather's distillery, and from this position he went to Morgan & Co., coke dealers, and at about twenty-one years of age he appeared in Pittsburgh as their agent. The coke industry was in its infancy. The iron masters of Pittsburgh were just beginning to appreciate the value of coke for their furnaces. Young Frick had an opportunity to acquire a lim ited interest in a plant near Broad ford. and out of the profits of this he acquired other holdings. He later joined a company to build a railroad to penetrate the Connelsville coke region, and in 1S71. the year this road was opened, Mr. Frick organized the I corporation of Frick & Co.. which I bought coal land and coke ovens in the Connelsville region. That was I the basis of the Frick fortune. The {undivided attention of the rising financier was given to coke until 1882. In the midst of this period there came the panic of '73 and the.financial crash of many ambitious operators At a sheriff s sale Mr. Frick purchased additional tracts of coal land and |ovens, an# a. few years later the Mei [lons. powerful Pittsburgh bankers. | beoanie?ijit<?rested in the expanding ] enterprise of the young operator. Alliance With Carneffles. ! The Carnegies. then developing i their great steel business in Pitts j burgh, had taken large holdings in the f rick Coke Company, and in 1SS2 found the Carnegie brothers willing to admit him as a member-of their firm in consideration of his giv ing them further interests in his coke business. It was thus Mr. Frick be came also & great manufacturer of steel. ic^iirti2gh Homestead strike of 159- Mr. Frick came into national .prominence when Alexander Berkman, ! a New York anarchist, tried to assas sinate him. 1 When he entered the Carnegie Steel ti/L.^ny he decided to make it the most powerful concern in the steel world. Two of his immediate ven tures netted the Carnegie concern many millions of dollars with scarce ly no investment. He built the Union railroad to weld the scattered Carne gie plants closer together. This elim- i mated the switching charges and saved enormous sums for the Carnegie company. It was Mr. Frick who lafer * ,arge Portion of the Mes EtV/'. ^Id?S' ?"

He also became one of the I largest holders of real estate in Pitts-' burgh. He was one of the largest owners of Pennsylvania railroad stock, was one of that company's di rectors. and its dominating: factor. He was also a power in Reading. Baltimore and Ohio. Norfolk and Western, and other railroads. On December 15. 1SS1, Mr. Frick was married to Miss Ada Howard I Childs of Pittsburgh. Four children > were born to them?two boys and two I girls.

Frick at his office in Pittsburgh July 22. 1892, and was sentenced to a term of twen ty-one years in the penitentiary for the crime, when informed of Frick's death today, said: "It is too bad he cannot take the millions he amassed by exploiting labor with him."
