Archbishop Ireland preached last Sunday at St. Patrick's Church, Wash ington, i. C'., on tile Pope's temporal sovereignty. He contended that the Italian government should have re mained somewhere outside of Rome. The transport Hancock arrived at San Francisco last Tuesday from Ma nila with the corpses of about 1,500 American soldiers aud sailors who either were killed in battle or suc cumbed to the ravages of disease in the Philippines, China, Guam and Honolulu. That is the fruit of imperi alism, and more is to follow. That Is the penalty for repudiating the Dec laration of Independence. Though President McKinley's recent message to Congress contained some 22,000 words, thus marking the "no plus ultra" of presidential prolixity, not a reference was made to his puis sant ally, the dusky Sultan of Sulu. Wliat has become of that Mohamme dan monarch since he left for China, and is polygamy yet practiced in his dominions under the protection of the Stars and Stripes? Surely, Mac could give one paragraph, at least, to the Mormon ruler of the Orient. Before Congress adjourns, Hon. C. A. Towne may deliver an eulogy on the late Senator Davis. Both Davis and Towne received their diplomas in Ann Arbor University, Mich., and that institution is proud of being their alma mater. "Charley" Towne is em inently qualified to pronounce the ora tion in honor of the departed states man. He is a man with a wonderful command of language and Is the equal of any member of the Senate as an orator and a scholar. Says the San Francisco Monitor: There Is no pause in the work of so cial and moral regeneration in Manila. An outbound steamer from this coast last week Included among other freight fifty thousand barrels of American beer, consigned to dealers in the Phil ippine metropolis. If "wet goods" pro mote civilization among Inferior brown folk, there 1b no matter of doubt as to the ultimate uplifting of the natives who escape the persuasion of the Krag-Jorgeneon. Emperor William of Germany has issued a decree in reference to stmt leg In the higher schools in which be gives English a preference over French, making the former an obllga. tory study and the latter an optional one. The Empress of India and the Bmpeior of the Philippines must feel gratified at the recognition of the An glo-Saxo£ tongue by the Kaiser of the "Vaterland." English is more widely spoken to-day than any other lan guage. and William is wise In giving it first place In the higher schools of his empire. The late Sir Arthur Sullivan was said to have Jewish blood in his veins, but he had none. His mother was an Italian named Righi, and his father was pure Irish. His grandfather was an impoverished Kerry squire who served under Wellington and was a member of the garrison at St. Helena. Whether he was an apostate from the Catholic faith of his ancestors we are not aware, but Sir Arthur Sullivan was buried according to the rites of the Church of England. Bishop Sidney C. Partridge, of tlu Protestant Episcopal church, says In an interview in the Pittsburg Post: "The greatest change of all in this country is that when I left it eight years ago I left a republic. 1 came back to an empire. This has made the greatest difference in the world in the way the people iu the East look at the I'niteil States. Always heretofore the United States lias stood to those coun tries as the great exception, the one great free government. Now she is looked upon in the same light as the empires of Europe." That is because of the imperial policy of William Me Kinley and his adherents. The Rev. Hugh O. Pentecost, of New York, takes no stock in the vice cru sade inaugurated by Bishop Potter in that city, in a discourse last Sunday lie said: "As to stamping out vice Bishop Potter knows it can't be done. The vice crusaders are simply hum bugs aud don't know it. They don't wain the city cleansed. If they real ly thought New York was to be .purl lied they'd be more scared than the divekcepers. I mean our silk stock ings, our respectable Fifth avenue cit izens, who attend Bishop Potter's and Dr. Hall's church. These are the poor est citizens we have, the most willing to violate laws, the least patriotic." Pentecost is right. The same can be truly said of the "silk stockings" in every largo city of the land. They want no purification in morals, and it is they who patronize the gilded dens of iniquity. They are simply hypo crites when they organize a crusade to suppress them. A 

HIGHLY HONORED PRIEST. The tragic death of Very Rev. John E. Barry. V. »., of Concord, N. II., brought poignant grief to his fellow citizens of every religious denomina tion. When the news reached the city that he was killed by a street car in New York the sorrow manifested by all classes and denominations was re markable. On the day of his funeral all business was suspended and 2,000 Protestants passed the body of the dead priest as it reposed in state on a catafalque in the Catholic Church. Governor Itollins and wife, the mayor of the city aud meinliers of the council, together with all the pastors of the city churches, attended the obsequies. In every Protestant church in Concord mention was made of Father Barry and prayers were offered in some of them for tlie repose of his soul. Ad dresses were delivered by the ministers extolling the virtues of the Catholic priest. Special prayers were offered for him iu the Episcopal church, and memorial services were held in the Unitarian church. Hon. James O. Ly ford, a naval officer, paid an eloquent tribute to the memory of Father Bai ry, and resolutions of condolence were passed by the congregation and or dered spread ii(on the records of the church. lit. Rev. William Woodruff Miles, the Episcopal bishop of New Hamp shire, referred to Father Barry in his annual address as follows: "Since the earlier paragraphs of this address were written, a word has come to Concord which more than any thing I have known before, has bowed down this whole community with grief. And I can not find it in my heart to pass it by without any men tion here in this Christian assemblage. I mean the death, by a shocking acci dent, in the dreadful streets of New York, to our dear Father Barry, vicar general of the diocese of Manchester, and pastor of St. John's church in this city. It is not possible, nor perhaps would it be fitting here to utter forth all that is in my heart. This I must set down: I have never known a minister of our Lord Jesus Christ whose life more beautifully and more consistently showed forth the life ami the spirit of the Lord and Saviour, than Father John Barry's. In meek ness, In diligence. In care for all best things in this city, in a loyal, steady adherence to his own convictions aad to the laws and the order of his own Church, tills charitable, faithful, god ly man was during more than oue thlrd of a century a beacon light here In Concord to cheer, and strengthen and help every right-minded man. A public-spirited citizen, a compassion ate, loving neighbor, a Christian gen tleman, a good priest—what more need one say? Even outside of his own flock no other death could have brought sorrow into so many homes. May he rest iu peace. 'The Lord grant him mercy in that Day!' Who could imagine that the Episco pal bishop of New Hampshire, where Blue Laws against members of the Catholic church were enforced until recently, would pay such a loving trib ute to a priest of the Church of Rome? It Is gratifying to find that religious prejudices are vanishing in New Eng land, and that men of different beliefs can entertain respect for the honest convictions of their neighbors. Per haps in no other country than Ameri ca could such a demonstration of sad ness be witnesssed as that in the city of Concord. The entire people realized that a good man and a good citizen had met an untimely death and their hearts were deeply touched. They had watched the career of Father Bar ry in their midst for a whole genera tion and properly estimated the work he had accomplished. The ill-fated priest must have exercised great influ ence in the community to have elicit ed such manifestations of grief at his departure from earth. He must have been a man of amiable qualities, for it is rarely that the death of any cit izen, lay or clerical, brings forth such universal expressions of public sor row. No longer can it be said that the people of New Hampshire are imbued with sectarian prejudices. A PARLIAMENT IN COLLEGE GREEN. Last Tuesday an aggregate assem bly of delegates from all parts of Ire land, including seventy-five members of parliament who absented them selves from Westminster, met in Dub lin to discuss matters pertaining to their native land. It was a national convention in every sense of the word, and judging from the meagre de spatches to American papers its pro ceedings were watched with consider able interest by the British press. John Redmond, the Irish parliament ary leader, opened the meeting and presided thereat. The Rotunda was filled to its utmost capacity by sev eral thousand delegates representing county councils, borough corporations, district councils, branches of the Unit ed Irish league and kindred bodies, and Mr. Redmond was right in calling the assemblage "the parliament of the Irish people." One celebrated Irishman was not present—Timothy M. I-Iealy, M. r. and Q. C. In detiiance of William O'Brien he went over to London and partici pated in the work of the British par liament. 1-Ie may regret his temerity in defying the will of the Irish Nation alists, for by a resolution introduced by William O'Brien the doughty Tim was excluded from the councils of the Irish parliamentary party. The fact that out of thousands of delegates only twenty-five voted against the resolu tion shows that William O'Brien wields a tremendous influence in Irish national affairs. The London Daily News recognizes his standing'with his countrymen and refers to him as "a generous, single minded enthusiast, of whose fervent patriotism there can be uo doubt." The British paper is sharp enough to see that William O'Brien is an unsel fish Irishman whose sole object in pub lic life is to elevate his country to the rank of a free nation, and that he is willing to make any personal sacrifice to attain that end. He is altogether a different man from Healy, who has been a disruptlonist for the past ten years and is apt to remain so until lie wears the ermine like Peter O'Brien. A man like Healy deserves not the confidence of his countrymen any long er, and it is well that the representa tives of Ireland in national convention assembled have administered to iiisn a rebuke which may bring him to his senses or compel him to join the ene my openly and receive his reward for his betrayal. It is useless for Tim othy Harrington to espouse the cause of Ilealy in the face of the action of the national convention, and if he con tinues as his advocate he may meet the same fate as his unruly client. It is high time that peace and unity exist among the Irish leaders. The recent elections demonstrated that the Ilealyites had lost their grip, and like sensible men they should bow to the voice of the majority. Ilealy himself could accomplish great good by co-operating with the Irish party, but he won't do it. and consequently he deserves to be excluded from its councils for his recalcitrancy. For some unaccountable reason Healy has been endorsed in his course by I he Catholic clergy, and one of them at. the convention tried to save him from the humiliation iu store for him by proposing an amendment to O'Brien's resolution which was rejected over whelmingly. Resolutions of sympathy for the Boers were adopted unanimously at the Dublin convention, and the same were ordered to lie cabled to the president of the Africander Bund. After an ad dress by John Dillon on the cruelty of the Boer war, the assembly broke forth into tierce cries and protests against the British government. THE 

PAPAL SOVEREIGNTY. The Minneapolis Journal, in an ar ticle entitled "Ireland on the Pope," says "It is remarkable that such a pro fessedly modern prelate as Archbishop Ireland should appear as a champion of a policy repudiated by a progressive age," because, forsooth, he advocates the independence of the Pontiff from the interference of civil rulers and predicts that "the Italian people and Christendom at large will give back to the papacy its wonted dignity and lib erty." Our esteemed contemporary thinks that the Pope now enjoys all the free dom necessary for the exercise of his spiritual functions and that Rome is destined to remain the capital of the Italian nation, "because it is histori cally and traditionally the seat of king ly and imperial power," and because "no other locality could be taken for such purpose." And pray, why not? Was not Milan once the capital of Italy, and why can't it be the capital again? Who has made Rome the magnificent city it is—the Popes or the kings and em perors? "Were it not for the Roman Pontiffs," says Dr. Moynihan in the eurrrent number of the Catholic World. "Rome would have shared the fate of Memphis and Babylon: it would be a nameless and shapeless heap of ruins In a wilderness swept by pestilence." For over a thousand THE IRISH STANDARD, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 15, 19(10. years the Popes held temporal sway in the Eternal City and made it what it is to-day—the Mecca of the civil ized races of the world. Did the Pope leave Rome and carry off the treasures of ages which it contains, what would be left to attract visitors beyond the great temples, the catacombs, and the pagan ruins? The aged occupant of the Vatican is the magnet that draws people to Rome and makes the city famous. "The Pope to-day," continues the Journal," is absolutely independent in the exercise of his spiritual functions." It then adds hat the Italian parlia ment enacted the law of papal guaran tees, setting apart a large fund for his use, protecting liim in the exercise of his sacred office, and granting him the possession of the Vatican and a line country residence iu the vicinity of Rome. All that is true, and yet the Pope is treated more as- a subject by the Ital ian king than an independent ruler of 250,000,000 people who recognize him as the vicegerent of Christ upon earth. The young king of Italy objected to the Pope as a member of the Hague peace conference when he was pro posed by the Czar of Russia. Why did he do so? Merely to show that he was a subject nf the Italian monarchy. The day may come, and that ere long, when Victor Emmanuel III may exer cise a censorship over papal encycli cals and interfere with the Pope in the discharge of his functions as the head of the universal church. In relation 10 the guarantees refer red to by our esteemed contemporary we will quote the following from Dr. Moynihan's able article on the tem poral power ol' the Pope in the Catho lic World for this month: "The law of guarantees is nothing more than a sop thrown to the con science of Christendom if proof of this be needed, it may be found in that utter contempt for the spirit of the guarantees which the government has steadily manifested. A penal code has been enacted which the Eng lish press characterized as 'a challenge to the Italian clergy to choose between God and Caesar.' Funds bequeathed by the piety of generations of the church have been withdrawn from ecclesiastical control, and this at the bidding of a man who had preached an open propaganda of infidelity against Christianity in the towns aud villages of Italy. A funeral proces sion wlricli in the stillness of the night was escorting to their last resting place the remains of the venerable predecessor of Leo was set upon by gangs of ruffians who, taking advan tage of the reign of license and vio lence tolerated in Rome, fought t.o throw the dead body of the Pontiff into the Tiber. And how far the Italian government goes in its perse cution of the Pope may be inferred from the fact that a mayor of Rome has been dismissed by the ministry for a simple expression of good will towards the Sovereign Pontiff, and that the Holy See, which possesses more moral force than all the rulers of Europe combined, has been exclud ed by the machinations of the Quir inal from the greatest peace congress of the age. These are but the most flagrant instances of the ceaseless warfare waged against the Pope by those who point to the law of guaran tees as a security of the Pontiff's inde pendence. Truly the modern Magna Charta of the papacy guarantees noth ing. Even if Leo were willing to barter the patrimony of Peter for Italian lire lie would not be safe against the infringement of his most elementary rights. The very exis tence of the law of guarantees is a presumption that the Pope is a subject. The Pope, if any man, must be his own master, and his own master he cannot be if lie becomes the pensioner of a secular government, with rights safeguarded only by an act of parlia ment." The Journal will see that there are two sides to the papal question, and on rcllection it may agree with Arch bishop Ireland that "at a period not so remote the Italian people and Christendom at large will give back to the papacy its wonted dignity and liberty." When a few years ago the Italian troops were slaughtered and captured by Menelek of Abyssinia, that dusky monarch readily granted the request of the Pope and let Hum bert's soldiers return to Italy. Sup pose Menelek held them until the Pope obtained his temporal possessions and that other Catholic monarchs joined him in behalf of the Pope's independ ent sovereignty, what could the Ital ian king do but succumb to the in evitable? We believe that the gigantic wrong done to the papacy In the name of "liberty and Italian unity" will be righted by international negotation early in the coming century, and that no living prelate of Christendom can do more to bring it about than the re nowned Archbishop of St. Paul. THE SOUTH AFRICAN SITUATION. Despite the drastic measures adopt ed by Kitchener to compel the uncondi tional surrender of the Boers, the war iu South Africa still goes merrily on. Gen. De Wet,, the Marion of the Or ange Free State, is more than a match for all the British generals combined. A few days ago it was reported that he was surrounded on all sides and that cscape was impossible but after a chase of ten days by Gen. Knox the wily De Wet got away safely, to be heard from again when least expected. The big British generals, including Buller. Methuen, Cleary. White and Baden-Powell, have returned home and Lord Roberts Is now following them to England. The man rrv:'-.'W left behind to carry on the campaign is Lord Kitchener, the butcher of Omdurman, but outside of burning the homes of the people and driving the women and children off the farms into the towns, he has not yet distinguished himself, and is not likely to succeed where Roberts failed with a force of 270,000 to 30,000, or 9 against 1. Kitchener Is the very incarnation of cruelty, but if he carries things too far there may be a terrible retalia tion. Of the 1,500,000 whites in Brit ish South Africa, all but 100,000 are Boer sympathizers, and their hatred of the English has been aroused to the fever point by the outrages perpetrat ed by Kitchener's soldiers. The Anglo Irish commander is a ruthless warrior, before whom Weyler sinks into insig nificance. Tomorrow is the sixty-second anni versary of Dingaan's Day, and it will be celebrated by the farmers of the Transvaal and Orange Free State, as best they can, under very unfavorable conditions. On Dec. 10, 1S3S, their fathers, to the number of 600, defeated 15,000 Zulus in other words, the Zu lus, though twenty-five to one, were routed by the brave Boers. The de scendants of such sires are not afraid of Kitchener and his British savages. Writing on this subject the Dublin Freeman's Journal says: Lord Kitchener's claim to military leadership in South Africa is based on his defeat of the Dervishes at Ivhar toom. On that occasion, according to English accounts, the strength of the Khalifa's forces was 50,000. It was a great host, but its armament—spears and assegais—were hundreds of years behind the times. Opposed to it Lord Kitchener had 25.000 trained soldiers, furnished with the most modern weap ons, and supported by the most deadly field guns. It was an unequal combat, and in the end became a mere battue yet for a time the issue was in-doubt, and had it not been for Colonel Hec tor Macdonald and his Soudanese Reg iment, it might easily have resulted very differently. We recall this so called battle in order to point the con trast between it and that which took place between the Zulus and the Bo ers. On the lGtli of December, 1638, as we have said, the Zulus were 15, 000 the Boers were only 600. That Is to say, the Zulus were twenty-five to one. At Omdurman the Dervishes were only two to one. On the former occasion the white man had nothing to help him but antiquated rifles on the latter he commanded the very best modern implements of war. The con trast between these two incidents is worth noting, as the "Hero of Omdur man" enters on Ids task of annihilat ing the sons and grandsons of the real heroes, whose names are enshrined in the memories of Dingaan's Day In ev ery Dutch household in South Africa. Is it conceivable that the cheap victor, who, through his glasses, watched the Baggara being killed by the hundred by his Maxims, is any match in the warfare of the Veldt with the descend ants of the six hundred farmers who, from sunrise to sunset, kept Dingaan's fifteen thousand braves at bay, and as day closed, sent them, defeated and demoralized, flying north to Swazi land? There was no peerage for the man who did that mighty deed, but the deed lives in the hearts of the Boer people, and nerves them to-day in their commandoes on the mountains. Lord Kitchener is to get a "free hand." But the-Boers have a free hand also. If Lord Kitchener attempts to intro duce savage warfare fairly aud squarely without any technicalities, he may be sure that the Boers, not withstanding their desire to see this business through on civilized lines, will retaliate. They are extremely handy men, these Boers, at taking British prisoners. Unfortunately, owing to their present situation, they have no place to put these prisoners, and for the most part have to release them after a time. If Lord Kitchener en ters on the "free hand" campaign with which he is credited by the London Press, the Boers may think them selves justified in treating their British prisoners in a much more summary way. The "free hand," two sides to it! in fact, has A despatch from Johannesburg, now occupied by the British, says that the Boers recently captured 17,000 sheep belonging to the enemy. That will keep them in mutton for some time. That "the wages of sin is death" was sadly illustrated in the case of Oscar Wilde, the gifted son of gifted Irish parents. On his death bed he blamed his father for opposing his en trance into the Catholic Church when a young man. He was fortunate to have a priest to prepare him for eter nity. It is a remarkable fact that with an estimated total of 15,500,000 voters thto year as against 14,250,000 four years ago, fewer votes were cast for presi dent in 1900 than in 1896. In 1900 there were cast 13,883,943 votes for president, and In 1896 the presidential vote was 13,923,378. The Independent voters were disgusted and remained away from the polls. Winston Spencer Churchill is on a lecture tour iu America instead of at tending to his parliamentary duties at Westminster. He wants some Yankee dollars, and, of course, he will get them. He is the son of the late Lord Randolph Churchill and Jennie Jer ome. of New York, now Mrs. Cornwal lis West Young Churchill speaks highly of the Boers as fighters. He was their prisoner for awhile, but made bis escape from captivity. Major John McBride, late of the Boer army, arrived on the steamer La Bretagne in New York last Sunday night. He was commander of the Irish brigade, speaks enthusiastically of the Boer cause, and is of the opin ion that the Dutch farmers will even tually win in spite of recent reverses. Major McBride is 35 years of age and a native of Westport, Mayo. He was intended for the medical profession, but after several years' study entered a wholesale chemical establishment in Dublin where he remained till the out break of the war iu South Africa. He will make a lecture tour in the United States. A man has at last bobbed up wuo does not want his left hand to know what his right hand does. Strange to say, he is a resident of the Windy City. He has been acting the philan thropist for some time without disclos ng his name, and now he publicly asks the newspapers not to ferret him out for notoriety. "For simply doing mj duty I wish no thanks and I expect none," he says. If his request be not granted he threatens to stop his do nations in behalf of suffering humani ty. He is evidently a man who does good by stealth and who would blush to find it fame. By all means, let his identity be kept a secret by the Chiea ga reporters. Richard Harding Davis, the intrep id war correspondent, is being severely criticized by the London papers for ex posing the misconduct of imprisoned British officers in Pretoria. The Brit ish officials iu South Africa induced "a representative body of women ot various nationalities, resident at Pre toria throughout the war" to repudi ate Mr. Davis' charges in the London Times. The letter signed by those wo men is just as authentic as the peti tion addressed to the queen by the Outlanders at Johannesburg before the war. It only shows that the British are sensitive to the criticism of an in dependent American journalist who is not afraid to tell the truth. Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister to the United States, lectured before a Gotham society last Sunday and com pared the teachings of Confucius with those of Christ. Taking up the New Testament he read from it the words, "Love your enemies," and said: "Such a standard of excellence is too high for humanity. There is no likelihood that many people will follow it. At this moment Christian missionaries are calling for bloodshed and ven geance, and Christian armies are dev astating the land, sparing neither age nor sex. There is indeed a vast gulf between doctrine and performance." What a rebuke from a heathen to the Anglo-Saxon civilizers who are de stroying the homes of the freedom-lov ing people of South Africa and the Philippines. What unmitigated trash is the fol lowing from President McKinley's long winded message: "I have upon another occasion called the Filipinos 'the wards of the nation.' Our obligation as guardian was not lightly assumed it must not be otherwise than honest ly fulfilled, aiming, first of all, to be nefit those who have come under our fostering care. It is our duty so to treat them that our flag may be no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon and the fertile zones of Mindanao and Ne gros than it is at home that there as here, it shall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlightenment and progress in every avenue of development." In the Neely extradition case before the United States Supreme Court at Washington, the attorney for the def endant argued that McKinley has no right to govern Cuba, and that a milit ary government in that island is with out autliorty under international law and in violation of the Constitution of the United States. He declared that the control of Cuba by the President as commander-in-chief is a virtual pro secution of war without the authority of Congress, which declared on April 20, 1898, that the people of the island of Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free and independent. The other day in the British parlia ment Balfour, the government leader, justified the burning of farms and oth er severities practiced by Kitchener in South Africa by reading the United States official regulations for the guid ance of the American troops in guerilla warfare in the Philippines. In reply to a query from Tim Healy, Balfour said they were dated 1899, whereupon Healy retorted: "They were framed after America got Into the same stew as England is in South Africa." Some there are who seem to be im mensely pleased at the grotesque spectacle of Charles A. Towne rattling around in C. K. Davis' shoes. Now it would be just as funny to see these same individuals rattling around in Charles A. Towne's shoes. There are degrees of greatness you know.—St. Paul Globe. Quite true. It would be funny to see Joseph A. Wheelock or George Thompson rattling around the corridors of the national capitol to act as a substitute for either Davis or Towne. The dashing editor of the Minneap olis .Times rarely uses the pronoun "we" In his double-column utterances. He uses The Times instead. For ex ample: "The Times favors any good Minneapolitan who cnu be elected. Time and event will show and The Times is content to rest for a time." etc., etc. Our esteemed friend of The Times is up to the times and is getting out a lively paper all the time. Suc cess to The Times! F. P. Dunne, the Chicago humorist, is recovering from a severe attack of typhoid fever. Everyone will be glad to learn of the convalescence of "Mr. Dooley." Joe Wheelock says in the Pioneffr Press that Charles A. Towne will en joy the distinction of having been senator for a shorter period than any one in the history of the republic. If report be triiQ, Joe himself was quite anxious to go iu place of the Duluth statesman. A dispatch from London says that Yankee thieves are operating in the modern Babylon and display remarka ble dexterity iu their profession. They must be exceptionally clever if they can beat the cockney pickpockets who ply their trade in this country and ou the European continent. The Irish Standard tenders its sym pathy to the firm of John O'Callahan Sons, of Philadelphia, upon the de mise of Henry Augustine, sou of Elis abeth and the late John O'Callahan, who departed this life ou Dec. 3 in the 24th year of his age. Hay his soul rest in peace. Governor John Liml in a public in terview says that ICnute Nelson se cured his election to the United States senate by "subterfuge and deceit." W. 1). Washburn will testify to the allegation. After mature reflection the Irish Standard unhesitatingly asserts that "the little Norwegian" is as crook ed as a ram's horn. Hearst's Chicago American of last Monday contained a one-page article by William J. Bryan in which he says: "I have no intention of giving up the fight for the principles I have been ad vocating. Whether I am ever a can didate for office again is immaterial, but I shall continue to speak and write as in the past." Hon. Moses E. Clapp, ex-attorney general, has announced his candidacy for the U. S. Senate. He is a worthy man who would make a fitting suc cessor of Cushman K. Davis in point of ability. He is opposed by the St. Paul Dispatch because he expressed sympathy with the Boers in the South African war. William Ludwig, Ireland's greatest baritone singer, will appear in grand concert at the Lyceum theater in Min neapolis next Monday night. Lovers of music throughout the Northwest have a rare chance to enjoy something rich in Ludwig's singing, which is worth a journey of many miles to hear. Mr. Ludwig, who is an Irishman born, was in Minneapolis about ten years ago and sang to an immense audience As James J. Hill is going to retire from the presidency of the Great Northern why not send him to the United States senate to occupy the seat of C. K. Davis? It may be said that he is a Democrat and no states man. He is a Democrat in name only, and in statesmanship he is the superior of Mark Iianna and Cliauncey M. De pew. No better or abler man than Jim Hill could be selected to represent Minnesota in the upper house of con gress during an imperialistic adminis tration. What It to Be a Catholic. The following definition of the duties and beauties of Catholicity may be studied with advantage by all who profess that ennobling faith. In an eloquent discourse delivered by Father Tiernan of Cincinnati, at the annual convention of the Catholic Knights of Ohio, he asks and eloquently answers the question, "What is it to be a Cath olic?" Our readers may well ask them selves this pertinent question, and then answer by ascertaining whether their own lives measure up to the standard of the ideal Catholic, as described by Father Tiernan, as follows: "Now, I ask, what is it to be a Cath olic? Go read the answer in the lives of the men and women who for 1900 years have trod the ways of heroic virtue in the footsteps of the Crucified. Go study it in the calm and peaceful heroism of the early Christian martyr, who laughed at the threats of tyrants, and prayed for his enemies as his life went out beneath the horrors of the tortures which he bore with joy rather than betray his God. Seek it up and down the ages, in every rank and sta tion, from the monarch on the throne to the peasant in the field. Seek it in the hearts of nature's noble men and women, where it shines with a beauty and a lustre all its own and elevates their hearts above the ties of kindred and of country, even to the Eternal God Himself—the center of the source of true Catholicity. Seek it and find it in the supernatural lives of men and women living to-day, liv ing not alone in cloistered solitude, not alone at the foot of God's altar in constant adoration, not alone in priest ly robes, but even in the busy world of noise and wild distraction, In the marts of trade and in domestic cares, where the lots of most of you are cast. What is it to be a Catholic? It is to rest secure in the possession of eternal truth, in the certainty of being right, in the priceless privilege of not being blown about by every wind of doc trine. It is to live with the sunshine of divine hope warming the human soul. To be a Catholic is to love God above all things and your neighbor as yourself. It is to live in a disposition, at least, of the highest charity char ity that stops not at mere theory, not a mere speculation or profession, but that works itself out in acting—high, noble, God-like acting. This it is to be a Catholic. Faith, hope and char ily, these are as faculties of to a Catholic. •f—S "V1 hiB soul
