THE INDIANAPOLiS JOURNAL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1889. apt expression even hint that there Is any requirement in the act that such lawks shall bo explosively used In the schools. But I am not aure that provision for the exclusive use of the books to be secured xuay not be properly enouch connected vith the subject expresl that, if found In the body of the act. It should be Jidd to be valid. I am much -lu-Jlncd to thick o. for reasons which need not be stated. But if this be the subject of doubt. still any such provision should, according to ail authority, be upheld. Buch respect in due to the Ltirifdatnre that even the court oilat report may not, upon a doubt, hoM an act of the Lcrilaturo to be void. We mast then look to tbe body of the act itself, and. If ne i'd be, construe it. The act i remedial. The mischief wan not. I think, thathc-re was not uniformity of text-bookH iu u-e throughout the whole tttatc. Hueh uniformity in a single school ras, I suppose, generally tit eniM essential to Ten a tolerable ettietency of the fchwlquite de sirable if secured throughout a township, and appreciably so if it covered a whole county, but It 14 not recalled as n part of the hUtoryof the times that it was recojiniT.td as a mischief, tnat control of the matter had lx-n eonmied to each county, city, town, or township acting through Its local officers, and independently of all other counties, cities and tov. ua. '1 hero was in short. no recognized iui.cbiof. In rtu.edy of which It. was necessary to deprive the local authorities of the power which they had ol drtrnniuinjc the text- book which xnnt ls used within their wveral Jurisdictions. We are not required, theretore, to regard thia statute a intended to remedy that as a mischief, and put such a construction upon It as will prevent it. What, tlieu, uas tlie mischief: The eorcmpor. aneous hitory is almost of to-day. The act it self discloses a part of it. Certain text-books were ia general uo" po the act declares (Sec. 1) and the ffritdaturo deemed them entirely atlfaotory. for it names them aud makes them the standard of excellence, to which the books to bo secured by virtue of the act mast conform. They mitrht have leen the very books thus secured under the act, if their publishers had offered to furnish them at the prices limited by the act. Bnt the then extetiue prices that Is the mischief which it Is notorious -confronted the Legislature aud oppressed the people of the Htate. These books. It was charped and believed, were not even sold at the same prices through cut the State, and further, that the publisher thereof were in combination with publishers of other and rival series of text-books, by which competition was prevented and exorbitant price maintained snd exacted. It is cer tain that this mischief would bo amply remedied by any enactment which would eeeuro a proper reduction of the prices of the books then In general use, orbriujc within reacn of the peoplo other books of equal excellence, at satisfactory prices. Now, to ac complish this, the act, amongst other things, requires the btate Board of Education, by exten sive advertisement, to invite sealed bids from publishers for furnihinjc text-books for use in tho public schools lor the period of live years, such bids to be accompanied by specimen sam ples of the books offered and the prices demanded lor each. Then the board Is required to examine, the specimens. Ho bid ean be accepted for any book unless the specimen accompanying It is ad Judged to be of equal merit with the correspond ing book of the series named as being then in general use. Of bids thus eligible, the lowest is to be accepted, the merit of the boot considered, provided it does not exceed a price which is ttxed as a maximum by the act iUelf. A bid belns accepted, then a contract is to be A made with the bidder, binding him to furnish the book, or books, -to be sold to patrons" of public schools, for use therein, at tlur prices named in the bid. The State is not to become the furchaser of any book, but by its school officers l is to sell the books to the people for use in tho public schools. The. school trustees are to sell for cash, and the proceeds are to be returned ouarterlv to tho contractor. Notice of the uuan- tity needed for use in the several school corpora tions is to be given by the trustees thereof by requisition through' the county superintendent, ana the contractor is required to deliver the re quired books to the latter officer, from whom the trustees are required to obtain them for eale. Thus tho contractor is to be relieved of the ex Iense of distribution to purchasers, and making sales and collections, a device certainly well adapted, as was intended, to secure the lowest possible prices. So far it is not ex pressly required that these books shall bo exclusively used in the schools, nor can that requirement be fairly implied. It is one thing to eecure good books at low prices, arid quite a Oil-, fereut thinj to compel their exclusive use in le schools. It is probable, however, that the con sideration of low prices would, in the end, by its own force secure the universal adoption of these books throughout the State in the absence of any statute or authority compelling it. But it c:iu hardly be doubted that it was within the power of the Legislature to adopt these books to the exclusion of all others. At any rate, I think of insufficient reason for denying that power. If this power, as to a county, could be conferred uion the county board of education, I know not why tho Legislature cannot itself exr rchse the auie power as to the public schools of tho whole htate. or confer it upon the State Board of Edu cation. There are. nowever, other portions of the act not yet reviewed which are supposed to affect the question In hand, and these must bo examined. The first section of the act invests the State Board of Education with authority lu this lan guage: "For the purpose of making a selection or procuring the compilation, for me in the com mon schools of the btate, of a series of text books in the following branches of study It then names the studies and fixes the standard of merit of the books, as already stated. This sec tion does not. in term,make the powerof selec tion dependeut upon the acceptance or tender of any bid for the furnishing or compilation of books. Considered apart from the other provis ions of the act. if this language, by its own force, makes it obligatory upon the local school officers to put in use In the schools the books selected for use in the schools" by the State board, and to exclude other books, then it does, without doubt, repeal, by implication, the former lawn which gave control of the matter to local school officers. The words, "make a selection of text books) for use in the public schools of the State," are not quite as exact an expression of the idea the English language is capable of furnishing. "Books which shall be used in the public . schools," would be more definite. Or 'books suit able for use" would have forbidden the conclu sion that it was intended to compel the use of the books so to be selected. A merchant also selects goods for use by his customers, but this does not necessarily imply that his customers will or fchall purchase or use them. But this section may not be construed a part from its context. Nobody so contends, nor would it be claimed that, unconditionally. It fcivestothe Ftate board authority to prescribe the books which shall be used, if no contract for their supply had teen made. The whole act must be considered in construing any part of it which needs construction, in order that Incon sistencies therein may be avoided, and all its parts be made to harmonize with each other. It eeems to me that the last proviso to Section 7 ' has an Important bearing upon this question. This is its language: "Nothing in this act shall operate to prevent the Btate Board of Educa tion, boards of school trustees or boards of school commissioners from deviling means " for the sale, exchange or other disposition of euch tiooks as may be owned by the pupils of the schools under their charge at the time of the adoption of books under the provisions of this act.1. This is in terms a canon of construction for the whole act. The local boards are not to be. by nnything in the act, prevented from making terms for exchanging old books iu use, when new ones shall be adopted, for the new ones. But if such officers or boards have, by force of the act, lost their former power to adopt books, and the new ones have been adopted by reason of the fact that the btate board has contractedeo ns to secure them, then the local authorities are not free to make terms for exchange of books they must take the new books nolens volens, and, if they would exchange at all, it must be upon such terms as the con tractors choose to prescribe. But If the wer to adopt tho new books still be oiigstothe local officers, then they are at lib erty to negotiate fbrthe exchange npon favor able terms" as a condition upon which they will ndopt the new books, and in this view this pro viso incomes a substantial protection to tho tH'ople, and not a mere string of verbiage wholly inefficient for any useful purpose. Now it seems to nie that Section 1,. above quoted, is iu perfect harmony with this proviso thus interpreted, that the "selection" of bopks, which the .State toard i authorized to make, bus reference whol ly to the duty imposed upon it by Section 3, which requires it to examine the specimen books snbndtted bv bidders, with a view to ascertain ing whether "they reach the standard of merit pre eriled in the first section, and then from among such as are selected as being up that standard to contract for such as are ottered at the lowest price, not above the maximum fixed by the act, merit being also considered. v Thus construed no violence is done to tho lan jruage of any part of the statute, every part and clause of it is given substantial and beneficial effect, in harmony w ith every other pan. and a remedy for the out mischief is fully attained. This Is in harmony also with the immemorial policvof our Hate, i hich. as far as may be found con Tenient, confers uion local and municipal au thorities the control, in administration, or looal concerns. The wisdom of this uoliey in general has, so far as I know, never -?n controverted In Indiana, and without now-calling in question thepowerof .the Legislature to change it, asto the matter of public school. I do not think the courts can be Justified in assuming that legisla tion was intended to infringe upon it. unless the lauguage employed, and a mischief existing and attempted 'to bo enrru. Indicate clearly nnd af firmatively that with a result was really in tended. If it were conceded that the language of the . statute is equally susceptible of a construction which woidd make the use of the new books in dr schools compulsorywhich I do not think tne result would be the same. Nothing is better settled by all authority than that in that cae the Interpretation mut lie adopted which will bring the new statute into agreement with the old one. avoid repeal by implication, and give effect to the principle that repeal by implication shall not te favored. It follows as a conclusion that the fifth para praph of the return is good arpon demurrer. If other look had been adopted and in use in tho schools of the township, with tho approval of tha defendant, tho statute does Xiot require him to suieiede them. The new book: could not at present be used in the schools of the township, and, inasmuch as the duty or the defendant is only to provide them "for use in the school," he has not failed in it peiformancc.

TIIE FIRST DISTRICT CONTEST Grounds on Which Mr. Posey Disputes Mr. Parrett's Right to Sit in Congress. Evidence that Many Illegal Democratic Totes Were Can St 3Ieinrad Students Not Actual Residents of Spencer County. Efreelal to the Indianapolis Journal. Washington, Dec. 8. There is every evi dence now that Indiana's contested election case vf ill soon be determined by the House of Representatives. It is the purpose of Speaker Heed to very early designate a com mittee on elections, so that the various con teats from the several States may be taken up. looked into and reported to the House for action. Both the contestant and cou- testeo from the Evansville district are in the city, and both have submitted their briefs to the Clerk of the House, who will turn them over to the committee on elec tions, with the testimony taken. Some days ago a special to the Journal from this city gave tho pith of the defense "which Judge William F. Parrett, contestee, makes in reply to the testimony submitted by Judge Francis B. Poaey. the contestant It was to the eflect that the students at the St. Meinrad Catholic College, in Spencer county, had a right to vote, since Catholio students have a residence wherever they aro located, even though they are students. In answer to this Messrs. J. S. Buchanan and Cicero Buchanan, counsel for contest ant, say that the law, as announced by the Supreme Court, is that a student at a col lege may make the place of such school his home; that a man of lawful age may make any place he may desire his home; but it must be his home. He must select and des ignate it as such. No man can make a res idence except by his own choice. He must in his own mind determine the residence. Some other person cannot make it for him. This act of residence must be determined for himself after he is of age. If sent to school before he is of age, the fact that he remains at school after becoming of age will not of itself create a residence. All of the students of St. Meinrad school went there when minors and remained there after becoming of age, only because they had not graduated before. Intention to make a place a residence or home may be ascertained from the character of the per son and the place. I quote from the brief: "St. Meinrad is a village remoto from a railroad, with no industries, savo those, perhaps, of a blacksmith shop, country store and shoe-maker. These students were and are not mechanics: they were learning no trade. They were to be educated, and for no other purpose. The parents, rela tives or friends of neither of them live there. Their vacations arc all spent in some other place. None of them pay their own tuitiou. They do not work for their board and schooling, as is customary in Protestant colleges. They do not go to this school of their own volition, but were sent with the consent of parents or relatives by the bishop before they were of age. There is nothing in this village to induce any man of education to settle in and call it home no work, no life for them. "The fact that they were not -assessed for taxation or called on to work the roads shows conclusively that the town and county officers Tlid not consider them citi zens, and that any intention any of them might have had to make and call St. Meinrad their home had been so carefully guarded that the outside world their neighbors did not know it , "Indeed, these students taking their own evidence have no home, no citizenship; the) have no will or purpose; they are the creatures of another; their choice of home or lite they have surrendered. They aro sent to school by the bishop. Their school ing, board and clothing is paid for by the bi.shop. They must go or come as the bishop directs." Copious extracts from the testimony of students are incorporated in the brief, showing that the bishop of the church fixes -the place where students are to acquire their education, and they go wherever the bishop sends them. The students testified that their parents live at other places than the one where they voted, and that there had' Dee ti no special designation of St. Meinrad as their permanent residence. The law, of course, provides that there must be some demonstration that a man has made a place his permanent residence or intends to retain his location as his permanent resi dence before he is entitled to vote; that, be cannot vote at a mere temporary stopping place. After quoting from the testimony of the students at St Meinrad, the attor neys for the contestant say in argument: "The testimony of all the atudonts is sim ilar to that cited. They call St. Meinrad 'home,' simply because they live there, let they all state that they have no mind or in tention of their own. These students are much more under the control of tho bishop than Protestant children are under that of their father when they are at school. Would a Protestant son, sent by his father to college, the father paying his tuition, with right to say come and go, the son ac knowledging the authority of his father and his power to direct and control, make the college the residence of such son. even though he were of agel Most certainly not. The colleges of our country are full of men over the age of twenty-one who are sent by their parents, whose tuition is paid by their parents, yet who are not voters at such ocolicges. The fact that a man is of age docs not make him a citizen wherover ho may be. As long as the son acknowledges the authority and control of his father, that long is he unable to make a home dif ferent from that of the father. A man can not will his son a home in some other place. This the eon must do for himself.. So long as he is under the control, direction and will of his father, ho has none of his own.to exercise. In this case neither the sons rior their parents have any control. They have, surrendered all free action to tho bishop. The bittnop did not live at St. Meinrad, so his residence gives them no right to vote. "Isadoro Hobi was the priest and su perior in charge of this Catholic school. On election day he left his school and spent the entire time of the election ma room ad joining that occupied by the election board, livery person who voted had to pass before him, aud he was so seated that he could pee every one, that voted. This superior was a Democrat and voted that ticket. lie has charge of the spiritual and temporal welfare of these students. His interest in tho election was so great that he spent the entire day at the polls. One of these can didates for the priesthood, Joseph Weber, had charge of the tickets for the students. These students did not have time to work the roads, or pay taxes, or to perform any of the other duties of citizenship, yet one of them, under the eyes and direction of this superior, spends tho dav in distrib uting Democratic tickets. This superior, when on the witness-stand, was asked if he had not told Weber to do this, and an swered: T had no control.' The question was repeated three times and each time ho made tho same answer, I had no control.' The question was then asked, 'Did you not advise him to do it!' His answer was, T don't remember.' " The brief for the contestant shows that a number of Kentucky Democrats, thinking the Democratic majo'rity insufficient, loaned their votes to the border counties of Indi ana. The evidence discloses twenty-one of these illegal votes, fifteen of which wero uncontradicted by the contestee. Six of them, the contestee undertook to support. The evidence, though, is conclusive that these six were residents of Kentucky. Two of them. Thomas Hampton aud K. T.Con way, had made affidavits that they were residents of Kentucky at the time thej claim, in this contested case, to have been citizens of Indiana. Thomas and Harry Hampton had for years been citizens of Kentucky iarmed there. Sometimes in the winter, in high water, they would come over to the Indiana side. In March, Inks, the house their mother lived in burned down, and all they had. with their mother, was moved to Kentucky, and they never caiue buck. The following names are given as KentuckiaiiH who illegally voted for Parrett: Paul Cramer, J. A. Daniels. Frank Krouse, Sam Loan, Uichard Lummeii hanser. Jchn Oaks, John Kyan, Wallace Kailey, .1. M. Woolsey. Thomas Bruce, William Cooper, Thomas Hampton, liaxry Hampton, John Lynn, John Robinson, Ev M. Lucas. Jonathan- Todd, Colomon Gasso way, Thomas Crosnosor, John Coiner, 1 T. Conway. Contestant introduced evidence that five minors voted the Democratic ticket, and for contestee. The evidence as to these votes is statements made by the boys themselves, who said they were not of age, and testimony of neighbors who knew their ace. These illegal voters are Conrad W eaver, Sol Barlow, Shelton Ferris, John Kuark and William Tiltmore. At least two, and perhaps three, insane persons voted for contestee Joseph Khein lander. Al Niekens and Harmon Luckett. Al Nickens's father saysthat he hnd just re turned from the insane asvlum. If he was not crazy, he had no right to vote where he did, as his home was with his father, who had no right to vote at that precinct. Har mon Luckett lived in a cave, had a hollow log for a cupboard, and no home simple and worthless. If not, insane ne had no right to vote where he did, as his cave was in another precinct. Bass Thomas was 'so drunk that it took two men to hold him up, and he did not know what he was doing when he voted. In Mount Vernon there was much talk of tho Democrats buying the colored voters. Among these voters was a colored school-teacher by the name of William H. Taylor. He wanted his record clear, and ah an evidence of the fact, cu tho insula of his ticket ho wrote: "Voted bv W. H. Tay lor, teacher of colored school." This writ ing was no such marking as wonld destroy the vote. The statute provides that there shall be no distinguishing mark, but this has reference to the ticket in voting, and its intention is to protect the voter at the time of voting, and to prevent bribery and corruption in not allowing the briber to know what ticket is voted, and to prevent intimidation. lu Gibson county there wero two tickets, cast and counted that were marked tickets, and should have been rejected. They were both Democrat tickets, and were both punched in the border in such a manner as to be easily distinguished across the room. In Spencer county there were from eight to twelve marked tickets in one precinct. The facts in this case show bribery, and at tempts at bribery by the Democrats, and none by the Republicans. William Butler was bribed by Jasper Morris to vote tho Democratic ticket for 5 and a barrel of Hour. Butler admits that he voted, bnt does not say what ticket. Sief Anderson was paid $18 to vote the Democratic ticket His home was in Perry county, and he voted in Spencar. Henry Duncan, a col ored man, was paid $2 by Charles Sheldon, ft colored Democrat, to vote the Democratic ticket. Another man from Kentucky was paid fc-i to vote the Democratic ticket in Warrick county. In Posey county a Democratic saloon-keeper tried to get negroes to meet him, saying he had money to distribute. Whether ho succeeded is unknown, as the evidence was secured from a Democratic negro who would not tell. It is shown in evidence that there wore additional illegal votes cast to the number of thirty-seven and counted for tho con testee, Parrett. Of these thirty-seven votes the evidence is conclusive and un contradicted that nineteen of them were illegal. The names of tho parties casting these illegal votes were Louis Billings, Jas. Bacon, Robert Bollington, S. Coal. Paul Cramer, Benj. Darling, August Ernft, Thomas Ernst, Mathias Fanltner, Frank Ha3Tran, Win. Lanear, C. Mnyhall, - Sam Munday, Alexander Parker, Wm. Reed, J. Richart, Thomas Ross, Joseph Shell. The counsel for Judge Posey takes up seriatum the names of those who aro desig nated by contestee as illegal voters,' and disposes of each one so conclusively, in contradiction of the allegations, that the most obtuse mind can grasp the baseless ness of the defense. In conclusion. Judge Posey's attorneys recapitulate their ev idence as follows: The evidence of con testant shows that there were 103 illegal votes cast and counted for contestee. As to ninety of these votes, the evidence is-conclusive as to their illegality, as follows: St. Meinrad students, 23; Kentuckians, 21;' minors, 5; drunken voter, 1; inM.ne voters 2: rejected ballot, 1; marked tickets, 10; un contradicted illegal voters, 22. Conceding to contestee eight illegal votes by the ev idence, and the majority of t wenty declared for him on the face of the election returns, - this record shows that contestant was elected by more than sixty majority of the legal voters of the district." Those who have examined the brief of the counsel for Judge Posey say it isouo of tho most forceful expositions of any contested election case that they have ever 6een. It is comprehensive in every detail, answering. squarely and fairly, without any equivoc-j. tion or speculation, the charges of con testee. and clinches the statements "of evidence it makes so positively that it is unansweiable. Perry S. Heatil A NEW 

POWER IN POLITICS. i Railroad Employes, if Organized, Could Wield the Ilalance of Power. Frank Leslie's Weekly. . - The recent election in Iowa is not: so startling in its results now that the returns are all in. The only loss the Republicans sustained was that of their Governor, tho' Democratic candidate having about 6.000 plurality. The rest of the State officers and the Legislature are Republican. ' 1 The result in Iowa, however, dicloses a ; new phase in politics. It shows the strength of the railroad vote when massed for or against one candidate. It is general ly conceded that the railroad vote of Iowa was almost solidly cast for tho Democratic candidate for Governor, though, strangely enough, tho Republican candidate was opposed by many members of the. Fanners' Alliance because ho was supposed to be friendly to the railroad corporations. The railway employes , of the State, variously estimated at from 80,000 upwards, opposed tho Republican candidate for Governor because the present incumbent of that office. Governor Larra bee, has pursued a very narrow-minded policy in reference to the railways. He has made it so uncomfortable for them by seek ing to reduce their traffic rates, that the railways have been compelled to trim all expenditures, wages included, down to the closest point. Railroad employes who suf fered by this action could not revenge themselves upon the railway companies, because the latter themselves wero helpless to right the wrong, therefore the employes voted against the party held to be responsi ble for the losses they had sustained. Some time ago, on his return from Eu rope. Mr. Cbauncey M. Depew, whose every public utterance glistens with common sense, declared that if political conventions sought to array voters against a candidate Kimply because he was a railroad man tho 750,000 railway employes in the United States would resent this imputation at tho polls in a way that would not be forgotten. The sagacious mind of Mr. Depew foresaw what has apparently come to pass. It is Frobable that the railway employes of owa. remembering Mr. Depew's words, felt their true import and promptly took their revenge at the polls. It lookd verjr much like it. As a rule, the railroad employe is a man f superior intelligence. He meets travel ers from every part of the land; he is inter ested in public discussions; he is wide awake and observant, and generally well informed. Organized into a cohesive body, the railroad employes of this country could wield tho balance of power in almost ever' State election, and even in fed eral contests. Perhaps the politician who has been listening so Jong to the cry of the granger and the anti-monopolist, iinding himself confronted by this new and mighty power, will discover that he has made a mistake; but will he go as far to please the railroad employe as he has gone to please the anti-monopolist and the granger? We are living in a peculiar time. Party ties are resting very lightly on tho masses. The voter is more inclined now than he ever was before to vote for tho man of his choice rather than for tho ticket of his ratty. Whether the example set by the mugwumps lit the campaign of ISM has anything to do with existing conditions wo can only surmise, but it is apparent to every one that self-interest, more than de votion to party and party platforms, is tho moving cause with so large a number of voters nowadays that the calculations and , expectations of politicians are sometimes ' bitterly disappointed. Outlook for the Coming Man. Washington Post. At any rate it cannot be affirmed with truth that the women of America are indif ferent to the higher education, or that they are neglecting the better opportunities which have, of late year' been opened up to them. According to the statistics of the last educational year there were :a;.0t0 women, and 41.000 men in our regular col leges, and the nrospect is that in a few vears collegiate w omen will outnumber college bred men.

QUIET SUNDAY ENJOYED The President Went to Church and then Passes the Day with Relatives. How the Time Was Utilized by Other Memberi of the Party Departure for Chicago What the Administration Is Doing. President Harrison enjoyed a quiet Sun day. It was like the many he was ac customed to spend before he was called to the greatest office in the gift of the people. The probability of his attending morning services at his old church, the First Pres byterian, attracted a much larger congre gation than usual, although his arrival there caused no unusual curiosity. lie went to his old pew with out an usher, accompanied by his 6on, Russell U. Harrison, Mrs. Robert Mc- Kce, IJ. S. McKeo and Mrs. Clarkson. The services were of the usual order, the Rev. Dr. Haines, pastor of the church, occupying the pulpit. In his opening prayer the Doc tor invoked the blessing of God upon the man who sat but a few pews away, and prayed that Ho might guide him and his Cabinet in a continuance of their good works for the conntry's interests. Tho Doctor chose as his text the first and second verses of- the first chapter of He brews: God, who, at sundry times and in divers roauners, spoke in times past unto the fathers of the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things; by whom, also. He made tho worlds." The dis course was purely a doctrinal one on the gradual growth of revelation. There are portions of the Bible, the pastor said, which are difficult to comprehend, ard which cannot be explained by all rational believers. Critics . object io a single phrase, perhaps, and for that re ject the whole volume, while others detect a slip of Paul's pen or discover what were supposed to be mistakes of Moses, and at once refuse to believe at all. They are but proof-readers of the Bible, for thev do not endeavor to seek the hidden truths. Rev elation was given to man at different times and by gradual degrees, as well as in fragmentary and detached parts, but withal it has been a progressive development. There was no reference in the sermon to tho President, and after tho singing of a hymn the service closed in the usual way. 'As soon as the benediction had been pro nounced President Harrison, was greeted by a large number of his old friends and fellow-workers in tho church. Tho Presi dent then returned to the McKee residence, accompanied by his daughter. After din ner he went out for a stroll, with the res idence of his bister, Mrs. Samuel V, Morris, 43G Park avenne, as his objective point. The President spent most of the afternoon there. During his absence from Mrs. Mc- Kee's many of his home friends called, and were much disappointed at not meeting him. 'But others called after his return from his sister's home, and the President gave each one a cordial greeting. Politics andthe af fairs of the government were eschewed, 'and the conversation was coutined strictly to matters which friends like to talk about -after an extended separation. First Assistant Postmaster-general Clark son went to tho Central Christian Church in tho morning to hear the Rev. D. R. r Lucas. In Den Moines Mr. Lucus was his pastor, and tho meeting of the two added much to the pleasure of Colonel Clarkson's .visit. lr. Jcnckes. of St. Paul's Episcopal, 'was the pastor of Mrs. Clarkson's church in Des Moines. She regretted that tho cir cumstances of tho visit prevented her from hearing him. In the afternoon the Clark- eons visited Mr. and Mrs. McKee, and joined the President and his host and fam 1I3' at supper. They returned to the hotel early in the evening. r . Private Secretary Halford attended serv ices at the Central-avenue M. E. Church in the morning, and was present at the Sunday-school exercises in the afternoon. His welcome from tne members of the chprch and scbool was exceptionally cor dial. Mr. Halford during his residence ' here taught a large Bible class and several of his former pupils were present to greet him. In the course of a short address to ' the school Mr. Halford expressed the grati iication his visit to Indianapolis gave him. .He said he looked npon his friendships and associations here with tho keenest i pleasure, and valued them above all other connections. The Sunday-school lesson, which was illustrative of the visit of the : Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, was also the object of a few general remarks from him. The Queen of Sheba, Mr. Halford said, went to King Solomon with an hon est desire to know some of the reasons for the great prosperity of his kingdom. The speaker drew a practical lesson from this, and suggested, that the prosperity of any nation or peoplo came from the observance of truth, righteousness and obedience to God. The private car in which the presidential party meant to go to Chicago was placed on a epur at Tennessee street, shortly be fore 10 o'clock last night. The President, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Robert Mc Kee, w as driven from the residence of Mr. R. S. McKee to the car. The President and his daughter entered the coach, and a few minutes later retired for the night. Colo nel and Mrs. Clarkson and Private Secre tary Halford were the only otheroccupants of the car, Mr. McKee not accompanying his wife. Tho children were left here, and and will be taken East on the return of the party Tuesday morning. The President's privacy was not intruded upon, and, in deed, few knew th:t he was at or near the depot until shortly before the coach in special, but a regular, departed.

WORKING AD3lTNISTItATIOX. Some of the Things Accomplished and Ite- forms to He Carried Out. A party of gentlemen were seated in one of the parlors of the New Denison, on Sat urday evening, in conversation. Among them wa3 First Assistant Postmaster-general Clarkson, and he was asked what kind of an . administration he thought that of President Harrison to be. "This," he said, is a working, creative administration. It buckled down to work the first day, and without any parade it has already set in motion more plans for the improvement of the postal service than was ever before done in any four years. Tho State De partment has finished tho Samoan trouble, perfected a treaty with England, which the previous administration failed to ac complish, and has inaugurated the impnlse that will bring into closer relationship North and South America. The Treasury Department has begun upou its plan of in creasing tho circulation and settling the financial question without any fear of a panic. This administration has also in augurated several reforms in tho merchant murine. Tho Treasury Department has also brought forward new methods for policing Jrevenue matters, distilleries, etc. "In the Pohtotlica Department there has been a great increase m the efficiency of the service. That of the railway mail has had restored to it in eight months a great deal of the efficiency that it lost in the pre vious four year. Tho time between Sew York ami San Francisco has been shortened twenty-four hours, and will be shortened still more. The system in the largo cities of collections by horses lias beii inaug urated, and tho postal system iu New York, wnien tne party was asleep, was backed into the Union Station by a Pennsylvania engine. At 12:20 the train, which was not a Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia has been greatly improved. All the large cities are to be taken up in turn for the same im provement, vrhich will in time reach the smaller cities. Plana are .now beiug ar ranged for pneumatic service in cities, and it is the intention to apply railway meth ods of distribution of mail on the ocean steamers, which will obviate the de lay in the New York office. Flans are maturing foi the com fort and convenience of railway mail clerks and of clerks in large cities to de crease their labor and shorten their hours. A plan is nnder consideration to test the popularity of postal savings banks. Con gress will be asked to give the Postoffice Department authority to contract with telegraph companies, with a view to in augurate a system with different kinds of messages, so that less important messages may be delivered by postal carriers in cities and a lower rat given than upon those that do not require the quicker service. . "All tho other departments have made great reforms. Secretary Rusk in doing tho farming for the country in excellent man ner. His reports will be found of actual and practical value, and under bis admin istration the seed department will -gradually riso out of its former status of ridi cule and become of benefit to the country. The President and Cabinet are in perfect accord, and are reorganizing tho depart ments in the most harmonious spirit. The best compliment I can give tomes from newspaper men. tivo of whom -were talking together, and they joined in saying that there never was a time when newspaper people and everybody else had been treated with as much courtesy and cordiality as by this present administration in. all its de partments." The Wont Traitor Gone. Iow State Keglster. The death of Davis removes the last of the implacable group of traitors of whom ho was chief. Alexander Stephens, the Vice president of the Confederacy, died several years ago. Judah P. Reniamin; who tied to England at the close of the war, and never afterward set foot on the soil of the land he had dishonored, died in his voluntary exile. Jake Thompson, perhaps the mean est and most inhuman enemy of his coun try, died in Canada, having expatriated himself also. Robert Toombs, the most bit ter rebel of the whole group, who. like Davis, would never sue for mercy or ask for the restoration of the privileges of citizenship he, too, has died. R. M. T. Hunter, whose prospects for political power and honor were at one time as bright as the brightest, only to bo blighted by the hand of treason, died in obscurity and poverty a short time ago. Jeff" Davis is the last of the group of implacables to go. Other prominent confederates still remain. One of his Cabi net, Mr. Reagan, is now in the United States Senate. Rut the 'little group of unrecon structed, implacable rebels, who refused to accept with graco the decision of the war, who nursed the expiring fires of treason on the altars of their hearts that little group, with the death of Jell' Davis, has entirely passed away. The Administration. Minneapolis Tribune. v Let no good Republican think that he has any apologies to make for the main posi tions and acts of this current administra tion. In every department the federal gov ernment is moving positive', forcibly and sensibPy. .Between the well-considered movements of this administration that un derstands itself, and the erratic, half-insane performances of its predecessor "there could hardly be a greater contrast. The broad, masterly lines of the President's message show well the constructive platform of vital principles upon which the party stands, and upon which tho ad ministration is calmly playing its splendid role. The Democratic Way. New Albany Tribune, The criticisms on the message of President Harrison from the opposition press have been in the niaiu disgraceful, weak and pueriie. They show utter ignorance of the character of the message; they shamefully misrepresent it; they have not tho ability, apparently, to meet any of its points; they exhibit a painful lack of sense "in the mat ters of style and expression and clearness and force of language. They are such as to lower the estimate we would like to placo on American journalism. Idrice to Mothers, Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup should always be used when children are cutting teetb.

WORD ABOUT CATABBH. "It is the mucous membrane, that wonderful semi-fluid envelope surrounding the delicate tis sues of the air and food passages, that Catarrh makes its stronghold. Once established it eats into the very vitals and rendei-8 life but a long drawn breath of misery ana disease, dulling the sense of hearing, trammeling the itower of ppeech. destroying tbe faculty of mnell, tainting the breath, and killing the refined pleasures of taste. Insidiously, by creeping on from a simple cold in the head, it assaults the membranous lin ing and envelops the bones, eating through the delicate coats and causing inflammation, plough ing and death. Nothing short of total eradica tion will secure health to the patient, and all al leviatives are simply procrastinated sufferings, liMirUnf tn :i f u till Iprmim t Inn s;.iifii-l'a l.1l I cal Cure, by inhalation and by Internal admlnis I tration, has never failed; even when the disease nasmace inguuui inroaus on delicate constitu tions, hearing, smell and taste have been recov ered and the disease thoroughly driven out."
