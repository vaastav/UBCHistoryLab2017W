WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1923 JOHN WANAMAKER. John Wanamaker, merchant prince and philanthropist may not have been the inventor of the one-price system of modern retail merchandising, but he made it popular and initiated the practice of marking goods in plain figures with the same price to all. Only elderly people will realize what a tremendous change this was. In earlier days those who went to the store bargained for what they wanted, and the shrewdest bargainer got the best price. Over a great part of the continent of Europe this old-fashioned system is still in use. It is, indeed, the immemorial sys tem and will be found in operation in most ancient communi ties. This contribution entitles Mr. Wanamaker to a high place in the temple of business fame. He performed herein a great service to his country. Mr. Yv'anamaker obtained distinction as Postmaster Gen eral. He favored the parcel post, and public ownership of ex press companies and enunciated the famous saying, '"the four reasons that stand in the way of the parcel post are the four great express companies." Once more f question is raised of the relation between the successful hie and the fund of energy contained in th& organism of the man who leads the life. Mr. Wanamaker died at the advanced age of 85 years after a life active up to a period comparatively recent. Mr. Wanamaker put thinking at the head of the requisites of success. In the second place, he put industry and in the third place "trying" by which, perhaps, he meant the exercise of faculty for progress. PROHIBITION. Ralph H. White, Superintendent of the Connecticut Anti Saloon League, commends Judges Boardman and Gomley of the City Court because they have enforced the liquor law in Bridge port. He points out that the situation here is much better than the situation in New Haven and says that bootleggers are giv ing Bridgeport a wide berth. To these views he adds that ''Bridgeport has the advantage of a dry press, while the New Haven press is the wettest in the State." The Times is neither wet nor dry. The Times believes that the law exists to be enforced. It has commended and it will continue to commend Judge Boardman, Judge Comley, the Police Department and others who perform the duty which the law imposes upon them. With respect to the policy of wet or dry, this has been de termined by the nation. The Times confines itself to ascertaining and stating the facts as they appear, but seeks to indicate the sentiment of the citizenship of the nation as opposed to the opinion of the nation itself, expressed in the constitution. Tliis opinion is about as follows : that a vote in New York New England or Pensyivania would probably give a majority for the repeal of prohibition; that there are some other states in which this would also be true; that a majority of the states probably, upon vote, would favor prohibition. There were, when the constitutional amendment was adopted, some 30 states which were dry by a state enactment. It seems, therefore, improbable that the amendment can be repealed. It would require the action of thirty-six states to change the constitution. Neither does it seem probable that Congress could afford any relief because the Supreme Court very early rendered an opinion that neither Congress nor the legislative bodies of any of the states have authority or power to legalize any alcoholic drink 'that will actually make the drinkers drunk. WILSON'S FAITH JUSTIFIED. The New York Herald says that the restoration of Shantung to China is a triumph for American diplomacy. It adds that the action was largely the outcome of the Wash ington conference, and the firm stand made by the American delegation in support of the "open door" policy announced by Secretary of Slate John Hay, a quarter of a century ago. In this action it is almost possible to claim anything. The more plausible proposition, however, is that the ar rangement is the result of engagements made between Japan and the allied and associated powers while the Treaty of Ver sailles was in process. Woodrow Wilson, attacked by various individuals for the Shantung clause in the Treaty, simply said that Japan had agreed to get out and that Japan shortly would get out. What Mr. Wilson said would happen has happened, no doubt, under the precise understanding entered into in Paris. A SAGEBRUSH CINDERELLA By Max Brand (ConUnued from yesterday.) Synopsis. .Taccuielina During whose father kept the cross-roads hotel is a red headed, freckled faced girl of about nineteen. With growing resentment she realizes that the men who frequent her father's hostelry pay no attention to her. So when her father summons her to wait on table in the dining room she is not in a very pleasant frame of mind. Sua notes with envy that all the young men are dressed for the dance to be held in tsnaeweu that evening, but no one invites her. One rather unkempt individual arouses her ire by his impertinent stare. The diners have left and her brother and father tell her to forget the dance. When all had gone, Jac as she is called, goes out to the porch. There she finds the slovenly stranger, who begins to twit her about tna dance. The stranger says his name is Bill Carrigan. He asks Jac a lot of que tion and then drives off. In Bride well, he visits the barber, and the general store, where he buys an out fit for himself and Jacqueline, 'men he returns to During's hotel and pro ceeds to transform the gi.-l Cinderella like, into a stunning creature. First he blots out her freckles, then he starts on her hair, which she wore in a, tight knot. When at length Jacqueline is com pletely dressed, she looks like an other person. She and Carrigan go by a short cut to Bridewell for the dance. In the dance hall Jacqueline becomes at once the cynosure of all eyes. She "stood in the spot light like a queen. She knew that her color had heightened. She knew that the flare of the gasoline lamp made her hair a glorious dull-red Are touched with golden points of light, which fell again on the necklace at her throat, the only heirloom she had received from her mother, and still further down on the bronze slippers."

The admiration of the men filled Jac's heart; the trouble in the more covert stares of the girls overflowed it. A sense of power flooded in her like electricity. She knew that when she turned and dropped her hand on the arm of Carrigan it sent a tingle through him. Her smile was casual and her eyes calm. Her whisper was surcharged with a vital anxiety. "Do you dance well? "Regular ' fairy,' "grinned Carrigan, and she wished his mouth was not so broad. "How about you?" "Not so bad." "Let's start." Dancers are not made even by in finite pains and lessons. They are born, and Jac was a born dancer. With the smooth floor underfoot, the light slippers, the pulse and urge of the music, however crude, the new born sense of dignity and womanly power, she became an artist. She danced not to the music, but to what the music might have been. Through the film of pleasure she vaguely Knew that people were giv ing way a little before her. She knew the eyes of the men were upon her face and the sway of the graceful body, and among those eyes she found one pair more bright and devouring than all the rest. It was Maune Gor don. He was dancing with a little golden- haired beauty, Dolly Maxwell. She let her eyes rest carelessly upon him. She smiled. Handsome Maurie start ed as though some one had stepped on his foot. He stumbled he lost his step his little partner frowned ur at him and then flashed a look of utter hate toward Jac. A girl may guess at the heart of a man, but she can absolutely read the soul of another woman. It is a subtle system of wire less which tells a thousand words in a single smile; a glance is a spark driven by ten thousand volts. The heart of Jacqueline swelled with the Song of Songs." "Do something!" she murmured in the ear of Carrigan. He met her eyes with a cold under standing. "You've just seen Maurie Gordon?" he asked. "You're dancing wonderfully." she pleaded, "but do something new." "Do you know the Carrigan cut?" "I'll try it." "It's a cross between a glide, a dip, and a roll. Take three short steps, then take a long, draggy slide to the left -and let yourself go." The trombine started an upward flourish. They followed it, running forward. She began the draggy step to the left and then let herself go. How it was done, the could not tell, but somehow he took her weight in the m.ddle of the step and they com pleted a little dipping whirl as grace ful as the lilt of a seagull against a. flury of wind. A gasp of applause broke out around them. The dancers veered further off to allow room for these beautiful new meneuvers. And Jac queline, dizzy with the Joy of con quest, saw the set, white face of Dolly Maxwell. It was the golden drop or honey in the wine of victory. The music stopped, but the rhythm still ran in her mood. Carrigan's rather coldly curious stare sobered her. "What's the matter?" he asked!. ''I see a freckle comin' out to iooJc the landscape over. Sorry you ain't got that powder-puff with you." "I have it, all right." "I didn't know you had pockets in that dress." "It's my corpage." "Your which?" "Look at that funny trombone player." He turned to stare at the shiny bald head. and when he looKeu back she had just slipped sometning into the bosom of her dress. All traces of the freckle were gone. She flushed a little under his eyes of in quiry. Then very anx:ously: "Is it gone?" "It's behind a coud, anyway," said Carrigan. "Here's Maurie Gordon." The big cowpuneher came up earnest-eyed. "If you're not hooked up for this next waltz." he began He stopped with a widening stare. She had glanced carelessly over him from head to foot, and now turned her back on him to take the arm or Carrgan. The movement was slow, deliberate, casuel. It left big Maune Gordon crimson and breathing nara, the butt of open laughter from all. Boston Firm Awarded Fairfield Bond Issue Fairfield, Dec. 13.

Carr:gan found Jac trembling with excitement, though her face was still ca!m. "What the devil." he began. "I thought Gordon was the man vou wanted " "Don't you get me?" she broke In eagerly. "None of those swell East ern ladies would bat an eye at a bum who cam? up to them without bein" introduced." "Oh!" said Carrigan. "And who " "You will." she answered without hesitation. "Take me over to a chair and walk up to the bar and get , drink. When all the boys flock around around and ak about me." He growled: "How do you Know they'll flock around and ask about yon ?" Thr was something akin to nltv in her smile. The stsaute waa waJkiar away from Pygmalion. "Take it from me. They will. Your money ain't any good at that bar ;ike me to that chair standing away com therest of them rjecaase- every man will be wainti-n- to make your ac quaintance an' buy you liquor. Drink beer, Carrie. I hate t breath. Then they'll ask about me. an' you tell 'em that I'm straight from the East, an' don't understand Western ways. Tell 'em they'll have to be introduced:. An don't bring over any one I don't point out." "Beginning with Gordon?" "Sure. Bring him first." "Who's next? Are you goin to corral 'em ail?" "If I want to." They sat down Carrigan rather gingerly, and edging away from her. "You see that skinny feller with the black hair?" "Yep." "That's Dave Carey. He's engaged to that girl with the smile an' the fluffy pink dress. She called me a 'horrible tomboy' once. You can bring Dave Oarey next." "Goin" to bust up the happy homes. Jac?" "Miss Silvestre," she corrected. "Watch Jenny Hendrix stare at me! She's whispering, too. I hate her. Then there's Ben Craig, the tall man with the thin, sad lookin' face. Once when he was at the hotel ho said my head was more like a turkey egg than a face. You c'n bring him third. I'll think of some more after a while." "How're you goin' to keep up the bluff with all those feJlers? They'll spot your lingo in a minute." Jacqueline waved the suggestion airily away. I read a book once," she said, and her smile was very close to the grin of Jac During, now no more. "It told about an Eastern girl who came West an' she was Herrible thrilled about tne Western men. She had a great lingo. I'll stick by what she said." "What was it?" "Mar. Carrigan, have you lived all your life in the West?" "Sure," He started and stared at her. "Is that part of the lingo?" "I knew you had been all your lire out here in these big open spaces. It makes you so much more real than the Eastern men." "Huh," grunted Carrigan, ana blinked rapidly. "Do you know that I feel that you but you would think me foolish if I said it." "You bet your lifte I wouldn't!" gasped Carrigan. She leaned closer and dropped a hand on his arm. Her gaze dwelt tenderly on his startled eyes. "I feel that you are the first real man I have ever known, Mr. Carri gan." "The devil you do!" "Yes. All the men I have met nave been so superficial. But you are like your own great West, Mr. Carrigan, with a heart as wide as the desert and as open as the sky. I feel it. Am I foolish to tell you this?" Carrigan loosened his bandanna. "Jac, are you goin' to pull this sort of line on all the boys?" he asked hoarsely. "Sure I am. Why not? Don't it get by?" "There's be gun-play before the night's over, you c'n lay that ten to one." "Why? "Don't look at me- like that! You make me nervous. It ain't what you say so much as the way you say it. Where'd you learn that way ow talkin'?" "I been to the movies, an' I used my eyes. I've seen Maude Merriam an' come home an' practised! at the mirror. Has she got anything on me?" "She generally ain't go half so much on," groaned Carrigan, and rose. "Wait a minute, Carrie! "Say, Cinderella, maybe I'm the fairy godmother, but don't go callin' me by a woman's name. The bnanfl don't no ways look well on my hide." "All right Mr. Carrigan, But just remember this: That ain't the Car rigan cut that we done in the last dance." He rubbed a hand across h!s rorr head. "It's the Si'lverstre slide." "What?" ''Sure. I introduced It in New York, an' everybody In the Five Hun dred copied it an' named It arter me. It made an awful hit." Carrgan fled. He went straight for the bar by instinct, for he began to need a drink. Jacqueline proved a prophet. As he dropped his coin on the bar a broad hand swtpt it back to him. He looked into the handsome serkvus face of Maurie Gordon. "Partner." said Maurie, "this drink's on me. My nam's Gordon.'-' "Wait a minute, Maurie," broke in another voice. "You're lickerin' w'th me, friend. I'm Dave Carey. Glad to meet you. Two comin' up, bar tender!" "I'm drlnkin' beer," said Carrigan, I remembering orders. An odd look, which he understood I perfectly, came in the eyes of the i other men. "Look here," went on Maurie, "that girl you brung to the dance is a hell bender. If you ain't dancin' all evenin' with her. maybe I could break in, eh?" He reinforced his suggestion with a broad wink and a tremendous slap on the shollder. "Maybe you could," said Carrigan. "I'll have to introduce you. Miss Silvestre is straight from the East, an' she don't quite geit the hang of our Western ways." "Straight from the East?" "Yep New York, an' all that. j Blood as blue as hell." "The devil!" "It is, all right, till vou get to know her." "Howd you pick her up?" "She's baen visitin' at the ranch where I work. We sort of ran off 'together tonight. She was strong for some sort of a lark. Kind of nifty." Tu she?" 'But you got to talk careful to her get me?" "I'll hang on to my tongue like it was a buckin bronco." "Then toiler me." "Hold on." said Carey desperately. "Carrigan, don't I get no look in here?" "What d'you want to go hanging around with every girl in the country for?" queried Gordon, and his frown was dangerous. "Ain't you engaged already ?" "Am I?" replied Carey with an om inous lowing of the voice. "An' ain't Dolly Maxwell got you Toped and throwed ?" "Suppose," broke in Carrigan anx iously, "that you get introduced at the same time an then Gordon c'n have the first dance an' you get the next." They compromised on this basis i and trooped obediently behind Carri gan. "Wai- a minute." said Gordon. Maxwell?" "Surr." said Carrigan. I They stopped before the girl of the I golden hair. There was soul deep i understanding in the cold eye she fi-ted upon Maurie Gordon. Carri , can received gushing recognition, not for him. he knew, but for the partner o the sensation in green. "Thr. next dance? Sure you can have K. Good-by, Maurie." But her Dartinc shot wfls wasted n thin air. Maurie was headed for ither and more pleasant regions, and he light of the discoverer was in his iyo. He was a new Balboa looking ut upon another Pacific. They anged before Jac. "Miss Silvestro, this is Mr. Gordon, an' Mr. Carey." Maurie searched hie memory. iteeled his nerves .and spoke: "I sure feel it's a privilege to know you." "Me, too," said Carey ,and then bit his lips. The scorn of a superior irstelli. -rence was haughty in the face of big Maurie. "Thank you," Jlac was saying. "Will you sit down?" "Sure," said Maurie, and plumped into the car beside her. "Maybe vou ain't got the next dance taken. Can I have it? Thanks." He glared his triumph at Carey who turned away, dark-eyed with onvy. "So-long," he said, and turned on his heel. Ho joined Dave Carey. "Fourteen degrees of frost in her smile," said thait worthy, "but I'm bettin' on a river runnin' under the ice." "Are you goin' to dance?" "Nope. I need a drink. Have one on me?" "I got work ahead," said Carrigan, and made for Dolly Maxwell. EX-KAISER PICTURED TO BE "IDEAL LADY'S MAN" AND EXEMPLAR LOVER CHAPTER VI. The Girl From Fifth Avenue. "So long," quoted Jac. "Is that the Western way of saying good-by, Mr. Gordon?" There was a serious question in her eyes. Maurie leaned back ar.J drew a deep breath. "Maybe your friend Carrigan talks that way, an' I've heard some others say the same thing, but it ain't con sidered partic'lar choice. Most "f says "adois," or something like that,' "Oh, I thought it was rather queer, but then Mr. Carrigan is" she paused "rather quee r in lots of ways!" It was plain that she considered him different. The music began. They danced: The rta.th.er diiffident arm of big Maurice gathered strength and confidence. "You sure c'n throw your feet!" be burst out at length. "You ain't travelin' very far be hind," said Jac amiably. The Girl From Fifth Avenue. She felt Maurie start. She knew with a growing coldness of heart that he was staring down at her face with question. With a great effort she made her eyes rise and rest art lessly upon his. She was hunting her book vocaibuiary desperately. "I've picked that up from the Western vernacular," Mr. Gordon. Does it sound natural?" "It sure does." The doubt was gone from his face. The trumph reinforced her smile. Dolly Maxwell sailed by in tihe arms of Carrigan. They were dancing beautifully. "Say," said Gordon with sudden anxiety. "What was the funny step you done with Carrigan?" "That was the Silvestre Slide, as they call it in New York." "Oh." "I invented it and it was picked up all along Fifth Avenue. TouTe no idea how quickly things spread in New York. They named it after me." In his awe 'he almost lost step. She enjoyed his consternation for a mo ment and then in pity spoke: "Shall we try it?" "D'you really think I could get away with it?" "Get away with it. Mr. Gordon?" 'I mean, d'you think I could be taught?" "Oh, yes. It's this way. It a a cinch, aa you say out here in the West!" They started the maneuver, hut Gordon was afflicted with stage frght. He blundered miserably. A snicker Bounded about them, and de sire for murder flooded the heart of Jacqueline, for Carrigan and Dolly Maxwell had just executed the eflep perfectly. She set her teeth and drove ahead. "Mr. Gordon, have you lived all your life in the West?" "Yep. Every day of It!" She sighed. Then: "That is why you are so dif ferent. In the East the boys are so well, so artificial!" "Huh?" said Maurie vaguely. "That so?" "But you are like your own Wild West; with a heart as big as your mountain-desert and as open as your skies!" The arm of Maurie tightened. She felt his breath coming quickly against her hair, and she thought of the spill ed coffee and the "damnation" of earlier in that same evening. Life was sweet indeed. "What makes you so unusual, Mr. Gordon?" Once, twice her lips stirred before the words came, "It's a hard life on ths range, tl takes a strong man to get by." "You look strong, Mr. Gordon." Laughter makes the voice purr, and there was a caress in the tone or Ja'cqueie. He stiffened, throwing his shouiders back. "In a pinch I've done a man's work," he said modestly. "I've heard about men who can take a steer by the horns and wrest'ie until they throw the big animal but I suppose that it just Western jok ing?" "Nope. I don't think nothin" at all of throwin' a steer." "Oh! And aren't you afraid of of their nasty horns?" She stammered with admiration and wonder. "I was brung up to take chances. Throwin' a steer ain't much for a man like me. You see, I got the size for It. A feller needs weight on the range." "But some of these cowpunchers seem quite slender." "Yep. But they don't count much for a real man's work. Take Carri gan, over there. I guess he's a pretity fair sort when it comes to gettin' around, but he ain't Bot the weight. I guess he weighs about twenty pounds less'n I do." "Do you kow that I feel but you would think me foolish if I said it!" "Lady Miss Miss Silvertre, you c'n lay ten to one I won't think any thing you sav is foolish!" "Well, then I feel as if you are the only real man I have ever known." ''Honest?" said the deep, quivering voice. "Yes. The rest I cannot under stand. I I stlffle among them!" "You ain't stringin' me along?" "What other men say are merely words. But such a man as you are, speaks from the heart. I know! I could believe you!" "Miss Silvestre " J "Isn't it usual in the West to be called by first names?" There was a sound of choking. Her wide, wondering eyes raised to him. "Or is it wrong, Mr. Gordon? To be called by one's given name names to me freedom!" "My name's Maurie." The hoarseness of his voice was the music of the spheres. "And mine is Jacqueline." "It's a wonderful name!" f "Say it." "Jacqueline!" She looked tip with childish curios ity. i have never heard it spoken that way before. It aeemg it seems to me free-like your own wild west!" 'Ain't you been free?" Her head fell. Her left hand pressed his in her effort to keep back the bubbling laughter. He returned che grip with a mighty interest, T have lived all my life in a con vent!" He started. "I thought you was hangin' out along Fifth Avenue?" It was a close squeeze. She bless ed a sudden thundering on the slide (Copyright 1922 by International News Service.) Revelations of the former German Kaiser as a "lady's mail and lover- a side of his character that was hitherto hidden to the outside world are made today in an exclusive interview with Frau Gabriele Von Rochow, to whom the ex-war lord was secretly en gaged for six months. This entuigenieut as exclusively told by in ternational News yesterday, was broken off by the former kaiser as the result of pressure from members of his entourage. In the following exclusive story Frau Von Roeliow tells of letters from Wilhelm even after his marriage to Princess II ermine of Reuss. By S. D. WEYEK, International News Service Staff Correspondem (Copyright 1922 by International News Service.) Berlin. Dee. 13. (I. N. S.) ' Nothing is more terrible thai to sete your life's idol and your ideal in life shattered at your feet." Frau Gabriele Von Rochow. "the other woman ' in the love triangle in which the former kaiser is the central figure, fixed a pair of steel-blue eyes upon the correspondent in a brave ef fort to stem the flood of tears that were welling up. "Life to me." she continued, "now seems like one greai. yawning emptiness. Can vou imagine an altar that is without. its deity In. her'hand Frau Von Rochow held a four-page letter written m steep, awkward German script, strangely contrasting with the signature, which was none other than "W.lhelm," written with the usual flourish that used to impress officials in the oia German empire. The letter had just reached Frau Von Rochow today, although it was dated "Doom. Holland, .NovemDer 28" It did not come through the ordinary mails. It was brought to Berlin by a trusted courier. Suddenly her hand tightened its grip and the letter crumpled up in her fist as she exclaimed: Tjauds No-.- WTife. "Why does he write to me? Why does he send me these errusions ex tolling the beauty and capabilit.es of his new wife instead of just saying one single word which woulid put a stop to the campaign of slander against me? "Here he writes to me that Her mine is wonderful; that she is just the kind of wife for him.' Then ne tells me about George Viereck (an American journalist) having visited him at Doom and to watch for the article that Viereck will publish about him. , , , "But there is not a single world saying he is sorry for the way I was treated. And to think that I have been his intimate friend since 1SS4. and for six months was secretly en gaged to marry him. It is dreadful. And I have been called his "house keeper' in stories obviously inspired from the house of Doom to serve as an alibi for Princess Hermine." Frau Von Rochow looked at the letter in her hand and continued: "Here on this separate half page he has written a dedication to me which he asks me to pase in a copy of his memoirs he has ordered his publishers to send to me.' Tosses Photo Away. Frau Von Rochow tossed a picture of the former Kaiser upon a table, asking the interviewer to read the Inscription on it. William had writ ten: "To his dear Markgi-aefin from Margraef." These were pet names by whih the course had known eacn other for nearly four decades. Frau Gabriele said they had been chums since Wilhelm was 20 and sne 18. The word Margraef is an allu sion to the feudal past when fore bears of the Hohenzollerns and the Rochows were bitter enemies attack ing each other in their castles in what was then called Mark -Brandenburg. It was the neuoleus of the later Prus sian kingdom. BRYAN FLAYS RULE BY RICH (Continued From Page One. "I am glad that we have a repre sentative at Lausanne. I think that we should respond to every call for advice with the und-erstanding that we reserve the right to decide for our selves what we shall do and that we are not bound by any action taken by other nations in regard to Euro pean affairs. "In other words, without surrender ing independence of action we should exert our moral influence to the full toward the promotion of universal peace. Should Aid World Peace. "There is no sentiment whatever towards an alliance such as Clemen ceu adveaotes. If the question were submitted to a popular vote I douot if there is a voting precinct in the United States would vote for ay anli lance with France or any other Euro pean country. "The European nations have mili tary aspirations, commercial ambi tions and colonial pellicles with which we have no sympathy and with whicn we can have no part. These inter ests, wholly their own would make it Impossible for them to consider our position. Our wishes or our welfare when they took measures that might ead to war. "I believe that they would be more likely to follow a peaceful course without an alliance than They would if they commanded our resources for the advancement of their interests. ' The Commoner, though expressing an optimistic tone in considering what the New Year may bring to the coun try was vigorously opiposed to what he termed a country "ruled by the rich." "The disease from which the coun try is now suffering," he said, "can best be described as the 'rule of the rich ' This explains the results of the last election. The farmers, one third of our nation, have been turned over to the profiteers for plunder and exploitation.

"But where a strike or a lockout actually occurs, as in the two last summer, I think the best remedy is authority on the part of the govern ment, state and national, in so far as the difliulty is local or general, to take over the business and operate It until employers and enii-jyees reach an agreement. The power would not bo exercised unless strikes or lock outs were of sufficient magnitude Ko interfere with business. "There is nc wrong without a rem edy. The government must there fore have, power to do anything need ed for the protection of the public. Prohibition Enforcement. Concerning prohibition. Bryan said: "The enforcement of prohibition is better than the wet papers represent it. They do all that they can to prevent enforcement and then demand the repeal of the law on the ground that it is not enforced. They are not logical or consistent. There were 6.000 automobiles stolen in New York city last year and fewer than half found, yet they do not demand the repeal of the law against stealing au tomobiles. "Whenever the federal government has had the co-operation of state and municipal authorities the enforcement of the law has been notably success ful. AVhen the local sentiment sup ports lawlessness and where officials are elected pledged to non-enforcement the situation cannot be entirely satisfactory. There is more pa triotism in finding a remedy than in finding fault. Conference of Governors. "The President suggests a confer ence of governors.. That will be good. At that meeting a line will be drawn between the dry governors who are working for enforcement and the wet governors who encourage law lessness. "The prohibition authorities are greatly discouraged by the fact that wet senators and wet congressmen lecommend wet applicants for posi tions as enforcement officers. It would be as reasonable to expect pro fessional horse thieves to make good sheriffs and prosecute horse thieves. "New legislation will be necessary from time to time to correct defects found In the law. I think a long step would be taken if the federal government would take over all whlf -key on hand, paying for it what it was worth before prohibition gave it a fic titious value. The government could distribute it as It is needed for medi cine. Would War On Smugglers. "But Just now one of the most im perative needs is national action which will drive the smugglers from our coasts. It is absurd to invoke the three mil? limit rule for the pro e--tion of smugglers. That rule war never intended for any such situation as we now have. It was intended to protect for search inside the three mile limit of legitimate trading vessels. Those li quor carrying crafts are engaged in illegitimate business They belong to the pirate class. They deliberately conspire against the laws of the Uni ted States. No civilized nation can offer to permit its flag to be- used for such a purpose and no friendly nation will seek to protect vessels thus dis gracing its flag when the subject is properly presented to them. Our government should assume- that no friendly nation will willingly have any part in conspiracies against our laws. We should notify these governments Off what is going on and say to them that if they find it impossible to treat with the situation from a distance we will relieve them of the trouble and deal with them a3 criminals where we find them. "Prohibition is the permanent pol icy of this country. There is not the slightest prospect of a return to the old conditions." trombone. All fat men have kind hearts, she decided. "Yes, but only for a little while. Only for a few months. Then they brought me west." The last paragraph of a third in stalment rose word by word before her eyes. "They thought to bury me in the west' Even out here they guard me like a criminal: Tonight T had to run away to be with you you all. But they cannot bury me in this coun try. I look upon the stars at night and do not feel alone. The desert is my friend. I feel its mystery. And I feel the tru;h and strength of the men of the desert. Some where among them I shall find one friend!" She bowed her head again. "Some memory, Jac!" she was say ing to herself. The deep rumble of his voice, brok en and passionate, broke in upon her. "By God, you have found that friend. I'm him!" "Mr. Gordon Maurie!" He couldn't speak! The music stopped, and as it died away they caught a clear laugh from across the hall. "The feller that come with you seems to be havin' a ,pretty fair sort of a time," said Maurie. Jac looked up. There was Carri gan laughing heartily with DolrV Maxwell. She seemed extremely beau tiful when she laughed, and her yoice was musical it rose over the babble of the dance hall like the chime of a bell, Jac set her teeth. She re membered the Carrigan Cut as Mau rie had failed to do it! Dave Carey was approaching. (To Be Continued Tomorrow.)
