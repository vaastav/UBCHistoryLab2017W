December 7. HARDSHIP TO NEW YORKER.— Louis J. Van Echatck. 4th Infantry, or the well known New York family, probably win be the ob ject of special legislation curing the present ses sion of Congress. He has been detailed as a cap tain of Philippine, scouts, and at present is on de tached service as governor of Cavite province, a place requiring the. exercise of administrative discretion. He is under expense while serving in that capacity, and it has been decided that he may not receive the pay of a captain, but must revert to the pay of a first lieutenant of infantry. This operates as a hardship to him. but there is no way under the law of considering an officer detailed as a captain of Philippine scouts as en titled to that pay when ho is not actually purring in the detailed position. Lieutenant Van Schalck has been rendering an excellent account of himself in Cavite. and th*> War Department Is disposed to do everything possible In his behalf.
