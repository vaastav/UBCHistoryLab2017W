Non-partisan in Charge ausociated press dispatch JUAREZ, Dec. 2. Seven of the generals of the Mexican regular army are ready to surrender and the backbone of the Huerta dictatorship in northern Mexico is broken. A peace commission arrived at Juarez tonight bearing terms of surrender. The peace commission headed by Odilon Hernandez, came from Chi huhahua bearing a proclamation signed by General Salvador Mercado, Huerta's military governor and com mander of all the federal forces in the north. The proclamation stated that the Huerta government is bank rupt and unable to pay its soldiers. The simultaneous with the evacua tion of the other federal strongholds in the north is believed by the re bels to be the result of a concerted decision to abandon northern Mexico. The peace proposals sent by General Mercado to Villa through Federico Moye, civil governor of Chihuahua Mate, appointed ad interim. Along with it came an appeal from all the foreign consuls in Chihuahua call ing upon Villa to give police pro tection to the citizens of Chihuahua City. General Mereado's proclamation said: "Under the circumstances which have existed in Chihuahua it has been deemed necessary that the fed eral troops evacuate. I leave in charge Federico Move, a person not identified with politics, who there fore is qualified to give full protec tion to foreigners. It is impossible to remain here longer, as there is no money with which to pay the troops." The generals who signified through General Mercado, their willingness to surrender, but who nevertheless are fleeing to the United States border are: General Salvador Mercado. Pasqual Orozco, Jose Ynez Salazar, Marcello Caraveo. Jose Manzilla, Blazor Pinal and General Lamada. The peace commission stated that before leaving Chihuahua the erals destroyed all the postage government revenue stamps, there is virtually no money in fed and that Chi- huahua. that two thousand citizens left with the troops and most of them being those who are rich and who feared harsh treatment by the rebels. The commission started back to Chihuahua tonight with Villa's as surance that people of all clases in the city, including the federal police will be protected, and he will dis patch troops to garrison the place as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the action of the federals Villa him self is preparing for the departure southward. He said that Chihuahua will be the only stopping place on his southward march, as he is deter mined to continue on to Mexico City. Fleeing over the desert and pursued by rebels, several thousand persons, including some of the richest families in northern Mex ico who deserted Chihuahua City in fear of a rebel attack are reported tonight as nearing the United States border. Among the refugees is L,uis Terrazas, the head of the wealthy Terrazas estate, who is said to have with him five million pesos which he withdrew from the Chihuahua banks. Other wealthy families, including the Creels are known to have left the city and the caravan is composed also of women and children, de scribed as being more than one mile long. At the head, with an escort of federal troops, is General Salva dor Mercado, Huerta's deposed gov ernor of Chihuahua state. Details of the evacuation of the city were brought to Juarez in of ficial despatches from Federico Moye, who was appointed . civil governor ad interim. The Move dispatch, ad dressed to General Villa called upon the rebel leader to take possession of the city. The facts about the downfall of the Huerta power in the city, as transmitted Governor Moye, were: "For almost three weeks Chihua hua, with its 35,000 citizens has been cut off from communication, food supplies have been steadily decreas- ing and many deaths resulted from illness caused by semi-starvation.

The president stood exactly twenty eight minutes before the assem bled seriate and house to read his first annual message, em bodying the legislative ambition of the democratic administration. Applause punctuated his utter ances and there were deafening cheers when he finished.

ASSOCIATE!! PRESS DISTATCHl WASHINGTON, D. C, December 2. President Wilson this afternoon read his annual message before both branches of congress sitting jointly. The message follows in full: Gentlemen of the Congress: In pursuit of my constitutional du ty to "give to the congress informa tion of the state of the union," I take the liberty of addressing you on sev eral matters which ought, as it seems to me, particularly to engage the at tention of your honorable bodies, as of all who study the welfare and progress of the nation. I shall ask you indulgence if I ven ture to depart in some degree from the you ters tion usual custom of setting before in formal review the many mat which have engaged the atten and called for the action of the several departments of the govern ment or which look to them for early treatment in the future, because the list is long, very long, and would suf fer in the abbreviation to which Ij should have to subject it. I shall submit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention of your committees and of all members of the congress who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of the gov ernment, makes comment and empha sis on my part unnecessary. The country, I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the na tions manifest their w ilingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes of frankness and fair concession. So far the United States has stood at the front of such negotiations. She will, I earnestly hope and confidently believe, give fresh proof of her sin cere adherence to the cause of inter national friendship of ratifying the several treaties of arbitration await ing renewal by the senate. In addition to these, it has been the privilege of the department of state to gain the assent in principle, of no less than 31 nations representing four-fifths of the population of the world, to the negotiation of treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differ ences of interest or of policy arise which can not be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall be publicly analyzed, discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal cho sen by the parties before either na tion determines its course of action. There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the United States and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those already assumed. There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mex ico. There can be no certain pros pect of peace in America until Gen. Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is un derstood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United States. We are the friends of constitutional gov ernment in America: we are more than its friends, we are its cham pions; because in no other way can our neighbors to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty. Mexico has no government. The at tempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set U which has hardly more than the sem blance of national authority. It or iginated in the usurpation of Victori ano Huerta, who, after a brief at tempt to play the part of constitu tional president, has at last cast aside (Continued on Page

The scene today was much the j same as on the three previous occh- j sions wnen President Wilson has ad- : dressed congress. The galleries ivcn crowded with men and women of importance in public alfairs, members: op the cabinet, the diplomatic corps! and the White House family. Demo- j iratic lead i s w ere enthusiastic in tl.eir comments on the mess-age and 'ts recommendations. They liked the emphasis applied by the president on the need for early action on the currency, for dealing with monopoly through anti-trust legslath n. the im rortancc of rural legislation, recom mendations of the goernmnt cons-unction of railroads in Alaska, the development of the nation's lesources I y a conservation policy alike ac ceptable to states and ledcral author ities, the enactment of employers' lia bility legislation and the selection of presidential candidates by the pri mary system. The suggestion of the president that the party as at present constituted h abolished, won striking applause. As Mr. Wilson de 'dared. a party convention shouhl be held only to ratify the verdict of the preference rtimaries, and that the personnel of the conventions should be for the most part chosen from those mem bers of congress ajid congressional nominees upon whom would devolve the duty of carrying out the platform pledges, there was a wave of hand clapping in which the secretary and members of the cabinet joined. For nearly all of the legislation outlined in the message the giound work has been laid and the president plans to speak further to congress with relation to the anti-trust re- ! forms. Alaskan railroad legislation ' is now before both houeses. the work- j man's compensation act has been favorably considered and each of the house bills on other important sub jects are in a position to receive immediate attention. The house for hours today debated on the Hensley resolution to commit the United States to the Winston Churchill plan for an international jears noliday on naval construction and tonight advocates of the project predicted the passage of the resolution in the house by late Friday. Consider ation w ill be resumed on Thursday with both sides, the advocates far outnum bering the opponents, prepared to con tinue the debate. Deader Underwood said on the floor of the house that the resolution probably would be passed unanimously. Without formal action the democrats of the senate put jnto operation today the drastic programme adopted for consideration of the administration currency bill. Republicans prevented a vote on the motion calling a continu ous session of the senate at 10 o'clock morning until 1 1 o'clock at night, but the democrats kept the senate in ses sion tonight. Postmoster-General Rurleson report ed to congress today that during the year ending June SO, the postal sav ings deposits had increased from over $20,000,000 to nearly $40,000,000, and the number of depositors from 24.01 to 331,003.

SCORES IN ARMS I PLOTTING CASES The government scored in the case against the Phelps-Dodge nnd others vesterdav when Judge Siwtelle announced he would not I question the power of the senate to ueciare an act criminal wiui out going through the usual pro cedure of forming a statute. The joint resolution which is in ef fect a passed bill, approved by the president is the legal basis of a felony action. The govern ment was also successful in get ting many of the objections of the defense ovei ruled, and in introducing certain testlmony and one exhibit. The defense scored when it compelled the United States to change its tactica and approach the c.ise from a new angle, pleading that talv.it among' the conspirators did not constitute evidence before evidence of a conspiracy had been introduced. By a long and cautious feeling out process, the first neutrality case jury was obtained in federal court yesterday and the trial of the "Phelps-Dodge" case started by tho prosecution. Immediately the de fense started a series of objections, calculated to lay down precedents in this ery case by which the introduc tion of evidence might be controlled, and the government was forced to vary slightly its direction of attack. To establish a conspiracy among the defendants is the duty of the United States attorney, al the defense wanted to be very careful that all the evidence was presented properly. The session closed at six o'clock with the government interrogating Ramon P. De Negri, its first witness, who was called to show that he had pur chased the arms from the Phelps Dodge and Douglas Hardware com pany's stores. After one objection, the jury was excused while counsel debated the issue hotly. The result of the debate was a small victory for the defense, in that it compelled the prosecution to ap proach the case from another angle. The attempt to gain from De Negri a statement as to a conversation ho held with J. U. Perez, a fellow con spirator after the witness had ar ranged the purchase of cartridges from Manager Fisher of the Douglas Hardware company was what precipi tated the argument. It was necessary for the government to forego the in formation as his honor sustained the defense on the ground that in a con spiracy case, what one conspirator says to another prior to the intro duction of evidence showing a con spiracy existed was not proper evi dence, and could not be introduced against a third conspirator, who was not present. Morrison immediately changed his tactics, relinquished his quest of in formation on the phone conversation between Perez and De Negri and be gan eliciting evidence regarding tho actual movements of these two.
