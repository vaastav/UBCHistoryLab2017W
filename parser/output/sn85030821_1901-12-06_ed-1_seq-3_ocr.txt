THE GOODLAKI) EEPUBLIC: FEIDAY, DECEMBEE 0, 1801. r- h m :t H W 1-3 i ,3 il 1 Sends His First Annual Message to the Senate ' and House of Representatives HAKES RECOMMENDATIONS Eulogies the Late President McKinley and Advocates Stern Measure! for Anarchists Proposes Trust Legislation Along: the Lines of Pub licity Favors Government Construction of Irrigation Works Urges Construction of Isthmian Canal and Laying of Pa cific Cable Asks Legislation for the Colonies and Reciprocity for Cuba "Would Esclude Chinese The following la a comprehensive sum mary of President Roosevelt's message to congress: The president begins his first annual communication with an official announce ment of the death of the late President McKinley, and a eulogy of his former chief is which he says: "It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinley's death he was the most widely-loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter ani mosities incident to public life. His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the weetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close asso ciates. To a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affec tions and home virtues which are all important in the makeup of national character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct In the most sacred and Intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him, for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could fail to respect him who knr htm in public or private life. The defenders of those mur derous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exer cised for political ends inveigh against wealth and Irresponsible power. But for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged. "The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days while the president yet hovered between life and death. At last the Ught wu stilled in the kindly eyes, and the breath went from the lips that even In mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends and of unfaltering trust In the will of the Most High. Such a death crowning the glory of such a life leaves .us with infinite sorrow, but with such pride in what he had accomplished and in his own personal character that we feel the blow not as struck at him, but as struck at the nation. We mourn a good and great president who is dead, but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death." In the same connection he makes strong recommendations as to how the nation should deal with anarchy. He urges that the preaching or teaching of anarchy be not permitted, and requests congress to enact legislation that will prevent anarchists from foreign countries landing upon our shores. He would also have the federal courts given Jurisdiction over any man who kills, or attempts to kill, the president of the country, or any person who is in line for succession to the presidency. He has no fear, however, that the country will ever fall into an archy. "The federal courts should be given Jur isdiction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law is in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our in stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade, for it is of far blacker Infamy than either. It should be eo declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dealing with the crime." The Trusts. The president sees cause for congratu lation for the nation in the business condi tions of the present, but sees in the "tre mendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever ac celerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century" a serious social problem for the present and future. He does not believe that the old laws and old customs are sufficient to regulate the ac cumulation and distribution of wealth of the present time. He does not attribute the creation of great corporate fortunes to ins existence 01 a protective tarirr. nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world, op erating In other countries as they operate In our own." In this connection he says: "The process has aroused much antago nism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have frown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never be fore has the average man. the wage worker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in this country and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of weailh. yet it remains true that a for tune accumulated in legitimate buir.e c,aih bt accumulated by the person spe cially benefited only on condition of con- "'"-e. itwmc ii.ciurniai uer.ents upon fcieau piucs as ine rewards of success " xsuiwnno ne realizes existing condl- ?. -7.eb2Ut Up ur cmmerce and driven our railroads across the continent have done great rood to . our people, and without them the material development of which we are so Justly proud could never have taken place. Moreover, we should recog f 1ie',te ,n?mense importance to this ma terial development of leaving as unham pered as is compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom the success of business operation inevitably rest3. The slightest study of business conditions will stKfv or,... capable of forming a Judgment that the personal equation is the most Important factor in a business, operation: that the business ability of the man at the head of any business concern, big or little, is usual ly the factor which fixes the gulf between striking success and hopeless failure." Another reason for caution In trust legis lation which he gives "is to be found in the international commercial conditions of to day. The same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors ia Inter national commercial competition. Busi ness concerns which have the largest mans at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturallv those which take the lead In the strife for com mercial supremacy among the nations of the world. America has only Just bgun to-assume that commanding position in the international business World which we believa will mere and more be h;rs.

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. Inevitably endangers the Interests of all. The fundamental rule in our national life, the rule which underlies all others, is that on the whele and In the long run we shall go up or down together. There are excep tions, and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more and in times of adversi ty some will suffer far more than others; but, speaking generally, a period of good times means that all share more or less in them, and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or less degree." He points to the fact that In the past "the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally oppos ing In dealing with business Interests for the government to undertake by crude and ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far-reaching na tional disaster that it would be prefer able to undertake nothing at alL The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is prac ticable to apply remedies." Remedies for the Trust Evil. But while he says the above is true, he yet sees many evils for which there should be remedies provided. Of these evils the Judgment this conviction is right." As a remedy for these evils he says: 'The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial com binations is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the Interest of the publie the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings oX the great corporations engaged in inter state business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further remedies Are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of- law and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete knowledge which may be made public i to tne world. "Artificial bodies, such as corporations and Joint stock or other associations de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate Information as to their operations should be made public regu larly at reasonable intervals." "The large corporations. commonly called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them, and as no state haa any exclusive interest In or power over their acts it has in practice proved im possible to get adequate regulatiom' through state action. Therefore in tk interest of the whole people the natlOB should, without interfering with the pow er of the states in the matter Itself, also assume power of supervision and regula tion over all corporations doing an inter state Dusiness. xnis is especially true i wnere tne corporation derives, a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency In its business. There would be no hardship in such supervision. Banks are subject to it. and in their case It is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed It is probable that supervision of corpora tions by the national government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over thm bv se conservative a state as Massachusetts ia order to produce excellent results." The president believes that it will bo possible to secure the needed remedies for the trust evil under th constitution as it now exists, but if congress thinks otherwise he recommend. that a c institu tional amendment be subm tted tnat will coi fer the povc necessary. In connection with th i-usts he rec ommends legislation creating a cabinet cf fictr. to b? known ss sic:etarv of :m n -"V 6 i,10" 3 ties woui-3 be to deal witn all ti'j-.xtlons concern r commerce, later and the mfchant marine. "Would Exclude the Chinese. The message comains a strong ncin nendation for tie reenactment at once of the present Chinese exclusion act, Ln which connection he says: 'la8r;v 4X6 hihlr Jo-day In the United Spates than ever before in our history and far higher than in any other coun try. The standard of living is lo higher than ever before. Every effort of ls lator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this conditloe of things and Its improvement wherever possible. Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should a'so be protected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country of any la borers brought over by contract or of those who corning freely, yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level I regard It as necessary, with this end ln view, to reenact immediately te law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary in or der to make its enforcement entirely ef-. fective." an law. from competing with the prison labor of another state, and also that the govern ment cease being a party to this competi tion by not purchasing soods made either vy convici iiDor or mat in which women and children are caused to work excessive hours or at night. In the labor unions of the present he sees much that is good. In which connection he says : v'Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wageworkers when managed with forethought and when they combine in sistence upon their owi rights with law abiding respect for the right3 of others The display of these qualities In such bedies is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselv-s. Finally there must also ln many eases be action by the government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of alL Under our constitution there is much more scope for such action by the state and the municipality than by the nation But cn points such as those touched on above the national government can act. wnn an is s.ia ana aone, the rule of he so works no outside help can avail Ph.Pf 1c nvtr ran fal'7at ni hf-i 11 n SIntiX! orlrnfriceonfi ! hm?' thpripior 'recti thTate thgrea? grhtt;?C&0&Oll j SorfThT hC trusts. are in certain of their features and Tt? h,'mSh-I.

To be permanently ef fective ail must always tike the form c helping a man to help himself, and we can all best help ourselves by joining to gether In the work that Is of common In terest to all." Tto Immicratiem Laws. He pronounces our present lmmirratlon laws unsatisfactory. Ia which connection he says "we need every hone.it and ef ficient immigrant fitted to became an American citizen, every immigrant who comes here to stay, who brings hsre a strong body, a good head and a resolute purpose to dc his duty well In. every way and to bring up nis children as law-abiding, God-f taring members of the community." But he says: "There fhould be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working a threefold improvement over our present system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persona who are known to be believers in anarchistic prin ciples or members of anarchistic socie ties, but also all persons who are of low moral tendency or of unsavory repu tation. This means that we should re Quire a more thorough system of inspec-I'f-n abroad and a more rlg'd system of examination at our immigration ports, the fo.mer being especially necessary. "The second object of a proper immi gration law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory edu cational test some intelligent capacity to appreciate American institutions and act I sanely as American citizens. This would j r.ot keep out all anarchists, for many of J them belong to the intelligent criminal class, but it would do v. hat is also in point I that is, tend to decrease the sum of ig- r.orance so potent in producing the envy, ' suspicion, malignant passion and hatred J of order out of which anarchistic senti ment inevitably springs. Finally all per sons should be excluced who are below a certalr standard or" economic fitness to enter our industria1 field as competitors with American labor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn labor and the resull.'rg competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness In American industrial 1'fe. end it would dry uo the springs of the pestilential social cond.tions In our greru cities where an archistic organize tjcr have their great est possibility of growth." The Tariff. The president does net desire any change in the present tariff schedule except where such may be made in reciprocity treaties and recommends the adoption of reciproc ity treaties and the general policy of reci procity as a means of opening the doors of foreign nations to our commerce, in which connection he says: "Every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of economic legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper snouia De avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run directly or indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as pos sible be secured by so arranging our tar iff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. "The natural line cf development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound hasis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition. "I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor." The 31erchant Marine. The president pronounces cur merchant marine "discreditable to us as a nation and Insignificant to that of other nations which we overtoil in other forms of business." ! and says we "bhou'.c r.ot longer submit to ! conditions under which cr.ly a trifling por tion of our great commerce is carried In our own ships. Of this he says: "To remedy this state cf things would not merely serve to buile? up our shipping in terests, but it wou!I ;!so result in benefit to all who are interested in the penna : nent establishment f i wden market fo ; American products ard would provide a. ' auxiliary fcrce for ihe ravy. Ships work 1 for ih-?i"r own countries just as raiiroad I work for their terminal points. Shipping j lints. If established to the principal coun tries with v.bich we have lt.i :irgs. wou.d be of political a? wr !! as commercial ben efit. From every startl point it is unwise fcr the United Stale.- :o continue to rely upon the ships of competing na tions for the distribution of on. goods. It should be made advantageous to carry American goods in American built ships." His recommendation on this subject is only that "our government should t3ke such action as will remedy these inequali ties. The American merchant marine should be restored to th ocean." Finance. Under this heading the president recom mends such legislation as will better safe guard against the dtrerplng ir.f.uences of commercial crises ard financial panics and such as will make tfce currency of the country more responsive to the demands of domestic trade and commerce. He points out the lact tht the receipts from duties -jh Imports ard internal taxes exceed the- exptrc turcs cf the govern ment, but counsels, against reducing the revenues sr that there wl.! b- the pessi Cillty cf a deficit. "But after providing against any such contingency .x.ears shculd be adopted which will brirg the revenues mere nearly within the limit of our actual needs." He urges the necessity for strict economy in expenditures, but that "our r.atlona'l needs forbid us to be niggardly in the mat ter of providing whatever is actually nec essary to our well-being." Inter-State Commerce. He points to defects in the interstate commerce law. and recommends amend ments to correct them, ln which connection he says: "Those who complain of the management of the railways allege that established rates are not maintained, that re bates and similar devices are habitually resorted to. that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper, that they drive out of business the smaller competitor, that while many rates are too low many others are excessive and that gross preferences are made affecting both localities and commodities. Upon the oth er hand, the railways assert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving car riers of that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to estab lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates. The act should be amended. Tne rail way is a public servant- Its rates should b Just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to It that within its Jurisdiction this Is so and should provide a speedy. Inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblocd of this nation Cows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies." Agricultural Interests. The president cites the forest legislation of the past nd the great good cf forest preserves to the people, and says they will inevitably be ef still greater value. Con- , tir.uir-g. he says: "At present the protection cf the forest reserves rests with the general land oce, j the mapping ar.d description of thsir tlra- j ber with the United States geological sur- I . vey and the preparation of plans for their for servatlve use with the bureau cf for- 1 estrv. which Is also charged with the sren- erai advancement cf rractical forestry In te United States. Thsse varicus func t4ons should be united in the buriu cf forestry, tc which tfiey properly be; org. prasent diffusion of responsibility is t-zd lrr every ta.r.drc'-nfc- It prevents hit elective eoe-T-ration betwp the rcv?mrr.it the men who uti tfce .z. riuit sar. 'lift scientific bureaus generally should be rut under the department cf agriculture. The president should h-ave by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest re serves to the department of agriculture. He already has "suchbower in the case of birds needed by the departments of war and the navy." Irrigation. Irrigation la connection with the waste lands of the west is a qsestlen to which the president gives considerable attention, and makes strong recommendations for government assistance In reclaiming the waste lands by assisting la their irriga tion and the control of vittr rights wher ever that is possible, and of this he says: "In the arid region It Is water. not land, which measures production. The westers half of the United States would sustain a country to-day If the waters that now run 10 waste were saved and used lor lrnga tloru The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States. "la cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and ier are coming back, and hundreds of persons, especially from the immediate neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping. Some at least of the forest reserves should afford per petual protection to the native fauna and Cora. M.fe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing; wild animals of the larger kinds and free camping grounds for the ever-Increasing numbers f men and wom en who have learned to find rest, health and recreation in the tplecdid f oresU and flower-clac? meadows of our mountain. The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the us-e and benefit of our peo ple as a wholo and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few." "The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are nec essary to equalize the Cow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construc tion has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the in- dividual states acting alone. Far-reaching interstate problems are Involved, and the resources of single states would often be Inadequate. It la properly a .national function, at least ln some of its features. It is as right for the nation! government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rlverg and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an en largement of our present policy of river control under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams. "The government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose Is to regulate the Cow of streams the water should be turned freely Into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow. "The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every porUon of cies will stimulate Industrial production, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume the larger food sup plies and effectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture. In deed, the products of irrigation will bo consumed chiefly in upbuilding local cen ters of mining and other Industries which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as a whole will profit, for successful homemaklng is but another name for the upbuilding ci the nation." He counsels against attempting too much at the beginning, bu advises that we let experience on a small plan teach the pos sibilities of greater undertakings- He also cites the conditions under which the set tlers f the west ere attempting to build homes on these arid lands, and says: "The security and value of the homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water, but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered in ordinary suits- at law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid states have failed, to provide for the certain and Just division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish rights to water ln excess of actual uses or ne cessities, and many streams have already pasted into private ownership or a control equivalent to ownership. "Whoever control a stream practically controls the land it renders productive, and the doctrine of private ownership cf water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrcr.tr. The recognition of such ownership, which has been per- j mitted to grow up in the arid regloas. should give w ay to a more enlightened and j larger recognition of h rirhts of the pub- ; lie in the contrr.l arc ci?:josal of the pub- ' lie water supplies. Law founded upon j conditions obtr.ining in humid region, where water is too abundant to justify ' hoarding It. have no proper application ln ! a dry country. "In the arid states the only right to water i which shrmid be rfrocr.lzeii !s that of n In irrigation this r'.rht should attach to . the land reclaimed in: be inseparable therefrom. Gr-ntlr perpetual water ' rights to other than users without compensation to th nubile is opn to all 1 tne ojectior..- wn:cr r-TP-V to g:v:r g away perpetual franchises to the- public utili- , ties of the cittes. A few of the western j states have already recozT.Izrd this and have incorporated in their constitutions : the doctrine of perpetual state ownership of water." The Colon I e. Considerable attention is riven the col onies, and especially the Philippines. This section of the message begins by citing the needs cf Hawaii and Porto Rico, of which he says: "In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional American lines. We do not wish a reg:on of large estates tilled by cheap labor. We wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the Islands should be shaped with this end In view. The well being of the average homenaktr must afford the true test of the healthy devel opment of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system." Of Porto P.lco he says the island is thriv ing as never before, and is being adminis tered efficiently and honestly. He deems no legislation necessary except that con cerning the public lands of the island. He calls attention to thefact that in Cuba the independent government cf the island will soon be in control, and ln the same connection urges strongly the need of reciprocal trade relations with the new nation, upon which subject he says: "In the case cf Cuba there are weighty reasons of morality and of national inter est why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnest ly ark your attention to the wisdom. Indeed to the vital teed, of providing for a sub stantial reduction ln the tariff duties on Cuban Imports into the United States. Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired that she ehould stand ln Inter national matters in closer and more friend ly relations with us than with any ether power, and we are bound by every consid eration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of her mat-rial well being." For the Philippines he recommends much in the way of legislation, but again coun sels caution that we go neither too far nor with too great haste. He says: "We hepe to make our administration of the islands honorable to our nation by making it of the highest benefij to the Filipinos themselves, and as an earnest of what we intend to do we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained ln the Philippines than ever before ln their his tory." He says we do not desire to do for the Islanders "merely what has elsewhere been dene for tropic peoples by even tfce test foreign governments. We hope to da for them what has never before been done for any people of the trcpics to make them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really free nations." But the Idea of the president is that we cannot leave the islands at this time, of which he says: "To leave the Island at this time would mean that they would fall Into a welter of murderous 'anarchy. Such a desertion cf duty on our part would be a erir; against humanity." But he beiieve? sufficient pragrers has been made al-mg the lines under which we have bn working in the is'.ar.i to war rant us ln passing new le-islation. b-jt in ' this cC'T.reciion he urj-e the need of cau- '. tion. 21s believes the time has ccrae when the Industries cf which the l5!anls trs capable should be encouraged by granti-j franchises fcr their develcrerl, and cf this he cays: "Not!-'"r b?tt-,r cn be frr tie ! iii-li tin tc ir. trc J uce u.r tr.z.' our country. Just as the settlement of the l i"Le,, v, . T .

Ir.e connection between Idleness and mischief ts proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative wcrk is ene cf the surest preventives cf war. Of courw to business can wlil go Into the r'hilipplaes unless It is to his interest to do so, and It is Immensely xo the interest cf tee isiini j that h shouid go In. It is therefore necessary that the congress should pais laws by which the resources ef the l&iands can be developed, so that franchises (for limited terms cf years) can be granted to coasar.ies doing business is, them and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men of every kind. "Not to permit this It to do a wronr to the Philippines. The franchises must be gulaticr.9 which wl.l r'- Islands against any kind of improper ex ploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the Islands must be deveicped. and the capital willing to develop It must be given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real factor ia the development of every region over which our Cag has fiown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, mining, banking, currency, homesteads and the use ar.d ownership of the lands and timber. These low? will give free play to Industrial enterprise, and the commercial development which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of cur desire to aid them." The construction of a Pacific cable is also urged, either that the government lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and the Philippines, or that an arrangement be made by which the advantages ac cruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a private cable company. This he deems necessary - for both commercial, political and military considerations. The Iitkmlan Canal. He calls attention to the need of an isthmian canal, and says: "Its importance to the nation is by no means limited merely to us material el fects upon our business prosperity, and yet with a view to these etttcts alone it would be to the last degree important for us Immediately to begin it. N hile its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Pacific coast and the gulf and south Atlantic states. It would also greatly benefit other sections. It is emphatically a work which it is for the Interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible; it is one of those great works which only a gTeat nation can undertake with pros pects of success and which when done are not only permanent assets in the na tion's material interests, but standing monuments to its constructive ability." Of th new treaty recently concluded with England he says: "I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotia tions on this subject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides In a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will ar.d re spect, have resulted in my being able to that it has ever aked in connection with the canal. In this treaty the cid Claytcn Bulwer treaty, so long reccgr.lred as in adequate to supply the base for the con struction ar.d maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, ia abrogated. It spe cially provides that the United States alone shell do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and snail regulate its neutral use by all nations cn terms of equality without the guarantee or interference of any outside nation from any quar ter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the senate, and if ap proved the congress can then proceed to give effect to tne advantages it secures us by providing for the building of the eacal." The Moiroe Doctrine. The president sets forth the objects of the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit In which it has been re?eived by other countries, and in connection with it says this nation has not the slightest desire to acquire any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors, and cites our atti tude toward Cuba as a guarantee of our good faith. He says also that "this doctrine has nothing to do with the com mercial relations of any American power save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it desire." That "we do not ask for any exclusive commercial treaty with any other American state." He says of this: "The Monroe doctrine should bo the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of tho two Americas as it is of the United States. Just TS years have passed since President Monroe ln his annual message anno-.ir.red that "the American continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any nuro;e.in power. In other words, the f'-,.r'p ;octrlne is a declaration that thre must be no terri torial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any Ameri can power on American soil. It is in no- TeLs intended as hostile to any nation ln tne old world. Still .s i :t intended to Pve cover to any asrgrc-s-:on ry one new world power at the expanse of any other, It is simply a step. rn-! n long step, to- wardassuring the universal race of the world by securing the uossibility of per- i traarent peace on this hemisphere." j The Xnvy. The president urges the continued up building of the navy as a means cf per ferming our international duties as well as a protection and safeguard for our inter- ; national rights. He uri;cs that our place 1 as a first-class power r.-ces-sitates the building and malr.tenar.ee of a navy ia keeping with our place among the naticLo ef the world, ar.d says: "So far from being !r. ar.y w.y a provo cation to war. an ar;';u.ite end highly trained navy is the b-r ci:i-.rar.tee against war. the cheapest and rr .j.t fffective peaco insurance. The cost 1 1 huildir. and main taining such a navy rr presents the very lightest premium for ir.-urirg peace which this nation can rofjlllv p.y." He recommenis hr;h th construction of more ships unl tr.- . d lition of more officers and men as absolutely necessary, and says: "There should b no cessation ln the work of completing our ravy. So far in genuity has been ivho'iy unable to devise a substitute for the greit wr craft whoso hammering guns beat ;;;t the mastery of the high seas. It is ur.cafe and unwise not to provide this y?r for several addi tional battleship ?nd hf ivy armored cruisers, with auxiliary ana lighter craft In proportion. For the exact number and character I refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy. But there Is some thing we nefl even more than additional shifs, and this is additional officers an4 men. To provide battleships and cruis ers and then lay them up. with the ex pectation of leaving them unmanned un til they are needed In actual war. would Tfce worse than folly. It would be a crime against the nation. "To send eny warship against a compe tent enemy unless those aboard it have been trained by years of actual sea serv ice, including incessant gunnery prac tice, would be to Invite not merely dis aster, but the bitterest shame and humil iation. Four thousand additional sea men and a thousand additional marines should be provided, and an increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annap olis. There is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious ard unmean ing title of 'naval cadf should be abol ished: the title of midshipman.' full of histeric association, should be restored. "We now have 17 battleships appropri ated for. of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining eight will be ready ln from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to f.ght'them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by ihe tlm they are com missioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons. and the best weapons are useless save in the hands cf rr.trx who know how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled un der a thorough and weil-planned system Of proirressive Instruction, while the re cruiting must be carr'i on with still greater viccr. Cvcry eTTort must be made to exact the main function cf the officer the esmmand of men. The leading grad uates cf the naval academy iculd ba a t'.sned to the combatant branches, the line and marines." The Array.

Justice to the veterans cf tn ctvii war who are sti! in the army wcuil , seem to require that in the matter cf re tirements they be given by law the same ' privileges accorded to their ccrzrsdts la : the navy." I Another recommendation which the pres I ident makes ia connection with the iLrrry Is lor the recuctlon of tne "paper wersr cf the service, known to the public as "red tape." Of this h rays: "Every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly increasing state of efheieccy. When on actual service, to work save that circtly In the line cf such service should be required. The paper work in the army, as in the nary, should be greatly reduced. What is needed Is proved power of command and capacity to work well in the Celd. Constant ce.ro is necessary to prevent dry rot is the transportation and commissary depart ments." He also urges the enactment of legis lation in connection with the militia and national guard forces of the nation that they may be better fitted for active serv ice in time of war. and says: "Our militia law Is obsolete and worth less. The organisation and armament of the national guard of the several states, which are treated as militia in the ap propriations bv the congress, should be made identical with those provided fcr the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the guard In time of war should be carefully defined and a system estab lished by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces shouid be prescrlhed m advance. It is ut terly impossible ln the excitement and haste of imper.dir.r war to do this satis factorily if the arrangements have not seen mass long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilising in the first volunteer organizations called out the training of those citizens who have al ready had experience under arms, and especially for the selection in advance of j the officers of any force which may bo raised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the outbreak of war." He praises the veterans of the civil war. the war with Spain and those who have rendered the nation valiant service in the Indian uprisings of the west and ln the Philippines, and counsels continued lib erality tn the nation's dealing with thera, The Civil Service. lie recommends the enactment of legis lation that will place under the rulings of the merit system many classes of em ployes not now governed by it. His rec ommendation for this Is as follows: "I recommend the passage of a lav which will extend the classified service to the District of Columbia or will at least enable the president thus to extend It. In my Judgment all laws providing for the. temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the civil servico law." He also wishes the merit system to ob tain in the government service in tho eolonies. and says: "Not an office should be filled in tho Philippines or Porto Rleo with any regard to the man's partisan affiliations or serv ices, with any regard to the political, so cial or personal influence which he may have at his command. In short, heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the man's own character and capacity and the needs of the service. "The administration of these island should be as wholly free from the sus picion of partisan politics as the admin istration of the army and navy. All that we aex rrom tne puMic servant ln the Philippines or Porto Rico is that he re flect honor on his country by the way la which he makes that country's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come un der it. This is all that we should ak. and we cannot afford to be content with less." Other Recommendations. Among other recommendations which tho president makes are those asking fcr leg islation that will irr.provs tho consular serv ice along lines oub.ir.ed in bills introduced at previous sessions; snd he says that: "It Is true that the service is now ln tho main efficient, but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth ln the bills here tofore submitted to the congress cn this subject are enacted Into law." He believes the time has arrived when the Indian should cease to be treated as a member of a tribe, but as sn individual, and recommends breaking up the tribal fuzs. putting a stop to the Ir-dls-eriminste permission to Indians to lease their allot ments and stopping the rstioo system. He recommends also the establishment of an industrial educational system, ar.d an en deravor to encourage the Indians to become cattla raisers rattier than arrie;lturista where their lande are unsulted to tie latter. He recommends liberal appropriations for tho Louisiana Purchase exposition and an PProprlstion covering expenses incurred by the Charleston exposition in removing government exhibits from the Buffalo ex position to that at Charleston. Another of hit recommendations is for a permanent cestui bureau, as it would in sure better, cheaper and more satisfactory work in the interest cf business, statistics, economic and social science. The Postal Service. He calls attention to the growth of tho postal system and to the fact that the an nual deficit In this department of the gov ernment service has been reduced to the small rum of 12.S15.T27. This, he says, could further be increased and possibly a surplus shown but for the fact that many publi cations are now securing the pound rate as second-class mall matter which are not entitled to the same under the law. Of this be says: The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well-understood abuses which have grown In con nection with second-class mall matter. The extent of this burden appears when It is stated that, while the second-class mat ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the roan, it paid for the last fiscal year only J4.Il.fi5 cf the aggregate costal revenue of Jlll.C31.li2. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the large less thus entailed and which was fixed by tho congress with the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of puMic information, were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no Just exception could b-e taken. That expense would be the recognized scl accepted cost ef a liberal public policy de liberately adopted for a Justifiable end. But muea of tho matter which enjoys tho privileged rate H wholly outside of tho intent of the law and has secured s amis sion only through s-n evasion of its re quirement or through lax construction. The proportion cf such wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume cf second class mall. If it be only cae-third or one quarter, the magnitude cf the burden is apparent. The post otfice department has now undertaken to remove tho abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and it should be sustained la its effort." The Chinese Diae-nltlee. He calls attention to the satisfactory settlement of the Chinese difUculties of last year, and this nation's part in tho settlement, and says pro-rUicns have been made for insuring the future safety sf the feceim representatives. Of th promises made by China he says: Tho Chinese government has agreed to participate financially in the wcrk of bet tering the water approaches to Shanghai and to Tientsin, the centers of foreim trade in central and northern Chins, axd an lntema.ticr.il conservancy beard, la which the Chinese government is largely represented, has been provided for the improvement cf the Shanghai river and the coatrol of Its caviraticn. In the tarns line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been absented to fcr the purpose cf substitct in rpecific for ad valorem duties, aid su. exp-ert hs b-een sent abroad cn the part cf the United States to assist in this work.
