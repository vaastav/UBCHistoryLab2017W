%OMOGRAPHY OF THE TERR*TO IMAL COUNCIL. Lewiston, December 9'th, 1864 Ebrroa World : In ft former communication Ï wrote you some facts in relation to the 'membersof the Lowef House of tlte Legisla ture, from which you could obtakria homo graphic chart. I now ^end you a similar 'account of the members of the Council, from which yöu will see that, of the three tiiembers holding over, two are Democrats. The Ooiin* dl did itself considerable credit in deciding ' the contested election case on its merits ; that ' is, provided there was bo other *tnotive than ■to do justice—which l am not yet prepared * to give them. * HCX. S. B. DILLKY, Representing Alturas and Oneida counties in the Council, is a native of Ohio:; aged 31 : merchant by profession ; single; been ; in the Territory two .years—on this Coast, two years ; 'Douglas Democrat. He is one of the most active members öf that btanch of the Legis lature. He-is an accomplished presiding offi • çer, and is often called to the Chair when in ' Committee of the Whole. He is a very esti mable gentleman, and an able representative. Term expires in<1866. HOX. 

JOHN CUMMINS, President,'of the Council, and representing Owyhee county, is the youngest man in either \House. Native of Indiana; 26 years of age; unmarried; attorney; in the Territory one . year, and on this coast eleven years; Union. Cummins has served one term in the Oregon ^Legislature. Has experience enough, if he htd force of character and firmness to rise ubove petty party influences on matters of a general nature even, to make a good repre-. sedative. He is very attentive to his duties, *tmt I think allows himself to be controlled by DOCTOR EPHRAIM SMITH, 'One of the mis-represeutatives in the Council from Boise county. The said Doctor E , ''Smith opposes everything that lodk-s to the interest of any jme, unless he is aboli tionist, no difference of what importance it ' may be to the people at large. Narrow mind ed, egotistic himself, he traduces, by turns, both friends and foes, as he may be behind 1 heir backs. Thank God, he is about played ■ out; as this session is the last he will get. He (Smith) is a native of Pennsy mnia, aged 43 ; physician by profession ; i3 married ; has been in this Territory three years and on the 'coast fifteen. Smith's term expires 1865— 'Cummins' I860. HON. JOSEPH MILLER, 'Of Boise county, is a little more liberal, but •he could not bring himself up sufficiently to 'vote for the Funding bill for Boise county. ; He is devoting considerable labor on the Code, 'as - one of the Joiut Code Committee. His 'race* politically, is about run, and I don't 'think the Boise county people will regret it. Hie is the leader of his side of the house in all debates. Miller's term expires 1865. HON. E. B. WATERBURY, Of Fez Perce, is a whole-souled, good natured individual—very tenacious about anything that relates to the interests of his section of the Territory. He is a native of Connecticut —aged 39; auctioneer; unmarried; three .wears in the Territory and same on the coast; 'Democrat, politically. Term expires 1865. HON. S. S. KENN, Is the oldest member in the Council—like Mr. \Waterbury, is an easy, good natured soul ; is considerable of a wit withal. He takes a leading part in all the debates on big side of the bouse, and is an able debater and ener •getic Democrat, and a good legislator. He is n native of Connecticut—aged 44 ; miner ; is single ; been in the Territory two years and .«»n the coast 14years; represents Idaho coun ty—term expires 1866. \ 110N. STANFORD CAPPS, Is a young man, considerable of a rustler very conservative, but, like all the other members on this side of the Territory, is very sensi ive/m regard to the interests of this section. He is a native of Missouri, aged 39. Is a miner by profession ; is unmarried ; has been ia the Territory four years, and on the -cca.st seventeen. His term expires iu 1865. lie was electod on the Union ticket by Sho shone county, that only polled 120 votes at tue last election. Shoshone county, under the present apportionment, with its 120 votes, has one half the present representation in the Council that Boise eounty has. On that basis Boise-county would be entitled to sixty Gouneilmen. This completes the description of the Council members. Nearly all of them hail from the active pursuits of life, only four professional ruen appealing in the list; and 'one of them, at least, a merely a pretender— the aforesaid Ephraim. The Legislature, as it now stands, is com posed of twenty members on joint ballot, eleven Democrats and nine Republicans. It i 3 the first body of that political complexion, 1 believe, that has met in any State or Terri •tory for some years." 

WHAT HAS BKEN'ÇOS® There was quite sharp fight iiV.the Council op 'the Memorial to Congress to fbe Territory, but it was finally defeated;— a ^ s0 <>u the Capital bill, in the same body, which ,p iB-ed. On the passage of this bill, all llj e members lrom the northern portion of Territory presented their protest, and it v* - * 3 spread upon the journals. 1 It wa3 afterward presented in the House, arid bn motion of Mr. Pierce, they were allowéd to spread it upon the journal of that body. The Lewistonians feel very blue over it generally, and would favor Idaho City next year as against Boise City. In fact thé entire delegation from this side of the Territory, in both Houses, voted for Mr. Pierce's proposition, as reported by the Committee, to Jeave the question to a vote of t^e people at the next general election ; but* was defeated by a majority of one in each House. The only bill of importance yet passed by bo'ihHouses, is the Specific Contract Law., the Capital bill, a Common School .L:sw, and a bill for the Protection of Settlers cm the Public Lands. The House has passed about twenty-five House bills, and about ten Coun cil bills ; and the Council about ten Council bills, and two House bills. The GounciL neglect everything emanating from the As sembly, unless it is a pet measure-of some of the members, or their friends, that they get some member to introduce. 'Whether the Governor signs the Specific Contract Act, or' not, it can be passed over his veto by a two thirds vote. I will send you a certified copy as soon as it can be.obtaioed. fA copy of the bill, as approved by the Governor, appears dn another column.—-E d.] A Looser 'On. * The Presidents Message. The annual message of the President was delivered at the opening of »Congress on the first Monday-of December. It is one of Mr. Lincoln's own documente. 'Evidently he employed no Seward to write tit for him:— His papers are remarkable documents, and years hence will be looked upon with won dering awe, and many secret thanksgivings by readers that they did not happen to livo in an age so dark and barbarous.. A large portion.of the document .is devoted to foreign relations. It is remarkable, how ever, that little or nothing is said of any of of the leading powers of Europe, but it stead >we are supplied with-the minu test de tails of our relations with -Liberia^»Costa Rica, San Salvador, Egypt, Hayti, and many other noted and influential- nations of the same size. We are informed that the sym pathisers of these powers,—and including Hayti—are with the United States and '^con stantly expressed." The African Republic, Liberia, we are told "gives us a pleasing view." The proposed overland telegraph between America and Eufope, via Behring Straits has been undertaken by some Americans, and the idea of an oceanic tele graph across the Atlantic is renewed. The Brazilian difficulty is covered up by a few, words .about " constant vigilence and just spirit." ' The President thinks foreigners makegood soldiers, and are very convenient to have around when the New Englanders shirk. He says : ' , I regard our emigrants as one of the prin cipal replenishing streams whichjare appoint ed by^ Providence to repair the ravages of in ternal war and its wastes of national strength and health. Aft that is necessary is to se cure the flow of that stream in its present fulness, and to that end the Government must in every way, make It manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involun tary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lots in our country. A brief statement of the finances is given based upon the report of the Secretary of the Treasury six monih3 ago. The public debt he thinks very substantial "property." He says : Tbe public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books of the treasury, amount to $174,969,048*949. Probably should the war continue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from $500,000,000. Held «s it is for the most part by our own people, it bas become a substan tial branch 'of national though private pro perty. The philosophy of the foregoing is sumed up iu one of those immortal maxims which already rival Socrates and Ben Franklin : "Men readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe themselves." The present number of army invalids now on the pension list 22,767 ; 22,198 widows, orphans and mothers have been placed ou the army rolls. Four nundred and fifty millions were paid during the year ending in June, for pensions. 1 Of the. war, he congratulates the public that the "armies have steadily advanced lib erating (?) tbe States in the rear so th^ Ken tucky, Missouri, and other States have pro duced good crops." lie rejoices that "important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of moulding society for durability iu the Union." What tbe agency for the mould ing is, does not appear. He recommends the general abolition of slavery wherever it can be reached—and also Increased taxation. lie says he finds relief from his melancholy, in the fact, that a majori ty of the men who entered the army are still alive. The election is declared an evidence of the purpose of the people to maintain the Union, and apparently forgetting that, the right of the people to an election does cot come from him, says thatjn "awarding the people a fair opportunity" of showing their determin ation" in has been of great value to the na tional cause. lie is of the opinion that "no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader would result in any good." Speaking of the amnesty offered a year ago to such os would accept it, he threatens : "The dcor has, fora full year, been open to ail suclri as were not in a condition to make a free choice : that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still open to all, but the time may comp, and will come, when the public duty shall demand that it be clos ed, and that in lieu, more vigorous measures than heietoforeshall be adopted." After declaring his deteiruination to en force the emancipation proclamation, he states the terms of peace in the following closing words : "In stating a single condition tif peace, I mean simply to say that the warwill cease on Hip pant of the government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it."
