Railroad Company has made arrangements to build their road from Atchison to Topeka at once. Hurry that work up. It Is reported at Raleigh, N. C, that a resolution will be adopted by the Leg islature, looking to the immediate im peachment of Gov. Holden. One would think, from a careful peru sal o the local columns of the Topeka paper, that Uiey have what is called a "Musical Union" in that town. The next legislatures meet Tuesday, the 10th of January. Tho State Prin ter is to be elected on Tuesday the 17th, and the United States Senator on Tues day the 24th. Goldthwait has been elected U. S. Senator from Alabama. He is a Dem ocrat, and beat Warner, carpet-bagger, He Is an able lawyer, and has been a resident of Montgomery over 40 years. Col. James Blood, of Lawrence, is about to remove his woolen factory from that city to Burlingame. A large building is to be erected. That will be as good as a county seat for Burligame. Hon. J. IF. Prescott writes that the namo of the Representative elected in McPhcrsou county is not Geary, as heretofore reported. Rev. Ollof Olson is the namo of the successful candidate. Mr. Olson is a swede minister, was a delegate to tho republican State conven ion , and is a purifier of the first order Minister Motley writes that the Queen of Holland has tendered him the use of one of her elegant mansions at Hague in which to reside while finishing his History of the Netherlands. He has accepted, and will go there as soon as he can turn over his affairs at London to his Secretary of Legation. Here is what the New York Station, the ablest Journal in the country, says of Clarke : "Kansas has done well to send Judgo Lowe to Congress in place of Mr. Sidney Clarke, who has done more than any another representative to embarrass our Indian affairs and pro long border warfare and the reign of corruption. He hopes to be able to reach the Senate, but we trust in this he will be disappointed. We have often wondered why some improvement was not made upon the present barbarous way in shipping cat tle over our railroads. We note, with pleasure, tho following item from a New York dispatch : "A novelty ar rived at Communipaw in the shape of a palace stock car, with eighteen cattle from Chicago., Each animal occupied a separate stall at the head of which was a box supplied with food and water Among the many excellent notices of our daily, wo clip the following from the State Register at Iola : Enterprise. The Emporia Daily Xciet reaches our tablo regularly. The JVeir is tho only daily published In Southern Kansas except at Fort Scott We wish it the success it so richly mer its and while it is a great responsibility for Emporia to assume to support a dal ly, we trust that the peoplo throughout the entire Neosho Valley may encourage the enterprising proprietors to sustain the Daily Xewt. The official majorities on the Repub Mean State ticket as counted by the State Board of Canvassers are publish ed in the Topeka papers. They are as follows: Lowe, 19,176; Harvey, 20,167 ; Elder, 21,083; Smallwood, 21.157; Thoman, 21,316 ; Hays, 20,283 ; Williams, 20,815 ; McCarty, 22,616; Brewer, 22,028. The total vote cast for Governor was 60,134. This is pretty close to our prediction a couple of weeks before the election. It will be remembered by some that we said there would be 60,000 votes polled, and that out of this the Republican State ticket would have a majority of 20,000. The Burlington Patriot (Clarke) dis poses of the Senatorial question by sug gesting that the candidates start to Washington in a balloon, and the first one that arrives there to takes the place. This meets with the aprobation of the Lawrence Tribune, another Clarke or gan. These papers are really shrewd in thus discovering the fate of their candi date. If they are not singing, ' "Up in a balloon, boy, ' fn less than two months, we are mistak en. Bat they will have to "go It alone." "Anybody won't be with them. No doubt they would like to have company la their misery-'' THE 

PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. We had hoped to giro President Grant's message 'a es'.erday morning's issue, and tku hsTe laid it before oar rcbderi one d . if advance of any other paper, but tl nge and unexpected action of th ' graphic company, In refusing to gri- u the report at the price for which the Associated Press had contracted to furnish it to us, fro t rated this hope, and we must now be content to give merely a synopsis of this admirable State document. The President after congratulating the Country in the usual manner npon the blessings of peace- and prosperity that have been vouchsafed to us, de- votes a considerable portion of his mes- sage to questions that naturally grow out 0f the present War in Europe, and nizing the French Republic, while main- uining a sU-ict adherence to the laws of neutrality. The United States Govern- ment as soon as it learned that a Eepub- a m a f . w . lic had been proclaimed at Paris, and that the people of France were acquies cing in a change of Government, direct ed our Minister, by telegraph, to recog nize It, and to tender the President's congratulations, as well aa those of the people of the whole Country. The President says that while we should not intrude our institutions upon the inhab itants ot other countries, it is neverthe less but natural and right to manifest a lively interest in the spread of Ameri can political ideas, and to be especially rejoiced to see them adopted by so great and highly civilized a country as France, The President has a good deal to say about the War in Cuba, and explains that in he negotiations which he found necessary to open with the Government of Spain, in order to adopt measures for restraining injuries to citizens of the United States, for which the Spanish Government in Cuba were responsible, the United States simply claimed that in the future the rights secured to their citizens by treaty should be respected in Cuba. He hopes that this moderate and reasonable demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay, The San Domingo scheme is discuss ed exhaustlngly by the President. He believes it to have been a great mistake made by the Senate in refusing to rati fy the treaty for the annexation of the island of San Domingo. So soon as it becomes known that this Government has abandoned the project of annexa tion, a free port will be negotiated for by European Nations, in the bay, and a large commercial city will spring up, to which we will be tributary, without re ceivlug corresponding benefits. The people of San Domingo are anxious for annexation. They are a weak people, but inhabit one of the richest localities in the world. In regard to that very interesting and important question, the Alabama Claims, the President very pointedly expresses bis regret that uo adjustment, or any approach to an ad justment, has yet been made. For this state of the case England is chiefly re sponsible, for she has yet manifested no Krcat concern for a settlement of our claims. Canada and the British Gov ernment are also responsible for the en gendering of an unfriendly feeling be- tweeu the United States and Great Brit ain, in relation to the fisheries, and the President recommends that, if this un just and un-neighborly conduct be per sisted in, non-intercourse with Canada be proclaimed, and that Canandian ves sels be forbidden to enter the waters of the Uniled States. On the financial question the Presi dent shows that the currency of the country has appreciated fully one-fourth during tho last twelve months. He thinks, however, that the evils or a depreciated and fluctuating currency are very great and that it would be well by wise and prudent legisla tion to look to a policy which shall place our currency at par with gold at no distant day. The tax collect ed from the people has been reduced more than eighty millions per an num. By steadily pursuing the pres ent wise course there is no reason why the tax gatherers may not disappear en tirely. With reference to Revenue Reform, the President says : "Revenue reform if it means this, has my hearty support; if it involves a col lection of all the revenue for the sup port of government, for the payment of principal and interest or the public debt, pensions, &c, by directly taxing the people, then I am against revenue reform, and confidently believe thepeo pie are with me. If it means a failure to provide the necessary means to de fray all expenses of the government. and thereby the repudiation of the pub lic debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed to such kind of refenue reform Revenue reform has not been defined by any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which is to supply every man's wants without any costs or ef fort on his part. A true revenue re form cannot be made in a day, bnt must be the work of national legislation and of time. The President has a good deal to say on the land question, explaining the original operation of the homestead and pre-emption laws. He takes the sensi ble ground that the residuary of the ua tionai domain should be disposed of to actual settlers only, and to enterprises of actual and acknowledged Impor tance. Of the Civil Service Reform the Pres ident wisely says I rcspectfuM - ra'l vour attention to an abuce which l be remedied by this Congress ; it -. . form in the civil ser vice of the co -airy. I would advise that it co beyojd the clerks and em ployees who do not require the advice and consent of the seuato to make their appointmen s complete. I would have it govern not the tenure but the manner of mak'ng all appointments. There is no duty which to much embarrasses the executive as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed upon senators and repre sentatives as that of finding places for constituents. The elevation aud purin cation of the civil service or the gov ernmont will be hailed with approval by the whole people. The message taken all in all is a very able and wise state document. . The fol lowing is the concluding passage in the message : "In conclusion, I would ram up the policy of the administration to be, a thorough enforcement of every law : a faithful collection of the reven ne and econemy fn the disbursement of the same ; reduction or taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit ; reduction of taxation and tariff to be so arranged aa to afford the great est relief to the greatest number; hon est and fair dealings with ail other peo- le, to the end that war, with all its lighting consequences, may be avoid ed, but without surrendering any right or obligation due the United States ; a reform in the treatment of the Indiana and in the whole civil service of the couutry ; and, finally, in securing a pure and nntrammeled ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so just once at each election, without fear of molestation or proscription on ac count of his political faith, nativity or color. (Signed) U. S. Grant. Executive Mansion, Dec 5, 1870." Mrs. II. E. Holman, of Eureka, will be a candidate for Enrolling Clerk in the State Senate at the coming session. Mrs. H. has for two or three sessions been an assistant in that office, writes a splendid hand and Is in every way well qualified to perform the duties of the office.

OFPICAL REPORTS OF THE STATE IlilM SCHOOL I. PItI5CIPALS REPORT. (Concluded from our Jlr$t page.) CUAXGES IS THE FACCLTY. At the close of the first term, Miss Ellen Plumb, Principal of the Model School, resigned her position, for the purpose of opening a book store in Em poria. Tho vacancy caused by this res ignation was filled by the appointment of Miss Mary E. Baker, of Decatur, Illi nois, a teacher in the High School of that city. Miss Baker brought to her aid in the work of the Model School, a successful experience of some eight year's duration, first as Principal of the primary department of the Model School conuected with the State Normal Uni versity of Illinois, and subsequently, for the last five years, a teacher in the Decatur High School. Under her skill ful management the Model School has been led to occupy a high place in the estimation of the community. It gives me pleasure to add my own testimony in favor of the general excellence of this Department of the school. At the close of the quarter of the fis cal year, H. B. Norton, Associate Prin- ipal, resigned his place in the school, 111 health, coupled with a desire for an active, out-door life, constituted the mo tives inducing the resignation. Prof. R B. Dilwortb, of Leavenworth, accepting the invitation of the Board of Directors, has been performing the duties of the vacant position during the present, third term. Mr. Dilwortb, a graduate of Princeton College, N. J., is well known to the teachers of the State by reason of his successful labors in con nection with the Normal District Insti tutes, held for. the last two seasons by State Superintendent McVicar. He brings to his work in the Normal School a large amount of professional enthusi asm, broad and comprehensive scholar ship, an energy and willingness to work bounded onlv by the limitations of physical strength. I take the liberty to suggest that such arrangements be made as will insure to the institution the per manent services of Prof. Dilwortb. HISTORICAL SKETCH. Hon. C. V. Eskridge, in the winter of 1863, then a member of the House of Representatives, secured, by an act of tho Legislature, the location of tho State Normal School at Emporia, with an en dowment of about thirty-seven thou sand acres of land. The following ses sion he procured the passage of an act for the organization of the institution, and another, making an appropriation of one thousand dollars to open the school for the reception of students. A competent Board of Directors was ap pointed by the Governor. This Board appointed a meeting in the fall of 1864, but at the time it was to convene, came the imperative call for all able-bodied citizens to march to the border. It was not until January, 1865, that this or ganization was fully effected and the nlachincry put in motion. An Execu tive Committee, President, Secretary and Treasurer, were appointed. Rev. G. C. Morse, acting for, and by the au thority of, tho Board, started for the east in quest of a suitable person to take the position of Principal. After many difficulties and not a few discourage ments, Prof. L. B. Kellogg, a graduate of the Illinois Normal University, was Induced to take the place. On the 15th day of February, 1865, eighteen students fifteen more than were greeted by Father Pearce in Lex ington, when the first Normal School of Massachusetts was opened, and one less than President Hovey had at the beginning of the Illinois Normal Uni versity were gathered in a room be longing to the district school of Empor ia. With them was one teacher. Out of doors were all sorts of rumors con cerning an expected rebel invasion from Texas, and another ot Indians from the Territory. In doors, the eighteen stu dents had settees, borrowed from a neighboring church ; the teacher's seat was a chair borrowed from the county treasurer's offioe. There were two stoves in the room, no teacher's desk or other furniture, no text-books, maps, or other appliances. The parable of the sower was read, the Lord's Prayer re peated and so the Normal school of Kansas was opened. All were hopeful, and ere long, hard at work. Very soon the school room was well seated, and reasonably well furnished. The nam ber of students increased day by day, until there were forty-two ; and all were earnest, faithful and enthusiastic. The discipline was all that could be wished, and little said about it. The school was much visited and much talked about, at home and in the newspapers. The first term closed in J une, after a session of nineteen weeks. The Board of Visitors appointed by law to report their views with regard to the "condi tion, success and usefulness" of the in stitution, was in attendance throughout the examination, which lasted two days. Its discriminating and able report, pre sented to the legislature, did much to ward confirming public opinion in favor of the school. Judge L. D. Bailey, of the supreme court, was chairman of this board. Hon. I. T. Goodnow, State Su perintendent of public instruction, at this time favored the students with an address. Tho anniversary oration was pronounced by his honor Judge Brewer, of Leavenworth. The attendance of the educational men of the state was large, and the harvest of good words not small. The summer a vacation was spent in planning the next year's work. A more extended circular was issued, and quite generally distributed. Notices of the school appeared in mo6t of the state pa pers. Prof. H. B. Norton, graduate of the Illinois Normal University, accept ed the position of Associate Principal. The State Teachers' Association, under the presidency of U. D. McCarty, of Leavenworth, granted to the Normal School a kindly recognition, by a reso lution expressing their sense of its im portance, and recommending it to the confidence of friends of education throughont the state. The first term's work was regarded but as a trial of the machinery. Mr. Goodnow, the state superintendent, re ported to the -legislature concerning it : "The school opened as an experiment, And is demonstrated a success." The second term began about the middle of September, 18G5. The same students were present as during the first term, with an addition to their number, mak ing in all, sixty. Nothing occurred during the year to interrupt the har mony of the school, or prevent the suc cessful working of all connected with it. The number of students for the year was eighty-five. There were three terms, the last closing in June. The an niversary oration at this term was giv en by Mr. Norton, Mr. Goodnow again addressed the students. The closing exercises were reported in all the prin cipal state papers. By reason of the increasing number of students, making the apartments then in use entirely inadequate to the wants of the school, it was decided to ask the state for an appriation to con struct a building, which, answering the purposes of a school for a few yearst might then be set apart for the use of the Model School department, without loss to the state. - This was in the win ter of 18C5-6. The legislature, through the influence of Hon. C V. EsEridge, slate senator, and Hon. Jacob Stotler member of the House, very willinglv acceded to the request, and authorized the board of directors to construct a suitable edifice at the state's expense. This was done. The building; was ar ranged with special reference to the wants of a teachers' school, and has proved well adapted to the purpose for which it was designed. Utility and economy of construction were before the minds of the board of directors, rather than beauty and architectural fin ish ; still the latter were not ignored. The architect's plan and specifications, were made out by T. II. Lescher, Esq., of Lawrence ; Mr. John Hammond, of Emporia, was the builder. From the Principal's report for 1866, is taken the following passage, as a brief exposition of the essential eharacteris tics of the school : "In the Normal School the same means are employ ea in tne education or its students, as in other Institutions of learning. The same kinds of text-books are used, classes are formed in the same way, and recitations conducted as is usual. There is this important difference, however : in other schools the end to be attained in each recitation is a knowledge, on the part of the student, of the principles under consideration. In the Normal School this thorough understanding of the lesson is but the means ; the end is the ability to teach the same principles to others. In the Normal class-room the student is required to analyize each mental process by which ho arrives at conclusions ; and the question is ever before him, how can the demonstration be divided into parts, so that each shall be within reach of the child's mind ; and then what is the logical order of ar rangement by which these may be put together so that the pupil may be able to grasp the whole, and also be able to trace the relations of the parts, each to the others. The art of teaching every branch of study pursued, may therefore, be mentioned as a distinctive feature of the teachers' school." Extracts are also presented from the report of II. I. Fisher, of Lawrence ; Judge Aiken, of Council Grove ; and S. S. Prouty, of the Burlington Patriot, Board of Visitors for 1866, to show the man agement and condition of the school at the time of the official visit, which was in December of that year, during one of the ordinary working days of the term : "One of your committee has visited the school on previous occasions, and can speak from actual observation when asserting that It is in better condi tion now than at any former time. The number of pupils enrolled for the pres ent term is seventy-five. Now, as here tofore, the order and discipline of the school is above all criticism. The ut most quiet and decorum prevailed throughout. Teachers aud pupils ap peared thoroughly in earnest. All things moved with absolute, mechanical pre cieion. There was no trace of the spirit ot mischief, disorder and indolence, which so mars and belittles the great majority of our educational institutions, Regarded merely as a model for other schools of the State, a means for incit ing otner teaciiers to like triumphs in order and educational exelleuce, our Normal School is worth, ten times over, all it has cost us. It is now approach ing the close of its second year. Many pupils have been in attendance during this period. The effect of these years of training is shown in the steady de velopment of the elements of scholarly excellence. There was a greater free dom of speech than formerly ; a keener and subtler appreciation of obscure and difficult topics ; more vigorous and orig iual thoughts ; a better mastery of eye and hand in all the departments of graphical illustration." Another extract from the same report, will show something of the conduct, recitations, and the class drill so charac teristic of Normal Schools, and so nec essary to the teacher. The instructor must learn to talk, and to illustrate. "One of the most immediately notice able points, was tho rigid persistence with which the topical system of recita tion wa enforced. The old stereotyped system of questions and answers was utterly discarded. Topics, a ft en con sisting of a single word, were assigned to pupils ; and each, without the slight est reference to text book or raemor anda, was required to rise, and develop the leading points of it in his own lan guage, and in proper consecutive order, with constant and copious blackboard illustrations. For example, the topic assigned to the pupil might be The Andes.' He was required to sketch upon the board a complete map of that system of mountains, with all their ira portant ramifications, the valleys, plat eaus and lakes they enclose, and rivers flowing from them; to describe the height of all the different chains, and principal peaks, to give the local names, latitude and longitude, altitude, climate and special characteristics of all the dif- ferent points of the map. When all this has been done, the topography of th rpcrinn in nniai!nn i, UraA in hnii and indelible relief unon the mind of the pupil." The dedication of the Normal School building, was on the 2d day of January, 1867, at the opening of the second term 01 mat scnoot year. $id,bou.uu was the entire cost of the building to the State. One paragraph is quoted from the address of President Horner, of Baker University, at the dedication : "in the erection or these massive walls, iu the completion of this fair fab ric, this ornate temple of learning, the intelligence of our people, and the wis dom of our legislators have forged another, and the brightest, link in our educational system. Intimately con nected as it is, with the welfare and success of our common schools, the grand basis upon which rests the superstructure of onr education al system, and the crowning glory of our civilization, it is, and most ever continue to be, the pride and glory of our people. Already it is infusing into our common schools the healthful, invigorating influence of its teaching, It will elevate the teacher's humble call ing to its proper place In the ranks of the learned professions. Its mission is to supply skillful, trained, disciplined, professional teachers for the thousand schools of the State. We only need these to develop in our State a system of education that will reflect immortal honors upon its founders." The Institution was now upon firm footing. From that time is growth has been steady and constant. Step by step, it has kept pace with the advancement of our young State. At the close of the year 1S67 a class of two ladies was graduated. On the opening of the school in September of that year, the increased attendance rendering it neces sary, another teacher was added to the Faculty Sirs. J. H. Gorham, of the Illi nois Normal University. At the same time the organization of the school was completed by the establishing of the Model Department. The nnmber of pupils was limited to thirty, as only that number could be accommodated in the room fitted np for that purpose, in the second story of the Normal bui'd Ing. At tbs eloM of the year, as shown by the Principal's Report, there were in the Normal Department one hundred and twenty-five students, and ia both departments one hundred and fifty-two. A class of four young ladies graduated this year. President Edwards, of the Illinois Normal University, was present at the Commencement Exercises, and gave the Anniversary Address. School closed late in J nne of 1868, to give the teachers from the Agricultural College at Manhattan, the State University at Lawrence, and representatives of other prominent educational institutions throughout the State an opportunity to visit, insnpt-t. and strwlv its wnrlrintrs an opportunity of which they were not I slow to avail themselves. AH express ed their appreciation of the school and its rosults, in the highest terms. In the fall of 1868, it became neces sary to increase the r acuity, and Miss M. J. Watson, a member of the first graduating class, accepted the position. Miss Ellen Plumb, the other member of the same class, now took charge of the Model Department, and the School moved on. At the close of the year, in June. 1SC9. a class of nine was srradua, ted. Hon. T. D. Thacher, delivered the Anniversary Address. I add a full list of the graduates of the institution: class of 1S67.
