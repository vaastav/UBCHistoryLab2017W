EBICA FIRST LCR^ INDUSTRY FINANCE A supreme moment of history has comc. The eyes of the peo pie have been opened and they see. The hand of God Is laid up on the nations. He will show favor, 1 devoutly believe, only If they rise to the clear heights of His own justice and mercy. —Woodrow Wilson. THE CROSS ABOVE THE CRESCENT AT JERUSALEM. The country selected by the Al mighty as the place where the Son of God should accomplish the re demption of mankind is again under Christian rule. This achievement of the allied ar mies calls to mind the history of the Crusades, originated by Peter, the Hermit, during the closing years of the eleventh century. The Crusades for the rescue of the Holy Land from the Turks extended over a period of upwards of 100 years, and were not abandoned by the Christians "until the hones of two mil lions of their sons lay whitening on the plains of Asia." Lon'g may the cross wave over the Holy City. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Wilson's recent message to Congress has been generally com mended by the newspapers of Eng land, France and Italy, and also by the press of South America and Can ada. It has been referred to by many as the greatest address that has been delivered by any statesman since the commencement of the war. The mes sage rises to the clear heights of jus tice and mercy for all humanity, friend and foe alike. The following summary from the New York World outlines the general trend of the message: President Wilson's address to Con gress sounds a clear, ringing note of leadership to all the nations that are battling against Prussian autoc racy. It is both a great war message and a great peace message—a great war '^message in its uncrompromising de termination that the war must be won, and a great peace message in Its enlightened statement of the prin ciples upon which the security of civ ilization must rest. The President's address of yester day is in the spirit of his war ad dress of April 2 and of his reply to the Vatican. Although he sums up the case in somewhat different terms, It is the same case with the same con clusion. There can be peace "when the Ger man people have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those fipokesmon are ready in the name of their people, to accept the common Judgment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the bases of law' and of covenant for the life of the world.". There can be peace "when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and the reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done." Nor does the President hesitate to be specific in de fining some of the conditions of that settlement, and it is sufficiently com prehensive to include a "peace of Justice and generosity" for the Ger man people themselves when they have given the guarantees that are re quired. For weeks the Bolsheviki who seiz ed the government at Petrograd have been demanding through their Len ities and Trotzkys a restatement of the alms and objects of the Allies. Last week the Marquis of Lansdowne Joined in his demand. So far as the United States is concerned the Pres ident has answered, and answered frankly. We may take it for granted that this answer will receive the same measure of approval in Great Britain and France that was accorded to his reply to the Vatican's peace proposals. The matter stands now where it stood then. There has been no change. We are dealing with the same German government, dominated by the same men and actuated by the same motives. "We are seeking per manent, not temporary, foundations for the peace of the world'" and such being the case we must push the war to its righteous conclusion. Delivered to Congress and to the American people, the President's ad dress Is intended for a far wider audi ence. It is spoken directly to the peo ple of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy. It is spoken emphatically to the Russians, for. whom he has a special message. It is spoken as well to the Germans, with whom we are 1 Vat war, to all the allies of Germany ,N and to all the peoples whose future Adepends upon the outcome of this con flict. At all times it is a message of democracy, of justice and of law, which cannot fail to exert ft tremenduous in fluence everywhere. Unquestionably the President has voiced the sentiment of the American people, both in his definition of the kind of peace that can be accepted and in his call for the most vigorous prosecution of the war of which the ___ nation is capable. We believe, as well, that ho has voiced the sentiment of' all tlie great peoples who are spilling their blood and treasure in resisting the domination of the most ruthless military autocracy known to modern history. In him the democracies of the jj= world have found a leader.whose eyes look steadily and unflinchingly to ward the light. 

ITALIANS HAVE GERMAN NECK IN A NOOSE. When the Austro-German armies made their smashing attack upon the Italian front last month, it was quite evident that the? would have to drive the Italian armies through the moun tains and reach the sunny plains of Italy before the arrival of severe win ter weather, or they would he in a trap. For days and weeks the German commander has thrown his army in gre^t masses against the mountain fortresses of Italy, and has failed to break through. He has sacrificed hundreds of thousands of his best men,, and has suffered such stagger ing losses that his army is now oblig ed to discontinue its attacks on ac count of complete exhaustion. It begins to look as though the Austro-German commander had poked his head into a noose. He is now in the mountains of northern Italy with an unyielding foe in front of him. the Alps behind him, and winter up on him. The Italians have already been re inforced by a large French army that has taken over a considerable section of their line. It begins to look as though the Aus tro-Germans were in as dangerous a position as Napoleon was when he reached Moscow in 1812. They can not remain where they are. In their frontal attacks they have been slaugh tered as they were at Verdun. A re treat back through the Alps in the winter is a perilous undertaking.
