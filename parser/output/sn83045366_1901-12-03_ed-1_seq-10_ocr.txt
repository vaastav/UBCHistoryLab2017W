TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 3, 1901. President Roosevelt's First Message to Congress. tions at length and I ask your attention to the report and recommendations. I call special attention to the need of Btrict economy in expenditures. The fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly In providing whatever 1b actual ly necessary to our well-being, should maka ua doubly careful to husband our Amend the Interstate Commerce Law. In 18S7 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate railways, com «nonly known as the interstate commerce act. The cardinal provisions of that act ■were that railway rates should be just and reasonable and that all shippers, locali ties and commodities should be accorded equal treatment. A commission was cre ated and endowed with what were sup posed to be the necessary powers to .exe cute the provisions of this act. That law was largely an experiment. Experience has shown the wisdom of its purposes, but has also shown, possibly, that some of its requirements are wrong, certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its provisions are defec tive. Those who complain of the man agement of the railways allege that estab lished rates are not maintained; that re bates and similar devices are habitually resorted to; that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper; that they drive out of business the small er competitor; that while many rates are too low, many others are excessive, and Work of the Department of Agriculture. The department of agriculture during •the past fifteen years has steadily broad ened its -work on economic lines, and has accomplished results of real value in up building domestic and foreign trade. It ias gone into n»w fields until it is now in touch with all Bections of our country .and with two of the. island groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction, ,whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood. It is searching the world ■for grains, grasses, fruits, and vegetables KMdally fitted if or Introduction into lo Forest Preservation and Irrigation.

The fundamental idea (Of i^restry is the perpetuation of forests iby use. Forest protection is not an end of Itself; it Is a means to increase and isustaln the resources of our country and it he industries which depend upon them. The preservation of our forests is an im perative business necessity. We have fcome to see clearly that whatever de stroys the forest, except to make way for agriculture, threatens our well being. The practical usefulness of the nation al forest reserves to the mining, grazing, irrigation, and other interests of the re gions in which the reserves lie has led .to a "widespread demand by the people of the west for their protection and exten sion. The forest reserves will inevitably ibe of Btill greater use in the future than ,ln the past. [Additions should be made ito them whenever practicable, andi their ■usefulness should be increased by a thor oughly business-like management. Bad Diffmtlon xtl Responsibility. At present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the genral land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber with the United States geological sur vey, and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the bureau of for estry, which is also charged with the gen eral advancement of practical forestry in the United States. These various func tions should be united in the bureau of forestry, to which they properly belong. The prosent diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective co-operation between the government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves, without whica the interests of both must suffer. The scientific bureaus generally should be put under the department of agricul ture. The president should have by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the department of agri culture. He already has such power in the case of lands needed by the departments of war and the navy. Wntor Supply. The wise administration of tne forest reserves will be not less helpful to the Interests which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass. The water supply Itself depends upon the forest. In the arid region It is water, not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would sustain a population grater than that of our whole country to-day if the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for Irrigation. The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital in ternal questions of the United States. Certain of the forest reserves should Elso be made preserves for the wild forest creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected from fires. Many of them need special protection because of the great injury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer, elk, and other animals in the Yellowstone Park shows what may be expected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law and properly guarded. Some of these areas have been so denuded of sur face vegetation by overgrazing that the ground-breeding birds, including grouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have been exterminated or driven away. At the same time the water-stor ing capacity of the surface has been de creased or destroyed.thus promoting floods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams between rains. In cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years, vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and deer are coming back, and hundreds of persons, especially from the immediate neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping. Protection to Fauna, anil Flora. Some at least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection to the native fauna and flora, safo havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping grounds for the ever-increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to find rest, health and recrea tion; In the splendid forests and flower clad m«adows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be set apart for ever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and not sacrificed to the short sighted greed of a few. The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood and re plenishing them in drought they make possible the use of waters otherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from wash ing, and so protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conserva tion is therefore an essential condition of water conservation. The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their con struction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual states acting alone. Far-reaching Interstate problems are in volved; and the resources of single states would often be inadequate. It is properly a national function, at least in some of its features'. It is as right for the national national resources, as each of us bus bonds his private resources, by scrupu lous avoidance of anything like wasteful or reckless expenditure. Only by avoid ance of spending money on what is need less or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to the point required to meet our needs that are genuine. that gross preferences are made, affect ing both localities and commodities. Rates Should Be Just. Upon the other hand, the railways as sert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving carriers of that right of con certed action which they claim Is neces sary to establish and maintain nondis criminating rates. The act should be amended. The rail way is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to it that within its Jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. At the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lif&blood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment and operation of these commercial agencies. The subject is one of great im portance and calls for the earnest atten tion of the congress. callties in the several states and terri tories where they may add materially to our resources. By scientific attention to soil survey and possible new crops, to breeding of new varieties of plants, to experimental ship ments, to animal industry and applied ■chemistry, very practical aid has been given our farming and stockgrowing In terests. The products of the farm have taken an unprecedented! place in our ex port trade during the year that has just closed. government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engin eering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods in reser voirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy of river control, under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams.. The government Bhould construct and maintain these reservoirs as It does other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the came course under the same laws as the natural flow. Reclamation of Arid Lands. The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands present a different problem. Here It is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The object of the gov ernment is to dispose of the land to set tlers who will build homes upon it. To accomplish this object, water must be brought within their reach. The pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along streams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain, however, vast areas of public land which can be made available for homestead settlement, but only by reser voirs and main-line canals, impracticable for private enterprise. These irrigation works should be built by the national government. The lands reclaimed by them should be reserved by the govern ment for actual settlers, and the cost of construction should so far as possible, be repaid by the land reclaimed. The dis trihution of the water, the division of the streams among irrigators, should be left to the settlers themselves in conformity with state laws and without interference with those laws or with vested rights. The policy of the national government should be to aid irrigation in the several states and territories in such manner as will enable the people in the local com munities to help themselves, and as will stimulate needed reforms in the state laws and regulations governing irrigation. Would Enrich the Whole Country. The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic states. The in creased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial production, while wider home markets and the trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of min ing and other Industries, which would otherwise not come into existence at all. Our people as a whole will profit, for suc cessful home-making is but another name for the upbuilding of the nation. The necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration of the poli cy just described. It would be unwise to begin by doing too much, for a great deal 'will doubtless be learned, both as to what can and what cannot be safely attempted, by the early efforts, which must of neces sity be partly experimental in character. At the very beginning the government should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt, its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public Interest. No reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal or local inter ests; but only in accordance with the ad vice of trained experts, after long inves tigation has shown the locality where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the great est usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be no extravagance, and the believers In the need of irriga tion will most benefit their cause by see ing to it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys. Homes on Irrigated Land. Whatever the nation does for the exten sion of irrigation should harmonize with, and tend to improve, the condition of those now living on irrigated land. We are not at the starting poing of this development. Over two hundred millions of private cap ital has already been expended in the con struction of irrigation works, and many millions of arid land reclaimed. A high degree of enterprise and ability has been shown in the work itself; but as much cannot be said in reference to the laws re lating thereto. The security and value of the homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water; but the major ity of these rest on the uncertain founda tion of court decisions rendered in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid states have failed to provide for the certain and just division of streams in times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or neces sities, and many streams have already passed into private ownership, or a control equivalent to ownership. Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders productive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of such ownershio, which has been per mitted to grow up in the arid regions, should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the public water supplies. Laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid regions, where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it, have no proper application in a dry country. Rlßht of Use Only. In the arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rights of others than users, without compensation to the public, la open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the public utilities of cities. A few of the western states have already recognized this, end have incorpo rated In their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual state ownership of water. The benefits which have followed the un aided development of the past Justify the nation's aid and co-operation in the more difficult and Important work yet to be ac complished. Laws so vitally affecting homes as those which control the water supply will only be effective when they have the sanction of the irrigators; re forms can only be final and satisfactory when they come through the enlighten ment of the people moat concerned. The larger development which national aid In sures should, however* awaken in ©very Hawaii, Porto Rico and Relations With Cuba. In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor; we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the island should be shaped with this end in view; the well being of the average home-maker must af ford the true test of the healthy develop ment of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system. It is a pleasure to say that it Is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto Rico than as to any state or territory within our continental limits. The island is thriving as never before, and It is being administered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection of the United States, and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material wel fare must be carefully and Jealously con- Bldered as the welfare of aqy other portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free access tor their products to the markets of the United States. I ask the attention of the congress to the Weighty Problem of the Philippines. In the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropical islands, in habited by many varying tribes, repre senting widely different stages of prog ress toward civilization. Our earnest ef fort is to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our nation by making it of the high est benefit to the Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we intend to do, we point to what we have done. Al ready a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained in the Philippines than ever before in their history. It is no light task for a na tion to aohieve the temperamental qualities without which the insti tutions of free government are but an empty mockery. Our people are now auocessfully governing themselves, because for more than a thousand years they have been slowly fitting themselves, sometimes consciously, sometimes un consciously, toward this end. What has taken us thirty generations to aohieve, we cannot expect to see another race ac complish out of hand, especially when large portions of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the Philippine people we must show both patience and strength, forbearance and steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for the islanders merely what has else where been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what (has never be fore been done for any people of the trop ics—to make them fit for self-govern ment after the fashion of the really free nations. Oar Zeal Disinterested. History may safely bo challenged to show a single Instance In which a master ful race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies of war to take posses sion of an alien land, has behaved to its inhabitants with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in the Philippines. To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous an archy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity. The character of Governor Taft and of his as sociates and subordinates is a proof, if such be needed, if the sincerity of our ef fort to give the islanders a constantly in creasing measure of self-government, ex actly as fast as they show themselves fit to exercise.it. Since the civil govern ment was established not an appointment has been made in the islands with any ref erence to considerations of political in fluence, or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the needs of the service. In our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, it may be that here and there we have gone too rapidly, in giving them local self-government. It is on this side that our error, if any, has been committed. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of finding out the facts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives, can assert that we have not gone far enough. We have gone to the very verge of safety in hastening the process. To have taken a sfngle step farther or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness, and might well have been crime. We are extremely anx ious that the natives shall show the power of governing themselves. We are anxious first for their sakes, and next, because it relieves us of a great burden. There need not be the slightest fear of our not con tinuing to give them all the liberty for which they are fit. The only fear is lest in our overanxlety Necessity of a Pacific Cable. I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to points in Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable. It is de manded not merely for commercial but Foreign Relations and Monroe Doctrine The true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting peace; and this nation moat earnestly desires sin cere and cordial friendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years, wars between the great civilized powers have become less and less frequent. Wars ■with barbarous or semi-barbarous peo ples come in an entirely different cate gory, being merely a most regrettable but necessary international police duty which must be performed for the sake of the welfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep it; but more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly of Tv-ar and are attaining that con dition of Just and Intelligent regard for •the rights of others which will in the end, as we hope and believe, make world-wide peace possible. The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment. This same peace conference acquiesced In our statement of the Monroe doctrine THE 

MINNEAPOLIS JOUBNAL. arid state the determination to make its irrigation system equal In justice and ef fectiveness to that of any country in the civilised world. Nothing could be more unwise than for isolated communities to continue to learn everything experimental ly, instead of profiting by what is already known elsewhere. We are dealing with a new and momentous question, in the preg nant years while Institutions are forming, and what'we do will affect not only the present but future generations. Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and provide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this new industry the best pos sible social and industrial conditions; and this requires that we not only understand the existing situation, but avail ourselves of the beat experience of the time in the solution of its problems. A careful study should be made, both l y the nation and the states, of the irrigation laws and con ditions here and abroad. Ultimately it will probably be necessary for the nation to co-operat* with the several arid states in proportion as these states by their leg islation and administration show them selves fit to receive it. need of legislation concerning the public lands of Porto Rico. Reduction of Duties Recommended. In Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent govern ment of the islands upon a firm footing that before the present session of the congress closes this will be an accom plished fact, Cuba will then start as her own mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds this new page of^Jier destiny, we extend our hearti est greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the question of rec iprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of na tional interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of pro viding for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban Imports into the United States. Ouba ha 9in her constitu tion affirmed what we desire, that she should stand, in International matters, In closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of her material well-being. ,we give them a degree of independence lor which they are unfit, thereby invit ing reaction and disaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that la a given district the people can govern them selves, selfgovernment has been given in that district. There is not a locality fitted for selfgovernment which has not •received it. But it may well be that in pertain cases it will have to he withdrawn /because the inhabitants show themselves .unfit to exercise it; such instances have already occurred. In other words, there is not the slightest chance of our failing to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in the opposite direc tion. There are still 'troubles ahead in the islands. The insurrection has become an affair oX local ibanditti and marauders, ,who deserve no higher regard than the ,brigands of portions of the old world. Encouragement, direct or indirect, to these insurrectos stands on the same footing as encouragement to hostile In dians in the days when we still had In dian wars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remains peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration, hut to .have it understood that we will show no ■weakness if he goes on the warpath, so we must make it evident, unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands of civilization and humanity, ithat while we will do everything in our power for the Filipiuo who is peaceful, iwe will take the sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the path, of the insurrecto and the ladrone. The heartiest praise is due to large numbers oif the natives of the islands for .their steadfast loyalty. The Maca'bebes have been conspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag. I recommend that the secretary of war be empowered to take some systematic action in the way .of aiding those of these men who are crippled in the service and the families of those who are killed. Additional I-e«ii«lntioii. The time has come when there should be additional legislation for the Philip pines. Nothing better can be done for the islands than to introduce industrial enter prises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to indus trial development. The connection be tween idleness and mischief is proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one of the surest preventives of war. Of course no business man will go into the Philippines unless it is to his in terest to do so; and it is immensely to the interest of the islands that he should go In. It Is therefore necessary that the con gress should pass laws by which the re sources of the Islands can be developed; so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doing business in them, and every encourage ment be given to the incoming of busi ness men of every kind. Not to permit this is to do a wrong to the Philippines. The franchises must be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee the Indians against any kind of improper exploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed, and the capital willing to develop it. must be given the opportunity. The field must be thrown open to individual enterprise, which has been the real factor in the de velopment of every region over which our flag has flown. It is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with gen eral transportation, mining, banking, cur rency, homesteads, and the use and own ership of the lands and timber! These laws will give free play to industrial en terprise: and the commercial develop ment which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them. for political and military considerations. Either the congress should immediately provide for the construction of a govern ment cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which like advantages to those accruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a private cable company. as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference. The Monroe doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United States. Just seventy eight years have passed since President Monroe in his annual message annpunced that "the American continents are hence forth not to bo considered as subjects for future colonization by any European power." In other words, the Monroe doc trine is a declaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non- American power at the expense of any American power on American soil. It is in no wise intended as hostile to any na tion in the old world. Still less is it ln 7 tended to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere. During the past century other influences have established the permanence and in dependence of the smaller states of Eu- rope. Through the Monroe doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like inde pendence and secure like permanence for the lesser among the new world nations. This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any American power, Bave that It in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires, mother words, it is really a guaranty of the com mercial independence of the Americans. We do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other American state. We do not guarantee any state against punishment if it misconducts itself, provided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisiton of territory by any non-Ameri can power. Importance of an Isthmian Canal. No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this con tinent is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the isthmus connecting North and South America. Its importance to the na tion is by no means limited merely to Its material effects upon our business pros perity, and yet with view to these effects alone it would be to the last degree im portant for ua immediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be moat marked upon the Pacific coast and the gulf and south Atlantic states, it would also greatly benefit other sec tions. It is emphatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as pos sible; it is one of those great works which only a great nation can undertake with prospects of success, and which when done are not only permanent assets in the nation's material interests, but standing monuments to its constructive ability. I am glad to be able to announce to yon that our negotiations on this subject Upbuilding of the Navy Must Proceed The work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. No one point of our policy, foreign or domestic, is mor& important than this to the honor and ma terial welfare, and a"bove all 'to the peace, of our nation in the tfuture. Whether we desire it or not, we must henceforth rec ognize that we have international dutieß do loss than international rights. Even if our flag were hauled down in the Phil ippines and; Porto Rico, even if we decided not to 'build the Isthmian canal, we should need a thoroughly trained navy of ade quate size, or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce is always to be carried in for eign liottoms, we must have war craft to protect it. Inasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of abandoning the path upon which they have entered, and especially in view of the fact that the building of the isthmian canal is fast be coming one of the matters which the whole people are united in demanding, it is imperative that our navy should be put and kept in the highest state of efficiency, and should foe mad© to answer to our growing needs. So ifar from being in any way a provocation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guar anty against war, the cheapest and most effective peace insurance. The cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which this nation can pos sibly pay. Probably no other great nation in the world is ao anxious for peace as we are. There is not a single civilized power which as anything whatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want is peace; and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for our rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to their rights in return, to insure fair treatment to us commercially, and to guarantee the safety of the American people. No Ignominious Peace. Our people intend to abide by the Mon roe doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the western hemisphere. The navy offers us the only means of making our insist ence upon the Monroe doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever na tion chooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed; not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling. It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships must be built and the men trained long in advance. Some auxiliary vessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of any better for the minor work, and a propor tion of raw men can be mixed with the highly trained, their shortcomings being made good by the skill of their fellows; but the efficient fighting force of the navy when pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively in the warships that have been regularly built and in the officers and men who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been trained to handle their formid able but complex and delicate weapons with the highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships (|hat dealt the decisive blows at Manila an 4 Santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years, and they were able to do as they did be cause the men in the conning towers, the gun turrets, and the engine-rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty. Our present navy was begun In 1882. At that period our navy consisted of a col lection of antiquated wooden ships, al ready almost as out of place against mod ern war vessels as the galleys of Alci biades and Hamilcar —certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at that time did we have men fit to handle a mod ern man-of-war. Under the wise legisla tion of the congress and the successful administration of a succession of patriotic secretaries of the navy, belonging to both political parties, the work of upbuilding the navy went on, and ships equal to any in the world of their kind were continual ly added; and what was even more impor tant, these ships were exercised at sea singly and in squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the best possible service out of them. What the Sitanlgh War Proved. The result was seen in the short war with Spain, which was decided with such rapidity because of the infinitely greater preparedness of our navy than of the Spanish navy. While awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and manned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the Philippines and In Cuba, we must not forget than an equal meed of praise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been struck. The congressmen who voted years in advance the money to lay down the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor plate; the department officials and •the business men and wage workers who furnished what the congress had author ized; the secretaries of the navy who asked for and expended the appropria tions; and finally the officers who, in fair weather and foul, on actual sea service, trained and disciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war in sight— all are entitled to a full share in the glory of Manila and Santiago, and the re spect accorded by every true American to those who wrought such signal tri umph for our country. It was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we fail to show forethought and preparation now, there may come a time when disaster will befall us instead of triumph; and Should this time come, the fault will rest primarily, not upon those whom the ac cident of events puts in supreme com Guard the Efficiency of the Army. It ia not necessary to increase our army beyond its present size at this time. But It Is necessary to keep it at the highest Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guar anty of our own good faith. We have not the slightest desire to secure any terri tory at the expense of any of our neigh bors. We wish to work with them hand In hand, so that all of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of them, we gladly hail their material prosperity and political stability, and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall into industrial and po litical chaos. We do not wish to see any old world military power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become a military power ourselves. The peoples of the Americas can prosper best If left to work out their own salvation in their own way. with Great Britain, conducted on bdth sides in a spirit of friendliness and mu tual good will and respect, have resulted In my being able to lay before -the senate a treaty which if ratilled will enable us to begin preparations for an Isthmian canal at any time, and which guarantees to this nation every right that it has ever asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty, the old Clayton-Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the construction and main tenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is abrogated. It specifically pro vides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without fhe guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the sen ate, and if approved the congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the build ing of the canal. mand at the moment, but upon those who have failed to prepare in advance. There should be no .cessation in the work of completing our navy. So far ingenuity ihas been wholly unable to de vise a substitute for the great war craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas. It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battleships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character I refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy. More Officer* and Men Xeedetl. But there is something we need even more 'JT.n additional ships, and this is additional officers and men. To provide battleships and cruisers and then lay them up, with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual war, would be worse than folly; It would be a crime against the nation. To send any war ship against a com petent enemy unless those aboard it have •been trained by years of actual sea serv ice, including incessant gunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but the bitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and one thousand additional marines should be provided; and an increase in the officers should .be provided by making a large ad dition to the classes at Annapolis. There la one small matter which should be men tioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmeaning title of "na val cadet" should be abolished; the title of "midshipman," full of historic asso ciation, should be restored. Even in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out, for only so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency. The officers and men alike should be kept as much as possible on blue water, for it is there only they can learn their duties as they should be learned. The big ves sels should be manoeuvered in squadrons containing not merely battleships, but the necessary proportion of cruisers and scouts. The torpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers in such manner as will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare. Every detail ashore which can be per formed by a civilian should be so per formed, the officer being kept for his special duty in the sea service. Above all, gunnery practice should be unceasing. It is important to have our navy of ade quate size, but it is even more important that ship for ship it should equal in effi ciency any navy in the world. This is possible only with highly drilled crews and officers, and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and progressive in struction in target ' practice, ship han dling, squadron tactics, and general dis cipline. Our ships must be assembled in squadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never lons at anchor. The resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured; a battlesh.ii> worn out in long training of officers and men is well paid for by the results, while, on the other hand, no matter in how excellent condition, it is useless if the crew be not Trained Crews. We now hay» seventeen battleships ap propriated for, of which nine are com pleted and have been commissioned lor actual service. The remaining eight will be ready in from two to four years, but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are com missioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, and the best weap ons are useless save in the hands of men who know how to fight with, them. The men must be trained and drilled under a thorough and well-planned system of pro gressive instruction, while the recruiting must be carried on with still greater rigor. Every effort must be made to exalt the main function of the officer—the command of men. The leading graduates of the Naval academy should be assigned to the combatant branches, the line and marines. Many of the essentials of success are al ready recognized by the general board, which, as the central offloe of «. growing staff, is moving steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the whole navy, under the secretary. This general board, by fostering the creation of a general staff, is providing for the official and then the general recognition of our altered conditions as a nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet, which meaning is, first, the best men, and sec ond, the best ships. The navel militia forces are state organ izations, and are trained for coast service, and in event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense. They should re ceive hearty encouragement from the gn ral governoment. Nntiouul Naval Reserve. But in addition we should at once provide for a national naval reserve, organised and trained under the direction of the navy department, and subject to the cajl of the chief executive whenever war becomes im minent. It should be a real auxiliary to tfce naval sea-going peace establishment, and offer material to be drawn on at once for manning our ships in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the naval academy, graduates of the naval militia, officers and crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing ves sels and steam yachts, together with, the coast population about such centers as life-saving stations and lighthouses. The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in International af fairs, not merely in political, but 4n com mercial matters. It has "been well said and it would dry up the springs f the that there is no surer way of courting na tional disaster than to be "opulent, ag gressive and unarmed." point of efficiency. The individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this army, are, we have good reason to believe, at least as efficient as those ot any other army In the entire world. It ia our duty to see that their training is of a kind to Insure the highest possible expression of power to these units when acting in combination. The condltldhs of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier demand than ever before upon the individual char acter and capacity of the officer and the enlisted man, tnd to make it far more difficult for men to act together with effect. At present the Sighting must be done in extended order, which means that each man must act for himself and at the same time act in combination with others with,whom he is no longer in the old fashioned elbaw-to-elbow touch. Under such conditions a few men of tho highest excellence are worth more than many men without the special skill which is only found as the result of speoial train ing applied to men of exceptional physique and morale. But nowadays the most valu able fighting man and the most difficult to perfect is the rifleman who la also a skill ful and daring rider. The proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been Increased. The American, cavalrymen, trained to maneuver and fight with equal facility on foot and on horseback, is the best type of soldier for general purposes now to be found in the world. The ideal cavalrymen of the pres ent day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the best infantryman, and who is In addition unsurpassed in the care and management of his horse and la his ability to fight on horsehackk General Staff. A general staff should foe created. As for the present staff and supply" depart ments, they should be filled by details from the line, the men so detailed return ing after a -while to their line duties. It is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the army composed of men who have come to fill the poaitlons by the mere fact of seniority. A system should he adopted by which there shall be an elimi nation, grade by grade, of those who seem unfit to reader the best service in the next grade. Justice to the veterans of the civil war who are still In the army would seem to require that in the matter of re tirement they be given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in tihe navy. The process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a manner that would render It practically impossible to apply political or social pressure on be half of any candidate, no that each man may be judged purely on his own merits. Pressure for the promotion of civil offi cials for political reasons is bad enough, but It is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the army or navy.. Every promotion and every detail tinder the war department must be made solely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of the man himself No pressure, political, social, or personal, of any kind, will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any ques tion of promotion or detail; and if there is reason to believe that such pressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned, it will be held to militate against him. In our army we cannot af ford to have rewards or duties distrib uted save on the simple ground that those who by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them, and that those who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them. Every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly increasing state of efficiency. When on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such service should be required. The paper work in the army, as in the navy, should be greatly reduced. What is needed i 3 proved power of command and capaoity to work well in the field. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commissary depart ments. Field BxereUe* Yearly. Our army is so small and so much scat tered that it is very difficult to give the higher officers (as well as the lower offl oers and the enlisted men) a chance to practice maneuvers in mass and on a com paratively large scale. In time of need no amount of Individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as a coherent whole, under skillful and daring leader ship. The congress should provide means whereby it will be possible to hare field exercises by at least a division of regu lars, and if possible also a division of national guardsmen, once a year. These exercises might take the form of field maneuvers; or, If on the gulf coast or the Pacific or Atlantic seaboard, or In the region of the great lakes, the army corps when assembled could be marched from some Inland point to some point on the water, there embarked, disembarked after a couple of days' journey at some other point, and again inarched inland. Only by actual handling and providing for men in masses while they are marching, camp ing, embarking and disembarking will It be possible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and smoothly. A great debt Is owing from the publics to the men of the army and navy. They should "be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency, so that they may be able to respond In stantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of the nation and the honor of the flag. The Individual Ameri can enlisted man Is probably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other army. Every con sideration should be shown him, and in return the highest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him. It Is well worth while for the congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be Increased to correspond with the increased value of the veteran soldiw. Army Reorganisation. Much good has already come from the act reorganising the army, passed early in the presett year. The three prime re forms, all of them of literally Inestimable value, are, first, the substitution of four year details from the line for permanent appointments In the so-oalled staff divi sions; second, the establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head; third, the establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the army. It would be difficult to overestimate the hn- provement in the efficiency of our army which these three reforms are making, and have in part already effected* The reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially accomplished. The improved conditions In the Philip pines have enabled the war department materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the num ber of soldiers so as to bring: this num ber much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law. There Is, however, need of supplementary legislation. Thorough military educa tion must be provided, end In addition to the regulars, the advantages of this education should be given to the officer* of the national guard and others In -civil life who desire Intelligently to fit them selves for possible military doty. The officers should be given the chance to pjr fect themselves by study In the hlgner branches of this art. At West Point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out men who are good In actual field service; too much stress should not be laid on mathematics, nor should pro ficiency therein be held to establish the right of entry to a corps d'ellte. The typ ical American officer of the best kind need not be a good mathematician I but he must be able to master ■ himself, .to control others and to show, boldness and fertility of resource in every emergency. , Militia. Law Worthless. Action should be taken In reference to the militia and to the raising of volunteer forces. Our militia law. is obsolete and ■worthless. The organisation and arma ment of the national guard of the several states, which are ! treated, as militia in tho appropriations toy the congress, should .be made identical with those provided t or 9
