FHE WEEKLY ALERT Entered In Jamestown Postofflce as Second Class Matter W. EL KBLLOOfl Telephone 72 TEHMS The Dally Alert la delivered In the «Jity by Carriers at 50 cents a month. Dally, one year $6.00 In advance $5.00 Weekly, one year 9150 MR. TAFT'S FIRST MESSAGE President Taft's message was the first of a series of messages which he will deliver to congress from time to time in the next few weeks. The country has grown so large and its business interests are so complicat ed that it is now impossible for any president to say in one message what he desires for congressmen to con eider. Mr. Taft has therefore an nounced that the information he has gathered from the various depart ments and his views on important public matters, will be made known to congress in some eight special mes sages. The first of these messages has lieen delivered and relates al jnost entirely to amendments to the Sherman anti-trust law. It discussed the supreme court decisions by which the Standard Oil and the American Tobacco monopolies are being dis solved. This is one of President Taft's greatest achievements and the country generally, will sooner or lat er, give him credit for it. The president defends the Sher man anti-trust law but suggests that it be strengthened by additional leg islation and not repealed or amended. He believes the remedy for the crim inal trusts is legal disolutio:i under federal direction. The anti-trust law is the creature of the republican pai ty and it has taken 21 years to make the statute useful and effective, aft er the most bitter fight and the president asks why should it now be abandoned, just when it has become useful? "The anti-trust act," says the president, "is the expression of a freedom living people to preserve equality of opportunities." The Sherman law has already resulted in a voluntary reorganization of cer tain injurious trusts, and President Taft's strong endorsement of that law is gradually being understood as the effort of a sincere and able man to do something worth while for the people of this country who bear the burden and heat of the day. Among other propositions which ithe president will urge congress to take action upon is federal rfegula tion of stock and bond issues of transportation companies. A com mission appointed by the pesident, has made a report finding that the public has been called upon to pay dividends upon vast amounts of wat ered stock and that a physical valua tion of railroads is necessary in or der to determine 'how much money the government should permit them .to make. The sheep raisers of the west will 8»old a national convention in Oma ha, December 14 th to 16th. The president of the association, who ought to know something about it, and reflect the views of the members, says that the industry has not been prosperous in ithe last eighteen months owing to the agitation over the wool tariff, which has caused a decline in the prices of wool and al so corresponding falling off in the prices of sheep, which means an an nual loss estimated at $50,000,000 to the wool growers of the country. A protective tariff on that industry is demanded by the wool growers, who in this respect can join hands with the farmers and producers of other products emanating from the soil. The North Dakota School of For estry has prepared a special bulletin on methods of tree culture. Any farmer of the state who Is desirous of special information regarding the kind of trees to plant in this region and planting methods with various other facts and directions in success ful use in the state School of Fores try should have one of these bulle tins. It is Bulletin No. 2 and in cludes directions for tree selection, soil preparation, nursery practice and 'plantation methods. The bulletin is (prepared by Director W. N. Mills, -formerly U. S. Advisor in forestry. 'Everything essential for the success ful growth of trees in North Dakota lis described and referred to In the bulletin. 

MORE MALES THAN FEMALES According to figures reported to .the census bureau there are more males in the population of the United States than females, or a proportion of 106 males for every 100 females. It is generally believed that the num bers of the two sexes are equal, but there is always a slight difference between them and in Northern Eu rope the females exceed the males in population. It is well known in the United States that more male children are born to families of Im migrants Hhan females, why is not stated. Among the negroes the pro portion of the two sexes is more near ly equal. While the number of male children at birth exceeds the females mortality with the former is greater than the later, and through the ex cess of deaths the number of fe males gradually approaches nearer the number of males in the latter years of life exceeds It. There are six states, Including the District of Columbia, In which the number of males is less than the females as follows: State Males Females Massachusetts. .1,655,226 1,711,190 Rhode Island.. 270,359 272,251 Maryland 644,255 651,121 Dist. of Columbia 158,050 173,019 North Carolina 1,098,471 1,107,816 South Carolina 751,842 763,558 While in the above states there is only a net excess of 100,782 females in the country at large, there is a net excess of 2,691,978 males. A writer from the Minnesota uni versity declares that weeds which render worthless many crops after much labor on the part of the farm er have been as a whole, of more value to the race than if the tribe of weeds hai iu existed. Weed seed scattered by various agencies over barren tracts of country, in times gone by, have been the means of forming a soil covering bare rocks and preparing the land .for human habitation. Many of our best plants have come from weeds. The field, orchard and garden products are mostly "improved" weeds. Wheat and oats are developed from two wild grasses and "apples and pears 3 'c 'he children of the will rose, our melons, tomatoes, beets and caul iflower have come to us through ages of evolution from insignificant weeds". Many useful chemicals, medicines and dye stuffs made not only in this country but in other lands, originated in weeds. Yet not withstanding this humble but useful ancestry, farmers of North Dakota are now engaged in a battle with weeds and wild grasses on the re sult of which will rest the future welfare of many a hardworking own er or renter of land. The crusade for better farming in North Dakota is to a large extent a fight against weeds, and the loss of soil fertility absorbed by the intruder, weeds. The defeat of the socialist candi date for mayor in Los Angeles is said to be largely due to the votes of women. The candidate for the good government forces was re-elect ed by a majority of over 40,000 and it is said that 95 per cent of the women who were registered voters, voted at the election and of these 75 per cent voted for Alexander, the successful candidate.

PEOPLE OF JAMESTOWN AND VICINITY Agreeable to a custom that has been previously followed, I take this opportunity to inform the public that in the State Hospital there are many unfortunates who have neither friends or relatives and unless thru the generousity of the people who might be interested in spreading Xmas cheer by donations, however small, these inmates will not be re membered other than in the usual way that the state provides for. These people are like children In-* their likes and behavior and a very small expenditure for each, will en able us to give something that they would greatly appreciate. A small donation in the shape of money, fruit, candy, neckties or handkerchiefs, would be very acceptable and to those who make the donations, would re quest that they be sent to the insti tution in my care before the 2Dth of December. Acknowledgment will be made and all donations or gifts will be greatly appreciated. W. M. Hotchkiss, M. D., Superintendent. SHAKING HANDS WITH CO. H. BOYS F. D.
