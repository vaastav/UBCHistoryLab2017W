PRUSSIA. PENNSYLVANIA. Strike of I lie fonl Mlnfri-An At tempt by the Manager* !? Ball Ike CokI Market ? TUonMnd of Mea rat of Employment?1 Trouble Appre hended. Scran ton, Pa., Decetpber 6.? The miners do not hesitate to say that the strike lias been originated and brought about by the managers for the purpose of bulling coal. At this moment be tween 3*l,00t) and 40,000 miners are out of employment in this country, and as fast as the news flashed over the wires the members of the Miners' and La borers' Benevolent Union, commenced enrolling in the grand army of strikers. Thi# Society is composed of Welsh, Irish, English, Americans and Germans, and has over 40,000 members,all bound by the result of the meeting of the Grand Council, which refuses all compromise with the managers. The Chief Clerk of the coal depart-, ment of the Delaware, Lackawana and Western Kailroad, says that the com pany has 150,000 tons of coal on hand, which is distributed in the yards at Scranton, Port Washington, Hoboken, Elizabeth, Syracuse, Buffalo and Ithica, and in transit at Great Bend and N?w Hampton Junction. The three great companies which control the anthracite region are the Delaware, Laokawaoa A Western, Pennsylvania, and Delaware & Hudson Canal Coal Company. They employ nearly 40,000 men, including the brakemen and laborers employed on the several roads which transport coal. All of the latter sympathise with the stokers, and are necessarily out of em ployment when the miners arc not at work. Much excitement exists and the citi zens are ereatly alarmed. Liquor is freely used and trouble is apprehended. The Union has a fund of $200,000, all of which the strikers will expend rather than submit to the injustice sought to be done them and which they say is only a scheme to raise the price of coal, after which the companies will acceed to their demands.
