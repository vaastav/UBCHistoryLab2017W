' Henry Ward Beech er, in a late speech at tbe Academy of Music, New York, said of the object of the war: "It was also constantly alleged that the North did out go to war for Emancipation, but simply for Union. ' To that I responded, Brae, true. Tbe peculiar construction of our aattoa forbids one Slate to meddle, and the National Government to meddle with the tricily internal municipal affairs of any oth er State. And I, who. have beearankel, if not among abolitionists, yet saong anti- slavery men, ail my lile, lieu myseit to be competent witness to those me a who have fought the anti slavery battle for twenty-five years; and I bore witness that it never was oar intention to interfere by violence in the internal aflairs of Slave States. Oar hope of Emancipation was based upon tbe per petual use of moral influences, the actios of preat commercial laws, the nature of polit ical economy, and above all, the noo-exten-ion of slavery. We held that if tho Slave State might cease to be made, if they that were already created were compelled to stand and bear tbe evil as well as the good of their own system, it would be a question only ol time when they would emancipate, but we never proposed to pat tbe hand of government into those States and violate those institutions, and we did not when the war broke out; and therefore, when it was alleged, that we did not go to war for the purpose of emancipation, I snid amen; we did not. We went to war for the maintain ance of nationality. (Applause.) But then it. was a nationality which had been re generated and brought back to its original nt lihorl. It wm a.

(Loud and enthusiastic applause.) He then spoke of his efforts to develop j American ideas ia England, and to eorreet fake impressions. Weq note a few passages from this part of his speech: THI VTOLIMT VATCBB OF 8LATXRT. MI found a very general impressi n in England, assiduously cultivated on the part of some, and ignorantly received by others, that this was a nation peculiarly, from the vary nature of its institutions and the char acter of its people, to mobs. We are sup posed to be vain, boast'ul, lawless, arrogant, mascrupnlous; and one reason has been that the band of this nation has been southern for the last fifty years. (Applause.) 1 was obliged to say that it was not the North that wanted Cuba; it was not tho North that organized fiilHbustering expeditions to Cen tral America; it was not the North that quarrelled with Mexico; it was not the North that has lei any of the conquers for the last nfty years; tor tbe Aorta is esen tially peaceful, able to make war, but loving peace; and it is the nature of slavery to maintain violence, because it is sallied on bru'.e violence, and rejects moral principle to start with, ana is obhirea in ail the moods and tenses to rely noon physical force for the maintenance ol that unjust and unebns tian sys'en. : Thus the aspect of America has been un favorable in Europe, has arisen not from the characteristic ideas of free society bat from the characteristic mtnners of society.

First, they prevent riot, f t they take away all motive for them; for why should the men that have thr making of the laws ri up agtiosl the laws ot tV.e r own creation? When t e citizen have tho ab solute power to send a man up, or take him down, to enact or to annul, t lay fo nidations or to subvert foundations, why should they go riotiug? What motive is there? .No people in the w.jrld are more conservative than a people who are made universally stockholders in the government. In Amer ica there are two things. First, to a greater extent than in any other country on the globe, every man, clear down to the bottom of society, is a house bolder or a landholder. . and almost without exception, men are en dowed with the elective franchise. They have made the citizen a voter and a proper ty owoer, and thus they have made it almost impossible but that he should be a good cit izen. He has an interest in supporting the laws. He has an interest in the community. His own bouse and family, his wife and children, are so many pledges for his good conduct. And we have no popular riots, and, except in extreme cases, such as cases of infection or mania, they are almost im possible. And when they take place they are more easily repressed, and society is less strained here in the joints, than in any other oountry in the world. And when tbey exUt among us, and I told them so, they are for the most part foreign." (Ap plause.) TUB RIOTS IN NBW YORK.

Aside from these two things, an ig norant foreign population and the fomenting of ideas are derived from slavery, wo might go on for fifty or a hundred yesrs and not a bubble come to the surface in the shape ot a riot. They are not the fruit of American institutions. They are rather in spite of them. They are the disease that is injected upon the healthy system of self govern ment, so far as they exist at all.

" Much was said in England about the inhumanity of war against our brethren. As to that, war is inhuman against any Dooy, and is no more inhuman for ns to bombard Charleston and rebelliou than for Great Britain to barn down a city of 180,000 in habitants iu Japan. War is nothing but police. Is it wrong for a policeman to col lar a burglar or a thief and subdue him Wax is nothing more. And if it be exer cised according to the rules of war, it still ia violence, and so far it is inhuman, because crimes against the public peace require a coercion aad a degree of cruelty which justice must needs carry with it ; but they that exercise justice are not responsible for tbe cruelty, but they that bring it don up on themselves.

O. P. Morto. Governor of Indiana. I Froa th Cisainaati Quell t. KEUOXSTIiUCTIO.ir THE PI Til OF TUB fKEtlDEKT'S VIEW. There hts been ten times more talk about the theory of reconstruction than there is any need of. The real difficulty has been ia carrying any tiie ry into practice- First, : we have to destroy the rebel armies, so that any loyal government can exitt in the rebel S'.ates.- 'Next, we mut confine .the exer cise of the powers of tbe State Government strictly to the honestly loyal people. Who are they? Herein is lha pi'h of the mat ter, aod in the answer to that question i tbe pith of the President's Message. But, before we refer to that, let as examine the premises in which the President's conclu sions are founded. The Constitution of the United States, as we hive often said. acts on individuals only, Its strength lies in the fact, that when any man. or numbtt cept jjjg 0ff.r? What interest do you snp of men, resist the authority of the National : ay wno is not an owner of slaves. Government, that authority etrike down hM la rejectiog it ? Let us look for a mo ion the rebel in spite of any State laws. ment at tjie DUmber of these people. Mr. Lunatic as the States Rights party of the j rjeBow.one of the most bitter rebels, h ti e outh has been, it is not able to deny that, except by claiming that Secession is consti- tutional. Hence it is that, ia the rebellion, according to the whole practical theory of the Constitution, it was individual rebel led. If the States could not secede, much 'ess could its loyal inhabitants be in rebel lion, because its rebel inhabitants noted un der Stale laws. Hence, the sin of the State being done by individuals, it salvation come in tbe same way. The idea that the rebel States are foreign States is nonsense. The idea that a hundred thousand loyal peo ple in Tennessee havo no right to resusci tate their State Government, b .'cause the majority have gone into rebellion, is an idea of gross injustice. We are not at war with foreign States. If we were, we ought to make peace immediately, for we have no wish to make foreign conquests. It is pre cisely because they are not foreign States, that we are fighting them. We are fighting to conquer rebels iu arms against their le gitimate Government. This is just, and so recognized by intelligent men in all ages of the world Iu the only cases where legiti mate Government is overthrown successful ly, it is historically and rightly attributed to force alone. The only olaim of the P oles to the sympathies of mankind is that their own Government was overthrown by force. The rebels in their associations to effect tbe J the principle that one class of men can make overthrow of oar National Gjvemmwnt ar Uf of an Hbor, will always bo governed rebels only.

Dr. Breckenridge said, in his upon who are construe 1 to be loyal people! thanksgiving sermon, whtt ouht to live in Two different constructions may be put up- the heart of every man who loves freedom, on that question.

It Congress. hat will be the practical ef-: fectl Why, she will remain in tbe Union with all her slaves, defy Mr. Lincoln's proc lamation, be restored to her forts, hold her Secession Legislature, and proclaim State Hights as furloosly as ever. The demon of Slavery and rebellion will be there as much as ever. This is what is meant by the "Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is." It is a Union with the bloodhounds who have sprung at your throat and lapped your blood till they ceased only for want of strength. This is a construction of " loyal people' which may suit Mr. Montgomery Blair or Mr. Davis pf Ey, or Mr. James Brooks of Now York, or Mr. Fernando Wood; bat it does not sail the loyal people of the West and North, who have shed their blood, and pat forth their strength, and of fer their wealth to destroy the dogs of reb ellion. They want the destruction so com-, plete that the work is never to be done again. Who, then are the loyal people This is! the precise thing Mr. Lincoln has undertak en to define. And here we may ask, how came Mr. Lincoln to offer his definition in a new proclamation? Why, Mr. Fernando j Wood, Mr. Vallandighhm, Mr. Voorhees,; and all that ilk, are under great concern ot mind that the President has never offered the rebels aoy terms ol amnestytold them anything by wbieh tbey choee, they might retain to their beloved Union whom thev have so long kicked and cuffed with all their might. Tbe rebels were equally concerned. They said: "You are 'be stronger; it is your business to propose something " Mr. Lin coln is an amiable man. aod a just man ; so he saye; "Your loyal people may reconstruct your lawa aad State Governments; and a loyal man is first, ooe who cbeys my pro elamatioo, which sets fret all tk M0NB South Carolina, und nearly all anyvhert; ttcon.il y, who never took any part, as an official or responmhU person, in setting the rebellion goinjp aad, thirdly, who commtn Js neither regimeut, brigade, division, corps or army in the rebel service. That is all. You who are willing to renew yonr allegiance to the laws and Government of the United getting up this Rebellion, mast take their chance to be tried as traitors." Now, what objection is there to that mode of reconstruction? It offers an amnesty and re union to all who tefd obey the law and Constitution a they now are, , except lonae-ine only the leaders. Uoea any one imagine that there are no people in the South to ao ) Compendium of the United States Census for 1850 hiu kindly furnished us with the materials for a iudirement on this subject. We will take throe States, whose population has moved but little siaca ISiO, and show the number of slaveholders and of non slaveholders: Slave- White Males holders. over 21. Sonth Carolina .... 25,596 70.000 North Carolina.... 28.303 UOflOO Tennessee........ 33.SC4 151,000 We have in these States, then, only 87, 763 slaveholders, including men. women, and children, executors and administrators and if we deduct the whole of them from the able-bodied white mails we have 278, 237 noQ-sIavohoIding voters of those three States. In other words, the able bo lie J non slaveholder of those States are three times in number the slaveholders. Nor is that all. Of these 87,000 slaveholders, near ly 40,000 do not own over five slaves, and 13,000 of them only own one slave! Suoh is the atrocious system of moral and politi cal villainy which has involved thirty rail lions of people in blood, disaster aod suf fering. A poor wounded soldier of Arkan sas said: We tout, and foul, and fout, and what was K for 7 AU for our oig men. That is it exactly. A society founded on would not have been the case had the con- spirators at Richmond accepted what was really the amnesty offered in the proclama tion of the President. We should have had therebel States returned with Slavery. As it is, we are willing to leave the question to the real Union men of the South. Is there any probability that they will ever call the serpent back? We think not. Such a bap tism of blood aod saffiriog as they have bad never ends without revolution. E. D. Morrow.
