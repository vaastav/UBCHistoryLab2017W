SKETCH OF HIS MESSAGE. Resumption of Specie Payments at a Fixed Date. THE STATE TROUBLES Inflationists Preparing for the Battle of the Morrow. STARTLING ISSUES OP THE SESSI02T Washington, Dec. 8, UTi. Synopsis or th? President's Message? foreign Relations?Specie Resump tion, Free Banking and an Ample Revenue Recommended?The Internal State Troubles. The President's Message is not yet quite com pieted, owing to a delay in receiving the report or tbe District 01 Colombia Commissioners, a refer ence to which will be added to the Message to. morrow morning. Copies o( the Message are being made to-day for Congress and the pre**. Although (he President has shown the Message to no person other than the members ol the Cabinet and the copyists, there is the best reason lor believing it will contain substantially the following punts lounded on expressions of the President to in timate friends since the Message was submitted to, and cordially indorsed by, the Cabinet on Fri day last:? The President says that although he did not com mence the preparation 01 nis Message until a week ago yesterday some of the newspapers previously prognosticated its contents, ?ltbough he had con sulted nobody as to what It should contain. There is no doubt the Message will state that our rela tions with ail foreign Powers are friendly and without disturbance, though there is an unsettled question with Venezuela wnich has not yet paid the awards of the Joint Commission under the Convention of 1886. Congress, it will be recol lected, strongly expressed its sense on tots subject in February, 1873. The President, In his Message of last December, said there was reason to believe the hesitancy of that Republic in recognizing the claims sprung In part at least irom real dimculty in discharging mem tn conneo tion with Its obUgat.ons to other lovernments, and there lore the expediency of lurther lorbearance on the part of our government was believed to be worthy ol the consideration of Congress. OPB 

SPANISH RELATIONS. In addition to Venezuela we have unsettled questions with Spain growing out of the amur of the Virginlus and other grievous transactiona on the part of the Spanish authorities in con nection with events tn Cuba. The magnitude of the offences has not been reduced since the President's previous Message a year ago. as this unsettled condition of affairs In Cuba cannot long continue it may be come necessary for other nations, with our own to interfere to terminate the insurrection which has so long prevailed, the Spanish government hav ing unsuccessfully attempted to suppress lr. Mean time the commerce of all countries and especially that of the United States suffers, the flags 01 the United States and England having been insulted. The President in conversation, although he does not state the lact in nis Message, says the United States purchase about elgh'y per cent of Cuban exports, and therefore the duties paid by American citizens contribute to this extent in helping Spain to continue the war against the Insurgents. The President had hoped that by the meeting of Congress to-morrow the present negotiations with Spain would nave been ended; but in this he has been disappointed. He thereiore says in his Message Mttle or nothing about Indemnity pending the ne gotiations, but at a future time will present the subject to the special consideration of Congress. THI 

FINANCES. The position of the President on the financial question is positive, as follows :-Notwithstanding the former speculations of those who spoke with out authority, he desires and will recommend the resumption of specie payments at the earliest practicable day; but be does not believe this can be reached as soon as the 1st 01 January, 1878. He does not name any day, leaving Congress to de vise tbe means to secure this desired end, It being the duty or Congress to do so. Tne legal tender clause of tbe Currency act shoila be repealed, to take effect as to contracts made after tbe day to be fixed by law for its re peal. l'ower should be given to the Secretary or the Treasury to obtain go.d ironf and after the date fixed lor the resumption 01 specie payments by the issuance or bonds, in addition to this the revenues or the government should be in excess or the expenditures. To support resumption greater economy should be practised in all depart ments of the government and, if neces ary, the customs and Internal Revenue laws changed, in order to secure a larger amount of revenue. With the return of specie payments 

BANKING SHOt'LD bk FRMK. The blilholdera should continue to be protected as at present under the Banking law. Tnere should be uo limitation to the volume or currency, &s the community itself should determine what amount is required lor business transactions, instead or leaving tne Executive, Secretary 01 the Treasury and Congress to fix the limit, it would be the duty of Congress, however, to make regulations regarding free banks of issue and to state the con ditions on which they can be organized and transact business, the legislation to be in accordance wlih the new order or things, or, in other words, the resumption or specie payments. There should be no monopoly by fixing the amount of issue. The President will recommend that Congresa do not: interfere with the present Currency act passed during last session, unless to amend it so as to conform with apian ror toe resumption of sp&cie payments. The President will make no recommendation on tbe subject of internal improvements by the general government, but will merely refer to tbe ract that Congress &as already appointed a committee on transportation routes to the sea board, which has already made tta report and will give rurther information from more recent investi gation. THE 

STATE TROUBLES. The President devotes much space to affairs In Arkansas, giving reasons why he declined to interfere in the recent difficulties In that state and he adverts to the racts narrated in his special Message to Congress In February, 1873, relative to Louisiana, in which he said he had no specific recommendation to make on tbe subject. But if there were any practical way of removing these difficulties by legislation then be earnestly re quested that the question might be taken op at that session of Congress. He was extremely anxious to avoid any pretence of undue interference in State affairs, and, if Congress differed with him as to what ought to be done, he requested its im mediate decision to that effect, otherwise be should feel obliged, as far as he could by the exercise of legitimate authority, to put an end to tbe unhappy controversy which disturbed tbe peace and pros, trated the business of Louisiana by the recogni tion and support of that government which was recognized and upheld by the conrts of the state. It seemed advisable he should state which eourse he should reel bound to pursue in reference to the matter. In toe event ol no action being taken by Congress at that time, but subjeot to any satis, factory arrangements that might be made by the parties to the controversy, and which, of all things, was the most desirable, it would be his duty, so far as it might be necessary for htm to act, to adhere to ' tbe government heretofore recognized by bim. The President again submits this question to Con- I arras, and will continue to act as he has hereto lore act^d relative to the affairs or Louisiana, unless otherwise controlled by Congress. Tbe President reiterates his confidence in the Indian peace policy, ir adhered to, ne says it will produce Additional beneficial results, and ulti mately iree the frontier of Indian depredations. He alludes to the civil service reform, saying It baa been as closely adhered to as tbe opposi ion manl ested against It permitted. Us results have been beneflclsl, having elevated the capacity and tone of appointments In the several departments of tbe government; but It would be impossible to continue the reform without the di rect support of Congress, sanctioned by tbe people. The President alludes to the reportaof tie hea4a ot tbe several departments, which accompany the Message, and calls attention to their respective recommendations. He again recommends the passage of a law, establishing a court for tbe adjudication of claims or aliens against the government, a bill lor this purpose having been introduced by Judge Law rence at the previous session or Congress. Ti e President does not allude to Utah attain, tbe subject baing lert open tor lu'ure conelieraaon. 1 He cans attention to tbe fact that Chinese immi grants continue to be brought to this country, under tbe condition or slaves according to con tract, and also women, whose character Is snch as to demoralize the communities In which they are located. He invites legislation on this subject, saying It will be bis pleasure as well as duty to eaiorce any law on tne subject FUTtTRK 

APPOINTMENTS. The President, in lurtber conversation, said he had tnree vacant District Judgeships to All, namely ?In Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana, it was probable he might be successful in selecting a suitable appointee for Alabama from tbatState.bnt as to the other States there wai more difficulty and he might therefore be rorced to appoint per sons not now resident In them. As to Arkansas, those best fitted lor the place were ettner In lavor of tho Garland government or desire us total overthrow. Tbe Legal Tender Act? Its Proposed Re peal?Western Inflationists Aroused? Mr. Kelley on Ills Financial Scheme of Gold Bonds. A report that the President and Secretary Brls tow alter consultation had agreed to insert in the Message and in the Treasury report a strong and positive recommendation for tne repeal or the legal tender clause and the fixing or an early day lor the resumption ot Bpecic payments, has aroused a good deal oi leeling. Many Western members, of both parties, are determined to oppose such measures, and some senators as well as Repre sentatives, In conversation witu Mr. Kelley to-day, declared themselves ready to support the three slxty-flve interconvertible bond project ot Mr. Kelley which was unfavorably reported oy the Com mittee or Ways and Means last session. There is no doubt that, even without undue excitement or a oaltuon of Western men of both parties, this scheme could pass the House in Its present temper. Tne inflationists claim the elec tions as btrongly approving them, and tney return to Washington with decidedly greater aggressive courage than they had last session. They point to the fact that of the members or the Committee on Banking and Currenoy, those who favored In flation, Hunter of Indiana, Huobell of Michigan, Farwell or Illinois and Randall or Pennsylvania, were re-elected, while or those favoring; a reform or the currency, Phelps of Mew Jersey and Merriam or Mew York were beaten. Mitchell of Wisconsin, thev assert, would have been beaten ir he hod run, and Hawley, of Connecticut, and Miles, of Mississippi, where the election occurs In the Bpring, may be beaten. Under these circumstances there Is a disposition to make a vigorous and decided issue with the President if he shall recommend measures look ing to contraction and specie resumption, and to ao this, even to the extent of forming a coalition of inflationists of both parties acting compactly together for this single end. How rar this determination has gone Is shown in the letter of Mr. Kelley, given below. He writes in answer to a le'.ter from T. B. Buchanan, Secretary 01 the National Executive Committee or the Indianapolis inflation party, who wrote to Mr. Kelley:?"Any measure seeking to meet tbe de mands or the people which does not abolish banks oi issue, and which does not provide one currency, and that a mil legal tender with the Interconvert ible feature, will not be satlsiactory." To thia Mr. KeUej replied:? Washington, D C.. Deo. 8,1871 T. B. BvCHiiuv, Esq., Indianapolis, inJIana. Dm a Sib:?Yours ot the flrat Inn., covering the clrcu larot November *8, of the National Lx?cutive Commit tee ot the independent party, came to roe in Philadel- ! pbia when I waa too tnuch involved in prepara ion lor leaving hurae for the winter to ka able to acknowledge 1 it. I thank you very much for the expression of <'onll- 1 dence and consideration contained in your favor. I have throughout my lift followed ray convictions, and never ! been willing to yield them to party ; whea I saw the possibility of enforcing them or modifying proposed measures by the assertion of my views, and 1 am now too old to vk-ld my I sense of the value ot personal independence and seit respect. For the present I owe a duty to the ri publican party and will perform it so far as i can consclentii udy. If, however, the demands ot the purtv shall trench upon the domain of conscience or seli-respect, I shall i.e found, at least in so tar. in opposition to it. A lew davs ' will enlighten me on tbls subject. ll the Message or the , President and the report ol the Serrc ary ot the Jreas- j ury are to contain such propositions as wo are told they will with reference to the speedy resumption ot specie payments and the republican party ! accept litem, I shall in no tar co operate wiih those w ho 1 oppose them, let such opposition lead me into what af filiation It may. I have carefully considered your pro- ' posed basis ot tinl. n, and may say tbac I have long > believed and tor some years enforced the doctrine that j it i* the duty ot the government to issue the money of 1 tiie country and to prohibit the circulation ot the n .tes ot corporations, whether state or nation il, aud that the money so issued should be a legal tender for all debts, puulic and private, Including duties on imports. In these views I agreed with tny late distinguished collca/ue, , Thaddeus Steven*, so ear y as 18(58, but having been in siructed by the results of the issue of assignats based upon property, to whi h the government hau no legal tenure, and ot Continental money, tor tno funding of which no provision was made, I nave neld that cuincl dentally with the issue ot government paoer money means should be provided for it* fun i.igin interest bear ing bunds, so that the government might be able to : borrow from its owu people and distrioute the taxes collected irom thein among them when paying the in terest on its funded debt. Benjamin Krankiln urged the Continental Congress to mane no new emission of Continental notes but to borrow at an adequate rate of interest those that had already been Issueu and were not needed lor the ordinary exchanges ot tbe people. Had his ail* ce been taken Continent il money would not have depreciated and its story would not have be come a delusion and a snare, as it now Is, to many honest and well-meaning people. Two classes of bonds should be issued by tbe govern ment tor the absorption of any excels of paper money that might be iseued?one long bonds, with a fire J rate ot interest, payable, principal and interest. In paper, and therefore not likely to be favored or accepted by foreign Investor*: another, interconvertible at the option of the bolder, which, for the reason that it would be interconvertible, wouid be In tbe nature of a call loan, at a lower rate of interest, say 3-6J per cent. With these two classes of loans open to the people there need be no apprehension as to the emission of an excessive volnme of currency, for any excess that might be emit ted would constantly flow back upon the Treasury in the purchase ot one or the other ot these classes of interest bearing bonds. 'ihis perfect acheme was open to us In 1862. But when the House ol Representatives, yielding to the Imperative! demand of the senate, so amended fhe bill which it had Sassed as to provide that the bonds should bear gold in vest and that the duties collected from customs shou.d be In gold and be specifically pledged to the payment of interest on the bonds, It became in psrt impracticable. I do not believe that we can now, consistently with good faith, accept tho greenbacks In payment ot all import duties, though, perhaps, the amount of duties recovered ia so. far In excem ot the interest due upon bonds that a certain cercentage of the duties might be received In paper. Entertaining these views you will see how Important it must, In my judgment, be to reduce our toreign gold In debtednesa, tor until we have done so we cannot estab lish a perfect and economical system of currency, fhe national banking system costs us Irom $i6,uuiv*00 to taJ.iWU.000 gold annually. My Impression is that the sum is nearer t 

U.UUU.O ti than $lt>.tJUU,nU). 1 therefore agree with your proposition to substitute greenbacks for national tisii* notes, abolishing the office of Comp troller ot iti*- currency, and allowing banking, likeevery otner busings, to be conducted by individuals upon their own responsibility. The government, having is sued the currency, would be responsible for It, and therelore would require no deposit of bonds to secure popular faith In its ultimate redemption - and it I* not tho part of government to so far meddle with the private business of tlte country as to lake security lor moneys voluntarily deposited with banks or bunkers. Kacn individual selects his own depository and should do it upon his own Judgment, and at his own responsibil ity. against the proceeds of the threc-iixty-flve bends. 1 should like the proceeds of all the many temporary loans we made dur.ng the war to be used for the benefit of the people, and this could be done in no better man ner than by redeeming gold bearing bonds with such proceeds; or If bonds were withheld from the market, or run up to speculators' prices, to purchase gold, with which to call such bonds as the Treasury Depart ment Is aow from time to lime doing to the profit ol the syndicate of American and foreign bankers. It any one will study the increase ot deposits in Havings Banks in ?ii) year in which our people have been roily employed he will see how steadily increasing a balance there is in every part of our country which seeks investments, coupled with three conditions:?i. security and saiety. 1 i he light of immediate payment or payment ? fter a specified time from the date of demands. 3- A rate of Interest lower than current rates In the market of the neighborhood, but which, in conjunction with absolute safety and the ability to call (or the muds when needed for nse.

Tbe Secretary gives tbe following account of the great naval drill off the coast ol Florida:? Tbe affair of the Virglnlus having occasioned the coa cemration of a naval force of our armored and un armored ships of war In the waters near the Cuban coast much more considerable than bad been assembled at any time since the civil war, and tho disturbed rela tions that brought these ships together having been happily oomposed, the opportunity was seized to instruct the tieet in those naval manoeuvres so assiduously practised every year by the great naval Powers and so highly valued by all naval men as a preparation for war. The officer In command. Hear Admiral A. L. case, was therefore instructed to take his unartnored ships to sea and toperiorm for a month in the waters of Florida north of the I'ortugas the mauwtuvres of a fleet, follow ing the tactical system of the new signal-book, Just then 1 compiled under the dlrecion of the Hureau of .Naviga tion. In tne whole world there can be lotind no better sea lor such manoeuvres than this Ray of Florida, with Its sheltered waters, lis easy an- j cborage and its mild and agreeable winter * climate. The general Instructions oi tho department I were elaborated and carried out in detail with much skill by Hear Admiral < ase and his officers, and manoeu vres by a large force were executed during a tu I month, day alter dav, with great profit to the whole navy, In structing a very large number of officers aud men in the practice ol duties hitherto known to most ol them only in theory. The tieet returned to Key West early m March, and the monitors were then instructed in the same ma ?muivres ss a separate lorce. Hear Admiral Case and the commanding officers under him then devoted them selves tor several weeks to tne pstent scientific in struction ol the officers and men of the vessels in practical gunnery and In the use of torpedoes, that new and powerful elementot navai war still imper fectly known ana needing much caremi experiment by the ships that are to use them in battle. The instruc tions to Hear Admiral Case also called tor earelul exer cise In landing large bodies of men and guns irom the fleet lobe manoeuvred on shore. These weresklltutiy car ried Into effect. A brigade ol l.gjO men was landed snd manoeuvred at Key West on the .'Win of January, un.ler the command of Commodore t. A. Pnrker. Chief 01 Staff: and on March ? * still larger lorce of if,700 ream* i and marines, with Oatllng an I field guns, was thrown on shore under the command of Captain K. slmpson, ol tbe Franklin, in eighty-four boats?the landing being made under cover ol the guns ol tour of the ships ot the fleet, placed wlthiU ea&V rmigc of the shore.

Report of the Trustee?A Discouraging Outlook?The Assets Unsalable. Philadelphia, Dec. 0, 1874. Mr. Edward M. Lewis, trustee in oauk rup'cy In the ca?e or Jay Cooke A Co., alter many months1 preparation, has at last presented to Mr. Cooke's creditors bis report, lie first proceeds, in ib;s document, to enumerate the railroad stocks, bonds, houses, building lots at d "iauua in general" turned o>er to blm lor the benefit of the creditors. The bouses mentioned in the catalogue are all heavilr mortgaged, and the actual valuations or tbe "lands" here, there and everywhere are so covered with encumbrances that they can be locked upon as almost if not entirely swallowed up. Taking the trustees' report (or all it amounts to all the bouses, estates, lands, Ac., ot the firm seem to have been pledged years ago lor borrowed money, and tne only recourse the creditors have Is to accept tne Northern Pacitic bonus, upon wnich tne man ageis of tne bankrupt esmte have fixed a valua tion wblcu tbey know to be "fancy," and lor which they also know said bonds can never be sold In the market. Mr. Jay Cooke's princely residence In uermantown (Ogantz by nauie), wuicb cost over $1,50U,000 to construct, decorate and adorn, is offered Tor sale at the puce oi $600.u00, but tu the critical condition ot the times nuds no purchaser. ine immense hotel at Put-in Bay has also been precipitated upon tne market; but as only $35,000 has been bid lor lr, its lurmture and surroundings, the offer has been declined. 1 he managers oi the ruined estate can evidently find no purchasers lor anytuing ttiey offer lor sale, aud are competed to state the prospective value only oi every hlng they repre sent. The most astonishing revelation ot the re port is the small capital upon wnioj the firm con ducted business. Tbe protttB derived from otter people's money was divided among tnemselves. and upon the firm's coliapse tne creditors were leu destitute. Jay Cooke, McCullocn a Co., oi London, at first represented claims against tbe American Douse or Jay Cooke A Co., tor *M?7,ooo, on which the latter bad an oflset or $600,00?, leaving a balance In favor or tbe London house oi about $97,000. Hut, accoruin? to tte official re port, subsequent claims have been presented by this London bouse, wbicb entirely swallow np tne $600,000 due to tne American house and a great many thousands more. The toreign and American houses war by letters and numbers, Instead of the names of the interested parties, so that even now the relations oi the different houses are perfectly unintelligible to any but themselves, explaining them indisputably beiore courts of law in any way that will best advance ineir interests. After tbe London house has made its unexpected claim, the Secretary of tue Navy puts in another, according to tbe report, equally as unexpected and almost as great, so that it seems as lr there were a conspiracy to lm meatatelv swallow np all the avatlaole assets, aud leave the' army of patient, expectant creditors out in the cold. The report of the trustee might just as well never have been written; it give* no satlstactlon. It is weak, vague and visionary, and tne creditors are no more acquainted with their chauces of secnrlng their accounts than they were beiore it was penned. Briefly, it endeavors to t.tave off everything until, wearied by waiting and disappointment, the creditors will accept lor pay tne miserable lands of tbe Northern Pacific Rail way. Indeed, one of tbe lawyers of tbe former house oi Jay Cooke A C>. has already stated in public that if tbe claims preferred against the individual members of tbe firm are proven there wlil bo scarcely anything left lor the creditors. Regarding the present report lor what it Is worth, one learns that for many years beiore their failure tne firm of Jay Cooke A Co. were speculating upon other people's money, were dividing tbe profits among themselves and were yearly giving enormous amounts of money to their wives and cuiidren.
