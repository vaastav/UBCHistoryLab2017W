EATON, OHIO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1871. WHOLE NUMBER 241. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Third Annual Message of President Grant to Congress. Delivered December 4th, 1871. To the Senate and Hense of Renresentatives : In addressing my third annual mes sage to the law-making branch of the Government, it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year suc cess has generally attended the ffort to execute all the laws found upon the statute books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom ot laws al ready enacted, but to learn their spe cial intent, and to enforce them accord inely. The past year has, under the wisdom of a wise Providence,- been one of gen eral prosperity to the nation. It has, : however, been attended with more than the usual chastisements in loss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country, and to develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign nations, which goes far toward alleviating the distress occasioned bv the calamities. The be nevolent, who have generously shared their means, with these misiortunes, will reap their reward in the conscious ness of having performed a noble act, receiving the grateful thanks of the men, women and children, whose sui ferines thev have reliveed. The relation of the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an event ful one in witnessing two great nations, speaking one language, and having one lineage, settling, by peaceful arbitration, disputes of long standing and liable at any time to bring those nations into . bloody and hostile conflict. An exam ple has thus been Bet, which, if success nil in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and bo the final means of returning to productive in dustry millions of men maintained to settle the disputes ot nations by the bayonet and sword. I transmit here with a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has been concluded since the ad journment of Congress with Her Brit- amc Majesty, and a copy ot the pro tocols of the conferences of the Com missioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for ad justing the questions pending between the two nations. Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. 1 recom mend Congress at an early day to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at Geneva, and for the several Commis sions on the part of the United States, called lor by the treaty. His Majesty, the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, have each con sented, on the joint request of the two Powers to name an arbitratory for the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with which the "joint request has been complied with by the appoint ment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Uermany, has been pleased to comply with the joint action of the two Governments, and has consented to act as the arbi trator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between themselves certain princi ples of public law for which the United States have contended from the com mencement of their history. They have also agreed to bring these princi ples to the knowledge of the other maritime powers, and to invite others to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invitatian is to be extended to the Powers. I recommend the legis lation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to the other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North Ameri can possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and -its possessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become opera tive before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrange ments for the coming season. "Without exceeding the number of men or of expenditures authorized by law, during the past year, the navy has, in addition to Its regular service, supplied the men and officers for the vessels of the Coast Survey, and has completed the surveys authorized by Congress of the Isthmus of Darien and Tehaunte pec, and, under like authority, has sent out an expedition, completely furnished and equipped, to explore the unknown ocean of the North. The suggestions of the report as to the necessity for in creasing and improving the material of the navy, and the plan recommended for reducing the personnel of the service to a peace standard, by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the em ployment of some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considered and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all promotions in the navy above the rank .ptain be by selection instead of by priorit, This course will secure in the j r S'des greater efficiency, and hold an inceutive to young officers to improve them in the knowledge of their profession. Tne preSent cost of maintaining the navy its cost com pared with that of the prellli Ld the estimates for tETSfS' are contained in the accompanying re' port of the Secretary of the Navy. The enlarged receipts of the Po'tst Of- fice Department, as shown by the ac companying report of the Postmaster General, exhibits gratifying increase in the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the people two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of reoublics. With vast ter ltory like ours much of it sparsely populated, but all requiring the services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this Department can be made self-sustaining ; but a grad ual approach to this end, from year to jm; ia vonnuenuy relied upon, and the dny is not far distant when the Post Office Department of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. , The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the De partment presided over by him, are earnestly recommended to your special attention ; especially to the documents favorable to the consideration of the plan for uniting the telegraph system of the United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced and the service as well, if not better rendered. It would secure the further advantage by extending the telegraph through portions of the coun try where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above all, the efforts to bring a people widely separated into a community of interests, are always benehtted by a rapid intercommunication. Education, the groundwork of republican institu tions, is encouraged by increasing the facilities for gathering speedy news from all parts of the country. The de sire to reap the benefit of such rmprove ments will stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of tho operations of last year, and for comparative state ments of the results with former years. There has been imposed upon the Exe cutive branch of the Government the execution of the act of Congress, ap proved April 20, 1871, and commonly known as the " Ku-Klux law," in a por tion of the State of South Carolina. The necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the committee appointed to investigate the Southern outrages. Under the provi sions of the above act, I issued a procla mation, calling the attention of the people of the United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance to exercise any of the extraordinary powers there by conferred upon me, except in the case of an imperative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the Con stitution and the law. After the passage of this law informa tion was received, from time to time, that combinations of the character re ferred to in this law existed, and were powerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certain counties in the State of South Carolina. Careful investigation was made, and it was as certained that in nine counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient portion of the citizens to control the local authority, and having, among other things, the object of depriving the emancipated class of the substan tial benefits of freedom, and of privi lege, and the free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views. Among their operations were frequent scourgings and occasional assassinations, generally per petrated at night by disguised persons, the victims, in almost all cases, being citizens of different political sentiments from their own, or free persons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well-disposed citi zens were the sufferers by this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the 13th of October, 1871, a proclamation was is sued, suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, in nine counties in that State. Direction was given that within the counties so designated per sons supposed, upon creditable infor mation, to be members of such unlaw ful combinations, should be arrested by the military forces of the United States, and delivered to the Marshal, to be dealt with accordiug to law. In two of the said counties (York and Spartans burg) many arrests have been made. At last account the number of pereons : thus arrested was 1C8. Several hun dred whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were re leased for the present. These have generally made confessions of -their guilt. Great caution has been exer cised in making test arrests. Notwith standing the large number, it is be lieved that no innocent person is now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in tho judicial trib unals of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vig-' orous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all such persons nave Deen violating ins taw. -A full report of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General. In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbarism repugnant to civilization, decency and the laws of the United States. Territorial officers, however, have been found who are willing to per form their duty in a spirit of equity, and with a due sense of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither polygamy, nor any other violation of existing statutes, will be permitted within the territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the self-sty ed " saints " that we are now dealing, but with their practices. They will be pro tected in the worship of God according to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion, it may be advisable for Congress to con- I sider what, in the execution of the laws against polygamy, is to be the status of the plural wives and their offspring. The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act, authorizing the Territorial Legislature of Utah to legitimatize all children born prior to a time fixed in the act might be justified by its human ity to those innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recom mendation. The policy pursued toward the In dians has resulted favorably so far as can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation. Through the exertion of the various societies of Christians to whom has been entrusted the execution of the policy, and the Board of Commissioners authorized by the law of April 10, 1869, many tribes of Indians have been in duced to settle upon reservations, to cultivate the soil and perform product ive labor of various kinds, and to par tially accept civilization. Thev are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing a their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. I recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy, not only because it is humane, Christian-like and eco nomical, but because it right. I recom mend to your favorble consideration, also, the policy of granting a territorial government to the Indians in the In dian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. In do ing so every right is guaranteed to the Indians by the treaty. I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted herewith, to the Governors of New York, Penn sylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illi nois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the Governments of those States, respec tively, the necessary action on their part, to carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty which contem plates the use of the canals on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boun dary, in terms of equity, by the inhabi tants of both countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object and the benefits to flow therefrom, will se cure the speedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true position of the 49th parallel of latitude, where it forms the boundary between the United States and the British North American possessions between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The early action of Congress in the recommendation named would put it in the power of the War Department to place a force in the field during the next summer. The resumption of diplomatic rela tions between France and Germany has enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended to the Germans in France by the diplo matic and consular representatives of the United btates in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the Minister and Consul at Paris, and the various Consuls in France, under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness, as well as with prudence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of the German Govern ment, and has wounded no susceptibil ity of the French. The Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to manifest a friend ly feeling toward the United States, and a desire to harmonize with the mode rate and just policy with this Govern ment . maintains with the Asiatic Powers, as well as with the South American Republics. I have given assurance that the friendly feelings of that Government - are fully shared by the United States. The ratification of the consular and naturalization connec tions with the Austrian Empires have been exchanged. I have been officially informed of the annexations of the States of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal ot the capital of that Kingdom to Rome. In con formity with the established policy of the United States, I have recognized this change. The ratification of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy has been ex changed, and the Powers have agreed in their treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two Powers. The United States have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. The Forty-hrst Congress, at its third session. made an appropriation for the organiza tion of a mixed commission of adjudica tion upon the claims of the citizens of the United btates against Spam, crow ing out of the insurrection in Cuba. that Commission has since been organ ized. I transmit herewith the corres pondent relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to bo hoped that this Commission will afford the claim ants a complete remedy for their inju ries. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washington, between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the allied South American Republics, which has resulted in an armistic, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace. The intimate and friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continues un disturbed. The visit of the third son of the Russian Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his Government to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable re ception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proef that on our side we share the wishes of that govern ment. The inexcusable course of the Rus sian Minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask for his recall, and to decline to longer receive that function ary as a diplomatic representative. It was impossible, with self-respect, or with just regard to the dignity of the coun try, to permit Mr. Catacazy to hold in terviews with this government after his abuse of government officials, and dur ing his persistent interference, through various means, with the relations be tween the United States and other pow ers. In accordance with my wishes, our government has been relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the management of the affairs of the Imperial nation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely unobjec tionable. With Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. The Cabinet of thei Mikado has since the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of importance in several departments of the Government. I have reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pursued toward Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterest ed and just policy with China as well as Japan. The correspondence transmit ted herewith shows that there is no dis position on the part of this Government to swerve from its established course. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our ship wrecked sailors on the Corean coast, I instructed our Minister at Pekin to en deavor to conclude a convention with Corea for securing the safety and huj mane treatment of such mariners. Ad, miral Rogers was instructed to accom a a pany him with a sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A small surveying party sent out, on reaching the coast, was treacherously attackedat a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apology, for the insult. Neither come. A force was then landed. After an arduous march over a rugged and difficult coun try, the forts from which the outrages had been committed were gallantly as saulted, and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the honor of the flag, the expedition returned, finding it imprac ticable, under the circumstances, to conclude the desired convention. I re spectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto, herewith submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see fit to take. The national debt has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,826.80 during the year, and by the negotiation of na tional bonds at a lower rate of interest, the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that the sum to be raised for interest account is nearly $17,000,000 less than on the 1st of March, I860. It was highlv desirable that this rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their ability to entirely meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them ; but in view of the accomplish ment of these desirable ends, of the rapid development of the resources of the country, its increasing ability to meet the large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the coun try should continue to be taxed in or der to continue this rapid payment. I, therefore, recommend a modification of both the internal tax laws. I recom mend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spirituous wines and malt liquors, to bacco in its various forms, and from stamps. In readjusting the tariff, I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue col lected under the present law after pro viding for the current expenses of the Government, the interest account, and sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles not produced at home, such as medicines and com pounded essences, from which very lit tle revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made upon those articles which can bear it without disturbing home production or reducing th wages of American labor: I have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws for collecting the revenues pay the Collectors of Customs small salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at the principal ports of entry particularly raise the compensation of these officials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out inducement to dishonest men, should such get pos session of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this subject. Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, compared with the national cur rency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the country in keeping up prices of all arti cles necessary in every-day life. It fos ters a spirit of grumbling prejudicial alike to national morals and the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to get a fixed value to our currency,- that value constantly and uniformly approaching her with specie, very desirable object will be gained. For the operations of the army in the past year, the expense of maintaining it, the estimates for the ensuing year, and for continuing sea-coast and other improvements conducted under the su pervision of the War Department, I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War. I call your at tention, to the provisions of an act of Congress approved March 3, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corps of the army until provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers in each grade of the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the num ber in any one grade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be fixed by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant, the place may be filled by selec tion from the corps in which the vacan cy exists. The report of the Secretary of the Navy chows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force, without material increase in the expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and is being extended as fast as our ma terial will admit, of using smaller ves sels as cruisers on the several stations. By these means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more frequent ly the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable, and generally to dis charge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace. It has been the aim of the Admistra tion to enforce honesty and efficiency in all public affairs. Every public ser vant who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If bad men have secured places it has been the fault of the system established by law and custom of making appointments, or the fault of those who recommend for Government positions persons not sufficiently well known to them per sonally, or who give letters indorsing the character of office seekers, without proper sense of the grave responsi bilities which such a course devolves upon them. A- Civil Service Reform which can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercantile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of re commendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally responsible for the integrity of his friend, and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformation which would enforce this principle against all indorsers of persons for pub lic place, would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutary lesson has boen taught the careless and the dishonest servant in the great num-' ber of prosecutions and convictions in the last two years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proved recreant to the trusts confided to them, and in the elevating to public office none but those who possess the confidence of the honest and virtuous, who, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the community in which they live. In my message to Congress one year ago, I urgently recommended a reform in the civil service of the country. In conformity with that re commendation, Congress, in the ninth section of an act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the govern ment and for other purposes, approved March 3, 1871, gave the necessary au thority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil service reform, and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so. Un der the authority of said act, I convened a board of gentlemen eminently quali fied for the work, to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are not yet completed, but it is believed that they will succeed in devising a plan which can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, the heads of departments and members of Congress, and which will redound to the true interest of the public service. At all events the experiment shall have a fair trial. Under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved February 21, 1871, a Territorial Government was organized in the District of Columbia. Its results have thus far fully realized the expecta tions of its advocates. Under the di rection of the territorial officers, a sys tem of improvements has been inaugu rated by which Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the nattonal capital, the citizens of the District hav ing voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of con tributing to the advance of the seat of government. I recommend liberal ap propriations on the part of Congress in order that the Government may bear its just share of the expense of carrying out the various systems of improvement. By the great fire in Chicago, the most important of the'government buildings in that city were consumed. Those burned had already become inadequate to the wants of the government in that growing city, and looking to the near future, were totally inadequate. I re commend, therefore, that an appropria tion be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the square on which thejburned building stood, provided it can be purchased at a lair valuation,' and provided the Legislature of Illinois will pass a law authorising its condemna tion for Government purposes, and also an appropriation of as much money as can properly be expended towards the erection of new buildings during the fiscal year. I have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during the last year, and made such sugges tions as occur to me to be proper for your consideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined action will be wise, statesmanlike and in the best interest of the whole com U. S. 

GRANT, President. EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 4, 1871. Ladies, Stand Up. In view of the demand for female suffrage, it is proposed that the follow ing political catechism for ladies desir ous of entering the arena of politics be propounded, for answers, to all candi dates : What is the best seasoning for ballot box stuffing ? In opening a marking list, would you use silk or worsted ? Do you consider election-eering the jewelry of the campaign ? Would you measure the canvass of a ward by the yard ? Is it " measures, not men," that you desire ? Do you consider caucuses Irishmen from Cork? Would you stand up to vote a motion down? Would you propose musk or cologne when the scents of the meeting was called for ? Ought a chip hat to be worn in log rolling for an election ? Are you too modest to press the ques tion ? Are you familiar with the music of political organs ? What sort of a vehicle is a political hack? How old must a woman be to be en titled to the right of suffer-age ? Are good teeth requisite for stump speeches? Do you believe in the doctrine, " to the victor belongs the spoils," and, if so, do you consider a man spoils in po litical life? Would yu sit on a standing commit tee? Would you insist on having your weigh when the vote was declared to be a light one ? Boston Commercial Bulletin. A curious fact is related of the Maine wood-choppers, who, in the winter months, while felling trees amid snow and ice, cannot wear close-fitting boots, but very large sizes, that allow their feet to slip to and fro, thus creating friction and warmth. But from this they have their feet completely en crusted with corns. In the spring, when they raft their logs, they do not change their clothing or boots for weeks, until they arrive at the saw-mills. All the while their feet havebeen saturated with water, and when the boots are re moved the corns fall off like nutshells from the kernel. A wealthy young farmer in another county, says the Zanesville Courier, made a vow at the time of his marriage, that he would plant forty peach or apple trees for each child born during the first ten years of his married life. He has been married seven years, and has about 320 trees. He talks about going back on his vow. He hasn't the land to spare. Among the competitors for the darn ing prize lately offered in the Georgia State Fair one lady presented a stocking so neatly mended that the judges couldn't find the mark of a needle about the darned thing. A Man Falls Dead and Revives Again. From the Virginia City (Nev.) Enterprise, Nov. 10th. A new importation to this city kicked up such a row about town night before last that the police and many others be gan to think about half the people in town were dropping down dead in their tracks. First, a man had dropped down dead at a house on such a street, then a man had fallen down in a dying condi tion in another place, and soon it was in another place that a man " lay dying." At length it was discovered that one man was doing all the dying. He had then died about half a dozen times, and had been as often restored to life that he was almost too drunk to die naturally. He first went into a house on D Street, took a fit and fell so dead that with all the stimulants that could be poured down his gullet he refused to come to life until the woman of the house be came half frightened out of her wits, and blew her whistle for a policeman, when lo ! a miracle, the dead man got upon his pins and ran away. He next went into another house of the same class and the same street and died there, falling headlong to the floor with such utter abandon as to shake the whole house. The women were terribly frightened ; they poured water on his face, bathed his head, and as fast as he revived a little, turned brandy (the only thing besides whisky or gin that he could swallow) down his throat. He went for brandy like a kitten after new milk, and as soon as he had swallowed all in sight relapsed in the hope of ti ing revived again with the congenial resuscitator. Finding that a physician had been sent for, he recovered, and got out of the house. When he next fell dead we do not know, but during the night he went to Storr's dance house, on South C Street, and fell, dead as a door-nail. Water outside and brandy inside, with talk of bringing in a policeman, sat him on his pins, and he departed. He afterward went to Evan's chop-house, corner of C and Union streets, and, going back to the filter, drew a glas3 of water, and, while trying to drink, took two or thre steps backward, jumped high in the air, then came down like a thousand of brick between two tables, to the great con sternation of the two waiters. There he lay at full length, his head thrown back, and only the whites of his eyes visible, to all appearance as dead as a door-nail. The boys sopped him and mopped him with cold water, rubbed his head, and did all they could for him, but he was to all appearance stone dead. His face was white, no pulse could be felt, and his eyes were set in his head with not a bit of" speculation" in theml One of the waiters was about going for a doctor, when the dead man suddenly lifted his head and, began laughing."" Leavings the dumfounded waiters, he stalked away, no doubt to die in som place where his favorite revivers were more likely to be found. Those who saw his performance and assisted in restoring him, say that they would have sworn that he was dy ing and then a dead man, not believing such a piece of acting possible with any human being. He seemed, they say, to have the power of instantly stopping the beating of his pulse, and of chang ing the healthful appearance of his face to the pallor of death. A Rare Relic. A rare relic has been sent to Bologna, in Italy, by Prince Piombino, an Italian nobleman, which is to be placed on pub lic exhibition at the International Con gress of Archaeologists, who are shortly to meet in that city. This relic is the skeleton of a petrified man which has long been in possession of the Prince's family. The historical origin of this skeleton is unknown ; it is only known that it was sent as a gift to Pope Greg ory XV.; but the members of the Prince's family assert their knowledge of the fact, according to the family tra ditions, that this precious gift was brought to Rome and presented to Pope Gregory XV. by a Japanese deputation. During the days of this Pontiff the skeleton was exposed to public inspec tion ; but it was somewhat mutilated at this time by sight-seers. From that time forth the chest containing the skeleton was hermetically sealed. The interior of the chest was lined with vel vet, while the outside was covered with skin and gilded clasps, and with the papal arms engraved upon the key cover. Since that time the skeleton has never been shown to the public, having been kept under took, and key in the chest. Bacon Answered. Most towns of any pretension possess one or more inhabitants specially odi ous to all the rest, by having, as the Irishman said of them, " very winning ways to make himself hated." This disagreeable pre-eminence was possessed to a high degree, in a certain town in Vermont, by a man named Bacon. One winter day Mr. Bacon was bor ing a butcher of the village in his shop, when in strolled a well-known doctor of divinity to make a purchase. Mr. Bacon forthwith left the butcher and turned his banter upon the cler gyman. " Can you tell me, Doctor ," said he, placing his hand on a frozen porker which was stretched full length near by " Can you tell me, sir, why the head of this hog is called a minister's facer1 " I will try, sir, if you will tell me whv this (the other extremity) is calied bacon," was the ready reply of the doctor, and exit Mr. Bacon in bad odor. Australian Preserved Meat. Experiments have recently been made in England on the comparative econo my ot using Australian preserved meat and butcher's meat. Australian meat is prepared without bone, and is sold in a cooked state in England at from twelve to fourteen cents a pound. A leg of mutton costing nineteen cents a pound, weighed before roasting nine pounds and ten ounces, and after roast ing six pounds and twelve ounces. The weight of the cooked meat was four pounds and thirteen ounces, of the bones one pound and thirteen ounces, and of the gravy ten ounces. At this rate a slice of roast mutton in England costs thirty-eight cents a pound. From Punch. Chicago Rediviva.

Hanx turned States evidence. He says there were nine engaged in the gang, but one was killed in a recent attack on a stage. Officers are now in pursuit of the remainder of the gang. As the mail stage from Rockland to Belfast (Me.) was passing through Rock port, recently, a large hog that was in the road rushed at the team, caught the leader's hind leg in his mouth and bit it severely, tearing the flesh and tendons in such a manner as to spoil the horse.

Farmers who have large amounts of corn do not realize what quantities rats will take away to their nests and stor ing places. Thousands of bushels are annually consumed by the pests, and as it is the small drainages usually which take off the profit of farming, the mat ter of securely storing corn should be attended to. An exchange gives an account of the work of rats in a hardware store, from which something of an estimate can be made. Forty-five pounds of choice white pop-corn was left in a box on the floor, near the centre of the store. Next morning the box was nearly empty, and upon examination it was found that during the night the rats conveyed off thirty-one and two-thirds pounds of the corn, and concealed it in three different parts of the building. About ten pounds were taken through a small hole in the door between the store and the warehouse, some of which wps con cealed under the stairs in that part of the building, while four pounds were carried up the stairs composed of', twelve steps and hid away in a pile of paper rags lying on the floor of the second story of the warehouse. The rats evidently worked faithfully all night, and no doubt chuckled hugely next day over the princely supply of corn laid away for the wintei's use.
