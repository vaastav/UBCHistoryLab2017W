Tho following rules for the preserva tion of the teeth received the prize of fered by tho Odontographic Society pf rmimiciipnia: Cleanse your teeth once, or oftcner, every day. Always clease them before retiring at night. Always pick the teeth und rinse tho mouth after eating. Cleansing the teeth consists in thor oughly removing every particle of for eign substance from the teeth and gums. To cleanse, use well-made brushes, soft quill or wood toothpicks, an antacid styptic tooth wash, and precipitated chalk. If these means fail, apply to a reliable dentist. Always roll the brush up and down, lengthwise of the teeth, by which means you may avoid injuring the gums and necks of the teeth, and more thorough ly cleanse between them. Never use a dentrifrico containing acid, alkali, charcoal, soap, suit, or any gritty or powerful detersive substance. Powders anil pastes generally aro ob jectionable. They injure the gums and soft parts of the teeth, aud greatly as sist in forming tartar. A wash, proper ly medicated Bnd carefully prepared, is pleasanter and more beneficial. It dis solves the injurious secretions and de psits,and the whole is readily removed with the brush and water. Avoid eating hot food. Thoroughly masticate and insalivate the food before swallowing it. Frequent indulgence in sweetmeats, etc., between regular meals disturbs the process of digestion, and a vascid secretion is deposited in the mouth (from tho stomach), which is very injurious to the teeth. Never allow any one to extract a tooth, or to dissuade you from having them filled.unless absolutely necessary. Many so-called dentists, actuated by selfish motives, advise extracting, anil siior i lice teeth which competent opera tors can render serviceable for many years. Carelessness and procrastination are responsible for .a large majority of teeth that are lost. A Pittsburgh editor has been tried for libel, found guilty, sentenced to pay a thousand dollars and put in prison for a year; and thus tho grim question of how he was to get through a hard winter is happily solved.

Statement of Ensign Young. Ensign Lurtrn Young, the senior surviving officer, make the following statement: Left Hampton Roads atiout eleven o'clock, a. m., Friday, and steamed out In charge of a pilot. The pilot left at one o'clock. I had the afternoon watch. A stiff breese and a heavy sea Was running from the southeast; took departure at 1 :2ft from Cape Henry light, bearing west by south, distant about live miles, and south by east three-fourths east; unbent the chains and secured the anchors for sea; about two o'clock made all plain sail ; wind hauled mre to the south and took In topsail ; four o'clock the wind Increasing, also sea In creasing and the ship rolling to leeward alHmt ten degrees. I was relieved by Ensign Dan ner about four o'clock. About eight o'clock Mr. Dsnner told me that the jll and flying Jib stays were carried away, and tho wind' was blowing a gale; went to bed about 8:); was roused about midnight by the (Juartormaster calling Mr. French ; liearu Mr. French ask him the state of the weather; the Quartermaster replied: "Bad." I dored off again nd was re-roused about 1 : 10 by the thumping of the ship, when she struck bottom hard. The Captain sung out ss he came out from the cabin : " Hard down." I put on a coat and pair of pants, ran on deck and found that it was blowing a fresh gale; heard tho order: " Brail up the mainstay sail," and assisted but could not take It In then; asked the Captain if we should throw the guns overboard. He said: " Yes, do It as quick as possible." (Jot the permanent tackles hooked to the lee gun, but could not remove It because she had bilged, and could not get it over for the sea. The Captain then ordered me to bum all the sig nals I could. In the meantime all the port boats and cutter had been carried away, the ship was lying on her port, bilged broadside at an Incline of about 40 deg. and the sea breaking clear over her; went Into the cabin and saved two boxes of coaster light; sent up Ave rockets and burnt over 100 signals; the sea was then staving in the cabin very rapldlv, ami when I heard the word given for all nands to go forward as quick as possible I hurried the Quartermasters who, were with me and some other men to go forward; as I passed the cabin door Mr. French asked me If that was alii I told him yes; then he said we must f;o quick. We all started together. I had' a mid on a Catling gun when a verv heavy sea eamo over and washed mvself and aliout Are others down to the leeward, and all but myself went under the sail, and they were drowned. I wo caught In the bag of the sail and hurt both legs against the gaff; regained the gear of a nine-Inch gun and worked myself forward; thought I saw Mr. French go with main rigging; saw a number of men standing in the starboard gangway and on the first launch, and a numlier of men under the main-top-gallant forecastle. I succeeded In getting on the top-gallnnt fore castle with the assistance of the men there A numlier of men had on life-preservers and one rubber balsa was rigged on the fore castle. The top-gallant forecastle was full of men and officers. Two or three men lashed themselves to the bowsprit. Everyone was perfectly cool and showed no signs of fear. The maioritv of us flrot close toirether on the upper side of the forecastle, suffering much from cold and' exposure. The seas would break clear over us and nearly suffocate us. Mr. Conway, watch officer, had on a blanket, and shared it with Mr. Danner, Mr. Loomis and myself. We sounded over the side and found aliout six feet of water. A little while after we sounded again and got seven and a half and eight feet; saw llirhts aliout one point on starboard bow and we gave three cheers and repeated them several times. We then saw that the flood tide was breaking over us worse. We here saw the first launch, the only boat left, stove in and knock Capt. Ryan and the navigator overboard; saw two men killed on the forecastle. Mr. Uonway suggested: tnat we make some effort to get a line on shore. 1 said I would attempt it, and called for men to put the balsa over, when a three-inch line was made fast to the balsa and the same low ered overboard, but it fouled with the Jibboom forcguard and other spars and got down on the torpedo spars; worked about ten minutes to clear balsa, and called for some one to help me. Mr. Danner came down part of the way and said he was too weak and could not get on. I then told him that it was our only chance and we had better try. Hesaid he could not, or he would see in a little while. Williams, a seaman, came down and said he would go in atiout ten minutes. We succeed ed in irettinp the balsa clear of the soars. 1 could get no main line, and the First Lieuten ant, Mr. Simons, Mr. White and manv others in the forecastle sung out to me: "The line is out: cut it and get on shore if possible for as sistance." I had a small pen-knife, but could not open it because my hands were benumbed. Williams opened it and I succeeded In cutting the rope; was then struck several times by spars, once in the small of the back and across ttie inns, we thought the beaxui ran per pendicular to the ship. It was foggy and we could not see the shore. When the line was cut the balsa went toward the Btern of the ship, and we thought we were going to sea. one thing that deceived the maioritv of the ship's company. Wo paddled the balsa wnn pieces oi paneling, wear me stern of the ship a heavy surf struck us and carwlzed the balsa end for end. My leg being jammed, it had me under neath the water for a while. Both re gained the balsa, when I .'old Williams we would then steer the balsa in fear of another capsize. We were thrown over ag.xin, and the catastrophe threw w Uliams aliout ten leet, Mv arm being lammed, I was thrown on mv back. Wheu we came up again it was rather still water, i swam and pusncd tne oaisa toward Williams. He got on top and stood up and looked around, and said that he saw the masts of fishing vessels ahead, which proved to be telegraph poles on shore. I told him we would steer for it. We capsized twice more, and before we knew it we were on the beach.- I told him to haul the balsa up, as we might want to use it to send off to the ship. Landed about three-quarters of a mile up the beach from the wreck; found two men Inside the surf, hut too weak to get up; went down and palled them up. I then ran to the first house I saw, but found no one in it; started down the beach as fast as I could, mv legs hurting mo very badly; found ten or fifteen people from the shore standing oppo site me wrecK looKiug at it. i roiu mem to go further up the beach and do all they could to save the men, as they apieared to be land ing un there with a verv stronir current running up coast. We pulled out sev eral more men; l asked tuem where the life-saving station was; they said one was seven miles up the beach, and the other five miles down the beach. Saw a man on horseback, and sent him to tho upper station lor am ana to teicgrapn to w asning ton for assistance to the wreck. This was about seven o'clock a. m. Then saw Mr. Con way, who had been landed. Asked these men on shore why the life-car was not there. They told me that the life crew of thirteen were at Roanoke Island.

This was almost eleven o'clock a. m. Sheriff Bunklev then In vited us to his house.

The next morning one of the men reported two men-of-war and a wrecking steamer in the oiling. We went im mediately to the station and 1 tried to call the attention of the ship with a larire blue flair. but could not. Then I went up to a point op posite me wrecK aim Iounu tne leiegrapu op erator flagging the wrecking steamer.

The Swatara tried to signal us, but without glasses I could not read it. At one o'clock a relief party under command of Lieut.

NORFOLK, Nov. 27. Several of the surviving seamen Interviewed make tne following statement: ine Vessel was heading her course south-southeast, the wind blowing strong from south-southeast, under after sail to steady her, and steaming aiong. mere was no event to excite appre hensions of any danger. Master W. J. French had the deck. She had sighted and passed Currituck light aud orders were glveu to keep a bright lookout for Body' Island light. At 1 : 40 the vessel struck, w heu all bands rushed on deck. Capt. Ryan aud the officers acted prompt ly. The crew rusiouded to all orders with also rlty. The surf was Uu rlrtc - Shortly after the vessel struck a boat was lowered, hut Im mediately swamped. The vessel slewed broad side to the sea, which made a clean break over her, sweeping everything from tho decks and errylng the boat' from the davits. Many sea: men anu ouicers were wasneq ovcrnoarn, and several were killed by piece of the wreck. Cspt. Ryan and Lieut. Simmon were last seen together when the sea struck the vessel nd were swept awav. The vessel broke op fast. 1 ne uri neeame more and more furious, making It beyond all hitman efforts to hold on. It was dark. . Signals of dis tress had been made, but no resnonse re ceived. No one knew where they were, and all that did get ashore were washed there by the surf. The cause of the wreck Is attrib uted to local attraction of the compass and a strong current setting on the shore, which made tne vessel go tun Her to the southward than her compass course Indicated.

Dettenreiiler, a widow- laily of sixty two.living at Virginia City.Nev., learned that her son wan lying dangerously ill at Yellowstone Crossing, and at once set out to nurse him. She traveled by rail to Franklin, eighty-five miles north of Ogdcn, thence by stage without a halt to Virginia, Mont., 400 miles away, and to Hoem an, ninety miles further, the remaining thirty miles of her journey being done by vehicle, the whole trip taking nine days. She nursed her son for a month, and, though the Npz Terces were raiding in tho vicinity did not abandon her post. She was one of the first ettlers of Nevada, an ex perienced rifle shot, and acquainted with Indian warfare, and so " didn't scare worth a cent." Finding that her son got no better, she resolved, he be ing unable to stand the fatigue of a raii- rond Journey, to take him home herself, and so bought a wagon, span of horses and tent and set out for Virginia City, She camped out forty-six nights, this not including the nights spent where there were nouses, the cold being so great many nights that the streams and pools were covered with ice. rait of the time a young man accompanied them, but during the greater part of the journey the gray-haired mother was alone, having to care for the invalid, pitch the tent, attend to the horses and do all the work: oi driving, finally sne reached home in safety with her pre cious charge. Virginia (Nev.) Chron icle. An Extraordinary Affair. It certainly was an extraordinary afVair, and the parties interested will remember it as long as they live. The young lady was shopping in the even ing, un ner way iiume sue was over taken by a younET man, an acquaintance, who asked the pleasure of escorting her home. The oiler was accepted, and the two proceeded, he carrying her bundles, and making himself generally agreeable, as is the custom in such cases. Arriving at her home she took him direct into the sitting-room, as the parlor stove was not yet up. The father and mother were sit ting there, enjoying, evidently, the gen ial warmth of the fire. On their entrance the young man noticed that the mother blushed deeply, and at the same time her husband laughed outright. It was most boisterous laugh, without evident premeditation, and appeared to owe its origin to no assignable cause. The laugher gave no explanation after the ex plosion, but continued to look very much amused, while tho color in his wife's face deepened. To the young man this was a most embarrassing reception Naturally enough he felt that it was something in li is appearance that excited the mirth of the one and caused the blushes of the other. Involuntarily he took a hasty survey of his appearance as far as the circumstances would llov, but could perceive nothing therein cat dilated to upset the risibilities of any man or unduly agitate the bosom of any woman. Mill he was not at his ease, and the young lady discerning it, and failing to understand the action of her parents, proposed euchre as an onset. So the two ulaved. and the old centle- man continued to look amused, occa sionally varying this accomplishment by facetious winks at Ins wile, whose counte nance was alternately red and white. The voting man became so absorbed in the game that he forgot the peculiarity of ins reception, ana tne young uuiy, uiviu ing her attention between tne cards and his face, lost sight of the trouble. And so they played and played, while the si lence of the parents grew really oppress ive had the players but known it. But they made no note of it. They played on, and all interests were swallowed up in the game. An hour passed, and then a halt hour more. was now ten o'clock. As the hour struck the old gentleman looked up from his paper, in which he had been absorbed for some little time, glanced at the players, then upon the face of his wife, and immedi ately wen t off into such a fit of suppressed laughter that tho effort to control it very nearly precipitated mm into a case of apoplexy. Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, the players did not notice this agitation. Had they looked up they could not have failed to have noted the terribly distressed expression of the mother's face in which case the young man would have understood that some family misfortune made the presence of an outsider very unpleasant. A hall hour more passed. The young man threw down the cards and said he must go. The young lady having thoroughly enjoyed the game felt impelled to say to him, "Don't be in a hurry; it is early yet," and had almost uttered the fateful words when her glance encountered the stony expression upon her mother s face, and the words died upon her lips, while a thrill of fear shot through her heart. The young man took kis hat, turned to bid the family a pleasant good night, when his gaze also fell upon the face of the mother, and the same thrill pierced his heart. He withdrew without word, using all the haste possible, and went up the street to his home in a dazed state of mind. He learned accidentally a few days later the cause of it all. The old lady. having a severe cold, had taken the pre caution to soak her feet in hot water before retiring, and her feet were in the pail receiving" the proper treatment when tho young man was unexpectedly ushered in. As her skirts fell over the vessel .he failed to note the fact, and consequently prolonged his stay two solid hours, what the temperature of the water had become at that hour can easily be imagined, but what were the thought that passed through the mis erable woman s distracted mind during those two hours no one oun fathom. Even she finds herself unable to clearly define them, although she has talked of but little else since the awful night. Vunoury news.
