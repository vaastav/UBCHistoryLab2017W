We were asked bv the new 1 government to use our good oftlccs jointly I wiili those.qf European powers ill Um in- I wests of peace. Answer was made that i the esUiblSlfwl policies and tile true inter- I i-is of the United States forbade them to ' interfere in European questions, joint- I Iv with European powers. 1 ascertained ' innifllcially that the Government of i North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such representations from any 1 powers, and though earnestly wishing to I see Hie biasings of peace restored to the i bclligercnU, with all of whom the United t States lire on terms of friendship, I de- I dined on the part of this Government to < take a step which could only result in m- < jury to our truu interests, without advanc- i ing the object for which our intervention ' was invoked. Should the time come when 1 the action ol the United States can hasten I the return of peace by a single hour, that i action will be heartily taken. 1 deemed il prudent, in view of the number of per- I skim nf Herman and French birth living ' in tiie United States, to issue soon after ollleial notice of a state ol war had been 1 received from both belligerents, a procla- i illation defining the duties of the United i States as a neutral and the obligations of i IB-Ruins residing within their territory to i observe I heir laws and the laws of nil- ' lintis. The proclamation was followed by i (there, as circumstances seemed to call I lor litem. Thu people, thus acquainted, lu ailvaiice,,of their duties anil obligations, I linvn assisted in preventing violations ol i the neutrality of the United States. I It is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba lias materially I changed since the close ol the last session i oi Congress. i In an early stage ol the contest, the i ?'c,?i?t? .-(.,,1 | HUlllUriWCS ui apuiu IIIUUKUlmvu < aj oiwu of arbitrary arrests, of dose confinement niul of military trial anil execution of |iersons suajK-fU-'d ol complicity with tin* insurgents, and of summary embargo ?t their properties, and sequestration ol their revenues by Executive warrant. Such proceedings, bo far as they airectcd the IM'rsons or . properly of citizens of tho I'liiled States, were in violation of the provisions of the Treaty of 17115 between tin- United States and Spain. Representations of injuries resulting to several oersons claiming to bo citizens of the United States, by reason of such violations, were made to the Spanl>h government. From April, 1801), to June last, the Spanish Minister at Washington bad been clothed with a limited power to aid in redressing such wrongs. That power was found to In- withdrawn, in view, as it was said, ol tIk* favorable situation in which the Island ot Cuba then was; which, however, did n?t lead to a revocation or sus|>cnsion ot tlieevtraordlnniy nnd arbitrary functions exercised by tho executive power in Cuba, and we were obliged to make our complaints at Madrid. In tho negotiations thus opened and pending then! the United States only claimed that for the future the rights secured to their citizens l?v treaty should be respected in Cuba, and that ns to the past a joint tribunal'should be established in the United States, with full jurisdiction over nil such claims. Before such impartial tribunal, each claimant would required to prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case which at one time threatened seriously to affect the relation* between the United States and Spain, has already been lisposed ol In this way. Tho claim of the owners of tho "Col. Lloyd Aspinwall" lor the illegal seizure and detention ol that vessel, was referred t?? arbitration by mutual conscnt, nnd lias resulted in an award to the United States for the owners ot the sum, of $19,>.\50 in gold. Another nnd nlongpending claim of like nature, that ol the whale"hip Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitration during tlio present year, it was referred by tho joint con sent i if Brazil and the United States, to Hie decision ol Sir Edward Thornton, her Uriitunic Majesty's Ministernt Washington. who kindly undertook the laborious tll>k of examining tho voluminous mass "f correspondence and testimony submitted by the two Governments, nnd awarded to the United States the sum of one bun?jrwl thousand seven hundred and forty dollars and nine cents in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial Government These recent examples show that Uie mode which the United States have proposed to Spain lor adjusting tho pending claims Is just and feasiblo.and tuat it nu*y be agreed to by either nation with out dishonor. It ia to bo hoped that this I moderate demand may be acceded to by f Spain without further delay. Should the t pending negotiations unfortunately and t unexpectedly bo without result, it will t then become mv duty to communicate i that lact to Congress and Invite iu action 1 on the subject The long deferred peace conierence t between Spain and the allied South I American republics has been Inaugu- ! rated in Washington under the auspices t of the United States. 1'ursusntto the rec- i commendation contained in thu resolu- t tion ol the House of Representatives of i the 17tli ot December, 1800, the Executive t Department ol the Government oilered r its friendly offices for the promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and s the allied republics. Hesitations and ob- I stacles occurred to the acceptance of the \ offer. Ultimately, however, a conference a was arranged and was opened in this city on the 29th of October last, at r wlilch 1 authorized the Secretary t ol State to preside. It was attended 1 liy Uie Ministers of Bpaln, Peru, Chill and t Ecuador. In consequence ot the ab- I ience ol the representative from Bolivia, t the conference was adjourned until the at- c tendance of a plenipotentiary from that Republic could be secured, or other men- n Hires could be adopted towards com- i passing its objects. t The allied and other republics of t Spanish origin on this continent 1 may see in this fact a new proof of I mr sinccre interest in their welfare; of our t ileslretoseethemblessedwitlittgoodgov- t eminent capable ol maintaining order and ( i)l' preserving their respective territorial integrity, and of our sinccre wish to ex- a tend our own commercial anil social re- c lations with them. The time is not pro- [ liably liir distant when, in tho natural n order of events, the European political t connection with this continent will cease. ( Dnr iKilicy should be shaped in view of c this probability, so as to ally the cointncr- c {<il Interests of thu Spanish American ? States more closely to our own, and thus I: jive tlio United States all tho pre-etni- f tepee nnd all the advantage which Mr. ii Monroe, Mr. Adams and Sir. Clay con- t emulated when they proposed to join in I [lie Congress of Panama. c During tho last session ol Congress a t reaty for the annexation of tlio Republic of t Sail Domingo to the United States fulled to ii eceive the requisite two-thirds vote ol t be Senate. I was thoroughly convinced r hen'tlint the best interests of this country v ;ommcrcially and materially demanded iLs u atitication. Time has only confirmed I: nu in this view. I now llrmly lielievc c hat the moment it in known that the n United States have entirely abandoned the c he project of accepting as a part t il its territory the Island of San c Domingo, a free |iort will be nego- li iateil lor by European nations in n ho Hay of Samanu. A large commer- p :laI cily will Bpring up, lo which ive will be tributary without recelv- r ug corresponding beneills. And then I ivill tie seen the folly of rejecting c 10 great a prize. The government t it Sun Domingo has volsntarily sought e .hid annexation. It is a weak pow- t ;r, numbering probably less than one s inndred and twenty thousand souls, and , et possessing one of the richest territories c .inder the sun, capable ol supporting a a population ot ten millions of people, in 1. luxury. The people of San Domingo arc a not capable ot maintaining themselves in t [heir present coudition, and must look lor a lutside support. They yearn lor the pro- c lection of our free institutions and laws, >ur progress and civilization. Shall wu a rcluie them? c The acquisition of San Domingo is c lesirable because of its geographical tl position. It commands the entrance s :o the Carribcan Sea, and the Isth- b mis transit of commerce. It possesses tl ho richest soil, tho best and most r :apacious harbors, most salubrious ti limine and the most valuablo pro- t lucts ot tho forest, mine and soil I if any of tlie West India Islands. I Its possession by ns will, in a few years, c build up a coastwise commerce of Im- e incuse magnitude, which will go lar to- s wards restoring to us our lest merchant I murine. It will give to4us those articles t which we consume so largely and do not li produce, thus equalizing our exports and li imports. In casool torelgn war it will give li is command ol all tho islands referred to, c ind thus prevent nn enemy from ever n igain possessing himself of rendezvous c upon oar very coast. At present our I coast trade between the Slates bordering f nn the Atlantic and those bordering on li the Uulf of Mexico is cut in two by the ii Bahamas and the Antilles. Twice we 2 must, as il were, pass through foreign n countries to get, by sea, from Georgia to I :ho east coast of Florida. 1 San Domingo, with a stable government under which her immense re- h lourccs can be doveloped, will give c remunerative wages to teas of thou- g lands or laborers not now upon the is- g land. This labor will tako advantage C it every available means ot transportation li lo abandon the adjacent islands and seek b die blessings of freedom and Its sequence, g ?each inhabitant receiving the reward of o lis own labor. Porto Itico and Cuba will b iiave to abolish slavery, as a measure of o lelf-prcscrvation to retain thoir laborers, c Sail Domingo will become a largo consu- I nerof the products of northern tarms and t! manufactories. The chcap rate at which ti Iter citizens can be lurnisheil with fixxl, s :ools and machinery, will make it r lecessary that contlgnons Islands should li Imrc tlio same auvnnuigix, iu uruer w ?< xmipeto in Iku production of sugar, S entice, tobacco, tropical fruits, Ac. Tills tl will ojien to UK n still wiilcr mnrket lor v mr products. The production of our own il supply ol these nrtlclcs will cut otr more li tluin *100,000,000 ol our annual imports, J! liwides largely increasing our exports, d With such it picture, it is easy to seo how o 3ur large debt abroad is ultimately to lie I jxtinguwhed. With a balance ol c trade against us, (including interest tl of bonds held by foreigners, and the money spent by our citizens traveling In ? loreign lands) equal to the entire yield of ]f precious metals in this country, it is not (j #> easy to sec how this result is to be t otherwise accomplished. Tlio acquisition i, ;( Sa i Domingo is an adherence to the g Monroe Doctrine. It is a measure of ? national protection; it is inserting our f, list claim to a controlling Influence tl jver the great conimcreiai trntllc soon to ( low ln>m West to East by way of j, .he Isthmus of Danen; it is to build / ip our merchant marine; it Is to furnish ]i tew markets lor the prodttctsol out farms, n iho|is anil manufactories; It is to thako ? ilaveiy Insupportablo in Cuba and Porto (, Itlco at once, and ultimately bo in I!n)7.il; ? t is U> settle the unhappy condition of p L'ubo, and end an exterminating conllict; j t is tc provide tbo honest means of pay- j ng our u. ?st debts without overtaxing ? ihe [xnple; ,1 is to furnish our citizens ? with the necessaries of every day life at |, :hea|>er rates than ever belnrc; and it is, c in tine, a rapid stride towards that great- f, less which the intelligence, industry and ? nterprlse ot the citizens of tbo United tl Jtatcs entitle this country to assume t, imong nations. T In view ol the Importance of this d juestion, I earnestly urge upon Con- tl ;ress early action, expressive of Its * Hews ta to tbo best means of acqulr- h rig San Domingo. My Buggeatioa is, that ? >y joint resolution of the two houses of C Congress, the Executive be luthorized to i< ippoint n commission to negotiate a n reaty with the authorities of San Domin- si ro, for the acquisition of that o Island, that an appropriation be made c jn defrav tho expenses of such a commis- tl ilon. 1*110 question may tkon bo deter- o nlned by tho action of tho Senate g ipon tbu treaty or the Joint action ti >f tho two Houses of Congress i lpon a resolution of annexation as il I n the case of tho acquisition <>l Texas. v> convinced am I of tliu advantages to low from tbe acquisition ol San Domingo, ind or tho great disadvantages, I might ilraost say, calamities, to How from nunicquisition, that I believe the subject ias ooly to be investigated to be approved. It Is to be regretted that our rcpresentalons In regard to the injurious effccts, esKcially u|xm the revenue of tho United Jtates, of tlie policy of the Jieiican govTnment in exempting from import duties l large tract of its territory on our borlent, have not only been fruitless, but that t is even pro|wseu in that country to exend the limits within which tho privilege idvertcd to hus hitherto been enjoyed. Hie expediency of taking into your itIous consideration proper measures br countervailing the policy referred to, vill, it is presumed, engage your earnest ittuntlon. < It is the obvious interest, especially of lelghboring nations, to provide against imnunity to those who may have committed ilgh crimes within their borders, and who nay havo sought reftigo abroad. For this mrpose extradition treatiesluve been coniludtxl witli Bevcral of the Central Ameri:an Republics, and others arc in progress. Tho sense ot Congress is desired as early is may lie convenient upon the proceeungs ol the Commission on claims [gainst Venezuela, as communicated in ny messages of March l(lth, 180#, darch 1st, 1870, and March 81st 1870. t has not been deemed advisable to disrlbute any of tho money which lias been eceived from that government until Congress shall have acted on tho subject The massacres of French and liusttns residents at Tein-Tsin, under circumstances of grunt barbirity, were suptosed by sonio to have been premeditated, ml. to indicate a purpose among the popilace to exterminate foreigners in the Uhineso Empiro. The evidence lulls to stablish such a supposition, but shows a :omplicily between the local authorities md the mob. Thegovernmcnt at Pekin, lowever, seems to liavo been disposed to ultil its treaty obligutionsso far as it was ible to do so. Unfortunately the news of lie war between the German States and 'ranee reached China soon after tBe nassacre. It would appear that tho popilar mind became possessed with ho idea that this contest, extend: ng to Chinese waters, would neutralize the Christian influence and lower, and that the tiiuo was coming rhen the superstitious masses might expel ill foreigners and restore Mandarin nlluencc. Anticipating trouble from this ausc, I invited France and North Germany to make an authorized suspension f hostilities In the Kast, where they were empornrily suspended by act of the ommanders, nna to uet together for the uture protection in China of the lives ml properties of Americans and Euroleans. Since the adjournment 01 congress, uic iltificaLions of the treaty witu Great Iritain lor abolishing the mixed ourts for the suppression of the slave rade lmvo been exchanged. It is believd that the slave trade Is now confined to ha eastern coast of. Africa, whence tho laves are taken lo Arabian markets. The ratification ol tho naturalization onvention between Great Britain nd thu Unitod Slates has also een exchanged during the recess, nd thus a long standing disputo between he twogovcrnments has been settled in ccordance with the principles always ontended for by tho United States. In April last, while engaged In locating military reservation near Pembina, a orps of engineers discovered that the ommonly received boundary line between lie United States and the British possesIons at that place is about forty-seven uudred feet south of the true position of lie 49th parallel, and that the line, when un on what is now supposed to be tho ruo posltionof that parallel, would leave lio Fort of the Hudson Bay Company at 'embina within the territory of the Jnlted States. This information being ommuniented to the British Uovrnment I was requested to confnt, and dhl consent, that the Irltlsh occupation of tho port by the lndson Bay Company should continue :>r the present. I deem it Important, lowcver, that this part ol the boundary inc should be definitely fixed by a Joint oinmission of the governments, and 1 sublit herewith estimates ot the expense I such a commission on the part ot the Jnlted States,ami recommeudthatan apiropriation he made for that purpose. The mil boundary Inis already been fixed and narked from the Summit ot the Rocky iountains to the Georgian bay. It should ow be in like manner marked Iroin the ,ako of the Woods to the Summit of tho tocky mountains. I regret to say that no conclusion iss been reached for the adjustment f the claim against Great Britain, Towing out of the course udopted by that overnment during the rebellion. The labinet of London, so far as its views ave been expressed, docs not apoear to e willing to concede that Her Majesty's ovemment was guilty of any negligence, r did or permitted any act during the war y which the United States hud Just cause I complaint. Our firm and unalterable onviclions aro directly the reverse. , therefore, recommend to Congress to auliorizu the appointment of a commission to ike proof of the amounts and tho owner- ' liipot these several claims,on notice to the epresentativo of iler Majesty nt Washngton, and that authority bo given for the dtlenicnt ol these claims ny me unueti , ilnUs, so that the government ahull havo lie ownership of the private claims as j /ell us the responsible control of all the : ernonds against Great Britain. It cannot c necessary to add that whenever Her , lajesty's government shall entertain a , esire lor a full and friendly adjustment , f these claims, the United States will en- , er upon their consideration with an earnst di*i/o tor a conclusion consistent with . lie honor and dignity of both nations. , Tiie course pursued by tlio Canadian ail- I lioritles towards the fishermen of the Un- i led States during tho oust season has not i eon marked by a friendly feeling. By I lie first article of the convention of 181b, I etween Great Britain and tlio United | itates, It was agreed that the iriliabitants | I the United States should have I >rcver, in common with British subjects, < lie right of taking tlsh in certain waters | lierein defined. In the waters not included i i the limits named in the convention, i A-ithin three miles of parts of the ! Iritisli coast,) it lins been the custom for i mny years to give to intruding fisher- i ion of tho United States a reasona- : le warning of their violation of tho tech- I leal rights of Great Britain. The im- i erial government is understood to have i elegated the whole or a share ol its juris- i iction or control of these in-shorc fishing i rounds to the colonial anthority known i the Dominion of Canada, and this semi- i idependent but irresponsible agent has xercised its delegated powers in an un- i lendly way. Vessels havo been seized i without notice or wurning in violation ol te custom previously prevailing,and have ] ecn taken into tho colonial ports, their < oyages broken up, and the vessels conemned. There is reason to believe that i lis unfriendly and vexatious treatment ras designed to bear harshly upon tho ardy fishermen of tho United States, | ritb a view to political effect upon this lovernment Tho statutes of tho Dominm of Canada assumo a still broader and lore untenable Jurisdiction over tho viasis of tlie United Statei They authorize Ulcers or persons to bring vessels hovring within three murine miles of any ol bo coasts, b?ys, creeks or harbors 1 Canada, into port, to search the caro, to examine tho master, on oath, juchlng the cargo and voyage, and to ifilet upon him a heavy pecuniary penilty If trnc answers are not given; and If audi ti vesael in found preparing to Hah ti within three marine miles of luiy such V coasts, buys, creeks or harbors, without a b< license, or after the expiration or the period si named in the last license granted to it, they tc provido that the vessel, with her tackle, cl sc., shall be forfeited. It is not known it that any condemnations have been made b under this statute. Should the authorities B of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will tl become my duty to take such steps us w may be necessary to protect the rights of b the citizens of the United States. It has been claimed by Her Majesty's officers tc that the fishing vessels of the United ai States have no right to enter the open w ports of the Britisli possessions in North tl America, except for the purpose of shel- ai terund repairing damages, of purchasing b wood and obtaining water; that they have ei no right to enter at British Custom Hous- b es, or to trade, except in the purchase of a wood and water; and that they must de- b part within 24 hours alter notice to leave, d It is not known that any seizure of a ai fishing vessel carrying the Aug of the a United Stales has been made under this ir claim. So faros the cluim is founded on F an ulleged construction of the convention al of 1818, it cannot be acquiesced in by the d United States. It is hoped that it will c< not lie Insisted on by Her Majesty's Gov- li eminent. During theconference which pre- in ceded tho negotiations of 1818, tbo British fc commissioners proposed to expressly si excludo the fishermen of the United tc Slate from "the privilege of carry- ra ing on trade with any of Her Brit- fc tanic Majesty's subjects residing si within tho limiu assigned for their bi use; and also that it should not be lawful sc lor the vessels of the United States engag- in ed in such lialiery to have on board any in goods, wares, or merchandise, whatever, si except such us may be necessary lor the tr prosecution of their voyages to w and from Buid fishing grounds; si and any vessel ot the United Stales which si shall contravene this regulation may bo seized, condemned and confiscated, with D her cargo." This proposition, whicli a< is Identical with tho construction now put ni upon the language of tho Convention, is was emphatically rejected by the Amcri- tn can Commissioners and thereupon was fr abandoned by the British plenipo- u< tentiaries, and article one, as it stunds ui in the Convention, was substituted, di If, however, It be said that this claim rc is founded on provincial or colouial hi statutes and not. upon the Convention, ti this Government cannot but regard tliom sii as unfriendly, and in contravention of the tc spirit if not of tho letter ot the treaty for di the faithful execution ol which uiq imperial rc Government is alone responsible. An- In ticipating that an attempt may possibly ol be made by the Canadiun authorities iu ol the coming season, to repeat their un- la neighborly acts towards our fishermen, I st recommend youtoconfer upon tho Execu- vi live the power to suspcud by proclama- tli tion the operations ol the laws author- d< izing tho transit ot goods, wares and mcr- 1 chandize in bonds across the territory tli of the United States to Canada; und pi further, should finch an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend tho opera- tii tion of any laws wliereby tho Vessels D of tho Dominion of Oanada are permitted tli to enter tho waters of the United States. io A like unfriendly disposition bus been munilested on the pari of Canada in tiie '? maintohuuice ot a claim of right to ex- jl cludo the citizens of Uie United States I" from the navigation of tho St Lawrence. "] This river constitutes a natural outlet to >' the ocean for eight States with anaggrc- I gate population of about 17,000,000 inhab- m Slants, und with an aggregate tonnage of 001,807 tons upon tho wuters which dis- m charge with it. The loreign commerce of our portB on these waters, is open to British competition, and the major part of it is done in British or bottoms. If tho American seamen P! bo excluded from tho natural avenue to the ocean, tho monopoly of tho a direct commerce ol the luko ports with f? tho Atlantic would be in foreign hands, 10 their jteasels on trans-Atlantic voy- "a ages having an access to our lake ports, nI which would bo denied to American ves- I" sols, on similar voyages. To statu such a proposition is to relute its justice. During w tho Administration of Mr. .lolin Quincy tli Adams, Mr. Clay unanswerably dom- fo onslralcd the national right ol tho citizens re of the United States to the navigation of o[ this river, claiming that the act of the in Congress of Vienna, in opening tho Rhine in and other rivers to till nations, show- m ed tho judgment of European jurists kt and statesinun to be that tho Inhabitants ol Tl a country through which a navigable river ci passes have a natural right to enjoy the pr navigation of that river to and into the w sea, even though passing through the ter- w ritory of another power. This right does C< not cxcludu the co-equal right of the w sovereign possessing the territory through at which the river debouches into the sea, to make such regulations relative to the be policy of the navigation, as may be rcasonably ncccssaryj but those regulations ou should be framed in a liberal spirit ol coin- j,, ily, and should not impose needless burdons u|Kin the commcrco which lius the ?{ right of transit. It has been found in rc practice more advantageous to arrange m these regulations by mutual agreement. n|| The United States are ready to make any f0 reasonable arrangement as to the police tn of the St. Lawrence which may he sug- t|, gostcd by Great Britan. If the claim by w] Mr. Clay wasjust, when tliepopulation ol w States borderiug on tho shoros of the en lakes was only 8,400,000, it now dorlvos yC (jrcaier mrce aim lijuilj iruui ui? muuw ()| ed population, wealth, production and ton- ?? nagcof theStutcs on tho Canadian frontier. f? Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in co bebnlf of our rights, tho principle for ^ ivhich he contended has been freoncntly hn md by various nations recognized by law co ar by treaty, and has been extended to ?<. several of the great rivers. By the treaty {jj included at Mayence in "1831, the (]c [iliine was declared free from the point ^ where it is fltst navigable into tho sea. By Jy, ihe convention between 8pain and Por- wj :ugal, concluded in 18515, the navlgaLion of the Douro. throughout its whole ex;ent was mado free for tho subjects of jotli crowns. In 1838, the Argentine 8|( Sonlciicrotion by treaty threw open the 8U rree navigation of the Parana and Ura- ri!| *uay to the merchant vessels of all nil- ^ lions. In 1850 the Crimean wsr was t0 :loscd by a treaty which provided for the su free navigation ol the riverDanube. In 18oS C() Bolivia by a treaty declared Hint it re- rc| jarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, mi in accordance with fixed principles of an national law, as highways or channels |,c jpened by nature for the commerce of all m, nations. In 1850 tho Paraguay was made 0f free by a treaty, and in December, 1880, ^ the Euiperor of Brazil by an imperial do- cn ;rcc declared tho Amazon to be open to Ihe frontier of Brazil to the merchant (? iliips of nil nations. The greatest living Jc British authority on this subject, while j,, inserting the abstract right of the British sc claim, says that It seems difficult to deny (|l. that Great Britain may ground liar refusal jn upon strict law, but it is equally difficult to (lf Jeny, first, that in so doing sho cxerclncs. ro Unrahly an extreme and liard law; sec- q( jndly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of tho St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsistency n|] with ner conduct with respect to tho navigation of the Mississippi. On tho l ground that she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise, sho Insisted on tho right to navipite the entire volume of its waters. On the ground that sho possessed both banks Vl of tho St. Lawrence where It disembogues "c into tho sea, sho denies to the United J States the right of navigation though 1)1 about one half o! the waters of Lakes "J Ontario, Erlo, Huron and Superior, and D the whole of Lako Michigan, throueh " which the river flows are, the property of the United States. The whole nation is it ntorested In securing cheap transporta- e> on from the agricultural States of the i'csI by thin river to Uie Atlantic sonjard. To the citizens of those States 11 icures a greater return for their labor i the Inhabitant! ot the seaboard it afford! leapur food; to the nation an increase i the annual surplus ol wealth. It it oped that the Government of Greal rttaln will sec the justice of abandoning ic narrow and inconsistent claim, t< hich her Canadian provinces have urged or adherence. Our depressed commerce is n subjec! i which I called your special attention t the last session, and suggested that w< ould in the future have to look more tc le countries south of us, and to Chins ad Japan for its revival. Otir rcpresenitives to nil these Governments have ex rtcd their inBuence to encourage trade etwecn the United States and the luntries to.whlch they are accredited; ut the (act exists that the carrying k one almost entirely In foreign bottoms id while this stale of alfairs exists we innot control our due share of the comlercc of the world. That between the aciflc States and China and Japan is rout all the carrying trade now eonacted in American vessels. I would rc>intncnd a liberal pulicy towards that no of American steamers?one that will sure its succcss and even increased uscilness. Tho cost of building iron vea:1s?the only ones that can compete with reign ships iu the carrying trade'?is so iucIi greater in the United States than in ireign countries that without Borne asstance from the Government tliey cannot i successfully built here. There will bo iverul propositions laid befbru Congress i the course of the present session lookg to a remedy for this evil. Even ifit lould be at somo cost to tho national casury, I hope such encouragement ill be given as will secure American lipping on tho high seas and American lip-budding at home. The condidon of the archives at the cpartinent of 8tale calls for tho early ition of Congress. Tho building :iw rented by that department a frail structure, at an inconvenient disnce from tho Executive mansion, and om the other departments. It is ill laptcd to the purpose for which it is >ea, has not tho capacity to accommoite tho archives, ami is not fire-proof. Its imoto situation, its slender construction, id tho abseneu o! a supply of water in 10 neighborhood leave but little hope ol .tety lor either tho building or its counts in ease ol the accident of a fire. Its atruction would involvo thu loss of the ills containing the original acts and rusolions of Congress, of the historic records "tho Itcvolution,and of the Confederation, 'the whole series of diplomatic and consur archives siuce the adoption of tho onitution, and of thu many other tluablo records una papers loit wtui lat department when it was tlio principal 'poaltoryofthe Governmental archives, recommend an appropriation lor 0 construction of. a building (or the Detriment of State. 1 recommend to your reconsidcram the propriety of transferrin); to the epartinent of the Interior, to which ey seem more appropriately to bong, nil powers and duties in retion to the territories with which ic Department uf State in now larged by law or usages; and from the i tenor Department to the War Departent the Pension Bureau, so Inr as it regates the payment of soldiers' iwnsions. would farther recommend that the payent of naval pensions be transferred to io of the Bureaus of tho Navy Dop'artent Tho estimates for the expenses of e Government for tho next fiscal year are 18,244,840.01 less than for the current ie, but exceed the appropriation lor the esent year, for the same items, $8,072,127.I. In this estimate, however, is inclttdI $22,338,378 87 for public works herefore begun under Congressional provisn. and of which only so much is asked Congress may choose to give. Tho ipropriation lor the same works lor thu esent fiscal year was $11,984,51808. The average value of gold us compared ith NutionaTcurrency, lor the whole of c year 1809, was about 1.34, and r eleven months of 1870 the sumo lutive value has been about 1.15. The iproach to a specie basis is very gratifyg, but tho fact cannot be denied that the stability of the value of our currency is cjudiciui to our prosperity and tends to icp up prices to tlio detriment ol trade, lie evils ol a depreciated and fluctuating irrency are so great that, now when the cmium on gold has fallen so much, it i>uld seem that the time has arrived hen, by wise anil prudent legislation, ingress should look to u (tolicy which oulil place our currency ut par with gold no distant day. The lax collected from the people has en reduced more than eighty million illars |ier annum. By steadiness in ir present course there is no reason why a few short years, the national tax ithcrcr may not disappear Iron) the door tlio citizen almost entirely. Willi the venue stamp dispensed uy the postasters in every community, a tax upon I liquors of all sorts and tobacco in all its rms, and by a wise adjustment of tho riir, which will nut a duty only upon ose articles which we could dispense ilb, known as luxuries, and thoso which a nse more of lhan we produce, revenue ough may be raised after a few are of ]xaicc and consequent reduction indebtedness to fulfill all our oblitions. A further reduction ol expenses addition to a reduction of the interest ncmit may be relied on to make this practible. lievenuo reform, if it means this, s iny hearty support; it it implies a flection of ail the revenue for the sup Tl Ol uuvi-rimiviii, iur luu jmj hii-iil tho principal and interest of the public bt, pensions, &c., by directly taxing the ople, then I am against revenue reform, d conttdcntly believe the people arc itb me. If It means failure to provide b necessary moans to defray all the oxnses of the Government, and thereby a puliation of the public debt and |>enins, then I am still more opposed to cli kind ot revenue relorm. Revenue form has not been defined by any ot its vocates, to my knowledge, but seems be accepted as something which is to pnly every man's wants without any st or ellorl on his part. A true revenue form cannot be mudo In a day, but 1st bo the work of national legislation d of time, As soon as tho revenue can dispensed with all duty should bo re3ved from coffee, tea and other articles universal uso, not produced by ourIves. The necessities of the country mpcl us to colloct revenue Irom our irarts. Our army of assessors and colaors Is not n pleasant sight to the cltin, but that or a tariff lor revenue necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it ts in the encouragement to home proiction,affords employment to labor at liv; wagi*, in contrast to the pauper labor the old world, and also in Uiu developtnt of homo resources. Under tho act of ingress ol the 15th day of July, 1870, e army has gradually been reduced, so at on the 1st Hay of January, 1871, the imber of commissioned officers and men II not exceed the number contemplated 1 that law. The War Department building is an old ucture, not tire proof, and entirely inequate in dimensions to our present inls. Many thousands of dollars are iw raid annually for rent of private lildings to accommodate the various ireaus of the Department. I recnmend an appropriation for a new War epartment building sailed to the present id growing wanu of the nation. The report of the Secretary of War ows a very satisfactory redaction in the [penses of the army for the last 6scal ' year. For details you are referred to hit accompanying report. The expenses of the navyfor the whole ; of the laat year, that in, from December, i 1869, the date of the last report, are leu I than $19,000,1X10, or about $1,000,000 i leu than they were the previous year. Tbe expenses since the commencement of I this fiscal year, ??. since July lit, show for 1 the five months a decrease of over $2,400, ' 000 from those of the corresponding months of last year. The estimates for the current year were $28,205,671 37; 1 those for next year are $20,688,817, with ! $966,100 additional for temporary and 1 permanent improvements. These esti1 mates are msde'cloiely for the mere maintenance of the naval establishment as it is, without much in the nature of perou' ment improvements. The appropriations 1 were made for tbe last and current years, ! and were evidently intended by Congress, 1 and are sufficient only, to keep the navy ! on its present footing, and the repairing and refitting of our old ships. This I policy must, of course, gradually but surely destroy the navy, and it is in itself far from economical, as each year that it is pursued the necessity for more repairs in ships and navy yards, &c.f becomes more imperative and more costly, and our current expenses are actually increased for the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon become unsafe and useless. I hope during the present session of Congress to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval veuels can be built and repairs made with great saving upon the present cost. It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a government which represents a country with over five thousand miles of ooast li ne on both oceans exclusive of Alaska, and containing forty millions of progressive people, with relations of every nature with almost every for eign country, to restsatlsficd with snch inadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy either of protection or redress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the Eastern continent, our navy is our only means of direct protection to our citizeni abroad, or for the enforcement of any foreign policy. The accompanying report of the Postmaster General shows a moBt satisfactory working of that Department. With the adoption of the recommendations contained therein, particularly those relating to a reform in the franking privilege and the adoption of correspondence cards, a seUsustaioiog postal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a further reduction of the rate of postage be attained. I recommend the authorization by Congress to the Postmaster General and Attorney General to iuue all comI missions to officials appointed through their respective Departments. At present these com missions, wbereappointments arc Presidential,are issued by the StateDepartmenu The law in all the departments of the government, exceptthose of the Post* office and Justice, authorizes each to issue its own commissions. Always favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing, which I would like to see remedied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would have it eo beyond the mere fixing of the tenure of office of clerks and employes who do not require the advice and consent of the Senate to make their appointments complete. I would have it govern, not the tenure, bat the manner of making all appoint* ments. There is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and beads of departments as that of appointments; nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men for public place. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the Government will be bailed with approval by the whole people of the united States. Reform in the management of Indian affairs has received the special attention of the administration from its inauguration to the present day. The experiment of making it n missionary work was tried , with a few agencies given to the denomination of Friends., and has been found to work advantageously. All agencies and superintendences not so disposed of were given to officers of the army. The act of Congress reducing the army renders army officers ineligible for civil positions, Indian agencies being civil offices, I determined to give all the agencies to such religious denominations i as had heretofore established misssions among the Indians, and perhaps to some other denominations who would undertake the work on the same terms, t. e., as a missionary work. The societies selected nre allowed to make their own agents, subject to the approval of the Executive, and aro cxpected to watch over und aid them as missionaries and christians, and civilize the Indian and train him in the arts of peace. The Government watches over the official acts of these agents and requires of them as strict an accountability as if they were appointed in any other manner. I enter- I tain the confluent hope that the policy now pursued will-in a lew years bring all i the Indians unon reservations, where they i will live iu nouses, have school houses 11 iiml churches and will uc pursuing peace- i I'ul and self-sustaining vocations, and where they may be visited by tho lawabiding white man with the same impu- i nity tbaf he now visits the civilized white , settlements. I call your special attention i to the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs Tor full information on this i subject. I During the last fiscal year 8,005,418 1 acres of public land wero disposed of. Of 1 this quantity ii,098,010.05 acres wero 1 taken under the homestead law, and 1 2,159,515.81 acres sold for cash. There- 1 maimler was located with military war- J rants, college or Indian scrip, or applied 1 in satisfaction ol grants to railways, or I other public uses. Tho entries under the homestead law during tho post year covered tl(ll,54.i acres moro than those dur- ' ing the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the lull extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity ol land In the market will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the settler under the homestead or preemption laws is not,however, limited to lands subject to sale or private entry. Any unappropriated sun-eyed public land may, to a limited amount, bo acquired under the former laws if the party entitled to enter under them will comply with the requirements they prescribe in regard to the residence and cultivation. The actual set- i tier's preference right of purchase is even broader, and extends to lands which wero nnsurvcycd nt the time of bis settlement. His right was formerly confined within much narrower limits, and at one period ol our history was conferred only by special statutes. Thoy were enacted from time to timo to legalize what was then re- I garded as an unauthorized Intrusion upon the national domain. The opinion that the public lands should be regarded chiefly as a source of revenue is no longer maintained. The rapid settlomentand successful cultivation or them isnowjuitly considered of more importance to our well being than is the fund which the sale of them would produce. The remarkable growth and prosperity of our new States and territories attest the wisdom of the legislation which invites the tiller of the soli to securo a permanent homo on terms within I tho reach of all The pioneer who incurs tho dangers and privations of a frontier ll!c,and thus aids in laying the foundation of new commonwealths,renders a signal service to lils country, and is entitled to Its special favor and protection. Theso laws securo that object and largely promote the general welfare. Tlicy sliould, therefore, lit cherished as t permanent feature of our laud system Oood faith requires lis to give full effect ti the existing grants. The time honored and beneficent policy of setting upari certain sections or public lands for educatlonal purposes in the new State should be continued. WJicn ample provision shall have been made for these objects. I .mil* mlt as a question worthy of serious con sideration, whether the rcsiduo of oui national domain should not be wholly dl* posed of under the provisions ol the homestead and preemption law& In addition to the swamp and overflowed lands grunted to the States, in which there are siluated the lands taken under the agricultural college acts and for Internal improvement purposes, under the ncl of September 1841, and the acts supple, mcntary thereto, there had been conveyed up to the closo of the last fiscal year bj patent or other equivalent cviuencc ol title, to States and corporations 27, 8l)f)^97.6S acres for railways, canals and wagon roads. It is estimated thai an ad ditlonal quantity of 174,735,023 acres Is si III due tinder grants for llko uses. Tlx policy of thus aiding the States in build Ingworks of internal improvement wasln augn rated more than forty yean since it thegrantsto Indiana anu Illinois to ale those States in opening canals to connec tho waters of the Wabash with those o Lake Erie, and tho waters of tho Iilinoii with th(?c of Lake Michigan. It was follow ed with some modification in the grant tc Illinois of alternate sections of "public lands wfthln certain limits of the Illinois Central Railway. Fourteen States aqd sundry corporations have received similar subsidies in connection with ' 'railways completed, or in process ol construction. ' As tho reserved sections are rated at the double minimum, the sale of them at the enhanced price has thus in many Instances indemnified the Treasury for the granted laud Tho construction of sorno of these (hop Oughfares has undoubtedly given a vigorous impulse to the development of oui resources and the settlement of tho more distant portions of the country. It may, however? be well inslstod that much of our legislation in this regard has-been characterized by Indiscriminate and profuse liberality. The United Btatesshould not loan their credit in aid ol any enterprise undertaken by States or corporation! unless the projected works are of acknowledged national importance. I am strongly inclined to thoopinion that it is inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description, but should Congress determine otherwise, I earnestly rccommend that tho rights of settlers and of the public bo more effectually secured and protected by appropriate legislation. During the year ending September 20, 1870, there were filed in too Patent office 10,411 applications for patents, 3,374 caveats, and 100 applications for tho extension of patents.- 13,822 patents* :Jncluilinir reissues and dcslims. were issued, 110 extended, and 1,080 allowed but nol issued by reasAn of the non-pnybient ol the final fees. The receipts ot the offlcc during the fiscal year were |1!!0,804.29 in excess of its expenditures. Tho work ot the Census Bureau lias been energetically prosecuted. TUo preliminary report, containing much information ol spccial value and interest will be ready for delivery during tho present session. The romaimng volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent with perfect accuracy in arranging and classifying the returns. Wo shall thus, at no distant day, be furnished with an authentic record of our condition and resources. It will, I doubt not, attest tho growing prosperity of the country, although during the decado which bos just closed it was so severely tried by tho great war waged to maintain Jts integrity and to secure and perpetuate our free institutions. During tho lost fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners,including the cost of disbursements, was |27,780,811 11, and 1,758 bounty laud warrants were issued. At its close 108,689 names were on tho pension rolls. The labors of the Pension Office have been directed to the severe scrutiny of the evidence submitted in favor of new claims, and to the discovery of fictitious claims which have been heretofore allowed. The appropriation lor the employment ol special agents for the investigation ot frauds has been Judiciously used and the results obtained have been of unquestionable benefit to the service. Tliesubjectol education and agriculture are of great interest to the succcss ol our republican institutions, happiness and grandeur as a nation. In the interest ol one, a bureau has been established In the Interior Department, the Bureau ol Education, and in the interests of the other, a separate department, that of Agriculture. I believe great general good Is to lollow from the operations or both these bureaus ifprnporly fostered. I cannot commend to your careful consideration too highly the icports of tho Commissioners of Education and of Agriculture, nor urge too strongly such liberal legislation as to secure thcirefflclency. In conclusion, I would sum up the policy the administration to be a thorough enforcement of every law; a faitblul collecDf every tax provided for; economy In the disbursement of the same; a prompt payment of every debt of tho nation; a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit, reduction of taxation and tnrlft to be so arranged ns to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number; honest and fair dealmis with all other noonle. to the end that war, with all its blighting consequences, may bo avoided, but without surrendering any right or obligation duo to us; a relortn in tho treatment of the Indians, and in the whole civil service ol the country; and Anally, in securing a pure, untrammelled ballot where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so Just anco at each election without lear of molestation or proscription nn account or his iiolltical faith, nativity or color.
