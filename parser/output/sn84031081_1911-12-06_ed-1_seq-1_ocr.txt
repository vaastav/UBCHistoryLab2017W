Deserving of No Mer rv From Court, lly Morning Journal Siwlul lawJ Wtrs.l Los Angeles, Dec. 5. Two brothers -Jas. Iiarnabns McNamara and John J. McNamara, natives of Cincinnati, ( ihin the one slip, drop-shouldered uml sallow-faced, with small eyes and the other u broad, robust man of rud dy countenance, felt today the strong hand of Justice which they long had thought to evade, the former belli sentenced to life Imprisonment and the, latter to fifteen years In the stale penitentiary. It was the retaliatory action of the law against those lawless methods which John J. McNamara, secretary treasurer of the International Associ ation of Hrlde and Structural Iron Workers, thought it necessary to pur sue in coping wllh what he regarded as the all-powerful opposition of cap ital. Though the younger brother, James fi., informally presenting his confes sion to tho court today, declared he Intended no murder when he placed sixteen bUcks of dynamite beneath tho Los Angeles Times building on Oc tober 1, lUi, twenty-one persons be lr, k:1U 'y trc- le.-ilflc t-xp-osbm, John J. MeNumara, recounting tonight to his attorneys his principles, broke down as he muttered that he fought against great odds in the best way he could. It was a sequel to the court room scene earlier today when he re ceived his sentence in tears of abject surrender. For the crime of the Times build ing explosion, James 1!., wis punish ed'; for directing the destruction by dynamite of the Llewellyn Iron Works, wherein no lives were lost, John J., was sentenced, yet hardly a few hours had passed when the word went forth that subpoenas would be issued for both men to appear before the federal grand Jury to divulge fur ther details of their dynamiting con fpiraeics. The I'nited states government now will demand of them Information con cerning Interstate tra'ticking In dyna mite which is alleged to have result ed in more than a hundred explosions at bridges and factories where labor warfare was involved. 15.000 furious People Disappointed. Momntlilnir of the same fear of ter rorism brought by those explosions flitted through a crowd ol neauj u, iiiiii nersons todav. as It surged back and forth around Die Jail expecong to tee the McNamuras taken out nno the open air on their way to the hail of records, w here previously scenes In the trial had been enacted. But the court and counsel, taking cognizance ,,f i.nciuihlu lawlessness, held, the final session In a court room adjoining the Jail and the prisoners were taken thither over an Interior bridge pass ageway, "1 never carried a gun before, since the McNamara affair started," confid ed Samuel L. Hrown, chief of the state department of investigation, and his detectives reported to him that suspic ious characters by the scores were scattered In the crowd. Judge llordwell changed his mind wveral times, but took final precau tion and held court In the small chamber beside the jail. Outside the crowd begged for en trance. An aruiC of policemen fought its efforts. To it he Hall ol Keeords, not fur distant, the mass of human ity noved back and forth in confus ed wonder and eagerness and even many who really were entitled to ad mission were denied that privilege because of the mix-up over the place for the final sitting. In the Hall of Keeords. eight floor stairways were choked with the curi ous. Only a hundred persons saw the two brothers tied through the narrow passageway Into the chamber beside the jail. A supreme ordeal faced James B. McNamara, who worried as to wheth er or not the court would Inflict the extreme penalty, and John J. Mc Namara less liable to such severity, was anxious for his brother's sake. The twenty-four minutes of proced ure that decided the futo of the two men went forward slowly. It was quiet aimost to the point ot monotony, ami seemed prearranged, as the sentences of the prisoners had come after an nhrupt closing of the trial, pleas of guilty being entered with the assur ance of District Attorney Fredericks that he would urge clemency. Hut the fortitude of the two men, mustered for the occasion, received a net book and dismay threatened them for n moment as Judge Rordwell, In Passing sentence on Junes B. Mc Namara, seemed Inclined to inflict the death penulty and though, it did PRISON i tit x l i 1 1 v tt - r i . r i 'rr r i : mi not come, the severity of Judge Hordwell's remarks cut deep and John J. McNamura's accustomed ex pression, half smile and half sneer, as he fought his battles, passed Into one of sad dejection. s "I never raw a man change so much within a few minutes," after ward declared Judge llordwell. At torneys close, by saw tears In the eyes of John J. McNamara. It was the older brother who received the lesser sentence, who quivered. The yminger man, the confessed dynamiter, took hits sentence calmly, almost without i r iiipreh 'i, an: cf what lay before him. As he resumed his seat, he caught the eye of a newspaper man a few feet from him and smiled in rr cognition a peculiar smile from a face of sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes. Judge Bordwell talked nervously, slowly and with supreme gravity. Un used to criminal trials, he pronounc ed his first sentence of Importance outside of the civil cases which he has been handling for a score ol years. Affected himself by the drama of the moment, which determined the destinies of two nun who together confessed having caused great de struction of life and property, the judge peered steadily at the prison ers as he pronounced his judgment. JikIkc Incliiicl to Deulli Sentence. James H. McNamara arose first. He wore dark clothing and a white tie, to which his face added a sombri contrast. District Attorney Fredericks made u brief statement of the case, reading the prisoner's confession for the lirst time. As he spoke the court room was still. James H. McNamara stared hard toward the windows op posite him. "There are two sentences," said Fredericks with deliberation, "which the court may pronounce, possibly of equal severity. One Is death and the other is life imprisonment. However, In the minds of a great many per sons and possibly In the mind ot the defendant, 1 do not know, but I as sume the sentence of Imprisonment for life would be considered in some degree a less punishment than tne punishment of death. I here has been no dickering or bargaining In thin matter. Counsel on the other side are well aware of the usual cus toms of granting some degree or consideration to a defendant who has pleaded guilty not on the ground of mercy, but on the ground ot ser vice to the state. "This defendant has pleaded guilty. fly so doing he has settled that which for all time in the minds of a great many would have been a doubtful question. He has served the stale in other ways, and it is my juugnieni that some small degree of considera tion should be extended to him be cause of this Tact." To that point the prisoner was calm and unmoved, but suddenly the judge startled him. "The court," began Judge llord well, turning to the prisoner an In quiring look, "desires to ask you one question and one only, Mr. McNa mara. You have stated In the writing which the district attorney has re.id thut you placed sixteen sticks of dy namite, known nr. SO per cent pure, In the Times building, and caused It to be exploded. The question I ask you Is this: Did you seek to Pur chase for that same purpose dynamite of a higher degree of percentage '.'" The defendant paused and seemed to lose his composure. Finally he spoke: "No, your honor; no, sir." "You did not?" "No, sir." "There Is very Utile or no ray of comfort. Mr. McNamara," continual Judge llordwell, "in the assertion by you that you did not Intend to destroy life. The widows and orphans and the bereuved parents will look upon that statement at this time as a mock ery. The circumstances are against I,, mnkimr any such claim. A man who would put sixteen stick, of We Cheating the Gallows. SO per cent dynamite in a building full of explosives I do not now refer to the explosives of which you may have had no knowledge, ! really mean combustible material-! .say that a man. Who under these circumstances would place a dyntirnlte charge of that quality in such a building. In which you, as a printer, knew gas was burn ing in many places, and in which you knew there were scores of human be ings lolling, must have had no re gard whatever for the lives of his fellow beings. He must have been a murderer at heart. '"Ton Well merit the maximum pun ishment 'proscribed by law" The prisoner quivered and his head I dropped. He twisted his lingers in his hands behind him and then lifted his head again. "That the judgment of the court does not condemn you to death upon the gallows Is due to the existence of no extenuating circumstances whatever, hut because It appears to the court the part of wisdom to do otherwise... "It is the judgment of the court that as the punishment for the crime i of murder in the lirst degree to which you have pleaded guilty, you rhall be confined In the state prison of this statB at Han Quentin for and during your natural life. You may be seated." As relieved as any one could be with a life sentence confronting him the prisoner sat down beside his brother. The big brother arose and the lit tle brother received him affectionate ly. John J. McNamara Deeply .Moved. After the court had read the In dictments charging him with having caused the destruction oT the Llew ellyn Iron Works in this city, the dis trict attorney begun a brief address and John J, whispered to James Fi., that he could Bit down while the dis trict attorney was talking. The man about to be sentenced was plainly moved by what the court had paid to his younger brother. From across the room a ray of sunlight streaked and sparkled against thu tears in his eyes. "There were no lives lost in this case," remarked District Attorney Fredericks," and while the di : tnn tlon of property was considerable, i: vaa not great." He cited the custom of leniency where a defendant pleaded guilty and continued: "The extreme penalty which the law could Inflict for this offense would be life Imprisonment, and all I would suggest In that connection would be that the court take Into considera tion the probable lire remaining to the prisoner and leave to him a few hours of freedom at its end; not as a mat ter of mercy, not as a matter of con sideration, not as a matter that he has earned It or is entitled to It, but because I believe it is a wise policy of the state, when a man surrenders himself, plves up and pleads guilty, and because of other services ren dered to the state, that some small consideration not much, but some be extended." The defendant arose again. "Mr. McNamara," said Judge llord well, "you have heard the court's re marks to your brother and In no small degree, sir, they undoubtedly apply to you. And. as In his case, the fact that the court may not mete out to you the extreme penalty of the law Is In no degree due to any doubt that you merit It, but simply because It appears to be the part of wisdom to do otherwise. The Judgment the court now pronounces upon your plea of guilty to this charge, Is that you be confined In the stale prison at San Quentin for the period of fifteen years. "You may be seated." "Anything further?" One 8 I'riiiter; Oilier Iron Worker. The district attorney Indicated that it was customary to nsk the occupa tion of the defendants. "Is that a matter the court should take up at this time? That is a new section, isn't It?" queried. the Judge. District Attorney Fredericks rererr ed to the statute declaring that it was designed to -supply Information for the prison officials. The brothers were again asked to arise. James H. said ho hoped his trade was printing and John J. said "struc tural Iron worker." The rroseoutlmr Jtorney reminded the com t that It Sflid lnirty af-.ys In make a report on the criminal char acter, of the prisoners for the prison officials and i the proceedings were concluded. The prisoners were led quickly back to tne Jail by Sheriff Hammil. Around the table wheue counsel had been seated the spectatorsfintn erod, some congratulating the prose cuting attorney on his work. Clarence S, Harrow, chief counsel for the defense, sat In silence throughout the proceedings. At the end hp arose and with his ssiocfnte attorneys, followed tho sheriff Into the Jail to console the prisoners. Outdoors a disappointed crowd lingered. When the crowd learned that the McNamuras jiad been sent enced while It was waiting for them to come out of the Jail on tho ex pected trip to the Hall of Keeords, there was much dissatisfaction but the officers dispersed the multitude. For n long time, however, a number of persons lingered about the jail In the ho,ie of seeing tho" McNamaras hustled away to the train for San Quentin. In his office In the Hall of .Records, District Attorney Fredericks liter discussed the case. It was pointed out to him that the age of John J. Mc Namara as given by himself on the Jail records was I!4 years and a sent ence of fifteen years, which ineanr nine years and two months of good behavior, would bring the prisoner's age only to 411 years. "Well, 1 did not tlx the number of years," said Mr. Fredericks, "but 1 suppose the court took Into nccoiint John J. McNamaras apparent age which certainly seems like 47 years. In fact, I always have had the Im pression that he was that old. After nine years in state prison lie will be on old man, "Home of the statements from union leaders repudiating the Mc Namuras are sincere and some are rot," Mr. Fredericks continued. "Home of the men who are making the 'oiidest public utterances are Im plicated in the dynamiting outrages for which these men were sentenced today. "As for John J. McNamara, I think there is nothing that he knows con cerning this case which I do not know, It is not necessary for him to make any further statement. Greatest Crisis Since Civil War. "The case Is not yet closed. I be lieve that never since the civil war has the I'nited States passed through such a crisis as was Involved In this tremendous ease. 1 believe that this trial and the ultimate results will mark the passing of the bludgeon, the walking delegate and the dynamiter from the ranks of union labor. "If this happens, as I am confident It will, labor will have cleansed Itself, and untold good will follow." Federal Attorneys Talk Over Plans. Later in the afternoon Oscar law lor, appointed today as special prose cutor for the government In Its In vestigation of alleged dynamiting con spiracles, talked at length with Dis trict Attorney Hedertcks and mem bers of his staff. Hooks and papers and details of the evidence In the Mc Namara ease were on a table before them. F.dward A. Keagan, assistant I'nited States district attorney, Joined the gathering for a short time, and when ho returned to his office It was said the subpoena for the appearance' of the McNamara brothers before the federal grand jury which has ad- (( oiitliiiiod on rage A, Coluinu 1 1.)

Socialism grappled In a final struggle with Its opponents under the "good govern ment" banner at the ballot box today and was defeated. Prohibition, the other big Issue In the municipal campaign, received scant attention from the vote count ers tonight and the tale of the dras tic "dry" ordinance remains uncertain though the probability is that it has been defeated. Forced to yield first place In the nominating ballot October 111, when the vole cast totaled 45.00(1, Mayor George Alexander polled today- ap parently more than a two to one ma jority over Job liarrlmnn, socialist, In u vote which totsled U,lrtO. When llaii linaii gained a plurality of 3.000 over the mayor In the October primaries, the registration was ap proximately 75,000. Today HiT.OuO persons, Including 75,00(1 women, were entitled to vote. Ninety per cent of the registration oil the west side, where the vote was light In the primary, was voted today, while on the east side, Hariiman's stronghold, there was a falling off In comparison'. The women of the west side out-voted the men. The reverse was in the precincts where Harrlman was the stronger In the primary. Hut the balance of pow er which the women were credited with having prior to the astounding finale of the McNamara case last Fri day did not figure In the result. "Persons who would not vote for Alexander simply stayed away from the polls." Chairman H. C. Graham of the good government organization declared tonight In predicting a ma jority of at bast 30,000 for Alexand er. Harrlman was In conference with his campaign manager, Alexander Ir vine of New York, early In the even ing. He declared that gross frauds hail been perpetrated by the opposi tion, but refused to four-ode. his de feat. The victorious ticket consists of Mayor Alexander anil nine council men, made up of bankers, lawyers, storekeepers and really brokers. On the defeated socialist ticket, be side Harrhiiiin, the lawyer, there were one negro Junk dealer, a former editor of one of the local morning papers, two Iron moulders and Sev ern t labor leaders. line feature of the balloting was the scratching, which was early ap parent, of Joseph A. Scott, candidate tor re-election to the school hoard, who also was one of the attorneys for tho McNamaras. It became apparent early Unit the trouble expected lo develop on ac count of Hie leellug engendered be cause of the McNamara case would nut occur during the balloting. The peace insurance' army of 1,0110 of ficers, detailed by Chief of police Se- biistlan and Sheriff Hammlll, had little lo do. (sily three minor cases of trouble were reported. The women were treated with the greatest gallantry. Many went to the polls propelling baby carriages and often fathers took o.iro of baby while mother voted. In one precinct a puzzled woman voted in favor of the prohibition ord inance, though she was opposed to it. When she learned wat she had done, she rushed back to I hu booth und declared; 1 want to cliange my vole." She was told that was Impossible, "Oh, but It must he changed," she exclaimed and the election officials patiently explained that it wasitguiust the law. Carolina M.
