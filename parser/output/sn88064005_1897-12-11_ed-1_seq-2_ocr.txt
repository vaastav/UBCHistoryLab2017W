PUBLISHED EVERY SATURDAY. E. I. ADDISON, .........Publisher. Saturday, December 11, 1897. Chap. A. Dopey has succeeded W. L. Grant as local editor of the Daily Iberian, and is doing creditable work. A. W. Newlin, editor of the Lake Charles Daily and Weekly Press has resigned to accept a position on a New Orleans paper. Newlin slung a graceful Faber and was a brilliant paragraphist. Congress convened in regular see sion Monday. President McKinley's message is a spiritless, colorless doco ment. He favors annexing Hawaii, has hopes of bi -metallism and the devil himself don't know what 'he thinks of Cuba if he has only the message to go-by. President Gould, of the Missouri Pacific railroad, ordered an advance of ten per cent upon the salaries of all his employee as a Thanksgiving present, to date back to November 1. This affects 15,000 employee, and will result in an additional expendi ture of $900,000 a year. blew Orleans has had two very large fires this week. One Monday night destroyed the famous Olympic club building where Corbett knocked out Sullivan. Another fire Tuesday night on Tchoupitoulas street in the business district destroyed a cork factory and about $,0,000 worth of property. Atkins, Wakeman & Co., a big commercial firm in Arcadia, this State, has the following advertise. ment in the Advance, in big type : "We hear some parties refused to take a paper because we advertised in it, and used strong language. When such parties get to hell, they will wish that they had learned some thing about the place. . . .I Henry M. Mayo, a talented young man who edited the Morgan City Review a few years ago and then accepted a position as reporter on the Times-Democrat has just beeti appointed to the responsible position of advertising agent for the Southern Pacific Railroad. This is an instance of merit bringing its own reward and all of his friends are proud of his success. The New York Sun which is now the great organ of the Republican party dissents entirely from Secre tary Gage's proposition to retire all the government paper money and substitute bank notes, guaranteed by the government, for its own paper. The Sun is now and was when it sailed under the Democratic flag, a gold standard paper, utterly opposed to silver coinage. It says that such , policy would be costly for the rea son that bonds would have to be is sued to retire the goveroment paper, thus increasing the interest bearing debt, and that the government would have a similar amount, possibly a larger one, of bank notes, which under its guarantee it would be bound to redeem in gold. Secretary Gage finds no comfort in the papers, of his own party. It is only the gold-Cleveland magwomps whose policy Mr. Gage adopted, that sup. port him in his wild attack upon the money of the people. A Repablican Love Feast. Last week the regular Republican State Central Committee held at meeting in New Orleans. It was the gathering of the reincarrnated r spirtis of the harpies of a departed I and depraved age. It was the old E rank, radical Republican party, with i wool and musk predominant and all i permeating. Demas, the ebony statesmi n from St. John was grand r ringmaster, he held the whip handle and right royally did he rule. There I were Dave Young, C. F. Brown, I T'elesmar Paddio. Doug. Burrell,i Tom Clayton, H. H. Blount, Des dunes, John Minor, Wash Lyons,14 Wash Smith, Rich. Sims and many other distinguished sons of Ham, to say nothing of the white men who while deeply deploring the fact that they had not been born of nigger mothers found consolation in the be lief that if a white man behaves himn self he is almost the equal of a nig ger. Demas having convinced the brethren that he had a leadpipe cinch on McKinley and the federal patronage, knew that he had a full hand and proceeded to clean up the board. True to his aboriginal in stincts he demanded the heads of the Reed men as a sacrifice upon the altar of Hannaism. Poor Billy Pitt Kellegg was gathered up figurative ly by the scuff of the neck and the slack of his pantaloons and fired bodily into outer darkness. Only Dave Young said a short, sad prayer for the repose of the disjointed statesman's political soul. There will be w:eeping and wail ing and gnashing of teeth among the select little coterie of self annointed preservers of the faith, but it avail eth naught. The cant handful of white men who, represent nothing on God's green earth save an undying lust for public pap, have sought to put the negro in the rear that they might mount into office upon his back have been properly rebuked. The negro is the bone and sinew of jthe Republican party in this State. He is the whole thing and he has awakened to that fact. The Repub. lican party in this State has been, is now and always will be a negro party until the great mass of negroes are boldly eliminated from the suf frage. The scant and hypocrisy of these people will not fructify. The negro is not going to play catspaw sapny longer. Get rid of the ignorant corrupt negro and the white people of the State will divide and then may the best man win. a The eagle eye of Chevis of the Baton Rouge Advocate has evident ly slept just a bit of late or he would not have failed to note the entrance of his old friend Curley Duson into the fold of the black and tan, "trooly loil" State Central Committee. Dosort was always regarded as be longing to the high toned sugar teat wing, but as he is'a shrewd politi cian he soon perceived that these people did not cut much ice with the administration and he forthwith pro ceeded to get in on the ground floor with the gang who have a pull on McKinley's leg which is a dead sure thing for some pap. Two important press meetings oc cur at New Orleans this month, that ot the Louisiana Press association the 14 and 15th, to be followed by the third annual session of the West ern Editorial Federation the 16th, 17th and 18th. The deliberations of these bodies at this time will prove of more than ordinary interest owing to important State measures now before the people, and every newspaper man in the State should make an effort to be present at these meetings. Gives Up the Gbost. In deference to public clamor, the lucid denunciations of the daily press ! and an organized assault by the com I mercial exchanges of New Orleans, I the State Board of Health has yield I ed up its little spirit and is now functus officio. To. a man at a dis I tance it would appear that the board dies for having done its duty. For I all the jackassism of the prevailing quarantine system the members are no more responsible than they are for the Dingley tariff abortion or the law of gravitation; they endeavored to follow the law. It is true the zeal of some of their embryo experts may have lead to pronouncing everything yellow fever from colic to meningit is, but they did report the fever. And dearly beloved, it is right here where the shoe pinches. This is the la mentable fact that is worrying Han nah. The Daily Item which is the mouth piece of the "commercial "interests" ot New Orleans, has from the very C outset denied that there was yellow e fever in New Orleans. The estima I ble gentlemen composing-the com I mercial exchanges are high authority e upon all questions of modern medi - cine and scientifiQ sanitation. Their a daily intercourse with shirtings and a sheeting, beans and bananas, sour t krout and pork. cabbage and coffee - have made them unusually familiar a with the modes and methods of mi I crobes and bacteria, and what little r remains in the domain of human r pathology with which they are unac I quainted is very insignificant indeed. These doings have set the country brethren to thinking and they ask themselves if the commercial inter I ests of New Orleans are not making a grand stand play for a Galveston f Health Board. There is throughout the country an ill founded but wide spread belief that there are cases of yellow fever in New Orleans every year. Get a board of health whose chief business will be to sneeze when the Board of Trade takes snuff and f every old back number doctor and crank in the country will sniffyellow a feve when the dog days approach and we will have a repetition of the beau ties of this year's absurd shot .gun quarantine. No Galveston trick+ s will do, gentlemen. Senator Caffery in a recent iter view says that a war with Spain in the near future is in his opinion, in evitable. It is his belief too, that it will be caused by the vacillatory policy of the present administrationu. The President' is trying to please everybody, but he will soon find that the jingo pressure is the strongest and finally he will be swept aside by it. If the President should attempt to throw the responsibility upon Congress there will be no question as to the result. Resolutions of bel ligerency and independence could be put through with a whoop. Outside of Congress the war feeling he thinks strong, due to discontent, and in his opinion !00,C00 men could be raised in the South in a few days. While he is not for war, Senator Caffery thinks we are drifting to it. Some well-informed men are of opinion that with the elimination of the negro vote the white people will divide on economic questions and the Republican party will be placed in power. Aes ,yuch as we would hate to see the downfall of Democracy in this State, w#say, let it be so. But for the good name of our State anid the honor of those who will come after us, let the men of to-day settle this matter, upon which rests our well, being as a people, in a manner that Will reflect everlasting credit upon themselves and insure peace and prosperity to their des cendants. Men of Lafayette, the issue is clear; white rule vs. negro rule; intelligence vs. ignorance; honesty vs. corruption. Under which flag will you fight ? --Lafayette Gaette. Eli Wise & Q

J. N. Defrance was born Septem ber 17. 1819, in Paurro an Boix, near Sedan, France. In 1836 he came to New Orleans and found employment with Mallard a merchant of that city. Some ten years later he moved to Abbeville where in 1850 married P Caroline Boudreaux, the widow of r Clervil!e Blanchet. Of this union were horn four daughters, Lanre, Mrs. Jos. M. Fraser, Letitia, Mrs. Edgar Dutel, Cora, Mrs. W.R. f Eilis and Aurore, Mrs. Louis La porte all of whom with the widow r survive. The deceased had many friends to whom ho was endeared by. his uni r form pleasant um'nners. He had occupied creditably a nimher of r public positions. among them justice _ of the peace and clerk of the police ijury. Next week will appear in French a detailed sketch of his life. Senator Chandler, he of the seesl', ing brain and caustic tongue has written another of his remarkable - letters on bimetallism. Chandler is a bimetallist. He believes that in ternational agreement is the only t road to it, for the reason that our adoption of 16 to I standard woald f produce monomtetalistm. He is one of the most astute politicians and Sbrainy men amongst the republican leaders, and his republicanism dates hack to 1856. In his last letter be plainly tells his party friends that the adoption of the single standard. I the failure to press the question of bimetalli-m--means party defeat in 1898 and 1900-and, as be claiiu. silver monometallism as the rae!t. He urges further action as to tbe Eu. ropean nations acnd closes his leter with a most practical proposition that being the calling of a Pan American moneta ry convention which he says will retnonetize silver which having been accomplished all Europe will surrender. Senator Chandler doesnot telt the. people that a Re publican President, Benjamin Harri son. defeated just such a proposition t in 1891. t The other day uedge Botkin stood on a street corner in Topeka and watched a gang of cow boys ride by with their broad brimmed slouch hats, when they let out a cow boy yell. Turning to Mike Sutton he said, "Rebel cavalry by- , I havei seen the time that I would rou from those fellows." "Yes," said Mile, "so have 1, rebs or cow boys either." -Kansas City Tribune.
