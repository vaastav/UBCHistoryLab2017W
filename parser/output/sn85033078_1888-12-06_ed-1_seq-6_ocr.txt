Latest estimates place the wheat crop ©f France at 273 ; 000,000 bushels, with a reserve of wheat and flour from last year’s crop equivalent to 68,000,000 bush ele. Dubing October, 40.365 immigrants came to this country, against 44,166 in October 1887. Germany furnished the greatest number, 10,166; England and Wales, 7,477; Ireland 5,530; Sweden and Norway, 4,250; Italy, 2,785, and Scotland 2,094. The proof-reader for the Charleston Courier is a young woman, who leaves for home every morning at 2 o'clock.

The total values of the expoits of mer chandise from the United States during the twelve months ended Oct. 31, 1888, as compared with similar exports daring the corresponding period of 1887, were: For 1888, $724,605,230; 1887, $678,422,- 850. The values of imports were: For 1888, $707,157,198; 1887, $722,776,939. Eloeh Smith, who heads a Mormon colony in Alabama, says that the church has 40 mission stations in Alabama and Tennessee and 10,000 converts are made by them annually. The elder is on his way to Salt Lake City with 200 converts many of them mere girls recruited as victims to polygamy. By the report of the United States treasurer, it will be seen that the surplus taxation of the people for the fiscal year of 1888 reached the great total of slll,- 341,273, while the treasury balance was increased from $69,000,000 to $129,000,- 300. This is the accumulation, somewhat reduced at present by large purchases of bends, bat growing greater every day, that threatens business and weighs upon every commercial interest and the whole people of the country, besides inviting demoralizing schemes of expenditure and loose notions of finance. The treasurer considers it useless to continue coining silver dollars, as the country is already satiated with them, and there are plenty loft in the treasury vaults to meet any demand. So he recommends that certi ficates bo issued based upon bullion deposits. A oosvtioh of cattle-men and a com mittee of the United States senators have S>een trying to discover at St. Louis why it is that in the last few years the prices for cattle have been declining, while at the same time the cost of dress ed b&ef to consumers has been increas ing. Nobody cares especially whether Bt. Louis or Chicago is the beef center of tho nation, or whether Chicago stole away from St. Louis the butchering supremacy, but it is a matter of consider able importance to know whether the con centration of the dreasrd beef business ut onivago and tho anomaly of low-priced cattle and high-priced beef is due to a ring of four or five firms, as is charged, that has been built up by means of dis " criminating railroad advantages and otner unlawful practices. It is certain that the natural laws of competition! do not rule this business, and that the peo ple have not been getting tho advantages accruing from declining prices of cattle. A little more light is called for on this enbject. 

FROM WRETCHEDNESS TO THRIFT. The rich people of Manchester, Eng land, have adopted a plan for the amelio ration of the Irish which, beyond all question, is as generous as it is practical, A year ago, a correspondent of the Man chester Guardian who was traveling in Conemaia, favv in the sea coast hamlet of Carna the lowest siege of misery and 'catitution that he bad met in the course his wanderings. He sent to his paper a letter containing a touching appeal in behalf of the wretched inhabitants of the place. This appeal did not fall on barren ground. The Manchester capitalists raised a considerable sum of money. Instead of spending it in charity they planted industries in the place. A mar ket for the goods manufactured was created in Manchester. The men, women and children found employment in these industries. The girls were taught how to knit and how to weave, and now have constant work in making caps, stockings and underwear. Boats were provided for the men who preferred to follow the oocupation of fishermen. These have established h thriving trade in potted fish and lobsters and smoked fish m the Ijiverpool market. Roads are being con structed, and numbers of men have found employment in that public improve msnt. All this was done one year ago and in that short time the aspect of the place has completely changed. Fron a dirty, squalid, unhappy place it has been changed into a happy and thrifty village. There is no trace of the past Carna to be see* in the Carna of to-day. The exhi bition of a spirit of like benevolence and fraternal feeling toward the Emerald Isle by the people of England would be the surest solution of the present complex political problem. If the economical question in Ireland were properly ad justed the political question would not long remain unsettled. If by outside help the Irish people could become skill ed in the industrial arts they would soon become prosperous. The Irish people are industrious and quick to learn. And they world not allow practical philan thropy of this kind to be misapplied. They only need the chance to improve it. Outside of Ulster county agriculture is the mainstay. It is at best, a weak mainsiay. The planting of industries by English capital would bo the surest as well as the quickest method of transform ing the social aspect of the Irish nation. There is not the money in Ireland to build an industrial system. The capital must come from other places. In the oonr'e pursued by tho benovelent people ®f Manchester may be found an example worthy of emulation.

Beblin. —The socialist electoral man ifesto predicts a struggle in the com ing election of unusual vehemence. It reminds the electors that the reichsteg will be elected, not for three years as heretofore but for five, and says that by virtue of the resolution of the St. Gall congress the socialist candidates should be nominated in every district where there are any adherents of the party, even if the chance of election be remote, in order to show the number of socialists in the empire. The socialistic manifesto further says they are hopeful that the electorate is coming to its senses, and will not again be scared by the war phantom evoked in 1887. The manifesto heralds greater activity in socialistic agitation while the reichs tag proceedings discourage police inter ference. This was seen in the marvelous toleration accorded to the socialist work men’s demonstration last evening when a large number of workmen after a meet ing formed a procession and paraded the streets singing the “Marseillaise.” The recent newspaper war has disclosed an intense Austro Hungarian jealousy of the German supremacy. Gossix. A recent subject of debate at a young ladies’ seminary in Newham, England, was: “Is Life Worth Living Without Gossip?” Th3 girls of the school, after a heated argument, decided unanimously in the negative. Mrs. Gladstone, ad dressing the Association for Promoting the Education of Girls, in Wales, upheld this decision. The Spectator defends Mrs. Gladstone on the ground that “easy conversation, sprinkled with allusions to persons, jet not confined to personalities, is one of the intellectual enjoyments possible only to those who live under and share in a developed civilization.” The national executive committee of the anti-saloon republicans met in secret session in New York city Wednesday to consider the futare policy of the organ ization. CONGRESSIONAL Monday, Deo. S. House —Long before the hoar for the meeting of the second session of the 50th ! congress the galleries of the house were . fllleC with spectators, and the bright dress es of the ladies formed a brilliant frame i to the picture presented on the floor below. There hand shaking was indulged in and j congratulations on re-election or condol ences in defeat were exchanged amont the members, jocose raillery on the part j of the republicans and patient resigna tion on the part of the democrats being | everywhere evident. The republican members who are prominently mentioned in connection with the speakership of the 51at congress, came in for an extra ; share of felicitations, it being generally ' conceded on the floor that the next house j will be republican with from 3to 7 ma- | jority. At precisely 12 o’clock the fall of i ihe gavel settled the tumult which ex istcd in the hall, and silence reigned, while Dr. Milbaru, the chaplain, offered prajer. The roll of members was then called, and the hum of conversation broke cut afresh. Daring the progress of the call Mr. Cleveland entered the executive gallery and became an attractive specta tor. The call developed the presence of 336 members, there being 88 absentees. On motion of Mr. Mills (Texas,) a reso lution was adopted directing the clerk to inform the senate that a quorum of the house had appeared, and that the house was ready to proceed to business. In accordance with the resolution the speaker appointed'Messrs. Holman (Ind.), Turner (Ga.), and O'Neill (Pa.) as a com mittee to join a similar committee to wait upon the president and inform him that congress was ready to receive any communication that he might desire to transmit. The house then, at 12:30, took a recess for an hour. After the recess Mr. Holman announced that the com mittee appointed to wait upon the presi dent had performed its duty, and that the president would communicate with con gress forthwith. The president’s annual message was then read by the clerk. The portion of the message in which the president treats of the tariff question was listened to attentively by the members on both sides of the house. Now and then a smile more of triumph than of derision would appear on the face of an enthusiastic republican, but the silence was not broken until the clerk read, “the cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly and dis tinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It is the people’s cause.” Then the could no longer re tain their feelings and broke into a round of applause, which wan answered by the derisive laughter. The president’s reference to -he Sackville- West incident provoked laughter from the republican side of the house, but no demonstration was made by the demo crats. From this point interest in the message slackened. Mr. Mills was the only member who paid the slightest at tention to its further reading, and the noise of conversation was so g-eat that this was no easy task. When, at 3:15 p. m., th reading was completed, Mr. Mills offered a resolution, which was agreed to, referring the message to the committee of the whole and providing for its print ing. Adjourned. Monday, Dec. S. Senate. —It was an unusually full sen ate that responded to President Ingalls’ call to order at 12 o’clock to-day. At that time the public galleries were crowd ed. The desk of the presiding officer was decorated by a very handsome pyra mid boquet. Exactly at 12 o’clock Sen. Ingalls called the senate to order, and Chaplain Butler opened the proceed ings with prayer. He returned thanks for the bountiful blessings vouchsaved the land in its material interests, and remembered Presi dent-elect Harrison in • his petition. A few minutes were spent in greeting senators, and then Senator Sherman of fered the usual resolutions, that the sec retary notify the house that the senate is ready to proceed to business. A resolu tion was offered by Sen. Morrill for the appointment of a committee to notify the president that the senate is ready to re ceive any communication he may have to make. Senators Morrill and Salisbury composed this committee. Sen. Cameron offered a resolution that the senate meet each day until farther ordered at 12 o’clock, which resolution was adopted. At 12:47 on motion of Mr. Sherman, the senate took a recess for half an hour. At the conclusion of the recess, which had been extended to 1:30, the usual message from the house, announcing the facts of its being in session and of its having appointed a committee to wait up on the president was delivered. That was followed by a report from the committee to wait on the president to the effest that it had performed vhaf. duty and that the president would communicate in writing immediately. The president’s message was then delivered, and Mr. McCook, sec retary of the senate, proceeded to read it. The reading of the message occupied an hour and twenty minutes. The por tions of it which discussed the question of tariff revision, treasury surplus, fishery troubles and the West incident were listened to with very close attention by the fourteen republican senators and about, an equal number of democrats. Tfce other portions of the message seemed to have but few, if any listeners, and the reading had the effect of gradually clearings the galleries of the numerous spectators. When the reading was finish ed, the message was laid on the tasle and ordered to bo printed. The presiding officer announced that the unfinished business for tomorrow was the bill to re duce taxation (the tariff bill.) Sen. Frye gave notice that he would call up for con sideration to morrow morning, the bill for settlements with the Union Pacific railroad company, and the bill was made a special order for tomorrow. The sen ate then adjourned, after notification by Sen. Frye that hs would call up the Union Pacific settlement bill to-morrow; by Sen. Chandlar, that he would ask for action oa his resolution to investigate the Louisiana election of last April, and by Sen. Allion, that he would ask the senate to proceed with the tariff bill. 

REPUBLICAN SPELL BINDERS ORGANIZE. Hon. Cbanncj M. Depew Elected President and Chief Spell Binder.

Cotopaxi. Winter tourists who think of going sonth to spend the frost-bitten months should visit the Andes and go into train ing for a walking match. A writer in the American Magazine says: Cotopaxi is the loftiest of active vol canoes, but is slumbering how. The only evidences of action are the frequent rumblings that can be heard for 100 miles, and the cloud of smoke by day and the pillar of fire by night, which constant ly arise from a crater that is more than 3.000 feet beyond the reach of man. Many have attempted to climb fhe mma ster, but the walls are so steep and the snow is so deep that the ascent is im possible, even with scaling ladders. On the southern slops of Cotopaxi is a grea‘ rock, more than 2,000 feet high, ca led the "Inca’s Head.” Tradition says that it was once the summit of the vol cano and fell on the day when was s'ranglrd by the Spaniards. Those who have seen Yesnvics can judge of the graceur of Cotopaxi if they can imagine a volcano 15,000 feet higher, spurting flames and lava from a crest covered with 3,000 feet of snow, with a voice that has been heard 000 miles. And one can judge of the grandeur of scenery on the road to Quito if he can imagine twenty of the highest mountains in America, three of them active volcanoes, standing along the road from Washington to Jiew York. Absolutely Unique. Puck. "Here me one moment madam!” said I the peddler a* the front door. I have not i been rendered incapable of active exer tion by any sort of sad accident; I have not been laid up six months with Inflam matory rheumatism; I have not lost my situation on account of my religious principles; J gm not a poor man; but am doing pretty well in my lice of business: I have not a wife and three children depen dent on me for support, for I am a content ed bachelor, happy in the possession of no living relatives; I am not studying for the ministry; your next door neighbor did not mention your name to me; I never —” “Step in,” interrupted the weary woauam, with a deep sigh of relief: “I have been waitng for you for the last 10 years. Step in—l don't care what you’re selling, whether it’s horn combs or clothes-wringers, I’ll buy, and if you’d like a cup of coffee or a glass of good hard cider, just say so. Step in—don’t bother to wipe your feet!” Real Southern Life. The moonlight drifted brokenly through a rift in the roof of a negro cab in in the Hanorer slashes and fell on Ga briel Jones’ gray-bearded face. He was smoking and meditating. “Hannah!” he called, presently; “Hannah!” Silence. “Hannah! I say, Hannah!” a trifle loud er. There was a rustling of the straw in the bed in the corner, and a sleepy an swer: “Huh?” “Hannah, did you put dat watermilion I foun’ in Marse Ben Scott’s patch, yistidy, in de cool spring?” “Yes, I put dat watermilion in de cool spring,” she answered deliberately, “Dat was right.” A moment’s pause. “Han nah, did you hang dat coat dat Mister Hedley ’sisted on my takin’ ’hind the hay rack, like I tole you?” “I did dat.” “Did you seal! and pick dem chickens I borrowed f’otn de man down on de river road the other day ?” “Yes, I scall dem chickens.” “Well, fry me one de fust t’ing in de mornin’, case I’so got t’ go over’t Mister Chinky Ciaptin’s t’-morrowt’ lead a prar meetin’ and keep dem triflin’ niggers in the right road.” Then he leaned his grizzled head on the chair back and snored the snore of the just, and the bnll-frogs in the marshes echoed it over the Chickahominy low grounds. Significance of Numbers Symbolism in numbers is an unmistak ble fact; in the world’s literature and in the customs of the world. There are symbolic values to numbers which are of well nigh universal acceptance; and al though there is always a danger of be ing misled by fanciful symbolizing in such a realm as this, it is certainly safe to recognize those symbolic values about which there can hardly be a question. Therefore three is the divine number, not only in the Bible story, but in the religions of Egypt and India. Apart from any question of the Trinity, three represents the past, the present and the future and so stands for Him who was, and is, and is to be. Four is the world number. We use it thus today, when we speak of the four quarters of the globe, the four winds of heaven, the four ele ments of nature. Three and four com bined stand for the union or the connec tion of the heavenly and the earthly; therefore seven is the sacred number. Ten is the measure of mere numerical completeness as it is understood by as when we speak of a tenfold advantage. These obvious symbolisms shov them selves again in various combinations in the Bible aarritive. With dogmatism it may be said that twelve appears to re present the multiplying oi the world number by the divine number; that is symbolizes the peculiar divine provisions of the world's needs. Thus it was that, in the line of promised blessing, there were twelve patriarchs, twelve tribes, twelve apostles, twelve foundations and gateways of the spiritual building. Thus it is that there are ample provisions to day in the plan of God for all the people of God. Even beyond the peculiar pro visions within the limits of rhe twelve, there are the wider provisions of the seventy—the sacred seven multiplied by the numerically complete ten. The Jews hold ?hat beyond the twelve tribes there were seventy nations in the world. There were seventy sacrifices offered for these nations in the great week of atonement. Seventy elders were the associates of Moses. There were seventy members in the Sanhedrim. Jesus sent out, not only his twelve apostles, but also seventy disciples, as preachers of the Gospel. Here, again, is the idea of the fullness of God’s provisions for the human race. Numbers can suggest this fullness, but numbers cannot define it. Labor in the South. Wilmington (N. C.) Messenger: From New Orleans comes an authoritative state ment that German is rapidly supplanting colored labor in the sugar plantations of Louisiana, a large number having with in the past two years been put to work, and there is urgent demand for more, which want is to be supplied. These white laborers are employed in the field as well as in the manufacture of sugar, and give great satisfaction, the estimate being made that one white man is equal to two colored in that particular crop. White foreign labor is gradually supplan ting colored labor in many localities. The colored man is not, in all places, holding up his end, and we are very sorry to see it. Too many are trying to make their livings by make shifts to avoid work. They are too ready to imitate lazy, thriftless white people who only work under compulsion. The old class of colored people, who were taught to work under the slavery regime, have proved the must thrifty of the free colored people, the most industri ous, and the best mannered. They are the class mainly which have accumulated property in their freedom, and they are the most desirable colored employes. But the class is rapidly passing away. The old-fashioned colored men and women, whom every Southern m'in and woman is bound to cherish with an affec tion peculiar to the institution of slavery, are growing rarer every day, and in their place comes a set sprung np since the war who often show no appreciation of their duties of life, and have no consideration for or sense of politeness toward the white people. We regret to have observed this. No one reared in the days of slavery, born among, inheriting, and owning them, accustomed to their association from early youth, and always tended and served by them, can ever lose his interest in the black people of the South. To such it will ever be painful to observe their retrogression. Business failures for the week number 282, against 296 last week, and 244 for the corresponding week last year.
