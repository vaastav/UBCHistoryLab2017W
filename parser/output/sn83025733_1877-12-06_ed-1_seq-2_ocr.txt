Tuk San Antonio Herald savs: ",For nando Wood introduced a bill the other day, authorizing anybody to establish gas works in the District ot Columbia.

It Is true that the recent rains have caused a slight regularity in the punc tual arrival of trains, yet not enough to warrant the irregularity of tho mails and especially the paper mails, being laid to that source. It is either the mail agent or the postmastort fault, and should be looked into at once, as it causes unnecessary and great incon venionce to the public.

Some of the great papers of the country took us severely to tank for speaking out for our remedy, Since that time two eminent and patriotic men from Texmlii the senate of the United Slates ond six in the lower house have placed before tho country a modnrato but truthful statement of the wrongs suf fered by our patient borderers, and have awakened the sympathy of tho govern ment and tho people for us. During the reign of bitter sectional ism and prejudice, which stretched be tween tho periods when tho war closed and when Hayes was Inaugurated, all the vital facts regarding the Mexican outrages on tho Kiodrundo were sidu ously kept from the knowledge of the people. Iiidilference was the rule. Even the brave and devoted army made strong representations to the executive, and they woro treated with icorn or indiUbrcuco. It was no part of tho policy of the president to rudely inter rupt tho processes by which ho was be- ing lifted from poverty to power and wealth, and bring into favorable notice the people from whoso necessities mon ey was wrung, and upon whose defeat and humiliation his own and his com peers' glory rested. A short time siuco it was announced that tho Mexicuu government had sent heavy force of troops to the Kio (Iramlo frontier in tho interest! of peace. Now wo aro told that our government has ordered strouir reinforcements to our Jtio (iramlo iron nor also in tne intercuts of peace. Men on peacoful mis sions do not take guns in their hands; but when war is meant they do. If our government means to repel force by force, it is surely strong enough to say so, and stand by the declaration. This heating about tho bush is unworthy a great nation confronting a neighbor, and benides it has no present good ellVct upon our relations with Mexico, What wo of tho Texas frontier need is immediate protection and relief. Let the government send a force there strong enough to repel any force the Mexicans can bring against it, and boldly declare its purposes, and from that moment the outrages will coaso. However, ,tho simple announcement that reinforcements are going forward, and the formal notice given the subject by tho president in his annual message, are both vast improvements over the old executive plans regarding the Rio Orande irritations, and wo beliove pre- sugo an entiro and radical chango of policy. In this view of tho case we can afford to await future developments, and with some confidence that justice will at last overtake the greaser thieves who have eked out a wretched exist ence in the Zona Libre, by thespolas tion of the citizens on this sido of tho Rio Grande. , The nation, the people, and above all, Texas, will applaud the manly attitudo taken by President Hayes.
