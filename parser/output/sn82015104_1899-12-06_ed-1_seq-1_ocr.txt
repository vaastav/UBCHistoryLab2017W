VOLUME 98.-NO. 107. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Full Text of the Document Submitted to Congress Yesterday. A Comprehensive Review of Affairs of the Government During the Past Year. The message presented to Congress yesterday by President McKinley is presented in full in the "Record-Union this morning. The message is a care fully prepared paper, treating at length upon many matters of national inter est, relating not only to home affaiis, but our relations with foreign coun tries, together with a resume of the work accomplished in the restoration of Jaw and order in Porto Rico and Cuba, the revolt in the Philippines, the settle ment of the Samoan controversy and the existing government in the Ha waiian Islands. ' Referring to the Philippines, the President reviews the cbnditions leading up to the present controversy, bestows praises upon the patriotic set vie s of thj army and navy and the work accomplished by the commission sent to the isl ands. In referring the matter to Congress for action, the President points out that * withdrawal of the American forces would result in a reign of an archy and a conflict between foreign Powers to gain territory in the archipel ago. Vast changes have been brought about in Porto Rico since the advent of American rule. The people are prosperous and pleased at the change in the government of the island. » While reconstruction in Cuba has been necessarily slow, much progress has been, made in educating the Cubans in all matters relating to self-govern ment. Congress is urged to take up the question of the future government of the island at once, that the provisions of the resolution assuring the people a free and independent government may be carried out at the earliest possible moment. The attention of Congress is called to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in the Hawaiian Islands, and necessary legislation urged extending United States laws to the islands. Many other subjects of national importance are dwelt upon, notable among them the improved condition of the postal service; work accomplished by the Department of Agriculture in furthering the interests of the farming industry; recommending the strengthening of the navy by the construction of more warships; the fostering of our merchant marine; the necessity of a cable to Manila; value of the system of Consular reports to American industries; pointing out needed legislation relating to national banks; the work accom plished by the Isthmian Canal Commission; the growing prosperity of the country under the new tariff Act; the progress made in the adjustment of controversies with the Dominion of Canada; the satisfactory settlement of the railroad bond indebtedness, and sugge sting an amendment to the Revised Statutes in relation to mob violence, giving Federal courts jurisdiction to try cases where the treaty rights of aliens are involved. THE 

MESSAGE. Subjects lreated Upon in the President's State Paper. "To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: At the threshold of your deliberations you are called to mourn with your countrymen the death of Vice President Hobatt, who passed from this life on the morning of No vember 21st last. His great soul now tests in eternal peace. His private life was pure and elevated, while his public career was ever distinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity and exalted motives. He has been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified, but his lofty character, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose and noble virtues remain with us as a priceless legacy and example. 

FOREIGN COMMERCE. Has Shown Great Increase in Vol ume and Value. The Fifty-sixth Congress convenes in its first regular session with the coun try in a condition of unusual prosperity, of universal good will among the peo ple at home, and its relations of peace and friendship with every Government of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great increase in volume and value. The combined imports and exports for the year are the largest ever shown by a single year in all our history. Our exports for 1899 alone exceeded by more than a billion dollars our imports and exports combined in 1870. The im ports per capita are 20 per cent, less than in 1870. while the exports per capita are 58 per cent, more than in 1679, showing the enlarged capacity of the' United States to satisfy the wants of its own increasing population., as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations. Exports of agricultural products were $784,770,142. Of manufactured pro ducts we exported in value $339,592, --140. being larger than any previous year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products of our manufactories sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1896 and 1899. GOVERNMENT FINANCES. Receipts and Expenditures the Past Fiscal Year. Government receipts from all sources for. the fiscal year ended June 30, 1809, < including $11,798,314.14, part payment of the Central Pacific indebtedness, aggregated $610,982,004.35. Customs receipts were $298,128.481.75. and those from internal revenue $278,457,161.51. For the fiscal year the expenditures were $709,993,564.02, leaving a deficit of $89J11,559 67. The Secretary of the Treasury esti- j mates that the receipts for the eurrert fiscal year will aggregate $040,958,112 and upon the basis of presert nnpro priat'ons. the expenditures wi'l a*rfirre gat« $Hf19,W5X.!12, leaving .«4O<HMi.OOO. For the fiscal year ended June 30. 1890. th° internal pwenute receipts were increased about $100,000,000. THE TREASURY IN A HEALTHY CONDITION. The present gratifying strength of the Treasury is shown by the fact that on December 1, 1X99, the available cash balance was $278,004,837.72, of which $239,744,905.30 was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions of confidence which prevail throughout the country have brought gold into more general THE 

RECORD-UNION. use, and customs receipts are now al most entirely paid in that coin. The strong condition of the Treasury with respect to cash on hand and the favorable showing made by the reve nues have made it possible for the Sec retary of the Treasury to take action under the privisions of Section 3U94, Revised Statutes, relating to the sink ing fund. Receipts exceeded expendi tures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by .513.4i:i,359.91, and as mentioned above, the Secretary of the Treasury estimates that there will be a surplus of approimately !j>4o, --000,000 at the end of the year. Under such conditions, it was deemed advisa ble and proper to resume compliance with the provisions of the sinking fund law, which for eighty years has not been done, because of deficiencies in the revenues. The Treasury Department, therefore, offered to purchase during November $25,000,000 of the 5 per cent, loan of 1904, or the 4 per cent, funded loan of 1907, at the current market price. The amount offered and pur chased during November was $18,408, --000. The premium paid by the Govern ment on such purchases was $2,203,521, and the net saving in interest was about 52,8N5.000. The success of this operation was sufficient to induce the Government to continue the offer to purchase bonds to and including the 23d day of December, instant, unless the remainder of the $25,000,000 called for should be presented in the mean time for redemption. » THE CIRCULATING MEDIUM. Increased activity in industry, with its welcome attendant—a larger em ployment for labor at higher wages gives to the body of the people a larger power to absorb the circulating me dium. It is further true that year by year, with larger areas of land under cultivation, the increasing volume of agricultural products, cotton, corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume- of money supply. This is especially no ticeable at the crop harvesting and crop moving period. NATIONAL BANK ACT In its earlier history the National Hanking Act seemed to prove a reason able avenue through which needufl ad additions to the circulation could from tune to time be made. Changing con ditions have apparently rendered it now inoperative to that end. The high margin in bond securities required, re sulting from large premiums which give the bonds command in the n arket or the tax on note issues, or both oper ating together, appear to be the influ ences which impair its public utility. The attention of Congress is respect fully invited to this important matter with a view of ascertaining whether or not such reasonable modifications can be made in th* National Banking Act as will render its service in the par ticulars here referred to more re sponsive to the peoples' needs. 1 again urge that national hanks be author ized .to organize with a capital of $25, --000. GOLD STANDARD SHOULD BE PRKSK'IVED. I urgently recommend that to sup port the existing gold standard, and to maintain "the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and silver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market and in the payment of debts," the Secre tary of the Treasury be given addi tional power, and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds, and to em ploy such other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. The au thorities have the power to sell bonds on long and short time, as conditions may require, and should provide for a rate of interest lower than that fixed by the Act of January 14. 1875. While there- is not now commercial fright which withdraws gold from the Gov ernment, but on the contrary, such widespread confidence that gold seeks SACRAMENTO, "WEDNESD AY MORNING, DECEMBER 6, 1899.-TWELVE PAGES. the treasury, demanding paper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the present as the most fitting time to make adequate provision to in sure the continuance of the gold stand ard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of the Government to meet all its obligations in money which the civilized world recognize. The financial transactions of the Government are conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States bonds, and use gold for their payment. We are maintaining the parity of all the money issued or coined by authority of the Government. We are doing these things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we are not compelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past, however, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us, therefore, to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency %vhen it arises, and the best means are those which are the most certain and eco nomical. Those now authorized have the virtue neither of directness nor economy. We have already eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight and embarrassment during the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 189(1. Our receipts now equal our expenditures; deficient rev enues no longer create alarm. Let us remove the only remaining cause by conferring the full and necessary power on the Secretary of the Treas ury, and impose upon him the duty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a parity with each other, which is the repeatedly declared policy of the United States. In this connection, I repeat my former recommendations, that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed shall not thereafter be paid out except for gold. 

MERCHANT MARINE. Congress Urged to Take Immediate Action for Strengthening It. The value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our com mercial trade and the strengthening of our power upon the seas invites imme diate action of Congress. Our national development will be one-sided and un satisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our inland industries remains unaccompanied by progress on the seas There is no lack of constitutional au thority for legislation which shall give to the country maritime strength com mensurate with industrial achievements and with its rank among the nations of the earth. The past year has recorded excep tional activity in our ship yards, and the promises of continual prosperity in ship-building are abundant. Advanced legislation for the protection of our sea men has been enacted. Our coast trade, under regulations wisely frarried at the beginning of the Government and since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequalled in our records of those of any other Power. We shall fail to realize our opportunities, however, if we complacently regard only matters at home, and blind ourselves to the necessity of securing our share in the valuable carrying trade of the world. Last year American vessels trans ported a smaller share of our exports and imports than during any former year in all our history, and the meas ure of our dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to our people. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the depart ments of the Government charged with military and naval operations in the East and West Indies had to obtain from foreign flags merchant vessels es sential for those operations. The other great nations have not hes itated to adopt the required means to develop their shipping as a factor in national defense, and as one of the surest and speediest means of obtain ing for their producers a share in for eign markets. Like vigilance and ef fort on our part cannot fail to im prove our situation, which is regarded with humiliation at home and with surprise abroad. Even the seeming sac rifices, which at the beginning may be involved, will be offset later by more than equivalent gains. The expense is as nothing compared to the advantage to be achieved. The. re-establishment of our merchant ma rine involves in a large measure our continued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial triumphs. I am satisfied the judgment of the country is a policy of aid to our mer chant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild our sea-carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture, and which, with the increase in our navy, means more work and wages to our countrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of the world. COMBINES AND TRUSTS. The Early Attention of Congress Called to the Matter. Combinations of capital organized into trusts, to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle com petition, limit production and deter mine the prices of products used and consumed by the people, are justly pro voking public discussion, and should early claim the attention of< the Con gress. The Industrial Commission, created by the Act of Congress of June 18, 1898, has been engaged in extended hearings upon the disputed questions* involved in the subject of combination In re straint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed their investi gations of this subject, and the conclu sions and recommendations at which they may arrive are undetermined. The subject is one giving ri~e to many divergent views as to the nature and variety or cause and extent of the injuries to the public which may re sult from large combinations connect ing more or less numerous enterprises and establishments which previously to the formation of the combination were carried on separately. It is universally conceded that com binations which engross or control the market of any particular kind o"f mer chandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by suppress ing natural and ordinary competition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law, but also as to the public welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils involved in such organizations. If the prerent law can be extended more certainly to con trol or check these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without de lay. Whatever power Congress pos sesses over this most Important subject should be promptly ascertained and as serted. President Harrison, in his annual message of December 3, 1889, says: "Earnest attention should be given by Congress to a consideration of the ques tion how far the restraint of those com binations of capital, commonly called 'trusts', is matter of Federal jurisdic tion. When organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy competi tion, and to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commerce and general necessity, they are dangerous conspiracies against the public good, and they should be made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legisla tion." An Act to protect trade and com merce against unlawful restraints and monopolies was passed by Congress on the 2d of July, IS9O. The provisions of this statute are comprehensive and stringent. It declares every contract or combination in the form of a trust or otherwise or conspiracy in the re straint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign na tions, to be unlawful. It denominates as a criminal every person who makea any such contract or engages in any such combination or conspiracy and provides a punishment by fine or im prisonment. It invests the several Circuit Courts of the United States with jurisdiction to prevent and re strain violations of the Act, and makes it the duty of the several United States District Attorneys, under the direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations. It further confers upon any person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or de clared to be unlawful by the Act the power to sue therefor in any Circuit Court of the United States, without re spect to the amount in controversy, and to recover three-fold the damages by him sustained and the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorney fees. It will be perceived that the Act is aimed at every kind of combination In the nature of a trust or monopoly In restraint of interstate or international commerce. 

RAILWAY POOLINC. The prosecution by the United States of offenses under the Act of 1890 has been frequently resoi-ted to in the Fed eral Courts, and notably in the re straint of interstate commerce, such as the Trans-Missouri Freight Association and the Joint Traffic Association, have been successfully opposed and sup pressed. President Cleveland In his annual message of December 7, 1890—more than six years subsequent to the enact ment of this law—after stating the evils of these trust combinations, says: "Though Congress hag attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, th-2 laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not because ol any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of the existing laws can be remedied by further"' legislation, it should be done. The fact must be recognized, however, that all Federal legislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose, because of in herent obstacles and also because of the complex character of our govern mental system, which, while making the Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds which cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise question renders it quite - doubtful whether the evils of trusts and monopo lies can be adequately treated through Federal action, unless they seek direct ly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or intercourse between State or between the United States and foreign countries. "It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal authority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the power of the several States to act effectively in the premises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judicious ly exercise such power." The State legislation to which Presi dent Cleveland looked for relief from the evils of trusts has failed to ac complish fully that object. This is probably due to a great extent to the fact that different States take different views as to the proper way to dis criminate between evils and injurious combinations and those associations which are beneficial and necessary to the business prosperity of the country. The great diversity of treatment in different States arising from this cause and the estimate relations of all parts of the country to each other, without regarding State lines in the conduct of business, have made the enforcement of any State laws difficult. It is apparent that uniformity of leg islation upon this subject in the sev eral States is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that such uniformity founded on a wise and just discrimi nation between what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in bus iness operations may be obtained, and that means may be found for Congress, within the limitation of its constitu tional powers, to supplement an ef fective code of State legislation as to make a complete system of law throughout the United States to compel a general observance of the salutary rules to which I have referred. The whole question is so important and far-reaching that I am sure no part of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of It will have the studied deliberation of the Congress, resulting in wise and judicious action. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Reviewed by the President, With Appropriate Recommendations. A review of our relations with for eign States is presented, with such rec ommendations as are deemed appropri ate. The long pending boundary dispute between the Argentine Republic and Chile was settled in March last by the award of an arbitration commission on which the United States Minister at Buenos Ayres served as umpire. Progress has been made toward the conclusion of a convention of extradi tion with the Argentine Republic. Hav ing been advised and consented to b/ the United States Senate and ratified by- Argentine, it only awaits the adjust ment of some slight changes in the text before exchange. on Eighth Page.) 

ROBERTS WAS NOT SWORN IN. The House Yesterday Decided by an Overwhelming Majority To Refer the Case of the Poljgamlst to a Committee for Investigation. The Galleries Again Thronged With Spectators, Who Sat for Hours Awaiting the Decision in the Case—The President's Mes sage Read in Both Houses. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—After an in teresting debate of three hours, the House to-day, by a vote of 302 to 30, adopted the resolution offered by Tay ler of Ohio yesterday for the appoint ment of a special committee to investi gate the charges against Brigham H. Roberts, the Mormon Representative elect from Utah. Previously the House had rejected a substitute resolution of fered by Richardson, the leader of the minority, to allow Mr. Roberts to be sworn in and then send the whole case to the Judiciary Committee. This sub stitute resolution, however, by %io means commanded the full Democratic strength. Only fifty-seven members voted for it. Of the thirty who th?n voted against the Tayler resolution all were Democrats except two, Loud, a California Republican, and Newlands, a Silverite from Nevada. By the terms of the resolution Mr. Roberts is not excluded from all partic ipation in the proceedings of the House until the committee reports and the House passes upon his case, but he is denied a seat in the hall. Whether this will be interpreted to deny him ad mission within the chamber pending the disposition of his case is yet to be decided. The reading of the President's mes sage was completely overshadowed by the dramatic proceedings which result ed in the action of the House to-day. The galleries were thronged with spec tators, mostly women, who sat patient ly through the three weary hours that preceded the debate, and then waited on three hours- more until it was con cluded. The most remarkable feat ure of the debate was the fact that Mr. Roberts' presentation of his own side of the case, which lasted almost an hour, became so absorbing that he won the sympathy of those in the gal leries, and was several times showered with applause. It was evident that he realized that the House was over whelmingly against him, and at times he spoke fiercely and defiantly. Tayler conducted the case upon his side, while Richardson championed his resolution. During the debate Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio rose to indignantly repel an in sinuation of Mr. Roberts that the Pres ident had knowingly appointed men guilty of polygamy to Federal offices in Utah. 

HOUSE PROCEEDINGS. Decided by a Large Majority Not to Swear in Roberts. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The gal leries of the House to-day were almost as crowded as on yesterday, the debate on the Roberts case being the attrac tion. The reading of the President's message, usually a great attraction, was completely overshadowed by the universal interest in the disposition of the case of the Mormon Representative from Utah. The fact that three fourths of the spectators in the galleries were women was particularly noticea ble, and was a tangible manifestation of the interest of th fair sex in the re sult. Mr. Roberts himself'entered the hall about 11:10 a. m. and immediately be came the cynosure of all eyes. Just before the House convened he took the seat he selected yesterday on the ex treme right of the Democratic side. It developed that Mr. Roberts' name was not on the official roll call of the House, so that in case of vote or other action by the House he would not be a participant. This was in accord with ail precedents. Representative Richardson, the Democratic floor lead er, said that no exception could be taken to this procedure. At 12 o'clock Speaker Henderson called the members to order. All arose in their places, Mr. Roberts included, and stood with bowed heads while the Chaplain delivered his invocation. After the reading of the journal had been concluded Cannon, from the-com mittee appointed yesterday to wait upon the President, reported that the President would communicate In writ ing. Immediately thereafter 'Major Pru den, the President's Executive Clerk, announced the message, and It was at once laid before the House. The members llsened attentively to the reading. The reading of the message consumed two and one-half hours, and at the conclusion the Republicans gave it a hearty round of applause. Payne (R.) of New York, the floor leader of the majority, immediately moved that the message be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the union and ordered printed. Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania expressed -a desire to debate the message, but this was declared out of order. The Speaker then laid before the House Tayler s resolution to refer the Roberts case in accordance with the agreement of yesterday. Tayler immediately took the floor. It was arranged that there should be three hours debate, - one hour on each side, one-half hour to be allowed Mr. Roberts; and to come out of the time of the minority. This arrangement having been made, Richardson, the Democratic leader, gave "notice of a substitute he would offer as follows: "Whereas. Brigham H. Roberts, from the State of Utah, has presented a cer tificate of election in due and proper form, as a Representative from same State; therefore, be it "Resolved, That without expressing any opinion as to the right or propriety of his retaining his seat in advance of any proper investigation thereof, the said Brigham H. Roberts is entitled to be sworn in as a member of this House upon his prima facie case. "Resolved further, That when worn, his credentials and all the papers i n relation to his right to retain his seat be referred to the Committee on Judic iary, with instructions to report there on at the earliest practicable moment.' - Tayler then opened his speech in favor of the adoption of his resolution. He would not urge its adoption, he said, were he not prompted by a high sense of duty. The Constitution was con sistent, he continued, if it was con tended that the limitations it imposed were not to be added to. The power of Congress to halt the claimant at the door, he insisted, was clear. The in eligibility created by conviction for crime was a power inherent in govern ment, irrespective of the Constitution. He cited several cases to show that as punishment for crime the Legislature had ample authority to disqualify a man from holding office. When Tayler began to speak Mr. Roberts left the seat' he had been occu pying and took a seat near the main aisle, where he could hear with greate. ease. Throughout Tayler's remarks he sat facing his accuser, except when he turned to his desk to take notes of the points to which he desired to reply. Continuing, Tayler read a decision of the Supreme Court defining polygamy, which stated, irrespective of whether a man had contracted a plural marriage after the passage of the Edmunds Act, and irrespective of whether he had since cohabited with a plural wife, he was guilty of polygamy if he still main tained the relation of husband to more than one wife. . Referring again to the two procla mations of amnesty, he argued that the claimant was in no better position than he would have been had no such pro clamation been issued. But higher than the civil law was a law of civilization, which demanded that one so tainted should be excluded. There were precedents for such an appeal to the higher law. He cited the case of Whittemore, who had been guilty of selling cadetships, and who upon his appearance at the bar of the House was rejected as unfit to sit in the House. The power and the right were Inherent, said Tayler. It was only a question of propriety, of wisdom and of precedent. In all his investigation and study of precedents, Mr. Tayler said, he had failed to find a single case where the House had hesitated to as sert upon proper occasion its right to halt a member at the bar, when his qualifications for a seat were ques tioned. He quoted extensively from "McCreary on Elections" in support of his argument. He reviewed the cases of Proctor Knott, Boyd 'Winchester and John M. Rice of Kentucky, who had been stopped at the bar of the House on the ground that they were disquali fied because they had been disloyal. "We are told," staid Mr. Tayler, in conclusion, his voice ringing out clearly, "that we are about to create an un happy precedent. Why, Mr. Speaker, we are doing this in the open gaze of the whole world, not in a cloistered court. We are the servants of the peo ple, empowered to do the right as we see it. The public eye is upon us, the conscience quickens us. In that pres ence we can do no wrong if we do but obey it." Tayler's concluding words were greeted with a storm of applause, both from the floor and the galleries. Richardson, the minority leader, fol lowed Tayler. He did not intend, he said, to discuss the merits of the case The question at issue was as to whether the Representative-elect, Roberts, had a prima facie right for his seat. He was not willing to reject a Representative elect who appeared at the bar of the House with his credentials in due form. If he was denied admission a precedent would be created which would rise to plague the House in years to come The only constitutional objection raised against the member-elect related to his naturalization, and that, Richardson as serted, would not hold. He defied the other side to produce a single precedent where objection was raised to the administration of the oath except on constitutional grounds. The precedents cited were made during the war, and were not to be relied on. Richardson declared that the minority was in nowise bound by his position. He spoke for himself alone. He was willing to say that if the charges against the member-elect were proven, he should favor his expulsion. "If there is one thing the American people are a unit on," he said, "it is that the American home shall be pre served in all its loveliness, sweetness., and purity." (Applause.) "But," he proceeded,"it is not wise to permit our judgment to be warped by public clamor. To do so amounts to condemnation without trial." Richardson then brought forward sev eral precedents in support of his posi tion. Roberts himself took the floor in his own defense, after Richardson had con cluded. He occupied a conspicuous place immediately in front of the Clerk's desk. Several legal documents were piled up in front, and a bunch of carnations lay on his desk. The most interest was manifested as he arose. Members crowded about, but were com pelled to return to their seats. The galleries were hushed. The occupants leaned over to listen, eager to let no word escape. Roberts first sent to the Clerk's desk and had read his naturalization papers. He then began to speak. His voice was soft and low, but his enunciation was distinct, and in the stillness could be heard to the farthest corner of the hall. As he got into his argument his voice grew louder, until on several oc casions it rang out until the fretted ceiling overhead gave back the echo. Roberts began by sending to the Clerk's desk and having read a copy of his naturalization papers, as he said that all the documents in this extra ordinary case should be before the House. He then read a paragraph from "McCreary on Elections." containing a general caution against hasty procedure in election contests "Now. gentlemen," continued Rob erts, "that is the statement of one whose book has authority in this coun try. And if the rule of the House of Representatives in that case arise to the dignity of a contest, how infinitely more should that rule be observed, when a mere protest is made against a member who presents himself to take the oath of office.

WHOLE 2STO. 18,988. CLARK REPLIES TO HIS ACCUSERS. Montana's Junior Representative in Upper House of Congress Makes a Statement Relative to the Recent Senatorial Contest it Helena. Leaves His Case in the Hands of the Senate, Confident That He Will be Acquitted of Every Sus picion of Guilt in Connection With the Charges of Bribery in His Election. NEW YORK, Dec. s.—The "World's" Washington correspondent telegraphs the following statement, dictated by Senator W. A. Clark of Montana: "It may seem remarkable to those who do not know our Populist Governor that he should sign such a protest, having signed my credentials after all the developments in the Senatorial con test at Helena. More than this, tha credentials were signed after thorough investigation had been made by a leg islative committee arid by a Grand Jury and after the findings of both had been repotted. Since then no new evidence has been elicited. To thosu who know Governor Smith, however, his action gives no cause for surprise. "As to the story of the $30,000 ex posure, the circumstances as related are too absurd to be creditable to any rea sonable person. The evidence given in the receht disbarment proceedings against Attorney Wellcome before the State Supreme Court of Montana by Whiteside and State Senator Mark is so conflicting and contradictory as com pared with that which they gave be fore the Grand Jury as> to entirely dis credit and make their statements nug atory and, besides the evidence of a number of the most prominent and honorable men of the State was pro duced to impeach the character of these men for veracity. "Whiteside is now uirder bond to ap pear before the District Court of the county in which he lives and will be arraigned on Wednesday to answer a charge of having attempted to bribe the Deputy County Clerk to give him access to the vaults in which the bal lot boxes were stored in No vember, 1593, at which time he was a candidate for State Senator, and believed he had been defejated. Over whelming evidence will be) produced in substantiation of this charge against Whiteside. "After Whiteside had' made his charges of bribery in the State Sen ate I demanded that a Grand Jury be called to make a most searching inves tigation. The presiding Judge charg ed the jury fully to leave no stone un turned in their efforts to reach the guilty persons if an attempt at bribery had been made. A larjre number of witnesses were examined during an in vestigation lasting two vreeks. The Grand Jury reported thai, there was no evidence upon which ati indictment could be found. "There is another thing which has been misunderstood and thaV. is that in all the so alleged cases of bribery it has not been shown in a singie instance by any evidence that any of the par ties so charged at any time voted for me. "The statements circulated to the effect that a preacher named iWarren testified that I had authorized him to pay $100,000 to a friend who, he al leged, stood ready to vote for me for a consideration, has been falsely report ed. All that lie did say, and that was an infamous lie, was that I could not consider any proposition of that kind myself, but would see that it was at tended to. "This 'divine.' during his talk with me, asked for a contribution for his church at East Helena. I gave him a check for $100. He was very careful to have the check made payable to him instead of to the Trustees of his church. After an examination of the indorse ments upon the check I am quite con fident that he pocketed the money him self, and that the church did not profit any by the contribution. "This contest instituted to-day is the culmination of an unprovoked, pernic ious, malicious and bitter warfare which haa been waged against me for twelve years by parties who have used every means to control not only the politics, but the executive, judicial and legislative departments of the State and to monopolize the vast public bus iness interests of the State. "I am quite willing to leave this mat ter in the hands of United States Sen ators, knowing that upon a full inves tigation I will be acquitted of every suspicion of guilt." Rev. Father Hespely Dead.
