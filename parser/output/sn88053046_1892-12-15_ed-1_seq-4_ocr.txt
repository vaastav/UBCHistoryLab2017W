Ihn Taxation of Iuvestiuoi The indications are that some legisla tion taxing investments will bo pressed with indefatigable vehemence before the approaching General Assembly. This may be looked for as a matter of course. A long and very determined effort in this direction was made two years ago, resulting finally in the reference of the •»ubject to a commission to examine and report. What this commission may re commend enn, of course, bo merely a matter of conjecture at this time. But the subject is one of very gréa» interest to the 65,000 people of Wilmington who represented in the legislature by two members out of thirty. This is not in any just sense a ques tion of politics. Were tiie forthcoming legislature Republican, instead of Dem ocratic, this is a subject that would have come up in about the same way that it may be expected to come up—with the majority of the members from the rural and communities predisposed in favor of the by taxation of mortgages, stocks, bonds county, and other evidences of indebtedness or Loral investment, but which appear to them Goshen evidences of taxable wealth. The de- $30,000 termination to impose such taxation is Mr. rooted in the average farmer's firm be- has lief that he pays more than his share of | Last the public burden. On the other hand, the the average Wilmiugtonian finds his nearly county tax so small a matter in com parison with his city taxes that he can with difficulty comprehend the rural feeling in the premises. To illustrate : Wo have right at hand city and county tax bills, luckily re ceipted ones, covering precisely the «aine properties. The city taxes foot up $103.77; the county taxes $35.68. In addition there is a city charge of $35 for water rent, The farmer upon the same assessment would pay the county tax of $35.63, plus a school tax and a road tax which would probably not much exceed this charge f< Having no overshadowing municipal tax to pay he feels these county taxes grievous burden; whereas the average city property holder, after he has managed to get Ids big municipal tax bill liquidated, looks upon his county tax as a small affair, parison. But we have to look at things as they are, and to begi ing that the farmer, pears to those accustomed to the pay ment of city taxes, f.-cls his county taxes as a very heavy burden which he must lighten.

And, another thing to be takon into consideration is that men do not borrow money on mortgage, generally speaking, unless they plan to make money by doing so. They purchase the temporary use of this money at six per cent, or whatever the market price of the com modity known as available capital may be, with the intent and the anticipation of bettering their own condition by doing. If suchï available capital is scarce in a community the market value of its use will naturally rule high; if, on the other hand, it is plenty, the price will bo correspond ingly low. We look upon such legis lation as that contemplated in the Fulton bill and kindred measures calculated to make such available capital scarcer and harder to get, and if that should prove to bo the result the men wiio need it will have to pay a higher price for it, in some shape, law law. That such taxation would lighten the public burden of those who do not borrow, do not go into debt, and do not invest, may prove in some de gree true. But do these fortunate people outnumber the others? "It says treme country turing tariff, But to ceeds that the panic." astrous in in for There is some information of interest and value contained iu the account giv by Mr. S. It. Downing ot Chester county, in a letter to the West Chester Loral Xcics, of the experience of East Goshen township in creating a loan of $30,000 for the building of hard roads, Mr. Downing shows that the investment has been good economy for the farmer, | Last spring it cost only $100 to repair the roads, whereas it formerly cost nearly $2,000 yearly.

Mr. Downing points that the taxes on earth roads ; bound to increase every year, and that tho longer that it is deferred the more the building of permanent roads will cost, and lie makes the claim that the build ing of permanent roads under a loan is, in his section, cheaper than building for cash. and syst. still to that not not had says the Philadelphia pension legisla tion.

HIE now About the Punic of '73? "It has been confidently asserted, says The Manufacturer , " that the ex treme depression of business in this country just previous to the war,''and particularly the depression of manufac turing industry, was due, not to the low tariff, but to the monetary panic of 1857. But the monetary panic itself was due to the low tariff." And this organ pro ceeds to lament, at considerable length, that Democratic ascendancy threatens the country with another "low tariff panic." There are two striking lapses of memory in this diagnosis. Most con spicuous of them is the entire forgetful* depressing, dis astrous and prolonged panic which set in in August, 1878, ancl from which the business of the country did not recover for four TO A Sloro of the much ing annual eration sent from and Trades rules former mittee other taulish ing Biscuit burg It the dress session the live years. Why is this? Certainly the memory which hack to 1857 should be able to include go 1873. We remember the latter panic in Wilmington. We remember that throe years after its inception its direful grip was still so severely felt, that unem ployed workingmen, including even many skilled mechanics, thronged the Martin Farrell meetings at the City Hall to plead for the privilege of doing laboring work at laborers' wages on the Cool Springfeservoirexcavation. Turn ing back at random to office tiles we quote tho following from the Delaware Gazette of July Oth, 1874—when this terrible panic had been running nearly a year—as showing.thc condition of the industry at that time: In the city of Reading. 1'n., a great iron manufacturing centre, the loading estab lishments in which this most i business 1s conducted : railroad company's shops i short time and but force is employed at the car shops, great measure ;l similar state of affairs ex ists or has existed recently iu this city. in Reading and Berks' county, says the Reading a number of iron furnaces are out of blast while others arc running a limited capacity and stacking unsold their yards; which fac to impress the community that something is radically wrong in the matter of iron production, consumption und trade in I'onnsyivania. This question is highly important and one that concerns a great many people in this city and the entire iron country of Pennsylvania.

Yet this was 1er a protective tariff syst< not attributable to the war for that had ended over eight years before, not due to "low tariff," for the tariff had been continuously high for 13 years. Will The Manufacturer kindly explain what did cause it? is the is II Muii, the in The other lapse of memory of which we speak is the attribute trente depre country just previous to the war" to the monetary panic of 1857.
