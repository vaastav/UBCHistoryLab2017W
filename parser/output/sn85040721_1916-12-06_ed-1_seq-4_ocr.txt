The Leader Bureau. Washington, D. C., Dec. 5, 1916. THE RAILROAD QUESTION. By J. E. Jones. President Wilson, In his message to congress, on December 7 of last year, suggested the wisdom of “tak ing anew assessment” of the rail roads and their relations to the pub lic. Asa result, the Newlands’ com mittee, made up from members ol both houses of congress, was created. Mr. Alfred P. Thom, who made the opening statement to the Newlands’ joint committee on interstate com merce at the beginning of its sessions, in prefacing an analysis of the condi tions that are hampering railroad de velopment, admitted on behalf of the railroads that the principle of public regulation is recognized as a perma nent part of government. He said that public regulation of railroads be came a fact twenty-nine years ago and that the fight against the railroads since then has proceeded to a large degree along the lines of “a system of correction.” In comparing the super vision of banks and railroads, he as serted that the government’s treat ment of the banks was in the nature of a constructive program; that the supervision of railroads was “part of a destructive program.” P'or a dozen years “The Railroad Question” has been constantly before the American people. The difficulty has been that as soon as one phase of the problem began to be under stood by the part of the people that might be described as “our thoughtful citizenship,” some violent twist ot conditions has completely changed the entire situation, and “the railroad question” suddenly resolved itself in to brand new shape. La Follette and Cummins fought the old regime that manipulated the railroads. They early realized that constructive legis lation to properly deal with the great “railroad question” should be enacted by the federal government; and both of them became ardent advocates of regulation by the national government, acknowledging the futility of forty six or forty-eight states attempting to govern interstate commerce. Congress has now assumed control of the railroad question and promises to rectify the indiscriminate legisla tion fostered at the instance of politi cians who have ridden into public office through the prejudices they cre ated against public service corporat ions. There has been a merry havoc of a time in railroad affairs, running over the course of a number of years. Re-organization plans, receiverships and bankruptcy have menaced the country’s great transportation inter ests. Congressman Adamson, vice chair man of the joint committee of con gress, which is charged with investi gating the entire railroad problem, has declared that the “railways must be protected.” Mr. Adamson is authot of the eight-hour law, and this piece of government policy may fall within the scope of the investigation. Sena tor Cummins, who is also on the com mittee. is expectant 'f real results at the reforms he has so long advocated. Congressman Esch, early identified with the Wisconsin movement, is a member of the committee. Senatoi 

THINK OF IT! Wisconsin Gas & Electric Company TELEPHONE 94 Newlands. one of the earliest advo cates of federal incorporation of rail road companies, is chairman. Other members are Senator Underwood, of Alabama: Robinson, of Arkansas; Brandegee, t f Connecticut; and Rep resentatives Sims, of Tennesse; Cul lop of Indiana; and Hamilton of Mich igan. Stripped of “whereases” and re solves” the entire situation brings it self down to the point where the gov ernment is convinced that the rail roads have suffered enough from hap hazard legislation, and the opinion is general that the railways at this time, are as a rule, efficiently and honestly managed. At any rate, they repre sent such an enormous property value, and are so vital to the industrial and social existence of the country, as to demand that the responsibility to the public—regardless of capital invested in the properties, calls for a perma nent “show down,” and a business like adjustment of the relations be tween the people’s government and the railroad interests." Government own ership” is one of the angles to the problem that will be taken up. Government control, of the most far-reaching kind, is certain to fol low as a result of the investigation. Rates, securities —and possibly even the question of wages, and the hours of a day’s labor, are among the mat ters sought to be regulated. However, there is no dispositon to interfere with the valuation and taxation of physi cal property within the recognized powers of the states. The present temper of administra tion leaders, and congress, is to dis countenance a continuance of the ex isting dual system of state and federal railroad control and to remedy the evil by assuming full authority on be half of the federal government. As one of the results of the present inquiry it is probable that the inter state commerce commission will be enlarged and its power extended to cover all carriers of interstate com merce. It is suggested that districts for the hearing of cases and the settl ing of disputes may be established, somewhat along the plan of the fed eral judicial system, where district judges try local causes of action. If this plan prevails, the right of appeal to the interstate commerce commis sion, as now- established in the na tional capital, will doubtless be pro vided for. It is also suggested that regional divisions of the interstate commerce commission may be estab lished, as has been done in the con trol of the banking system of the country. Perhaps, after all, it is true that the United States is entering upon anew era in its industrial affairs. In any event, congress and the administra tion never undertook a bigger or more important task than that of “settling the railroad question,” which it now seems to be attacking in earnest. 

GOETHALS AND IIIS CRITICS. General Goethals says: “As pre dicted at the time the great Culebra movements occured, the slides will be overcome finally and for all time, not withstanding the calamity howlers and in spite of the disastrous predic tions of the know-it-alls.” While General Goethals and his as sociates have proven themselves to be first-class mining engineers, they have been unable to withstand the constant criticism that has been heap ed upon them. Perhaps the principal part of this criticism has been from concerns interested In the manner in which the dredging is done, who miss the plums that fell into their laps when steam shovels were in opera tion. It is charged that these inter ests attempted to close the canal en tirely, and to have a great section of the country drained, in order that the more inexpensive method of “wet dredging” might be replaced by the spectacular, but very expensive meth od of the steam shovel. The rivalry among contractors like ly furnishes the reason for the “nig ger in the wood pile.” o THE FARM HOME. Our homes are much more than the houses in which we live. Rooms, fur niture, pictures and household things are all necessary but these do not make a home. Sometimes we are given to think ing only in terms of buildings, .cattle and fields. Our ever increasing du ties leave little time for the stury of the trees, shrubs, and wild flowers, the distant views, the lakes, and the streams with which we are blessed here in Wisconsin. All of these, how ever, should be a part of w-hat we call home. All should play a part in the development of our every day life. Our native trees, bushes and wild flowers should, together with our buildings and fields, say not “1 Am Rich,” but “This Is My Home;” not “Keep of the Grass,” but “Wel come, My Friend.” We of today are building our homes of the future. Let us plan well. Plant trees, shrubs and flowers so our home grounds will be a part of the landscape, so our houses will be our homes not bare buildings set on hill tops. o “That the intelligence and the in tegrity of its citizens who live in the open country constitute the corner stone of a democracy is generally ac cepted, but the value V'hich women have in the upbuilding and perpetu ation of a worthy rural life has been largely overlooked until in a very re cent period.” — : o EXPERT WILL ADVISE BOY BEEF RAISERS. Wisconsin farm boys who desire further practical advice on feeding baby beef for market have a friend in the person of James G. Imboden Decatur, president of-the Illinois Live Stock association. Mr. Imboden, in a letter to the secretary of the Wis consin Live Stock Breeders’s associ ation. expresses himself as being will ing to answer questions on feeding, should any Wisconsin boys engaged in the business care to write him on this subject. >‘Teli the boys not to hesitate to write me about their feeding prob lems,” Mr. Imboden states, and if I can assist them I shall be glad to do so.” The splendid showing made by the twenty-six animals which wer'- en tered in the recent boys’ bab.- beef show at Madison, where Mr. Imboden acted as judge, is responsible for the continued interest in the work taken by these well known cattle feeder.
