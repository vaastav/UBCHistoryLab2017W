In these particulars it is in conformity with the existing civil service sys ttJoi of Great Biitain and indeed the success which has attended that system in the country of its birth is the strongest argument which has been urged for its adop tion here. The fact should not, however, be overlooked that thre are certain features of the English system which have not generally been received with favor in this country even among the foremost advocates of civil service reform. Among them are first, a tenure of office which is substantially a life ten ure. Second, a limitation of the maximum age at which an applicant can outer the service u hereby ail men in middle life or under arc with some exceptions, rigidly excluded; third, a retiring allowance upon going out of service. Ihcse three elements are as important factors of the problem as any of the others. To elim inate therefrom the English system would effect a most radical change in its theory and practice. The avowed purpose of that system is to induce the educated vonng men of the country to devote their lives to the public employment by an assurance that having once entered upon it they never need leave it and that after voluntary retirement they shall be the recipients of an annual pension. * That this system as an entuety has proved very success ful in Great Britain seems to he generally con ceded, even by those who once opposed its adoption. To a statute which should incorpo rate all its essential features I should feel bound to give my approval but whether it would be for the best mterest of the public to fix upon an expedient for an immediate extensive application which embraces certain features of the English system, but excludes or ignores others of equal importance, may be strenuously doubted even hy those who are im pressed as I am with the grave importance of correcting the evils which inherit from thefireront methods of appointment. For example: The English rale which shuts out persons above tire age of 25 years from a large number of public employments should not to be made an essen tial part of our system. It is ouestiouable whether the attainment of the highest num ber of marks at a competitive examination should be the criterion bv which applications for appointment should be put to test, and under similar conditions may also be questioned whether admission to the service should be strictly limited to its lowest ranks. There are ve? y many characteristics which go to make a model civil servant, and prominent among them are probity, industry, goodness, good habits, good temper, patience, order, courtesy, tact, self-reliance, manly deference to superior officers and manly con siderations fOr inferiors. The absence of these traits is not supplied by a wide knowledge of books, or by promptitude in answering ques tions, or by any other quality likely to be brought to light by a competitive examination. To make a success in such contests, therefore, an indispensible condition of public employ ment would very likely result in the exclusion of the older applicants, even though they might possess qualifications far superior to their younger and more brilliant comoeti tors. These suggestions must not be re garded as evincing any spirit of opposition to the competitive plan, which has been to some extent successfully employed al ready, and which may hereafter vindicate the claims of its most earnest supporters: but it ought to be seriously considered whether the application of the same educational standard to persons of mature years, to young men fresh from school and college, would not be likely to exalt mere intellectual proficiency above other qualities of equal or greater importance. Another feature of the proposed system is the selection by promotion of all officers of the government above the lowest grade, except such as would fairly be regarded as exponents of the policy of* the executive and the principles of the dominant party. To afford encouragement to faith ful public servants by exciting in their minds the hope of promotion if they are found to merit it is much to be desired; but would it be | wise to adopt a rule so rigid as to permit no I other mode of supplying the intermediate walks of the service ? There are many persons who i till subordinate positions with great credit but lack those qualities which are requisite for j higher posts of duty; and besides the mod*- of thought and action of one whose service ! iu a governmental bureau has beeu long con tinued are often so cramped by routine proceed ing as almost to disqualify him from instituting j the changes required by the public interests, and an infusion of new blood from time to time ; into the middle ranks of the service might be very beneficial in its results. The subject tin- j der discussion is one of grave importance. The ' errors which are complained of caunot be erad icated at ence. The work must be gradual. The present English system is a growth of years and was not created by a single stroke of executive or legislative action. Its beginning i is found in an order in the council promulga ! ted in 1855, and it was after patient and cau tious scrutiny of its workings that, fifteen years ; later, it took its present shape. Five years after I the issuance of the order in council and at a | time when resort had been to competitive ex amination as an experiment much more exten sively than has yet been the case in this coun- , try, a select committee of the house of ; commons made a report to that j house which declaring its approval cf the com petitve method deprecated nevertheless any precipitancy iu its genera! adoption as likely to i endanger its ultimate success. During this , tentative period the results of the two methods of pass examination and competitive examina- i tion was closely watched and compared. It mav be that before we confine ourselves upon this important question within the stringent bounds.of statutory enactment we may profit ably await the result of further inquiry and experiment. The submission of a portion of the nominations to a central board of examiners selected solely for testing the qnali fications of applicants may perhaps, without re- I sort to the competitive test put an end to the i mischief which attends the present system of appointment, and it may be feasible to vest in such a board a wide discretion to ascertain the characteristics and attainments of the candi dates in these particulars which I have already referred to as bring no less important than tha mere intellectual attainment. If congress should deem it advisable at the present session to establish competitive tests for admission to the service, no doubts such as have been suggested shall deter me from giving the measure my earnest support, and I urgently recommend that should there be a failure to pass any other act on this sub ject, an appropriation of $25,000 per year be made for tlie enforcement of section 1,753 of the revised statutes. With the aid thus afford ed me I shall strive to execute the provisions of that law according to its letter and spirit. I am unwilling in justice to the present civil ser vants of the government to dismiss this subject without declaring my dissent from the severe and almost indiscriminate censure with which they have been recently assaulted. That they are as a class indolent, inefficient and corrupt is a statement which has beeu often made and widely credited; but when the extent, variety, delicacy nd importance of their duties are con sidered", tue great majority of the employes of the government are, iu my judgment, deserving of high commendation. 

MERCHANT MARINE. The continned decline of the merchant ma rine of the United States is to be greatly de plored. In view of the fact that we furnish so large a proportion of the freights of the com mercial world, and that our shipments are steadily and radidly increasing, it is a cause of surprise that not only is our navigation interest diminishing, but it is less than when our ex ports and imports were not half so large as now, either in bulk or in value. There must be some peculiar hinderance to the develop ment of this interest, or the enterprise and energy of American mechanics and capitalists would have kept this country at least abreast of our rivals in the friendly contest for ocean supremacy. The substitution of iron for wood and of ste*m for sail have wrought great revolutions in the carrying trade of the world, but those changes could not have teen adverse to America if we had given to our navigation interests a portion of the aid in protection which have been so widely bestowed upon our manufactures. I commend the whole subject to tbe wisdom of congress, with the suggestion that uo question of greater magnitude or farther-reaching importance can engage their attention. In 1875 the supreme court of the United States declared unconsti tutional the statues of certain states which im posed on ship-owners or consignees a tax of £1.50 for each passenger arriving from a foreign country or, in lieu thereof, re quired a bond to indemnify the state and local authorities against expense for the future relief or support of such pas senger. Since this decision the expense at tending the care and supervision of immigrants has fall on the states at whose port they have landed. Asa large majority of such immi grants immediately on arrival proceed to the inland states and territories to seek permanent homes it is manifestly unjust to impose on tbe state whose shores they first reach the burden wicch it now bears, bor this r. aeon, and le canse of the national importance of the sub jet't. I recommend legislation regarding tbe -oijiervisioii. AI-ASKA. . I regret to state that tbe people of Alaska i have reason to complantthat they are as yetun | provided with any form of government by which life or property can be protected. While the extent of its population docs not justify the application of the costly machinery of ter ritorial administration, there is immediate necessity for constituting such a form of gov ernment as will promote the education of the people and secure the administration of justice. CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY. The senate at its last session passed a bill providing for the construction of a building for the library of congress, but it failed to become a law. The provision of such protection for this great collection of books and for the de partment connected with it, has become a sub ject of national importance, and should receive prompt attention. PISTBICT OF COLUMBIA. The report of the commissioners of the Dis trict of Columbia herewith transmitted will in form you fully of the condition of the affairs of the District. The vital importance of legis lation for the reclamation and Improvement of the marshes and for the establishment of the harbor lines along the Potomac River front is shown. It is represented that in their present conditions these marshes seriously af fect the health of the residents of the adjacent parts of the city and that they greatly mar the general aspect of the p&ik in which stands the Washington monument. This im provement would add to that park and the park i south of the executive mansion a large area of i valuable land and would transform wbat is now ! believed to boa dangerous nuisance into an at- j tractive landscape extending to the river-front. I They recommend the removal of the steam | railway lines from the surface of the streets of , the city and the location of the necessary depots in such places as may be convenient for ! the public accommodation; they call attention j to the deficiency of the water supply which 1 seriously affects the material prosperity of the city and' the health and comfort of its inhabi tants, I commend these subjects to your fa vorable consideration. 

I’BESIPENTIAL ELECTORS. The importance of timely legislation with respect to the ascertainment and declaration of the vote for presidential electors was sharply called to the attention of the people more than four years ago, and it is to be hoped that some well-defined measure may be devised before another national election, which will render unnecessary a resort to any expedient of a tem porary character for the determination of ques lic ns upon contested returns. THE “INABILITY ” QUESTION. Questions, which concern the very existence of the government and the liberties of the peo ple, were suggested bv the prolonged illness of (he late president and his consequent incapacity to perform the functions of his office. It is provided by the second article of the constitu tion in the fifth clause of its first section, that, in case of the removal of the President from office or of his death, assassi nation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office, the same shall de volve on the vice president. What is the in tention of the constitution in its speculation of j “inability to discharge the powers and duties i of said office ?” Is one of the contingencies j that which calls the vice president to the exer- | cise of presidential functions? Is the inability delegated in its nature to long continued intellectual incapacity or has it broader import? What must be its extent and duration? llow must its existence be established? Has the president, whose inability is the subject of inquiry, any voice in determining whether or | not it exists? or is the decision of that moment- | ous and delicate question confined to I the vice president? or is it contemplated! by the constitution that congress j should provide by law precisely i what should constitute inability, and how and j by what tribunal or authority it should be ascer tained ? If the inability proves to be temporary in nature, and during its continuance the vice president lawfully exercises the functions of the executive, by what tenure does be hold the office ? Does he continue as Presi dent for the remainder of the four years term, or would the eieeted President, if his ; inability should cease in the interval j be empowered to resume his offices, and if hav- ' ixig such equal authority, he should exercise it, would the vice president be thereupon em powered to resume his powers and duties as such? I cannot doubt that these important questions will receive your early and thought ful consideration. Deeply impressed with the gravity of there- ! sponsibilitics which have so unexpectedly de- j volved upon me it will be my constant purpose to co-operate with you in such measures as will promote the glory of the country and the pros perity of its people. .Signed, Chester A. Arthur. Washington, D. C., December 6, 1881.
