CONGRESS HITS AT ROOSEVELT. House Names Committee to Act on Part of Message that Offends. A fight between the President of the United States and Congress, which some seemed to think may exceed any breach since the famous Andrew John son impeachment case, began Friday. It was precipitated by the President attacking the integrity of the members of the House and Senate. Action against the President was taken in the House when a committee of four was appointed to deal with the objection able portions of the message. When the President, in Ids message, de clared that the main reason for ('on gress curtailing the scope of secret service operations was because the members themselves feared investiga tion. and that the* amendments benefited only criminals, he stirred up the trou ble. While the more deliberate Senate was quietly planning a rebuke to the President, the House acted openly. The resolution providing for the ’•re buke" committee was introduced by Representative Perkins of New York, as had been prearranged. The resolu tion is preceded by a preamble recit ing some expressions of the message. In presenting the resolution Mr. Per kins made a brief statement, saying that he was satisfied that the House would not hesitate to take such action, as the dignity of that body required.
