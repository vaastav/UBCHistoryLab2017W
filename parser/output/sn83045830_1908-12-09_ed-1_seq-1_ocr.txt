(By Associated Press.) WASHINGTON. |) C. Dec. k ?In terest in lioiii houses of Congers* centered today in Ihe President's! message. Senator Aidrich. on behalf of the Senate committee and Repre- | sentative Payne for the House com? mittee appointed >o notify the Presi? dent tha: the two bodies were in ses? sion, informed their respective houses that they had performed this duty. I Secretary Latta followed close upon the heels of the two committee, first in the Senate and then tu the House. The reading of the message began in the Senate at 12:15 and in the. House a few minutes later. Both Houses Filled. The galleries of both Houses were well filled, and almost all the seats of senators and meml.?'rs were occu? pied by their owners. All of them were supplied with printed copies of the message which proved to be a document of for'-y four printed pages; with an elaborate AiMr,'>'iiv containing numerous illus "'*^?rons tthowing the results of the work of the forestry bureau. Senators and members gave com? paratively little attention to the read? ing of the message at the desk, but most of them immediately busied themselves with the printed copies before them. The message which contained near? ly 20.0HO words, is given in part be? low: To the Senate and House of Repre? sentatives: The financial standing of the Nation at the present time is excellent, and 1 the financial management of the j Nation's interests by the Government ? during the last seven years has shown the most . satisfactory results. But our currency svstem is imperfect, and it is earnes'ly to be hoped that the Currency Commission will- be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. . During the period from July 1, 1901. to September 30, 19i?8. there was an i increase in the amount of money in ] circulation of $902.991..199. The in? crease in the per capita dur'ng Ibis period was $7.06. Wltliin this time there were several occasions when , it was necessary for the Treasury De- j partment to come to the relief of the ] money market by purchases or re- i dempjions of United States bonds; by ] Increasing d?-'poll's ih national banks; by stimulatinc additional issues of national bank r.otes and by facili'a- ' ting importations from abroad of gold. ' Our Imperfect currency system has made these proceej'ngs necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 190" im mediately increased the difficult-, of ordinary methods of relief. By the middle of Novessber the available work'ng balance la the Treasury had been redifccd to approximately $."1.000. 0O0. Clearing honse associations Ihrcnghont the rowatry had been oblig? ed to rescrt to the expedient of ;s rniBir clearing house certificate.--, to re? used as money.

Corporations. As regards the gn at corporations] engggej in interstate iiusine-.s. and ? ?specially the railroads. I can onlr icp-at what I have already again and again said In iny message to the Con grcrs. I believe that under the inter stale clat so of the Constitution the United States has complete and paiamount right to control all agen < ies of interstate commerce, and I believe thai the National Cover;: ment alone can ?exerc'se this right with wisdom and effectiveness so ;i both lo secure justice from ami to do justice to. the gnat corporation.' which are the most important fac? tors in modern business. I believe thai it is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit ail combinations as is done by the Sherman anti trust law. be? cause such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and unequally, and.its en? forcement wUrws almost as much haidship as good. I strongly advo? cate that instead of an unwise effort to proh'bit all combinations, then shall be substituted a law which sh'U! fxpress.lv permit combinations which are in the interest cf the public.
