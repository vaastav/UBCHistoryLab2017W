Holland and Venezuela Nearing Clashing Point. UNCLE SAM IS WATCHFUL Dutch Battleship Arrives In Harbor of Willemsted Having In Tow the Coast Guard Vessel Captured, With The Netherlands Flag Flying. Washington, Dec. 15. The existence of what amounts practically to a atate of war between Holland and Vene tuela, the absence for the first time In many years Id an acute crisis of this kind of American warships from their proper sphere influence, and the pro fession by the state department offi cials of their Ignorance of (he Inten tions of Holland, constitute a most serious and interesting international situation. So long as the Dutch ships act strictly within the lines of the Mon roe doctrine as construed in the an nual message to congress of President Roosevelt last year, so long as no at tempt hi made to Bel?.e Venezuelan territory for permanent occupation; so long as Dutch warship captains con fine their activities to the seizure of Venezuelan ships and blockade ports and thus attempt to redress the af front to Holland's honor, there will probably be no Interference on the part of the I'nited States government. This telegram was received from Wlllemstad: 'The Dutch battleship Jacob von Heemskerk arrived in the harbor towing as a price the Venezue lan cout- Hardship. "23 de Mayo." f the capture had already been elved here and a great throng of people lined the quays to witness the entrance of the Dutch battleship con ducting her capture within the harbor.

The Dutch eriuser Gelderland left for the Venezuelan coast. She had on board seamen thoroughly ac quainted with the small bays and In lets along the Venezuelan shores. The "23 de Mayo," while classed as a coat guardxhlp. Is a unit of the Venezuelan navy, but her size and strength are Insignificant. She Is of 130 tons and armed with one machine gun. The Gelderland started out after the Venezuelan torpedo boat Marflarlta, a steel vessel of ninety-seven tons, and armed with four three-pounders and two torpedo tubes. This vessel Is supposed to be off the Island of Mar garita. The Jacob von Heemskerk will leave here at once to resume her pa trol ervlce on the coast.
