At that time only one Jeveoteenth part of the actual culting of the Enl had bosn finishod, while the expenses so ir incurred nmountod to one-sixth of tlio estimated total Outlay. Commander Gorringe tonoluded that the canal would oust eventually 130,000,000, and would be completed at the late- by January 1, 1890. The American contractor, Nathaniel McKny, reports that 20,000 rativos ot the Carribee Islands are employed in piercing the isthmus. They earn $1.50 to $2 daily. They are now mostly occupied in cutting immense trenohos through the hills, which will bo carried down to a level with the oocnu. When this wo;k is finished and the river Ch g (is has beon turned Iroiu iu oau rse, the most ar luous part of the andertaking will be ovor. ihen excavating and iredghi mai hinory will be set at Work along the whole oourso of the luture canal.

Representative Collins ot Massachusetts, who has ehavgo of the bankruptcy bill reported from tho Home committee on the judiciary las' session, in an interview with an Associated Pxess representative said: "An effort is being made to learn if members who wera opposed to tho measuro have changed their minds since tho rooent clcotiou. On May 19th an effort was made to consider tho bill in the House under suspension of rules, or to have a day set apart for its consideration. A two-thirds vote otouiso'Sio object? oi'tflie'(r??en3? &? InblJul was defeated. It will be necessary to seouie 20 or 30 votes Irom tho opponents of the mea suro to pass it. Tho greatest opposition is from the South and We3t. Indiana, Missouri and Kentucky are almost solidly opposed to it. Without seouring the necessary two-thirds voto to get a suspension of the rules, there is no hope tor the bill. It is on the calendar, and in Suoh a position that it will be impossible to roach it in so short a session. An attempt to Suspend the rules will be made in tho early part of January."

PERILOUS BUSINESS. sour White Men Drowned Smuggling Chinamen. While A few days since it was reported at Victoria B. C, that a throe-ton sloop which lolt there with 9 Chinamen, who were to be smuggled nnd two white men .for the American shorn linH swamped, and nil hands were lost In addi tion to this disaster, two more white men who left Foul Bay ab jut seven weeks ago in a leaky boat, with 12 Chinamen, for Washington territory, havo not since been hoard of, and nil are believed to have been drowned. The temptation to go into smuggling Chinamen across Hie border is very strong, as lor each one mnaea me owners ot tlie boat receive gen erally S25, a sum which well repays those who make the venture, if they escape with their lives, elude American customs ffioers, and manage to return to Victoria to claim their money from the agents. Capital for the South, About 100 gentlemen representing German American citizens of the States of New York and Pennsylvania, will roach Washington dur ing the holidays, en route for the World's fair at New Orleans. Thence they will send out branoh parties to explore nnd report to their people what advantages the Southern Stales offer for the investment of capital. The party will represent millions of dollars, and if they find the Southern section availuble, they intend to Introduoe their various schemes, Live Stock and Dressed Beef. At the meeting of railroad presidents in the offioe of- Commissioner Fink, New York, ie cently, it was decided to fix the rates on live stock at iO cents per 100 pounds, and on dressed best at 70 cents from Chicago to New York, the change to go into effoot nt once. Tho former rates were 20 and 32 cents respectively. Judge Cooley, the arbitrator, decided tliHt horeaftor dressed beef ratos are to bo 75 per cent, greater than tho ratos for live stock. Unlucky Balloon Voyage. The balloon Eclipse, the largest ever con structed in California, which is intended to make a trip across the Rocky Mountains, made a trial ascension recently in San Frnn (iisco, but suddenly descended into Raccoon Straits, 10 miles awny. The occupants and the balloon were picked up by boats. The owner intends taking tho balloon to the World's Fair at New Orleans. Overtaken by a Squall. While eight or ten fishing sohooners wei-o ,ylng nt anchor off Digby, N. S., lately, a iquttll from tho northwest suddenly struck them with tremendous force. The vessels at bnce raised their anchors, cut their trawls, and Iran for the harbor. A schooner lost hor fore mast and jibboom, and was onable to pick np pne of hor dories containing two men, who (svere consequently drowned. 

AGAINST POLYGAMY. The Text Pr the hep3rt of the rh i'emm Ul4n The report of tho Utah oom minion, quoted in President Arthur's message, boars dute of Nov. 18. The commissioners believe that their system of registration was suceossftd in pi-eventing polygamists from voting nt tho elections of county olliceis on Aug. 4, mi l fr n congressional dclegite on Nov. 4. Tiio officers elected wero general y Mormons but wore not, in fact, living in polvgamv. Mr. C in, tlio delcgnc-elect, although a Mormon, una never i.vea iu poiygimy. Ilio commis- oilers slMe that. althoiUrh iho iaw his b-i-n ' successiuiiy administered in rospect to the tlis-frunchh-cment of po ygamists, the eflVct Ot the same nport the preaching and practice of polygamy has not been to iniprovo tho tone of the former or materially diminish tho 1 ltter. i or a year or more alter tho effort to enforce tho law was iniliatod, polvgamio teachings irom the pulpit wero rarely Jieard, and there were indications that ihe practice of polygamy might bo expected to at leust decline in a rntnsute; But diuii-g thb present year' there appears to hmo been a polygumio revival. The institution i boldly and dJli.mtly defended, nnd commended by tho spirit tench ers, and plural m irriago.i nro reported to have increased in number. Reporfs Irom all coun ties but six indicate that 198 males and 263 females have entered polygamy since the pas sage of the Edmund's act. Three-fourths or more of the Slormon adults, male or female, have never entered into the polygamic relation, yot every orthodox Mormon believes in polyg amy ns a divino revelation. A considerable portion of tha report Is dovotcd to a review of the proceedings m theClawson polygamy trial, which resulted in tho conviction of Clawson and a sentence to four years' imprisonment. The conimi-sioners th'nk it would be stranste if the conviction of Clawson should not have a restraining effect upon the young Mormons. In the Clawson case, a well ns in that of Evans, who was sentenced to 3 1-2 years' impris n ment, conv:ction was only possible through the testimony of the second wife-, which was obtained With difhcully. Should tho Senate amendments to the Edmund's net, now pond ing in the House of Representuli ves, be passed, they would greatly strengthen the hands both of the commission and the courts. Tho commissioners recommend that the offices of auditor and treasurer be fi'led by ap pointment. It is not unlikely, they remark, that finally tho federal government will find it - . t .. ... . necessary to take into its own hands all civil power in the territory. It is also recommended that the various county officers be nppointed by the Governor, subject to a mnjoiily oto of the commission for confirmation. Several changes in the powers of o:urts and methods of obtaining juries are suggested. Also, ptnnlties to bo im posed upon women for entering into polygamy. 

BELL TELEPHONE AHEAD. Judge Wallace Makes a Decision Against the Drawbaugh Patents. In the United States circuit court at New York Judge Wallace recently handed down a decision in favor of tlio Ainorionn Boll Tele phone Company in the suit brought against the People's Telephone Company to enjoin tho use by the latter of its apparatus. Tho suit, which involved a larger amount of money than uny previous suit in tho United Statoj courts, has been pending for years. The People's Tele phone Company represent the intoreslg of Daniel Drawbaugh of Millstown, P.i., who claimed that in 1860 and 1867 ho invented an appliance by which sounds could be conveyed from place to place by wire, nnd this invention Sfflolir uSJSg T.y'ldVKK thetf venWon' 'WffilM Prof. Bell lays claim to ai the original. Two years ago tho People s Telephone Company were enjoined from using their iust umcnt, pending the result of the suit in tlio United States circuit court.

In his decis'on, Judge Wallace enters a final decree making permanent the injunction already granted, and tho Peoplo's Telephone Company are prevented from using or disposing of tho instruments manufactured by them that in any way confliot with those made by Iho Bell Tele phone Company under the patents granted by Prof. Bell. In concluding his decision, Judge Wallace say s : "Without regard to other fea tures of the case it is sufficient to say that the defence is not established and the doubt raised is fatal thereto." The caso will be at on :e ap pealed to the United States supreme court. SENSATION AT OTTAWA. The Accounts of Major John Tilton to he .Investigated.

B1U were introduced (o prohibit herenftor distinctions being mado in tho military service of tho United States against any class of Ameri can citizens; to enalilo cfiicers of the army, who were promoted for g illnnt and distinguish ed services in the war ot tlio rebellion, to be retired with the lull rauk and pur of the grade to which they wci'o so- lyonlotedj td facilitate promotion throuLimt the army hy retiring from active service, upon their own application, rfiiccrs of the army who served in tho war of tho rebel lion to prevent tho nb fhtrtiori bt thd haVig nblo waters of tho United Stutoi, nnd to pro' I oct public works against trespass or injury j to authorize the transfer of or.e of the vessels of thj Greeley rolief expoditioij to tho Treasury Department for a ravende cutter', and the re tention of the other two for ne in the navy.

Mr. Vest, of Missouri, offered a resolution ireeting an investication bv the committee on Indian nffairs into all leases of lands in tlie Indian territory lor grazing or other purposes by the Indian tribes, the number of acres cm braced in the lo ises, their terms and the per sons or corporations beccmins the lessees: Iso directing the committee to investigate all tho circumstances under which the leases woie made, the means used in obtaining the leases referred to nnd whether the leases were authorized by law. He said ho had information that ovor 3,000,000 acres hud been leased, nnd that these leases had been obtained by corrup tion, fraud or violence. He would be pre pared to cive the chairman of the committee names, amounts nnd dates. A debate on tlio subject of the leases ensued. in which Messrs. Vest, D wes, Maxoy of Texas, and Beck of Kentucky, took part. The debato broadened into a general discussion of ndian lands and sunnlies. Mr. Beck stnt.nir that the government paid 40 a head for cattle worth only '12. Mr. Dawes ot Massachusetts, said vat these leases ot Indian lands, whilo wrong, were no by wire fences ot' thousands of acres of the public lands of tha United States. Of one. tract of 120,000 acres of Indian lands, ns many as 85,000 wero in the absolute and oxclusivo possession of outsiders, whose herds consumed everything that grow on if, when the Indian bureau had been obliged to advertise for be of to support the Indians ou whose reservations those herds were feeding. Ilud tho Indians used the reservations for thomsol ves they could have supported themselves. The evils consequent on this leasing 1 tho Indians lands and the fencing of the publio lands, Mr. Dawes contin ued, imposed u grave duty on Congress. If remedial action were not taken in time, tho public domain would pass irrevocably Into the possession ot largo 1-nd owners, lorcign and nntive. Congress had power to clothe the ex ecutive olhcoi-s of the government with ample authority in the premises and should do so. Mr. Confer ot Michigan hoped the resolu tion would he sufficiently comprehensive to af ford full protection to the Indians, and In or der to afford time for preliminary examination and consideration ho desired the matter to go ovor lor one day.

Mr. Long of Mass., another member of the committee, said that legislation on the subject of interstate transportation wns desirablo and needed. The only way to meat this evil was to adopt certain remedial statutes, but instead of leaving them to rust on tlie statute-books, to establish for their automat io operation an interstate com mission which should have a close, constant nnd immediate supervision of interstate com merce. Tho matter then went over. Mr. Morrison of 111. introduced this bill rela tive to the surplus revenue: "Be it enio ed, etc., that tho secretary of the treasury be and is hereby authorized and directed to apply tho surplus revenue at any time in tho treasury in excess of $100,000,000 not otherwise appro priated to the redemption of United State! bonds, nnd when any ot said bonds are redeem, able at the pleasure of the government it shall not be la-ful to apply any portion of faid surplus to the purchase of bonds at a pre mium."
