FORTY-TWO SENATORS PRESENT. The Second Half of the Fiftieth Concress Opens Today. Rjteclt) to the DIAVATCW* WASHINGTON, gress assembled for its second and final session at noon today. Long before that hour the galleries be?an to fill and by 11-30 all but the diplomatic and executive galler ies were crowded. The executive gallery was empty. On the floor pages were distributing baskets ot flowers. The largest decorated the desk of the presiding officer. There were two baskets ou Senator Beck's desk, one on Senator Blodgett's, one on Mr. Pugh's and one on Mr. Daniel's. Not a bud or blossom adorned the desks of the republican senators. Mr. Stewart, of Nevada, was the first member of the senate to make an appear ance on the floor. Ho was soon joined by Mr. Chandler, Mr. Hawley and Mr. Dolph. A few minutes later Mr. Spooner, Mr. Aldrich, Mr. Mandorson, Mr. Frye and Mr. Morrill came in at the left of the cloak room and joined their colleagues on the floor. At the same time Mr. Harris, ot Tennessee, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, appeared on the democratic side of the chamber. As the hands of the big senate clock moved on to the meridian mark, the chamber rapidly tilled with members, and a general handshaking was going on in all of the aisles. At 13 o'clock Senator Ingalls entered the chamber escort ing the chaplain, Mr. Butler. When the gavel descended there were forty-two sen ators present. Mr. Butler's prayer was brief. He asked for a blessing ou the presi dent aud the presideut elect. At the conclusion of the prayer, Mr. Ingalls announced the senate in session. Mr. Sherman asked if it was cus tomary to call the roll. Mr. Ingalls said it was not. Mr. Sherman then offered a reso lution instructing the secretary of the house that the senate was ready for the transfer of business. The resolution was adopted. The resolution offered by Mr. Morrill, and adopted, the president pro tern, appointed Mr. Morrill and Mr. Saulsbury a committee to notify the president. A reso lution offered by Mr. Cameron was adopted, making the regular hour for assembling 12 o'clock. The senate then went into informal re cess to await the president's message. At the conclusion of the recess, the usual message from the house, am juncing the fact of its being in session, and of its having appointed a committee to wait upon tlio president, was delivered, it having been delayed in conse quence of the recess. That was followed by a report from the committee to wait upou the president to the effect that it had performed that duty, and that the presideut would cominuuicato in writing immediately. And then the president's message was delivered by Mr. l*ruden, one of his secretaries, and Mr. Mc Cook, the secretary of Uie senate, pro ceeded to read it. 

SCENES I.N THE HOUSE. Hppcial to the DtvPArc* WASHINGTON- before Speaker Carlisle at 13 o'clock today struck his desk with a brand new gravel and called the house to order, a scene was presented on the floor which was highly noisy and mirthful. The desks of the members were nearly all occupied and each man talked to the other in a loud tono of voice, explaining election iucidents and accidents, 'j hero was much handshaking. When Mr. Itandall, looking fairly well, entered aud took his seat, a few minutes before 12 o'clock, ho was im mediately surrounded and heartily con gratulated upon his convalescence. A splendid tloral ottering stood upon his desk, 'ihero were buskols of flowers upon the desks of the speaker and Messrs. Springer, Weaver, Mills, Sayers, Richardson and others. Mrs. Cleveland and her mother, Mrs. Folsom, occupied the front seat of the diplomatic gallery. The president's wife wore a tan-colored clot!) suit and a dark brown plush hat. The other galleries were tilled to overflow ing. Atter the blind chaplain, the Rev. Dr. Milburn, had offered supplication and the reading clerk began to call the roll of the house, the members recommenced their chatter, continuing it while the secretary of the senate read the announcement that the upper body of congress had reassembled, was ready tor business and had appointed a committee to act with a similar committee on the part of the house to wait upou and notify the president that congress awaited his pleasure. The house then took a recess at 1:30. After the recess Mr. Holman announced that the committee appointed to wait upon the presideut had performed that duty, and that the president would communicate with the congress forthwith. Mr. Pruden, one of the president's secre taries, was then announced, and the annual message was delivered to the house and immediately read by the clerk. 

TIIE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Congress of tho United States: As you assemble for tlie discharge of the duties you have assumed as the representatives of a free and generous people, your meeting is marked by an interesting and impressive inci dent. With the expiration of the present ses sion of the congress the first century of your constitutional existence as a nation will be completed. Our survival for 1(10 years is not sufficient to assure us that we no longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance, with all its promised blessings, of a government founded upon the freedom of the people. The time rather ad monishes us to soberly inquire whether in the past we have always kept in the course of safety, or whether we have before us a wry plain and clear which leads to happiness and perpetuity. When the experiment of our government was undertaken the charter adopted forourguid ance was the constitution and departure from the lines laid down. It is only by a strict ad herence to the direction they indicate and by restraint within the limitations they lixed that we can furnish proof to the world ot'tho fitness of the American people lor self government. The equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlying principle of our institutions should not be confined to tile relations of our citizens to each other. The government itself is under bond to the American people, that in the exercise of its functions and powers it will deal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously honest and fair, and absolutely just. It has agreed that American citizenship shall be the only credential necessary to justify the claim of equality before the law, and that no condition lu life shall give rise to discrimina tion in the treatment of the opposite by the government. The citizens of our republic in its early day rigidly insisted upon full compliance with the letter of this bond, and saw stretching out be fore him a clear field for individual endeavor, and his tribute to the support of his govern ment was measured by the costs of its econom ical maintenance, and he was secure in the en joyment of the remaining recompens3 ot his steady and contented lot. In these days the frugality of the people was stamped upon their government and was enforced by tbe free, thoughtful and intelligent suffrage of the cit izetis. Combinations, tnonoplies and aggre galions of capital were either avoided or sternly regulated and restrained. The pomp and glitter of government less free ottered no temptation and presented no delusion to the plain people, who side by side in friendly competition, wrought for the ennoblement and dignity of man for the solution of the problem of free government and for the achievement of the grand destiny awaiting the land which God has given them. A century has passed. Our cities are the abiding places of wealth and lux ury our manufacturers yield foriunes never dreamed of by the fathers of the republic: our business men are madly striving in the race for riches and immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination of their undertakings. We view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity. While only a closerscrutiny devel ops a somber shading upon more careful in spection we find the wealth and luxury of our cnies mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unrernunerative toil. A crowded and constantly increasing urban population suggests the impoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's simple and laborious life, joins the larger chase for easily acquired wealth. 

FORMATION OK CLASSES. We discover that the foriunes realized by our manufacturers lire no longer solely by reward of Dec. 3.—The Fiftieth con­ sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that, they result from the discriminating favor of the government, and are largely built upon undue exaction from the masses of our people. The gulf between employers and the employed is constantly widening and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very- rich and powerful, while in another are found the toiling poor. As we view the achievement of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations and monopolies, while tho citizen is struggling for in the rear, or is trampled to day beneath an iron heel. Corporations which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters. Still, congratu lating ourselves upon the wealth and pros perity of our country, and eoinpla ccutly contemplating every incident of change inseparable from these conditions, it Is our duty as patriotic citizens to inquire at the present stage of our progress how the bond of tho government made •with the people has been kept and performed. Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from •ur citizens to the necessities of its economical administration. The government persists in exacting from the substance of the people millions, which unapplied and useless, lie dor mant lu its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation add to extortion. The danger attending the diversion of tho currency of the country from the legit imate channels of business under the same laws by which these results arc produced, the government permits many millions more to be added to the cost of tho living of our people and to be taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority. 

GOVERNMENTAL FAVORITISM. The government, under pretext of an exer olseof its taxing power, enters gratuitously Into partnership with these favorites to their advantage and IO the injury of a vast majority of our people. This is not equality before the law. The grievances of those not included within the circle of these benetlcieries, when fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and dis oontcnt. Our farmers, long suffering and pa tient, struggling in the race of life with the hardest and most unremitting toil, will not fail to see, in spile of misrepresentations and misleading fallacies, that they are obliged to accept such prices for their products as are fixed in foreign markets where they compete with the fanners of the world. That their lands are declining in value, while their debts increase, and that without compensating favor they are forced by the action of tho govern ment to pay for the benefit of others, such en hanced prices for the things they ueed that the scanty returns of their labor fail to furnish their support or leave no margin tor accumula tion. Our to workingmen, enfranchised from all de­ lusions. that their families. Tin: PENSION VETOES Claims often the against the government bv proof is supplied by no better consideration than wealth of the of ihe government and the poverty claimant. Gratuities in the torm of pensions are granted upon no other real ground than the needy condition of the appli cant, or for reasons less valid, and large sums are expended and other a for purposes of public buildings improvements upon representations carefully claimed to and necessities. To the sncb be related to public needs extent, to which the consideration of matters should be pone portance. feadto subordinate and post­ action upou subjects of great public im­ but involving no special private or iartisan interest, should arrest attention and reformation. PUBLIC LANDS. Repeated recommendations have been sub mitted for the amendment and change of the U«s relating to our public lands to other uses lor homes ot hone6t settlers might be prevented. While a measure to meet this conceeded necessity of relorm remains await ing Hie action of the congress, many claims the public lands and applications for .P* donation in favor of states and ind have been allowed. A plan in aid management reQonJmended by formed as Containing furtherance of the sol'" we j[ jn ilu-nl re .it ores in ct^ Vf the iM praklem. has urns f8„• failed of legislative sanction, while greets of doubtful expediency to railroad corporations permitting them to pass through Vndiun reservations have greatly multiplied. MILITARY PRISONS. The propriety and necessity of the erection of ont^Or more prisons for tbe confinement of UniuCd States convicts and a postoitice build ing In the national capital are not disputed. but those needs yet remain unanswered, while scores of public buildings have been erected where their necessity for public pur poses is not apparent. A revision of our pension laws could easily be made which would resi upon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant. But while our general pension laws yet remain confused and imperfect, hundreds of our private pension laws are annually passed, which are the sources of unjust discrimina tiouand popular demoralization. INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. I Appropriation bills for the support of tho government are defaced by items and provis ions to meet private ends, and it is freely as serted by responsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for public in ternal improvement would fail to meet with favor unless it contained more for local and private advantage than for public benettt. These statements can be much emphasized by I an ascertainment of the proposition of fe leral legislation which either bears upon its face its private character, of which upon examination develops such a motive power. PEACE WITH ALL NATIONS. In pursuance of a constitutional provision re quiring the president from time to time to give the congress information of the states of the Union, 1 have the satisfaction to announce that the close of the year tinds the United States in the enjoyment of domestic tranquility and at peace with all the nations. Sincc my last an nual message our foreign relations have been strengthened and improved by performance of I International good offices and by new and re I newed treaties or amity, commerce and re clprocal extradition of criminals. Those international questions which still await settlement are all reasonably within the I domain on amicable notion, and there is no existing subject of dispute between the United I States and any foreign power that is not sus ceptible of satisfactory adjustment by frank diplomatic treatment. The questions between tho United Steles and Great Britain relating to the rights of I 

AMERICAN WORKINGMEN under treaty and international comity in the terrilor.a. waters of Canada and New England, I 1 regret io say are not satisfactorily adjusted. THE ALASKA BOUNDARY. The coastal boundary between our Alaskan possessions nnd British Ccl'.rabia. I regret to say, has not received the attention demanded by its importance, and which, on several occa sions heretofore. I have had the honor to rec ommend to the congress. The admitted im practicability, If 1 and no longer frightened by the cry- their wages are endangered bv a just re' vision of our tariiT laws, will reasonably de mand through such revision steadier employ ment, cheaper means of living in their homes, freedom for themselves and children from the doom of personal servitude, and an open door their advancement beyond the limits of a laboring class. Others of our citizens whose oomfons and expenditures are measured by moderate salaries and fixed incomes will in sist upou the the cost of fairnes^and justice of cheapening necessaries for themselves and not impossibility, of making an accurate and precise survey and demarka tion of the bounuary line, as it Is recited in the treaty with Russia, under which Alaska was ceeded to the United States, renders it abso lutely requisite for the prevention of national jurisdictional complications that adequate up propriation for a recounolsance and survey to obtain proper knowledge of the locality and the geographical features ot the boundary should be authorized by congress with as little delay as possible. RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS. It is much to be desired that some agreement should be reached with her majesty's govern ment by which tho damage to life and property on the great lakes may be alleviated by re moving or humanely regulating the obstacles to reciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded vessels. The act of June 19, 1S78. which offers I to Canadian vessels free access to our inland I waters in aid of wrecked or disabled vessels, has not yet become effective through concur I rent action by Canada. The due protection of our citizens of French origin or descent, from claim of military serv iee in the event of their returning to or visiting France, has called forth correspondence which I was laid before you at the last session In the absence of conventional agreement as to natu ralization. which is greatly to be desired this government sees no occasion to recede from the sound position it has maintained, not only with regard to France, but as to all countries with which the United States have not concluded special treaties. I Twice within the Inst year has the imperial household of Germany been visited by death, and I have hastened to express the sorrow of this people and their appreciation of the lofty character of the late aged Kmperor William and their sympathy with the heroism under suffering of his son, the late Emperor Frc-d erick. I renew my recommendation of two years ago for the passage of a bill for the re funding to certain German steamship lines of the interest upou tonnage dues illegally ex acted. In a message accompanying my approval on the first day of Octobe last, of a bill for the exclusion of Chinese laborers. I laid before congress full information, and all correspond ence touching the negotiation of the treaty with China concluded a', this capital on the I2tii day of March, 1888, and which having been con firmed by the senate with certain amendment, was rejected by the Chinese government. This message contained a recommendation that a sum of money be appropriated as compensa tion to Chinese subjects who have suffered in juries at the hands of lawless men within our jurisdiction, such appropriation having been duly found, awaits reception by the Chinese government. A COUNSULSHIP RECOMMENDED FOIt COREA. Legislative provision is hereby recommended to organize and equip consular cour'.s inCorea. Persia has established diplomatic representa tions at this capital and has evidenced very great interest in the enterprise and achieve ments of our citizens I am therefore hopeful that beneficial commercial relations between ihe two countries may be brought about. THE HAYTIAN SQUABBLE. I announce with sincere regret that Haytia has again become the theater ot insurrection, .•order and bloodshed. The titular govern ment of Prcsiueui ooioinan nas been lorciuly ovenhrowu auu uriveu out oi Ihe country to France, where he has since cued. The tenure ot power nas been so unstable amid the war of lac Lions lual ban ensued since the expulsion ot Presiueut auiomau, that no goverunicnl constituted by me win of the Uay.ian peopie fas been recognized as administering esponsiDly the unairs of that country, our representative has been instructed to ab stain uoui liiteneiaiice beiween the warring factious- auu a VtSsei of our navy has been sent to liayuau waters to sustain our minis.er, and for me protection of the persons ami pros peil.y of American citizens.

This treaty having been rejected by the senate, 1 transmitted a message to tho congress, on the 23d of August last, reviewing the transactions and submitting for consideration certain recom mendations for legislation concerning the irn pori ant questions involved. Afterward, outbe 12th of September, in response to a resolution of the senate, 1 again communicated fully all the information lu my possession as to the ac tion of the government of Can ada aflecting the commercial rela tion between the dominion and the United States, including the treatment of American fishing vessels in the ports and waters of British North America. The communications have all been published, and, therefore, opened to the knowledge of both houses of congress, although two were addressed to the senate alone. Comment upon a repetition of their contents would be superfluous, and I am not aware that anything has since occurred whicn should be added to the facts therein stated. To meet an exigency created by the rejection of the treaty I now again invoke the earnest and immediate attention of the congress to the condition of this important question as it cow stands before them and tho country, and for the settlement of which I am deeply solicitous. THE 

SACK V1LLE INCIDENT. Near the close of the month of October last occurrences of a deeply regretable nature were brought to my knowledge which made it my paintul, but imperative, duty to obtain wi'h as little delay as possible a new personal channel of diplomatic intercourse in this country with the government of Groat Britain. The correspondence in relation to this inci dent will in due course belaid before you and will disclose the unpardonable conduct ot the official referred to in his interference by advice and counsel with the suffrages of American citizens in the very crisis of the presidential election, then near at hand, and and also in his subsequent public declarations to justify his action, superadding impugnment of tho execu tive and senate of the United States ia connec tion with important questions now pending in controversy between the two governments. The otlense thus committed was most grave, involving disastrous possibilities to the good relations of the United Stales and Great Brit am, constituting a gross breach of diplomatic privilege and an invasion of the purely domes tic affairs and essential sovereignty of tho gov ernment to which the envoy was accredited. Haviug first fulfilled the just demands of International comity by affording full oppor tunity for her majesty's governmsnt to act in relief of the situation, I considered prolonga tion of discussion to be unwarranted ana there upon declined to further recognize tho diplomatic character of the person whose continuance in such function would destroy that mutual confidence which is essential to the good understanding of the two governments, and was inconsistent with the welfare and self-respect of the government of the United States. Tbe usual interchange of communication has since continued through her majesty's legation in this city. My en deavors to establish, by international co on oration, measures for the prevention of the extermination of fur seals in Beliring sea have not been relaxed, and I have hopes of being enableu shortly to submit an effective and sat isfactory conventional project with tho marl time powers for ihe approval of tho senate. tlemenl. simniur claims of our citizens will continue to be urged upon the Cniiiau cuvern ment, and. it is nopeti, will not be suojcct to luriher ticiay. Tne president announces an advantageous treaty of amuy wnh Fcru. ami thesatislaciory I settlement of claims ol American citizens against tquauor and lJenrnaiK and llayu by aruunitlou, and the extension of time Iir the l'atiucaiiou ot a treaty lora renearuig of claims against Venezuela. He advises reciprocal I commerce lreat.es with South aiui central American countries and with sail Domingo and llayu. A meeting of the maritime powers in WasUingtou ill April to devise means for the greatei s.-curlty ot life ana property at sea. is approved. A special message will be sent to congress ou ihe subject of tonnage duties. 

REVISION OF TUB NAI I.KAI.17.A11HN l.AWS. lth the rapid increase ol immigration to our shores and lite lacnities of modern travel. abuses of the generous privileges anorded by our naturalization laws cads lor their careful revision. The easy and unguarded manner in which certificates of American citizenship can now be obtained has luduceo a class, uuiortun aiely large, to avail themselves ot the oppor tunity to become absotved from allegiance to their native lands, and yet by a foreign resi dence to escape any just duty ami contribution I of service to ihe country oi their proposed I adoption. Thus, while evading tne dunes ot citizenshiplo the United states, they may I make prompt claim tor its national protection aud demauo its intervention iu their benalt. International complications ot a serious na I lure arise, uiid tne correspondence oi the slate department discloses the grent number and complexity of the questions which have been I raised. THE REORGANIZATION FOR THE CONSULAR SERVICE is a matter of serious importance to otirna tional interests. The iiunioer of existing prm cipal consular offices is benet oil to be yreaier than is at all necessary for tne conduct of the I public business. It need not be our policy to maintain more than a moderate number of principal oitices. each supported by a salary suilicieiit to enable the incumbent to live in comfort so distributed as to secure the con venient supervision through subordinate agen cies of affairs over a considerable dis.net. An emphatic indorsement is given to the I proposition for the centennial celebration ou April an, 1MB, of the inauguration of SVashing ton iu New York. NATIONAL FINANCES. The report of the secretary ol the treasury exhibits in detail the condition of our national finances and the operations of the several branches of the government related to his de partment. The lolal ordinary revenues of the government for the fiscal year ended June :W, 1SS8. amounted to of which tUiy. (Kil,17:1.04 was received from customs duties and il5!4,'J%,!t71.9o from internal revenue taxes. The total receipts from a.l sources exceeded those for the fiscal year ended June Jll. 1S«7, by r.8o2.7U7.10. The ordinary expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, lst»s, were &">!•,• bM,»5S.t)7, leaving a surplus ot 111.012,llti.irJ. The decrease in these expenditures, as com pared with the fiscal year ended June 3U. '.SfC. was Nj.27s.2-J0.au. notwithstanding the payment of more than t5.iAM UOU for pensions in excess of what was paid for that purpose iti the latter mentioned year. The revenue: of the govern ment for the year ending June 3U, lssfl, asocr tained for the quarter euded Sept. 30, 1S8S. aud estimated for the remainder of the time, amount to tSTT.UOn.W'U, and the actual and esti mated ordinary expenditures for the same year are t274,uOu.uOll, leaving an estimated surplus of I sio-i.tioo.rtiio. The estimated receipts for the year ending June 80, 18'JO. are .ia77,OtXI,(*Xi, and the estimated I ordinary expenditures for the same term are 27S,-iti7.4.SS.:-l4, showing a surplus of .T1U1,2.«, 511.60. The foregoing statements of surplus do not take into account the sum necessary to be expended to meet tbe requirements of the sink ing fund act. amounting to more thau H7,0(iu,0no annuahy. The cost of collecting the customs revenues for the last fiscal year was 2.44 per cent. For the year 1PW5 it was 3.77 per cent. The excessof internal revenue taxeseoilected during the last fiscal year over those collected for the year ended June 30. 1KM7, was $r.4s9, 174.2i. and ihe cost of collecting this revenue I decreased from 3.4 per cent in 1SH7 to less than 3.2 per cent for the last year. The tax collected on oleomargerine was S7-il94-i.OI for the year ending June 30. 1887. and 8864.139.88 for the following year. The requirements of the sinking fund act have been met for the year ended June 80. 1888. and for the current year also by the pur chase of bonds. After complying with this law, as positively required, and bonds sufficient for that purpose had been bought at a premium it was not deemed prudent to further expend the surplus in such purchases until the author ity to do so should be more explicit. A resolu lion, however, having been passed by both houses of congress, removing all doubt as to executive authority, daily PURCHASES OF IIONDP were commenced on the 23d day of April, Hts. and have continued until the present time. By this plan bonds of the government not yet due have been purchased up to and Including the 80th day of November, 18S8, amounting to SiM.7uu.4oo. the premium paid thereon amount ing to .50H.U13.0s. The premium added to the principal of these bonds represents an investment yielding about 2 per cent interest for the time they still had to run and the saving to the government repre seuted by the difference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent upon the sum paid for principal and premium and what it would have paid for interest at the rate specified in the bonds if they had run to iheirmaturity isabout i«7.1i8.UU0. At first sight this would seem to be a profitable and sensible transaction on the part of the government, but as suggested by the secretary of the treasury, the surplus thus ex pended for the purchase of bonds was money drawn from the people in excess of any actual need of the government, and was so expended rather than allow it to remain idle in the treas ury. If this surplus under the operation of just and equitable laws had been left in the hands of the people, it would have been I worth in their business at least 6 per en! per annum. Deducting from the amount i.f inter est upon the principal mid premium of these bonds for the time they had to run at tbe rate of ti per cent, the saving of2 per cent made for the peopie oy the purchase of such bunds, the loss will appeal to be 5vV.78tl,(i!iu. Notwithstanding the large sums paid out in the purchase of bonds the surplus iu ihe treas ury on the 4th day of November, isss, was ^2. 234.tilll.oi after deducting about fc.ii.iWu.iiuo just drawn out for the payment of pensions. 

SILVER COINAGE. At the close of the fiscal yeur ended June 30. IRsr. there had been coined under the compul sory silver coinage act 2i'I i.W 2-o in silver dollars. i5o,.V.P4.3M of which were in the hands oi the people. On the 30th of June. 1SS. there had been coined i-.".!fi.7iai.7l.i0, and of this ?.')f. 829.303 was in circulation in coin, and KiXi, 387,37ti in sliver certificates, for the redemption of which silver dollars to that amount were held by tbe government. On the 30th day of Nov. 1888. $312,570,990 had been coined, *00,970,990 of the silver dollars were actually in circulation, and $237,418,340 in certificates. The secretary recommends the suspension of the further coinage of silver, and in sucit recommendation I earnestly concur. For further valuable information unci timely re commendations 1 ask the careful attention of congress lo the secretary's report GltLM VISAGKD WAR. The secretary of war reports that the army on the date of the last consolidated returns consisted of 2.189 oUiccrs and 24.M9 enlisted men. The actual expenditures of the war de partment for the fiscal year ended June 80. 18«8, amounted #41.'.t:, lo7.u7. of which sum in.l5S.51ii.U3 was expended for public works, in cluding river and harbor improvements, "The board of ordinance and formication." provided for under ihe act approved Sept. 22, last, was convened Oct. 30, 188!. and plans and specifications for procuring forgings for 8, IU and 12-incb guns under provision of section 4, and also tor procuring 12 inch breech-loading mortors. cast iron, hooped wuh steel, under the provisions ot section 5 of the said act. were 1 I duly mude on the tfih uay of .November. l»8r, of the conventional extension of the treaty ot Juned, 1OI5, with Hawaii, under which rela tions of such special and oeneucent intercourse have been created. I OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. In the vast neiu of oriental commerce now unlolued from our Pacinc borders no tealure presents stronger recommendations tor con gressional action than tne establishment of communication by submarine Leiegruph with Honolulu. Tne geograpmcal position of Uie Hawaiian group, in reiauon to our Pacific I stales, creates a natural in.erdepeuueticy aud mutuality of interest which our present treat ies tvere inieuuea to foster, and which mane I ciose communication a logical aud modern no cessity.
