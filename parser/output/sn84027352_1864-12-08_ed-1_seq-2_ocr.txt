But while the Union party have the res ponsibility of the conduct of public affair. for the next four years, and while they havi no rieht and no disposition to shirk that res ponsibility, they have a right to expect all factious opposition on the part of the oppo sition, heretofore justified by the exigences and demands of politics, to cease. There would, indeed, seem to be no justifiable mo tive on the part of the opposition, to do otherwise. The politics of the country are settled for fom years.

HEBALD Orrici, OSKALOOAA, TOWA, Dec. 3d,« p. Tlie following are tha particulars of the tragedy which occurred an hour or two ago. A man calling himself George Jackson, from Springfield, Ills, knocked down Francis Hodge, and rob»ed him of his pocket-book. Some accounts say they had been drinking together previously—both were apparently very mueh under the influence of liquor.— Deputy Sheriff G. W. Norton was notified of the robbery and attempted to arrest Jack son, who drew a revolver and shot Mr. Nor ton in the right jaw. This occurred near the jail. Jackson ran and a number of men after him. He ran up near the Christian church—on the way shooting at Mr. Sweeny who was driving along the streot. Albert Witter, a young man 18 years o^ age, son of widow Witter who recently set tled here, was chopoing wood in an alley, and the men in pursuit cried out to him to stop Jackson who was then near him. Be fore Witter had time to comprehend what was wanted of him, Jackson shot him, the ball entering the right temple and going in to the brain. Jackson was soon surrounded, arrested, and lodged in jail. Before he gave up he was wounded pretty severely in the head. M.. Norton's wound though painful, is not thought to be dangerous. Witter, though insensible for a time, was when we saw him, abfe to talk. His wound had not been thoroughly ?rammed, but the bad «p peared to have lodged in tha front part of the brain. His physician is of the opinion the wrund wi'l proye fatal. Jackson's pistol was a small revolver. He had also on his peraan a rmalt dirk knife. Th« El«cl«ral College.

On the 10th the passengers embarked on the Salvador as usual with their baggage. Immediately on going aboard they were tak en into the main saloon, ostensibly to have their tickets examined.

The Lancaster returned to Panama with the prisoners. Before reaching Panatria the leader of the pirates made a full confession. Ths names of the pirates are T. E. Hogg, of Bal imore, Captain E. A.

Hogg was recently captured in the Tris tam Shanty while running the blockade off Wilmington. His instructions from Mallony show he has a rebel commission and sailed from Wilmington for Havanna, where he made up his gang. They have confederates all along the coast who were to join them.
