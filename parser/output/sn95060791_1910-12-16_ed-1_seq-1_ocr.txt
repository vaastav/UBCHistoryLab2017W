Both men we consider socialists of the most extreme type. But Mr. Cunniff 's defense of Senator J. W. Bailey of Texas was magnificent and was highly creditable to" Mr. Cunniff as a man and a member of this convention. Senator Bailey is the leader of the democrats in the senate, and is admittedly the ablest man in either branch of congress, arid the best friend Arizona ever had in tne upper orancn 01 congress is Senator Bailey of lexas" The tirade of the man from Co chise county against that peer less leader of the democracy in the senate vas very unwise and ill-timed. There are several thousand Texans in Maricopa county who love Joe Bailey, as ihey call him, and " will resent with vigor the bombastic utter ances of Parsons. Arid, if we don't miss our guess, it will cost the constitution hundreds of votes m this territory. When the battle for statehood was on in the senate, it was Senator Bailey who kad the bat tle for admission; and he inform ed Aldnch and Hale that the tariff bill should never reach a vote till Arizona was given an opportunity in the senate; and it was due to this defy .that the senate called the enabliug act up and passed it. Yet, in the face of this so-call ed democratic convention abus ing the gentleman for replying to a telegram when he was re- requested so to do by two reput able democrats of the constitu tional convention. is the great quality of forcing the cards to be played above the board. It would be far better, of course, to have another man than Mr. Ballinger in charge of the people's interests in Alaska; but it is a fine thing to have a condition in which an official who has a wrong conception of the square deal has got to administer the square deal anyhow, i. For which, thanks be to Mr. Gtavis, Mr. Pinchot, Mr. Brandéis and Collier's Weekly. Snow fell during the last week, saving the wheat crop, and thus amazing many persons who did not imagine such a thing was possible after a Democratic victory. . A. & B. SCHUSTER Holbrook . St. Jobs White River There is a deal of good in the attempts to show "the mistakes of the insurgents." Every such attempt must set forth "the mistakes of the insurgents" and that is admirable. We do all kinds of job work at the NEWS office. Give us a TRIAL. I represent five good live Insurance Companies. Sidney Sapp. Fire FIFTEEN MILLION HORSE POWER. Secretary Wilson, in his annual report, says that the available water power lying within the forest reserves is approximately 15 million horse power, . only a small fraction of which has been appropriated. Is it any wonder that the special interests have been seeking to get control of this stupendous source of energy But thanks to the development and popularizing of the Roose velt and Pinchot conservation policies, this power is reasonably sure to be amply safeguarded. It is proposed that when a pri vate corporation is given the right to "harness" any of this power, the government will first "harness" the corporation. President Taft's message may mean going to prepare a shelf all of his own. 40, 000-word that he is 5-foot book 

RIGHT THROUGH PUBLICITY. You will observe that for the conservation policies publicity has done its sovereign work, even chough Mr. Ballinger con- ' tinues to freeze to his job. That Rev. E. W. Elmquist will speak on the subject "The Prophet Jonah and the Story ot the Great Fish" at the regular morning service next Sunday.
