I 'lll.-.l 3ptl?rt0iut Jisptch. *? "'?" "" s 1 ???? FRIDAY DECEMBER 14, 1877. The Conkling Triumplk The triumph ot Senator Cokklbso over the President in the executive session of Wednesday was a triumph of a set of con spirators over tbo proper authority of the President and over justice. Senator Bay ard, whojw sentiments and views generally have the ring: of the true metal, struck the exact key when he maintained the right of the Executive to make changes which in his opinion would be for the benefit of the public service, be being responsible for the enforcement of the laws, and entitled to select his agents. Exactly the truth and justice of tbe matter. Where on earth is maintained tbe principle that a cliief of ad ministration shall have no control over bis subalterns, and no rigbt to remove them ? It is the very esscnce of conspiracy in the Senate that inspires the intervention of that body between the Chief Magistrate and the officers under him. What sort of relations can now exist between the restored men and the head of the Government ? The Conklingism of the Senate is alien to the efficiency. and dignity of the Administra tion. But what shall we say of tbe Democrats of tbe Senate who joined the rancorous partisans in this vindictive act ? That they misrepresented their constituents we are sure; but why should they have gone against the best friend to justice, the Con stitution. and State equality and national peace, who ever belonged to the Republican party f Why should they, at tbe very mo ment of exhibiting their ingratitude to President Hates, have committed an out rage upon public order and an assault upon tbe measure of civil reform, which is based upon tbe purest and most patriotic princi ples ? We have never known an act more perfectly indefensible than this of the four I Democratic senators in becoming recruits of the vainest and bitterest of Republican senators, Mr. Coxkling. What is the matter with tbe Maryland senators? What means the senator "from I Texas? A "norther" blows from ibe North. Surely in this ease tbe "norther" I has become the "sou-easter" and blown the Texas senator plumb into Maine I As lor Senator Eatox, we never expected any thing of him, and we are not likely to be disappointed. He was far too strong in opinions and professed sentiments which, for one, we neither expected nor desired any friend of the South at the North to enter tain. He did us of the South harm by his extravagance. We suspected him of being a quasi-madman or aquasi something else. We know that we could not avoid quoting Axdrew Johxsox upou him? thus: "Damn a man -who is more for me than I am for myself." These gentlemen have committed an act that looks like treachery to the best interests of the nation and the order and dignity of the National Administration. Committed by Democrats, as they are, it is an act in juriousto their own party as well as per fidious to tbe cause of justice. President Hates is tbe first President of the United States who has given us civil service reform in a practical manner. It is lamentable to say that tbe heaviest blow that has fallen upon this measure has received its decisive weight from the party that has pub licly approved and sustained the measure itself. This was said with regard to Beast Butler, who, at the Convention to nomi nate a candidate for President in 1860, voted, we believe, fifty-nine times for Jeff. Davis. We feel sure that the President will ulti mately triumph over the vindictiveness and the untiring strategies of the greedy office hunters and sorehead aspirantf to tbe pre sidency. This very proceeding will more tban likely arouse in the minds of true men, both Republicans and Democrats, a proper sense of the danger before them and the ne cessity of warding it off. The Two Kinds of Taxes. The ultra agitators about the public debt have taken the ground that the inability of Virginia to pay was owing to the heavy taxation imposed upon her by the Federal Government. "We deemed it, therefore, fair to charge upon them, in an article in yes terday's Dispatch , that they shrank from attacking the Federal Government while making the most rude assaults upon the State's creditors. This was, we said, in the language of Governor Kemper, showing a spirit that shrinks from an encounter with the strong and tramples on the jveak." But it will be remembered by many of onr readers that when the leaders who at tempted to excuse Virginia for her alleged disability on the ground of being overbur tbened by Federal taxation made their ar-* guments on the subject they were an ; swered by the Dispatch , which showed that the tobacco tax did not in any manner im pair the wealth of Virginia; that every dol lar ol tbe tax was paid by the consumer, . $pd that not only was the tax returned to the original payer, but it was returned with a profit which was assessed upon it in accordance with commercial customs, which are as regularly observed as though required by. law. The answer was com plete. Nevertheless, as the gentlemen claimed that tbe Federal tax was the way in which Virginia was crippled, it is fair that they should be censured for a want of independence and boldness in not attacking this Federal tax while they were so brave ? uay, ferocious? in bulldozing arid vitupe rating tbe bondholder. It is but Just to turn tbeir own guns upon themselves. But we say that there was nothing in their argument. The Federal tobacco tax does not impair tbe pecuniary ability of Virginia at all. . And it was as fallacious to assume that it did as It was to assume tbat Virginia was disabled. This is tbe point where tbe great error lies, and it Is the point of attempted Justification for. all the hullabaloo raised by gentlemen who seek to impress the public mind with the Idea, first, tbat tbe bondholders are per sona that deserve the public contempt; J and, second, that tbeir claims ought to be paid without increasing tbe public burthens. They ignore the idea that , the money loaned by tbe bondholders was loaned to build tbe public works that are now in our possession and hourly serving the public interests and convenience: They would take tbe money of the creditor and enjoy the benefits tbat flow from its expen diture, and turn bim off, as would a debtor ..of rude manners and blunted sensibilities, : "With a rebuke for being so pressing, and with tbe assurance that payment would be /made at leisure and when it was conve nient ! . #\ ?, f lAy Now, we have never believed that Virginia couldn't, pay, < .JThe that she * Wflsan assertion grow* as a moun tain . V irginia ' could pay and 'the can pay, and nothing will prevent her from paying savo tf?? dc*tn5ctlv*-dcmag0gutsm which invented the brazen etouae tbfttBho couldn't; Virginia Is improving. It was never im agined that anlncrtease of taxes beyond fif toen cento on tbe hundred dollars' value of land was required to meet ber obligations. And that after the many reassessments tbafc reducetTlhe estimated vaTue oT 'properly* and after tbe kuown fraud yearly practiced by tax-payer* of paying only a third of the personal tax which should be paid. The Moflfettreeister revenue, and the money to be eaved by biennial sessions, and tbe retrenchments that all agree should be made, will put the treasury in a condition to meet all the publfc obligations with en tire ease. VFe appeal to the representatives of tbe people to stop the agitation which is disturbing tbe public peace, impairing the public credit, and injuring the business of tbe community. All that is wanted is straight-forward legislation, with that earn est and honest devotion to the public good which is sure to preservoihe public welfare and the public honor: Forcible Re adjusters. Tbi9 term is indefinable in any way that purges it of heresy in principle. It means the adjustment of a debt by the debtor, to which adjustment the creditor must per \ force submit. Is not that violative of prin ciple, of Justice, of honor ? Is it anything else than a repudiation of whatever amount less than the whole debt the debtor may re fuse to pay > Can any one deny It? If the debtor is willing to pay the creditor his demand, then "forcible adjustment" would be an absurdity, without use and without meaning as coming from the debtor party. Or even if 'tbe adjustment met the vol untary consent of the creditor the adjective would be idle and vulgar. Its very employ ment by the debtor shows ' not only that he is dishonest enough to dictate terms for the settlement of his debt that he knows thecre ditor will not accept, buthe, tbe debtor, feels that he has tbe power to compel him to sub mission. Therefore we think that any con siderable number of gentlemen should be found in Virginia to adopt such a name as ?'forcible rekdjuster". is a shame to the public reputation of the Commonwealth. Another Caucus. Some of the prominent members of the Legislature have called a meeting of mem bers of the Legislature who belong to the Conservative party, excluding Radicals and Independents, to consult and determine upon measures with regard to the public debt that may be deemed proper. The meeting is to take place this evening at 7:30 in the Hall of the House of Delegates. The call is addressed to those who have been elected as nominees of the Conservative party, and those who have been elected as Conservatives by Conservative voters in counties and citics where there were no nominations by the Conservative party. Evidently the object is to recur to the Conservative party? to call it into the field? relyiug upon its action as a safe way to bring the State out of its present embarrass ment. Certainly the Conservative party has delivered Virginia from one of the most perillous conditions in which it ever was placed. The movers, thinking that the present peril is calculated to arouse a great deal of public devotion, and that from the nature and origin of the Conservative party there is every reason to hope that it will proceed to consider the condition of the State unshackled by that personal entangle ment, that scheming for the promotion of the ambition of unworthy partisans which so complicates legislative action in these times, have made this call upon the Conservative party. ...J As the movement of to-night, will there fore be wholly devoted to the public wel fare, we feel that it. will, as it certainly should, be largely attended, and that it will be able to make a demonstration in the right direction. ? 1. ? . A Venerable Mason.? Mr- James Evans, although in his seventy-eighth year, still fills the office of Grand Lecturer of the Grand Lodge of Virginia, having been re elected to that office at the session Tuesday night. In 1850 Mr. Evans was elected Grand Master, a position- held by many of Virginia's most illustrious patriots and statesmen, and since that time has been re elected to the office of Grand Lecturer about twenty times, as the Grand Lodge reports show. There are only two Past Grand Masters living older than Mr. Evans. They are Dr. John K. Purdie, of Isle of Wight, and. Hon. Sidney S. Baxter, ex-At torney-General of Virginia.? State. Grand lecturers are not elected ; but that is notimportant. This venerable and highly respected gentleman is the greatest lumi nary in . the craft. He- handles the pen as well as the tongue.

Mr. Daniel said at the proper time he would offer a resolution whether or not it is within the power of the General Assem bly, under section 7 of article 10 of the Constitution, to issue and negotiate to others than .the present creditors of the State new bonds for loans of funds to be applied to the redemption of the State debt. Mr. Phlegar suggested that Mr. Grims let amend his motion so as to request the Financc Committee to repprt by the 5th of January. Mr. Hurt of Pittsylvania moved to lay the subject on the table until to-morrow at 1 o'clock. I Mr. Quesenberrt deprecated the waste of time in the discussion. He thought that each senator could have referred to the Finance Committee his views in the shape of resolutions, and the Financc Committee could digest them all, and at their leisure report to the Senate. Tlje motion to postpone until to-morrow was agreed to. Mr. Daniel now presented his proposi tion ; which was referred to the Committee for Courts of Justice. THE CANAL BILL, AGAIN?

M., and that it was approved a few minutes thereafter. James L. Kemper. Mr. Hurt or Pittsylvania moved that a special committee be appointed to investi gate the matter. He felt it bis duty to do so. Mr. Johnson thought the motion of Mr. Hurt was an unnecessary reflection upon the Governor. He explained the mode of transmitting bills to the Executive, and thought that there was no occasion for the proposed action. : ?' Mr. Chiles favored the adoption of the resolution. Mr. Masset said that he thought a perfect knowledge of all the facts would exonerate every one from blame in the matter ; but as a discussion has arisen in regard to the mat ter, he thought the most satisfactory way to get at the facts would be to have the com mittee and an investigation. Mr. Hurt modified bis motion so as to lay the communication on the table until to-morrow, by which time he could prepare a resolution to cover the case; FROM THE SECOND AUDITOR. The Chair laid before the Senate a com munication from the Second Auditor, in re sponse to a resolution ; which was laid on the table and ordered to be printed.
