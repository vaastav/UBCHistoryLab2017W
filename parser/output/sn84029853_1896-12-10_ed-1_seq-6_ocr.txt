The following is the president's message to congress: To the Congress of the United States: As representative of the people in the legisla tive branch of their government you have assembled at a time when the strength and t-xcellencc of our free institutions and the litne.ss of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension and creating aggressiveness .so intense as to ap proach bitterness and passion, has been waged -throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suf frage, v.ithout disturbance of our tran quility or the least sign of weakness in our national structure. When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions we dis cover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of countrjmcn to abide by every Terdict of the popular will and to be con trolled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their government. Thus our peo ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en titles them to demand of those who under take to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service ia their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appre ciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites. In obedience to a constitutional require ment, I herein submit to the Congress cer tain information concerning national af fairs, with the suggestion of such legislation as in my judgment is necessary and expe dient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration, I shall omit many details con cerning matters within federal control, which, though by no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in depart mental reports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a minute recital of many minor incidents connected with our foreign relations which have here tofore found a place in executive messages, but are now contained in a report of the Secretary of State. ::-li is herewith submitted. At the outset of a reference to the msts important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers, it would afford me sat . isfaction If I could assure the Congress that the disturbed condition In Asiatic Turkey had during the past, year assumed a less hideous and blood- aspect, and that either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demands of humane civilization or as the result of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to interfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mere bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softened disposition or protective intervention, we cave "been afflicted by continued and not un f requcnt reports of the wanton destruction of home and the bloody butchery of men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. "While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future is by no means assured. Our government at home and our minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries In Ottoman terri tory, who constitute nearly all the Individ uals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of Amer ican citizenship. Our efforts in this direction will not be re laxed, but the deep feeling and sympathy that have been aroused among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as to lead them to demand impos sible things. The outbreaks of blind fury which led to murder and pillage in Turkev occur suddenly and without notice, and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence there as might be effective for pre vention or protection would not only be re sisted by the Ottoman government but would be regarded as an interruption of their plans to the great nations who assert their exclusive right to intervene in their own time and method for the securltv of life and property In Turkey. Several naval vessels are stationed In the Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We have claims against the Turkish government for the pillage and destruction of missionary property at Har pool and Marash during uprisings at those places. Thus far the validity of these de mands has not been admitted through our minister. Prior to such outrages and in an ticipation of danger we demanded protection for the persons and property of our mission ary citizens in the localities mentioned, and notwithstanding that evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers In the work of destruction and robberv. The facta as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt set tlement A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports, an -order has lately been obtained from the Turkish gov ernment permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that hereafter no obstacle wiU be In terposed to prevent the escape of ail those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish dominions. Oar recently appointed consul to Erzeroum is at his post and discharging the duties of his office, though for some unaccountable reason his formal exequator from the Sultan has not beea Issued, I do not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christ endom. It so mars the human and enlight ened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that it seems hardly .possible that the earnest demand of good people throughout the Christian world loc Its corrective treatment will remain un answered.

If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all considerable towns, the in surgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland country. If the de termination of Spain to put down the insur rection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time, and is evidenced by her un hesitating devotion of largely Increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insur gents have gained in point of numbers and character and resources, and are none the less inflexiblein their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the great pro jects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an Independent state Indeed, as the contest has gone on. the nretense that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it has been practically abandoned. Spain docs keep on foot such a govern ment more or less imperfectly. In the large towns and their immediate suburbs. But that exception being made, the entire coun try i3 either given over to anarchy or is subject to the military occupation of one or the other party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority that at the demand of the commander-in-chief of the Insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise its Junctions, leaving that government conies sedly (what there is the best reason for sup posing it always to have been to fact) a gov ernment merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open, or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and the immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline and equipment could hardly fall to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose its own ground, that from the nature of the country is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from am buscade and when all the advantages of po sition and numbers are on its side. In a country where all that Is indispensible to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtainable especially by those born and bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be pro longed. Meanwhile as in all cases of pro tracted civil strife, the passions of the com batants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides are more frequent and more deplorable. They also are participated in hy bands of marauders, who, now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other, as may best suit the occasion, harass the coun try at will and plunder its wretched inhab itants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruction of property even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable. But while such "seemed to be the original policy of the Span ish government it has now apparently abani'rned it and is acting upon the same theory as the insurgents, namely that the exigencies of the contest require the whole sale annihilation of property, that it may not prove of use and advantage to the ene my. It is to the same end that in pursuance of general orders, Spanish garrisons arc now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of the island is fast dimin ishing and that'unless there is a speedy and radical change in existing conditions, it will soon disappear altogether. That value con sists very largelj-, of course, in its capacity to produce sugars a capacity already much reduced by interruptions to tillage which have taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should these in terruptions continue during the current year, and practically extend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar producing territory of the island, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt The spectacle of the utter ruin of an ad joining country by nature, one of the most fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious attention of the govern ment and people of the United States under any circumstances. In point of fact they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our country. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from 830.000,000 to S50.000.00 of capital is invested in plantations, in rail road, mining and other business enter prises on the Island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in 1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose In 1893 to about J103.000.000. and in 1894. the year before present insurrection broke out, amounted to nearly $90,000,000. Be sides this large pecuniary interest staked in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself Inextricably involved in the present contest in other ways both vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside In this countrv. and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press by public meetings, by the pur chase and shipment of arms, by the raising oixunus. ana oy otner means which the spirit of our Institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the sub ject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and In all their feel ings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States, a proceeding resorted to with a view to pos sible protection by this government and not unnaturally regarded with much indig nation by the country of their origin. The insurgents are undoubtedlv encouraged and supported by the widespread sympathy of the people of this countrv always Instinct ively felt for every struggle for better and freer government and which in the case of the more adventurous and restless elements of our population, leads in only too many instances to active and personal participa tion in the contest The result is that this government is con stantly called upon to protect American cit izens, to claim damages for injuries to per sons and property, now estimated at many millions of dollars, and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts ot Spanish offi cials whose zeal for the repression of rebel lion sentiments blinds them to the immun ities belonging to the unoffending citizens ofa friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States is compelled to actively police a long line of sea coast against unlawful ex peditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not alwavs suffice to prevent These inevitable entanglements ot the United States vrith the'rebelllon in Cuba, the large American property. interests af fected and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general, have led to a ve hement demand in various quarters for some sort of positive Intervention on the part of the United! States It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should be accorded to the insurgents, a proposition no longer urged because untimely and in prac tical operation clearlyperilousand injurious to our ownJnterests. it has-since.heen and is now sometimes contended that the inde pendence of the insurgents should be recoe staed, tut imperfect or restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be. soother exists there, unless tt. jh - .T? military officer In temporary command oT a 1 , ...... uwuiii. b oe signified as a species of government.

V.WU.U k uciiucr urge in its pro portlonsaor doubtful to its tone. The cor. rectaess, of this forecast iie4 be neither tmrmed nor denied. The Unite States has crerthetess a character to itotsto .- . TO.... v I ' 5 nation, which pUtoly dictates that right and might should be the nue oi its conauct Further, though the United States is not a nation to which peace is a necessity, it is, in truth, the most pacific of powers and desires nothing so much as to live at amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified domains satisfy all possible longings for ter ritory, preclude all dreams of conques and prevent the casting of any covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, however attract ive. That our conduct towards Spain and her dominions has constituted no exception to this national disposition is made manVest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the present insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising atTarainl868. No other great power, it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same restraint and the same patient en durance. It may also be said that this distent at titude of the United States Cw s Spain in connection with Cuba will .unquestionably evince no slight respect atrh regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They in truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the Western hemis phere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fall to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor. They view with wonder and admira lionthe cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an enormous debt accum ulated, that the costly position of the genof, the Antilles may still hold its place In the Spanish crown. And yet neither the govern ment nor the people of the United States have shut their eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have failed to realize the exist ence of conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the authority of Spain, grievances recognized by the Queen Regent and by the Cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish statesmen, without regard to party, remon strated by reforms proposed by the execu tive and approved by the legislative branch of the Spanish government It is in the assumed temper and disposi tion of the Spanish government to remedy these grievances, fortified by indications of influential public opinion in Spain, that this government has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife, with honor and advan tage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects of the insurrec tion. It would seem that if Spain would offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sover eirnity of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, there should be no just reason why the pacifica tion of the island might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be in the true Interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless for whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep in tact the possessions of Spain without touch ing her honor, which will be consulted rather than Impugned by the adequate re dress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its inhabitants within their own control, without severing the natural an3 ancien ties which bind them to the mother 'tuntry, and would yet enable them to test i ir ca pacity for self government under the most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms. On the other side, that promised autonomy, however liberal, is insufficient because without assurance of the promise being ful filled. But the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain, of unconditional surrender on the part of the Insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is conceded is not altogether ap parent It ignores important features of the situation the stability two years' dura tion has given to the insurrection; the feas ibility of its prolongation in the nature of things, and as shown by past experience the utter and imminent ruin of theisland.unlcss the present strife is speedily composed; above all, the rank abuses which all parties In Spain, all branches of her government and all her leading public men concede to exist and profess a desire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to withold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demand ing them put themselves at mercy by throw ing down their arms, has the appearance of neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro fessed willingness to grant reforms. The objection on behalf of the insurgents that promised reform canot be relied upon must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume, and no reason for assum ing, that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac cording to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking. Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of the weaker of two combatants are always natural and not always unjustifiable, being sincerely de sirous in the interest of both as well as on its own account, that the Cuban problem should be solved with the least possible de lay, it was intimated by this government to the government of Spain some months ago that if a satisfactory measure of Irbme rule were tendered the Cuban Insurgents, and would be accepted by them upon a guaranty of Its execution, the United States would en deavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While no definite response to this Intimation has yet been received from the Spanish govern ment it is believed to be not altogether un welcome, while, as already suggested, no reason is perceived why it should not be ap proved by the Insurgents, neither party can fail to see the importance of early action and both must realize that to prolong the present state of things for even a short period will add enormously to the time and labor and expenditure necessary to bring about the industrial recuperation of the island. It is, therefore, fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for head ing the breach between Spain and the in surgent Cubans, upon the lines above indi cated, may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an immediate successful Issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above outlined or In any otner way consistent with our constitu tion and laws will always be at the disposal of either party. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our Interests would constrain us to obtect to the acquisition of the island or an interference with its control by any other It should be added that it cannot be-reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefi nitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due re spect to the sovereignty of Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict in all Its features and properly apprehend our Inevitable rela tions to it and its possible results without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and un precedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the conflict, either alone and in her own wav, x with our friendly co-operation.

VENEZUELA. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to ot a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States, their respect! ve'governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty be tween Great Britain and Venezuela submit ting the whole controversy to arbitration The provisions of the treaty are so emi nently just and fair that the consent of Ven ezuela thereto may confidently be antici pated. Negotiations for a treaty of general arbi tration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are far ad vanced and promise to reach a successful consummation at an early date. TREASURY DEPARTMENT. The secretary ot the treasury reports that durln0 the fiscal year ended June SO, 1896. the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to $409, 475,408.7a Dur ing the same period its expenditures were 8434,678,654.4a The excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounted to 125,203, 235.70. The ordinary expenditures during the year were 84,015.852.21 less than dur ing the preceding fiscal year. Of the re ceipts mentioned there was derived from customs the sum of 8160,021,751.67, and from internal revenue 8146,830,615.66. The receipts from customs show an Increase of $7,663,134.22 over those from the same source for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the receipts from internal revenue an Increase of $3,534,537.91. The value of our imported dutiable mer chandise during the last fiscal year was 8369,757,470, and the value of free goods imported $409,967,470, being an increase of S6,5'J,675 in the value of dutiable goods, and f 91,231,034 in the value of free goods over the preceding year. Our exports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, amounted in value to 3882,606,938, being an increase over the preceding year of 875,068.773. The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable goods imported dur ing the year was 39.94 per cent and on free and dutiable goods taken together, 20.55 per cent The cost of collecting our internal revenue was 2.78 per cent as against 2.81 per cent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. The total production of distilled spirits, ex clusive of fruit brandies, was 85,588,703 taxable gallons, being an increase of 6,639, 108 gallons over the preceding year. There was also an increase of 1,443,676 gallons of spirits, produced from fruit as compared with the preceding year. The number of barrels of beer produced was 35,859.250 as against 33,589,784 produced In the preced ing fiscal year, being an increase of 2,269, 466 barrels. OTHER DEPARTMENTS. The report of the secretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions in the several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge. The various recommendations of the secretary are indorsed. The attorney general presents a detailed and interesting statement of the important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal year. The ownership and man agement by the government of peniten tiaries for the confinement of the convictdd in United States courts of violations of federal laws, which for many years has been a subject of executive recommendation, has at last to a light extent been realized by the utilization of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary. Federal Penitentiary. This is certainly a movement in the right direction, but it ought to be at once supple mented by the rebuilding or extensive en largement of this improvised prison and the construction of at least one more, to be located in the southern states. The capacity 01 me icavenworin penitentiary Is so lim ited that the expense of its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners i,t can accommodate, does not make as economical an exhibit as it would if it were larger and better adapted to prison purposes; but I am thoroughly convinced that economy, humanity and a proper sense of responsibility and duty to wards those whom we punish for violations of federal law dictate that the federal gov- erameni snouia nave tne entire control and management of the penitentiaries where convicted violators are confined. It appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leaven worth military prison to its new uses the work previously done by prisoners confined there, and for which expensive machinery has been provided, has been discontinued. This work consisted of the manufacture of articles for army use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is exceedingly desirable that the convicts confined in this peniten tiary be allowed to resume work of this de scription. Our postofllce department Is in good condi tion and the exhibit made of its operations during the fiscil year ended June 30, 1396, if allo-vancc Is made for imperfections in the laws avolicablc to It is very satisfac tory. Ta tal receipts during the year were f 82,4?j 208.40. The total expenditures were 890,626,296.84, exclusive of SL539. 898.27 which was earned by the Pacific rail roads for transportation and credited on their debt to the government There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of 85.516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an increase of expenditures of 83,836,124.02, or 4.43 per cent The deficit was 81.679,956.19 less than that of the preceding year. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law and arc not in the control ot tne postmaster general. The deficit for the last year, although much less than that of the last and preced ing years, emphasizes the necessity for leg islation to correct the growing abuse of second-class rates, to which the deficit is mainly attributable. The transmission at the rate of one cent a pound of serial libra ries, advertising sheets, "house organs" (periodicals advertising some particular "house" or institution), sample copies and the like, ought certainly be discontinued. This subject is discussed at considerable length and reforms urgently recommended. Navy. The work of the navy department and Its present conditions are fully exhibited in the report of the secretary. The construc tion of vessels for our new navy has been energetically prosecuted by the present ad ministration upon the general lines pre viously adopted, the department having seen no necessity for radical changes In prior methods under which the work was found to be progressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has been decided, however, to provide In every ship building contract that the builder should pay all trial ex penses, and it has also been determined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. 

FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES. The condition of affairs among the five civilized tribes who occupy targe tracts of land in the Indian Territory, and who have governments of their own. has assumed such an asspect as to render it almost Indispens ible that there should be an entire change to the relations of these Indians to the gen eral government This seems to be neces sary in furtherance of their own interests ss well as for the protection of non-Indian residents In their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several recent laws is now negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment of their , .. - - .A?,.Ai (ports and the divistoa of their combos lands in severalty, and aiding laths settle ment of the troabtetoae question tribal membership. The reception of their tret proffers of negotlons was not encouraging: but through patience and such conduct-on their part as demonstrated that their Inten tions were friendly and in the Interest .of the best, prospect of success has Bo more promising. The efforts should be to save the Indians from the consequences of their own mistakes and improvidence, and to secure to the real Didiaa his rights as against intruders and professed friendswho profit by his retrogression. A change is also needed to protect lite and property through the operations of courts conducted according to strict Justice and strong enough to enforce their mandates. Vs a sincere friend of the Indian I am ex ceedingly anxious that these reforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the tribes and that no necessity may be pre sented for radical or drastic legislation. I hope, therefore, that the commission now conducting negotiations will soon be able to report that progress has been made toward a friendly adjustment of existing difficul ties. 

PACIFIC RAILROADS. On January 11, 1897. with the amount already matured, more than 113,000,000 of the principal of the subsldary bond issued by the United States in aid of the construc tion of the Union Pacific railway, including its Kansas line, and more than 86,000.000 of lit bonds, issued In aid of the Central Pa cific railroad. Including those Issued to the Western Railway, company .will have fallen due and been paid or must on that day be paid by the government Without any ref erence to the application of the sinking fund now in the treasury this will create such a default on on the part of the companies to the government as will give it the right to at once institute proceedings to foreclose its mortgage Hen. In addition to this Indebted ness which will be due January 1, 1897 , there will mature between that date and January 1, 1899 the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds which must also be met by the government These, amount to more than 820,000,000 on account of the Union Pacific lines and exceeds 821. 000,000 on ac count of the Central Pacific lines. In the case of the Union Paelfic company, the situation has become especially urgent Proceedings have been instituted to fore close a first mortgage upon those aided parts of the main lines upon which the Govern ment holds a second and subordinate mort gage lien. In consequence of these proceed ings and increasing complications, added to the default occurring on the first day of January, 1897, a condition will be presented at that date, so far as this company is con cerned that must emphasize the mandate of the act of 1887 and give to executive duty under its provisions a more imperative aspect Unless Congress shall otherwise direct or shall have previously determined upon a different solution of the problem there will hardly appear to exist any reason for delay ing beyond the date of the default above mentioned such executive action as will promise to subserve the public interests and save the government from the loss threat ened by further inaction. OFFENSIVE PARTISANSHIP. The progress made in civil service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratu lation. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well as the rancor of 'its enemies; and has gained a permanent place among the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and improve, economize and elevate the public service. There are now in the com petitive classified service upwards of 84,000 places. More than half of these have been included from time to time since March 4, 1893. A most radical and sweeping exten sion was made by executive order dated the 6th day of May, 1896. And if fourth class postmasterships are not included in the statement it may be said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil ser vice law are now classified. Abundant rea sons exist for including these postmaster ships, based upon economy, improved ser vice and the peace and quiet of neighbor hoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action at present I earnestly hope that con gress will, without increasing postofllce ap propriations, so adjust them as to permit in proper cases a consolidation of these postofflces to the end that through this pro cess tho result desired may to a limited ex tent be accomplished. The civil service rules as amended during the last year provides for a sensible and uniform method of promotion, basing elig ibility to better positions upon demon strated efficiency and faithfulness. The ahsence of fixed rules on this subject has been an infirmity in the system more and more apparent its other benefits have been better appreciated. The advantage of civil service methods In their business aspects are too well understood to require argu ment. Tneir application has become a ne cessity to the executive work of the govern ment But those who gain through the operation of these methods should be made to understand that the non-partisan scheme through which they receive their appoint ments demands from them, bv wav of re ciprocity, non-partisan and faithful per formance of duty under every administra tion, and cheerful fidelity to every chief. While they should be encouraged to de cently exercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their suffrages the political beliefs thej- honestly profess, the noisy, persistent and partisan employe, who loves political turmoil and contention, or who renders lax and grudging service to an administration not representing his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly dealt with in such a way as to furnish a warning to others who may be likewise dis posed. THE 

TARIFF LAW. I desire to recur to the statements else where made concerning the government's receipts and expenditures for the purpose ot venturing upon some suggestions touch ing our present tariff law and its operation. This statute took effect on the 2Sth day of August 1894. Whatever may be its short comings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it must bo conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater ex change of commodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a wider mar ket for our products and manufactures. The only entire year during which this law has been In force ended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In that year our imports In creased over those of the previous year more than 86,500.000, while the value of the domestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was nearly 870.000, 000 more than during the preceding ytar. Those who insist that the cost to our peo ple of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be in creased through tariff changes to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the gov ernment as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and with the additional purpose of io increasing their price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and pro ducers better and more profitable opportu aities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the government to meet the naces- jary expenses of its maintenance. Consid ered as to its sufficiency in this aspect the present law can by no means fall under just rondemnation. During the only complete lscal year of Its operation it has yielded jnly 88,000,000 more revenue than was re ceived from tariff duties in the preceding fear. There was. nevertheless, a deficit be tween our receipts and expenses of a little more than 825.000,000. This, however, was not unexpected. The situation was such on December last leven months before the close of the fiscal rear, that the secretary of the treasury foretold a deficiency of fl7.000.00a The rreat and increasing apprehension and (imlditv in business circles and the depres sion In all activities intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or operation seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise re ceived and readllv account for the differ ence between this estimate of the secretary and the actual deficiency as well as for a continued deficit. indeed, it must oe coniessea inai we conia nardlv have had a more unfavorable nerlod than the last two years for the collection of arisatonwillbe sudden, but it has act to with n isreeilse-os'aujeletnl continuance.

To meet any such deficit we have to the treasury, to addition to the gold reserve of 100.000,000. a surplus of more than fiat; 000,000 applicable to payment of the. ex penses of the government, "and which must, unless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if not extravagantly -wasted, must in any event be perverted front the purpose of its exaction from our peo ple, the payment, therefore, of any defi- clencyln the revenue from this fund to nothing more than its proper and legitimate use. It is Immeasurably better to appropri ate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invi tation to reckless appropriations and ex travagant expenditures. I suppose It will not be denied that under the present law our people obtain the neces saries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate than formerly. This is a mat ter of supreme Importance, since it is the palpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possible. The people should not be required to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living except under the stress of their govern ment's necessity made plainly manifest 

FINANCIAL. This reference to the condition and pros pects of our revenues naturally suggests aa allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been fre quently pressed upon the attention of the Congress in previous executive communica tions and the inevitable danger of their con tinued toleration pointed out Without now repeating these details, I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the neces- oiijr ui uic prompt retorm of a system op posed to every rule of sound finance and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and perplexity. The terrible civil war which shook the foundations of our government more than thirty years ago, brought in its train the destruction of property, ne wasting of our country's sub stance, anc. the estrangement of brethren. These are now past and forgotten. Ev.en the distressing loss of life the conflict en tailed is but a sacred mem'ory. which fos ters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a tender regard for those who noblv died. And yet there remains with us to-day, in full strength and activity as an incident of that tremendous struggle, a feature of its financial necessity not only unsuited to our present circumstances, but manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever present agent of monetary distress. Because we may be enjoying a temporary relief from its depressing influence this should not lull us into a false security or lead us to forget the suddenness of past visi tation. I am more convinced than ever that we can have not assured financial peace and safety until the government currency obli gations upon which gold may be demanded from the treasury are withdrawn from cir culation and cancelled. This might be done as has been recommended, by their exchange for long term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by their redemption with the" proceeds of such bonds. Even if only United States notes known as greenbacks were thus retired it is probable that the treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the act ot July 14, 1890, now paid In gold when demanded, would not create much disturbances, as they might from time to time, when received in the treasury by redemption of gold or other wise, be gradually and prudently replaced by silver coin. This plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly ap pears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. In default of this, however, it would be a step in the right direction if currency obli gations redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed should be cancelled instead of be ing reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but it would improve present conditions. National banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to issue cir culation to the par value of bonds deposited as security for its redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of 1 per cent The entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until our government abandons the banking business and the ac cumulation of funds, and confines its mone tary operations to the receipts of money contributed by the people for its support, and to the expenditure of such money for the people's benefit Our business interests and all good citizens long for rest from fev erish agitation, and the inauguration by the government of a reformed financial policy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the rewards of labor and industry.
