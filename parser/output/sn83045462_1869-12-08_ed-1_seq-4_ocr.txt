Worm ley, daughter of J# Andrew Wrrmky, a colored man of ttois city, took place lut evening abou* nine o'clock in tbe parlor of Hct. Dt- Wb ^of gt. Matthew's Cknrcb, the groom be'Lg of that faith, though the bride is a Presbyterian. Tbe wedding has Ven talked bf for weeks pa?t, but the exact tiime of it# consummation was kept secret until wiutio^ the part day or two. When it was stated tha* the parties were to be married by Dr. T? hite many were disposed to discredit the whole atfair. believing that Dr. White would not perform the ceremony of marrying a white man and colored woman. In thi* they were, however. mistaken, as the Catholic Church makes no prohibition on account of race or color, although she recognizes the different grades in society, and makes no attempt to interfere therewith. Shortly after seven o'clock last evening squads or colored women and children began to collect about the door of Dr. White's residence, and before nine o'clock quite a large crowd had amembled. though all were not admitted to the parlors until after the arrival of the bridal party and their friends. The bride entered the parlor leaning on the arm of her father, while the groom followed escorting Mrs. Wormley. The bride wasdrewed in white tarleton with narrow flounces, and trimming* of folds of white satin, white satin sasli. and white veil, with a wreath of orange Mosmhii* encircling her head, and carried in her h.-md a iKKjuet of white flower*. She is a bright mulatto of rather prominent features, large dark In own eves, heavy eye brows, and straight hair. She i* rather tall and of graceful figure. The ;ioora is about 5 feet 7 inches high? dark complexion and moustache. He was attired in a blaek suit, with a canary color neck tie, . ml *liite glove*. Th"re were no bridesmaids or ertfunnncn, though the bride wi? attended by >?iss Fisher, sister of General C. B. Fisher, of the Boys in Blue, who vnt? attired in white low corsage, anil richly trimmed. During the cer< Atony the neice ot tlie bride, a little girl abont twelve vears of age. occupied a jiosition at her side. -Mr. an?l .Mrs. wormley, the parents of the bride, were also present. I>r. White, before performing the ceremony, addressed the couple as follows: I have bo doubt* mv friends, that you have duly reflected on the im)>ortance of the contract ? hich vou are mbont to ratily in the presence of God. He himself is the founder of the conjugal alliance, and consecrated it to the most exalted end.- from the very beginning of th? world, immediately for t)ie i<erpetnalion of the human race, ultimately for the peopling of heaven witli saints. He has, therefore, onfained that this great institution, which is the foundation of society. shall not depend upon the whims of human paction or the vagaries of human opinion, but shall he permanent and tixed in its character, its relations, and its obligations. Hence, the so1? mu engagement by which yon are to be united as man and wife will bind yon together during | the whole period of your earthly existence; for 'what <Iod hath joined,' says the Scripture, 'let I no man nut tsinidpr.' Xothina hut ilpath n-ill be able to dissolve the union u{>on which yon now enter. This in the lofty view we must take of the matrimonial alliance. It is not the institution 01'man. and therefore we are not to look for its nature or its duties in the fallible wisdom of men. Having received its origin, its Messing from the Almighty himself, it is only In the light of religion?that if. in the infallible revelation of Uotl?that yon can discern the object, the nature and the obligations of that holy stab'. From these remarks yon will understand how necessary it is for you to be *ver mindful of the dignity and sanctity of the matrimonial tie, that you may animate yourselves by this consideration to a faithful discharge of your obligations. Let me entreat you never to lose sight of these sacred promises' you are about to utter as the basis or your confidence in each other, nor of that mutual fidelity which you now profess, and which is strikingly represented by the ring used in this ceremony as the seal of your lasting and happy union. Let religion direct you in all your actions, and vou will not be di$api?ointed in your hones. It w ill ipiaiifv vou to be the support and comfort t\f 1* <*. ?v i -t.

WIIICU you will exi>crienee; it will promote your happiness here, and, 1 hoi>e, prepare you for more permanent enjoyments hereafter." Dr. A\ Lite then announced that he would perform the ceremony of uniting them in the holy bonds of matrimony, ami he did so after having obtained a disj>eligation from the proper ecclesiastical authority. One of the parties having l?een bni 'tired, but the other (the bride) not having teen, it was necesearv to have a dispensation in order that the marriage be valid. This diM>eu>-ation had l>een given, and the marriage would therefore be valid. He then performed the cercmonv. but had to reiterate a good portion of it to ilie groom in French, as he could not understand English well. At the conclusion of the ceremony the couple received the congratulations of many friends, among whom were J>on Piatt and II. .1. Kaxnsdrll, of thr CltlamB CnMWrcinl, B. P. Brtok*.

Gerard is a Frenchman, and si>eaks English indifferently. He is of good family, and receives ;in annual income from his people in France. F. r the present he will reside here with his wife, :.t the residence of Mr. Wormlev. on 14th street.

The building now occupied as the Government Printing Office bw, under the increase of Its business, become insufficient for its projier accommodation. Indeed, it is impossible now to crowd within its walls sufficient machinery and operatives to I' up with the demands made upon its resources, especially in the binding department. I would therefore recommend, and urge upon Congress, that an addition to the present building be made aloug North Capitol street. Mine one hundred feet by sixty feet deep, lour ?tories high, and that it be constructed at the earliest practicable moment, and rendered fire-proof. The litiil'lings now used for storing the large quantities of paper necessarily kept on hand arc insufficient, inconvenient, unsuitable, and unsafe, and should be discontinued in their use for that puri>ose. Indeed, this improvement is urgently demanded by every consideration of duty to the public Interest. and will involve" an expense not exceeding ?1U0,?1j0.

Crane took the chair, and with a heavy cane rapped tbe aevmblage to order, and Kev. A. Bouldin nftipr* it nn a nravnr Dr. J. G. Stephenson offered ivsolntions cordially aj proving the action of Alderman K wry ami Councilmcn Holmes, Hatton and Brown, in condemning the unlawf ill awarding of a contract to .John Donovan, and their efforts to prevent its fraudulent execution and payments thereon; that the refusal of the Board ot Common Councils to hear their representatives on the question is an unwarrantable exercise of power, and app< aling from their action; thanking J. H. Crane tor his services as Commissioner of the Fourth Ward; expressing confidence in the integrity of .iacoo ti. ? rossman, laie r lour inspector, ana regretting the "malignity" which prompted his removal against the wishes of the people; dedaring that the proscription of men because they venture to diner in opinion from the Mayor deserves condemnation; declaring that the Mayor, in keepiilg Patrick Crowley for months employed an Commissioner of Improvements of the Fourth Ward without communicating with the Board of Aldermen, was reckless disregard of the law; and providing for the appointment of a committee of live to watch the progress of the Donovan contract. Major Morse moved to lay the resolutions on the table. Mr. Crossman rose to a point of order that the gentleman making his motion was not a member of the club. The Chair decided the point to be well taken. Major Morse declared that lie was a number. The Chair said that no member of the old club was a unmix r of this organization who had not sigreil the constitution before Nov. 1st. Mr. A. M.

On motion of Mr. Maurice Murphy, Mr. B. D. Peek was called to the chair. Mr. Crane protested, that he had paid for the use of the room, and that the attempt to organize another meeting was an usurpation of l>ower. Mr. Peck, on taking the chair, paid that he recognized every man present as a Republican, and would not rule any one out of order simply because he did not agree with him. Prof. A. M. Green was elected Secretary, amid great cheering. Mr. Hatton asked permission to make sonic remarks, but gave way to Prof. (Ircen, who offered resolutions declaring tliat the new constitution invalidates the membership of the club; that any attempt to forestall the will of the ltcSiublicans of the ward deserves the severest ooniemnation, and providing for a meeting next Tuesday to elect officers; which were adopted. Mr. Hatton continued, sayinc that he was a Republican t>till and would continue to vot<> the Republican ticket, notwithstanding ettbrt* had been made to groan him out of the party, lie. however, claimed the right to differ I'rutn mtii and argue question*, and ho long a* his acta met tlie approval of hi* conscience he would continue a lirni supporter of the party.

He referred to" the tact that men from Swampoodle had done much in the Republican ranks; that the Irish had fought as nobly for the pai tv as they had fought to free the colored race in tiie late war. and, in conclusion, he said that the colored people atone couin not carry mis city, anil therefore the white and colored workingmcn should unite, for their interests were identical. Mr. Green offered resolutions endorsing Mayor Bo wen, especially for the stand he has takenon the question raised regarding colored schools. Mr. J. H. Grossman read an address in which he si*aks of the Mayor in no verv complimentary terms. He says that the Mayor was formerly a Democrat, and asks where was he wlieu It cost something to be a Republican. While Mr. G. was reading his address, there were cries of "division," &c., but he was allowed to proceed. Mr. Green followed stating that had he read the address over Mr. C.'s signature he would have pronounced it a forgery and that the language of the address would better suit the Five Points than this meeting. Two years ago the same parties now attacking the Mayor were asking that he be exhalted as the noblest Roman of them all. He looked on the recent action In relation to the admission of a colored youth in Lut* rcuuuio us unnecessary, anu wir.ch action, if persisted In, would lead to the defeat of the party. He recognized the fact that when Mayor Bowen wan pushed to the wall, the question being forced upon him, be decided against his own interest for this measure is unpopular.

Yeat man, oeo. nsrwr, ?. r. nunt, Ttoeo. Barnes, Geo. Miller, Christian Kieney, Jos. Prather and B. S. Elliott entered suit against the Corporation of Washington for an injunction. The plaintiff's style themselves members of the ' Butchers' t'nion Association," and hie a bill gainst t^te Corporation of Washington, asking that the city be prohibited for the present from enforcing an ordinance passed 011 the 13th of ScpU-mber last prohibiting the use of srring balances In the city markets.? They set forth that they have ?>een in the habit of using such balances in the prosecution of their business in the markets of the city; that such balances are accurate, convenient, easily tested and occupy r.o room on the stall; and that they purchased the same and used them with the full consent of the city authorities, who, in 1855. nrovWeil n K*' ? v-"-u " ? ? _ .^.v ...... MJ nuuvil uic accua racy of balance* could be tested by tbe Insiiector of Weight* and Measures, and tbat it would be inequitable to compel them to purchase new scales at an increased expense. They affirm that ths only authority which the city had over the matter is contained in the act of Congress of 1820, which authorizes the corporation "to provide for tbe safekeeping of the standard weights and measures as lixed by Congress, and for the regulation of all the weights and measures used in the city." This act, they say, gives tbe city no power to prevent the use of spring balances in the market. Yet, they set forth tbe city has not only forbidden tbe use of such balances, under i>enalty of S10, but directed them to be seized whenever found in the market, and baa also instituted suits against several of tbe petitioners and fifteen other persons not members of tbe Union BnUhpn' elation, to compel the payment of the Hues. They, therefore, ask the court to perpetually enjoin the city authorities from enforcing the act i or September 13, after a final hearing of the case, and meanwhile to enjoin the Corporation ] from prosecuting any but a siagle salt for a violation of said law, until by such single suit the validity of the said set may be tested. The i Court ordered a rule to ?bew cause why the inimiction should not be issued as prayed to be sld upon the Mayor of Washington, and the case will cone'up again at a future day. ? vnuAAiAAi iua %jw xiue an. mmm of thb | Bar.?There has Just born organized In oar city i an organization entitled "The American Society < lor the Advancement of Legal 8ci?;nce."

Mr. McLean, of Boston, was invited to addrew* the Convention, and made an interesting address. Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, was next introduced. He t-aid the Convention had assembled for a great cause, the elevation and improvement of a race who had long been trodden down?the toiling millions. It was important to act with charity to each other, but he thought the people of the country were making rapid progTCKs in intellectual and mechanical improvement. Ten years ago the condition of the eolored race was precarious, and none could i>|>eak a word for their rights without peril of life; and now the colored race is as free as any other in the land. Ti n vear* aero tK<? mlnn>il mini vu not normi*. ted to go into the Capitol nor enter the Capitol Ejumls; now he was at free as any one, and he ped in a short time to welcome them as Senators.

He wanted the public domain administered so as to be ot benefit to the poor man, white and black. At the conclusion of Mr. Wilson's remarks he was greeted by long continued applause.

Mr. J. C. Wear*, or Philadelphia, then addressed the Convention. He doubted very much if a white man la a natural man, or a black man is a natural man. The middle was the normal color of the human race. Both the white and black man are truants from the natural and original color of the human species. The color was only incident to the climate, and the physical development, to the condition man is placed In. We demand our right to vote, not because of our color, but because we are men. If a man comes here from China, what right have we to refuse him the right to vote ? This right is a protection. He had no objection to making money out of men's muscle. We were afl striving to do what we can for ourselves. Every man will gravitate to the condition he is fitted toperform. Mr. J. T.

There never was a class made such progress as the colored laborers in the South. They bare to pay high rents to their old masters tor the use Df their broad acres. If they can obtain the wild lands of Kansas or other new States, they can live and thrive there without paying tribute. As to the eight-hour law, it will amount to nothing in the South. As to women's rights, lie hoped It would be confined north of the Ohio river. Mrs. Mary Carey, of Canada, made a few remarks, and the Convention adiourued.
