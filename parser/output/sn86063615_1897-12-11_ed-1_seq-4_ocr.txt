Tho rumor that the Democrats of the house have decided to make a party Issue of the Cuban question is not a very alarm ing report. Both official sentiment and popular sympathy have undergone some modification since the Cuban resolution passed the senate at the last session of con gress. There is no less friendliness to the cause of the Insurgents, but there is much more calmness and conservatism on the part of this country, and there is less in the policy of the new Spanish cabinet to aggra vate a neutral but friendly power.' Besides, the country has been shown that President MsKlnley's methods in handling the sub ject are more effective than all the bluster ing of congress and all tho popular demon stration made throughout this country. Our prisoners have been released, a more hu man system of warfare has been adopted, and a generous plan of autonomy has been proposed by the Spanish government, and all through the firm but essentially neutral course of the president. With the worst of the aggravation removed, and "with new and commendable policies In operation and others ready for application, there is no lorger the demand for Immediate action on the part of the United States. The people now generally Indorse tho president's patient but resolute attitude on this important problem. Any effort in con gress to force an aggressive policy at this time would be too manifestly fictitious and too avowedly political to carry with it the popular support essential to make such a movement a wise party procedure. It would be looked upon with the same disap proval as was given to ex-Mlnlster Taylor's mouthlngs. Taylor was no sooner relieved from his official obligations than he used the Information secured in office for his personal profit, reduced it to the quality of merchandise, 'and made of himself a de testable mountebank while trying to pose as a patriot. The Cuban question is not one for political trickery and barter. 

MORAL COWARDICE OP JURORS. Just now, when there is much discussion as to the inadequacy of our criminal courts to meet the demands of Justice, the re n,rt nr .Tudce Broaddus, one of the ablest Jurists on the Missouri bench, are perti nent and Interesting. Judge uroaauus, in Fpeaklng of the moral cowardice of Jury men, says: It is smpathy and moral cowardice on the part of Jurors that intervenes and clears guilty men. The defendants attor ney tells the Jury that it is better that ninety -nine guilty men escape than one in nocent man be unjustly punished. There are too many of the ninety-nine guilty ones escape. The reasonable doubt is used too much as a pretext to clear those guilty of crime. Every term of court there are guilty men turned loose to prey upon so ticty because of ths moral cowardice of Jurors. It is no trouble to secure an in dictment, but the difficulty lies in secur ing a -verdict of guilty. Our modernized courts havo become refugees for criminals. This was not so under the early common law courts of this country and of Great Britain." Few men have gone so far as to char acterize our criminal courts as refuges for the criminal. There are many, however, who will not regard the statement as one of particular exaggeration. But the weak ness of our Ejstem lies more with the priv ileges of the lawyers than with the cow ardice of the Jurors. The lawyers, first of all. have the privilege of rejecting venire men who may not suit their purposes, and their opportunities in this direction are so extended that the composition of many cf our Juries is a sad commentary upon cur conception of the intelligence that should sit in Judgment upon the law and the evi dence in criminal trials. Lawyers become good Judges of men. They select, as far as possible, those whom they believe will be susceptible to the eloquence or the theatricals they are privileged to bring to bear upon them. Jurors would haveImcre courage If the lawyers were given Ices op portunity to pervert their sense of duty. "When tho inev Itable reforms are made, cne of the first will be the confinement of the prosecutors and defenders to the unvarn ished tale of evidence and the intelligent exposition of law. THE OLD 1'LIQ AMI A RIGGER AP- propri vriov. At the recent national meeting of of ficers of tho National Guard at St. Louis a resolution was adopted asking congress to appropriate $2,000,000 for the support of the country's citizen soldiery. Instead of JIM.O00 as at rrcscnt. This Is the culmina tion of a feeling that has existed for Fome time that the i National Guard Is not suf ficiently encouraged by congress, consid ering its importance and possible useful ness. With our insignificantly small standing nrm the country's main dependence in the event of war wouM bo its militia. This great reserve force should receive all the proper encouragement possible, and un doubtedly its organization and equipment cculd be much improv ed by raising the ap pi oprlatlon to $2Oj0.000. At the same time, the government is expending large sums of morcy just now in building up the navy nnd -trengthening coast defenses. The out lay for pensions is at its height, making ar enormous expenditure for this purpose. The probability Is that congress cannot sec Its war clear to doing much, if any thirg, more for the National Guard this session than heretofore, however reason able and meritorious its claims may be. The presidnt has urged economy and there is a disposition in theJbouse,.at least, to keep expenses down as low as possible. If the1 National Guard succeeds In getting its allowance raised to $600,000 an increase of ra per cent It may legird itself as fortu nate. a ri.Eini,E cinnrv. In the currency reform plan prepared by Secretary Gage and recommended to congress by President McKinlcy, great stress Is laid upon the necessity of at taching flexibility to the bank note cir culation of the country. Under the sy stem now in practice it is impossible to swell speedily this medium, and for all prac tical purposes it remains upon a dead, un yielding level. Inst inces might be multi plied to show the advantage of a -vstem by which, in times of urgent mone de mand, the national banks may Increase their note circulation. In m:, when the banks of New York were trembling on the verge, such a svstem was forced into ef fect without the permission of congress and it is certain that it averted a terrible panic. The l-suince of clearing houe certificates became virtually an Increase in the bank note circulation and it tldd over the money stringency after a fashion that should have been an impressive les son to American financier-. Secretary Gage mentions in his report several annually recurring conditions un der which the need of a flexible currency is sorely felt. At the time of moving the great crops, such as wheat, corn and cot ton. It becomes necessary for local bankers to borrow money for the purpose from other sections of the country a process that is attended with trouble and expense. If the banks were empowered 'to issue the credit money required for this purpobe, their customers could be served more speedily and with less expense than under the present si stem. It is shown by Mr. Gage that In the Southern states the na tional banks are compelled at cotton mov ing time each scar to borrow about $10, 000.000. These banks combined have a cap ital of $68,000,000, and under tho proposed plan they would be empowered to Issue 

J17.O00.O0O in addition to the regular Issue secured by the deposit of government bonds at only the expense attached by the government In the form of a 2 per cent tax. Thus, without borrowing a cent, the banksof the South would be able to move the cotton crop. The objections to the Gage plan of pro curing flexibility have mostly come from those who regard a credit currency as un safe. As the government guarantees pay ment to the note holder it can only be come unsafe to the government. In reply to those who fear the government might lose by such a guarantee it may be said that sufficient data is at hand to show beyond any question that the tax proposed would be sufficient to make the govern ment whole against any losses, even with out the additional safeguards provided by the Gage plan. It is estimated by Mr. Gage, after a careful scrutiny of national bank history for thirty years, that a 1 per cent tax would be sufficient to collect together a safety found ample to meet all defaulted notes, but to make absolutely sure ho fixed the rate at 2 per cent. In this connection our attention Is called to the fact that there Is more or less mis understanding of tho Gage plan. Wo have noticed editorials in one or two Popocratlc papers which gravely Informed their read ers that tho secretary proposed to allow national banks to issue money which the government would guarantee without ex acting security. There Is no material dif ference between the law as it now stands and the one proposed, except that the pro posed law gives the right to banks to issue an additional 23 per cent of their capital In notes after they have issued notes to the par value of the bonds de posited by them in "Washington. To se cure this additional 25 per cent the gov ernment will hold a first Hen upon the bank assets and in addition will hold the safety fund derived from the 2 per cent tax. This taxation serves still another purpose. It will stand In the' way of an undue inflation of the national bank cur rency. It is large enough to prohibit un necessary Issue and small enough to per mit the meeting of all financial emergen cies. EDITORIAL AOTES. The civil service law will be wiped out at about the same time Santa Claus Is abol ished. Weyler expresses surprise that Spain would tolerate President McKinley's criti cisms of him. Weyler is an amusing beast. Mr. Bryan Is thoughtful enough to keep his friends at home posted on the "en thusiastic ovations" accorded him In Mex ico. Uncle Sam finds It necessary to "bevare of the vldders." Too many adventuresses are getting on the pension rolls as relicts of -veterans. Governor Atkinson, of Georgia, has spoiled his record as a champion of good order and humanity by -vetoing an anti football bill. This is a remarkable session of congress. Almost a week has elapsed and no bill for the free and unlimited coinage of silver has been Introduced. The excellent quality of the president"! message Is now established. It has been condemned by about everybody whose bad opinion is worth havirg. If the murderers of Mics Schumacher are captured it will go hard with them, unless tbey should happento have sufficient money to buy a criminal court jury. It is said that Thomas r. Bayard will be a candidate for United States senator from Delaware to succeed Senator Gray. Has Mr. Bayard taken out naturalization pa yers? Tho supreme court'of California has de cided that Durrant must hang. If Durrant hadn't become thoroughly used to this sort of thing the decision would be quite a r-Llow to him. The people of the United States are gen erally in favor of annexing Hawaii, but they are not excited about the matter. The report that the senate will not confirm the treaty Is not particularly harrowing. Congressman Bailey's remark that oppo sition to the civil service system was em bedied In the Democratic national plat foim should remind General Grosvenor that he Is browsing In the enemy's coun try. Experiments in rural free mall delivery have been made In sveral states, but the public has heard -very little about them. It Is now to bo tested in Kansas, where the whole country will witness the exhibi tion. The wiseacres all predict that congress will do very little this session. Happily, the country will not suffer seriously if this prc- diclion be fulfilled, thanks to the good work already done by the Republican party. Leg islation is needed, but it is not absolutely necessary. The losses by fire in this country last month under the Dingley bill were nearly $2.000000 greater than in the corresponding month of last year under the Wilson b'll Yet partisan Republicans tell us the Dirg Iey bill Is a prosperity meaure! A hy should Democratic organs be s0 worried about the revenue deficit? Doe;n't the consumer pay the tariff tax, and Un't a shortage of revenue merely a proof that the consumer is getting oft lightly ? 1-u't the Democratic party tho great champion of the consumer's intere-ts? Tut, tut! The story that President McKinlcy snubbed Speaker Reed In tho matter of official patronage, and that Mr. Red is going to fight the administration In conse quence, is a particularly stupid piece of Democratic Invention. Both the president and the speaker are too big to indulge in child s plaj . Superintendent Greenwood is a good man who seems to think all other men are hon est and honorable. Mr. Greenwood should cultivate supiciousncs The statement may surprise him. but it Is a fact that there are confidence men and bunco steer ers abroad in the land, looking for innocent farmers and school superintendents. 

1CANSVS TOPICS. The cost and Inconvenience of transport ing money from one part of the country to another was aptly illustiatcd at Topck i the other d ly when it became nece-sary for the Rock Island railroad to send $237, 000 to Chicago. If the money had been sent In greenbacks or gold the express charges would have been ?J21 TO, if in sli ver, $377 73, but the railroad people reject ed all three and made the transfer with a bank draft at a cost of only 2 cents. The credit money is the real money of the country, and laws to strengthen it are wiser than laws in relation to the coinige of any metal. The Concordia Empire tells the story of a cranky old granger of Cloud county who nearly wore the life out of Senator Plumb In soliciting him to procure a patent upon what the granger called a "principle." The old man's theory was that for every thing there is an oppo-Ite a reaction for the action and that it held true ot the law of gravitation. He claimed that he had discoveied the reaction for gravitation. By the application of his discovery things would lose their weight and a man could as readily fall up to the top of his barn as down into his cellar. Some years ago the old man removed to Moore, O. T., where he is still exploiting Ins principle and worrying public men for their aid in securing a patent upon it. It is a mistake to suppose that all men delight to attend banquets and load their hides with champagne, pate de foie gras and post prandi il oratory. Atchison gave a banquet to the siting mayors and coun cllmen of Kansas cities the other night and Balie Waggoner was selected for toast master. He played sick and remained away. Bill White, of Emporia, and Ed Howe, of Atchison, were on the pro gramme, but they also remained away. White going to Howe's house to spend the evening. About 9 o'clock Waggener got lonely at his home and telephoned to Howe to come over and bring White along. Howe thought Waggener was telephoning from the banquet hall and responded In this manner: "I am too sick to get out anywhere to night, and White has already started." As a matter of fact. White was silting in Howe's room, and -a moment later congrat ulated the Atchison man on getting him out of the necessity of going to that feed. The matter is mentioned simply for tho reason that 'when three such -voracious and up right citizens as Waggoner. Howe and White will lie like horsethleves to get out ot going to a banquet, it must appear that ruch affairs are not so alluring as most people suppose. In tho preliminary examination of Snod giass, who Is charged with the murder of Upton, at Newton, a very pert witness mado her appearance in the person of Miss Dell Morgan, the sister of Mrs Snodgrass. While being cross-examined by Attorney BLcher, she said: "Mr. Bucher, y ou are not so awful smart. Some day you'll get your feathers pulled out like the parrot." At an other time she said: "Bucher, you and Brother Allen would make a fine team There is a good deal of guesswork about both of you." Tho local paper says Miss Morgan was not called down by the presid ing justice, and that her sallies at the law yers were greeted with loud laughter from the spectators. Not content with reciting in an unfair way tho fact that Henry Inman had been cashiered from the United States army several Kansas papers have charged that, In placing his name upon the title page of his book as "Colonel Henry Inman," he has promoted himself beyond any titlo which he has the right to bear. Notwithstanding the fact that thU "Kan sas author has been known for twenty -five years only as "Major Inman," he never tl cless Is entitled to bear the title of colo nel, his patent to It having been confirmed by the United States senate in ISO. Before the war Colonel Inman was a private In the Ninth United States infantry. In 1SC0 hf was promoted to the rank ot second lieutenant. At the battle of Game's Mill, on June 27, 1C2, he was desperately wound ed while gallantly leading a charge, and later was recommended by his commanding officer for the brevet of captain. At the seme time the names of 3,000 other officers were sent to the senate for confirmation in bievet ranks. Of these only live besides Ccloncl Inman received the, coveted con iumation. Later he was made a full cap tain, and still later he was breveted major, and again confirmed by the senate. During the terrible Indian wars In West ern Kansas, from 1SC7 to 1S69. Colonel In man was quartermaster to General Phil Sheridan, who commanded the region In person. At the conclusion of these naf, General Sheridan recommended Colonel In man and one other officer for brevet rank, and both were confirmed by the senate, the titlo of lieutenant colonel going to Inmar. Among Colonel Inman's most carefully guarded treasures is a letter from General Sheridan to President Grant, In which tie general says: "it is but my duty to say that the success of our expeditions in West ern Kansas Is due; more to the serv ices of Major Henry Inman than those ot any one other officer In the command " It is understood among the friends of Colonel Inman that an early effort' will be rrade to clear his name of the tarnlshmcr.t of dismissal from the government service b a court-martial. General Miles, who is now at the head of the federal armv, has pergonal knowledge of the circumstances of Colonel Inman's case and it is confidently bclieed that he will recommend to con gress the reinstatement of the dlsml-sed officer. Mrs. Henry Adslt, wife ot the sheriff of Crawford county, last week came Into pos session of a -very funny "card of thanks" -voted to her by the prisoners confined ill the Crawford county Jail. Mrs Ad-It had supplied the prisoners with a fine Thanks giving dinner and it was In recognition of this that tho prisoners sent their respects to the lady as follows: "The dinner was so bounteous that for the time being it caused us to forget the fact that we were prisoners, and Mrs. Afisit, thoughtful to a degree seldom seen In sheriffs' wives, came to trie door to in quire if; we had enough, and the an-wer was enough and some to spare, and it Is the opinion of the Inmates that she is a woman among women, we shoulu say, one among a thousand, and the opinion of tho' many inmates here at present, and who have been here during this administration, is that her equal is not In all Kansas. And desiring to show our appreciation ot Jicr efforts for our personal comfort we extend to her a vote of thanks without a dissent ing voice, and the inmates will not forget her many acts of kindness shown them; and the inmates in years hence will look back to the, time spent in the Criwford county jail under her watchful care as one" of the most pleasant times ever spent In" Jail." Yesterday morning a crowd of men might hive been seen on the Seventh street side of the National hotel in Topeka. gazing curiously upon the remains of a lot of erockeiy that hid been broken in the -treet, together with one or two pieces cf chamber furniture that had become a to tal wreck. Investigation discovered thit all of this stuff had been thrown from a third story bedroom window in the hotel by certain membtrs of the state board of charities who had spent the night in a high old jamboree. According to all ac counts, scver.il of the reformers got howl ing drunk Some time after midnight peo ple who were in the olhce of the hotel on the ground floor were attracted to the street by the sound of smashing crockery. Looking aloft they discovered a man who bore a close resemblance to W. L Brown, of Kingman county, who is president of the board, busily engiged in pitching crockery out of his bedroom window, while from behind him e ime a medley of shouts and laughter which showed that his rui-sts were heartily enjoying the perfoimance. Tirst came a pitcher, then a washbowl, then a soapdlsh, then a spittoon, etc. The members of the state bo ird of charities have been staving at the National for several days while engaged in the busi ness of letting contracts for supplies fcr the state Institutions. In their jamboree on Thursday night they were Joined by several traveling men who have been at tending the meeting for the purpose of bid ding on contracts. Yesterday vigorous at tempts were made to hush up public ac counts of the affair, but all day the wreck ot the bedroom furniture was left lying In the street to attract the attention of the curious. Such a pile of broken crockery was in sight that it might be seen at the distance of a block, and it is probable that the furnishings of two or more rooms were pitched out of the window. And this is Retorm with a big R. Leedy is up against additional trouble in his project of calling a special session of the legislature. Tho Winiield Courier re counts that Representative Ed J iquins has gone to Seattle, and that he will probably engage in some deal connected with the Klondike country. Jaqulns makes the fourth Populist maximum rater who would be absent from the legislature if it should be called in special session. In the house the maximum rate feature was -voted down by a ote of 62 to 53. If no changes have taken pluce except those accounted for by absentees, the maximum raters would have but 52 -votes in the special session, while 63 are necessary to pass a bill. There will be no special session. Speaking of the proposed special session, it is believed by the Topeka. Capital that all of the rumors and reports In relation to it emanate from tho office of Governor Leedy. There is pretty good evidence that Governor Leedy starts the report that he Is about to call the session and then denies it. or at least denies that he has made up his mind, with the sole purpose of keep ing the issue in a state of agitation. Un doubtedly the governor will attempt to make maximum rates the issue at the elec tion next year, and it is doubtful If he would call the legislature in special ses sion even if he was absolutely a-sured that a maximum rate bill could be passed. Some three w eeks ago the cable dispatch es reported the presence in Stockholm, Sweden, of a demented Indian girl by the name of Emily Waite, who was causing all sorts of excitement by claiming to be the rightful queen of the Swedes. The rela tives of Miss Waite live at Purcell, I. T., and they hao no 'idea how she got so far away as Sweden. She ran away from homo several years ago One day last week these relatives received a letter from tho United States minister in Sweden in forming them of the girl's condition. They at once sent a draft for $200 to the minis ter, with the request that she be sent home. Miss Waite is a Chickasaw and has been well educated. Her people are well-to-do, and have been searching for her for a long time. 

3IISSOLHI POINTS. Clinton can now talk over tho long dis tance telephone with Nevada or Tort Scott if it has the price, which is $1 for a day time hello and 50 cents at night. Joseph O'Neal, who is talked of as tho probable Democratic nominee for governor in Kentucky next time, is a nephew of "Uncle Sara" Smith, of Plattsburg. The Butler Democrat has been on eartn a sufficient period to bo entitled to a place among tho old-timers. It celebrated its twenty-ninth birthday- anniversary the oth er day. Peoplo who still claim to doubt the return of prosperity have ovidently overlooked the statement that a recent church sociable in Clinton county netted the gospel cash account $30. Some unintentionally overlooked but still yearning soul may find the opportunity of her life In the announcement In the Hop kins Journal that "there Is a man in this town, over SO years) old, who wants to get married." "They're making It so hot for Luetgert In his second trial In Chicago," according to tho Maryvlllo Tribune, "that. It is said, the ex-sausagemaker now deeply regrets that he didn't lure his wife to Kansas City to kill her." An awfully- shocking rumor comes from staid old Bethany. It Is whispered that a "Jack, the Peeper," has been infesting that village this week, just think of It, and the state gathering of the female suf fragists in progress there, too! Tho Lewiston (Me.) Journal says that "a man In St. Joseph, Mo, who has thirteen wiv es, has been punished by a ten-year sen tence In the penitentiary'." whereupon the Chicago Times-Herald remarks: "Impossi sible; how can a penitentiary sentence pun ish a man who 'has thirteen wives?" Missouri can match any of 'em. A Dade county woman wrote to Bnce, the Chicago "gold-maker," the other day that she was in possession of a formula for making gold that beats his, but that being a little shy of cash she would sell her secret for a rea sonable sum and permit him to reap the benefit of the discovery. Boonville, which has long mourned the lack of one, seems now in a fair way to secure a new opera house of credltablo size and equipment. Ihe local Knights of Pythias lodge has $5 000 in cash which it talks of u-ing as a nucleus for a fund for tho erection of a $13,000 building for use both for auditorium and secret society purposes. p s r.inir has become sole proprietor of the Republican paper at Jefferson City. He has made a marked improvement in its appearance already, having substituted the single word' Courier for the lengthy hy phenated name it formerly struggled un der, and altered Its get-up advantageously In other respect-. Mr. Fisher Is to continue in editorial charge. An eagle measuring seven feet from tip to tip was killed bv Farmer Patterson a short distance out from Evcrton the other day. Mr. Patterson had noticed the big bird circling about and manifesting an un warranted interest in the chickens and young pigs on his place at intervals for several years, but had been unable be fore to get an effective shot at it. Plattsburg people apparently failed to ap preciate what an interesting entertainment v as in store for those who attended tho lectures' by Professor Dyche, of the Kansas university. Tho audiences were so small and the receipts so meager that except for the generosity of the lecturer TJr. Sharp, who induced the distinguished explorer to visit 'Plattsburg, would have lost heavily through tho arrangement. The old log shanty In the rear of the Monroe house, which is now being torn down, is one of Jefferson City's most ven erable landmarks. It was built some sixty live years ago and occupied as a home by one of the wealthiest residents of Cole county at that time. The impression is prevalent elsewhere In the state that Jeff has other landmarks, animate as well as Inanimate, that might be spared. The new barn recently completed for Col onel Bices, Macon's millionaire, is one of the most expensive buildings in North Mis souri, and undoubtedly the finest barn in tho state outsldo the largest cities. More than 

SO.OOO feet of the best lumber that could be procured was used in its construc tion. The roof required 56 0U0 shingles, and more than 22.C00 feet of ceiling lumber and nearly SO 000 feet of weatherboardlng were u-ed. Tho inside Is finished with hard pine and is oiled and amlshed, the Hour space is nearly all covered with granitoid pavement, and the entire building is heat ed with steam and supplied with all mod ern conveniences. The Maryville Review tells this remark able tale concerning a Nodiway county man, and -vouches for its truth: "Paul Pelkey. of Fllmorc, is still living and is 102 years old. He took sick and died forty years ago, wus dressed in grave clothes and was placed in a cofiin in an upstairs room at his home. Tho funeral was ready to start and the stairs were ery narrow and old-fashioned, and but two men could handle the coffin. They started down the stairway with the coffin and one of the men slipped, and down went the coffin bumpty bump. The coffin broke open and the corpse sat up and rubbed his eyes and asked for a drink of water and Paul Pel key's funeral was put off Indefinitely and has not since been announced, and it is said is not likely- to be for some time to come." The wild pigeon no longer isits South west Missouri with the return of the mast season, as formerly. Years ago the woods of the Ozark region were full of these birds from October till January. A pigeon roost was the wonder and delight of the pio neer hunter. Millions of the birds would gather in some thick forest at the approach of night. From all directions and for miles away- dense flocks of pigeons could be seen flying towards the roost. The unerr ing instinct of the birds guided them to the place and by sundown the flutter of count less wings sounded like an approaching storm in the -vicinity of the .roost. Hunt ers killed the birds by the thousands, for in a roost no skill was required to shoot pigeons. A shotgun fired into any tree or bush at random never failed to bring down game. The ground was often nearly covered with dead and wounded birds after a -volley had been fired Into a tree loaded down with pigeons. Hogs fattened on the crippled birds left In the woods and hawks, owls, foxes and other wild animals had a continual feast. The last pigeon roost ot any importance near Springfield was not far from the Hopewell church, south of the James river, about twenty -four years ago. The birds occupied a thick oak for est covering several acres and remained three or four w ceks. Circulation Still Gronlnfr. From the Boston Herald. There was another large increase in the circulation last month. The amount ot money circulating outside of tho treasury reached the enormous total of $1.721.0S4,53S, In comparison with $1,706,732,901 on the first of November, and $1,646,02S,246 at the be ginning of tho fiscal year. Thl3 is an in crease of $14,331,631 during November, and of $73,036,202 in the five months since July 1. To show the changes In the various classes of money, we present below an analysis of tho returns on December 1. in comparison with the figures noted oh the 1st ult.: 

CIRCULATION. Dec. 1. 1S97. Nov. 1. ISO- Gold $51 220157 Greenbacks 310S2SO0O $576,0SS,OC2 30i,3I.99!( 101.7o9.9m C0.196 77S 372.S3S.919 225.131.263 G3.4o2.929 Treasury notes 104,676 39S Silver dollars 61.2S0 761 Silver certificates ... 373 20'67 National bank notes 224 056 210 Subsidiary silver .... 64.S29.015 Totals $1,721,084,538 $1,706,732,904 Tho gold In circulation shows an increase of $3,132,095 for the month, and we may note while we are referring to the yellow metal that there was also a considerable addition to the gold held by the treasury, which stood at $157,363.S51 on the 1st Inst., In com parison with $153,573,148 on November 1, a gain of $3,710,703. Putting the two classes together, we find that the total stock of gold In the country amounts by the latest official rating to $73S.5S4,0OS, in comparison with $729,661,210 on November 1, and $697, 223,332 on July 1. This is an increase of $S,922,79S during November, and of no less than $41,360,676 for the five months of the fiscal y ear. Passing from gold to paper, we find that there was a -very considerable addition to the paper money circulation In November. The greenbacks lead, with an increase of $3,541,002; the treasury notes are a close second, with an increase of $2,916 443. There is also a slight increase of $460,04$ in the sil ver certificates, while the national bank notes exhibit a slight decrease of $17S,053. Thus the net addition to the paper circula tion amounts to $6,739,440. As regards sil ver, tho standard dollars have made a further gain of $1,0S3 9S3, and the subsidiary silver coin also shows a growth of $1,396 116. The two Items, taken together, ex hibit an increase of $2,4i0 099. Summing the comparison. It will bo noticed that of the total Increase of $14,351,634. $5,132,0'V Is in gold, the money ot the world, and $9 219 539 Is In various forms of domestic money, available only for use in this country. This large growth of unexportable cash is at tributed to the exchange of gold for paper money with the treasury and to the net disbursements of the department on ac counts of the deficiencies of the revenue. So Tariff QueMlon Remain. From the New York Press. The tariff president puts the tariff behind him. Eternally right is he, though some what confusing to those who have consid ered him a one-sided man, who ewed his presidency as a glorified chairmanship of the ways rnd means, a protectionist mo nocracy. There Is no tariff question. It was set tied for our time by the action of the extra session of tho Fifty-fifth congress, called for tho purpose of settling it in accord ance with tho urgent demands of the electorate of the United States is-ued in November, 1S94, confirmed in November, 1596. There may be revenue questions, though fortunately none so serious as not to be solved by the imiwsltion of a tax which will not deepen by a sixteenth of an inch the layer of froth which now crowns what our "Continental Sunday" friends are fond of calling "the people's beer." But the tariff question is done, and will be until such time as the American pro ducer or tho American consumer not the Anglophile American politician shows signs of desiring Its undoing. With a gold en eloquence of silerce the president rec ognizes the fact. t IVIndr "Willie Wants to Help. From the New York Sun. The Hon. John F. Shafroth, a Colorado member of the house of representatives. Is on hand again with an old plan of his that fairly sags beneath Its weight of wis dom. He is going to "sae several mil lions of dollars to the government every j ear" by the following simple measure: "When the current expenses of the gov ernment exceed the reenues, the salaries op all employes of the government shall be scaled down. Those who draw ocr $l,2irt per year shall be scaled down 20 per cent, and all who draw less than that sum shall be scaled down 10 per cent, and the reduced rates shall continue In force until such time as the reenues will equal the cur rent expenses. I have studied the prop osition with care, and bellev e I can m ike a good showing for the measure. At tirst It looks like a simple scaling down ot sal- aries, but that is not the Idea, nor is it the main feature. The measure Is framed to stop unwise appropriations by congress, and it puts a forfeit of $S0 per month on each congressman if the appropriations are in excess of the revenues." Mr. Shafroth thinks that he has found the ablest recipe for economy that the world has seen since the Hon. Edward At kinson began to devastate mankind and save Its pennies by means ot his Aladdin Oven. But Mr. Shafroth will not be al lowed to sh.ire his laurels unmolested. The Hon. William Jennings Bryan has about trade up his mind to sacrifice his celebrated diamond bosom pin and to apply the pro ceeds toward the payment of the national debt. Mr. Ilnllej'. Wntchful Erci. From the Chicago News. "I shall keep a watchful eye on our Re publican friends during the session and see that they do not have everything their own way. We Democrats, though in the minority, shall make our presence felt." Thus spoke the Hon. Boy Bailey as tho squads of statesmen were gathering In the nation's capital preparatory to Keeping 70, OuO.OUO apprehensive citizens guessing. It is all up with the Republicans if Mr. Bailey keeps his pledge. The Hon. Nelson Dingley will go through the session hoping to paste his tariff on something or other, but the watchful eye of the Dreaded Eagle of the Sage Bush will be upon him. When the Hon. Mr. Walker attempts to fool with the nation's banking laws he will be con fronted by that Eye. Mr. Bailey speaks of but one watchful eye, when. In fact, he ha- two. The other is never taken from the constitution of the United States. Various attempts have been made to picture the fate of that document if Mr. Bailey- should relax the gaze of his off eye, with only Infantile success. All admit, however, that it would he disas trous. It may be interesting to the public to read a description of Mr. Bailey's watchful eyes His starboard eye is three feet in diameter and h is a magnify ing power of 256.700,901 and it Is constantly Improving. The retina has a surface of 

SOO.O-JO square feet and will retain a picture for years. Tho sight of this eye will penetrate a Re publican motive sixty -three feet thick with out blinking a winker. In a contest of the Texas Circle of Watchful Eyes Mr. Bailey's starboard eyo s iw three times around the earth and discovered a Democratic victory In a strongly Republican district. Mr. Bailey's port eye, with which he watches the constitution, possesses even more extraordinary powers. It not only sees objects In front, but through the back and top of Mr. Bailey's head. This ac counts for Mr. Bailey's ability to discuss questions of state through hb headgear. A beetled Reform. From the Chicago Record. This matter of Miss Richardson, Govern or Bradley, the 43-y ear-old bottle of whisky and ex-Secretary Herbert i growing to the proportions of a national calamity. The latest information shows how it a'l hap pened and should be published to the world as a warning to future secretaries of the na-vy. Ex-Secretary Herbert met Miss Richardson and accepted the offer of tho middle-aged bottle simultaneously. Under the fascinating spell of the ono -and the mellowing cheer of the other he grew ex pansive and remarked that Miss Richard son was better fitted to christen a battle ship than any other lady of his rather large acquaintance. That was all, but it was enough. Secretary- Herbert ceased to be secretary and now has no more to say- about christening battle-ships than the man in the moon. And now he is hearing from Miss Richardson, who has taken occasion to relieve her fesl-lng- by- calling him "an old widower in his, dotage." He will never receive another 45-year-old bottle from her not at least for Internal application. He is to be held up to scorn and opprobrium as a flatterer of youth, a guileful breaker of promises and a mean old thing. So far as It lies withl-i the power of a fair Kentutkians earnest ness and an Inexhaustible How- of English, tho ex-secretary is to go down in history contemned among men. It 'is suggested that to forefend future distressing occurrences the cabinet at its next meeting adopt a rule forbidding any secretary of tho navy- at any- time in the future even hinting that he Is going tD have a battleship christened until the ship has passed into his control and the cardi date for the sponsorship is already rtrmly cstablished on tho -vessel's bow with tho baptismal bottle securely clutched in her hand. Ellmlnatlnir the "Nccro Vole. From the New Orleans Times-Democrat. Seme idea of tho sweeping effect that the new registration law- has had in elim inating the negro v ote can be had from the reports that have reached the city from a few of the country parishes. In the parish of Plaquemines, which formerly had a negro registration of 2 500, only five blacks have so far registered. In the parish of West Baton Rouge five negroes are said to have presented themselves up to lust week for registration, but none were com petent, and In consequence all were re fused. Unless things have changed in the last few days there Is not a negro on the registration rolls in West Baton Rouge. Correct Speech la School. rrom the Indianapolis News. It would seem that one of the chief cares of schools and colleges would be that stu dents should learn to speak correctly. The mental drill that accompanies the study of language is invaluable. Of course. It is easy- to say- th it there are m iny things in lift more important than correct speaking. This is true, but as a nation we are old enough to have acquired not merely- the essentials, but some of the graces as well. In other words, it is time we were adding to our common schooling evidences of culture. And one of the most Indisputable of these is correct speech. A Roar From Beahen. From the Chicago Inter Ocean. The Omaha World-Herald, trying to kill two birds with one stone, says: "By care fully seizing all opportunities "offered for annexing outside territory, Kansas City hopes that In time she will hae as much raw prairie within her borders as Chicago." The journall-tic Omahog Is putting on .i heap of metropolitan airs, and sneers at everything of a bucolic nature. And yet lits own town I- an especially neat speci men of rus in urbe. A Prophecy. From tho Atchison Globe. A ithin two years, pictures of Mrs. Colo nel Lease and W. J. Bryan will be seen onlv In connection with patent medicine advertl-emcnts. Both are rapidly going Into obscurity. By the way, the Globe pre dicted more than a year ago that Mr. Bry an's name would not be mentioned In the next national Democratic convention. If the prediction does not come true, jou aro invited to laugh at us. DniiKcr of the Future. Trcm the Chicago Post. "It masculine and feminine ideas of ap propriate dress, especially in the way of outing costumes, continue to movo along on converging lines." -aid the man who al ways finds something to worry about, "I can plainly see that the time will come when the man who refuses to wear a beard or mustache will be arrested for masquerading as a woman." The Cheerful Idiot. From tho Indianapolis Journal. "I wonder how the English came to adopt red as a color for uniforms?" asked the boarder whose specialty is useless ques tions. "Perhaps 'twas done." said the cheerful idiot, "in defiance of the papal bull." ot Hia Fault. From the New York Press. The queen regent "What do you mean, sir, by not doing as I tell you? Why don't you give that autonomy to the Cubans?" Blink Blanco "Please, ma'am, I I can't catch them!" THE YEAR'S CROWJ. Spring has her changeful skies, her waking leaes Summer her lavish dower of bloom and balm: And Autumn has her days of golden calm Rich pauses when, forgetting she bereaves The world of Summer, she no longer grieves. She smiles, "How well beloved a queen I am!" Lingering to hear the land's Thanks giving psalm For w ealth of fragrant fruit and, garnered sheaves. But Winter is tho monarch of tho year. AVhen w'ild winds make the giant pines their harp. And joy of Chrlstmastlde 13 at the flood. Only to those who ml-s a presence dear The thorns ot Winter's holly -crown ar sharp; And all Its berries gleam like drops of blcod. Charles Prescott Shermon. TRITII ABOLT LITTLE MO-PEEP. Oh. little Bo-Peep. she lost her sheep. And didn'.t know where to find 'em; Oh. leave 'em alone, and they'll come home. And bring their tails behind 'em. Now, If little Bo-Peep had watched her -heep. She wouldn't hae had to rue it: Ala-, what a shame! that a maid with a name So pretty as this could do it! But little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep. And that Is- tho truth of the matter; And all of the sheep of little Bo-Peep Concluded that they would scatter. So little Bo-Peep lay down in the deep Rich grass, and the bio omed clover; While the wind in the trees, and the hum ot the bees. Sang a lullaby over and over. Said Ilttlo Bo-Peep, "I will only sleep The tiniest little minute." But a wee little head, on a clover bed. Has lots of queer notions in it. For little Bo-Peep went fast asleep. And that Is the truth of the matter; And she slept away the livelong day. Till the dog came barking at her. Then little Bo-Peep commenced to weep For her sheep but she couldn't find 'era; "Oh, leave 'em alone and they'll corns home," Said the wind, "with their tails behind 'em." So Ilttlo Bo-Peep saw her lambkins leap Again over the waving heather; And they stood by the door of the fold once more. All huddled up close together. But. alas! Bo-Peep. for your pretty sleep. That a wink or two could sever. She had let 'em alone and they had coma home. But they had no tails whatever. -C. M. S. MV KINGDOM. I am owner of the sphere. Of the seven stars and the solar year. Of Caesar's hand and Plato's brain, Ot Lord Christ's heart and Shakespeare's strain. R. W. Emerson. OF ClIinENT I.NTEREST. The sensational gossip mongers tried to stir up a social explosion because the pres ident's public receptions have been fixed for the same day the cabinet ladies re ceiv e, but they failed. They are not trying to get up a church sensation by the report that the president will no longer attend service at the Metropolitan M. E. church, w here he has a pew. because of the sermon preached by the pastor. Dr. Johnson, on Thanksgiving , day. This will also fall, a Washington writer says, for the president is not disturbed by Dr. John son's sermon or the sermons of any other pulpit orators. He does not seek to dictate what the preachers shall say. He is ready to have them criticise government policies as freely as other people do. H will con tinue to attend the Metropolitan church or any other church that suits him. A merchant who lives near Boston num bers among his acquaintances and friends an old colored preacher, by whom he was recently Invited to make a Sunday morn ing call at the church over which the latter presides. The merchant, although wishing most heartily- to accept the invitation, and to bring his wife also, was somewhat in doubt as to tho propriety of so doing. "I am afraid," he said, in explanation, "that our presence would not be wholly pleasant to your congregation." The shepherd re assured him. "Why. sah." he exclaimed, "dere's so many white folks in dat church some Sundays, mah congregation looks like a han'ful of blueberries in a bowl of milk!" The largest life insurance policy ever Is sued was written in New York last Mon dav, calling for $1,000,000 insurance on tho life of George W. Vanderbllt. who sailed f jr Europe yesterday on atriparound the world. The policy was what Is knowtfas a twenty payment life contract, and provides for a premium of about $33 0"0 a y ear. After Mr. Vanderbllt has paid that sum yearly for twenty years the payments cease nnd tho principal becomes due at hU death. The next largest policy ever written Is said to have been for lCO.0O0. entered Into by an English company, which reinsured much of the risk In other concerns. The Asheville (N. C.) Citizen says: "The thing of swapping pistols Just before golrg to prayer meeting should not become prev alent among tho people unless It is desired to depopulate the country. Down in South. Carolina two men were examining their guns with a. iew to swap Just before set ting.out for prayer meeting. One pistol was accidentally discharged, one of the men was killed, nnd the attendance upon tho meeting w.a lessened. There Is a weighty moral to this story." Sir Henry Hawkins was once presiding over a long, tedious nnd uninteresting trial, and was listening, apparently with gre.it attention, to a ery long winded speech from a learned counsel. After a white he mado a pencil memorandum, folded it, and sent it by the usher to the Q. C. in question, who. unfolding the paper, found these words: "Patience competition. Gold medal. Sir Henry Hawkins; honorable mention. Job." When a child ot 5 John Wanamaker as sisted In making bricks, getting a few cents a day. His first step toward fortuna was in the days when, as office boy, he saved money enough to start In business for him-elf. He worked as assistant in the office until he had climbed up to $6 a week. and then, seeing that he could get no more, he bought a little stock of cheap furniture and started to be a merchunt. Oran. In Algeria, has a port health officer still in active service at the age ot 128 years. His name Is Tremoulllet; he wa3 born in 1771: was captured by Oran pirates, in 17S9. and has neer left the town sines. He married an Arab woman, but, accord ing to the London Morning Post, "has re adopted European costume, and In spite of his great age has quite an elegant ap pearance." It is rather surprising to discover from the internal revenue statistics that the South has far fewer saloons In proportion to Its population than have tho Northern states. Arkansas, for example, has1 but 64? and Mississippi only 326. Two or three wards In New York or Chicago would probably exceed either figure. Mme. Rety. who under her maiden name ot Amelle Faivre was the original Slebel In Gounod's "Fauat," has Just died in Par is. Her husband for many years wrote the musical criticisms for Le Figaro over the signature "Charles Darcours."
