Chicago appears to have an ordinance to stop overcrowding, but it is defective in that it fails to define clearly what an overcrowd is. A new ordinance has been prepared, and Mayor Dunne, believing that the city transportation problem is no longer a question of public comfort but ot public danger, is urging its immediate passage. It is expected that Councils will pass the measure this week. To prevent over crowding, the ordinance limits the number ot passengers a car may carry to one and one-half times its seating capacity. It also provides that the platforms shall be kept clear. The Living Light.

Traffic Incident of the Anolcnt Custom of Carrylnir Fluinbeau* at Featlvala Origin of the Phrase, "Holding a Candle to Yon." There was a panic of a curious origin about the beginning of tlie eleventh century. It was widely believed that the year 1000 would witness the end of the world, and this superstition caused a very general stagnation of industry aud commerce. Such panics have oc curred at irregular lntervuls ever since, the last one being within the memory of the present generation and Inspired by Mother Shipton's prophecy: The world to an end shall come In eighteen hundred olghty-one. However, as soon as people became convinced that the world was not real ly going to come to an end in the year 1000, they resumed their work and play, and the making of lamps and candlesticks, like other manufactures, entered upon an era of prosperity. Monasteries were famous schools fui this work, as for all other forms of handicraft, and paid peculiar attention to the beautifying of lamps and can dlesticks because of their usefulness In church services. During the eleventh century Dlnaut, In Belgium, became famous for its copper work, and some of the most beautiful chandeliers of this period were made there. At about this time the "couronue des lumleres," or circle of lights hung from the cell ing, became a common device for light ing a church, and somo of these are oxquislte works of art. In this period, too, various devices for improving and shielding the light came into use. Our ancestors were very practical people, and If some of their utensils appear to us somewhat singular It is because we do not under stand the purpose for which they were used. It is rare Indeed to find any cumbersome addition to a lamp or candlestick which has not its use. The old time silversmiths and copper work ers did not spend their strength on mere decoration. The sconce and the lantern were in general use throughout the middle ages. The sconce was a light covered and guarded from the wind, lifted down by a handle, and distinct from the lantern, serving somewhat the snino purpose, but hung by a chain. Lanterns in the thirteenth century were made of gold, silver, copper or , Irou, according to the means of the owner. The light In them was shield- 1 ed from the wind by thin sheets of horn. Lantern making was an impor tant industry in Paris. At this time, too, noblemen and rich merchants took to having luxurious little traveling equipments made for them, and among these wero traveling candlesticks and wash basins in this fine enameled work, the secret of which Is now lost. The custom of having servants carry flambeaus at festivals also bocame general about this time, and a strange and tragic incident Is connected with this fashion. At a ball given by Charles VI. the torches carried by some careless servants came too near the headdresses of certain persons dressed as savages and set them on fire. The unfortunate guests were burned to death, and the king at the sight lost his reason, a madness which had a serious effect on the history of France. Magic lanterns were invented In the time of King Francis I. A device on a somewhat similar plan was used as a sign before shop doors to attract cus tom. Lamps fell Into disfavor at the begin ning of the seventeenth century and were used only by the poor and In pas sages and stables where the smoke could evaporate and a great deal of light was needed. Candles had then reached their perfection and candle sticks their most exquisite form. A candlestick of crystal given by Louis XIV. to La Valllere is still in existence, and It was at this time also that the crystal pendants came Into fashion. Street Illumination was not seriously attempted in Paris until about the mid dle of the seventeenth century. In the first years of that notable century the streets of Faris were dark. The rich were escorted by lackeys bearing torches, the middle class folk picked their way, lantern In hand, while the poor slid along, feeling their way by the walls. In his edict of September, 1U(»7, the king provided that candles In closed In a cage of glass should be hung by cords at the height of the first story of the house, three lanterns for every street, one at each end and one in the middle. At the sound of a bell, struck by a watchman, they were lighted. Paris was, however, considerably in advance of other cities of the world at this time. In London link boys stood about In public places calling out in lugubrious tones, "Gentlemen, a light!" The origin of the phrase "holding the candle to you" is somewhat doubtful, but some authorities trace it to the fact that, as the small light stand had not yet been devised, any one who de sired to read in bed had to have a ser vant stand beside him to hold the can dle. One cannot imagine that reading In bed under these circumstances would be very enjoyable, certainly not to one who had been accustomed to sol itude and a gas Jet easily turned on or off, but there is everything In habit- Gas Logic. They Love Dante. A magnificent upper chamber of the municipal palace (the Talazzo Vecchlo) In Florence 1r set apart In memory of the great poet Dante. To it each of the sixty-nine provinces and all of the lar ger cities and towns of united Italy have contributed a banner In his hon or. There are over 800 of these ban ners in all, and the donors. In eager emulation, have tried to make each of fering more beautiful than the others. The banners are of the differing colors of the provinces aud bear their arms lu exquisite embroidery or in paintings by the first living artists. The fervor of the homage paid here to the Immor tal Itallnn poet stirs the heart of even the passing Rtranger.

An enormous number of un stamped letters are posted every your. No record is kept of the exact number.

The president discusses many of the questions which are today be fore the country and it is improbable that congress will enact into laws all the rocommendatious he makes. Upon the subject of lynching he makes son e very sensible observations, and if his ideas are adhered to, aud his counsel fcAkeu, there is no reason why lynchii g should not become a thing of the jiast. aud one of the darkest blots on our civilization erased. On this question as witli the others with which the message deals the president's remarks are for the perusal of his countrymen at large as well as for their, chosen representatives. This is apparent in his remarks concerning capital and labor,wherein he takes occasion to ad-, minister a few hard raps to preachers of discontent, "The men who seek to excite violent class hatred against all men of wealth." His words on this subject should be carefully pondered. On the subject of the regulation of corporations, the president gives con gress to understand that Its work was not completed when the railway rate bill, the pure food bill aud the beef packing bill were passed. The passago ; of these measures simply marked an important advance iu the proper direc- j tion, but he does not urge immediate legislation on the subject. He, how ever, at cousiderable length, tells of | the enforcing aud actual working of the laws that have beeu passed. The feature of the message which will doubtless elicit the most comment and perhaps criticism is that relating to an inheritance and income tax. The president goes on record as favoring both, although on this subject, as on that of the regulation ot corporations, ho does not urge immediate action on the part of congress. It will be timo enough "when next our system of taxation is revised." Iu the mean time, he gives us something to think about. On the question of marriage and divorce, the president hints at a con stitutional amendment so that the matter may bo uealt with by congress iustead of by tho variou States, with the resultant differences in the laws aud the scandals and abuses. In the matter of the subsidy shipping bill which passed the senate lash spring,ho urges its passage by tho house at this session. He also earnestly recommends changes in our currency laws so that some very serious defects may be remedied, and Mo is equally emphatic in urging the passage of a lower tariff for the Philippines and the conferring of American citizenship on the Porto Hi cans. j)Those people who over six years ago were wont to say that Theodore Roose velt was impetuous aud would pre cipitate this country into war at the first opportunity, ought to read what lie says about our relations with the Japanese. In dealing with this delfc ato question he displays diplomacy and statesmanship of tho highest order, and his recommendations ought to be speedily ouacted into law by congress. On tf 10 subject of Cuba, tho Rio con -1 forenco, our foreign relations and var ious domestic problems not already enumerated,tho President writes most interestingly. His views on all public questious are sound and if congress will but heed his advice.and enact in to law the recommendations he makos, we will advance to a higher plane than we havo yet attained. THE 

NEWSPAPER FOR ALL. Tho McKeesport News makes some remark which everybody ought to be acquaiutod with,but which some have yet to learn: "Tho uowspaper is for everybody and hencO must publish something for everybody. If you see something which is of little interest to you,remember that there are others aud that the entire paper is not print ed especially for you. The very thipg that is dull aud uninteresting to you may bo the oue thing in the paper for some other readers. There are whole pages in the daily papers that are of no interest to some, but they are to others." It is very true that a news paper which tried to please every read er in every item it contained would sonu have very few readers. HELP THE CLERKS. Iu some of the cities the frieuds of the shop clerks are engaged in a con certed effort to presuado the general i public to do its shopping early in the . month. Iu New York the wives of the 1 labor unionists are being systematical- j ly asked to make their purchases not later tliau the 15th. The idea is to give j the clerks a little less stieuuous time during the last tou days of the pre -Iml iday season, and it is a splendid j ono. Can it bo imitated to any extent; in Dauville?

George Maxwell writes of them: "There Is little doubt that al most every one hiu u peculiar sensa tion of the almost godlike beauty, pow er, activity and strength of a tiger. A tiger will overawe and make conscious of his inferiority a man who would be unaffected by the bulk of an elephant. The feeling Is, however, elusive qf de scription, and I can perhaps best ex plain It In the words.of a most cliaffei Ing French gentleman who was once manager of a great tin mining com pany In Perek. We had Just finished luncli when he eutered In a state of tremendous excitement. Walking alone and unarmed along an unfrequented bridle pnth through the forest, he had walked almost onto a tiger. "lie gave us a most vivid narrative of the encounter—how the tiger had been lying down concealed In some long laiang grass beside the path; how he was within ten yards of It before he saw It; how then It rose and looked at him; how It yawned at him; how It then walked slowly across the pnth In front of him and then stopped and looked at him, again yawning, and how It then deliberately walked away into the forest, whose depths finally hid it from view. "Some one asked the Frenchman whether It wss a big tiger. He an swered: 'Well, messieurs, I cannot say If he Is a big tiger. My eyes see that he Is big, but I cannot say how see him to be, and If I say how big' It is perhaps that I tell you a He. But I can tell you, messieurs, how big I feel him to be, and I can tell you the truth. When he Is standing there In front of me I tell you that I feel he Is not less than thlr-r-ty feet high.'

The Salvellnus fontinalls, which Is j currently but Inaccurately called trout, was supposed for many years to be a small fish. Agassis was largely 1 instrumental in exploding this fallacy. I It Is not an uncommon thing for an I angler with ordinary luck to get a six I or seven pound trout of this variety. I It Is known that a trout may grow to weigh eleven or twelve pounds. Tliere Is, however, great difficulty in account-, ing for its variation in sice. I In northeastern Canada there are i large streams aud lakes In which only* | flngerlings have ever been found.*' Id' | the immediate vicinity of such water three and four pound trout are common, and seven and eight pounders are not phenomenal. In all these wa ters Crustacea do not abound; there are no small fish of any kind except small trout. All the fish are pure fly feeders*? At some places. It is true, frogs nboupd, but, taken as a whole, the difference iu food supply is not an adequate expla* nation for the difference in growth. There Is no substantial difference in the waters as to temperature, size, oi'U gin and course. Climatic conditions are the same. The small trout taken to; virgin lakes In which there are no flsh have sometimes grown to a great size, have sometimes remained small an<l sometimes have not thriven. The an-.- glers who haunt these waters have not''; yet found a satisfactory explanation of this peculiar condition of thingq. It' is one of the mysteries which l*nd fascination to the art.

If there Is any man on this earth, white or black, who insists that his? expenses In competitive sport must be no drain on himself, that man Is the Britisher. And he is quite right. An amateur should be neither in nor out a dollar. It is entirely proper that his'! club, his college, his association or such collection of bodies as he represents should pay his legitimate expensed ' when he is sent to compete for that college or club or association or union. England goes much farther and give* much more latitude in the matter of expenses than wo do. In example, "amateur" players in England whose services are desired for -ttw eounty championship series are llteN' ally "found" during the entire soasen. No graft of this kind could America without raising such a atorm as would blow the whole things kingdom come. Nor would we toler ate the conditions that obtain in Eng lish track athletics and "amateur" foot ball, both of which are of the English game.
