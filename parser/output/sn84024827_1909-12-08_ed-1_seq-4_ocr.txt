The message of President Taft was '-read to congress this morning. "Econ . omy In expenditure and sufficiency of revenue- Is the most important. . question 'confronting tnc present ad .. ministration In the opinion of the C president. Concerning the tarifT he . says 'that nothing more ought to be " dono along that line, until the tarirf commission presents reliable data suf ficient to guarantee Intelligent action. J The' president notes the increase In the cost of living, but denies that this - Increased burden is the result of, the "recent tariff bill. The president says that the people desire -postal' savings baulks and fur ther says that these banks would bo a good substitute for guarantee bank deposit' law3 which he regards as do- moralizing to conservative banking. However, he stops short of a -specific endorsement of the portal banks. The message is lacking in vigor and ' there are no reforms recommended which will attract any special attea vjion. except, perhaps, where he recom , mends legislation which will effect ' the future issuance of Injunctions by -United States courts, calling for a law , which will give to a defendant a rea sonable chacco to be heard before an 1 '.injunction shall be issued, but here f- makes numerous exceptions. Tllb president recommends that Ari- j zona and New Mexico be admitted as I(:e, and that the success he has separate states, in accordance with fhleved In the past augurs well for the future development under his ad the declaration of tho last republican mjnistraUoa of l branches of tho national, convention. In this coanec- tion heTecommends that the constitu tion be adopted only after an approv- al of the people of the territories. This recommendation Is not clear as no state has ever had a constitution put into effect until after Its approval by tho neonle. It has teen confidently 1 expected that the president would re commend the statehood bill ever since .his recent visit to the territory. He " could not omit this -In the face of the 1 - declaration of his party, besides it is known that President Taft desires ;that the two remaining territories W J?added to the sisterhood of states. f. While the president stands pat on the present tariff bill and on the prin ciple of protection, he puts that ques tion far in the future by the state ment that It will require the now tar iff board, or commission, several years to complete the labor assigned them and declares until that work Is completed nothing further should be undertaken in the way of tariff legist lation. The' president promises a special message to congress in which he will make recommendations regarding the further conservation of the natural re sources of the country, lcaludlag wat erways, reclamation, irrigation, ro-i foresting, etc. It may be assumed that the60 recommendations will tc favor aBlo'io the growing west.

GENERAL BELL WILL RETIRE In the month of April next General Bell, tho presont chief of etaft In the war department, will" leave that posi tion to bo filled by another. There are several applicants lor this high military position, but General Arthur Murray, present chief or coast artil lery, is said to be well In the' lead .for tho position. He has been a close friend of tho president since Mr. Taft was at the head of the war depart a.4nL The appointment or Goneral Murray it .be chief .of .staff of thearay would bu most pleasing to Arizona. He Is. a brother of Mrs. Judge Doan, who sf present Tesldos at Douglas. He vls Itsd.' Arizona and is acquainted with IM conditions and military needs of the country along the border. Judge Evan has already written to General Murray about the ambition of Doug It bto secure the border pest proppsed for this section of Arizona, and should ho become the advocate pf the o3tab Jshment of a military iost near Douglas that would bo a powerful ',n- tftcco In our favor, whetner Rp&eral Muray Is miide chief of staff or not. Concerning tho probabilities as to ic naming of a new chief of staff toj tho army by President Taft In April next, a Washington correspon lent of tho New York Tribune sends tht following to that papert That General Arthur Murray, chlei of coast artillery, will be the choice st tho President as successor to Gee eral j. 'Ffanfilln Bell as chief of staff hen the latter's term of duty ends next April, is the predlctlqn oftaany veil posted officers In the war de partment. The choice of a successor to General Bell Is a topic of the ut most interest to officers who realize that la large measure tho welfare of the" army depends on the ability of the" individual assigned to 'this' impor tant post. "Tho officers regarded as most cer-' tain to be seriously- considered are General Leonard Wood, commanding the department of the east; General William H. Carter, commanding tho department of Luzon; General Wil liam W. WItherspoon, assistant chief of staff, and General Murray. "Thoso who believe General Mur ray will probably be chosen point to the' fact that not only did ho enjoy closo and pleasant relations with the, president when he was secretary of war, but that he possesses to a re markable degree the faculty of ob taining desirable army legislation from Congress, and that with high technical attainments he combines the ability to get along without friction with all his associates In the war de partment. General Murray, It 'nlll be recalled, wa3 almost solely responsi ble for the passage by congress of the army pay bill, and so successful has he proved In obtaining appropriations for his own department that there has been some small degree of jealousy of the coast defense corps. Those who advocate the selection of Gen eral Murray say taht as chief , of staff his sympathies would be catholic, that jit would be Incumbent on him to de vote his energies to the proportionate' development of every arm of the ser- IniHtary establishment." Commentlng on tho probabilities of a new chief of staff for 'the army the jf511 Post " tha '"Dowlns: I Friotion may dev uop between Pres!dent Taft . Secretary of War Dickinson over the appointment of .a successor to General J". Franklin ce" a3 cn,el sla"- " s not iiKoiy, however, t be of much consequence, as the secretary Is expected to defer to the "clshes of the president. "President Taft is said to favor General Arthur Murray, chief of the coast artillery, for the place, while Secretary' Dickinson Is desirous of having General William H. Carter, at present In the Phlllpplnse, as his chief adviser, for that is what the chief of staff really Is. General Murray has been a close friend of the president ever since the latter was secretary of war, while General Carter and Sec retary Dickinson have known each other for years. Besides, General Carter practically made the plans un der which the staff was organized. "It has been said by officials at the war department that the contest has now narrowed down to these two men. General Leonard Wood, the ranking officer of the army, and Gen eral Clarence Edwards, head of the bureau of Insular affairs, are still within the possibility, however, of be ta gappolnted. But it was said that it is unlikely that either will be ap pelated unless there bo real friction over the appointment of General Car ter or General Murray."

Meantime the Increase In wages has been small ami the increase In sal aries has been still smaller. And 1 since, thp increase in pay has not been nearly so large as tho increase in the cost of living, how have the masses adapted themselves to the new sltua-Mess Uon? The answer is plain. They have simply and necessarily lowered the standard of living. The matter of in come is, after all, measured by what the income will buy, not by its defin ition In dollars and cents. The in comes of the masses will not begin to purchase now what they did ten years ago, nor what they did two years ago; but unless there Is a check in the en croachments of organized greed, they still purchase more "than they will hereafter. The greatest of all factors in the Increase of the cost of living is the protective tariff. The protective tar- ff, in its extreme abuses, is also tho chief cause of the concentration of wealth. And aside from the general suffering that arises from the inequit able distribution of wealth through the tariff protected trusts and the conditions they create .this concen tration of wealth is the greatest of all menaces to the political security of the nation. Kansas City Times (Kep). The people of Cochise county owe it to themselves to move the county seat away from Tombstone. If tho county seat was located here in Bis bee "the great saving to -the conn ty would amount to many thousands of dollars each year. The public build ings at Tombstone are inefficient and will soon have to be replaced. The people of the county will never con sent to the expenditure of any more money at Tombstone, unless for some trivial repairs. The people of the county should begin now the work of preparation for moving the county seat If the shortest way is to have the present county seat removal law amended then agitation for that should be started nd kept up. -., What Is the matter with Delegate Cameron? We note that the statehood bill for Arizona has been introduced by Chairman Hamilton, of the com mittee on territories.
