A dozen years ago such a suggestion as to copy American methods would have added to the gayety of Europe.

During the past three years the Socialists liave practically controlled the city gov ernments of Haverhill and Brocton, in Massachusetts. At the election last Tues day the Socialist party was repudiated in both cities as the result of a full vote and of limited experience. Socialism is a line topic for a speech, but in practice it is doomed to failure, even when the less radi cal of its ideas are tried. The "Woman's National Indian Society," vith headquarters in Uoston, has voted to eliminate the word women from the title- and to admit men to membership in th organization. Now watch the men tumble over each other in their haste to become members. They will all be anxious to cneek the nefarious purpose of the Indian tommi.-sioner to make the red man work for a living. The New York World says the endeavor of the President to lift all national ques tions above narrow partisanship "has low ered the temperature of debate." That is, the manner in which the FreM.Ient treated public questions has not roused partisan passion, but has been followed by ti ni perate criticism and fairness. If Congress could follow the Trci-ident'.s example: and thu'j lower the temperature of debate the country would bo pleased. i A statistician in Germany has been look ing up tho faets relative to divorce and sul- ela. lie fuuiul that out of a million per- pomi CIS divorced women committed ssuleide to CI married women, and that OS married trteu committed suicide, compared with divorced men who ended life by thcirjowu Lands.

1'IIII.IC OPINION. A spirited discussion is g'.dng on in New Y'ork over the proposition to so change the excise law that saloons may be legally open a part of Sunday for the sale of beer and wine. Under the Raines law any house having a given number of beds is a hotel and may k-H liquors to guests. Very natur ally, the Haines hotel is a synonym for a low groggery. During the administration of Mayor Strong an effort was made to close all the saloons on Sunday. The op position aroused was one of the causes of the return of Tammany, to power in 1S07. Since that time no effort has been mad2 to close the saloons on Sunday. Mayor elect Low and the new county attorney, Mr. Jerome, are in favor of a law that will legalize. the sale of wine and beer during a portion of Sunday. Bishop Potter and many other conservative men who are ear nest reformers, advocate the same policy. Perhaps the most zealous advocate of the proposed change Is the Itev. Dr. Rainsford, who led the crusade a few years ago against vice In the Tenderloin district and furnished the evidence which implicated the leaders of Tammany in a conspiracy to shield vice and crime by sharing the profits with the keepers of such places. In a recent interview Rev. Dr. Rainsford said: I am opposed to the saloon?. I wish I could shut them all up; but it is simply nonsense, the worst sort of nonsense, to believe that in a city which, next to Ber lin, is the greatest German city in the world, we can shut up the saloon on Sun day. This is the deliberate judgment of a man of positive and even radical views, who has had the courage to assail the stronghold of vice in New Y'ork city. For what he has done he is more hated by those who profit by vice and crime than any other man in the city. He fought the battle courageous ly, but in doing so ha3 come to the con clusion that in the interest of public mor als it is better to legalize saloons on Sun day than it is to have them operated in defiance of law; better to license them under stringent regulations which will compel decency than to ignore them and allow them to become brothels. "If you legislate ahead of the public conscience you defeat your ends," is the deliberately expressed judgment of Dr. Rainsford. The enforcement of law under our form of gov ernment depends largely upon public senti ment. An unpopular law can be enforced for a season, but at the next election the law will either be changed or officers will be elected who will not enforce it. In the opinion of a large number of intelligent men who desire the best things in govern ment, laws affecting the public morals should not be more strenuous in their pro visions that the average public opinion or conscience will sustain. It is the judgment of many of the most thoughtful observers that one of the most dangerous tendencies of the times Is disre; gard for law. Statute books contain a great many laws which have come down to us from remote times when lawmakers bor rowed their ideas regarding what laws should be from the letter of the Old Testa ment rather than from the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount. Some of these laws have been practically repealed by being treated as obsolete, and would be forgotten did not some revengeful lawbreaker in voke them for a few days to punish his persecutors?. There are other laws, how ever, which the en tiro community know to be violated with impunity. To this violation of law and the evils growing out of it, Rev. J. dimming Smith, pastor ef the Taber nacle Church, of this city, called attention in his Thanksgiving sermon. He referred to the violation of the license law in this city, and, in effect, declared that the effect of the knowledge of the violation of the liquor laws Is more to be deplored in the consequent disregard for law than the vio lation of the law itself. He also had the courage of his convictions and expressed the opinion that in order to have the liquor traflic under control of law, the adoption of the Swedish system, under which the government practically directs the sale of intoxicants, was desirable. The Tabernacle preacher does not favor this plan because he is in favor of liquor-drinking, for, if he could havo his way, he would put an end to the practice. Unfortunately, ho cannot have his way; furthermore, lie recognizes the fact that a large part of mankind In dulge in intoxicants and that the desire to indulge cannot be cured by legislative en actment. Under such conditions he would labor to convince men of the evils grow ing out of the use of intoxicants and place the? traffic under such reasonable legal re strictions that it will inflict the least injury upon society. To him a general disregard of a few laws will lead to the disregard or disrespect of all laws, and that leads to anarchy. Men who courageously and thoughtfully take this position are sure of being denounced by other men who. unfor tunately, cannot or will not consider any important question in all its bearings. Tili: TENACITY OP HACK. Ths Prussian government, after its very thorough manner, has been working many years at the task of Germunizing the Poles. The people whose country bore the name of Poland still cling to the national lan guage and customs as tenaciously as when the country was "partitioned" among its neighlors under the pretense of tranquiliz irtg Europe. At the present time the grown Poles are prevented from holding meetings as Poles, and the publication of newspa pers in the Polish language is forbidden'. Prussia Is also trlng to educate Polish children as Germans, but with indifferent succ ss, because the father and mother in culcate Polish traditions before the hi!d conns in contact with the German school teacher. Just now" Germany is having trouble in the schools In a Polish district. Germany decides what the child shall be taught, and attendance is compulsory. The government decided that religious instruction .should be givn. The .state religion is Lutheran, but the Poles are Catholics. The result is that tho children Live no heel to the religious teael Inc. tellimr tho teachvr that they are Pules and not Germans, and do not want to be taught tho "German religion." A teacher whipped Polish children in the school in Wrcschcn ln-cause they would not be taught the national religion. Thertupon the parents broke hi i:on the school exer cises, made a disturbance, were arrested and sent to prison to the numbt r of twenty-live. The disturbance has spread in the Polish section of Prussia and towns are resisting the school regulations and other wise offering opposition to German author ity. Germany is making an attempt to make a Grman of the Pole in the beim mat when the change shall be wrought there will be no Polish inlluence to intrigue and agitate for the old Polish nationality. The Pole understands this and refuses to bo made a German. There is no hope for the restoration of Poland. Doubtless the Polish leaders understand it, yet a national sen timent which is only a remembrance to the present generation i3 fiercely alive in Prussia, Russia and Austria. The con tention will doubtless break up the empire of Austria-Hungary Then the present Em peror shall die, but whether Germany or Russia undertakes to rule the Poles they will have a difficult task, since there is a Polish race, a Polish history, a Polish lan guage and a war-like people to perpetuate all. Great Britain's rule over Ireland haa been less arbitrary than that of Germany over its portion of Poland, yet the war of races is continued. Even with an almost forgotten lang-uage the Irish people keep alive their traditions of nationality to which they yet hopelessly aspire, and will resent British rule, be it never so mild, so powerful Is the influance of race. 

IIA1LHOADS AMI COAL llOAUS. Indiana is now so gridironed with rail roads and this city has been a railroad cen ter so long that it seems almost Incredible that there are persons living who can re member when there was not a mile of rail road in the State. Any person seventy years old or past can recall that period. The system had its first beginning on paper in 1SC1, but It wa3 several years after that before there was a mile of operating road in the State. In that year six railway lines were chartered by the Legislature to ex tend from different points, mainly on the border of the State to Indianapolis. They were the Lawrenceburg & Indianapolis, the Madison & Indianapolis, the New Albany, Salem & Indianapolis, the Harrison Sc. In dianapolis, the Lafayette & Indianapolis and the Ohio &. Indianapolis. During the next four or five years considerable money was spent in surveying and grading por tions of these lines, but only one of them, the Madison, was partially completed by 1S3G. In that year thi internal improvement mania led the State to embark in railroad building. By 1SU the Madison road had been completed with a flatbar to Vernon, and it was several years before it got any farther. In it was leased to a Madison syndicate for CO per cent, of its receipts, and in IS 12 it was sold to a new corporation and was completed to this city in 1517. For several years it was the city's only railroad and the only outlet and inlet between the central portion of the Slate and the river. For a few years it did a great business, though financially embarrassed. In IS32 its stock sold for $1.C0 and in 1S5G it had sunk to 2j cents on the dollar. This slump in the stock was due to extravagant manage ment and the growing rivalry of new lines. In March, lSt)2, the entire road was sold by the United States marshal for $C23,(mX). The Jeffersonville road, which was not one of the pix chartered In 1SC1, was begun in 1S4S, completed to Edinburg in 1S52, reaching In dianapolis from Edinburg over the track of the Madison road. The old Bellefontaine road, now the Bee-line division of the "Big Four," was chartered in ISIS, opened from Indianapolis to Pendleton in 1SÖ0 and to Union City in 1S.12. The Vandalia, original ly called the Tcrre Haute & Richmond, was chartered iu ISIS and completed iu 1SC2. Tho present generation will scarcely believe that there was no direct railroad connec tion between Indianapolis and Cincinnati until IsjI, but such Is the fact. Prior to that the favorite route was by rail to Madi son and from there by river to Cincinnati. The original charter of the Lawrenceburg Indianapolis road, granted in 1SC1, lapsed and a new one was granted several years later. The building of a road to Cincinnati was fought by the Madison interests with vicious determination and was doubtless delayed several years on that account. It was finished from Indianapolis to Law renceburg in and the next year, by means of an "accommodation rail" over another roadbed connection was made with Cincinnati. The Indianapolis & La fayctte road was begun in and finished in 1S32. The Indiana Central, now a part of the Panhandle system, was organized in 1SC1 and completed to the eastern State lino in 153. The Peru &. Indianapolis, chartered in lb 10, was finished as far as Xoblesville with flatbar In 1"1 and to lVru in i It was not equipped with T rail until after Its completion to Peru. The Indianapolis Cincinnati Junction, now the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton read, was begun in di visions between Hamilton and this city in lS"i, but was not completed to this point un til 1m'. It is one of two roads that te ceived a subsidy from the city, it having received $15,000 and the Yincennes road $00, 0J0, both en condition that their shops be located here. The Vinccnncs road was fin ished to this point in The old Indian apolis, Woomington t Western road was opened in 1SC7 and the old Indianapolis & bt. Louis In is,G;. 1 rom the foregoing it appears that nearly all tho railroads now entering the city were constructed duiinj the twenty years from 1S10 to ly.'ü. Severa of them traverse the coal fields, but for some reason or other the problem of cheap coal has not yet been solved. There is n coal in the world so easily accessible and so cheaply mined as Indiana coal, and none better for making steam on account of Its freedom from sulphur and its burning with out coking. Situated as Indianapolis is with reference to the coal field, it should have had cheap coal long ago, and woult have had if any nr." of the railroads which traverse the real full had treated the citv as liberally as tiny were treated by it Wb.at the city needs now is cheap transpor tation. There is not another city in the United States located as near Inexhaustible fields of coal that can be cheaply mined but F.ets cheaper e-.al than this city does. The lesson of the past is -that mere multiplicity of railreads to er through the coal region Is no guaranty of cheap coal. There mu be a distine tive. ceal road or a road through the coal field pledg.-d to be managed in the interest of the eity. The School Board is wise in calling a hal In the collecting cf money from the dudIIs of the public schools. No fault can bo found, perhaps, with asking the children to contribute to the Harrison and McKinley memorials, but now that this has been done the line should be drawn ami no fur ther demands made on them. The rule against such collections was formerly ob served with much strictness, but within the past few years it has been broken sev eral times, and the tendency has been toward laxness in regard to it. Many teachers object greatly to making such re quests of their pupils, knowing as they do what a struggle it is for many parents to keep their childern properly clothed and equipped for school. In such families every penny counts, and when the desired contribution is withheld the child is sub jected to a humiliation and embarrassment which authorities should have made un necessary. Even a man or woman does not like to be put in a position where his or her poverty ia made apparent, and by a child such experiences arc borne with difficulty. The circular note which Superintendent Kendall has sent to teachers in the eighth grade anel high schools, suggesting to those who teach "current history, civics in the broad sense, and English," to make use of portions of President Roosevelt's message, is an innovation which can be heartily corn- mended. In his circular Mr. Kendall calls special attention to the portion of the mes sage devoted to the assassination of tho ate President McKinley, anarchy, the re striction of immigration, the forestry re serve and like topics. He proposes to ac complish three objects, namely to test the pupil's power to read, to give instruction in civics and current history, and as an ex ample "of the use of pure and forcible Eng lish." Teachers are cautioned against dis cussion cf controverted questions, such as the tariff. There is so little of this In the message that It can be made a study with out inculcating partisanship. There is rea son to believe that Mr. Kendall's novel sug gestion will be received with general favor. Chicago has a juvenile court over which Judge Tuthill presides. Under the law which established the court and its methods of procedure hundreds of boys who were sent to jail a few years ago are now taken care of by charitable organizations and In stitutions. Recently the Chicago Commer cial Club and Union League Club became Interested in this work, and a large sum of money is already pledged to establish a rural refuge for delinquent boys. This in stitution Is necessary to make the juvenile court law effective. The fact that under the juvenile court law only twenty-four boys have been sent to jail during the two years It has been in power, compared with 1,70" tent to prison tho three years just before its establishment, will give some idea of tho good work that law has made possible. A . prominent commission merchant and fruit dealer who is in a position to know whereof he speaks tells the Indiana Hor ticultural Society that in the last ten years $1.OX,0 ha3 been sent out of the State for arples. An average of 

ROOO.000 a year tent out of the State for a product that ought to be raised at home argues lack of enterprise or bad management. The fault is not in the soil, climate or natural con ditions, all of which, in a large portion of the State, are admirably adapted for fruit culture, ard especially for apple culture. It lies with the farmers and land-owners, who have allowed the early orchards to decay without renewing them. The situa tion is not a creditable one, and should not be allowed to continue. The annual meeting of the Indianapolis Charity Organization this evening in the English Oiera House will be devoted' to brief addresses by those who are connected with tho different institutions and organi zations devoted to the care and education of children who would be homeless but for these organizations. The subject is, per haps, the most important feature of 'charity effort, since, to tho extent that it Is suc cessful, those who would grow up to lives of dependence and worthlessness are cn listeel on the side of the self-supporting and the law-abiding. The rescue of children who would be vagrants or the inmates of poorhouses is the most effective war which can be made upon the 2 per cent, which constitute tho dependent and criminal classes. The report that the transcontinental railroads will not strive to prevent the passage of a Nicaragua canal bill seems not to be correct, as the companies are opposing the ratification of the Hay räuncefote treaty. Editor Bok explains laboriously and at the cost of much space in his excellent tamily magazine, that there are many ad vertisements for which he could get big money, but which, because they are not perfectly high class and proper, he simply refuses to publish. He then goes on to any that he mentions these facts merely to prove one thing, namely, that the Insertion cf illustrated corset advertising in his per iodical "is not based on financial consider ations. Right or wrong, it is lure because of an honest conviction of the department which governs such things that it should be there." In other words, corset ads are in because the coarse, vulgar business de partment which does not share the edi tor's delicate scruples considers that they are all right money no object, of course. What travail of soul the poor man musl endure every time he looks over the pages (f his magazine and allows his eyes to fall on those shocking pictures! A Cincinnati man writes to a paper of that city complaining that when for pa triotic purposes he went to a dinner given for a suitable price by the Daughters of tho American Revolution, his tenderest sen sibilities were shocked by seeing the Hag of tho free, the sacretl emblem of his coun try and theirs, hanging in the window up side down. "Will you kindly Inform me," he asks plaintively, "where one is to hok for reverence to the Hag if not to tho Daughters of the American Revolution, y t they hang the starry emblem wrong side foremost." This rash and dull-witted man probably did not stop to consider that the arrangement of the flag, of which he complains, was made on a basis of be comingness to some one under its folds. or nocause it seemed more arusin? in a reverse form. And what is mere custom or what one side ef a Hag rather than another when artistic effects are con cerned ? Mr. Henley's reevnt article on Robert Louis Stevenson Las stirred up a great rumpus among the admirers of the latter, and doubtless Mr. Henley was Indiscreet and displayed Kol taute; nevertheless, a good many persons who enjoy reading Stevenson's Works, but are not able to join In tho Immoderato adulation which has been heaped on him, will incline to the belief that the criticisms of him may have a good effect in bringing about a fair and just estimate of the man. As one writer put it: "The wise world will accept the candor of one friend as at least as valu able to the plain truth as the gush of his teo-heaellong aelmirers and quoters and shibboleth-mongers. For a long time it has been difficult for people who really admire Stevenson, but with sanity, to open their mouths." Senator Cullom's effort to secure from Congress an appropriation with, which to build a suitable memorial to Abraham Lin coln at the national capital should re ceive attention and approval. It is rather strange that no serious move in this direc tion has been made before. With the ac tivity displayed in the erection of statues and other memorials at Washington to per petuate the fame of a host of smaller men it would seem that a monument to honor the name of this great President would have had its foundation laid before now. Lincoln's fame needs no pile of stone to make it sure, but the country owes it to itself to offer proper tribute to his memory in the capital, where his services to the people were performed. A dispatch from a neighboring town, giv ing an account of a runaway marriage, asserts with unconventional frankness that "the two young people have been very attentive to each other for a long time." It is so much the custom to assume that all matrimonial overtures are made by the man in each case that, although every one knows the truth to be often quite other wise, It is rather startling to see the fact put so bluntly. "She" frequently "pays attention" ardently to the object of her choice, but the world chooses to regard her, when tho attentions culminate in mar riage, as the person sought for. If you see a professional-locking young man or woman gazing intently at you in the street cars or other public place do not be In haste to assume that they are admiring you. They may be studying your physiognomy and its lines as a guide to the "make-up" of the villain of the next play. That at least is the custom of many of the stage people when planning new parts, according to one actress lately in terviewed. New nickel coinage soon to be Issued in Belgium has each piece pierced to make them more convenient for business, the idea being that they will be strung like Chinese and Japanese money. Belgians should be warned to leave their strings of money at home when they come to this country. The punched nickels won't pars on the street cars. Vegetarians are not having their innings these days. At least they cannot advocate their diet on the score of its economy, for, though meats ure high, vegetables are also costly. The most practical course is that followed by the majority provide as large a proportion of each variety of food as you can afford, and so strike a balance. Tho "Holy Ghost and Us Society," a freak religious sect of Maine, is said to be sending a large number of missionaries abroad. Will somebody kindly advise them to go to Bulgaria, where there is a ele mand for missionaries with no preference for any special denomination? THE
