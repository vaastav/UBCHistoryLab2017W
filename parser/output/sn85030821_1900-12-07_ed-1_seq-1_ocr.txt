The president to-day transmitted his annual message to the Fifih.-si.xtu congress. The saii ent features are as follows: "With the outgoing of the old and the I Incoming of the new century you begin I the last session of the Fifty-sixth con- J gross with evidences on every hand of ' Individual and national prosperity, and with proof of the growing strength and Increasing power for good cf republican Institutions. Your country will Join with you In felicitation that American liberty is more firmly established than ever be fore, and that love for it and the deter mination to preserve ft. are more uni versal than at any former period of our history. The republic was never so strong, because never so strongly entrenched in . the hearts of the people as now. The constitution, with few amendments, .ex. lns as it left the hands of its authors. The additions which have been inatle to It proclaim larger freedom and more ex tended citizenship. Popular government has demonstrated In its 124 years of trial here its stability and security, and Its eSciency as the best instrument of na tional development and the best safe guard to human right3.

GLANCE BACKWARD. When the Sixth congress assembled In November, 1s.a, the population of the United States was 5,3-s,43. It is now 76.Ck-4.7y9. Then we had IS states. Now we have 45. Then our territory consisted cf S03.CS3 square miles. It is now 3.S4-5.5.-0 square miles. Education, religion and morality have kept pace with our ad-, vancement In other directions, and while extending its power tne government has adhered to its foundation principles and abated none cf them in dealing with our new peoples and possessions. A nation bo preserved and blesed gives reverent thanks to God and invokes His guidance and the continuance of his care and favor. THOUBLESOilE CHINESE PROBLEM. In our foreign intercourse the dominant Question has been the treatment ef the Chinese problem. Apart from this our . relations with the powers have been hap 'py. The recent troubles in China sprins from the anti-foreign agitation which for the past three years has gair.xl strength in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese j races and In the traditions of their gov ernment. Ihe Taiping rebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to foreign trade ; and settlement disturbed alike the homo- i geneity ana tne seclusion oiv,nina .yean- i wni.e foreign activity maue itsen ieu la all quarters, not alone on the coast. but along the great river arteries and ! in the remoter districts, carrying new ! ideas and introducing new associations among a DrimUive People Which had pur- I sued for centuries a national policy of j Isolation. The te'.egrapn and the raiiway spreading over their land, the steamer plying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating year attor year farther tcf the interior, became t tne Chinese mind types of an alien inva sion, changing the course of their nation al life and fraught with vague forebod ings of disaster to their beliefs and their self-control. The president then recounts the seri ous nprising' last spring1, the expedition of the joint allies to release the lega tions at Pekia and the subsequent eFentsin diplomacy and warfare. "The policy of the United States through all this trying period." he says, 'Svaa clearly announced and scrupulously carried out." lie discusses the various propositions that have been advanced to terminate the anomalous conditions and concludes: I regard as one of the essential factors cf a durable adjustment the securement of adequate guarantees for liberty ofj faith, since insecurity of those natives who may embrace alien creeds Is scarcely less effectual assaults upon the rights of foreign worship and teaching than would bethe direct invasion thereof. The mat ters of indemnity for our wronged citi zens is a question of grave concern. Meas ured in money alone, a sufficient repara tion may prove to be beyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur In emphatic disclaimers of any purpose j or aggranaizement tnrougn tne oismein- upon this supject m tne several states berment of the empire. I am disposed I is much to be desired. It Is to be hoped, to think that due compensation may be j that such uniformity, founded in a wise made in part by increased guarantees and just discrimination between what is cf- security for foreign rights and im- I injurious and what is useful and neces jnunities. and most important of all, by j sary In business operations may be ob the onening of China to the eoual com- tained. and that means may oe found for merce of all the world. These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by our representatives. The goveriment of Russia has put forward a suggestion, that i . e A-u-Anr rf nrntrartpd riivprpncp nf views in regard to indemnities the matter may be relegated to the court of arbitra- ; tion at '.he Hague. I favorably inch: to this, believing that high tribunal could not fail to reach a solution "no less condu cive to the stability and enlarged prosper ity of China itself than immediately ben eficial to the powers. 

ISTHMIAN CANAL LEGISLATION. The all-important matter of an inter oceanic canal has assumed a new phase. Adhering to its refusal to re-open the question of the forfeiture of the contract of the Maritime Canal company, which was terminated for alleged non-execu- tion in October. ISD, the government of Nicaragua has since supplemented that artion hv declaring the so-styled Erye- Cramin option void for non-payment of te stipulated advance. Protests in re lation to these acts nave been filed In state department and are under con- Uderation. Deeming ltseir relieved iron existing engagement?, the Nicaraguan government phows a disposition to deal freely with the canal question either in ihe way of negotiations with the United S-.ates or by taking measures to promote the waterway. Overtures for a conven tion to-effect the building of a canal un cir the auspices of the United States are under consideration. In the meantime the views cf congress upon the subject, ir;he light of the report of the commis si orr appointed to examine the compara tire merits cf the various trans-isth-tuan ship canai projects, may be awaited. I commend to the early atten tion cf the senate the convention with ir'reat. Britain to facilitate the construc-i-n of such a canal and to remove any er --rction which might arise out of the c- -vention cemmcniy called the Clayton I: :Ier treaty. rLCFERS TO SULTAN S PROMISES.

I rtcoinmend that the congress at Its present seion reouce the ir.ttrnal rev enue taxes imposed to meet the expenses of the war with s?p?.ln in the sum of U). '.0. ... This reduction should be secured by the remission of thse taxes which experience has shown to be the most bur densome to the ind!:tr:c-3 of the peopie. I specially urpe that there be Included in whatever reduction is made the legacy tax, bequests for pub. if uses of a literary, educational or charitable character. FOR THE 

MERCHANT MARINE. American vessels during the past three years carried about nine per cent, of our exports- and imports. Foreign ships should carry, the least, r.ot the greatest, part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our .tefei injustries. the rroirress of shipbuilding for the domestic trade, and our 6teaQiiy maintained expenditures for the navy have erf-a ted an opportunity to p;ace the Ur.rted States in the first rank OI commercial maritime powers. Besides rps!:7:ne- nrnwr n;t : -.r.r, 1 atr.iratinn tV.! will mean the establishment and healthy growth along all our coasts of a rfistinct- ive national Industry, expanding the eM for profitable employment of labor and I capita!. It will increase ihe transpor j tatior- facilities and reduce freight charg ! es on the vast volume of products brought from the interior to the seaboard for export, and will strengthen an army of the national defense upon which the founders of the government and their successors have reiied. In again urging immediate action by the coneress on measures to promote American shipbuild ing and foreign trad". I direct attention to the recommendations on the subject in previous messages, and particularly to the c' inion expressed In th message cf 1-3. It am satisfied ine judgment of the country favcrs the policy of aid to our merchant marine, which will broaden. cur commerce and markets and upbuild our sa-carrying caj acity for the products of agriculture and manufacture, which, with the increase of our r.avv, mean more work and wags to our countrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in ev erv part of the world. The attention of congr.s is Invited to the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury In his annual report for legislation in behalf of tho revenue cutter service, and favorable action Is urged. WOULD RESTRAIN TRUSTS. In my last annual message to the con gress 1 called attention to the necessity for early action to remedy Euch evils ai mis-ht be found to exist in connection with coTRblnations of capita! organized into trusts and again invite attention to j my discussion of the subject ! which concluded with these at that time. words: "It is apparent tha.t uniformity of legislation the congress, within the limitations of its constitutional power, so to supplement an effective code cf state legislation as to make a comniete svstem of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules towhich I have referred The whole cucstion i3 so important and far-reaching that I am sure no part of it will be iightly considered, but every phase of it will have the studied delib eration of the congress, resulting in wise ' and Jud!clous action. Restraint upon such f combinations as are injurious, and which are within federal jurisdiction should be promntlv applied by the congress. THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION. In my last annual message I dwelt at some ieegth upon the condition of affair in the Philippines. While seeirg to im press upon you tnat tne grave responsi- bility of the future government of those inlands rests with the congress of the United States. I abstained from recom mending at that time a specific and final form of government for t'ne territory ac tually held by the United States force; and m which as long as insurrection con tinues tr mi::tarv arm must uetriMiiii Ue supreme. 1 stated my purpose, until the congress shall have made known the formal expression ot its will, to vse th authority vested in me bv the constitution and the statutes to uph?id the sovereignty of the United States in those distant is lands as in all other places where our riag rightfully hosts, placing, to that end. at the disposal of the army a-d navy all the means which the liberality of the congress and the people have provided. No contrary expression of the will of the congress having been mane. I have stead fastly pursued the purpose so declared, employirg the civil arm as weii toward the accomplishment cf pacification ar.d the institution of local government within t ;-- n-ies of utTorfy and law. Bv the spring of this yer the effective exposition of the diss-s.l-d Tagais to j the authority cf the United States was virtu illy ended, .thus opening the rt-jc-r I fr the extension of a stable admin'rra- tion over much of the territory cf the Archipelago. rsirir,g to bring this about I appointed in Mrch laet a civil cenin:l sion ccmoo.sed of ih Hx.. William H. rrit iyir- Trr rif-an C? V.oroter. of 'i'lehirai.: 'lien. Luke E. Wright, ofj Tennessee: Ken. Henry C. Ide. of Ver-I mont, and Fxof. Bernard ioses, of Cali- J fc-mia. This commission, composed -of eminent I citizens reoreser tir.g diverse geo graph- f ical and political interests cf trie count- try. and bringing to their task the r:;e ( fruits of long and inteiiiger.t servi-re in 1 educational, administrative and judicial 'careers, has made grest rrcrrer-s from! the outset. As early f j August HI. 1 '. 1 it s-brr.itted a pre:iIr.ary rtport, which j wi'.i be lad2 fcfore the cor -s and frn ; at -i.;j.:t tre gc- rrfr re f--:: : t;u ' ger area is under scar cultivation than ever before; that the customs rcvennen are greater thin at any time during the Spar.i.-h rule; that economy and c-Sciency in the military administration have cre ated a surplus fund of Sj.j.' .'.. available for reeded r; lie improvements; that a Ftrlrger-.t civil service law is in prepara tion; that railroad communications are expar.img. orcnii.g up rich districts and that a comprehensive scheme of educa tion is bting organized. Later reports from th? commission show a yet more encouraging advance toward insuring the benerits of liberty and good government to the Filipinos, in the interest "of humanity and with the aim of hulldir.g up an enduring, self-supporting and self-administering communi-. ty in those far-eastern seas. I would im press upon the congress that whatever legislation may be inacted in respect to the Ph'.'.ipinne i-ianis should be " along these generous lints. The fortune of war has thrown upon this nation an un svugh; trust which shouirt be unselfishly discnarged and devolved upon this gov ernment a mjial is wtii as material re sponsit'iiitv tt-wnrd these millions whom we have fr-e-' f-om au onrresr:v- yoke. OUR OBLIGATION A3 GUAkLIAN. I h.ve upon anotlitr occasion called the Filipinos "the waris of the nation." Our obiigatioji as guardian was not light ly assumed; it must not be otherwise Than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit tho.e who have come under our fosieri-'-r care, it is our dutv to so treat them that our iiag may be no lccs be layed In the mountains of Luzon and th -fertile zons of .Mindanao and Negro 3 than it is at home, mat there as here it j 6hail be the symbol cf liberty, enlight t ment and progress in every avenue of . development.

He would be rash who, with the I teachings of contemporaneous history in J view, would fix a limit to the degree of i culture and aivanc-n:rht yet within the ; reach of those peopie if our duty toward mem be faithfully performed. LEGISLATION FOR PORTO RICO. The civil government of Pcrto Kico provided for by the act of the congress approved April LI. l.-.-j. is la successful operation. The courts have been es tablished. The governor and his asso ciates, working intelligently and harmo niously, are mt-e-tir.g with commc-ndable access. On the tth of November a gen eral election was he!d in the island for members of the lfgii.uture. and the body elected has been cai.ed to convene on the f.rst Monday of Lecernber. I reccom mend thai l gisiatlon be enacted by con gress conferring upon the secretary of the Interior su; ervision, ever the public lands in IVrto Ivico. and that he be di rected to ascertain the " location and quantity of lands the title to which re mained in the crown of Spain at the" date of cession of Porto Rico to the United States, and that appropriations necessary for -w-irveys be made. anj tnat lr;e methods cf the disposition of such lands be prescribed by law. CABLE TO HAWAII AND MANILA. I renew the re-commendation made in my spec.ul message of February 10. 1SI-9. as to the necessity for caoie communica tion between the United States and Ha waii, with extension to Manila. Since then circumstances have strikir.glv em phasized this m-ed. Surveys have shown the entire leasioiiity of a chain of cables which at each stopping place shall toucli on American te-riiory, so that tne sys tem shail be under our own complete con tre'l. Manila, once within telegraphic reach, connection with the systems cf the Asiiitic coast wouid open" increased ana pro -.ine opportunities lor a more direct cab'e route from our shores to the Orient than is row afforded bv the trans Athintie, continental and trans-Asian 'lines. I urge attention to this important matter. AN ARMY OF 110,000 MEN. The personal strength of the army Is l'.f.J men C".'.J regulars and 33am) vol unteers. Under the act of March 2. on the C".h of June next the personal volunteer force will b-? discharged and the regular army wijl be reduced t& 2. 447 ofiicers and fn.CC enlisted men. In lvn a board of ofhoers convened by Pres ident Cl.vland adopted a comprehensive .sch-me of cost dele-se fortifications which Involved the outlay of something over tl -"'.( .". The plan received the approval of the congress and since then regular appropriations have been made and the work "of fortification has steadily progressed. More than ? -!)..). '.'5 have been invested in a great number of forts and guns, with all the complicated and sci entific machinery and electrical appliance necessary for their use. The proper cart of this defensive machinery requires men trained in its use. The number of men necessary to perform this duty alone ascertained hy the war department at m. minimum allowance to be 15.4JO. There are C-j or more military posts in the Unit ed Spates other than the coast defense fortifications. The number of these posts is beinsr constantlv increased bv con gress. More than $J2.P":).C have be"n ex pended in building and equipment, and theysan only be cared for by the regular army. The pos now in existence and other to be bu 'it p-ovide for accommo dations for. ar.eL If fully garrisoned, re quire '! troops. Many of these posts are along our frontier or at important strategic points, the occupation of which Is necessary. We have in Cuba between 5.'") and G'T) troor?. For the present our troops in that island cannot be with drawal or materially diminished, and cer tainly not until the conclusion of the la bors of the constitutional convention now in session and a government provided by the new conctitution shall have been es tablished ae.d i; stability assured. In Porto r.:co we have reduced the gar risons to l.fl., which Include native trends. There i no room for further re duction he-e.

The secretary of the interior believes that by the operations of this act the number of persons pensioned un der it will increase and the increased annual pavment for. pensions will be be tween $3.(10.Cmj and $4.

FAVORS AX EIGHT-HOUR LAW. rn my annual message of December 5. 2 SI'S, I called attention to the necessity for some amendment of the alien con tract law. There still remain important features of the rightful application cf the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principles of arbitration, and I again commend these subjects ta the cartful attention of congress. CAUTION AGAINST EXTRAVAGANCE In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it Invites of extrava gance Ln government expenditures and appropriations; and the chosen represent atives cf the people will, I doubt not. furnish an example in their legislation of that wise economy which in a season of plenty husbands for the future.

BRECKINRIDGE REPORTS. The I 'fppctnr Grnri of the Army Sa$-g-t t Sandril of Two Soldiers pr l.OOOof Popaiatlea. Waphinprton, Dec. 5. The report of Gen. J. C. BrcckinridTe, inspector g-eneral of the array, earnestly recom meiuls thct the benefits of the law of March 3, 1S90, providing: for the re tirement of officers of the navy, under certain conditions, ivith the rank an3 pay of the next Lipher grade, be ex tended, to include olTicers of the army. 2Iost of our wars have been fought on land, says the report, and as a matter of simple justice rewards for array officers should be no les? extensive than these enj'oyed by ofdeers of the naval branch. He also touches rpon the disadvantages imposed by inferior rank in the army, citing- as" an in stance, the China campaign, when Gen. Chaffee, a junior amontr the in ternational commanders,- was ad vanceei from a brig-adier to a majer general to give him the rank requi site to hia status as - commander-in-chief of the United States" forces in China. Gen. Breckinridge also notes that the grade of brig-adier general is abolished in most of the European armies and is nearly as archajc as the rank o commodore afloat. .In reg-ard to the question of reor-gnnizirig- the standing- army, the" pen eral suggests a standard of two sol diers per every' 1.000 of population, arid submits statistics to show that in the proportion of soldiers" to popu lation. und to the area of the country, and in the war bndget in time of peace, the United States is far be hind all of the great European na tions.

PEOPLE LIVE LN LONDON. The Mght Population of the City Proper la Decreasing? Very . Rapidly. London city proper is losing the little popularity it once enjoyed as a place of residence. In 1S61 it had a population of 112,0CO; to-?ay it has but a quarter of that Dumber. These figures, cf course, represent the night population of the city those who sleep within the limits of the old city.' During the same time the day population those who do business or perform labor in the city, has increased. Ia 1S65 it was 170.- 133; in 1591, 301.334. Those who have walked across London bridge about nine .o'clock in the morning do net need to be told about the vast stream of humanity which flows cityward at that hour. But it 13 almost incredible that no fewer than 2.0GO.K3 persons eater the city during a single period of 24 hours. The ascertained number for 1S91 was 1.1S6.C34, and the succeeding ten years must have brought the figure up to 2.C-C3.000. One canoat help re gretting that the permanent popula tion should have sunk so low. No won- I der the numerous nd beautiful churches are so empty. The cjty is now little more than a congestion of ware houses and shops. The change is par ticularly noticeable in such streets as Bread street, where John Milton was born and the Mermaid tavern once flourished. But those were in the days when the green fields were near and Islington was a country suburb. Discoverer of Cape 5oat. The Cape Nome mining cajnp was discovered by a reindeer driver named Linderberg, in connection with a sail or deserter named Lindblom and a Michigan miner named Brintensen.

The annual re port cf Secretary of the Treasury Gage was submitted, to- congress yes erday. It is largely statistical and, contains much, that has already ap peared in the public press. The rev enues f the government from- all sources for the year ended June 30 were $653,505,431 and the expenditures $330,003,371, leaving a surplus of $7S, 527,00. The secretary advocates a conserratire reduction, of war revenue taxes. Concerning the present finan cial law he saysr Condence In the purpose and power of the government to maintain the gold standard has been greatly strengthened. Th result Is that gtild flows toward the treasury instead of away from it. That provision of the act which liberalised the conditions of baci note issues was also wise and timely. Under It, as previously hown In this report, there has been an Increase of some $77,000,000 In bank note Issues. To this fact may be chiefly at tributed the freedom from stress 'for currency to handle the large harvests of cotton, wheat and corn. Ia this respect the year has been an exception to the gen eral rule of stringency which for several years has so plainly marked tfTe autumn season. Nevertheless, the measures re ferred to. prolific as they have been In good results, will yet need reinforcement In some Important particulars. Thus, as to the redemption fund provided for In said act, while the powers conferred upon the secretary are probably ample to en able a zealous and watchful oScer to pro tect fully the geld reserve, there appears to be lacking sufficient mandatory re Cuirement to furnish complete onfldence in the coatinued parity, under all condi tions, between our two forms of metallic money. siivr and gold. Trpon this point further legislation may become desirable. As to the currency, while tha liberalis ing conditions have, as previously noted, found response in a necessary increase of bank note issues, there is under our pres ent system no assurance whatever that the volume of bank currency will be con tinuously respnrve to the country' needs, either by expanding as such needs require or by contracting when super fluous In amount. The truth 13 that, safs and desirable as Is our eurency system ln many respects. It Is not properly re lated. The supply of currency Is but remotely, if at all. Influenced by the ever changing requirements of trade and in dustry. It Is related most largely, if not entirely, to the price Cf government bonds In the market. Between the needs of trade and commerce for a medium of ex change and for Instruments of credit, which a proper bank note furnishes, and the Investment price or value of govern ment bonds, which is at present the most Influential factor In determining the cur rency supply, -there Is no tiiscernable re lation whatever. 

0LE0UARGARINE INDUSTRY. It la Orowlnc Wonderfully, According tat the C"mm!slonr of Internal Rcreon 51 8oorl and Sanaa Figure. Washington, Dec. 5. The annual re port of the commissioner of internal revenue contains some interesting as well as instructive information with relation to the revenue collected in the middle western states during the fiscal. year ended June 30, 1900. One third of the $295,316,107.57 collected from internal revenue sources throughout the entire country came from Illinois, Indiana and Missouri. Illinois heads the list. - Missouri came seventh, her people paying the federal government $1634,171.67. The re ceipts from Iowa were $1,S74,S03.87; from Kansas, $1,010,173.79. That the oleomargarine industry in the middle western states has grown wonderful ly in the last year is indicated by the report. The total production amount ed to 107,042,023 pounds, or an In crease over the preceding year of 24, 000,000 pounds, or 25 per cent. The internal revenue taxes on this article amounted to $2,543,755.13. Kansas produced 15.6?6,4G0 pounds, of which 16,332,323 pounds were consumed. Mis souri produced 4,107,635 pounds. riaabmd and Wife's Combined Earnlnc. Et. Louis, Dec. 5. In a decision rendered yesterday iq the case of J. I. Macks against the'Columbia Thea ter company and Sidney Drew, the St. Louis court of appeals declared that what husband and wife earn by their combined labors belongs to them jointly and cannot be considered the sole and absolnteproperty of the hus band. The conclusion, therefore, was that it cannot be applied to the hus band's iniividual debts and is sacred from the obligations of the. wife as well. "It "can only be taken In pay ment of the joint debts. Prdd b Cot. Plntrra. Detroit, Mich., Dec 5. Gov. Tingree at 10 o'clock last night announced that he had pardoned both Gen. W. L.

The report ci the Isthmian Canal commission, su raitted by the president to congrc-i, gives as the unanimous conclusion of that body that "the most practical! 2 and feasible route for an isthmian canal, under the control, manageme;.i ; and ownership of the United States, is that known as the Nicaragua route. The commission estimates the c-: ef this route at $200,510,000. This es timate is much, .in excess of any here tofore made, and is due to increased dimensions and ether features net heretofore considered. The commis sion also estimates the cost of a c-a- j nal by the Panama route at $142,342, i 579 according to one rotate, or $153, ! 37S.25S according to another route. As ; between the Nicaragua and Panama ! routes the commission sums up a num. : ber of advantages favorable to thz I former. It states also that under the . concessions given by the Colombian. government to the Panama Cana com pany, that government is not free f o grant tlia necessary rights to the United States except upon conditions mode by the company. The size" of locks, is 740 feet is length, 84 feet in width, in the clear, with a depth of 35 feet. Takirg up the Nicaragua route la detail, the commission says that the route sdopt ed follows essentially the lines laid down by the Nicaragua canal com mission in ita report of 1S07-1S33. It begins near Greytown on the AtIanti-3 side, follows the San- Juan river, enters lake Nicaragua and terminates at Erito, on the Pacific side. The dis tance from ocean to ocean i3 about 1S5 miles. Plans are given for the great harbors required at Greytown and Brito. The most difficult engi neering work is the dam across the San Juan river to regulate the water ef the lake. The time required to build the canal hinges almost entirely on the time required for the construc tion of this dam. The commission says eight yars would probably be a reasonable estimate for the building. At least two years will be consumed ln preparatory work and opening a harbor at Greytown.
