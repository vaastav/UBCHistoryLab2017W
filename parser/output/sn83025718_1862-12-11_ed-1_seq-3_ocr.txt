The present prodigious price of good coffee has sug gested to lovers of the beverage an econ omical arrangement by which their taste may be indulged, and yet their purses not too heavily taxed. A sample of sweet potatoe coffee was shown us yesterday. Sweet potatoes, cut into pieces the size of coffee grains, roasted in a slow oven for the samo length of time that coffee iu, and then mixed with an equal amount of coffee, will, it is asserted, produce a beverage fully as palatable as the genuine and original article.

In a paragraph in yesterday's Journal it was stated that an extensive contraband trade has been carried on over the railroad through the Adams Lxpress. We did not,by this,mcan to say that the Express Company have been engaged in contraband trade either directly or indirectly. If they have car ried contraband goods, it has been under permits granted by the Government offi cials. ; Under such permits they hare power to carry goods, and it is no part of their business to inquire what goods are in the boxes, bales, or trunks, or to whom these belong. As common carriers, they are bound to receive and forward such things as come to them uader the proper papers prepared by the Govern ment authorities, and they should not be, nor are they, held responsible even if the goods turn out to be contraband. "No one in this community or in any other has been a more loyal and lawabid ing citizen than Mr. S. A. Jones, the very efficient agent of Adams Express, and there has never been the shadow of a charge against him of having done any thing inconsistent with his obligations to tbe Government. Unquestionably some goods have been shipped that ought not to have been, but no one in the em ploy of the Company knew anything about it or had any opportunity of kuow ing. The Company could not have guard ed against the abuse without assuming and exercising powers that would justly have excited publio exasperation.

Excitement in Minnesota, The latest information received from MinncHni a represents the greatest excite ment as existing among the people of that 8tate in regard to tbe President's re vocation of the sentence of the court martial condemning to death three hun dred Indians for complicity in the recent massacres. Tho newspapers there, with out exception, take strong grounds against tbe action of the President in the mat ter, and urge upon the people the neces sity of taking vengeance in their own hands, and, in defiance of the Govern ment, executing summary punishment upon all Indians found ia the State. The following, from a Minnesota journal, will serve to convey an idea of the inten sity of feeling among the people of Min nesota in regard to the matu-r. " 'A permanent peace with the Siour,' is it? Nut, by tbe Lord of Heaven, is the tow ot 200,000 American citizens on the sou of Minnesota, and not on any soil adjouining it, except through, the death of the guilty, and the removal of every surviving shred and remnaat of the hated race. That is no longer the petition of the people of Minnesota, it is their demand a demand which they will exact to tho last retributive drop of In dian blood, and they will not stop when they shall take (if they are left to take) the work of vengeance in their own hand they will not stop to measure justice by the rule and square, and make a nice adjustment of the account of blood. Tney are not in a temper for a delicate balancing of evidence, or a judicial dis crimination of the degree of guilt. If the Government wants wholesale hang ing by the acre ; if it wants the West ern plains turned into a wide Golgotha of dead Indians, if it wants them hunt ed down like wild beasts from the face of the continent, it had better refuse to per form the act of justice which the people of this State demand and turn the un shrived criminals over to their victims." A colored woman by tbe name of Mrs. Louisa de Mortie, Lag Leea reading the American poets last week, in the 8tuyve aant Institute, New York. She ia de scribed as a magnificent looking woman, complexion of a Hushed cream j tint, hair dark and wavy, ejes large and lustrous, featnrts oral and almost classic.
