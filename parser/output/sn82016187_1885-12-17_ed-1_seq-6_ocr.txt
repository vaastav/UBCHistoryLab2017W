FINE PICTURES OF GRANT, SHERMAN, AND SHERIDAN, For Subscribers to The National Tribune. "We have received so many inquiries from our readers as to where they could obtain good portraits of the old commanders for their parlors or Post rooms, tbat we have decided to publish some fine portraits that "would be artistically equal to the finest pictures made by any one, and yet sell at a price which would place them within the reach of all. We have published three so Sax Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan. They are all magnificent likenesses, and have re ceived the most emphatic indorsement of the families and intimate friends. We guarantee them to give entire satisfaction to every ad mirer of those distinguished soldiers. They are full size 19x24 inches and printed on fine plate paper. Very much inferior pic tures have usually sold at 1, and it is very rare indeed that anything approaching them in goodness has been offered to the people as low as 75 cents. But we will furnish them to subscribers to The National Tribune at the following very low figures: Any one of the portraits ... 25 cents. The three to one address .... 50 " Any one of the portraits and The National Tribune for one year . 1.15 All three of the pictures and The Na tional Tribune for one year . . 1.40 We pay postage and all expenses on the pictures at this office, so their net cost to the subscriber will be the figures given above. The pictures will be sent inclosed in a heavy paste-board tube, so that they will reach the subscriber in the best condition. STIXt ANOTHER OFFER. Anyone who is at present a subscriber to the paper and will send us a new subscriber will receive postage-paid anyone of the pic tures that he may choose. If he sends two subscribers we will send him any two of the pictures he may choose, and for three new subscribers we will 6end all three of the pic tures to the old subscriber who secures them for us. This is a chance of getting these fine pictures by merely asking one's neighbors to subscribe for The National Tribune. e A 

CHANCE TO MAKE MONEY. Requests are coming in so rapidly for agencies to sell that thrilling war romance, " Capturing a Locomotive," that ere long all the territory will be taken up, so those wish ing to engage in the work had better not de lay. Any energetic person can make a hand Bome profit by engaging in the work of can vassing for the book, as it finds a ready sale wherever it is introduced. Send to The National Tribune Publishing Co. for terms to agents. THE RED ACORN. The unlooked-for demand for Jfr. John McElroy's charming war romance, "The Red Acorn," has entirely exhausted the edition, but another is now in preparation, and will be ready for distribution by the time this paper reaches the subscribers. We shall then be enabled to fill the many orders now waiting. The price of the book, which every veteran should have, is only$l. Weshould advise those desiring a copy to send at once, as from our experience with the last edition we predict a rapid sale for the following one. THE G.A.R. WATCH. The National Tribune will send free to every person sending 10 new subscribers an elegant nickel, stem-winding watch, in closed in a neat satin-lined case. This watch is a thoroughly reliable timepiece, and will give as much satisfaction as one costing many times the money. BO NOT Let your subscription expire. Examine the number on the address with your name, and compare it with the " Whole No." in the date line of the paper. This will show you how near yourtime isto being out. For example, the " Whole No." of this issue is 227. If the number on your address-slip is 240 you have three months to go yet, but if it is 228 your time will be out next week. It is very neces sary in this case that you renew at once, so that you do not miss any of the important matters which the coming issues will con tain. The near approach of the opening of Congress makes it doubly important that you do not miss a single number. The National Tribune Costs Only Two Cents mWeeb. THE PENSIONS rl&R PRISONERS OF "WAR. There is no class of soldiers of the Union that deserve more of the generous consideration of Congress, than those who suffered imprisonment in the slaughter pens of the South. In spile of all that has been said or written on the subject the tenth part has not been told of the awful hardships which they endured. Nothing can ever be written or painted that will ap proach giving an adequate idea of the hor rors of Andersouville, Salisbury, Florence, and Camp Ford, from June, 18G4, to April, 1SG5. Even the records of the War Department completely fail in giving any idea of the terrible mortality. The number of graves in certain National Cemeteries afford the readiest means of showing how grossly im perfect the War Department's rolls are. For example, the War Department's figures show that 29,725 prisoners died while in captivity. When we look over the table of graves in the different National Cemeteries we find the following reports from those where pris ons existed: Unknown Total. 13,71 1 1,327 2,993 0,542 1.1S1 12.12G 2l 155 2,799 5,700 5G2 12,032 Total. 15.719 22.1C9 37,SS9 Here we have absolute, unquestioned graves of 8.233 more dead prisoners than the War Department has on its rolls, and yet we have no report nor has the War Depart mentof any deaths at the following im portant prisons: Charleston, S. C. Slacon, Ga. Savannah, Ga. Milieu, Ga. Cahaba, Ala. Montgomery, Ala. Goldsboro, N. C. Columbia, S. C. Blackshire, Ga. Atlauta, Ga. Mobile, Ala. Camp Ford, Tex. Vicksburg, Miss. It is not risking anything to say that the War Department's figures onght to be at least doubled. The Department itself ad mits that, taking the percentage of deaths in prisons from which it obtained reports, and applying the same to those from which it has none, there is every reason to believe that at least 47,000 prisoners perished while in the hands of the rebels. That this is a moderate estimate is shown by certain facts in the history of Anderson ville. The average imprisonment of those confined there was not over 2 months. The pen received its first inmates Feb. 24, 18G4, but the prison did not really begin to fill up before the middle of May, when prisoners began to arrive in great numbers from the columns which had moved against Richmond and Atlanta on the 3d of May. Atlanta fell on the 2d of September, and on the 7th the Confederate authorities began to rush the prisoners away so that they would be out of reach of Sherman. By the middle of the month nearly everybody who could walk had been taken elsewhere. Thus it will be seen that the great majority of the prisoners were only in Andersonville for some period between the middle of May and the middle of September, making an average stay of each man much les3 than four months, or about 2J months as previously stated. Yet, in this short time, of every three men who so much as set foot in Andersonville, one died. From first to last there were about 45,000 prisoners put into the stockade, and, as the table above shows, there are nearly 14,000 graves there. This is not the worst. The men who were taken to Andersonville were sturdy veterans from the active, fighting armies. Thousands of them had stamina enough to live through the warm months at Andersonville, but they succumbed to the chill rains and exposures of the others pens to which they were re moved in September. That is, Andersonville broke them down, but the deadly work completed during the Fall and Winter at Charleston, Florence and Salisbury. Had it not been for the transfer, the appalling fact would have confronted us that two out, of every three men imprisoned in Anderson ville died there within six months. They did actually die there orsomewhere else, but their being scattered prevents the statistics taking the startling form the figures would have had, had the bulk of the prisoners spent the Fall and Winter of 1SG 4 in Anderson ville instead of in prisons in the Carolinas. The position that this statement supports conclusively is that ever man who was a prisoner of war in any of the Southern slaughter-pens, and who shared in an experi ence of hardships that killed two out of three of his companions must have endured irreparable physical strains that have brought about, or greatly hastened, his final breaking down; that no man could have passed scatheless through such an ordeal and that every man who did so had his bodily powers so weakened that any dis ability from which he now suffers is directly traceable to the hardships he snffered there, and the Government should, in justice, pen sion him on a scale proportioned to the length of his imprisonment and his disability. THE SPANISH TREATY. It is a satisfaction to find that the Presi dent's main objection to the Spanish Treaty is precisely what The National Tribune urged against it long before Mr. Cleveland's election. This is, that by it we give a great deal and get very little in return. We were to throw off all our duties on sugars and tobacco, which would deprive us of about 1,000,000 of revenue per week, while the Spaniards would make a reduction in the duties they impose upon American bread stuffs, etc. To take the duty off sugars would be a destructive blow to Louisiana, and would prostrate our rapidly developing sorghum and glucose industries. Even if the Spaniards gave us a monopoly of the trade of their sugar islands there would be no compensation, for there are less than Name of Cemetery. Known. Antlcrsonvillc 12,793 A-l li 111 lr J-yJi- A I vl vIlLL vJ Richmond S42 X tll l" L 11 Ult NATIONAL TRIBUNE: WASHINGTON, D. 0., THURSDAY, 2,000,000 people, all told, in Cuba and Porto Rico. These are generally exceedingly poor more than half being ex-slaves. They have few wants, and if they bought from us every yard of cloth, every gallon of oil, and every pound of food they consume their trade would still be of less importance than that of an average New York or Pennsylvania County. Therefore it would be the bight of unwisdom to sacrifice all that was proposed to be sacrificed by the treaty to get results so insignificant. THE HEATH OF "WM. H. YANDERBILT. The sudden death of the richest man in the world in what is usually supposed to be the prime of a man's usefulness, has not produced the sensation that might have been expected from such an event. Undoubtedly, wealth is a most potent fac tor in our civilization ; but, after all, it has very narrow limits, as Mr. Vanderbilt's case demonstrates. Here was a man who owned property of a value nearly approaching that in the whole 13 Colonies at the time of the Revolution. He exercised more real power than many of the second and third-class Kings of Europe. That is, he could enter more directly into the lives and fortunes of more men than can the Kings of Spain, of Holland, of Greece, Denmark, Norway or Sweden. Probably he could make or mar more men's fortunes than any monarch in the world outside of the Czar of Russia. For example, there are nearly a quarter of a mil lion men employed on the various roads that he controlled. He could advance the cheap est man's salary to a magnificent income, or dismis3 him altogether from his employ ment, at his own caprice. There was a strip of about 400 miles long in the heart of the State of New York, and as rich country as there is in the world, through which the New York Central Road passes, and is its great commercial artery. Mr. Vanderbilt, by charging one merchant or manufacturer more freight thau another, could bankrupt him ; by charging one less than another, could make him a millionaire. These are exhi bitions of power that, as we have said, are not possible in extent or kind to any monarch in the world, except the Autocrat of All the Russias. Mr. Vanderbilt's home and surroundings were of royal magnificence. No King in the world was better lodged or fed or served than he, and one would think the social power attendant upon this would be enor mous. But for all thishe occupied a relatively inferior place in our society. He was re garded as a type of wealth pure and simplej and received no other distinction than his money could buy or compel for him. He could surround himself with men who were eager to eat his dinners, and for financial reasons seem to be on intimate footing with him, but there were circles of society open to men who had not the income of one of his lower subordinates which he could not by any possibility enter. It was noted that his name does not appear in the cyclopaedias or any other publication devoted to sketches of men of power and influence in the world. A man who has written a successful book or who led a victorious expedition or in vented a useful machine, is mentioned, where the man whose wealth is estimated to be hundreds of millions did not get a line. While not distinguished for goodness, Mr. Vanderbilt was not in any sense a bad man. He gave considerable to charity, and showed something more of public spirit than is usual among the New York money kings. He spent 200,000 to bring Cleopatra's Needle to New York and ornament Central Park Avith it, and he acted with generosity towards Gen. Grant in that hero's hour of distress. He never used his immense power to oppress individuals or wreck corporations, as his fellow money kings are very fond of doing, and he lived the life of a plain, rather dull, average American citizen, with no striking virtues and no unseemly vices. He might have been a much better man than he was, but the chances are that a man with his opportunities would have been infinitely worse. CLUB RAISERS. The good friends of The National Trib une in various parts of the country who have made a little effort to extend the paper's circulation, and so increase its use fulness to the soldier, have had good luck. They are sending in clubs gratifying in numbers and size. The list of yesterday is headed by H. A. Folk, of Altoona, Pa., who sends in 40 new subscribers. In the accompanying note he says : I got the first number of your paper about a month ago. It pleased me so much that I de termined to get you what Hubscribers I could. The club I Head you is smaller than I hoped for, but I bave been .so busy that I could not get around among the boys much. Comrade Folk was one of three brothers who were in the army. They were all wounded. He and one brother were in Co. D, 45th Pa., and the other was in the 148th Pa. Next in order comes Comrade Charles M. Short, of Rossville, Ind., who sends us 19 subscribers, and says he will send more in a few days. Comrade A. Davis, of Astoria, Ore., fol lows with 17 new subscribers, whom he se cured in three days. Other successful club-raisers for the week are: II. M. Fifield. Brandon, Vt 10 Alex. Guyatt, Lycoming, N. Y. 11 Mrs. Rebecca Johnson, Felton, Cal 12 J. IJ. Niman, Mansfield, 0 10 Win. L.

Every friend of the paper can do as well as these have if they will only try. If every one who wiahee the old soldier well would stir themselves to build up the paper's cir culation it can be placed in a position where it can secure anything that is right for the soldier. A MUGWUMP OPINION. The Boston Advertiser is another one of those papers which claim to exclusively represent the "culchah" of the "uppah classes," and regards the workingmen, sol diers and such as merely existing for the comfort and aggrandizement of the aforesaid " uppah classes." This is what it had to say in reference to Secretary Lamar's report : Secretary Lamar's declaration in favor of liberal pensions to the veterans of the Union army, which we have already quoted, is more creditable to his heart and his patriotism than to his intelligence and good judgment. He says that, as long as the annual payments of interest on the National debt exceed the payments for pension?, the country could not complain that too much is done for those who fought. Last year the payments of interest on the public debt were 551,000,000, and the pay ments for pensions SrG,000,000. It would appear that his rule had already eca-cd to apply. In fact, there is nothing in common between the two kinds of payment which makes such a comparison of any value. The Nation must pay the interest on its debt or be forever dishonored. It is a contract en gagement. Tho Nation paid the soldiers their wages according to the terms of enlistment. Pen sions arc n generous gratuity, and the liberality of the Nation in this particular has been munificent beyond anything before known in the history of the world. The Advertiser convicts itself. The posi tion of Secretary Lamar rests on the sound est basis of justice. The pension money paid the men who saved the Nation's life is a debt of even more sacredness than the in terest upon the money lent to sustain the Nation in the same troublous times. It is a debt that cannot be repudiated without deepest dishonor. If it had not been for the self-sacrifice and patriotism of the men who are receiving the pensions, the prop erty of the bondholders would not be worth the paper it is printed on, and instead of their having got 2.205,019,419.19 in inter est, they would not have got any more than did the holders of those Confederate bonds which are used to paper the walls of South ern houses. In no sense are the pensions "a generous gratuity." The assumption that such is the case is an insult. It is a humiliating pa trouizatiou from an aristocrat, who assumes tbat everything that those less richer than himself get is a largess from his own purse. Pensions to disabled soldiers were as much a part of the contract as interest to the bond holders, and it is downright dishonesty to deny them. Tins is a day of general whitewashing, and everybody is getting. such clean records that the mystery grows deeper every day who in the world could have fought our armies so in the South ; who bushwhacked our pickets; who maltreated our prisoners, and who generally caused so much of the trouble that our people experienced between 1801 and 1PG5. The most sickening dose of whitewash, however, is that which the New York Tribune persists in laying on one "Jack" Warner, of Centralia, 111., who was the Quartermaster of Libby Prison, under the Winder regime. He now represents himself as having been an angel of mercy to those confined there, and the Iribune says: "Many an ex-soldier who saw the inside of that pen. will rise up to-day and call the name of Capt. Jack Warner blessed." We will be blessed if they will. Let us hear from some of our friends who knew this man while in Libby. The rumor that Minister Peudleton and his wife are much dissatisfied with Berlin has a deeper significance than any mere personal tastes of our amiable Minister and his cultivated wife. The underlying fact is that the German Government envies and hates this country, and neglects no oppor tunity to snub and .affront us. It made things so unpleasant that Minister Sargent, who preceded Mr. Pendleton, had to ask to be recalled, and Mr. Pendleton will doubt less have to do the same thing. The question is, how long our Government will continue to submit tamely to this studied incivility. Many a Government has gone to war for less reason than was given us by the exclusion of our hog products, but we pocketed the insult without a protest. We hope that Mr. Cleveland's Administration will not be so meek. . The number of pension certificates issued during the week ending Dec. 14, 1885, was as follows: Original, 899; increase, 722; re-issue, 21; restoration, 9; duplicate, 31. accrued, G; Act of March 3,1833, 4; Order April 3, 1884, 1G; Act of March 3, 1885, 15; total, 1,723. m So FAR, the money returns from the Ger man Colonial policy have been discourag ingly small. The only things that the Ger mans have been able to sell in Africa are brandy and gunpowder, and there are no signs of any increase in this trade. The reception of the President's Message by the press of tho country was unusually flattering. The ones who complain most about it are the woman suffragists, whom it never mentions. The friends of soldiers in Congress have opened the campaign admirably, with a number of excellent pension bills, which are enumerated in our Congressional report. We shall discuss these at length in next week's paper. always mention. Those who desire premiums should not tail to mention the fact, with every list of names they send in. This will prevent mistakes and aid us in keeping the account. MRS.

DECEMBER 17, 1885. -TEN PAGES. SI 4ND TIJE DOCTORS. He Joins the Pale Procession at Sick Call. Si Klegg was a good specimen of a healthy, robust Hoosier lad for he could scarcely be called a man yet. Since ho lay in his cradle and was dosed with paregoric and catnip tea like other babies, he had never seen a sick day, except when ho had the mumps on "both sides" at once. He had done all ho could to starve the doctors. When the 200th Ind. took the field it had the usual outfit of men who wrote their names sandwiched between a military title in front and " M. D." behind, a big hospital tent, and an apothecary shop on wheels, loaded to tho guards with quinine, blue-tuuss, castor oil, cp soni salts, and all other devices to assuage tho sufferings of humanity. Tho boys all started out iu good shape, and there had been hardly time for them to get sick much yet. So up to this stage of the regi nicnt's history the doctors had found little to do hut issue arnica and salvo for lame legs and blistered feet, and strut around in their shiny uniforms. But there came a day when they had all they could attend to. On going into camp one after noon the regiment, being well in advance, struck a big held of grccu corn and an orchard of half-ripe apples. Of course the boys sailed in, and natural consequences followed. "Now this issomcthin' like!" said 3i, as ho squatted on tho ground along with Shorty and half a dozen messmates. They surrounded a camp-kettle full of steaming cars, and half a bushel or so of apples heaped on a poncho. B S Laying the Foundation. "Wish we had some o' mother's butter to grease this corn with." observed Si, as ho flung a cob into tho fire and seized a fresh ear. All agreed that i's head was level on the butter question, but under all tho circumstances of the case they were glad enough to have tho corn without butter. Tho cars went off with amazing rapidity. Every man seemed to bo afraid he wouldn't get his share. When the kettle was empty the boys turned themselves loose on the apples, utterly reckless of results. So they were filled full, and were thankful. When Si got up he burst off half the buttons on his clothes. Ho looked as if he was carrying a bass-diuui in front of him. After he begau to shrink he had to tie up his clothes with a string until he had a chance to repair damages. But during the next 24 hours he hud something else to thiuk of. In fact, it wasn't long till Si began to wish he had eaten an ear of corn and an apple or two less. Ho didu't feel very well. He turned in early, thinking he would go to sleep and bu all right in the morning. Along in the night ho uttered a yell that came near stampeding the company. An enor mous colic was raging around in his interior, and Si fairly howled with pain. He thought he was going to die right away. ' A Rude Awakening. "Shorty," said he, between the gripes, to his comrade, "I'm afeard I'm goiu' to peter out. After I'm gone you write to to Annie and tell her I died for my country, like a man. I'd ruthor been shot thau die with tho colic, but I 'sposo 'twont mako much difference after it's all ovor!" "I'll do it." replied Shorty. "We'll plant you in good shape; and. Si, we'll gather up the corn-cobs and build a monument over you ! " But Si wasn't cut off in the bloom of youth by that colic. His eruptive condition fright ened Shorty, however, and though ho w:is in nearly as bad shape himself, he went up and routed out one of tho doctors, who growled a good deal about being disturbed. The debris of tho supper scattered about the camp told him what was the matter, aud he hud no need to mako a critical diagnosis of Si's case. He gave him a dose of something or other that mado tho pain let up a little, and Si managed to rub along through the night. Fortunately for Si, and for moro than half the members of tho regiment, tho army did not move next day, and tho doctors had a good op portunity to get in their work. At the usual hour iu the morning the bugler blow the "sick-call." A regiment of tanned and grizzly veterans from Ohio lay next to the 200th Ind., and as Si lay there ho heard them take up tho music Gil yer qui - nine ! Git yer qui - nine 1 Turn -ble up you sick and lame and blind; r?r- Git a - long right smart, you'll be left be - hind. "Fall in for yer ipecac !" shouted tho Or derly of Co. Q. Si joined the procession and went wabbling up to tho " doctor's" shop. Ho Visits the Doctor. was bettor than he had been during the night, but still looked a good deal discouraged. It was a regular matinoo that day. The Sur geon and his assistants were all on hand, as the various squads, colicky and cadaverous, came to a focus in front of tho tent. lNflPt jjr -m' 4"iryrN 'H fI ..; The doctors wgrked off the patients at a rapid rate, generally prescribing the sarno medicine for all, no matter what ailed them. This was the way the army doctors always did, but it happened in this case that they were not far wrong, as the ailments, arising from a common cause, were much the same. Si waited till his turn came, and received his rations from the Hospital Steward. Of course, he was excused from duty for the day. and as he speedily recovered his normal condition he really had a good time. A few daysafter this the whole regiment was ordered on fatigue duty, to repair au old cordu roy road. Si didn't want to go, and "played oil'." He told the Orderly he wasn't able to work, hut the Orderly said he "would have to shoulder an ax or a shovel. nnli hn wn -r. cused by the doctor. He went up at sick-call aim made a wry lace, with his bjmds clasped over his body in the latitude of his waistband. The doctor gave him a lot of blue-mass uills. which Si threw into the fire as soon as ho got back to hi3 quarters. Then ho played seven-up all day with Shorty, who had learned before Si did how to get a day off when he wanted it. Si thought it was a great scheme, but he tried it ouce too often. Tho doctor " caught on," and said, the next time Si went up. that castor oil wa3 . what he needed to fetch him around. So he poured out a large dose and made Si take it right then and there. S&3L .Jfiagj 'S'Cz&i Fit fop. Duty. The next time fatigue duty was ordered Si thought he felt well enough to go along with the boys. A NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT.
