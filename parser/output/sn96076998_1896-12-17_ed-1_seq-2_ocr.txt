Couldn't 6tand Social Oitrtcltm-Both Were Prominent In Church Work Antonio Maceo, lnauraent Leader, Waa Murdered br the Bpanlah. Taka Their Own Llree. Mrs. Sarah B. Ingersoll Cooper and . her daughter, Harriet Cooper, both wide ly known as workers In the catiBe of tem perance, Christianity and philanthropy, committed suicide together In their home In San Francisco Thursday night. Mrs. Cooper's will was discovered upon a table in the apartment, Informing the world of the joint suicide and requesting that the bodies be not taken to the morgue. Mrs. Cooper and her daughter were foremost among the members of the Woman's Suf frage Association. Mrs. Cooper was. In fact, president of the California Woman Suffrage Association and was prominent ly identified with church and kindergar ten work. She taught the largest Bible class in the world, and was a prominent officer of the Woman's Christian Temper ance Union. The suicide has made a profound sensation in the city, where Mrs. Cooper and her daughter had been until recently the leaders in church and Christian affairs generally. The tragedy Is directly traceable to the recent scandal which culminated in the church trial and condemnation of Uev. Dr. Charles O. Brown, pastor of the First Congregation al Church. Mrs. Cooper was one of his warmest supporters in the early. part of the trial. Before the end of the trial, however. Mrs. Cooper and her daughter turned against him, and the part of the Coopers in the case was in violent dis agreement with the church element, which censured them for their activity against the accused clergyman. Since the trial the Coopers had been snubbed by former friends and given the cold shoulder by their associates in church work. Harriet Cooper was so oppressed with the burden of the social boycott that was imposed upon herself and her mother that her health failed and she suffered from nervous prostration. She often spoke of taking her own life, but had been dissuaded by her mother.
