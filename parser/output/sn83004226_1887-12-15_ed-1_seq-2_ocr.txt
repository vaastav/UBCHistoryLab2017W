Marcum, of Ken tucky, who was recently appointed an Indian Inspector, hits been at tacked rather viciously by an ob scure Kansas paper. He is alao scored by Mr. Charles E. Kincaid, a Washington correspondent. The particulars of the charges that have been filej ngajns-t him in the Inte rior Department are not given. Mr. Kincaid denounces him as "an illit erate libertine," which would indi cate that Col. Murcum's grammar is bad, and th?(t tljere is a woman in the case. Col. Marcum was editor pftlje Catlettsburg Democrat before his appointment. For a number of years he wus Register of the. Land Office. No one ever accused Tom Marcum of bpjng a brilliant man, but he has his jrjends in this State who believe that he ought tfl have a hearing before he js condemned. He has a wife and a fuiuily, and thpy deserve tome consideration even at the hands ol his political enemies. What has he done? If he '8 guilty of any heinous crime, he ought to be removed from office, If he is innocent, he is entitled to have his say. Col. Marcum js some distance from home, and it is only fair (hat the puliljp verdict be suspended until he can defend himself from his assailants. . Absolutely Pure. This powder never varies.
