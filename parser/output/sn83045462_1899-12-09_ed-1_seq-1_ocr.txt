Brooklyn Gains on the New Orleans. It now looks as if the cruiser Brooklyn would beat the cruiser New Orleans after all in the race for Manila. According to advicets - ' ed at the Navy Department the Bro,klyn arrivid at Singapore on the 7th instant, and so ar as known the New Orleans has not yet reached that point. Both boats were at Colombo at the same time, and the Brooklyn left that port one day ahlad of the New Orleans, Up to that time the New Orleans had been gradually gaining on her bulkier rival. She started from the United SLates flve days later than the Brooklyn, and on leaving Colombo was but one day beh:nd. It has been suggested that the officers of the Brooklyn were not aware that the.New Orleans was endeavor ing to overtake them until that vessel ap peared in the harbor of Colombo. and that they then decided to putt the big cruiser on her mettle. The run from Singapore will he the last lap on the trip, as the vessels will no! stop again until they reach Ma nila. The Manmuense Returning. Gen. Otis reports that the Manauense, which had such a rough passage from San Francisco to Manila, has started on the homeward voyage. This fact satisfies offi cials of the department that the condition of the vessel has been misrepresented and that she is perfectly seaworthy. THE GRIDIRON CLUB.

He suggested that the pay in Surgeon Rafter's case be suspended until certain accounts for the provisioning of sick soldiers on board the transport are settled. In a protest which Captain Rafter has filed with the War De partment he represents that he is not re sponsibile for the conditions which pre vailed on the Tartar. CALLED TO OBJECT. Californians Interested In the French 'Reciprocity Treaty. All but two members of the California delegation in Congress called at the State Department today to discuss with the oti cals the French reciprocity treaty, which is now pending lefore the Senate. The Californians, basing their action upon news paper publicatiow as to the character of the treaty, are op)posing vigorously so much of the new treaty as appears to threaten the California wine and fruit interests. - Secretary Hiy referred the delegation for accurate information as to the scope of the treaty to Sp,ial Penipetentiary Kasson, who negotiated the instrument for the United States, and the gentlemen spent a half hour in conferenee 1with him on the subject. THE MEDICAL STAFF. (ken. Sternberg's 1918 to Icrease the Present Arury Force. Surgeon General Sternberg dias prepared a bill for presentation to Congress, provid Ing for a material increase of the medical department of the army to meet the greatly increased demands of the existing military organization. The mertdical department now consists of 192 commissioned- medical offi cers, together with over 400 physiciana act ing as assistant surgeons under contract with the surgeon general. The bill pre pared by that offiecr provides for the ad dition to the corps of four assistant sur geon generals with the rank of colonel, ten dtputy sut-geon generalsewith the rank of lieutenant colonel, thirty surgeons with the rank of majo; ar.d eighty assistant sur geonq with the rank of first lieutenant, who shall have the rank of captain at the ex piration of five years of service. It is pro vided that the vacancies thus created in the grade of colonel, heutenant colonel and major shall be tilled by seniority promotion in accordance with established laws and regulations. A Probationary Period. Acting assistant surgeons to the number required authorized are to be appointed subject to the usual examination for a pro bationary period of six months, during which they will attend the army medical school in Washington, at-the expiration of which time if their standing is good they are to be commissioned to fill existing va cancies. This probationary service is waived in the case of candidates who have rendered satisfactory service as acting as sistant surgeons or as commissioned medi cal officers it. the volunteer army for a period of six months or more, who may be commissioned at once on passing satisfac tory examination as to their physical, moral and professional qualifications. Contract Surgeons Neeessary. The surgeon general argues that as the existing medical organization was Insuf ficient for the army of 25,000 men on a peace basis, it is manifestly inadequate to the largely increased, army and the many additional garrisons, including those in Porto Rico. in Alaska and in the Hawaiian Islands, to say nothing of the future medi cal needs of the army in the Philippines. Even with the increased number of medical officers provided for in the proposed bill. he says, it will still be necessary for many years to come to employ a considerable number of contract surgeons to meet the requirements of the service.

WHITE HOUSE Three Republican Leaders at the Executive Mansion. NEITYERI NA INALCHA IANSHIP President Petitioned to Intervene in the Transvaal. CALTFORNIANS AND TARIEF At the White House today were three men, one of whom will manage the republi can campaign next year. They were Sen ator Hanna. looking well, but showing some effects of rheumatism; Henry C. Payne. the republican national committee man from Wisconsin. and Representative Dick of Ohio. Senator Hanna and Mr. Payne went to the Executive Mansion to gether, a basis for further suspicion that Mr. Payne will succeed the Ohio political general in handling the republican end of the next big contest. When asked about retiring from the man agement of the campaign next year, Mr. Hanna repeated the statement made in a recent interview: "No one is authorized to say what I will do." said the senator. but he stopped at these carefully chosen words, and nothing could induce him to commit himself one way or the other. Close friends of the senator say that he will do next year the same work for th.' republican party that he did three years ago. If he is physically able he will be President McKinley's choice, and that is what settles the selection of a chairman. Judge Ewart Calls. Senator Pritchard was at the White House with several North Carolinians, among them Judge Ewart. Judge Ewart was originally selected for the bench be cause President McKinley had known and liked him when they were in the House to gether. Senator Pritchard favored another candidate. but when he saw the President's desire he withdrew his own candidate and has since supported Judge Ewart. who has been twice nominated. The question now is whether the President will again send Judge Ewart's name to the Senate. Al though it can be claimed that the Senate has not directly voted on the case the President has no desire to put himself in antagonism to that body. The effort now being made is to show the President that if the name is again sent in Judge Ewart will be confirmed. many sen ators having offered to support him who have heretofore held aloof. Another matter soon to be presented to the President is a petition signed by the attorneys of Judge Ewart's district. Every attorney, except eight, in the forty-seven ecunties of the district have signed a peti tion asking that Judge Ewart be continued on the bench. This petition is to be pre sented to Senator Marion Butler. who has led the fight in the Senate against Judge Ewart. Judge Ewart will cntinue to hold court 1,ntil a successor Is appointed, or until the end of the present term of Congress. H he is to remain on the bench longer than the end of this Congress he will have to be nominated again. For Peace in the Transvaal. Senator Burrows of Michigan presented to the President an elabourtely prepared petition asking that the chief executive tender the good offices of the United States in the settlement of the difficulty between great Britain and the two South African republics. The petition is signed by a com mittee representing Hollanders of Michigan. There are thousands of Hollanders in that state, and they are all deeply interested in the contest now waging. They recently held a giganti' meeting and appointed a commit tee to present suitable resolutions to the President. He stated in his message that had "circumstances suggested that the parties to the quarrel would have welcomed .any kindly expression of the hope of the Ameri can people that war might be aerted" the good offices of the United States would have been tendered. The petition will be referred to the State Department, but no action will be taken. Californians and the Tariff. Senator Perkins and the republican and democratic members of the House from California talked with President McKinley this morning about reciprocity treaties, which, they feared, may encroach upon California interests. The particular treaty touched upon was that recently negotiated with Jamaica. Mr. Daniels, a represen tative of the Los Angeles board of trade and chamber of commerce, submitted to the President the views of those organiza tions, which handle the interests of the fruit growers and wine makers of southern California. Mr. Daniels said that the growers of citrous fruits do not fear that the treaty with Jamaica will affect their Interests now, but the fear is that the tieaty may open the door to other treaties which may prove injurious. The President assured the delegation that the members would be consulted rela tive to future treaties bearing upon fruits. This'was entirely satisfactory to all con cerned. A Judge for Alaska. Senator Foster of Washington talked to the President about affairs in Alaska. Judge Johnston, the only federal representative of the judiciary In Alaska, has resigned, his health having braken under the strain of overwork. He will serve until a suc cessor is nominated. Senator Foster will present a candidat!. Senator Foster says that Congress will be compelled to enact some laws for Alaska, among which must be one providing for two judges, two dis tricts and two different sets of court offi clals. This is one of the recommendatioes made by Presi4ent McKinley. Other Callers and Their Business. Senator Daniel called to ask the appoint ment of C. B. Taylor as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.
