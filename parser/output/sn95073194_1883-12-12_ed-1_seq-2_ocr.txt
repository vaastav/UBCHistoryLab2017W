On the 5th iust. the president sent to the senate a number of recess nom inations, among them Walter Q. Gresham, for postmaster-general. TnE comptroller of the currency haB authorized First National bank at LoganBport, Ind., to commence busi ness on a capitol of $230,000. The Madison county, Wyoming, treasurer heads his notices with a skull and cross-bones, signifying that death and taxes are equally certain. George Murray, of Baltimore, is one hundred and eight years of age. He married his second wife when he was seventy-four and she forty-eight. A man at Newport attempted to drown a cat by throwing her into the harbor in a paper bag. The cat reach ed her old home before the man did. Three colored children were burn ed to death the other day in Columbia Co., Ga., The parents went to church and locked the children in the cabin. At Clinton, HI., a few days ago, Mrs. Wm.

A professional woman beggar, who has traveled over ttie state with a child and monkey, has settled in San Antonio, Tex., with $6,000 in cash and will go into business. Cra Congress met on the 3d iust. and both the senate and house organized. The house by the election of Carlisle speaker, and the other officers nomi nated by the democratic caucus. The senate was called to order by Senator Edmunds, president pro tern. The usual resolution notifying the house and the president that the sen ate was ready for business was agreed to. The president's message was sent in and read. It Is somewhat lengthy discussing a variety of subjects. He speaks of our foreign relations as pleasant and free from complications, but recommends that Spain be re quired to settle claims of American citlrens; believes that Mexico needs and must receive more fraternal at tention from the U. S. government. Recommends the reduction of the revenues, and gives a statement of the government finances for the cur rent year. Urges the construction of coast defenses, and the rehabilitation of the navy. Does not favor the gov ernment telegraph system. Suggests the propriety of restrictive railroad legislation. Civil service reform, bo far, considered a success. The presi dent claims that legislation is needed npon the subject of presidential suc cession, as well as to guarantee social rights to colored citizens. He also recommends further action and legis lation in regard to Utah, and believes the present law intended to repress or prevent polygamy in that territory has failed to accomplish any good, and while Mormons control the leg islation of the territory will probably never succeed in working out a great ly needed reform in Utah. Several bills were introduced in the senate. By Ingalls, to amend the arrears of the pension law by removing certain limitations in that act. Beck, providing for the removal of all disabilities imposed by the four teenth amendment to the constitution. Also authorizing American citizens to purchase foreign built ships and engage in the foreign carrying trade. Edmnnds, providing for further protection of the colored citizens of the United States against the viola tion of certain rights secured by the constitution. Also to establish a postal telegraph system. Sherman, providing for tho issue of the circulation of national banks, al lowing circulation to be issued for 90 per cent of the market value of bonds instead of the face value. VanWyck, declaring that railroad corporations shall pay within sixty days the costs of surveying and locat ing lands to which they are entitled. Otherwise they to be subjected to state and local taxation, and also to pre-emption and homestead entry. Also, to restore to the public domain lands, donated but not earned by rail road corporations where the roads are not finished within the time spec ified in the grant. Also, to protect all pre-emption and homestead en tries on lands forfeited by failure to build the road within tho time speci fied. Also, for the relief of settlers on public lands in Nebraska and Kansas on the line of the Denver & St. Joe road. (It provides for the payment of $3.50 per acre to settlers whose land by tho decision of the su preme court reverted to the railroad company under the grant which was supposed to have been forfeited). Also, to repeal the Northern Pacific grants. It confirms to the company all lands earned by the construction of any portion of the road, but re stores to settlement and sale several million acres in Washington territory and Oregon, being applicable to that portion of the line west of Wallala Junction. The rights of settlers on odd sections ib preserved by allowing them to enter upon the homestead or pre-emption laws or to purchase not less than 160 acres at $25 per acre. The graceful way in which a poli tician who has been compelled to use a shot gun to carry an election down in Mississippi waives formalities so as to save -expense to the county, is a credit to that commonwealth. Some of the uneasy "niggers" in Copiah county who were apparently not sat isfied with the killing of J. P. Matth ews by the chairman of the democrat ic county committee, for disobedience to the order of the committee forbid ding him to come to the polls on elec tion day, and in fact who are satisfied with nothing fair, complained be cause the coroner did not sit on the body of the "deceased scalawag." Matthews was not a carpet-bagger, and hence was a scalawag. The cor oner is not a man to rest under an imputation that he does not know his duty, and do it at all hazards, and he comes out in a card, which is simple, concise and right to the point. Here it is: In regard to the killing of J. P. Mattbewi, it was suggested to me by T. P. Ware that I had better have a jury of inquest over the body ; before summoning the jury, I was told E. B. Wheeler did not deny the act; I saw him and he told me that he had done it and I could make out my verdict that way. W. M. Robertson, Coroner. He has a cast iron cheek who will contend, after this, that judicial notice has not been taken of the affair. It will probably suggest itself to the chairman of the democratic committee of Copiah county that the public slaughter of the meddlesome T. P. Ware is the next enterprise that should engage his attention. State Journal. Mbs. G. C. Smith, of Springfield, III., is compiling a book of hymns and sacred poems written by women, in order to show what good work wo men have done as hymnologists. Mrs. Smith wants some more temperance and missionary hymns to complete those departments, and invites "wo men wbo are talented in that direc tion" to send contributions to her addrtfla ftt 111 North Grand At. Our attention was called yesterday to a very handsome poster represent ing one of Nichols' Sbepard & Co's. world-renowned threshing machines, the same being one of the premiums offered to the subscribers of the Oma ha Weekly Bee. The Bee's premium list this year is truly a liberal offer, comprising over 200 grand premiums, worth from $25.00 to $1,800.00 each. At the head of the list we find an $1,800 lot, located on Sherman Ave., Omaha; a threshing machine with power, a traction engine, worth $1,000, a Grand piano, and numerous other valuable articles, farming implements, sewing machines, gold and silver watches, silverware, and the like. Besides those, nearly 25,000 minor presents are offered, thus assuring a premium to every subscriber, who prepays for one year, the price being only $2.00. Every premium is guar anteed to be worth not less than $1.00. The grand total of these presents which will be distributed on the 31st of December, foots up to over 35,000 dollars. The large number of ack nowledgements by the fortunate re cipients of premiums given in former years 6peaks for the satisfactory man ner in which those distributions are conducted. The weekly Bee is one of the newsiest weekly journals pub lished, and furnishes an uncommonly large amount of valuable reading of a general interest, containing both east ern and western news. Many of our acquaintances who do not themselves read the weekly Bee subscribe for it, and have the papers forwarded to their friends and relatives, while they retain tho premium tickets. A very good idea, to be sure. Write them for sample copies. U. 8. Senate. Mr. Blair presented a joint resolu tion from the legislature of New Hampshire opposing further grants of land to railroads, and any renewal of forfeited land grants. Mr. Butler introduced a bill to re peal the internal revenue laws now in force,and abolish the internal revenue. Mr. Cullom introduced a bill to re organize the legislative power in Utah. Mr. Blair, a joint resolution pro posing a constitutional amendment regarding alcoholic liquors. Tho pro posed amendment prohibits the man ufacture or sale of distilled alcoholic intoxicating liquors, except for medi cinal, mechanical, chemical and scien tific purposes or use in arts in any of the states; and exportation of such liquors, except for the purposes nam ed ; aud the bill provides that should the amendment not be ratified by three-fourths of the states before the last day of December, 1890, the pro hibition it proposes takes effect as an act of congress at the expiration of ten years.

Gvstofsok was arrested the oth er day near Oakland, Neb., charged with robbing A. . Johnson on his return home from town of all the money he had with him. Gustofsou was brought back to town and ex amined, bound over for his appear ance at the next term of the district court in the sum of $1,000 and failing to give bond was taken to the Blair jail for safe keeping. Constable Waller, who accompanied Sheriff Beckman to make tho arrest, searched the bed and found the pocket-book which contained only $33. A sad accident occurred the other evening twenty-five miles northeast of Kearney, on the Loup City road. Walter Dodge about 16 years old was left at home with his two sisters, Myrtie and Mary, aged 9 and 13, while their parents were attending a school meeting near by. In fooling with a shot gun, Walter accidentally shot both his sisters in the back of their heads, instantly killing the younger, and fatally injuring the other. The trial of O'Donnell, for the mur der of James Carey, began on the morning of the 30th ult, before Judge Geo. Denman in the old Baily police court, London. The small court room was crowded, and several ladies were present. No one was admitted with ont a ticket. The approaches were thronged. The trial ended on the 1st inst. by the return of a verdict by the jury of wilful murder, and the court passed sentence of death in the usual form.

Senator Logan's bill introduced in the senate provides that every person entering the service of the country during the late war, cither the army or navy, and honorably discharged therefrom, for any period of service less than one year, bo enti tled to eighty acres of the public land, either for himself or heirs; for ser vices between one and two years, 120 acres; and over two years' service, 160 acres. Miles N. PosdJ an old resident of Minneapolis, was shot twice the other afternoon by Mrs. Geo. Swartz, one ball wounding him slightly aud tho other entering the abdomen on the right side, inflicting a dangerous wound. Mrs. Swartz had heard that Pond circulated ill stories against her, and this is the cause for her crime. The woman and her husband were arrested and held to await Poud's injuries. Anna Gray is county school super intendent of Polk county, Neb.; Mrs. T. M. Hopgood, of Phelps, and Mrs. E. T. Schick, of Nemaha. Ella Tag gart Schick is credited with having the best institute ever held in Nemaha county, which is a land of institutes aud normal schools. Miss Rankin is superintendent of Furnas county; Lucy McFaddeu, of Adams county, and Mrs. M. R. Morgan, of Harlan county. Senator Manderson presented on the 6th in tho U. S. senate memorials and petitions from the legislature ot Nebraska, asking that railroads to whom the government has granted lands, bo cither compelled to takeout patents, so that they may be taxed, or the lands revert to the people; also, that the duty be removed on barbed wiie; also, urging the improvement of the Missouri river. A recent report from Paris says twenty-seven additional officers and a lot of war material will bo sent to Tonquin immediately. The govern ment has an official dispatch from Admiral Courbet that preparations are being made tor an advance, Dec. 26th. His steum launches are ready to support him by movements on tho canals near Hanoi, Bacninb, and Sontay. We believe that the elevation of Van Wyck to the senate of the United States was a forerunner of disaster. Events and facts are competent to show that our belief i3 logical. Oma ha Republican. Senator Van Wyck ha, by his fearless defence of the rights of his constituents, proven tho belief of the Republican to be not only illogical, but wilfully false. Burt on ian. Tony Laymiller, teaching school near Canton, Ohio, suspended Mary Oglethorpe, aged 11, for six and a half hours by the wrists, her toes barely touching the floor, seriously injuring the child. He has been held for trial. His own medicine with a regular Delaware flogging besides, would be too good for him. Somebody told President Arthur that George Bliss had said that young Allen Arthur was a little wild and Bhould be looked after. Mr. Arthur said with some impatience : "George Bliss had better mind his own busi ness. He and yon and I were all boys ourselves, and you cannot make an old man out of a boy." Andrew J. Wilson was arrested at Ord. Xeb., the other night by sher iff Thurston of that county, assisted by sheriff Farrell, of Mills county, Iowa, and sheriff Chandler of Fre mont, Neb. lie is charged with rob bing the Riverton, la., bank in July, '81, in company with Polk Wells, and has since been at large. Words of commendation from the press on every hand (except the Omaha Bepublican and Lincoln Jour nal who uever acknowledge any thing good from that source) for the course of Senator Van Wyck on rail road questions, aud the relief of settlers on land along the line of the Denver & St. Joe road. Near Anderson, Ind., the other evening, John J. Johnson was shot by C. Hawkins, aud dangerously wounded. After the shooting Haw kins returned home and shot himself, dying instantly. Both men are wealthy farmers. The trouble arose from a dispute about a ditch between their farms. A fire started the other morning about 4 o'clock in the town ot St. Paris, Ohio, (supposed to be incen diary), which destroyed all the busi ness houses on Main street, except a bank. Goods placed in the street were burned. The loss will probably reach $150,000, with very little in surance. George Washington was given a ducking in Baltimore recently. A fire engine turned out aud squirted water up the shaft in Mount Vernon place until the father of bis country came out as bright as a new pin. An immense crowd stood around during the novel performance. The stiiri.:its of Yale Cu'lcge have been attacked with tj phoid h;m1 mala rial fever. It-uppear.iuce i puzzling the facility, as the rcwerngeund drain age appear perfect. There are a num ber of students ill of malarial fever, but them is no great alarm. Two students have died ot typhoid fever. Ik a!! Hit public office? in this coun try had fixed claries attached, aud all fees were made payable to the local, j state and uatiouni government res-, pectively, there would be less cor- j rupttou in politics and fewer dishon est men in the great scramble for office. David City Republican. There is great excitement over the flight of Thomas Craig, president of the Exchange bank at Montreal, and the feeling is turned completely from the great defaulter to the directors who allowed him to escape, and somo ot whom are alleged to bo at least privy to his delinquencies. Mrs. Mattie Booth, a colored woman, has opened a school tor women in her husband's parisli in Selina, Ala. In tho three months of the school she has welcomed forty who were unable to go elsewhere, some of them sixty, seventy, aud seventy-five years old. News from Madrid of the 29th ult., says Frederick William, tho crown prince of Germany, wa-j elected fel low of the academy of jurisprudence by a vote ot 180 to 12. King Aliouso and the crown prince of Geruriny woro present at the banquet of the German legation. Omaha h said to be overrun with thieves, robbers, burglars and desper adoes. The city authorities should be more watchful and reduce their outside numbers. The truth is that persons who cannot give a good account of themselves should be taken up as vagrants. The business failures last week iu the U. S. and Canada numbered 307. Rather a formidable list, and show? something wrong in business affairs. We believe the cause for these fail ures cannot be justly attributed to un apprehension of a revision of the tariff. Mrs. Mary A. Miller of New Orleans has applied for a license as master of a steamboat. The super vising inspector of the district re ports her competent, but debars her on account ot her sex. The case is referred to the solicitor of the treas ury. It is said that an agreement was recently signed at Chicago by the mauagcrs of the Rock Island, St. Paul and Uniou Pacific roads for the pur pose of fighting the Burlington and .Northwestern road, and breaking the Iowa and Colorado pools. The bill introduced by Senator Cullom to reorganize the legislative power of the territory of Utah pro vides that it be vested in the govern ment and a legislative council com posed of nine members, to be appoint ed by the president. A little girl stood waiving her cloak recently on the Wabash road, near Blandonville, and the engineer who saw her brought his engine to a standstill within a short distance of where a broken rail would have wrecked tho train. Miss Clara Kenrick, of South Or leans, Mass., was appointed the other day to a clerkship in the collector's department at the Boston Custom House, the first appointment in that department under the civil service rules. A. C. Ayres, local ticket agent of the Cincinnati and Northern railroad, was arrested the other night for em bezzlement, after which he made a desperate attempt to commit suicide, which has left him in a critical condi tion. The decree abolishing the prohibi tion of American pork into France states "If pork is carefully salted there is no danger of trichinosis." The municipal authorities will seize any bacon imperfectly salted. A Mr. Burns of Burt county re cently, while drunk, allowed his team to run off, throwing his little boy out of the wagon, who has since been suffering terribly. Burns was thrown out, too, but was unhurt. The internal taxes already collect ed for the present year are at the rate of $123,000,000 per annum. The commissioner estimates that the col lections for the entire year will amount to $130,000,000. A Palo Alto, Iowa, editor retires from the business with the remark that "no true Christian cau edit a newspaper." Doubtless, it would be difficult to convince that editor that he is entirely mistaken. During the week ending December 1st, the eastern roads carried 67,492 tons of flour, grain and provisions from Chicago to the east, and being an increase over the previous week of 12,418 tons. "Take away your bloody shirt," 6ays the Louisville Courier-Journal. "Take away your shot-gun," says the Hastings (Neb.) Journal. "The issue is made up," pays the Omaha lie publican. A lad named Briggs was struck by the cars near Fennville, Mich., the other day and instantly killed, while trying to see how near the train he could approach and then get out of the way. F. M. Ker, who was recently con victed at Chicago of embezzling some $40,000 from the banking bouse of Preston, Kean & Co., has been taken to Joliet to serve a sentence of ten years. There will be an attempt to change the basis of representation to the next republican national convention by which it will be composed of 870 del egate inttead of 820, the old number.
