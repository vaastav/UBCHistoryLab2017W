December 10.? The Norwegian parliament has conferred the Nobel peace prize upon President Roosevelt. It Is awarded to him in recognition of his services In ending the Russo-Japanese war. Candidates for this distinction must be proposed by legislative bodies, peace organiea.tlons or universities. It Is understood that the President's sponsors were Prof. H. P.

The members of the Nobel committee, who were seated on chairs In front of the ministers, were approached by the president of the parliament, the minister of foreign affairs and the president of the committee, who, in reply to formal questions, received from the committee the information that the peace prize had been conferrd upon President Roosevelt, who had au-? * 1 ?I inunzeu me Auit'i itau uuiuow, ^ v.. ?, to receive It. The president of parliament, Gunnar Knudsen, made a short speech in which he stated that the Norwegian parliament was the first national assembly to adopt the cause of peace, which waa now no longer an Utopia as It was twelve or fifteen years ago. beading statesmen, even chiefs of state, had taken up this cause and the United States was going Into the first line. What had especially atti"acted the attention of the warld was the work of President Rootwelt in bringing about the end of the bloody war between Russia and Japan. Thne, handing the prize to the American minister, the President of the parliament asked him to send to Mr. Roosevelt a greeting from the Norwegian people and expressed the wish that Mr. Roosevelt might be able in the future to continue his work for peace.

THE 

PRESIDENT'S PURPOSE. Will Donate Prize for Establishing ' Industrial Peace Committee. ] The announcement' was made from the J White House today that President Roosevelt had been awarded the Nobel peace ' prize by the Norwegian parliament, and that he would use the amount of the prize, about {40,000, to establish the foundation of a sum which shall be expended in bring! ng together representatives of labor and capital. The President Is the first American to win the Nobel prize. The following correspondence was made public by Secretary Loeb: 

CHRI8TIANIA, December 1, 1906. Mr. President Roosevelt. White House, Washington. (Confidential.) , Nobel committee of Norwegian parlla- ( ment today awarded you this year's peace prize. Award secret till 10th December, when public announcement In parliament by i Its president. I request you to authorize < by telegraph your representative at Chris- ] tianla, or Pelrce, receive prize there on your behalf. 

LOEVLAND, , Chairman Nobel Committee of Norwegian , Parliament. ( CHRISTLANIA. December 1, 1906. The President, Washington. I have just had a call from Norwegian minister for foreign affairs to Inform me \ officially, but In strict confidence that the Nobel peace priie has been awardel to you. Hs asked me ta communicate the.informa- , tlon to you confidentially, to be kept a secret until December 10. when It will be announced In the storthing, on which occa- i slon he asks that you delegate me to appear a? your representative to receive diploma, medal and priie. Proffering profound congratulations on this meli-mer.ted j recognition of your great and wise inter national policy, may I ask respectfully . that,, in compliance with the request made by the minister for foreign affairs, If agreeable to your wishes I be delegated for the performance of this honorable and most gratifying duty. 

PEIRCE. CHRISTIANIA. December 10. 1906. President Roosevelt. Washington. Nobel committee today signified storthing its decision. Accept our hearty wishes, expression high esteem. LOEVLAND, Chairman. The President's Acknowledgement. Minister Pelroe was directed by the President to read the following message to the storthing: "I am profoundly moved and touched by the signal honor shown me through your body in conferring upon me the Nobel peace prize. There is no gift I could appreciate more: and I wish it were in my power fully to express my gratitlde. I thank you for myself, and I thank you on behalf of the United States; for what I did I was able to accomplish only as the representative of the nation of which for the time being I am President. After much thought 1 have concluded that the best and most fitting way to apply the amount of the prize is by using it as a foundation to establish at Washington a permanent industrial peace committee. The object will be to strive for better and more equitable relations among my countrymen who ore engaged, whether as capitalists or wage workers. In Industrial and agricultural pursuits. This will carry out the purpose of the founder of the prize; for In modern life It is as important to work for the cause of Just and righteous peace in the industrial world as in (he world of nations. I again express to you the assurance of my deep and lasting gratitude and appreciation. 

"THEODORE ROOSEVELT." Industrial Peace Committee. The amount of the Nobel peace prize will be conveyed by the President to trustees, to be by them used as the foundation of a fund, the income of which shall be expended for bringing together in conference at Washington, especially during the sessions of Congress, representatives of labor and capital for the purpose of discussing industrial problems with the view to arriving at a better understanding between employers and employes, and thus promoting industrial peace. The President, with their consent, will appoint as trustees of the fund the chief justice of the United states, the Secretary of Agriculture,, the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, a representative of labor and a representative of capital. The fund will be conveyed to the trustees to be held In trust for the following purposes: To Invent and re-invest the principal of the fund: to receive any additions which may come to It by contribution, and Invest and re-Invest them; to pay over the income from the fund and Its additions to a committee of six, to be selected by the trustees, two to serve for one year, two for two years and two for three years, three of its members to be representatives of labor and three of capital, chosen for distinguished service in the industrial world for promoting righteous industrial peace, and to fill any vacancies which may occur in this committee by selection and appointment in the same manner in which the committee U originally selected and appointed.

Widening of Columbia Boad Subject of Bequest. i nai me proposed widening 01 uoiumoia road immediately east of 16th street northwest is desired by the residents and property owners in that section is evident from the number of letters recently received by the Commissioners urging congressional legislation for this improvement. The Columbia Heights Citizens' Association forwarded to the Commissioners this morning a resolution, adopted by that association several nights ago, which provides that the CommtaslnnerH recommend the enactment of a bill which Is now In Congress, the terms of which provide for the widening of this road. The bill is known as Senate 68 and H. R. 126. It was introduced at the last session, but was not passed. The members of the association make a strong appeal to the Commissioners to have this legislation put through, as its provisions, they declare, are necessary not only to beautify that section, but to relieve the congested condition existing in a section of Columbia road Immediately east of 16th ?treet. 

YEAR OT DISTRICT JAIL. Sentence Given William Hawkins on Charges of Murderous Assault. "I ain't done nothing to nobody" were the words used by William Hawkins, colored, in the Police Court today, in denying two charges of assault that had been made against him. It was alleged that he cut George Green and Charles Hill, and Judge Mullowny decided that the allegations were proven, and sentenced Hawkins to one year In the District jail. Policeman Moran of the fifth precinct made the arrest. Hill, it was testified, was in a bar room on H' street southeast Saturday night, when Hawkins approached him from behind and slashed him In the face above the eve. Hiil ran out of the saloon, but Hawkins followed him, and the knife was again slashed across Hill's face, this time below the eye. Both wounds required hospital treatment. Shortly before Gheen had been the object of an attack by Hawkins, but escaped with a slash in his clothes. "I ain't done nothing to nobody dat I 'members of." said Hawkins. "That's funny, because these other two men remember it, all right," said Judge Mullowny. REAL ESTATE TRANSFERS. C STREET SOUTHEAST between 15th and 16th streets?William P.

Most people eat molt foods without discrimination?It matter* little what. Few stop to think what that food does for them. This Is the first turn on the road to dyspepsia. Reckless disregard of the proper choice of foods, rapid eating and improper mastication, are the unquestioned causes of all stomach disorders from the slight ache to the malignant cancer. There Is nothing more reroltlng than a dyspeptic stomach?a very Tat for putrefaction, sending forth Its poison throughout the entire system, depressing the brain, befouling the breath, sou "Ing the taste, deadening the muscles, Incapacitating the liver and kidneys for their work, debilitating the heart, choking the lungs and clogging the bowels. All of these disagreeable and dangerous conditions are due to the Improper digestion of food and the consequent assimilation of poison. What else can be expected? If the food lies In the stomach, if tbe system is constipated, fermentation Is the natural outcome. It ahows Itself in sour watery risings, belchlngs, heartburn and painful breathing. There is only one way to relieve this condl Uod. If the stomach refuses to digest your food pat something Into It that will. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are nothing bat digestives. They are not a medicine. They work wben the stomach will not. Each tablet contains enough pepsin, diastase, golden seal and other digestive elements to reduce 3,000 grains of crdlnary "fljod to the proper consistency for assimilation Into the b!ood. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are absolutely pore. There Is nothing harmful In them as shown In their endorsement by 40,000 physicians In the Celled States and Canada. Ask your family physician hla opinion of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets and If he U honest toward you he will state positively that they will cure your stomach trouble whatever it may be, unless you hare waited too long and have allowed your disorder to develop Into cancer.

THE BELGIAN MINISTER Denies That He Knows Anything of the Lobby?Mr. Lodge Calls for an Inquiry. The statement that for two years King Leopold of Belgium has maintained an expensive lobby In this city for the purpose of preventing action by the United States relative to th& atrocities in the Congo Free State as printed In the New York American, has caused much comment here. The American says: "The chief of Leopold's lobbyists is Col. Henry I. Kowalsky of New York and San Francisco. Col. Kowalsky has an office at No. 49 Wall street. Up to several years ago he practiced law In San Francisco, and he Is. at present the counsel for Eugene Schmltz, mayor of San Francisco, and Abe Ruef, the Warwick of the Schmitz administration, both of whom are under indictment on charges of graft. "Kowalsky, according to the agreement with Leopold, was to receive J20,(XK) in 3 per cent state bonds of the Belgian government if no action was taken by the ITnited States relative to the Congo situation during the first session of the flftyninth Congress. "Associated with Kowalsky, and men tloned In the agreement drawn up by the Belgian state department, were Alfred Nerlncx and Henry Wellington Waek. The compensation which Nerlncx and Wack were to receive for their service Is not stated In the agreement. "James Whitley, who signed himself consul general of the Congo, but whose credentials authorizing him to act In that capacity were never presented to the State Department, was also perniciously active against the Congo memorial all through the first session of the Fifty-ninth Congress. "Whitley did not hesitate to write letters to senators and representatives bearing upuu mc vungu Biiuaiiun. oorne 01 me reclpients of these letters considered the advisability of suggesting: to the State Department the propriety of asking for his recall, and would have done so had they not learned that he had no official standing." Instructions to the Lobby. The American says the copy of the Instructions under which the lobby was to work' and of the agreement as to reward for success Is as follows: : "All of the state's agents owe obedience to the king's envoy, whose advice they must follow. 1 "Each one of these agents has his special mission. Mr. Nerlncx will have to keep ud his relations with and university { circles. r "By lectures, meetings and public discus- t slons, he must strive to bring the intellectual and religious public to a just appreciation of the Congo affairs. "He will also have to give publicity to all t documents which will be regularly posted ^ to him, with a view to enlightening public e opinion. 1 "Col. liowalsky's mission is to enlighten senators and representatives as to the Justice of our cause and to ward oft the pass- f lng of unfavorable resolutions' by them. "He will be careful not to call at the White House except In case of absolute ne- 1 cessity and not to put forward his title of i: legal- adviser to the state but 1n judicial e questions. He will make no public speeches t except after taking the Belgian minister's c advice. i "Mr. Wack will continue his work in the press and advocate the state's cause in s pamphlets and other publications. Like In g the past and in the interest of his lnde- 1 pendence. he will have to act as if he were I not In the state's employ, but merely an Impartial- publicist. a "The state wishes Col. Kowalsky to go to s Nigeria. This is an important mission and I its fulfillment by Col. Kowalsky would mean a serious economy to the state. d "If the American government does not make any declaration harmful to the Congo c state, and if Congress passes no unfavor- s able resolution before the end of next ses- 11 sion. Col. Kowalsky will receive a gratifica- g tlon of ?4,000 in 3 per cent state bonds in the way of indemnity for the work he may ii have done between October next and the t end of the following session." v Memorial of the Missionaries. p It was on April 19, 1904, that Senator r Morgan Introduced into the Senate the first memorial of the missionaries. Senators Morgan and Spooner were appointed a sub- ,t committee to consider It. The memorial b also was introduced into the House. Hear- a lngs were held, but no report was ever made by the committee. In the early part g of 1806 many members of the clergy and a large number of laymen of Michigan re- n quested Representative Denby to urge action by Congress upon the Congo memorial. P In response to their appeal, Mr. Denby J wrote a letter to Secretary Root informing ' the Secretary of the sentiment in his constituency on the Congo atrocities and ask lng what the United States could do to t ameliorate the complained of conditions. In his reply to Mr. Dentoy Secretary Root j took the position that Interference by this government In the Congo would be unwarranted. The ground upon which Mr. Root based his contention that the United States p ought to take no steps to bring about an international inquiry, "with a view to authoritative adjudication of the issues to which the conditions supposed to exist in the Congo Free State are related," was that the United States was not a signatory to II the general act of the Congo, signed at t Berlin, February, 26, 1885, by virtue of J. wmcn JVing l^eupuia gauiua sovereignly over i that vast area of 900,000 square miles, an f area several times as large and four times as populous as the Philippine Islands. Mr. Root's letter to Representative Denby "was printed as a House document. 8 More than any other single influence, per- d haps, it was responsible for no action being a taken by Congress upon the memorial of <s the missionaries asking for intervention. t The American recites a long list of 3 atrfutltfo* in fh# rnnM Allpeed bv mis- d eionaries, Including the charge that the fc soldiers cut off the hands of children to tl imp rets the natives with their power. ' Knows Nothing of the Lobby. Baron Moncheur, the Belgian minister, stated this afternoon that he knew nothing of this alleged lobby either In Washington or elsewhere, and that the first information he received about It was through the press dispatches this morning. Lodge Calls for an Inquiry. Senator Lodge today introduced a resolu tion relative to the Congo Free State. It recites that the report of the Inhuman treatment Inflicted upon the native inhabitants of the Congo Free State has been of. such a nature and so well sustained as to draw the attention of the civilized world and excite both the indignation and the compassion of the people of the United Stated It resolves that In the opinion of the Senate the time has come when the affairs of the Congo Free State should be made the subject of International inquiry, and that the Senate notifies the President that In any otona Via mov Hanm If nrloa r. fo Irn In /?n_ operation with or In aid of any of the powers signatories of the treaty of Berlin which shall seek to ameliorate the conditions of the Congo Free State and redress any evils now existing there he will recleve the Senate's cordial support.
