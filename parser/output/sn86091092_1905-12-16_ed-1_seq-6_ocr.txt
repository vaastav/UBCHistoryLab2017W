It looks better than a darn. If, however, the material frays very much it will prob ably be necessary to draw the rent to gether first with a different colored line cotton and darn It, taking up every other thread. One strand of filoselle of the correct shade should be used, either for darning or for the first-described method. To become an •xpert darner requires patience and good eyesight. BS ft ABY A "Tfar - What does the nervous mother ask .herself In moments when nerves are ■trained by pain or overexcitement of any kind? "Rest!" she chiefly de mands. "Leave me! Let me have quiet, darkness, freedom from effort We açcord the nervous baby exact ly opposite treatment. We answer as If entreated. "Kock me! Toss mel Shake rattle« at me! Sing to me, ■hout, jump at me! Show me a light, anything to keep me awake and ex cltedl" Tradition takes a strong hold In the nursery. It Is voted cruel la difference "to let a baby cry." The ▼ery mother who best recognizes the ▼Blue of "a good cry" in calming her frwu overwrought feelings can least make up her mind to allow the Bam« relaxation to the baby for whose ner vous condition she is probably entirely to blame. The tiny baby's fretfulness is, as a rule, purely physical, and espe cially dependent on overexcited nerves. Any mother who will allow her baby to grow for at least six months of its life in a restful atmosphere, absolute ly unstimulated beyond its natural pace of development, will have food for thought in comparing her results with tliose of the more common train ing. DAMt m The short skirt is shorter than ever. Kilting continues to enjoy populari ty.' Kid gloves of a brilliant brick red are striking. Veils have never been so beautiful nor so necessary. The day of the muslin dress is by no means over yet. A plaid mercerized cotton is nice for fall shirt waists. Great loose-fltting coats suggesting the figure underneath are to be the fashion. A lovely one for slender fig ures. Little boleros of lace edged with far are shown for street wear. Grenat is a new name for vinegar color, which will be worn. Those fluffy ruffs of dotted mallne flt very well with the new hats. There's a popular fancy for wear ing the hair parted and drawn back. Plaited skirts are shown in many variations and they are still the favor ite design. . r The close-fitting bodice now In vogue has created a demand for tallor-flttlng underwear. The tailored shirtwaist is the only one which is permissible with a black tailored skirt. The newest silk stockings have their owner's monogram embroidered just above the knee. Quaint-looking little Red Riding Hood cloaks for small girls are among the newer offerings. No evening gown is completed with out Its gauze scarf, several yards long, of a harmonizing color. The J a panese Woman. The Japanese woman, according to her latest critic, is charming because she is mistress of all the beauty arts. They were hers centuries before the Christian era, and this perhaps is the secret of her wonderful attractiveness. She is always trim, always groomed, always "made up," always well dressed. She is never slovenly or un tidy. The Japanese girl is exquisitely neat Her little garments are abso lutely clean, as clean as many wash ings and frequent airings and shak ings can make them. She wears a silk gown that may be half a century old, bat It Is so carefully kept that It looks as If just from the hands of the em broiderer. She cares little for new clothing, for she has the art of making her old clothes look like new, and this Is everything to her. Rlootnera for Children. Sensible mothers are going to let their little girls wear bloomers with their winter suits. These bloomers may match the stockings or petticoats— thus for instance, a child wearing black shoes will have a pair of black silk or black cashmere bloomers. Where brown shoes and stockings are Worn the bloomers will carry out the color note. It is not so desirable to have the bloomers made of the ma terial of the dress. It is too suggestive of the boy's knickerbockers. The Reposeful Woman. "She is the cleverest woman of my acquaintance," was the verdict of one neighbor on another, "because she is not in the least dull, and yet manages to be restful. I know so many bright women—bright in all sorts of differ ent ways, but all alike in one thing. They are never reposeful. They are Strang up to ' concert pitch. They amuse you, charm you, stimulate you, dazzle you—but they never, never rest you by any chance." Wedding: Superstitions. A bride who finds a spider on her wedding dress may consider herself blessed. The bride who dreams of fairies the night before her marriage will thrice blessed. No bride or bridegroom should be given a telegram on the way to church. Is is a sign of evil. If the bridegroom carries a minia ture horseshoe iji his pocket he will always have good luck. If the wedding ring la dropped dur ing the ceremony the bride may as well wish herself unborn, for she will always have 111 luck. Form of Lace and Taffeta Ribbon. S H -s D .

A simple effective plan for building a picket and wire fence without a ma chine is suggested by G. C. Schneider, of Ava, Mo. He says: A device which will answer the pur pose of a fence machine is made as follows: Take pieces of 2x4 a foot or so long, bore two small holes near the end of each, put the wires through these holes and fasten to post where you wish to begin. Then stretch your wire and staple to post some distance ahead, leaving the staples loose enough so the wire will slip when it is drawn tight. Let eight or ten feet of wire extend beyond the post and to those fasten heavy weights to keep the Z7 rlT" PICKET FENCK DEVICE. wire tight. Put a picket between the wires and turn the blocks over as often as you wish to twist the wire between each picket; then put in another picket and twist the other way, etc. To pre serve posts, mjx pulverized charcoal In boiled linseed oil to the consistency of paint and apply with a brush. Coat of Silase. We'-have from time to time laid be fore our readers the cost of putting corn in the silo* says Farmers' Trib une. Some men are able to grow the corn at a cost of about 50 cents per ton of green matter. They are able to put It in the silo for another 50 cents, making the total cost of the silage In the silo approximately ?1 per ton. Sometimes the cost goes as high as $1.50, sometimes even higher. • Sam Schilling who Is manager of Joel Pheatwole's heard at Northfield, Minn., kept an accurate record of the cost of putting sixteen acres of corn In his silo last year and these figures were given before the Minnesota But ter'Makers' Association this spring by Mr. Schilling. They are as follows: 16 acre» corn at $8 $128 00 Cost of cutting. $1 per acre 10 00 Two men loading fiva days 15 00 Tvro men in silo..., 15 00 Four teams hauling five days.. 60 00 Engine five days and man 25 00 Fuel for engine 16 00 One man to feed machine 10 00 Cost of 200 tons silage $285 00 Cost per ton of silage 1 42% The average yield per acre in this instance was 12.5 tons of green corn. The cost of the ensilage, including the raising, which was estimated at $8 per acre, was a little high. Consulting the table, however, It will be Been that It required four teams hauling for five days top draw fhe corn to the silo per day. This means that the sJUage had to be drawn from some distance or more could have been hauled, but even at $1.50 per ton silage is a very cheap food. Loading Corn Fodder. Loading corn fodder may not be very hard work to the small farmer, but when one has the product of many acres to load it becomes a formidable operation. The work can be much more easily done if the followlfig de vice Is used: Make a loader by using a two-inch plank ten feet long with cleats of inch stuff nailed on one side at short intervals. At one end nail a cleat on the under side, which will be three Inches wider than the board on each side. Tie small ropes to this cleat VJ-E A FOB LOADING COBN FODDEB. and with them fasten the rack to the back part of the wagon rack, the lower end of the plank-rack resting on the ground. This makes a stepladder up which it is easy to walk and if strongly made a man can readily carry up it all he can get his arm around. With this plan one man can do the work of loading a wagon easily without spending the time necessary to bind the bundles. The illustration shows how easily the ladder can be made.—Indianapolis News.

IM n. h., k. !, P far sr M ™ - --Ä Good Ontatde Paint. A substitute for white oil paint may be made as follows: Four quart» of skim milk, 1 pound of fresh slacked lime, 12 ounces of linseed oil, 4 ounces of white Bergundy pitch. 6 pounds of Spanish white, to be mixed «s follows: The lime to be slacked In an Iron ves sel In the open air by pouring water upon it a little at a time until It Is dissolved into a fine dry powder. Put the lime into a wooden bucket or keg and mix it in about one -quarter of the milk; the oil In which the pitch must be previously dissolved over a slow Are and cooled, to be added a little at a time, then the rest of the milk, and afterwards the Spanish white. Mix thoroughly and strain through a common wire milk strainer and it will be ready for use. This quantity Is suf ficient for more than fifty square yards, two coats. By adding a very small quantity of lampblack first dis solved in milk and thoroughly mixed a very handsome lead color can be ob tained. If stone color Is desired, after mixing In the lampblack add a small quantity of yellow ochre and Venetian red separately, first dissolved in milk, While using, stir frequently to keep it In solution. Fall Mulching; of Treea. If it is thought necessary to apply mulch around the base of trees or shrubs as a winter protection care must be used not to do the work too soon, particularly If anything in the nature of a fertilizer is used, such as coarse stable manure, for there Is al ways danger of inciting renewed growth in the tree, just as it Is begin ning to go to sleep for the winter, and this growth, being extremely tender, will be killed by the first cold weather, probably with much injury to the tree. A better plan Is not to apply the mulch until the ground freezes, applying more, if necessary, later on. By far the best plan of all is to use earth with which to protect the roots of the tree or shrub during the first cold days; put It on several Inches thick for three feet "around the tree. Later, If it gets too cold, a little coarse manure may be put on over the soil. By this plan the tree or shrub will have full protection without danger of inciting a late growth. A Good Grindstone. A grindstone to turn with bicycle gear can be made after this cut, writes W. D. Watklns, of Athens, Ohio. Take sprocket wheels and chain off an old GRINDSTONE WITH PEDAL GEAR. binder or dropper. Gear so that stone will turn two revolutions to one of crank. You can grind anything on it with great speed. Grinding Corn for Swine.

Carrying out the plan of keeping the swine husy, we al ways have something for them to chew on—cornstalks, squares of sod, apples, potatoes and other vegetables, and we do not see that they take on fat any slower because of this plan of feeding. Pure water Is given them In clean troughs twice a duy during the winter and we know they thrive bet ter for having it—Excha nge. Cottonaeedaa Fertilizer. Cottonseed meal is used quite exten sively in some sections of the country as a fertilizer. A good grade meal will -•arry about 6.8 per cent nitrogen, 2 8 per cent phosphoric add and 1.8* per cent potash. Based upon the valua tions that will be used by New Eng land experiment stations in 1905 for computing the value of commercial fertilizers, a meal analyzing as above will be worth about $29 a ton as a fertilizer. Notwithstanding its high value when used directly In this way it will usually be found more econom ical to use it as a food for stock and to apply the resulting manure to the land. When ûsed thus, from eighty to luuo , LCOm eigniy to ninety-five per cent of the nitrogen and phosphoric acid and practically all the potash will be contained in the ma nure. „ Corn and OH Meal for Hogs.

The quality of the pork pro duced was unsurpassed, and the ten dency of these feeds to make real growth, as well as fat was greater than that of any other ration tested. One pound of oil meal replaced from t0 Pounds of corn, aocordlnc as it wss fed with five or twenty pounds of corn. Bone meal fed with whole corn effected a marked saving m the grain requUements per pound of gatn. m «prfi President Roosevelt Is mapping 0Q t a lot of work to occupy the attention of Congress when It next assembles. Questions that are of great moment to the business world and the public in general are to be placed squarely be fore the legislators for action. The President's attitude on the railway rate question has not beeu modified since he first directed attention to ths manifest evil that has grown up un der the Insidious system of rebates. Mr, Roosevelt strikes the keynote when he says the highways must bs kept open to all on equal terms. The abuses of thè private car line and the private terminal track and private side switch system must be stopped, the President says. There Is little doubt that the majority of the people echo his sentiments in this regard. If the President has his way, power to revise and regulate rates will be in vested in the Interstate Commerce Commission. Another measure of great Importance that will be recom mended by the President Is a bill to prevent bribery and other forms of corruption In Federal elections. State courts have showed in a lamentable number of instances that they are not beyond the baneful Influence of ward leaders, and attempts to punish vio lators of the sanctity of the ballot box have ignominiously failed. The ab solute purification of politics probably will ever remain an iridescent dream, but there is little doubt that a Fed eral statute, asking the trial of offend ers against the ballot out of the con trol of State courts, would be a long step forward in a commendable ef fort to free the ballot box of fraud Federal control of insurance is another question that will be discussed in the President's message. The disclosures that are being made in the investiga tion in New York have aroused a storm of indignant protest from policy holders who demand that their inter ests Shall be protected and safeguard ed by Federal control. — > The new Anglo-Japanese treat) differs from the earlier treaty In several important particulars. It run« for a period of ten years; It embodies a recognition on the part of Great Britain of the paramount political, military and economic Interesta of Japan in Korea, and on the part of Japan of the right of Great Britain to take such measures as> she may find necessary for safeguarding her Indian possessions; It applies the principle of "the open door" for the commerce of all nations to Korea; and, most Im portant of all, It pledges each power to come to the assistance of the other in war, not merely when its ally Is attacked by two powers, as in the earlier treaty, but when it is Involved in any war in defense of its territorial rights or special interests "in the r» gl on a of eastern Asia and India."
