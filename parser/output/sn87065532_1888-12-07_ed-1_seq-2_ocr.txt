PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, We have received President Cleveland's message to Congress, which was read before that body hi hi M(iiu!;iy, but owing to its great length it i.s impossible for lis to lay it belon1 our leaders in full. We therefore, give a brief syninopsis of I lie document. It is h stales manlike nincr, characteristic of .Mr. Cleveland, the best President the country has had since Wash ington s lime : The bulk of the message, like those of all his predecessors, is taken up wilh the various ques lions presented before Congress by the departments. Mr. Cleveland reviews our foreign relations at length, especially our Canadian difficulty: calls attention to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, pointing out in particu lar the inadvisabilily of purcha sing bonds at a premium, ana touches, in fine, upon a hundred similar matters. These, however, are not the distinclive features of his message, as his introduction is, wherein, taking advantage of the fact that this ii (he one Jiundredtli anniversary of tnir adoption of the Federal Constitution, he reviews I he condition of the country to-day, points out the dangers that menace our institutions and utters a warn ing that deserves the fullest con sideration. The President takes, perhaps, a somewhat too gloomy view of the situation. We do not believe that I he country is in as bad acondition as his diagnosis shows; but none the less, his warning is timely and to the point, and shows dangers ahead which cannot be denied and which we must avoid. The contest and bitlerness be tween capital and hi bur, I lie growth and power of the trusts, the dispo sition to seek Federal aid for pri vate enterprise, and the Federal interference in local affair are, he declares, existing evils that are draining the life blood of the coun try, biiihlini: up classes in America and undermining and destroying its institutions. ( Most of these evils can be avoid ed, he points out, by a reduction in our revenue, and especially by a reduction in our tarilF rales. If less money was taken, Irom the people, and less surplus lying idle in the treasury, there would be less disposition to appeal to the Feder al government for assistance to purely local or individual enter prises, less chance to acquire great fori ones, less opportunities for trusts and monopolies. The Pre.-i-deiit strongly backs up his former Ir.nfF message by his hist one to Congress, which is more emphatic thr.n anything else he has had to say on the subject. Mr. Cleveland has evidently not changed his views on the InriiT in consequence of his defeat ; And in probably his last public message he warns us, in the revi.-ion of our tariff laws and the reduction of our revenues the necessity for which is now conceded by all to see to it that the question of the direct benefit to our citizens be the chief point considered, and that no scheme be accepted as satisfactory by which the burden of die people are only apparently relieved. Mr. Cleveland brings the tariff question before the country again and leaves it there for discussion and settlement. Godfrey La fond arrived home from the Soulh, where he has been lor the past five or six years, last Saturday evening. He has been fishing alonglhe Gulf Coast during his absence and has had a varied experience and the usual fisher man's luck. His wife came back some mouths ago and now he has followed her back, bidding a long farewell to the Sunny South anil it's shiny niggers. We clip the above from the Chronicle, published at Two Rivers, Manitowoc county, Wisconsin. Godfrey La fond sojourned at this place about a year, and there were no tears shed at his departure. He was proprietor of the lotcett beer den in town ; had become a con stant menace to the peace and good order of the town, and as a part of the ret gestie of a hoodlum pow-wow, mysteriously disappear ed. It Two Rivers can furnish us no better Caucasians than such unsavory characters as arch hood lum Godfrey Lafond, we trust the charms of (he Sunny South will never beguile another of them across Mason and Dixon's Line. To such we much prefer the "ehiny niggers." Capt. R. D. Smith" advertises in the Ukmoceat Stab this week that he has some oranges lor sale at 11.50 per hnndred. Gov. Low hx appoinied Mr. C. II.

S E1 it or Doinucrut-Hlur : Wo are having pretty cold weather, with the bright side up because the sun shines. As this, the 2!)ih day of November, has been set apart by Grover Cleve land, President of tho United Slates, as a day of Thanksgiving and praise to Almighty God for his tender niercv extended to us as a powerful and prosperous nation, and to thank him who rules su preme for the abundant harvests which have rewarded the toil of the husbandmen during the year that has past, and for the rich re wards that followed the labors of our people in their shops and in their marls of trade and traflic. We are equally thankful to Al mighty God for lree speech and free press, that we can battle against the power of corruption and freebooters, where and when the face ol guile is seen, from the President of the United States down to a constable. Licev. on the N. O, and N. L. R. R., is on a boom. Seme enterpri sing Georgians have started there, in addition to the turpentinery ol C. W.

Also Mr Leek and some other gen tleman are erecting a saw mill, which will soon be in operation when thev will saw some of C. W. Roberson's trees into lumber. We have some youns game cocks in this viciniiy. we nave jlisi learned that Lawrence Ladnier and Calvin Shaw, two able bodied young men, tried their manhood at mauling on each other yesterday until seuarated by friends.

A' dispatch from Gainesville,Texas, November 2Sih, sas : Great excitement was caused to day in the Court room over a fight between A.M. Thoniason and J. L. Harris, two prominent lawyers of the Gainesville bar. I'lie diffi culty grew out of a dispuie which arose while they were trying a case. Soon after the biliigerenis were separated ihey left I he Court-room, riiomason going lo the foot of the stairs. Harris came up shortly, when the dispute came up again, which ended in Harris shooting at Tliomason with a large pistol, the ball passing over his head, missing ils mark. Thomason retreated back into his cilice, and the fray ended by a deputy sheriff taking charge of Harris, Both parties are hot-blooded and when aroused are considered dangerous. Further trouble ol a serious nature is ex pected. Harris is a son-in-law of Gov. I) wry of Mississippi, and a few years ago was assistant Attorney-General of that State. He has lived here two years. No Negro Need Applv. There will probably be a Soul hern man in the Cabinet of President Harri son, And if there should be, he will undoubtedly be a fair repre sentative of ali that is best aud most progressive in that region. The same unquestionably will be true of all ot President Harrison's other Appointments ol Southern men. There are dozens of men of this class in every Southern State. Let Southern Democrats cease pawing the air and resume their ordinary business employments. No Republican desires"negrorulc" in the South, nor will the old Car petbager element ever be put for ward again by the Republican par ty. (J lobe-Democra t. The above from the Globe-Democrat, one of the rankest and strong est of Bourbon Republican journ nals would indicate that so far os the Republicans are concerned Cuffey will continue to stay in the political wood pile. No reward lo given the negro for his votes in the past no care for how he may cast them in the future. O, Ingratitude, how fathomless are thy waters! Xeto Miiippia. The next thing to be dona is for the electors chosen by each State to meet at the Capital of their re spective States and cast their bal lots lor President snd Vice-President and send their returns to Washington. The law prescribes that they shall assemble on the second Monday in January, which falls this year on the 14th,' and that the voting shall be by ballot. The result being declared, a mes senger is chosen lo carry the re turns to Washington, where they are deposited, one copy with the President of V:e Senate and one wilh the Secretary of State. We direct especial attention of those who need cisterns to the ad advertisement of Mr. B. F. Browne, a first-class cistern builder, who has opened a shop over in New Venice, west side of Pancagoula river, where he is prepared lo mao ufaclure, on short notice, cisterns of clear seasoned cypress, at very reasonable prices.
