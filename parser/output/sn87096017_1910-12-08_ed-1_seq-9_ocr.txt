Washington, Dec. 7.—Congress gave respectful attention to President Taft's message, but there were comparative ly few members who were willing to concede the probability of favorable action, at the present session on many of the recommendations contained therein. The general ^pinion was that time would not permit of action in view of the fact that the session will close March 4. Prior to the cabinet meeting Presi dent Taft deVoted an hour to seeing congressional callers. Probably his most interesting vis itor was Representative-elect Caleb Powers of Kentucky, who was con victed three times of complicity in the Goebel murder case. Mr. Powers was introduced to the president toy Senator Bradley, who declared that the new member of congress had been vindicated by the heaviest vote ever given a congressman in his district President Taft will devote most of the remainder of this week to con ferences with senators, representa tives and men of prominence regard ing the Judicial appointments which he Is expected to send to the senate next week.
