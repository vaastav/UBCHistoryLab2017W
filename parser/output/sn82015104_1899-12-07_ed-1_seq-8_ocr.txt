Relating to Foreign Freight Pass ing Through This Country. SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. fi—The Treasury Department at Washington has just made a ruling that has caused great perturbation in railroad circles, as the effect of the ruling will be to deprive the transcontinental lines of a large quantity of freight business, which will be transferred by reason cf the ruling to the Canadian Pacific and the Panama route. Heretofore shipments of merchandise made from Liverpool or other Euro pean ports designed for the Asiatic seaboard have been sent by steamer to New York, thence across the continent by rail to San Francisco, and thence by steamer from this port to the Asia tic port of destination. Only such shipments come by this route as are to fill hurry-up orders. The goods have been allowed to pass through this country without hindrance or added expense. But the new ruling of the Treasury Department requires all such shipments to be delayed for appraise ment at New York or San Francisco, and if the appraisement should be higher than the invoice value, a duty penalty must be paid, which will not be refunded on exportation.

WASHINGTON, Dec. o.—General Otis to-day cabled the War Department that he has had no word from General j Young for a week. This is taken to | indicate that Young is connubttg his i hot pursuit of Aguinaldo, and probabl\ is in a country where he regards it as unsafe to use couriers. General Otis' dispatch,, which follows, also gives an official account of Lieutenant Colonel Parker's engagement at Vigan: "Manila. Dec. t>. —General Young, with thirteen companies of infantry and nine trcons of cavalry, has not ! been heard from since the 20th ultimo, j He was then about twenty miles lof Vigan, and most of the trooDS ' marching to his support, but he then i had with him three troops of cavalry ! and a battalion of the Thirty-third In [ fantry sent by boat to Vigan to rein | force the navy there. Lieutenant Col onel Parker of the Forty-fifth reports from Vigan, on the sth inst that he has not heard from Y T oung for a week.

G.—Relative to the rumor from Hongkong that Aguin aldo is willing to surrender to L'nited States Consul Wildman, it ig learned 1 that though the Consul himself has j cherished that belief for some months | past, the Government here has been i without any assurance of the sound ness of hia conclusion. Mr. Wildman is not the only official representing the Government in the Far East who has expressed confidence in his ability to persuade Aguinaldo to cease hostili ties, but for some reason the Admin istration has always been somewhat skeptical as to these undertakings. This report from Hongkong is bdlieved to be nothing more than a revival of some of the old rumors. M'KINLEY'S STATE PAPER. ! Received by All Classes of Cubans With Much Satisfaction. HAVANA, Dec. fi.—President McKin ley's message to Congress has been re ceived by Cubans of all classes with much satisfaction. Even the leaders of the extreme party admit this, and the announcement that there will be no American civil Governor has cleared away the clouds that had been hanging over the Cuban political situation. The "Lucha" alone among the papers still favors a civil Governorship. General Collaso says: "The message will pacify the country. The President's statements are not very concrete, but if Congress guarantees the independ ence of Cuba we need not ask for any specification as to the time for the re moval of the American troops, although everybody would be glad to see the black troops go, because of the ex cesses they commit. Cubans fear the Administration, but they do not fear Congress. The Administration repre sents the trusts. Although Cubans are as good business men as Americans, they could not compete with the enor mous power of the trusts, which, by creating monopolies, would eventually enslave the workingman. We wish to see each man owning some property, at least enough to make it worth his while to behave as a good citizen should, instead of going to the woods." Gualberto Gomez said: "I had ex pected the message to be encouraging, but I had not expected such clearness of thought. Congress will go further, and will justify the hope of the Cuban people." The "Discussion" says: "President McKinley's message will fill the hearts of all lovers of Cuba with joy. His words, 'Whatever be the outcome we must see to it that free Cuba be a reality, not a name,' should be written in leters of gold over the door of the Cuban White House. The Cuban re public will be bound to Lincoln and McKinley by indissoluble bonds of love." The "Patria" says: "Hurrah for Pres ident McKinley! He could not have spoken in clearer tones. It is impossi ble for the giddiness of conquest to overpower the deep, natural impulse of a noble and democratic people." The "Cubano" says: "The message contains the clearest words yet spoken by President McKinley, and shows that jutice is the guiding principle at Wash ington. Our hearts, hitherto bowed down by tremendous skepticism, are now relieved, and we may expect Con - gress to speak still more clearly." 

WELL RECEIVED ALSO IN MEX ICO. CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. 6. — The cordial tone of President McKinley's allusions to Mexico in his message to Congress were well received here, where the message was read with great inter est; also his remarks on trusts, as trade combinations are being made here, for it seems probable that the industrial combinations will be one of the most important phases of the business situa tion in this country. President Mc- Kinley's frank declaration that the Isl and of Cuba is being held in trust for the Cuban people, and that the United States Government intends honestly carrying out the intentions of its Con gress, declared at the outset of the war, causes favorable comment, and it is believed that the same sentiment will be expressed throughout Latin- America, awakening friendly feelings for the great northern republic. 

GRAND ARMY OF REPUBLIC. Annual Encampment to Be Held at Chicago August 28th. CHICAGO, Dec. 6.—The National Council of the Grand Army of the Re public, meeting here to-day with the local general committee, agreed on August 2Sth to September Ist as the date of the next annual encampment, which will be at Chicago. In the general discussion of the coun cil it was agreed that the encampment should be held at some time during the public school vacation, that the public schools might be used as sleep ing Quarters for members. It was said by members of the committee that there were many veterans who might wish to attend the encampment who could not stand the financial bur den of paying bills at crowded hotels. At other encampments tents have been used, but the committee deems it more advisable to use the school buildings. The members of the committee called on Mayor Harrison at the close of the morning session. Mayor Harrison urged that the encampment be made non-partisan in every detail, and sug gested that inasmuch as President Mc- Kinley would be present, the Democrat ic Presidential nominee be also invited. This will be done.
