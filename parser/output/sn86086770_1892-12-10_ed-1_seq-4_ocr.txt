Sporadic cases of cholera are continually occurring in all the infected districts of Europe. There should b* s} •ii* ** prompt work in congress in the wav of protection from the dreaded scourge. 'I iik Mormon question seems in a fair way of settling itself. Secretary Noble, in the annual repori of the Department <*f the Interior, ex presses the opinion that the Mor mons appear to be honest in their expressed intention to abandon polygamy.

Mb raukee Sentinel: There is nothing unpatriotic in the liepub liean dtrnand that the Democrats carry out their pledges. Republi cans merely wish the public to have a chance l*> compare Republican performance with Democratic per- formaline. In the last election Re publican performance had to be compared with Democratic promises, beside which nothing cmibi look brilliant. JiiimiNO from reports from Washington siiMM* the meeting of cnrijjnni, the prospects for an extra session mmhi after the 4th of March next are brighter than they have been at any previous lime. The demand, however, will meet with stubborn opposition from those who are not in lull accoid with the views id free-traders respe 'ting the tariff, and there is a large number of them in the victorious party. A definite opinion can be formed soon after the present congress gets fairly to w 01 k. Tiik subject of an income tax is receiving ninth attention just now, because it has been proposed as a means for supplying revenue in case there is a radical reduction of the tariff. The country tried this kind ol tax at the close of the war, in and the trial was not satisfactory to any bod}. It was regarded, and with no little of justice, as an in quisitorial scheme, and as directly calculated to promote false swear ing, since a man’s income is some* tiling which ew hut himself know. It is not tangible or visible. The measure will not prove popular. The President’s Message. The last annual message of Presi dent Harrison to congress will be found in full in this issue of the Thuujnk, and it will amply repay a careful perusal. Like all the pre ceding piq ers of the president it is clear, explicit and comprehensive. It , <resents i complete review of the general > mdition of the oou ti tty and the operations of the gov ernment for the past year, and no- where can so much information respecting public affairs be found in so compact a form. This is a peculiarity <>f all of President Harri son’.- stale papers, and they are for that reason far more interesting to the general reader than similar pa pers usually are. There are many subjects of un usual importance and interest to the public, that find instructive treat ment in the message, notably the silver question, statistics of the material growth of the country and of the commerce of the great lakes. From these it appears that the tonnage passing through the Detroit river in about nine months of the year is 21,034,000 —more than double that of Liverpool and nearly double that of London for a whole year. There is no deficit in the treasury but a surplus of several millions. | Views of a Randall Democrat. Inter Ocean. Mr. Georg*.* Ticknor ( 'unis, win* though he voted againt Cleveland, is a Democrat, hut of the Randall school, has, since the election, ad dressed a letter to the American Tariff League, in which he says several things pertinent to the past of Democracy and to the future- of Republicanism. Relative to Democratic action concerning the tariff he says: ily sheer misrepresentation ami by appeals to the low prejudices of the so-called “poor” against the so-called "rich” the present Demo cratic leaders have persuaded Urr* majorities or pluralities to go against the best Interest of the Nation. '1 his shows how much the people of this country still need to be educated politically on this great public question. The ‘opposed ' poor” must learn to conquer their 1 'Cjudlces. They must learn that there is no other country lu the world in wh:eh wealth Is so generally diffused as it is in this; mid that, properly speaking, we have no poor excepting the paupers who are supported by private charily or at the public expense, a man who has a capacity to labor—who lias muscle, man ual skill, intelligence, and experience in a calling Is in a Just sense a capitalist. To call him a "poor” man is to degrade him to the level of the inmates of a workhouse. VTct there are thousands and thousands who do not. realize this, atm who allow the demagogues of our land to treat them as If there were a natural antagonism between them and the classes who arch-ailed "rich.” I know so well many of the men who foisted the anti-protection plunk Into the Chicago plat form that 1 have no difficulty in Judging of their motives. They are not free trailers on conviction. They went upon the principle of "anything to heal the Republicans and gain political |M)Wcr,” thereby manifesting a lack of all principle. They raised the ialse cry that a protective tariff is both unconstitutional and undemocratic. They debauched the minds of great numbers of people with false ideas, and brought about this great polltcal change, to the injury oftnevery voters whom they had persuaded to 1 >tul themselves to their schemes' I bis uMjitoKiioniibly is true, and it is true nisi) that the tricksters wiio “are not free traders in convic tion,” hut who have been successful in deceiving the peo| le, especially the “so-called poor people,” into believing what they themselves knew to he nnirue concerning the effect of | roteetion, now arc anxious that the Republicans in Congress shall save the I h inocrats in Con gress from the necessity of fulfilling the promises made in their National platform, ami reiterated by their newspapet sand orators during the campaign. The 1 Icinooriiis are pledged to a free trade policy, hut arc anxious to avoid redemption of their pledge. It Would suit them admirably were they able to go to the people in 1594 and 189(h*wilh a pretense that they have been pre vented from keeping their promise “by the Republican majority in one of the branches of Congress.” lut, and as we think fortunately, there is not likely to he a Republi can majority in either branch of Congress. Mr, Curtis, however, thinks otherwise, and ways: I notice that certain Republicans have ex pressed he hope that the Democrats will Rain a majority In the Senate so that the experi ment of free trade can bo tried. They think it will fall, and that the Republican party will thus regain power, which they will thereafter hold for a long course of years. I do not like such laellcs. They l>ear to close n reset iblanee to the tactics of your adversaries. They went lor free trade in order to gain p.dltlcul power. You are advised to go to; free trade, temp oral lly. in order to recover the power you have lost. I do not wish the experimen. c f free trade to he tried for this or any other purpose. This if not a country in which It should be tried, lor it will inevitably result in in incalcu lable loss of National and Individual wealth and in great injury to the laboring people who are employed in all kinds of manufactures. We, no more than Mr. Curtis, de sire “the experiment of free trade to be tried in this country.” We are as firmly convinced as he is that the experiment will be attended by almost unimaginable suffering, especially to the “so-called poor,” who under it will become the really poor. But it is not a question as to what we desire. “Unsettled questions have no pity on the repose of na tions.” The tariff question must be settled, and it seems as if it can be settled only through the fiery ordeal of a free trade experiment. The unbounded prosperity that piu tection bus brought to the country hits not settled it. Demagogues have told the people that the pros perity is illusive, and the people have believed them. Tricksters who had no expectation of the possibility of Democratic ascendency in ill the co-ordinate branches of the government have assured the peo ple of wonderfully increased pros perity under a Democratic policy of free trade, and the people have be lieved them. One taste of the hitter draught that flows from the free trade alembic will cause a de sire to return to and permanently abide by the cool, sweet waters of protection. It is not from desire Of temporary victory in 181*4 or 181*6 that some Republicans rejoice in the cem pleteness of the Democratic ma jority in Loth houses of Congress, hut from drsire of such permanent solution of the tariff controversy a will take it out of party politics. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular correspondent. Washington. I). C.. Dec. 5, !;!. From the talk of Senators and Representatives, many of whom are already here, it is apparent that the session of Congress which begins to-day is to be much more interest ing than had been generally sup posed. Some Democrats are already expressing the fear that the Re publican Senate may take up and pass the “pop-gun” tariff bills passed by the House at the last session, placing wool and other articles on the free list, which, if signed by the President, would make that Treasury deficit, which Democratic success at the polls has made a strong proba bility for the next fiscal year, an absolute certainty. The fears are | however, groundless; the Republi can Senators are too patriotic to vote against their honest convictions merely to add to the troubles, which already promise to he great enough, heaven knows, of the Democratic administration and Congress. Impecunious Congressmen are re joicing over the prospect of the presence of a big lobby in Wash ington during this session, to fight the bill which will be reported by the Senate Committee on Immi gration, providing for a suspension of immigration for a period of one year from March 1, 1893. Should ltiin bill become a law it would cauHe an immense loss to the Iran 8- Atlantic steamship companies which derive a very large revenue from the immigration traffic, and it is these companies which are organiz ing this lobby, and which will supply it witli all the money needed to influence voles against the bill. Another lobby will also be here, indeed its advance agents are al ready here, but its work will he entirely with the Senate, which has very few impecunious members, consequently its presence does not excite so much interest. It is com posed of representatives of the great grain ami cotton exchanges, and is here for the purpose of pre venting the passage of the anti option bill, which passed the House last session, and which Senator Washburn has given notice that he will call up in tin* S-mate and push to a vote at the earliest opportunity. A formidable number of Demo crats aided by the the third party members are working up a senti ment in the House in favor of the passage of a bill providing for an income lax ar 1 they claim to have gotten almost enough pledges to secure its passage; but as Speaker Crisp dominates the House commit tee on Rules, and he is anxious to curry favor with Mr. Cleveland, who is opposed to an income tax, and no lull opposed by that commit tee can be brought to a vote in the House, it is regarded as doubtful whether the bill can be passed by the House. It is certain that it would not pass the Senate. If the Democrats who are clamor ing for an early extra session of the Fifty-third Congress continue to gain recruits at the present rale Mr. Cleveland will find it difficult to refuse their demands, whatever he may think about it. Speaker Crisp, although he professes public ly to be undecided, is in reality working as hard as he knows how to bring about an extra session. It is pure unadulterated selfishness with him; he wants to be Speaker again, and having been a Hill man, he fears that if the election of Speaker be postponed until the regular session Mr. Cleveland will have an opportunity to make com binations that would result in the election of a Cleveland Speaker. The latest and most sordid argu ment yet advanced for an extra; session is that the Democrats could then admit New Mexico and Ari zona to Statehood and have four more Democratic Senators at the opening of the regular session mak ing them independent of the votes of the third party Senators.
