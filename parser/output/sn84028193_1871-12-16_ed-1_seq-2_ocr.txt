AISKAX6AS. A horrible tragedy occurred on Mul berry Creek, Franklin county, on Sun day "last. Kichard Hill, a farmer, had in his employ as farm hands two young men aged sixteen and eighteen respect ively, named Joseph Forbish and 11 liam Chenowerth. They formed a plan to rob the house, aud in order to carry out their scheme, after eating their din ner, as usual, J-orbisli went out to cliop some wood. While doing so a little lour years old girl came out. Presently he picked up the child and started off with her toward the creek, where he was soon joined by Chenoweth, and after proceed ing some mstanee lrom tne nouse uiey cruelly murdered her, and threw the bodj" into the deep pool of the creek. When the child was missed by its par ents, the father and neighbors commenc ed a diligent search. It was at this time that the murderers expected to rob the house, while all the family were absent, but Mrs. Hill remained at home. After searching all night, the body of the mur dered child was found in the creek with the neck broken, and the body horribly mutilated. Suspicion at once fell upon Forbish and Chenoweth, and they were arrested, when they made a full confes sion, and while the two were being tak en to jail, and attempting to escape, they were both killed in- the guard.

This may, perhaps, arise from an inability to appreciate and fellow the subtle chain of reasoning by which the writer reaches his conclusions, but more probably springs from somewhat natural doubts as to the "candid and truthful statements" contained in it. The article is long occupying over three columns but the results at which it arrives can lie summed tip in a few words. According to the yiews of the writer, any test to which a medium Is subjected and which incoutrovertibly proves the manifesta tion to bea fraud aud trick, must be ac cepted as positive proof that the phenom ena are from a spiritual source And the logic is as peculiar as the deduction. Because, in a certain seance, it is impos sible to see how the medium performs the At the opening of Congress, there was the usual crowding ot galleries of both Senate and House. Members and Sena tors were early in their seats and there was a general greetingamongold friends. The call of the roll showed that more than a quorum of Members was present The Senate was also full. The usual committees to wait on the President, and inform him that Congress was in session and ready to receive any communication he had to make, were appointed iu both Houses. Jir. Dawes ottered the motion iu the House. A recess was then taken so as to allow the committee time to re- jiort. The Speaker soon after called the roll and announced the standing com mittees of the House for the. present ses sion. The following are the chairman ships of the leading committees: Klec- tions, McCrary of Iowa: Ways and Means, Dawes; Appropriations, Gar field ; Banking and Currency, Hooper of Massaciutssetts; Pacific Jfcuiroad, vt iieel- erot New York; Claims, Blair of Mich igau; Commerce. Sliellabarger ; Public feats, although every test shows that he Imds, Ketchnm of New York : Post- or she does perform them, therefore it innst be admitted that they arc perform ed by spirits. To illustrate more fully, we subjoin the following account of a "circle," taken from the article in ques tion: When the committee met they "were placed, as usual, on two sides and one end of a long table, with their hands all joined together, so that no break in the circle could occur, without at. least two persons being cognizant of it. Mrs. Chamberlain was seated in a chair at the other end of the table, with her dress tacked to the floor, whilst both the hands of each of the persons sitting next to her ( Mr. Colby be ing one of them and an equally reliable person the other) were formed alter the usual manner in a pack, with one of the hands of each of the persons w ho sat next them between, lie lore taking his seat in the circle Mr. Colby stepped out of the room and brought in a pair of drum-sticks, the handles of which he had iimknovrii to the medium and most or all of the others present) previously blackened with print ter's ink; and also several other instru ments of music, hells, &c which lie had also striped nml dotted at appropriate places (severally) with red. blue and jtreen ink. These 'were laid in a place be yond the possible reach of the medium, and Mr. ('., having taken his place, the light was turned off. as is usual on such occasions, bolh Mrs. Chamberlain's hands were constantly engaged in manipulating with gentle touches the pack of hands on either side of her, in order ( as the theory 1s) to draw magnetic1 power from the whole circle (linked together as before describ ed). The company being of "one accord"' and harmonious, the manifestations were good, accompanied with the usual beating oftlie big drum and the performance in the air (as they sailed overhead around the room) of the bells anil lesser instruments of music. When the seance closed, a committee of ladies was appointed to ex amine the medium and learn whether any marksf otiierthnn those already perceived p were made by the coloring matter on her person. They reported that, besides the stains of printer's ink on her hands visible to all as were also sundry marks on the neck that other spots and lines of red, blue and green (corresponding to those on the instruments) were found on different parts or her person. Now to ordinary minds, such acts would be conclusive proof of trickery, and the mere inability to detect the hw ilus operandi, would not lie taken as evi dence of supernatural influence. But the writer declares these things to be the strongest proof of the spiritual origin of the drumming and bell-ringing, and, with clear, conducive logic reasons it all out, as follows : In creating materialising, ewlmninij or e.r temporistnt, as it. were, tlie occult hand, body or spiritual form or instrument by which physical manifestations are accom plished, it was necessary that certain ele- oflices, Farnsworth ; Indian Altai.

It is quite voluminous. The letter of Fish to Minister Curtin, dated Nov states that on his arrival Catacazy gave promise of being a useful and very acceptable minister, and made an agreeable impression. Soon, howev er, he began to make himself very offi cious, interfering in questions not ap propriately connected with his legation, and in those pending before Congress importuning Senators and Representa tives, and resorting to personal inter views aud solicitations unusual on the part of representatives of other powers accredited to this government, distaste ful and annoying to the legislators thus indecorously approached, and tending to em harass the tree course ot legislation on subjects with respect to w hich his in terference was directed. Jle did hesitate to use tlie newspapers of country to influence public opinion upon questions lMMidmg before tne govern ment, and indulged iu much license in his denunciations ot measures and md viduals. in ins conversation lie was even more severe and unrestrained, anil employed abusive and vituperative lan guage toward very many persons, in cluding several in public positions and enjoying the respect aud confidence of the community. 1 he impropriety of a lorcign minister t'jus attempting to in lluence and misdirect the public opinion of the country must be admitted as suffi cient ground for his ceasing to be a pro) er agent between the government which he represents anil that to which he was accredited. The correspondence contains proofs showing the truth of the statements ot the Secretary, and othc matters of public interest. The House Appropriation Committee ordered the hau-man to rciwrt a bill making an appropriation of four biin- ured ami littv thousand dollars to com pb.'te the expense of taking the censu: The whole cost will be two millions, which is nearly n million in excess of the last census.

It announc es that the British government has been notified of the intention of France to abrogate the treaty of commerce at. the stipulated time, but that France will not discontinue the negotiations for a re arrangement of her commercial relations with Kngland. The deputies are warned never to forget to what depths the wretchedness of the Empire had led the country. France should now look for complete recognizatioii to God and to time. It was her policy to endure her dignified peace. Should a war occur, despite her determination to remain at peace, it should not be her deed. France must resume the position to which she was entitled, not only for her own good, but in the interest of all nations. France sympathizes with the people in the maintenance of his spiritual inde pendence and will in case of need give the Holy Father a vigorous supjwrt. The utmost cordiality is manifested to ward Austria, for whose prosperity fer vent hope is expressed. The relations of France with Itussia, says the Presi dent, are those of reciprocal interests. Thiers deplores the indebtedness of the country, but says it is due to the machi nations of the Emperor Napoleon. The President advocates the establishment; of general compulsory military service in war lime, and purposes the limitation of tho annual contingent to thirty thousand men in time of peace. The message concludes with an expression of confi dence in tlie patriotism of the Assembly. The National Assembly adopted, by a vote of 80 to 277, the recommendation from the committee having in charge the subject, for alienation to the store of the crown jewels. The weather is intensely cold, and the mercury in the thermometer on Wednes day indicated 21 1 j degrees below zero, centigrade. The river Seine is tightly frozen over, and a heavy fall of snow impedes railroad trarlic. In the Assembly a motion was made by M. Duehatel for removal of the As sembly and scat of government to Paris. The motion gave rise to an animated de bate, which promised to he a protracted one, although there is little doubt that the proposal has a majority of the Cham ber in its favor. The appeals of the Coniniunist-s con victed of the murder of licnerals lx'--Compte and Thomas, aud sentenced to sutler death, have been rejected by tho Commission of Pardons. There is no hope that Thiers will Interpose to remove this final decision. A special despatch from Paris says tin; situation in France is grave. The Oi lcans Princes are pushing things. Ou Tuesday they sought the advice of Theirs a I Knit taking their scats, but ho assured them that their presence in the Assembly would arouse many animosities, that, the moment was inopportune aud that the Bomipartist, Bed Jtcpuhlicuii and Legiti mate journals would clamor that, the ttcpublie was menaced. The Prince answered that they would not act with out further consideration. There was no misunderstanding but Thiers showed extreme anxiety to prevent the Princes from taking their scuts. Tin' same night the Commission 011 Abrogation of the Ln w of Kxile met, and should they ab rogate that law the Princes will undoubt edly, cnler the Chamber. Theirs, re garding this a menace to Ihu Bcpublic, will present a proposition for a definite ltepublicau Oovernineiu. it is believed Cheese Choice factory 13lSic Kaos At 28(g30.
