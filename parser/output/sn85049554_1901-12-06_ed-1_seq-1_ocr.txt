First 8ession of the Minority's Steer ing Committee Not Harmonious. Washington, Dec. 6.—The first session of the democratic steering committee of the house was not productive of har mony. It assembled at a dinner given by Representative Newlands, of Ne vada, one of the members. The full committee was not present, but Repre sentative Richardson, of Tennessee, the tiembcratic leader of the house, Cum mlngs of New York, Swanson of Vir ginia, Thayer of Massachusetts, Will iams of Illinois, Williams of Mississippi and Hay of Virgina, who enjoyed the re past, discussed informally the questions which have been Intrusted to them for solution. Senator Dubois was also a guest, invited as an expert on the silver question, and freely expressed his opin ion at the solicitation of members of the committee. A strong feeling developed adverse to binding the democrats to caucus action and in favor of leaving them free to de cide for themselves the position they shall take on the leading issues. It de veloped that a majority of the commit tee do not regard free silver as a popu lar or live Issue at this time, Senator Dubois as umpire sustaining the claim that it has lost its effectiveness in the west, owing to changed conditions, The tariff, the majority believe, Bhould be choseh as an Issue that would mar shal'the full democratic strength, while the trusts and the Philippines with nu merous less important questions would furnish ample ammunition for the next congressional campaign. Several of the members resented the idea that Tam many after being beaten and discredited at the polls should attempt at this time to control the party. Another meeting of the committee will be held in a few days, when if all the members be present formal action will be taken and a policy of action during the present session will be outlined. TO 

CONFIRM KNOX. Senate Judiciary Committee Author izes Favorable Report on His Ap pointment. Washington, Dec. 6.—The senate com mittee on Judiciary today authorized a favorable, report upon the nomination of Hon. P. C. Knox to be attorney gen eral. Opposition to the confirmation was made by the anti-trust league, "which has filed a protest with the com mittee, in which especial complaint is made that Knox failed to bring certain suits against corporations said to be trusts which he was urged by the league to^ Institute. The Tariff Not Affected. Washington, Dec. 6.—A number of matters were discussed at the cabinet meeting today, but none of special im portance. It developed that the gov ernment Is convinced the decisions of the supreme court in the insular cases do not In any way disturb the Philip pine tariff and the government will con tinue to collect customs duties as here tofore. Iowa Federal Appointments. Des Moines, Dec. 6.—The Leader says: Government officials, who are greatly interested in the result of the Iowa con gressional delegation's meeting to cau cus on federal appointments, claim to have information to the effect that the caucus will not be held until after the bolitay recess. They think tbere is no Hi question about the positions other than those of collector of revenues in the two districts. In the northern district J. U. Sammis is a candidate for the dfstrict attorney ship against the present incumbent, H. G. McMillan, of Cedar Rapids. Mr. Mc Millan was appointed from the Eleventh district when he was a resident of Rock Rapids, and his cause was championed by George D. Perkins, now retired and who has been succeeded in congress by Lot Thomas, of Storm Lake. Mr. Sammis claims,,that the appoint ment belongs to the telkventh, and by removing to Cedar Rapids, in the Fifth, Mr. McMillan has placed himself.out of the reach of the plum. Sammins has the support of Congressman Thomas, but it Is understood he will have difil culty in persuading other members of Uie delegation to see it his way. The other members are disposed to believe, however, that the Fifth is not entitled to two district appointments. Collector Patterson is also a resident of Cedar Rapids. As a result It is claimed by the well-informed ones that an attempt ir. to be made to patch up a truce be tween Sammis and McMillan by giving Sammis the collectorship. In short, it is known that such an attempt was made at the preliminary caucus held last winter. At that time Mr. Sammis was not disposed to accept the compromise. He Is an attorney and argued that he would not feel that he was being com pensated by accepting a position as col lector that he could hope to improve his condition only thru an appointment that would further him In his profe ssion. Whether he has changed his atti tude is not known, but the Indications are that he 19 still after McMillan's berth. He has been in Washington re cently on his mission, and some corre spondence that, has passed between his friends and members of he delegation would indicate that he still wants the attorneyship or nothing. It was suggested by a federal office holder yesterday that the delegation might, in the event Sammis refuses the consolation prize, give it to another Eleventh district man. The appoint emnt of Tenth district man is consid ered out of the question, because of the berths now held by republicans from that district. In the southern district there is little or no doubt but George M. Christian will be reappointed marshal and that Louis Miles, of Corydon, will get the district attorneyship for another four years.' Harry O. Weaver, late chairman of the state central committee, Is a can didate for the district attorneyship, but it is claimed on excellent authority that he can not hope to receive more than two votes in the caucus. The general opinion seems to be that Collector Kem ble will have difficulty in securing a re appointment, tho as yet there Is nothing definite as to the attitude of members of the delegation toward him. It ia claimed that with respect tofbls office the situa tion is similar to that la the northern dlstrlct-aha thaTthe 'HtpbiirTv'influence, which is for Miles, Is willing to sacrifice Kemble if the collectorship will quiet the opposition and give Miles a unani mous endorsement. 

STOOD OFF THE POLICE. Demented Convict Gives Officers Merry Chase in London. London, Dec. 6.—The convict at Pen tonville prison, who managed to elude the wardens' yesterday established him self on the roof of the Institution and defied all attempts to dislodge him for forty hours, but hunger finally forced him to surrender. He was lured to the ground! by the offer, of a dish of roast beef and potatoes. Thousands of spec tators watched the show and aidedithe prisoner by timely warnings of the movements of would be captors. Lad ders placed against the wall were promptly thrown down, by the prisoner. He pelted the officers with slate which he tore from the roof of the building and they retreated. The convict is be lieved to be demented as all his move ments and actions were accompanied by demonical laughter, executed in the most redness manner. JEALOU8Y GIVEN AS CAUSE. Herbert Marx's Brother Blames Taylor for the Shooting. New York, Dec. 6.—Herbert Marx, who shot four men who attacked him in his home, In Westmoreland county, Vir ginia, is on his way home to Brooklyn. The news that Marx had been exoner ated by a coroner's jury gave the young lawyer's friends In this city satisfaction. His sister Bertha said yesterday: "I knew Rose Taylor well. She is the young girl that my brother Herbert was said to have insulted. The thing is im possible. He has known her ever since she was a baby. Her father has been one of our friends and neighbors ever since my father bought the estate in Westmoreland county years ago. My brother is the soul of honor. Rose's cousin, Will Taylor, one of the men who were killed was a hot-headed person, and it was just like him to do such a thing on the strength of gossip, in spite of the fact that he was one of Herbert's friends." William B. Marx, a brother of Her bert, said last night: "After everything has been Investi gated and the whole truth is known it will probably turn out that the attack made on my brother was prompted by jealousy on the part of Taylor." Smallpox Breaks Up Revival. Lowell, Dec. 6.—A most interesting se ries of revival meetings that have been In progress in the Baptist church for some weeks have been suddenly brought to a close by a case of smallpox appear ing some three miles north of town, to which a number of people have been ex posed.

SM&mmm' liteiM Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Makes Favorable Report on Canal Treaty, Money and Bacon Only Ones to Make Objections to Its Provisions. msm®- Clause Providing for Policing the Canal Fails to Meet Their Approval. Washington, Dec. 6.—The senate com mittee on foreign relations today voted to report favorably the new Hay Pauncefote treaty, providing for the construction of the isthmidn cand. The committee was in session about two hours and went over in detail the provisions of the conveti^on. No votes were cast against it, butr^was criti cised very sharply by Money and Bacon, who found in It many of the objections provision of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty They took especial exception to the pro vision continuing in force the neutrality provision fthe Clayton-Bulwer treaty and also made objection to the clause specifically authorizing the United States to police the canal as placing a limitation upon the power of this coun try to absolutely control. Objection was made to the effect that the treaty as sent to the senate would deprive us of control of the canal in case of war. Money and! Bacon did not go to the ex tent of voting against the report cf the treaty and they acknowledge they are anxious to see it ratified because of their great desire to have the canal built. Still, they insisted the treaty as it now stands Is very objectionable in the case of the contingency of war. Lodge was authorized to report a treaty to the senate Monday next. BAD FIRE AT PITT8BURG.

Klee and wife real ized there was only one way to save the children and that was to throw them from the window, a distance of twenty feet. One by one the children were brought to the front window and dropped to the ground by the father. All of them were more or less seriously in jured, but all escaped death from the flames except Mary.

Toledo, O., Dec. 6.—Mayor Samuel M. Jones has resigned from the board of directors of the Toledo Humane Society because its president, James M. Brown, who Is also president of the American Humane Society, declared that man who abandons his children should be put to death. The declaration appears in the annual report of the Toledo Humane Society, and is as follows: "The man who will bring children In to the world and In their helplessness desert them Is unfit to bear the image of either brute or man: ls an enemy to his race, a traitor to his country and should be put to death. Yet, the legis lature of Ohio will send such a man to a stone yard for three months, and the man who steels a cow, from one to sev en years In the penitentiary." Mayor Jones, in his resignation, said he did not believe in killing anybody for crime. 

LIFE SAVED, BUT BOY IS MAD. Chicagoan Loses Reason in the Face of What Appears Sure Death. Chicago, Dec. 6.—Lying on his back in a great Iron boiler, his cries for help unheard because of the roar and din of the big factory, Robert Carter, a boy, saw a big steel drill cut Its way thru the steel above him, and, pointing at his breaBt, come driving on until it caught his jumper. Just in the nick of time the whirling drill was stopped— Just in time to save his life, but not soon enough to save his mind. He was taken to the South Chicago hospital a maniac, and It is*not likely he will re cover his reason. From 7 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock at night he lay in a boiler and held the hot pins In place while the man on the outside riveted them in place. As the driller put the holes thru the steel Carter and the riveter followed him and closed them with red hot pins of steel. Yesterday he lay there holding one of these cherry-colored steel ,spins in his tongs, flat on his beck, when he saw the bright point of the drill cut thru the in­ LAST EDITION# 5 O'CLOCK, MABSHALIiTOWIi-, IOWA, FRIDAY,* DECEMBER 6, 1901 side of the boiler, as he had seen it hun dreds of times before. He watched It as a bird under a charm watches a snake. Nearer and nearer it came, but he made no attempt to move because many times the man at drill was busy elsewhere and let the bit of tempered steel whirl on and on long after it had pierced the boiler cover. It was not until the sharp tool was within a few Inches that he thought of escape. Then it was too late. He was on his back and in the hollow of the lower side of the boiler. He could not turn over without raising his body and this meant the drill, still coming steadily down ward, would pierce him. He gave an agonizing cry for help, but the countless sledges pounding on the boilers In the factory kept up their rhythmic beat and roar, above which no human voice could sound. Finally the twisting bit of steel caught his jumper. A fraction of an inch fur ther and It would have gone Into the flesh, but It was stopped in time, tho no one knew of the peril of the boy until the workmen on the outside, annoyed at the delay, crawled In to investigate. The boy was unconscious when they took him out, but soon revived. When he did he seized a hammer and, climb ing on a boiler, declared he would kill the first person who approached. The police were called, but It took four men to overpower him and take htm to the hospital, for thpse few minutes' expert ence had made htm mad. SHOCKS LATIN QU/fRTER. Couyba Says France Needs More Skilled Artisans and Fewer Poor Artists. Paris, Dec. 6.—Deputy Couyba. chair man of th§_ committee appointed to in vestigate the finances of the famous Ecole des Beaux Arts (School of Fine Arts)' has arrived at a conclusion out raging the feelings of the elder genera tion and dumfounding the rest. M. Couyba declares that the school has become a refuge for young men who do not desire to serve in the army, and that it makes poor artists out of youths who would otherwise have become good arti sans and industrial designers. "Our great factories," says M. Couy ba, are In sad need' of new patterns and designs, while the school Is occupied In attempting to make 'a silk purse out of a sow's ear.' The attendance at the school ought to be limited to 1,000 instead of 3,0Qj), Insists M. Couyba, who further shocks the Latin quarter by recommending that the animal "Prix de Rome" be either abolished or radically changed He also says that since Rome 'is. no longer a great artistic center the win ners of the prize ought to be allowed' to travel in Great Britain, the United States, Belgium and Russia, absorbing the ideals of other nations in order to maintain Parish as the cosmopolitan art capital of the world. Finally, the deputy insists that com petition subjects ought not to be con tinually drawn 'from pagan- and" bit**' Ileal history, but from modern history and literature. The pupils of the school are us yet too much astonished to agree on a com mon plan of resistance to the proposed "reforms," but altho M. Couyba's sug gestions are couched in the most court eous terms, the entire institution is against him in ominous disagreement. SUES COMPANY FOR $50,000. Express Company Employe Asks Dam ages for False Imprisonment. El Paso, Tex., Dec. 6.—Ernest Wade, former employe of Wells, Fargo & Co., yesterday filed suit against the company asking $50,000 for alleged false imprison ment. Wade alleges that while employed by the company at Chihuahua in January, 1001, a package containing $10,000 was stolen and he was thrown into jail and for four days kept in a bare cell with no bed or food. Subesquently, he avers, he was placed ir the public prison and compelled to as sist in sweeping the streets. He says he was In no manner connected with the theft and that no charge was filed against him that finally the Mexican authorities refused to hold him longer without a written complaint and he was released after five months' imprison ment. CUTS OUT OLD HYMN. Methodist Hymnal Revision Committee Eliminates "Sweet Hour of Prayer." Cincinnati, O., Dec. 6.—The Methodist Hymnal Revision committee, which is in session In this city for the purpose of revising the hymn book, has decided to eliminate that old favorite, "Sweet Hour of Prayer," objection to the last line of the hymn having been found. "He Leadeth Me, O, Blessed Thought," is another favorite taken out. John Wesley is a prime favorite and only two of his hymns will be omitted. The old stand-bys, "Jesus Lover of My Soul," ard "Rock of Ages," and others similar will be retained. It takes a two-thirds vote of the nine members of the commission to reject a hymn and put in a new one, and there are warm discussions occasionally, and heretofore there have been decided dif ferences of opinion on the subject. fi'ARE ALIVE AND WELL.

Siranded Iowa Teachers Left on the Island of Guam Reach Philippines. Teachers' Wages in Iowa Very Low—Philippine Service At* tracts by Its Price. Colored Men Are Many Who Want to Be Usher to the Governor. Special to Times-Republican-. Des Moines, Dec. 6.—News has been received here of the arrival in Manila of the party of teachers and others who were left on the Island of Guam by the transport Sheridan by. mistake. In this party was Prof. H. G. Lamson-, who re signed a pastorate at Nevada to go to the Philippines as a teacher and was recommended by Supt. Barrett for the position. In the party of seven left on the island there was three school teachers, an army captain1 and his wife, a^veterinary surgeon for the army and an army chaplain. Prof. Lamson has written that as soon as they discovered their plight of being on a lonely island without money or a change of clothing with the prospect of having to remain a month where there is no hotel they called on the acting governor at- the town which is the seat of government and secured clothing from the army and kind persons lent them some money. Their stay on the Island lasted only two weeks and they spent the time pleasantly, making Investigations and studying the natives. Prof. Lamson and the veterinary surgeon were taken In charge by a brother Mason and they were»given rooms at his place. Among others who arrived on the island of Guam at the same time that the party was left stranded was Prof. H. H. Hiatt, an Iowa State University student, a brother of the superintendent of East Des Moines schools. He is to take charge of the schools In Gua/n as su perintendent and have two teachers un der him. Prof. Lamson has been as signed to duty on one of the islands of the Visyaan group far south of Manila. F. W. Splcer, of Cedar Rapids, was one of the tcachers of the party with Prof. Lamson. One reason assigned for the desire of many Iowa teachers to go to the Philip pines hsiB been stated to be the fact that wages of teachers in Iowa are very low. -A great' many Iowa teachers-have-gone to the Philippines and!'athers-.applled: for positions, but this exodus has de creased since unfavorable reports have been coming back as to the work before teachers who go there. But the fact remains that the teachers of Iowa are not as well paid as in some other states, and In his report just filed the state su perintendent says of this: "Iowa still continues to occupy a low place among the great states of the un ion in the average annual salary paid teachers. According to the report of the national commissioner of education for the year 1899-1900 we paid the lowest average monthly salaries to teachers of the states of the north central division except South Dakota. When we con sider our wealth and our productive soli the showing Is most unsatisfactory. In diana by law enacted this year provided that the salary paid teachers ahali not be less than an hmount determined by multiplying two and one-half cents the general scholarship. The "law has increased the pay of teachers, estab lished a uniform rate of wages and stimulated teachers to improve their scholarship." The snowfall of the past few days h«s done something toward making the an nual precipitation of the year for Iowa something like what It ought to be. But at the present time the deficiency in moisture for the year, for Iowa, amounts to about twelve inches, or to put it differently we have had about one-fourth of the moisture to which we are entitledl on an average year. This means that the year 1901 will be a rec ord breaker as a year of extreme dry ness. The state historical department has just come Into possession of a collection of old Chinese weapons that will at tract a great deal of attention. These are loaned to the department by Kins man post, of this city, to which post they were sent by Minister Conger. The most interesting of the weapons is a big musket, which would be too heavy for any one person to lift and1 aim at an enemy without a rest, it carries a ball weighing an ounce. The gun is seven feet, four inches long and very thick. Minister Conger says that as far as he could ascertain the weapon Is about 100 years old. Two still older guns are small flint-locks, one having tied to It bamboo resting sticks. Two swords, a heads man's knife and' a bamboo pike com plete the collection. The historical de partment is securing curios and rare books and interesting historical matter almost every day and is already a place where hours may be spent with pleasure and profit. There Is trouble among the colored politicians of Des Moines. Quite a num ber of candidate for the place of usher in the office of governor have appeared on the scene. "Billy" Coalson is a can didate for reappointment. He belongs to what might be called the old guard of colored politicians of the city. A number of newer residents of the city have set out to do up the old crowd, and a meeting for that purpqse -was held last night In the office of a colored law yer. A merry war Is on between the fac tions. -V Strango Disappearance. Crawfordsville, Dec. 6.—Our little vil lage is considerably excited over the dis appearance of D. M. Young, a prominent citizen of this place. He moved his fam ily here from Marsh, Iowa, a short time pp-n. hayiUtf nurcbaeed ^owlrlonnn I J,. erty here. Soon after arriving he left the town, telling his wife and five chil dren that he was going to Kansas on realty business. The first heard of him since he left was a few days ago. His wife received a letter from him saying ho was in Edmunton, Canada, quaran tined with the smallpOx. No reason can be given for his being in that part of America. Mr. Young is nearly 40 years of age and at one time was a merchant at Marsh. He was a member In good standing in the M. E. church and has always been considered an upright, law abiding citizen. 

STUDENT'S DARING FEAT. Harvard Man Climbs Sheer Granite Cliff 400 Feet High. New Haven, Conn., Dec. 6.—The feat of W. S^ Merrill, Harvard '04, who ate three steaks, two mutton chops, two dishes of peas, and drank two pints of water and two cups of coffee Wednes day night for a $3 wager, is dwarfed in the estimation of the other students and the residents of this city by the feat of J. A. Whitehead, another Harvard stu dent .who is visiting friends in Yale, in climbing the East Rock, a granite cliff, nearly 400 feet high, front of which stands the soldiers' monument. The rock Is a sheer precipice, and for a hundred feet offers only the slightest hold for foot or hand, but Whitehead climber to the top of it. where he fell al bost exhausted, while the shouts of sev eral hundred students and others who had gathered to watch his perilous as cent rang indistinctly in his ears. Whitehead risked his life, for a mis step at any stage of his upward prog ress after he had gone twenty feet would have meant death. He is still suf fering from the nervous strain. The feat was accomplished at night, as Whitehead did not care to have too large a crowd watching him. He was prompted to try the ascent of the cliff by hearing other students telling of the Impossibility of doing it. Whitehead was with a party that had been at a restaurant where liquid re freshments were Imbibed freely. On the way home, as the party passed the sol diers' monument, olie student remarked: "I'd like to see the man who could climb that rock." "Would you?" said Whitehead. "Well, I'll gratify your desire." He thereupon approached the side of the cliff and began the ascent. Slowly the student climbed. He rest ed at every new foothold. Before he climbed far hi9 fingers were torn and bruised by the rock, but he could not turn back. The men watching WThlte head were almost afraid to move or talk, fearing the sl^htest commotion would cause him to lose his grasp on the naked rock. Gradually the young fellow worked his way up, and In a time, which seemed an age to the watchers, he reached the top and fell exhausted. Whitehead was assisted to his quar ters and a physician dressed the injuries to hi* finger8. He aaid today that several times during the ascent he almost ios# hls' balance, and felt so dizzy that he saw death staring him in the face. 

X-RAY IN AFRICAN CAMPAIGN. Dr. J. H. Edwards Favors Its Adoption by Army Medical Corps. London, Dec. G.—"Military surgery must be rewritten In face of the new facts discovered by means of the X-rays," said Dr. John Hail Edwards, surgeon radiographer of the Imperial yeomanry hospital in South Africa, Dr. Edwards, who was in charge of the Roentgent apparatus during the cam paign, made hundreds of examinations of wounded with many marvelous re sults. He is convinced that the South African war has demonstrated the ne cessity of adding to the army medical corps a propertly constituted X-rays department and of training its members to use the apparatus with readiness in case of emergencies. He said: 'Tlmeworn, useless and dangerous methods for the location of hidden bul lets can be forgotten, the X-ray furn ishing an aseptic, scientific and abso lutely accurate method. The altered conditions of warfare have necessitated considerable alterations in surgical methods. The high velocity of the new firearms leaves fewer bullets in the tis sues, but these few are usually so far from the entrance of the wound that no probe is capable of reaching them, and apart from the X-rays there is no method of finding them. '"It is now possible to examine the whole body in a few minutes, and to find a bullet, no matter where situated, without inconvenience or risk to the patient. Actual experience has taught that altho upon the battlefield the X-ray is superior to the old methods of diag nosis, there is little necessity for the use of the apparatus in such an ad vanced position. The whole of my work in South Africa was done in hospitals. If the work is to be well done it must be done under favorable conditions. Localization requires exactitude. It cannot be properly performed under rought and tumble circumstances." Dr. Edwards added that Mauser and Lee-Metford bullets from a humantar ian point of view are superior to the old Martini-Henry and other bullets. There are far fewer injuries to bones and a remarkable decrease in the num ber of deaths from gun shot wounds compared to former campaigns. This Is due to the new weapons as well as to advanced surgical knowledge. OIL AS FUEL IN TEXAS. It Now Supplants Coal and Wood in Vicinity of Beaumont. Beaumont, Tex., Dec. 6.—Oil as a fuel has supplanted coal and wood in the ter ritory contiguous to Beaumont. When the first strike was made there was dif ficulty in introducing oil as a fuel, but today the market for it is firmly estab lished and the demands are taxing the capacity of local shipping facilities. Up to the present time the shortage of tank cars has been a great hindrance, but the railroad companies are doing everything in their power to remedy the situation. There Is not an oil man In the district who could not send out twice as much oil as he Is flipping If cars were available. The first car went out In March, and since that time 7,000 more have followed. This means more than 1,000,000 barrels, or enough oil to fill a six-inch pipe line 6,510 miles In length. About SO per cent of the oil shipped has gone to Texas and Louisiana markets. xi was thought by some UuU. ike oil I 7 T.-R.

Smith, Night Watchman at Chelsea, Shot Down by Bank Burglars. Bert Compt, a Citizen of the Town, Bound and Thrown Into an Alley. Preparations Made, But Not Com* pleted, to Rob Bank—Three Suspects Arrested. Special to Times-Republican, Chelsea, Dec. 6.—The bank robbers who have been operating in Iowa vis ited Chelsea at an early hour this morn ing, and while they failed to attain the object of their visit, they did worse by murdering the night marshal, J. B. Smith, because he interfered with their plans. There were three men in the party of robbers, and they, made their appearance in town about 2 o'clock a." m. Near the Chelsea bank building they met a young man of the town, and supposing he was the marshal theyv took forcible possesslon' of his percon and bound and gagged him. The robbers were proceeding with their work of gaining an entrance into the bank building when the night marshal came upon them. Just what transpired be tween the burglars and the ofllcer will probably never be known. Smith was^ shot in the head and when found) by citizens who were aroused by the shot^ he was unconscious. It is supposed that Smith attempted to arrest the men, as he was close to them, his face being badly powder burned and the indications being that he was not more than two feet away from the man who (Sid the shooting. The officer lingered until 6 o'clock this morn ing. Parses were at once organized and word was sent to all the neighboring towns. The robbers secured a handcar and started west on the Northwestern. They were traced to Long Point, where they abandoned the car and struck across the country towards Gladstone. They were tracked to this place, bt!rt are supposed to have caught a, passing train' on the Milwaukee. Every effort is being made to effect their capture.. The night operator at the Northweatr era depot was the first to discover the crime and he quickly gtu-e' the alarm. Bert-Compt, the young man who was seised, gagged and bound, was found in an alley by the elevator. He coqld tell nothing about what happened between the marshal and the robbers, altho he heard the shot that ended the life the faithful officer. Compt has a fair .de scription of the men, but is not positive that he could identify them. It has just been learned that three suspects were arrested at Keystone, a station on the Milwaukee line east of this place anX. Gladstone, to which point the murder ers were traced. It is believed they will prove to be the right men. The community is terribly excited over the murder and the anger of the citizens, who are largely Bohemians, is thoroughly aroused. If the murderers are apprehended and their guilt estab lished nothing less than the death pen alty will be accepted. Smith was a good citizen and thoroughly fearless and there is no doubt that he met his deathi while attempting to protect property and in the active discharge of the du ties of his office. That the burglars intended to blow! open the bank there can be no doubt, as they left a complete outfit there and then went in search of the night watch. Smith, the murdered man, was about 24 years old and had been married about a year. Three Killed, Forty Injured. Little Rock, Ark.. Dec. 1 NO I 5 289 fiiisi only
