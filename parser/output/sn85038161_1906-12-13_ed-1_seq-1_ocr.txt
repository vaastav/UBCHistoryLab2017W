VOL. 70--NO. 47 SEVERE CRITICISM or the President's Message but It is Satisfactory to Mass Of People. What Roosevelt Has Accomplished In Fait Six Years-Anotber Salary-Grab BUI to do Introduced. Washington D. O,, Dec. 8, '00. Naturally there Is nothing talked of In Washington bo much Just now as the President's message. It has not been received without criticism. The several Pacific Coast delegations arc strongly against It on account of Its pre-Japancsc utterances, and there arc a good many thlngB In It that do not appeal very much to the Reoubll n lpaili.ru. But to the rank and file of the party it Is satisfactory, and the thing that appeals to the Independent oWrver more than anything else Is the fact that the President does not Bcem to have left -so mucn as an issue In the coming campaign to the op posing party. It Is rather a remarkable thing that the very Issues which six or eight years ago were condemned as rank radicalism, bave ascended in popular favor, first being taken possession of by the Democrats who inherited them from the Populists and then being taken In more sane and acceptable fnrm h the Rcnubllcana, that Is to say by the President, aud leaving the Democrats with very little In the way nt Issues upon which to go before the .nnntrv. One may.look at the fcaturesof the message and the worlc tnat me presi dent has accomplished In the past six years to sec that he has brought what once was called radicalism Into faBhlon. He went after railroad con trol at a time when It waB thought Buch legislation did not have a show In the world, and has forced It to a successful conclusion. Now he has taken up the Income and Inheritance tax proposition, and has carried the country with him. It is still a ques tlon whether he can get Congress and the courts to agree with him but the m.rr. fact that the matter has been i.i,t t nn issue sneaks volumes for the popular enthusiasm with which It has been accepted. w.irthir the President has favored and secured employers, liability legis lation, and he has forced the eight hour law from Its position as a dead letter to one of a living entity. One may have what views he chooses of trades unions and their methods, but the theory of an eight hour day Is sane and just In Itself. It was passed originally by Congress in response to nnnninf clamor in the belief that once passed, there would be nothing more heard of It. But it is on the statute books, and the President 1b .lAntlv determined to enforce It, probably on the theory he followed while police commissioner in New York, that the best way to get a law repealed if it were not a just one was to have ltBtrlctly enforced. Going down the list, one finds that the Pioildent 1b in favor of limiting tWlnlunctlon power of the courts. ' This waa one of Mr. Bryan's pet therleB, He is in -favor of fair treat ment of the colonleB and the passage of the Philippine Tariff bill. He is also for the reform of political methodB, the limiting of campaign contributions and publicity in regard to them. There is Just one Issue that was not touched in the message and that one to which the Democratic party may fasten In the next .campaign It Is the revfslon of the tariff. The posi tion of the President on this subject is well known. He has always been theoretically a free trader, but for u,w nf nnlltlcal and economic conditions, he has been willing to be known as a "fair trader;" Thus he has kept in themlddle of the road and has not yet declared himself on the subject of tariff revision, but there 1b no knowing Just what he may have in reserve as an extra message and one with which he could call together an extra session of the 69th Congress. One of the few things that have been left to the undisturbed consid eration of the Democratic party Is the Issue of government ownership of railroads, and-thls Is so much a per sonal Issue with Mr, Bryan, that It can hardly be called a democratic doctrine, and If adopted would leave the opposition party much In the po sition of a dog being wagged by Its r-,ll The question of Congressmen sal- 9riM r strain coming to me urc, J I. la -ilmnof Cel . - , ..-. n... lll'rh the next tew uaya vuv . a bill introduced raising the salaries from 15,000 a year to 37,500. Such a bill has been prepared by congress man Llttau," and the probability 1b that if It is Introduced it will be pars ed. There has always been some hesitancy on the part of Congress to ralBclta own salary because of the criticism It would be sure to Invoke. Buthe time has come when in all probability the raise cannot be put off much longer. It costs the average GoMratMtaa a gwA deal of real moat?' 1 aadltloa to' Mi rifalSr I ff ., . - v salary to live in Washington. ThU is not a cheap city to live In, and the trouble is that the government em ployee has to live with some re gard to fashion and the Congressman as a rule thinks he has to live a little better than the rank and file of govern ment clerks. But there are excep tions to the rule, and It would sur prise a good many out of town resi dents to know how some of their con gressmen have Hived in thej past. Many of them frequent fairly good boarding houses, thus escaping the expense of house keeping and some of them get a reduced rate from the house as a return for letting it oc known that the establishment Is patronized by Congressman So-and-8o. But there are even more ex treme cases than that. Some of the representatives within the past years at that have been content to live in f ui niahed rooms, very small rooms too and get their meals from the nearest dairy lunch room. There is one re sort of the sort, known to almost every newspaper man in Washlngtpn as "The Broken Shutter," where In past sessions It has been a regular thing to find one Congressman coming in at night with a tin bucket for two cups of coffee and three ham sana- Iches. Both he and his wife lived just across the street In a -furnished apartment house, and It was always a question with the boys who knew the member as to which -df the two got the extra ham sandwich or whether they divided 'it between them. The chances are that the In creased salary bill Is going to be In troduced, and If It is, and Congress 'has the courage of Its convictions, It will pass.

Before us the falls and below the pool In constant motion, steeped In sunshine and shadow, "Where the wild birds bathe and drink And the wild flowers fringe the brink." For minutes we stand In awe; the murmur of the rivulet, the splash of the falls, the voice of the song bird, the crv of his mate, the hum of the Insect, tht whisper of the breeze, the sigh of the heart. Must these, too pass away ? I would not have It so 1 1 would that many arise from the ashes of their sires. I would hear again "the quiet spirit" in the woods, that : "Amid the llent majesty of these deep woods. Its presence may upltft my thougtrts from earth : As to the sunshine and the pure torlghtalr Their tops the green tree lilt. Uere may it hold the mind In perfect mood, Entwining and encircling all Their btrangc and antiquated rhymes With melodies of old tunes, As over some half ruined wall Disjointed and about to fall, Fresh woodbines climb and Interlace And keep the Jtoscncd stones In place."

How lonely the parades of our West I Lost In the Immensity of space, weary of eye aud sick at heart I No, no, not for me 1" I see again a scene of childhood a scene still there In all Its beauty. I stand at the mouth of a deep ravine, on either side, rising a huudred feet or more, wooded with our most majes tic trees with here and there a cedar and a pine well interlaced with hick ory shrubs apd vines of various kinds I Beneath my feet a quiet run above whose surface, here and there, a stone looks forth, whereon I walk dry 8hod. In sending Christmas packages through the mall special attention ..hould be given to the wrapping and addressing and It would be well to have tbe name of the sender also on the package.

Also be sure and eoe that there Is sufficient postage as packages cannot be forwarded If they arc a fraction of au ounce over weight of postage placed on them.

This 1b the first report of the year giving an estimate of the production of corn In bushels. Wheat, condition compared with an average, 03 per cent. Wheat, amount of crop of 1000 sold as soon as threshed, 42 per cent. Wheat, damage to growing crop by Hessian fly, 1.50 per cent. Wheat, damage to growing crop by white grub, 0.10 per cent. Corn, area planted In WOO as re turned by township assessors, 2,802,809 acres. Corn, average yield per acre, 43.5 bushels. Corn, total estimated product for 1900, 125,840,065 bushels. Corn, put Into silo, -3 per cent. Corn, average date cribbing began, October 10. Clover, area sown In 1005 cut for seed, 23 per cent. Clover, average yield per acre, 1.01 bushels. Apples, probable total yield com pared with an average 70 per cent. Tobacco, probable average product per acre 893 pounds. Cattle, number being fed for spring market compared with last year, "8 percent. Sheep, numbor being fed for mutton compared with last year, "7 per cent. The condition of the growing wheat shows an Improvement since the last report, being now estimated at 03 per cent, compared with an average, 'inc past month has been favorable for Its growth, there having been a suffi ciency of moisture with no freezing weather, hence the plant Is now stronirsct and thriving. The late sown wheat Is small, but of a good stand. From present Indications wheat should go Into winter In fine condition. There Is but little com. plaint of damage by Hessian fly, the average for the state being estimated at less than 2 per cent. Tbe corn harvest this year has been most bountiful, and on approximately the same acreage compared with last year the total production this year exceeds that estimated crop by 10, 507,020 bushels The average production per acre is perhaps the greatest In Ohio's history belnc estimated at 43.5 bushels. The area as reported by the township uRBPSBora Is 2.892.809 acres, (riving a total production for the state as a whole of 125,849,005 bushels. In many sections of the state husk ing has been delayed by wet weather, and there Is also some little complaint of damage by mold. The quality of the crop generally, however, Is equal to an average. The total vlcld of apples Is esti mated at 70 per cent, of an average. The number of cattle being fed for the spring market shows about the same per cent, as last year. Live stock generally Is reported to be In fine condition. Pastures have continued late and but little winter feeding has been commenced. McCluro's for 1907. In the January number of McClurc's will begin the Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the history of the Christian Science Movement. For the first time a complete, impartial and true story of Mrs. Eddy and Christian Science 1b to be had It will run throughout the year. Gcorgine Mil mine has written the story for near ly three years she has pursued her study of .the subjects. Five other writers of McClurc's staff have work ed with her to make this story accur ate, fair, unbiased and complete. In view of the fact that for some months the press has been full of diverse and conflicting news and statements re garding Mrs Eddy, It is evident that accurate knowledge concerning her Is difficult to obtain In a short time. Consequently McClure's long and thorough preparation of Its scries will give us for the first time a true his tory and account of her and her cult. Carl Schurz's Reminiscences of a long life will be continued. An indi cation of the timeliness of these reminiscences and the reawakened national Interest In Carl Schurz to which they have contributed, arc the great CarlSchurz Memorial Meetings held recently in the cities, and the Memorial Movement started which proposes to raise 1250,000., and to erect a Carl Schurz Memorial as a tribute to his great service to the progress of our country. William Allen White, Samuel Hop kins Adams, Burton J. Hcndrick and ucorgc Kiuoe Turner will, also con tribute to McClurc's powerful articles on present day topics, conditions and men of national Interest. These writers arc big men and the work of each one aside from Its literary achievement Is a compelling, whole some factor In the regeneration which these United States are now under going. George Kcnnan who won his spurs by his remarkable scries on Siberia and Russia's Exile System has been added to McClurc's staff. The results of his recent Investigations and work will appear at an early date. Ellen Terry contributes an Intimate history of the English drama of our day. This writing teems with anec dotes and Incidents from the lives of great actors whom she knew Intimate ly. From these droll, amuslnir and In- tcrestsng happenings we can under stand why these men and women of genius became loved and famous. For the story readers products of all McClurc's fiction favorites will appear and a large number of writers who have "hit" recently. Such well known names as Joseph Conrad, Mary Stewart Cutting Perceval Gibbon, Viola Roseboro, O. Henry, Myra Kellv, Rex Beach, Mrs. Wilson Wood row and Helen R. Martin give promise oi as gooa stories oi various Borts as any reader could wish. Illustrators of note and merit will also contribute their share and add to the authors productions and enhance the writings and stores by scores of pictures and Illustrations In every Issue.
