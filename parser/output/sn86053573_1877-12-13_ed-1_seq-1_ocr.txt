He said that he felt that all true citizens recognized the truth of tbe motto that worklngmen should cut loo-e from both Democrats aud Republicans. The only hone for the worklngmen was fur them to combine and have the politicians of Imth parties knoel to Uie Vtorklmrman's nartv. Ha believed that they should follow lip this meeting.

He said that It afforded him a great pleasure to speak to laboring men. especially when they were antagonistic tu capital. Organization a a party meant a remedy which lay In their hoids. There was necessarily no antAironliim hetwpvn latmr and ranttal. If united, they were capable of securing Just such wni aa tney reqnireu. laxauon, wnicn kiiuuici ue equal, does not rest equally upon the rich and the poor of the land. They could regulate the tariff and establish a sound currency. The development of InduMry had not kept pace with that of economy. The remedy was that through their (Vmgrcss they should make laws which would make labor and capital work torcther for the good of both. The bond holder had no right to Immunity from taxation. The poor man. being taxed out of tho comfort of Hfo."wa taxed out of existence. He regarded the attempt to re monetize silver simply an attempt to make ninety two cent worth a hundred. He was no friend of tbe Jew, theShylock, who locked his money up In his safe, and said tnat ho wanted his pound of flesh ; but there was necessarily no conflict between honcit labor and honest capital. There was such ft thing as dishonest labor. A DELICATE SUBJECT. In this connection the speaker denounced the action of the men who engaged In the strikes at lltuburgas tramps, and ha was loudly hissed. "Such men were bad men," he continued, and the crowd continued to his. "Vou might Jut a well meet the truth." exclaimed tho sneaker. He hoped that there mo no tramp or no convict among Ma hearers. He would sustain tho laboring man In getting the worth of his money, but not in burning railroad. He was speaking trutk.
