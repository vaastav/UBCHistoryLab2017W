COX, 0D10RNE & CO. MMVAij JbAVOXlVS. The city fathers held a meeting last evening. The train [from Scotland last night was several hours late. Now get out your cutters and sleigh bells and enjoy tho first enow of the season. Snow has been falling most of the day and there is nearly enough for sleighing purposes. Brennan and Russell succeeded in bagging two large wolves during yes terday's deer hunt. Paul Landmann a former Yanktonian, haB sold his Scotland hardware store to a co-operative association of grangers. The president's message crowds out other matter of interest and importance, but Cleveland's utterances will perhaps compensate for the omissions. There will be a meeting of the Yankton ohapter No. 1, R. A. M., this (Tuesday) evening, at 7:30 sharp. Full attendance required. Work in the R. A. degree. The Yankton woolen mill is receiving considerable wool every day. Where manufactured goods are takeq in ex change tor wool the mill pays five cents a ponnd more than tbe market price. Treasurer Blatt announces that a pen alty of five per cent will ibe attaohed to all taxes not paid by the first Monday in January. This is a new arrangment, the oity council having (just passed the ordinance authorizing the penalty, which is to be added to the ten per cent interest forfeited under the old law, There is economy in the prompt pay ment of oity taxes. Charles Watson, who woa indicted by tbe last territorial grand jury for aBsault with a deadly weapon with intent to commit a felony, and upon his first ar raignment pleaded not guilty, was brought into court this morning where he plead guilty. He was sentenced by the court to two yec.ru aud six months in the penitentiary at Sionx Falls, bnt by good behaviour the time will be leE- senetl. The crime was committed some time last summer, at the Germaoia bouse. Watson got into another man's room, and by flourishing a revolver was endeavoring to make the mau give np his wad, bat the clerk at the hotel got on to tha racket and spoiled Wat son's game. The oath of office was administered to Chief nstice Tripp in the clerk's office at the court house this afternoon. There were present beside Mr. Tripp, Judge Edgerton, Geo. H. Hand and clerk of the conrt E. G. Edgerton. After the ceremony Mr. Hand moved the admis sion of A. J. Edgerton as a member of the bar of Dakota, and Judge Edgerton IB now one of Dakota's able lawyers. Probably the last official act of A. J. Edgerton as chief justice of the territory was the sentenoiug of Charles Watson, at the conrt honse this forenoon. All through Judge Edgerton's administra tion as a distributor of justice the many events decided for or against some indi vidual, have been enaoted with the same laok of demonstration that the sen tencing of Watson this morning was sur rounded with.

A fair sized audience greeted the "Little DuoheBs" oombmntion in their first appearance at Turner hall last night, and those who so inconvenienced themselves as to go out on suoh a dis agreeable evening were not disappoint ed. The play itself was a drama by one of the best authors, highly entertainiug from beginning to end, full of the ludi crous of situations. The paits as allot ted were admirably rendered. The "Little Dachese," as portrayed by Matie Williams was particularly well adapted to the aotress* style. Tho role of the villian was well taken by Mr. Molyneaux, the manager of the troupe. Peter and the lawyer brought down the house by their extremely funny sayings and doings, and the balanco of the com-, pauy held their several ends op to par. Altogether the drama was well presented and those who witnessed it truly re ceived their money's worth. To-night the company will present, "All FOOIB D»y," with Matie Williams in the leading role. After the drama the laughable farce, "Dodging for a Wife" will be given. A crowded bouse should greet the company to-night, whatever the weather is. Apples, Apples.

Elegant Ofllecs, Newly refitted in artistic rent in Dudley's block, coruer and Douglae. style, for of Third Feeble Frames, Shaky Nerve* And dyspeptio stomachs are usually found in conjunction. Vitality is lacking in all three, How can this be corrected? gimply by using Hontetter's titomach Bitters with regularity, ab taining from habits inconsonant with healht, and by the use of a digestibly diet. As an initial step toward the reinforcement of a depleted system, a recort to Hostettcr's Stomach Bitters is most desirable, since it cor* rects acidity consequent upon a vitiation of the gastric juices and the presence of bile in the Btomach, and having regulated and, as it were, lubricated the digestive mechanism, sets and it keeps it at work. An immediate gain in vigor is the result. The food is converted into blood, upon which the system draws for nutri tion, the nerves as they acquire vigor become tranquil, the muscular tiber gains substance and hardness, and appetite and sleep improve. Constipation, fever and ague, rheumatism and renal allmcnta yield to the Bitters. City Brewery -AND- Bottling Works -OF- C.F.
