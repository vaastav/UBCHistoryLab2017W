She was noticed and her identity established by her fainting in the street at Cleveland. J. Hal Rei'd, a highly-connected young man, of St. Paul, was convicted of rape. M. L. Howies, of the bark Freeman, was arrested in New York for murder on the high seas. He is charged with having shot and killed a Japanese passenger on his boat n August. ' Andrew Williams, of Laurens, S. C, threw his wife into the fire and tried to burn her to death because she refused to deed him her property. The discovery of petroleum in the vicinity of San Antonio, Tex., has caused great ex citement in that locality. Jerry Manning was shot and killed at Hel ena, Montana, by John McFirnan. Both were gamblers.

A committee representing the anti administration members of the Knights of Labor in Philadelphia has sent out a circular which contains a summary of the abuses that are said to exist in the order owing to the bad management of Powderly and his frierids. A rebellious Knight of this city says that the organization is certainly going to pieces, and that its strength will be used to build up a trade3-union and political labor movement. Peter Bennett, a wealthy farmer of New port, Maine, was shot and severely beaten by burglars, who robbed him of 32,000 in bills and gold. A case of extreme cruelty on the part of a f rm of wealthy ship-owners has just come to light in Canada. Shortly after the departure of the ship Hebe from Rio de Janeiro, last August, smal'-pox broke out among the crew, and the captain ran the boat ashore on a desolate island belonging to the Magdalen group. Word was sent to the owners by a government steamer, but they have paid no attention to the appeals o f the unfortunate men, on the ground that they had no right to run the vessel ashore. By the explosion of a locomotive at Stel larton Station, Nova Scotia, Monday, three men were killed. Now that M. Sadi Carnot has been elected president of France, a subscription has been started for the purpose of erecting a monu ment to his grandfather. It is rumored that M. Goblet will be prime minister in the new cabinet, and that M. Flourens will remain minister of foreign affairs. "Bill" Gallagher appeared as a witness for the defendant m the case of August Mette & Co. against the Illinois Mutual Insurance company, which came up for a hearing in a Chicago court Tuesday. His residence at Joliet has so changed his appearance that his most intimate friends would hardly recognize him. The trial was begun in New York Tuesday of two suits brought by the Banque Franco Egyptienne. of Paris, and Henry L. Bis choffschein, of London, against John Crosby .brown ana others for about $0,000,000 President Monahan, of the Switchmen's National union, arrived in Milwaukee Tues day, to take part in the fight of the local' switchmen against the railroad companies. Their demand is for an increase of pay to the Chicago standard. The impression pre vails that it will not be granted. A Cincinnati paper publishes a number of letters which, it is asserted, were written by Harper, the Fidelity bank wrecker, to Miss Josie Holmes, his former exchange clerk. They are of a decidedly amatory nature, and were given up for publication by Charles Hopkins, son of the assistant cashier of the bank, who secured possession of them while acting as a messenger between Harper and the young woman, and who kept them be cause he saw that Harper was trying to shoulder the responsibility for the bank's failure upon his father. At the trial, Thurs day, the testimony for the government was concluded. The defense will open Friday, and it is thought that Harper will be the only witness called.

At the meeting of the wool-growers and wooldealers in Washington, Thursday, a vigorous protest was made against that por tion of the president's message which recom mends a reduction in the customs duties on wool. It is the general impression at Washington that there is not the slightest possibility that the nomination of Mr. Lamar as justice of the supreme court will be rejected, though it is expected that a number of republican sen ators will vote against him. The jury in the Rainsbargor murder case at Marshalltown, Iowa, are unable to agree, and the judge proposes to keep them out un til Sunday if they do not come to an under standing before that time. Mrs. Fellowes, an insane woman living at Toronto, Canada, killed her baby, Thursday, by cutting off its head. The report of the committee appointed to investigate the charges against ex-Warden Reed, of the Stillwater, Minnesota, peniten tiary, wholly exonerates him. August Leister, , of Bucks county, Penn sylvania, who "was sentenced recently to a long term in the penitentiary for shooting his wife, committed suicide in his cell Thursday night by hanging himself with a towel. At a meeting of Catholics in Vienna a strong feeling was manifested in favor of the restoration of the papacy to temporal power. It is not probable that such demon strations will have any effect upon the Ital ian government, which has shown itself quite capable of managing , its own affairs without assistance of any suggestions from abroad. At a banquet in St. Petersburg, Thursday night, the czar offered a toast to the health of the Emperor William, and the band play ed the Prussian national anthem. It has not been stated as yet, however, that the Russian troops have - been withdrawn from the Austrian frontier. The surviving inhabitants of the town of Bavispe, Mexico; which, was destroyed by an earthquake recently, are in a destitute con dition notwithstanding the measures taken by the state ior their relief. The Toledo Ohio company, which has been running in opposition to the Standard, has sold out to the latter for $100,000. Whipped His Child to Death. Newaygo, Mich., December 9. Oregon Hamilton, of Woodville, is under arrest here for the murder of his infant child. The child was brutally beaten, and, literally whipped to death. Its body presented a a sickening sight. It was black from its arms to its knees. Hamilton manifests no sorrow in the least, but since his imprison: ment has been trying to throw the respond, bility of the child's death upon a woman who had charge of the child, its mother being dead. A warrant has been issued for her arrest. A Bill to Perpetuate the National Banks Washington, D. C, "December 7. The bill to perpetuate the national banking sys tem, which will be introduced by Senator Farwell, as soon as the committees are formed, provides that a national bank may be organized by depositing with the treas urer of the United States in lien of the United States registered lands (as now re quired) any state or municipal bonds, or any first mortgage railroad bonds, whose cash value is equal to a greater amount than their par value and whose interest doesnot fall below four per cent. Several conditions inodif this regulation. The treasurer shall not receive the state or municipal bonds at more . than 75 per cent, of their par value nor the first mortgage railroad bonds at more than 50 per cent of their par value. He6hall not receive any railroad bonds exceeding in total more than $500,000,000. The approval of the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller of the currency is necessary, ana circulation may be issued on these bonds, only in the pro portion in which they are received. One section provides that whenever the comp troller has ascertained that any bank has re fused to pay its circulating notes he may .in stead of cancelling its bonds, cause so much of them as may be necessary to redeem its outstanding note3 to be sold at auction in New York, orhc may proceed in the United States court to collect such bonds as fast as they shall mature. For any deficiency in the proceeds of all bonds of an association, when thus sold or collec ted, to reimburse the United States for the amount expended in paying the circulating notes of the association. The United States shall have a paramount lien upon all its as sets, and such deficiency shall be made out of such assets in preference to any and all other claims whatsoever, except the neces sary costs and expenses of administering the same. Many rumors were current this afternoon relative to the distribution of the chairman ships. Little credence is generally given to them, however, owing to the fact that many changes in the list are inevitable, even after it shall have been advanced much nearer to completion than it is presumed to be at present. The appointment of a committee on rules. which will probably be made in a day or two, is awaited with special interest, for the reason that the chairman of the committee on ways and means has always been a member of the committee on rules, and the arrangement of Mr. Mor rison's successor on the lasv named commit tee will be generally regarded as tantamount tothe selection of the chairman of the com mittee on ways and rdfans. ii Report of the Chief of the Secret Service Division. Washington, D. C, December 7. The annual report of the chief of the secret ser vice division of the treasary wos made pub lic to-day. It shows tnat thsra were 355 persons arrested by the ofhcbrs of the ser vice during the past fiscal 3rear for violation of the laws against counterfeiting, etc. Of this number seventy were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. The report says that the counterfeiting'now being done is principally the work of Italians, who operate in bands in different portions of the eonntry. The counterfeiting done during the past year amounts practically to nothing, the only at tempt m that direction being a $10 silver certificate and a $2 silver certificate, and these were such poor imitations as to be practically harmless. The report refers to the fact that all but two of the many skilled operators arrested since the war for counter feiting United States bonds, are now at liber ty, and says they may be expected to resume their nefarious operations at any time. The report attributes the scarcity of coun terfeit money to excellence of the work done at the bureau of engraving and print ing, and to the almost certainty of punish ment 6f the offendexs. Russia is Suspicious. Pabis, December 7. According to private advices from Warsaw the massing of Russian troops on the frontier is attributa ble to information received by Russia of a concerted plan by Germany and Austria for united action in the event of war between either of these powers and Russia. In that contingency it was proposed that Germany and Austria should suddenly invade Russia nextto Poland and occupy Warsaw by using their greater facilities for mobilizing. In consequence of the discovery of this alleged project, Russia resolved to compensate for her slow power of mobilizing by permanent increase of her frontier forces. The move implies no aggression, but is a purely de fensive precaution. Released on Rail. New York, December 8, An application was made before Judge Lawrence to-dhy in the supreme court for admission to bail of Johann Most, in who"o case an appeal has been taken from the judgment of the court of general sessions.

CONGRESSIONAL. Washington, D. C, December 7. After the presentation of various communications from the heads of departments and court of claims Mr. Cullom remarked that the rule was that wheD bills are introduced before the committees are appointed to have such bills laid on the table and that created unneces sary work. He therefore moved that the senate adjourn, but he withdrew the motion lencporanly to permit Mr. Plumb to offer a resolution calling on the commissioners of agriculture for information as to whether' any person in the employment of that de partment, making experiments as to the manufacture of sugar from sorghum had obtained or applied for a patent for patents connected with such manufacture, and grow ing out of such experiments.

The momemtum acquired by twenty-five years of prevalence of republican principles has not yet lost its force, and the material inter est of the country are still prosperous, as result of republican industrial legislation. Recent utterances, however, indicate the determination to end this prosperity by ad verse legislation forced upon the country by an administration hostile to American in dustry; and also indicate the necessity of a return to yower of the republican party in national government so that American in dustry, wool growing, sugar raising, equally with iron making, and that production may have continued prosperity, and employes in these industries have constant employment and continued good wages, such as Ameri can workmen should receive." The roll was then called and every state and territory with one or two exceptions was represented by a delegate or proxy. The committee then proceeded to vote formally by ballot each state or territory representative stepping up to the chair man's table as the state or territory was called, and depositing his vote in a hat.

The president said: "I am glad to meet so large a delegation of the Evangelical Alli ance of the United States. I understand the purpose of this Alliance to be the applica tion of christian rules of conduct to problems and exigencies of social and political officers. Such a movement cannot fail to -produce most valuable results. All must admit that the reception of teachings of Christianity results in the purest patriotc ism and a most scrupulous fidelity of publi trust, and in the best type of citizenship, those who manage the affairs of the govern ment are by this means reminded that the law of God demands tEat they should be courageously .true to the interests of the people, and that the ruler of the universe will require of them a strict account of theii stewardship. The people, too, are thua taught that their happiness and t welfare will be best 'prompted by a continuous regard for the interest of common brotherhood, and that the success of government by the people depends upon the moral ity, justice and honesty of the people. I am especially pleased to know that your efforts are not cramped and limited by denomina tional lines, and that your credentials are founded on broad christian fellowship, es pecially if you seek to teach your country men toleration, you, yourselves, must be tolerant- If you would teach them to be liberal for the opinions of each other, you, yourselves, must be liberal; and if you would teach them unselfish patriotism, you, yourselves, must be unselfish and patriotic. There is enough of work in the field you have entered to enlist the heartfelt co-operation of all who believe in and value the efficacy of christian teaching and prac tice. Your noble mission, if undertaken in a broad and generous spirit, will surely ar rest attention and respectful consideration of your fellow citizens, and your endeavors consecrated by benevolence and patriotic love, must exert a poweful influence in the enlightment and improvement of our peo ple, in illustrating and in advancing the frosp&rity and greatness of our beloved and. Rev. Dr. Burchard, of New York, of three "R's" fame, was among those pre sented. The president recognized him at once, and advancing toward him, said, with considerable earnestness and fervor, that he was very glad to see him, whereupon the crowd of delegates broke out in a laughter.
