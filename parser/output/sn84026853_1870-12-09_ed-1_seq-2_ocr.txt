WVU,IV, ?? *? vnv I gratifying success of which Has been! snch as to stimulate all kindred enter-1 prises elsewhere. The speaker gave an interesting reviey of tbo objects! I of the Society, acu the history of its * past operations. It was intended to j "supplement not to supplant colored labor. Skilled efficient labor was the crying necessity of the South, to the importation of which every effort ""i ' ehfcald now be directed. The succors of the dewberry Society was oncoura^ing. It had encountered obstacles, ?jind suffered losses; but of the five ;b and red immigrants that it had introduced, over sixty per cent, had remained?a potent eloment of material development, and industrial progress." ,3l0 aitf in this progress?not to make ?onoy for the members?was tbo design of this Socicty. The cost of th"e laborer* was some SlG, (to be refunded Jiy tho laborer,) besides a small fee of . Mto tho Society, to cover incidental ' Menses. The hiro of tho laborer, irhcn money wages were paid, was ; jsi'o per month," to bo increased h ,to 813, besides board at $(} per month. AU of ihis was expensive, and the ox- , ponse could not be defrayed under the old system. But tho labor.was intel- \ tolligent and effective, and would in , tlio end be most profitable. We shall j 'not pretend to give even a synopsis | ? f A .] .mUiaIi ii*na . (JU bS\V XlUUl'UM ? uivu *> uo ill-411 Jf in- | .tercs.ting and instructive.

President's Message. : The following is a 8}*nopsis of the ' Message which was rea*J before the Houses of Congress on Monday last: "After congratulating tho country on peace prospects, the President related that the freo exercise of the , elective franchise had been denied to , citizens in several places, lately in -re- . hellion, ami the verdict of the people thereby reversed. .Referring to the European war, he spcahs of tho satisfactory manner in which the protection of the American Minister at Paris was extended to German subjects in France. .Referring to the proclamation of the Republic of France, he says that, should the present struggle result in attaching tho heart of the French to} tlio simpler forms of a Republican * Government, it will be a subject of still further satisfaction, Tho Ameri#tn people should not bo indifferent to tho spread of American political ideas in a great and highly civilized < r-onntry like France; that if an op- \ portunjty ft;r interposing tho good > offices of the United Slates in restor- ^ ing peace shall present itself, that action will bo heartily take. As to C-uba, hr says tho condition of the nsurroction has not matarially chang-. ' ?d. He renews his recommendation i :o annex San Domingo, and Bays bo ] soon as it is known that the pVoject s abandoned by tho UnijLed States, legotiations will be opened b}r some )f the European powers, for tho pos;oRsession of the Samana. IIo urges ;nrly action of Congress, and suggests that by joint resolution of tho wo houses,-the Executive shall be inthorized to appoint a commission to icgotiate a treaty with the autbori icB of San Domingo, for tlio acquisi- J ion of that island, and that an appropriation bo made to defray the extenses of a commission. The quesion might then bo determined better \y the action of tho Senato in the treaty, or by the action ?f both Houses on a resolution of innovation, as in the caso of Texas, le calls the attention of Congress to ho continuance and extension of the ^e\v Mexican FrnoZono, and to the ?ien-tsin massacre. In regard to the Uabama claims, ho recommends that Congress authorize the appointment j if a commission to take nroofs as to * 1 hcse claims, and that authority be ;iven for their settlement by the J1 Jnited States, so that the Crovorn- ] nent shall have the ownership of the t rivato^'laiins aa well'as the respon- si ible control of all the demands a gainst Great Britain. Irr regard to p lie Canadian fisheries, ho complains J hat the course*of* the Canadian au- tl lioritics has uot been marked 03* p iendly feelings, and intimates tli-at ' they should attempt to enforce a 0 crtain act of the Dominion Parlia- Ii lent, it will bo his duly to take such ft teps as may be necessary to projet the interests of theUnitod States itizcms. Jle asks that power bo c-on-J 'ired upon him to suspend the ope-j \ti?n oi the laws authorizing the M ansit of merchandize in bond \\ trough the United States to Canada, \j nd also to suspend the operation of'.w ny laws whereby vessels of the Do- c? linion aro permitted to' enter tho w alors of tho United States. lie m Iso eoniplaiiis of the pretensions of anada to the control of tho navigaon of the St. Lawrence, and armies 10 importance and right of the UnitJ States to navigate that river, withU let or hindrance. With regard to ic depressed condition of the foreign ^ Hnmerce of the United States, he so recommends a liberal policy toards tho Pacific mail hc.tween Cali rnia and Japan. IIo also reeomisnds.that measures may bo taken' ) permit American merchants to ft urclnwo vessels-built abroad, as well ^ ) to pnrchaso American ship-build g. With regard to the currency, ie President, says the approach to a iccie basis is very gratifying, but the stability of the currency is very ('judicial to prosperity. lie thinks I lotimo has arrived when, by a wise j">d prudent legislation, Congress lould look to a policy which would 1 e ace the currency at par with gold 10 no distant day. With regard to , venue reform, ho says if it means ai keen the revenue down to what is :cessary for tlio support, of the Gov- = nmentand payment of interest ori 0 public debt, it has his hearty suprt; but if it means failure.to proJo the necessary means to defray 1 expenses of the Government, he. * opposed to it. Revenue reform, he ^ ys, has not been defined by its adeate6; it seemed, however, to be copied as something which was to pply every man's wants, without y effort pp his part. [Laughter.] Q j recommends tho abolition of the inking privilege, and reform in the il service, particularly as to the A >de of appointing snbordinato offi- ?7 lis. an : an( The Ninth Census.?Though the j?e suits of the census of 1870 are not ly collected, enough has been as taincd to establish that the popuion of the United gtates is about 000,000. The New York Post estiites that the principal change in c},, 3 proportionate political power of ] ? country will be tho transfer of ta arly one-third of that now held by iw England to tho States bordering tho Mississippi valley. Tho Sou- on Jrn States are saved from tho loss political power by the act of emanation. J x?v' i*';'? ? r?P.rtV"^ .i" Sounding tiie Alarm.? Daddy 3ain, ir? ,tho last number qf the Misttwary ftecord, assures the faithful ,hat sincc the elections a grea? change ias come over Governor Scott, who,: ;iaving accomplished the desire of bin \n heart, will make tho negroes keep their places, and turn South Carolina, p into a white man's State, by removing g*1 the colored officials and filling the va- a nancies with white men. The idea is that Governor Scott can secure, through the present Legislature, the By completion of tho Blue Ridge Rail- t roa<l, and will, upon his retiring from the Gubernatorial chair, become President of what may then bo' the most A J important railroad in the South. Dad1\* Cain declarpu 1 linrpfovn tliif il,f? negroes do not intend to be sold out, and that tho leading colored men must counsel together and frame and act upon an independent policy, with which no white man will bo allowed* " Lo interfere. wi TjUi? is about tho sum and Substance sflJvtWy Cain's last pronunciamenLo ;'but. coming as it docs from a1foiled office-seeker of ceccnlric mor[llily, it will be taken by both whites K and blacks with 6C%*eral grains of Avl! *alt- ins FIE
