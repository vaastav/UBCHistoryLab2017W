OFFICERS: DECEMBER 11, 1909. President Favors Statehood. President Taft's statement iu hia message conceraiog Statehood. 'The successful patty in the last election in its national plat tor ai de cUrfd in favor of the admission to separate Statehood of New Mexico cd Arizona and I recommend that legislation appropriate to this end be adopted. I urge, however, that care e exercised in the preparation of the legislation affecting each Territory to secure deliberation in the selection of persons as members of the. convention to draft a constitution for the incom ing State and I earnestly advise that such legislation after adoption by the convention shall be submitted to the people of the Territory for their ap proval at an elestion in which the sole isanw shall be the merits of the propos ed constitution and if the constitution is defeated by popular vote means sbtll be provided in the enabling act for a new convention and the drafting of a new constitution. I think it vi tal that the issue as to the merits of the constitution should not be mixed up with the election of State officers attd that no election of State officers should be had until after the constitu- tiou has been fully approved and settled upon." . . 'A Great Opener." One of the beat written articles in "W est Uoast of Mexico Section of the Lios Angeles Times of November 28tb, is that under the caption "A Great Opener," troa the able pen of Colonel Eprs Randolph, president of the great Southern Pacific ailtoid Company of Mexico, now in course of construction toward the City of Gudalajira, about - one, thousand miles from Nog-ales. From the main line there are numer ous branches being built, .one of the most important, according to Col. Ran dolpb, being that which diverges at the crossing of the Ynq ii River, sixty nine miles southeast of Guymas, and following the aqui, Bavispe and San Bernardino rivers to the international boundary line at Douglas, Arizona, The length of this branch will be about three hundred and ninety miles. It penetrates the region which Baron Hutiibolt characterized as "the min eral storehouse of the world," "Another important branch is that from this city to Oaoanea, completed and in operation. "The main line of the railroad en ters the state of Sonora at N 02a lea and runs thence directly south to the port of Guaymas on the Gulf of Cali fornia, thence southeasterly, skirt ing the coast line through the en'ire states of Sonora, Sinaloi, the territory of Tepic, and through the state of Ja lisco, as far as the city of GudaUjara, where a connection will be made with the National-Rail way of Mexico with the City of Mexico."
