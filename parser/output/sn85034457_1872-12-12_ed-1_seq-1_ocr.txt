EATON, OHIO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1872. WHOLE NUMBER 294. JJ S THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Senate and. Souse of HmrrMyitalivr- la transmitting to vou bit fourth annual : message it is with thankfulness to the Giver ot an good, that as a nation we have been blessed for the last rear with peace at home ana aoroaa, ana a general prosperity vouch . .... sa fed to but few people. With the exception H the recent devastating fire which swept from the earth at a breath, as it were, mil lions of accumulated wealth in the city of .Boston, there has been no overshadowing saiansiiies witnin tne Tear to record. It is gratifying to nste how like their fellow-citi aens of Chicago, nnder similar circum stances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying nnder their misfortunes, and the prospect is that tbelr energy and persever- brca will overcome all obstacles and show the saaoe prosperity soon that they would - have had, had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise, we have been free from pestilence, war and the calamities which often overtake nations. And, as for as human judgment can ponetr&te tne future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. When Congress adjourned in June last, a question had been raised by Great Britain, and was then pending, which for a time se riously imperilled the settlement, by friendly arbitration, of the differences existing be tween this Government and that of her Britannic Majesty, which, by the Treaty of nasmneton, naa oeen reierrea to the tri bunal of arbitration which had met at Gen - eva, in Switzerland. The arbitrators, how ever, disposed of the question which had jeopardized the whole of the treaty aad threatened to involve the two nations in most unhappy relations toward each other, in a manner entirely satisfactory to this Government, and in accordance with the views and the policy which it had main tained. The tribunal which had convened in Geneva, in December, concluded its la- borioua session on the 14th day of Septem ber last, on which day, having availed itself of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sum in gross, it made its decision whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 in gold, as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States lor the satisfaction of all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision, happily, - disposes of & leng standing difference bs- tweea the two Governments, and in connec tion with another award made by the German Emperor under a reference to him by the aame treaty, leaves the two Governments without a shadow upon the friendly relations, which it is my sincere hope may forever re main equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United States, appointed to attend the Geneva tri bunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the arbitrators, the argu ments of the counsel of both governments, . the award of the tribunal, and the opinions given by the several arbitrators is transmit ted herewith. I have caused to be commnni cated to the heads of the three friendly powers who cam plied to the joint request made to them nnder . the treaty the thanks of this Goverment for appoint mint of arbitrators made by them respectively, and also my thanks to the emi nent personages named by them, and my appreciation of the dignity, patience, impar- . tiality and great ability with which they discharged their arduous and high functions. Her Majesty's Government has communi cated to me the appreciation by hor Majes ty of the ability aod indefatigable industry displayed by Mr. Adam?, the arbitrator . named on the part of this Government, dur ing the protracted inquiries and discussions of the tribunal. I cordially unite with her Msjesty in this appreciation. It is due to the agent of the United States before the tribunal, to record my appreci ation of the marked ability, unwearied pa tience, and the prudence and discretion with which he has conducted the very responsible and delicate duties committed to him. And it is also due to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this Government, to express my sense of the talent and wisdom which they brought to bear in the argument of the result so happily reached. It will be the province of Congress to provile for the distribution, among thoe who are entitled to it, of their respective shares of the money to be paid. Although the turn awarded is not payable until the year1 from the -date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper examination of the sev- - eral cases in which indemnification may be du. I consequently recommend the crea tion of a- Board of Commissioners for the purpose. By the Thirty-fourth article of the . Treaty of Washington the respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain in - their construction of tho treaty of the 15th June, 1846, defining the boundary line be tween their respective territories, were sub mitted to the arbitratiou and award of his Majesty the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of these claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the treaty of 1846. His Majesty the Emperor of Germany having been pleased to undertake the arbi- . tration has the earnest thanks of this Gov ernment and of the people of the United States for the labor, pains antf care which he has devoted to the consideration of this long-pending difference. I have caused an expression of my thanks to be communicated to his Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this Government at Berlin, conducted the case and prepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability that his past service just fied the public in expecting at his hands. As members of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty which has given lite to this discusiion between the two Gov ernments; as the Minister to Great Britain ' when the cans truction now pronounced un founded was first advanced, and as the agent and representative of the Gove ament to present the case and to receive the award, he has been associated with the question in . all of its phases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal rnd earnestness in maintenance of the claim of - the United States. He is entitled to much credit for the success which has attended the - - submission. After a patient investigation of the case, and of the statements of each party, ' his Majesty the Emperor of Germany, on the 21st day of October last, signed his award in writing, decreeing that the claim of the Government of the United States that the boundary line batween the territories of her Britannic Majesty and the United States should be rawn through the Haro channel, . is most in accordance with the true inter- . pretation of the treaty concluded on the 15th of June, 1848, between the sgents of her Britannic Majesty and of theUnited States. . Copies of the case presented on behalf of each Government and of the statement in - - reply to ea ;h, and a translation'of the award, are transmitted herewith. This award con fi ms the United States in their claim to the important Archipelago Islands lying be tween the continent and Vancouver's Island, which for. twenty.-aix yesrj ever, since the ratification cf the treaty Great Britain has contested, and leaves us for the the first time in the history of the United States as a nation without a question of disputed boundary be tween our territory and the possessions of Great Britain on this continent. It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt, spontaneous action of her Majesty's Government in giving effect to the award. In anticipation of any request from this Government, and before the reception in the United States of tbe award signed by the Emperor, her Majesty had given instructions for the removal of her troops, which had leen stationed there, and for the cessation of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction so as to leave the United States in exclusive posses -- tion of the lately disputed territory. I am grateful to be able to announce that the or ders for the removal of the troops have been executed, and the military joint occupation ot Ban Juan has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of the United States.. -It now becomes necessary to com plete the survey and determination of that portion of the boundary line through the Haro channel, upon which the uommission which determined the remaining part of the lino were unable to agree. I recommend the appointment of a Com mission to act jointly with one which may be named by her Majesty tor that purpose. Experience of the difficulties attending the determination of our admitted line of boun dary, after the occupation of the territory and its settlement by by those owing allegi ance to tie respective Governments, points to the importance of establishing, by natural objects or other monuments, the actual line between the territory a quired by purchase from Eneeia, and the adjoining possessions of her JUntanme Majesty. The region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting in terests of individuals, or of jurisdiction, are' likely to interfere to the delay or embarrass ment of the actnal location of the line. If deferred until population shall enter and occupy the territory, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the two Govern ments in antagonism. I therefore recom mend the appointment of a Commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part ef ureal Britain, to determine the line between our territory of Alaska and the coterminous possessions of Great Britain. In my last annual message I recommended the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the ar ticles of the treaty of Washington of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries and toother matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on tbe part of Great Britain and the possessions. That leeislation on the part of Great Britain and its possessions had not then been had, and during the session of Congress a ques tion was raised, which for the time raised a doubt whether any action by Congress in the direction indicated wuld become mu portant a question which has since been disposed of, and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of Ihe Provincial Government have passed laws to carry the provisions or the treaty on the matters referred to into operation, 1 therefore recommend your early adoption-of the leeislation in the same direction neces sary on the part of this Government. The Joist UommiEBion ior determining tne boundary line between the United Stat's and the British possessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the Kocky Moun tains, has organized and entered upon its work. It is desirable that the force be in creased, in order that the completion of the survey and the determination of the bound ary line may be sooner attended to. To this end I recommend that a sufficient appropria tion be made. With France, our earliest ally : Russia, the constant and steady friend of the United States; Germany, with whose Government and people we have so many causes of friendship, and so many common sympath'es, nrf thA other powers ot Europe, our rela tions are maintained on he most friendly terms. Since my last annual message the exchange has been made of the ratification of a treaty with the Austro-Hungary Em pire, relating to naturalization ; also cf a treaty with the German Empire, respecting Consuls and trade-marks ; also of a treaty with Sweden and Norway, relating to nat ural :zation ; all of which treaties have been dnly proclaimed. Congress, at its last session, having made an appropriation to defray the expenses ot commissioners on the part of the United States to the International and Statistical nTirrMM at St. Petersburg the persons ap pointed in that character proceeded to their destination and attended the sessions of the Cosgress. Reports shall in due season be laid beiore you. This Congress meets at in tervals of about three years and has held its sessions in several of the countries of Europe. I submit to vour consideration the propriety of extending an invitation to the Congress to - . . . . 1 TT " i 1 .11. L hold its next meeting in tne udiuju Tbe centennial celebration, to be held in 1876, would afford an appropriate occasion for such a meeting. Preparations are making for the Interna tional Exposition, to be held during the next year in Vienna, on a scale of very triut mairnitnde. The tendency of these expositions is in the direction of advanced civilization and the elevation of industry, of labor, aad the increase of human happiness, as well as of greater intercourse ana gooa will between nations. As this exposition is to be the first which will have been held in Eastern Europe, it is believed that American inventors and manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves of the opportunity lor the presentation of their productions, if en couraged by proper aid and protection. At the last session of CongreES authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent tnis vioverument at me Exposition. The authority thus given has been exercised, but in the absence of any nnnrnnriation there is danger that the im portant benefits which the Exposition offers irill, in a large degree, oe lost to ciuzans ci the United States. I commend the subject strongly to your consideration, and recom mend that an adequate appropriation be made for the purpose. To further ai.l tne American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposi tion, I would recommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Srcrat&ry of the Navy be authorized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our At lantic cities and Trieste, or the meat conve nient port to Vienna, and back, their articles for exhibition. Rinee vonr last session, the President of the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his high character' and by his services to his country, has died. His temporary successor has now been elected with great unanimity by the people a proot cf cOJUdence ou their part in this patriotism and wisdom which, it is believed, will -be confirmed by the results of his administration. Tt. ia narticularlv desirable that nothing should be left undone by the Government cf either Republic to strongmen, moir as neighbrs and friends. It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb .ine quiev ui bcmsiuuu border between our territory and that of Mexico, and that c:mplaints of wrong to American citizens in para oi mo cuuuurjr are made. The revolutionary condition in which the neighboring Republic has so long been involved has, in some degree, con tributed to this disturbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled rule ct order through the Republic, which may be ex pected from the present Government, the acts of which just complaint is made will ceace. The proceedings of the Commission under the cenvention with Mex:co of the 4th of Julv. 1868. on the subieet of claims, have un fortunately been checked by an obstacle, for the removal ot wnicn measures nave ueeu taken by the two Governments which, it is believed, will prove successful. Tbe Com missioners appsinted pursuant to the joint resolutions of Congress of t!.e 7th of May last, to inquire into the depredations on the Texas frontier, have diligently made investi gations in that quarter. Their report upon the subject will be communicated to you. Their researches were i eeessarily incomplete, partly on account of the limited appropria tion made by Congress. Mexico, on the part of that Government, has appointed a similar commission to investigate these outrages. It is not announced officially, but the press of that country states that the fullest investiga tion is desired, and that the co operation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. 1 tn reiore recommena mat a special appropriation be made, at the earliest day practicable, to enable the Commissioners on the part of the United States to return their labors without delay. It is with regret that 1 have again to an nounce a continuance of the disturbed condi tion of the island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacification of the discontented portion of the population has been made, while the insurrection has gamed no advan tages, and exhibits no more of the elements ofpowerorof the prospect of ultimate suc cess than were exhibited ayearago. Spain, on the oth?r hand, has not succeeded in re pression, and the parties stand apparently in the same relative attitnde which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four years. Were it seen at a distance from our neighborhood we might be indifferent to its result, although humanity could not be un moved by many of its incidents whenever they might occur. It is, however, at our door. I cannot doubt that the continued maintenance of slavery in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the continuance of this strife. A terrible wrong is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of other reforms in the Administration ot the government in Cuba could not faii to advance tbe restoration of peace and order. It is especially to be hoped that the present liberal Orovernment of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view. The law of emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, has remained un executed in the absence of regulations for its eniorccement. It was but a leeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recogni tion of right, and was hailed as such and exhibited Spain-in harmony with sentiments of humanity and of justice, and in sympathy with the other Powers of the Christian and civilized world. Within the past few weeks tho regulations for carrying out the laws of emancipation have been announced, giving evidence of the sincerity of the intention of present Government to carry into effect the law of 1370. I have not failed to urge the consideration of the wisdom, the policy, and the justice of a more effective system for the abolition of the great evil which has oppress ed a race and continues a bloody and destructive contest close to our border, as well as the expediency and the justice oi conceding reforms of which the propriety is not questioned. Deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the con tinuance of the unhappy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of the United States, or those claiming to be such, are large holders in Cuba of what is there .claimed as property, but which is forbidden and de nounced by the laws of the United States. They are thus in defiance o the spirit of our own laws, contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. In my last annual tnessage I referred to this subject, and I again recommend such legis la ion as may be proper to denounce and, if not prevent, at least to discourage American citizens from holding or dealing in slaves. It is gratifying to announce that the rati fication of the convention concluded under the auspices of this Government, between Spiia on the one part and the allied Repub lics of the Pacific on the other, providing for an armistice, have been exchanged. A copy cf the instrument is horewith sub mittea. it is nopea mat luis may oe i Al lowed by a permanent peace between .the same parties. The differences which at one time threat ened the maintenance of peace between Brazil and the Argentine Republic, it is hoped, are in the way of satisfactory adjust ment. With these States, as with the Re publics of Central and South America, we continue to maintain the most friendly rela tion. It is with regret, however, I announce that the Governor of Venezuela has made no farther payments on account of the awards under tbe Convention of the 25th of April, 1868. That Republic is nnderstood to be now almost, if not quite, trarquilized. It is hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time in Sroviding for the unpaid balances of its ebt to the United States, which having originate! in injuries to its citizens by tbe Veneznelan authorities, and having been ac knowledged pursuant to a treaty in the most solemn form known among nations, would seem to deserve a preference 6ver debts cf a different origin and contracted in a different manner. This subject is again recommenaea to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. Our treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. An imposing embassy from that interesting and progressive nation visited this country during the year that is passing, out being unproviaea wim powers for the signing of a convention in this coun try, no conclusion in that direction was reached. It is hoped, however, that the in terchange of opinions which too place dur ing their stay in this country had led to a mutual appreciation of the interests which miy be promoted when the revision of the existing treaty shall be 'undertaken. In this connection I renew my recom mendation of one year ago that to give im portance and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further aid in maintaining the good opinion of these people, and secure to the United States its share of the commerce des tined te flow between these nations and the balance of the commercial world, an appro priation be made to support at least four American youths in each of these countries, to serve as a part of the official family of our Minister there. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain or some other powers. Ab now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of those countries who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the oo casion tbe services of employes in foreign business houses, or the interpreters to other foreign Ministers. I renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion of the transfer to the De partment of the Interior, to which theyseim more appropriately to belong, of all the powers and duties in relation to the territo ries with which the Department of State is now changed by law or by custom. Congress, from the beginning of the Gov ernment, has wisely made provision for the relie" of distressed seamen in foreign coun tries. No similar provision, however, has hitherto been made for tbe relief of citizens in distress abroad other than seamen. It is understood to bo customary with other Gov ernments to authorize Consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects in certain eases. A similar authority and an appropria tion to curry it into effect are commended in cases of citizens of the United States, desti tute or sick, under such circumstances. is well known that euch citizens resort foreign countries in great numbers; though most of them are aHe to bear the expenses incident to locomotion, there are some who, through accidentor otherwise, becoming pen niless, and have no friends at home able succor them. Persons in his situation must either perish.cast themselves upon thecharity of foreigners, or be relieved at the private charge ot our officers, who usually, even with tho most benevolent disposition, have nothing to spare lor such purposes. Should the authority and appropriation asked for be given, care will be taken to carry the beneficence i f Congress into effect, that shall not be unnecassarily or unworthily bo stowed. From tho foregoing statement it appears that the next reduction of the principal the dobt durinr the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, was $99,960,253.54. The source the reduction- is as follows: Net ordinary receipts during the year, $364,694,229.91; net to to it of of ordinary expenditures, including interest on public debt, 727V.5S,695.91: total, $94,134,- 534. Add amount of receipts from premium on eales of gold, in excess of the premiums paid en bonds purchased, $2,454,470.89: add amount of redaction of the cash balance at the close of the year, accompanied with the sales at the commencement of the year, $337,343.65; total, $99,960,253.54. This state ment treats sole'y of the public debt. By the monthly statement of the public debt, which adds together the principal and in terest due and unpaid and the interest ac crued to date due, and deducts the cash in tbe Treasury, accordingly on that day cf publication the reduction was $100,544, 491.28. The source of this reduction is as follows: Reduction in principal account, $99,960,003.54; reduction in unpaid interest account, $3,330,952.96; total, $103,290,958.50. Rsduction in cash on hand, $2,746,465.22; total, $100,544,491.28. On the basis of the last table the statements show a reduction of the public debt from tbe 1st of March, 1869, to tbe present time as follows: From March 1, 1869, to March 1, 1870, $87,134,782 84; from March 1, 1870, to March 1, 1871, $117, 619,630 25; from March 1, 1871, to March 1, 1872, $94,895,348.94; from March 1,1772, to Nov. 1, 1872,. eight months, $64,047,237 84. Total, $363,698,999.87. With the great re duction of taxation by the acts of Congress at its last session the expenditures of the Government in collecting the revenue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtfub however, whether any further reduction of so vexatious a burden upon any people will be practicable for the present." At all events, as a measure of jus tice to the holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness, I would recommend that no more legislation be had on the subjectunless it be to correct errors of omission in the present laws, until sufficient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still have sufficient revenue to meet the current ex penses ot the Government, pay interest on the public debt, and provide for the sinking fund established by law. The preservation of our national credit is of the highest im portance, next in importance to this comes a solemn duty to provide a national curren cy, of fixed, unvaryingv aluejas compared with gold; aad as soon as practicable, hav ing due regard for the interests of the debtor class and the vicissititndes of trade and commerce, and convertible into gold at par.- The report of the Secretary of War shows the expenditures of the War Department for the fiscal year endine June 30, 1871, to be $35,799,991.82; and for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, to be $35,372,157.20, showing a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of $427,834.02. The at ention cf Congress will be' called during its present session to various enter prises for the more certain and cheaper transportation of the constantly increasing surplus ot the western and southern pro ducts to the Atlantic seaboard.' The sub ject is one that will force itself upon the legislative branch ot the uovernment sooner er later, aad I suggest, therefore, that im mediate steps oe taken to gam ail available information to insure equitable and just legis lation. The route connecting tho Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic, at Charleston, S. C, and Savannah, Ga., by water, by the way of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers and canals and slack water navigation to tbe Savannah and Ocmulgee rivers, has been surveyod and re port made by an accomplished engineer of the army. - Second aad third new routes will be proposed ior the cot sideralion ot uon- greBs, namely, by an extension of tbe Kana wha and James river canal to the Uhio, and by extension of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. I am not prepared to recommend Government aid to those or other enterprises, until it is clearly shown that they are not only of national interest, but that when com plete they will be ot a value commensurate with their cost. That production increases more rapidly than tbe means of transporta tion in our country, has been demonstrated by past experience. That the unprecedent ed growth in population and products of the whole country will require additional facili ties and cheaper means for the more bulky articles of commerco to reach tide water and a market will be demanded in the near fu ture is equal.'y demonstrable. I would there fore suggest either that a committee or com missioner be authorized to consider this whole Question, and to report to Congress at some future day for its better guidance in legislating on tho important subject. The railroads ot tbe country have bean rapidly extended during the last few years to meet tne growing demands ot producers, ana re flect much credit upon the capitalists and managers engazed in this construction. In addition to these, a project to facilitate com merce by the building of a ship canal around Niagara Falls, on the United States side, which has been agitated for many years, will no doubt be called to your attention this session. Looking to the great future of the country and the increasing demands of com merce, it might be well, while on this sub ject, not only to have examined and report- el upon, the various practicable routes for connecting the Mississippi with tide-water, but the feasibility ot an almost continuous land-locked navigation from Maine to tbe Gulf of Mexico. Such a route along our coast would be or great value at all times, and of inestimable value in case of a foreign war. Nature hus provided the greater part of this route, and the obstacles to be overcome are easily within the skill of the engineer. I have not alluded to this subieet with tbe view of having any further expenditure of public money, at this time, than may be necessary to procure and place the necessary information before Congress in an authentic form to enable it hereafter, if deemed prac ticable and worthy, to legislate on the sub ject without delay. The report of the Secretary of the Navy, herewith accompanying, explains fully the condition cf that branch of the public ser vice, its wants and deficiencies, expenses in curred during the past year, end appropria tions tor the same, it also gives a complete history of the service of the Navy for the past year, in addition to its regular services. It is evident that unless steps are taken to preserve our Navy, that in a very few years the United States will be the-weakest nation upon the ocean of all the great powers. With an energetic, progressive, business peo ple like ours, penetrating and forming busi ness relations with every part ot tne Known world, a navy strong enough to command the respect of our flag abroad is necessary for the full protection of their rights. I re commend careful consideration by Congress of the recommendations made by the foecre tary of the Navy. The accompanying report of the Postmas ter General furnishes a full and satisfactory exhibit of the operations of the Postoffice Department during the year. The ordinary revenues of the Dapartment for the fiscal Ten onding June 30. 1872. amounted to $21.- 915,426.37, and tho expenditures $26,658, 192.21. Compared with the previous fiscal year, the increase of revenue was $1,878,- 380.95, or 9.37 rer cent., and the increase of expenditures $2,268,088 23, or 9.29 per cent. Addinz to the ordinary revenues the annual appropriation of $700,000 for free matter, and the amounts paid in subsidies on mail steam ship lines from special appropriations, the general Treasury was d,di7,7K5.U4 an ex cess of $389,707.28 over the deficiency for the vear 1871. Other interesting statistical information, relating to our rapidly extend ing postal service, is furnished in this report. The total length of railroad mail routes on the 30th of June, 1872, was 67.911 miles: 8,077 miles of Buch service having been put into operation during tbe year. Eight new lines of railway postal service have been es ta.bliRhn.-1. with an aggregate length of 2.909 miles. The number of letters exchanged in the mails with foreign countries was 3,066,502, or 20 per cent, over the number in 1871, and the postage thereon amounts to $1,871,257.25. The total weight of the mails exchanged with European countries exceeded 820 tons. The cost of the United Staie3 trans-Atlantic mail steamship service was $220,301.70. The total cost of the United States ocean steamship service, including the amounts paid to the subsidized lines of mail steamers was $1,027,020 97. The following are the only steamship lines now receiving subsidies for mail service under special aots of Con gress: The Pacific Mail Steamship Compa ny receive $500,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between San Francisco, Japan, and China, which will be increased to $1,000,000 Der annum, and a semi-monthly mail on and after October 1,1873. The United States and Brazil Mail Steamship Company leceive $150,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between New York and Rio Janeiro, Brazil; and the California, Oregon, and Mexico Steamship Company receive $75,000 per annum for carrying a monthly mail between San Francisco, Honolulu, and Hawayan Islands' Making the total amount of mail steamship subsidies at present $725, 000 per annnm. Our postal communication with all parts of the civilized world have been placed upon a most advantageous foot ing by the improved postal conventions and arrangements recently concluded with the leading commercial countries ot .Europe and America, and the gratifying statement is made that, with the conclusion of a satisfac tory convention with Franco, the details of which have been definitely agreed to by the head of the French Postal Department, sub ject to the approval of the Minister of France, lime remains to do accompiisnea oy treaty for some time to come, in respect to reduc tion of rate, or improved facilities for postal intercourse. 1 have heretofore cemmended the abolition of the franking privilege, and see no reason now for changing my views on that subject. It not having been favorably regarded by Congress, however, I now suggest a modifi cation of that privilege to correct its glaring and costly abuses. I would recommend also the appointment of a committee or commission to take into considerations the best method, equitable to private corporation who have invested their time and capital in the establishment of tel egraph lines, of acquiring the title to all tel egraph lines now in operation, and of con necting this service with the postal service of the nation. It is not probable that this subject could receive the proper considera tion during the limits of a short session in Congress, but it may be initiated, so that further action may be fair to the Govern ment and to private parties concerned. ""he report of the Secretary of the Treasury will show an alarming falling off in our car rying trade, for the last ten or twelve years, and even for the past year. I do not believe that the public treasure can be better ex pended in the interest of the whole people than in trying ta recover this trade. An expenditure of nve million dollars per annum for the next five years, if it would restore to us our proportion of the carrying trade of the world wonld be profitably ex tended. The price of labor in Europe has so much enhanced with the last few years that the cost ot building and operating ocem steamers in the United States is not so much greater than in Europe that I believe the time has arrived for congress to take this subject into serious consideration.' Detailed statements of tbe disbursements. though the Department of Justice will be furnished by the Attorney General, and though these have been somewhat increased by the recent acts of Congress to enforce the right of citizens of the Uaited States to vote ia the several States of the Union, and to force the provisions of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the amendment thereto, I cannot question the necessity and salutary effect of these enact ments. Reckless and lawless men, I regret to say, have associated themselves together in some localities to deprive other citizens of the right gutranteed them by the Constitu tion ot the United etates, and to that end have committed deeds -of violonce, but tbe prevention and punishment of many of these persons have tended greatly to the repression of such disorder. I do not doubt that a great majority of the people of all parts of the country favor the lull enjoyment by all classes of persons of these rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution. and the laws, and to invoke aid and influence of all good citizens to prevent organizations whose objects are by unlawful means to interfere with those rignts. I look with confidence to tbe time not far distant when tbe obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an aban donment ct all combinations prohibited by the acts referred to, and when it will be un necessary to carry on the prosecutions or in flict punishments to protect citizens from the lawless doings of such combinations. Applications have been made to me to par don persona convicted of a violation of said acts upon the ground that clemecy in such cases would tend to tranquilize the public mind, and to test the virtue of that policy I am disposed, es far as my sense of justice will permit, to give to these applications a favorable consideration, butany action there on is not to be constructed as indicating any change in my determination to enforce with vigor such act so long as the conspiracies and conmbinations therein named disturb the peace of the country. It is much to be regretted, and is regretted by none mors than myself that a necessity has ever ex isted to execute the enforcement act. jmo one can desire more than that necessity of applying it may never arain be demanded. Tho secretary ot the interior reports satis factory improvement and progression in each of tbe severa' bu eaus under the control of the Interior Department. They are all in excellent condition. The work which in some of them for some years has been in arrears has oeen brought down to a recent date, and in all the current business h been promptly despatched. The policy which was adopted at tbe be ginning of the Administration with regard to the management of the Indians has been as successful as its most ardent friends an ticipated within so short a time. It has re duced the expense of their management, decreased their forage uoon the white settle ments, tended to give the largest opportunity to the extension of the great railways through the public domain and tbe pushing ot set tlement into the more remote distr cts of the country and at the same time Improve tha condition of the Indians. The policy will he maintained without any change, excepting such as farther expe rience may show to be necessary to render it more efficient. Tho eubjrct of converting the so-called Indian Territory, south of Kansas, into a home for the Indians, and entering thoreon a Territorial form of govr ernment, is one ot groat importance ss compliment of the existing Indian policy, The question oi removal to the Territory has within the past year been presented to many of the tribes resident upon other and less favorable portions of the public domain, and has generally been received by them as a preliminary Btep to the organization of such a territory will be necessary to confine the Indians now resident therein to firms of proper size, which should be secured to them in fea, the residue to be used for tbe settle ment of other friendly Indians. Efforts will be made in tbe immediate future to induce the removal of as many peaceable-disposed Indians only to tbe Indian Territory as can te settled properly without disturbing "the harmony of those already there. There is no ether location now available where people who are endeavoring to acquire knowledge of pastoral and agricultural pur suits can be as well accommodated as upon the unoccupied lands of tbe Indian Terri tory." i x Affairs in the Territories are generally satisfactory. The energy and business ca pacity of the pioneers who are settling up the vast domain not yet incorporated into States, are keeping pace in internal improve ments and civil government with the older communities. In but one of them, Utah, is the condition of affairs unsatisfactory, ex cept so far as the quiet of the citizens may be disturbed by the real or imaginary danger of Indian hostilities. It has seemed to be the policy of the Legislature of Utah to evade all responsibility to the Government of the United States, and even to hold i position in hostility to it. l recommend a careful revision of the laws of the Territory by congress and tbe enactment ot such a law as the one proposed in Congress at its last session, for instance, or something simi lar to it, as will secure peace, the equality of ail citizens before the law and the ultimate relinquishment of polygamy. Slates and Territories where mining is the principal biainess, agricultural products have exceeded the local demand and liberal shipments have Doen mace to distant points. The ninth census is about completed. Its completion Is a subject of congratulation, inasmuch as the use to be made of the sta tistics therein contained depends very greatly on the promptitude of publication. The Becretary of the Interior recommends that a census be taken ii. 1857, which recommenda tion should receive the ready attention of Congress. The interval at present estab lished between the Federal census is so long that the information obtained at the decimal periods to the material condition, wants and resources of the nation is of little practical value. After the expiration of the first half ef that period, it would probably obviate the constitutional provision regarding the decimal census, if a census taken in 1875 should be divested of all political character, and no apportionment of Congressional rep resentation bo made under it. Such a cen sus, coming as it would in the last year of the first century of our national existence, would furnish a nob:e monument of the progress of the United States during that century. The rapidly increasing interest m educa tion is a most encouraging feature in the cur rent history of the country, and it is no doubt true that thia is due in a great measure to the efforts of the Bureau of Education. That office is continually Tec jiving evidences which abundantly proves Its efficiency, from the various institutions of learning and edu cators of all kinds throughout tbe country. xne report of tne commissioner contains a vast amount of educational details of great interest. The bill now pending before Con gress, providing for the appropriation of the proceeds' of the sales of pnblic lands for edu cation of their rising generation, is a meas ure ot such great impoitance to our real pro gress, and is so unanimously approved by the leading friends of education, that com -mend it to the favorable attention of Con gress. The report of the Commissioner of Agri culture gives a very full and Interesting ac count of the several divisions of that depart ment. The horticultural, agricultural, statistical, entomological and chemical, and the beneuts conferred by each upon tbe agri cultural interests of the country. The whole reports a complete history in total of the workings of that department in all its branches, showing the manner in which the farmer, merchant and miner is informed and the extent to which he is aided in his pur-' su ts. The Commissioner makes one recom mendation that measures be taken by Con gress to protect and reduce the planting ot forests, and suggests that no part ot the pub lic lands should be disposed without the con dition that one-tenth of it be reserved in timber where it exists, and where it does not exist inducements should be oflored by planting it. in accordance with the terms ot the act oi Congress approved March 3, 1871, providing for the celebration of the one hundredth an niversary of American independence, a Com mission has been organized, consisting of the two members from each of the States and Territories. The Commission has held two sessions, and t as made satisfactory progress in the organization and in toe initiatory steps necessaryfor the carryingoutof the provisions of the act, and for exceeding the provisions also of the act of June 1, 1871, creating a continual Board ef Finance. A preliminary report ef piogress has been received from the President of the Commission, and is herewith transmitted. It will be the duty of the Commission at your coming session to transmit a report of the progress made, and to lay beiore you tne details relating to the exhibition of American and foreign arts, products and manufacturers which, by the term of the act, is to be held under the auspices of the Government of the United States in the city of Philadelphia in the year 1876. This celebration will be looked lorward to by American citizens with great interest, as making a century of greater progress ana prosperity uiau ia revurucu in the history of any other nation, and proving a further good purpose in bringing together on our soil the people of all the commeicial nations oi tne eann, in a manner cucuiawu to Becure international good leeung. An earnest desire has been felt to correct abuses which have grown up in the civil service oi the country, through the defective method of making appointments to office, which have been, regarded too mucn as tne reward of political services. Under the au thority of Congress rules have been estab lished to regulate the terms of office and he mode of appointment. It cannot be expect ed that any system of rule can be entirely effective and prove a perfect remedy for the existing evils till they have been thoroughly tested by actual practice and amended ac cording to the requirements of the service. During my term ct otnee it shall be my oest endeavor to so apply the rules as to secure the greatest possible relorm in the civil ser vice of the Government. But it will require the direct action of Congress to render the enforcement of the system binding upon my successors, and I hope that the experience of the past year,' together with appropriate legislation bv Congress, may reach a satisfac tory solution of this quest'on, and secure to the publio service lor all time a practical method of obtaining faithful nd efficient U. S.
