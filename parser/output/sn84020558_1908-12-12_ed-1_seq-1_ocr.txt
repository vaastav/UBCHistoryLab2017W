PUBLMMW PROPHET UP 11 STUMP Adam God Said it Was Fault of His Faith the SUBSEQUENT REVELATION When the Bullets of the Kan sas City Police Began to Hit Him-He Suspects That the Almighty Was Away on a Vacation. Kansas City. Dec. 11. "The Lord either was not with us, or was on a vacation. My faith was wrong, I wal mistaken." That is the statement of James Sharp better known as "Adam God" who was captured in Kansas yesterday. It was Sharp who led his followers in the battle with the police that resulted in Ae deaths. A. J. Selzer, aged seventy two, an innocent bstander, wounded by a stray bullet, died t midnight last v night. It is a penitent and humble prophet that sits in his cell in the police station with the responsibility for five deaths upon him, but he insists that he was misguided and acted in good faith. '"I believed it was God's will, When the bullets commenced to hit me then I had a revelation. I am glad to be back and to stand for any thing God wills. I had a nice farm in Oklahoma and was doing well when I believed I was called. Now I have no money. My children have left me and I have murdered innocent men. ."I'm up a stump, brother. But it was all the fault of the faith: I saw it all as soon as the bullet hit me." "I "I'M'' , tQ , he fc'''ey added Sharp in answer to a question, "I don't Ciire how soon. l.f-r husban 1 was captured, and she was told that he had been wounded Mrs. Sh:irp who is also in Jail, said: "then there is little for me to pin my faith to." o PENNSYLVANIA GRAFTERS DENIED A NEW TRIAL The Men Convicted of Frauds in the Capitol Case to be Sentenced Next Friday.

At a recent meeting of the diplomatic corps at Port Au Prince, Havtl, the decision was reached that it was not opportune at this time to have the government's representatives formally recognize the administration of General Simon for the reason that this action perhaps would give him an advantage over his competitors in the election for presi dent.

Banquet Reflects Glory of the BEAUTIFUL DISAPPOINTMENT Joyous Confusion of Unboun ded Success,' Exhilirating toTh6se Who Were Pleas irigly Put Out-The Lesson of it is Self Taught The Prosperity banquet of the board of trade last -night was a real eye opener. It was the most pleasant Hind of a disappointment to everybody there, for everybody was disappointed one way or another. The committee which had worked hard for .its ar rangement, found its troubles increas ing clear to the last minute and the more trouble there was the better the committee liked it because of its na ture. A week ago the committee which was presided over by Dwight B. Heard, was fearful lest sufficient interest w-ouldjfot be aroused to make it a success. Thursday night about 150 tickets had been disposed of, an am ple number to assure success if ticket holders ail put iu appearance but there was a feeling 'that too many might consider it in the light of duty instead of pleasure and stop with buy ing tickets. The time was extended until 10 o'clock yesterday, to make sure. By that hour fifty more had bought tick-J ets and it was necessary then to call a halt. Nevertheless the people kept coming a,nd Gass Brothers who served as caterer in a most admirable and satisfactory manner told the commit tee they would try and handle another fifty, makftjg Ir,0 Covers. They were accepted and fctill the people applied for tickets ujntil it became absolutely necessary to refuse another fifty or spoil the whole game. The result was that about 250, the full capacity of the Melcrer hall for such nn occasion, sat down to the festive board, though the confusion necessitated nearly an hour's dehiy In the service for which the caterers were in no way to be blamed. The proceedings until 11 o'clock were entirely too comprehensive for other than a general comment. The purpose of the banquet was effected fully and in overflowing measure, that purpose being solely tp develop a spir it of Interest in the prosperity of this valley, through cultivating the social side of cooperation, and in this case sociability should not be confounded with conventionality, for aristocracy rubbed elbows with the sons of the soil and the minor and prospector in terchanged ideas witn the doctor and the lawyer, while the artisan and the cowboy compared notes with the banker. The membership of the board of trade now numbers approximately 400. If it Is not swelled to 1000 before another April morning, there is some thing wrong with the signs of the times and they were not read aright last night. ' Comment can be made at this time on no particular speech for there wasn't a bad one in the lot and the appended list indicates the wide range of subjects, covered as adequately as they could by in five minute talks. Dr. Foss, president of the board of trade presided in his mouf gracious way and as indicative of the good feeling that prevailed, he was called down by the chairman at the end of five minutes in his own. the initial and explanatory speech of the evening, as was almost every speaker who fol lowed. A feature of ihe evening was the; reading of a telegram by Mr. Heard, appropriately following references to statehood, received yesterday after noon from E. L. Hamilton, chairman of the congressional committee on terri tories, and at one time considered an enemy of the statehood movement. Following Is the telegram: Washington, D. G, Dec. 11. Hon. Dwight B. Heard, Phoenix. Ariz. Matters have not proceeded far enough to enable me to wire you with, such definiteness as to time of action as you would desire. That the party- platform and the president's recom mendation will be 'enacted into law, however, I have no doubt. E. L.

Three' wool growers were the only witnesses heard by the house ways and means committee in the tariff hearing today. R. G. Johnson of Blackfoot, Idaho, who had been on the stand before, returned to' give the4committee fig ures on the cost of raising sheep. The figures showed that the profit on a flock of sheep in Idaho is ten per cent.

New Tork, Dec. 1. From the rec ords of- the Standard's exhibits. Mr. Kellogg read figures at the trial today showing that in 1895 the ..Standard manufactured forty million barrels of refined oil, with a net earning of $24. 078.000 or a net profit of sixty cents a barrel; in 1896 it manufactured sixty-four million barrels of oil. with a net profit of $83,000,000, or $1.30 per barrel. "Do you think a general rise of com modities justified a profit of more than 10 per cent in any one commo dity?" asked Kellogg. "Economics have had a hard time in determining, what a reasonable profit is," responded Prof. Johnson.. The witness could pot be induced to say that he thought a "profit of 100 per cent and . more was outside the bounds of reason. Mr. Rosenthal objected to the gen eral tenor of Mr. Kellogg's questions contending that it had not been shown that $1.30 a barrel profit came exclu sively from the manufacture of oil.
