WWWHWWWWWli PRESIDENT'SMESSAGE 1 President Roosevelt's annual incssago baa been delivered to congress. Open ing with a plea for the co-operntlon of all classes In continuing tlio country's prosperity and In correcting existing ,evlls, for a "square deal" for every- 5ody, tho messngo first takes up tho uestlon of corporations and railroad tate legislation. Tho president says: I Corporations. i I am in no senso hostile to corpora tions. This Is nu ago of combination, nud any effort to prevent nil combina tion wilt bo not only useless, but in tho end vicious, because of tho contempt for law which tho failure to euforco Inw Inevitably produces. The corpora tion has come to stay, Just as tho trades union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should bo favored so long its It does good. But each should bo sharply checked where It acts against law and justice. Experience has shown conclusively that It Is useless to try to get any ade quate regulation and supervision of these great corporations by stato ac tion. Such regulation and supervision cau only bo effectively exercised by n sovereign whose Jurisdiction Is coox tenslvo with tho Held work of tho cor porations that Is, by the national gov ernment. I bellevo that this regulation end supervision cau bo obtained by tho enactment of law by the congress. If this proves Impossible, It will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer In fullest form such power upon tho na tional government by affirmative ac nicnt of tho constitution. Tho laws of the congress and of tho sovcral states hitherto, its passed upon py tho courts, have resulted more often In showing that tho states have no power lu tho matter than that the na tional government has power; so that .there at present exists a very unfortu nate condition of things, under which 'these great corporations doing an In terstate business occupy the position of subjects without a sovereign, neither any state government nor the national (government having, effective control 'over them. Our steady aim should bo ly legislation, cautiously and carefully .undertaken, but resolutely persevered In, to assert the sovereignty of the na tional government by afflrmatlvo ac tion. 1 This Is only in form an Innovation. Hit substance It Is merely a restoration, ifor from the earliest tlmo such regula tion of Industrial activities has been (recognized In tho action of the Inw 'inaklng bodies, and nil that I propose rls to meet the changed conditions In .such manner as will prevent tho com monwealth abdicating the power It has (always possessed, not only in this coun try, but also In England before and lnce this country became a separato nation. , Itailroad Ilate Legislation. As I said lit my message of Dec. 0 last, the Immediate and most pressing neeU 'so for as legislation Is concerned jls the enactment Into law of some scheiuo to secure to the agents of tho iBovefnment such supervision and regu lation; of the rates charged by the rail roads of tho country engaged In luter 8tnteflr,afflc as shall summarily and ef fectively prevent tho imposition of un Ijust or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to re bates In every shapo and form. This .power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over tho business world, should ibo exercised with moderation, caution und self restraint, but it should exist, bo that It can bo effectively exercised when the need arises. In my Judgment, the most Important provision which such law should con tain Is that coufcrrlng upon somo com petent administrative body tho power to decide upon the caso being brought before It whether a given rate pro scribed by a railroad Is reasonable and just, and if It Is found to bo unreason able and unjust then, after full lnvcsti 'gatlon of tho complaint, to prescrlbo tho limit of rato beyond which It shall Inot be lawful to go tho maximum reasonable rate, as It is commonly call edthis decision to go into effect with in a rcasonablo tlmo and to obtain from thenco onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate Is too high, but that a fa vored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case tho commission would jhavo the right to fix this already estab lished minimum rato as tho maximum, and It would need only one or two such decisions by tho commission to euro railroad companies of tho practlco of giving improper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my pro posal Is not to glvo tho commission ipower to Initiate or orlglnato rates gen erally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by tho roads upon complaint and after Investigation. A heavy penalty should bo exacted from !any corporation which falls to respect bin order of tho commission. I regard ithls power to establish a maximum jrato as being essential to any schemo of real reform In tho matter of railway regulation. ,1 It Is worth while considering whether It would not be wise to coufer on the government the right of civil action egalnst tho beneficiary of n robato for at least twlco tho value of tho rebate. This would help stop what Is really blackmail. Elevator allowances should bo stopped, for they havo now grown to such an extent that they aro demor alizing and are used as rebates. Private Car Line. All prlvato car lines. Industrial roads, refrigerator charges and tho llko should bo expressly put under tho su pervision of tho I ntern tn to commerce commission or some similar body so far ns rates and agreements' practical ly affecting rates nro coucorned. .A re bate In leiug charges or In nillcngo oc In n division of the rato for refrigerating charges Is Just as pernicious ns a re bate lu any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common canlers. Only In this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted Into the national banks by the bank examiners. A few first class railroad accountants, If they had prop er direction nnd proper authority to. In spect books and papers, could accom plish much lu preventing willful viola tions of the law. Employers' Liability Lnvr. In my annual message to the Flfty eighth congress at Its second session I recommended the passage of an em ployers' liability law for the District of Columbia and lu our navy yards. I re newed that recommendation in my message to the Fifty-eighth congress at its' second session nnd further suggest ed tho appointment of a commission to make a comprehensive study of em ployers' liability with a view to the en actment of a wise and constitutional law covering the subject, applicable to all Industries within tho scope of tho federal power. I hope that such n law will bo prepared and enacted as speed ily ns possible. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes. Such special limita tion of the equity powers of our courts would be most unwise. It Is true that some judges havo misused this power, but this does not Justify a denial of tho power any'moro than an Improper ex ercise of the power to call a strike by a labor leader would Justify the denial of the right to strike. Tho remedy Is to regulate tho procedure by requiring tho Judgo to glvo duo notfeo to the adverse parties before granting tho writ, tho hearing to be ex parte If tho adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered. What Is duo notice must depend upon tho facts of Ibo case. It should not bo used ns a pretext to per mit violation of law or tho Jeopardiz ing of life or property. Of course this would not authorize the Issuing of u restraining order or Injunction In any ease In which it Is not already author ized by existing law. I renew tho recommendation 1 mnde In my last annual message for an In vestigation by the department of com merce and labor of general labor condi tions, especial attention to bo paid to tho conditions of child labor and child labor legislation in tho heveral states. Such an Investigation should take Into account the various problems -"ItU which the question of child lab Is connected. In such a republic as ours tho one thing that we cannot nffoid to neglect Is the problem of turning out decent citizens. The future of the na tion depends upon tho citizenship of tho generations to come. Tho children of today are those who tomorrow will shape tho destiny of our land, nud wo cannot afford to neglect them. The leg islature of Colorado has recommended that tho national government provide some general measure for tho protec tion front abuse of children and dumb nulntals throughout the United States, I lay the matter before you for what I trust will be your favorable consider ation. An to 'Women Who Work. The department of commerce and la bor should also make n thorough Inves tigation of tho conditions of women lu industry. Over 0,000,000 American wo men are now engaged In gainful occu pations, yet there Is au almost completo dearth of data upon which to base any trustworthy conclusions as regards a subject as Important ns It Is vast and complicated, Tho introduction of wo men Into Industry Js working change and disturbance in the domestic and soqlal life of the nation. The decrcaso in marriage, and especially in tho birth rate, has been coincident with It. Wo must face accomplished facts, and tho , adjustment to factory conditions must bo made, but surely It can bo made with less friction nud less harmful ef fects on family life than Is now tho case. This whole matter In reality 1 forms one of the greatest sociological phenomena of our time. It Is a social question of the first Importance, of far greater importance than any merely po litical or economic question can be. In nny great labor disturbance not only nro employer and employee Inter ested, but also a third party tho geu- , oral public. Every considerable labor difficulty in which Interstate commerco Is Involved should bo investigated by tho government nnd tho facts officially reported to tho public. Ilnsnrunec. Tho great Insurance companies afford striking examples of corporations whose business has extended so far beyond tho jurisdiction of tho states which created them as to precludo strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by the parent stntes. In my last annual messngo I recommended "that tho congress carefully consider whether tho power of tho bureau of corporations cannot constitutionally bo extended to cover lutcrstato transac tions in insurance." Itecent events have emphasized tho Importance of an early and cxhaustlvo consideration of this question, to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than tho several states havo been nblo to furnish itgalnst corruption of tho flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clenrly shown that certain of tho men nt tho head of theso largo corporations tako but small noto of the ethical distinction between honesty and dishonesty. They draw the lino only this sldo of what may bo called law honesty, tho kind of honesty necessary In order to avoid falling Into tho clutches of tho law. Of courso tho only complete remedy for this condi tion must bo found lu an aroused pub lic conscience, n higher senso of ethical conduct in tho community nt largo nnd especially nmong business men and In the great profession of tho law, and In the growth of n spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether lu rich mnn or In poor man, whether It takes thohapo f bribery or of blackmail. Hut much tan bo done by legislation which Is not uuly drastic, but practical. There Is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast Insurance Interests of this country. The United Stutes should In this respect follow the policy of other nations by providing adequate national supervision of com mercial Interests which are clearly na tional In character. I repeat nty previous recommenda tion that the congress should consider whether the federal government has nny power or owes any duty with re spect to domestic transactions In In surance of nn Interstate character. That stato supervision has proved In adequate U generally conceded. Tho Ueomicii. There Is more need of stability than of the nttempt to attain an Ideal per fection In the methods of raising rev enue, and the shock and strain to tho business world certain to attend nny serious change In theso methods ren der such change Inadvisable unless for grave reason. It Is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons, for will outweigh tho reasons against buch a change. No change can be made on lines beneficial to or desired by ono section or one state only. Thero must be something like a general agree ment amofig the citizens of the several slates that the change Is needed nud desired In the Interest of the people us n whole, nnd there should then bo a sin cere, Intelligent nnd disinterested ef fort to make It In such shape as will combine, so far ns possible, the mnxl mum of good to tho people at largo with the minimum of necessary disre gard for tho special Interests of locali ties or classes, but In tlmo of peace tho revenue must, on the average, taking a series of years together, equal tho expenditures or else tho revenues must bo Increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can bo kept within tho revenues then our revenue laws must bo readjusted. It Is Impossible to outline what shape such o readjustment should tako, for It Is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for It. It should bo considered whether It Is not desirable that the tariff laws should provide for applying as against or In fnvor of any other nation maximum nnd minimum tariff rates established by the congress, so as to secure n certain reciprocity of treatment between other nations nnd ourselves. Economy In Expcndltnrcs. I earnestly recommend to the con gress the need of economy nnd, to this end, of a rigid scrutiny of appropria tions. All unnecessary offices should be abolished. In the public printing nlso a largo saving of money can be made. Thero Is a constantly growing tendency to publish masses of unim portant Information at which no human being ever looks. Yet, In speaking of economy, I must In nowlso be understood ns advocating the false economy which Is In tho end, tho worst extravagance. To cut down In tho navy would bo n crime ngalnst tho nation. To fall to push forward all work on tho Panama canal would bo as great a folly. Currency. Every consideration of prudence de mands tho addition of tho element of elasticity to our currency system. Tho evil does not consist In an Inadequate volume of money, but In the rigidity of this volume, which does not respond ns It should to tho varying needs of communities nnd of seasons. Inflation must bo nvoldcd, but some provision should bo mndo that will lnsuro n larger volume of money during the fall nnd winter mouths than In tho 1033 ac tive seasons of the year, so that tho currency will contract ngalnst specula tion and will expand for tho needs of legitimate business. At "present the treasury department Is nt Irregularly recurring Intervals obliged In the inter est of tho business world that Is, in I tho Interests of tho American public to try to avert financial crises by pro viding u remedy which should bo pro vided by congressional action, riiiNliieLK Methods In Diimrtmcnts. At various times 1 have Instituted In vestigations Into tho organization and conduct of the business of the execu tive departments. While none of these Inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final conclusions, they have already confirmed and em phaulzcd tho general Impression that tho organization of tho departments Is often faulty In principle and wasteful In results, while many of thqlr business methods aro antiquated and Inefficient. I recommend that tho congress consider this bitbject. Federal Elections. In my hist annual message J said "Tho power of the government ernment to protect tho Integrity of tho elections of Its own officials Is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by re-1 pouted declarations of tho supremo court. Thero is no enemy of freo gov ernment more dangerous and nono so -insidious ns tho corruption of tho elect orate. Ko ono defends or excuses cor-' juptlon, nud It would seem to follow that nono would opposo vigorous meas ures to eradicate It. I recommend tho enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption In federal elec tions. Tho details of such a law ntny bo safely loft to tho wise discretion of the congress, but it should go us far as under tho constitution It Is possible to go nnd should include sevcro penalties against ilm who gives or receives n brlbo Intended to influenco his net or opinion as nn elector and provisions for tho publication not only of tlio expend itures for nominations and elections of nil candidates, but also of nil contribu tions received nnd expenditures mndo by political committees." ' I desire to repeat this recommendation. All contributions by 'corporations to any political committee or for any po litical -purposo should be forbidden by 1AW, directors should not bo permitted to use stockholders' money for such pin poses, nud, moreover, n prohibition of- this kind would be, ns far as It went, an effeetivo method of stopping the evils aimed nt In corrupt practices nets. Tho Hiiruc Conference. Tho first conference of nations held i.t Tho Hague In 1800, being uuablo to dlsposo of nil the business beforo It, recommended tlio consideration and settlement of n number of Important questions by another confereuco to bo called subsequently nnd nt an early date. Those questions wcto tho follow ing: (1) Tho rights and duties of neu trals; (2) the limitation of tho armed forces on laiul and sea and of military budgets; (3) tho ii3o of new types nnd calibers of military and naval guns; (i) tho inviolability of private property at sea In times of war; (5) the bombard ment of ports, cltlc3 and vllluges by na val forces. In October, 1004, nt tho In stance of tlio Interparliamentary union, I Issued Invitations to all the powers signatory to Tho Hague convention to send delegates to such a conference nnd suggested that It bo again held nt Tho Ilagiio. Front nil tho powers acceptance was received, coupled In some case's with the condition that wo should wait until the end of tho war then waging be tween Itussla and Japan. Tho emperor of Itussln, Immediately after tho treaty of peace which so happily terminated this war, In n noto presented to tho president on Sept 13 took the Initiative In recommending that the conference be now called. The United Stntes gov ernment In response expressed Its cor dial ncqulcscenco nud stated that It would as a matter of courso take part In the now conference nnd endeavor to further Its alms. We assume that all civilized governments will support tho movement nnd Unit tho conference Is now an assured fact. This government will do everything In Its power to se cure the success of the conference to the end that substantial progress may bo made In tho cause of International peace, justice and good will. ' Monroe Doctrine. ' Thero nro certain essential points which must never bo forgotten ns re gards the Monroe doctrine. In the first place, we must as a nation mnko It ev ident thnt we 'do not Intend to treat It in any shapo or way as an excuse for aggrandizement ou our part ut tho ex pense of tho republics to tho south. But wo must mnko It evident that wo do not Intend to permit the Monroe doc trine to bo used by any nation on this continent as n shield to protect it from tho cousequeuccs of its own misdeeds against foreign nations. The Monroe doctrine does not force us to luterfero to prevent tho punishment of a port save to see that tho punishment does not assume the form of territorial occu pation in any shape. The caso is moro difficult when it refers to n contractual obligation. This country would cer tainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt. Ou tho other hand, it is very inadvisable to penult nny foreign power to take possession, oven tempo rarily, of tho custom houses of an American tepubllc lu order to enforce tho payment of Its obligations, for such temporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only es cape from these alternatives may at any tlmo bo that wo must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrange ment by which so much as possible of a just obligation shall bopald. To do so insures tho defaulting' re public from having to pay debt3 of au Improper character under duress, while it nlso insures honest creditors of tho republic from being passed by in tho interest of dishonest or grasping cred itors. Moreover, for the United States to tako such a position offers tho only possible way of Insuring us against a clash with somo foreign power. Tho position Is therefore In tho interest of peace ns well as lu tho interest of jus tice. Snuto DomliiKo. Santo Domlugo has now mndo an ap peal to us, and not only every principle of wisdom, but every generous Instinct within us, bids us respond to tho ap peal. Tho conditions lu Santo Domingo have for a number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago all society was on tho verge of dissolution. Fortunately just nt this tlmo a ruler sprung up In Santo Domlugo who, with his colleagues, saw tlio dangers threat ening thelr-country and appealed to tho friendship of tho only neighbor who possessed tho power and tho will to help them, Thero was Imminent dan ger of foreign intervention. Tho pa tlcnco of foreign creditors had becomo exhausted, and at least two foreign na tions wero on tho point of Intervention nnd wero only prevented by the unoffi- J clnl nssurauco of this government that It would itself strivo to help Santo Domingo In her hour of need. Accordingly, tho executlvo depart ment of our government negotiated a treaty under which wo aro trying to help tho Dominican pcoplo to straight en out their finances. This treaty Is pending beforo tlio senate. In tho Ueautlmo n temporary arrangement hns been made under which tho Domin ican government has appointed Amer icans to nil tho Important positions In tho customs service, and thoy nro see ing to tho honest collection of tho rov cuues, turning over 45 per cent to tho government for running expenses and putting tlio other C5 per cent Into n safe depositary for equitable division In caso tho treaty shall bo ratified among tho various creditors, whether European or American, Under tho courso taken stability and order nnd all tho benefits of peace nro nt last coming to Santo Domingo, dan ger of foreign Intervention has been suspended, nnd thero Is at Jast n pros poet that all creditors will got Justice, uu more una no less, it tno arrange- ment Is terminated by tlio failure of the treaty .chaos will follow, and sooner or later this government may bo In volved lu serious difficulties with for elgn governments over tho Island or elso ntny bo forced Itself to Intervene in tho Island In somo unpleasant fash Ion. Army nnd flfnry. I do not bellevo that any nrmy In tho world has a better average of enlisted man or n better typo of junior officer, but tho nrmy should bo trained to act effectively In n mass. Provision should bo mndo by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind. Provision Bhould bo made for tho pro motion of exceptionally meritorious men over the heads of their comrades nnd for tho retirement of all mqn who have reached n given ago without get ting beyond n given rank. Thero should bo nn increase In tho coast artillery force so that our coast fortifications can bo In somo degree adequately manned. Thero is special need for nn Increase and reorganization of the medical department of tho army. Iu both the army and navy there mti3t bo the sumo thorough training for duty In the staff corps as lu tho fighting Hue. The Importance of this was shown con clusively In tho Spanish-American nud tho Itusso-Japanoso wars. Tho work of the medical departments In tho .Inp nneso army and navy Is especially worthy of study. Our navy must, relatively to tho na vies of other tuitions, nlwnys bo of greater size than our army. Wo have most wisely continued for n number of years to build up our navy, nud It has now reached a fairly high standnrd of efficiency. This standnrd must not only bo maintained, but lncrensed. It does not seem to me necessary, how ever, that tho navy should, nt least in the Immediate future, bo increased be yond tho present number of units. What Is now clearly necessary Is to substitute efficient for Inefficient units as the latter become worn out or as It becomes apparent that they aro use less. Probably the result would bo attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year, tho superseded or outworn vessels being laid up or broken up ns they nro thus replaced. Naturalization. On this subject I recommend: First. A federal bureau of naturali zation, to bo established iu the depart ment of commerco nnd labor, to su pervise tho administration of tho nntu rallzatlou laws and to receive returns of naturalizations pending and accom plished. Second. Uniformity of naturalization certificates, fees to bo charged, and procedure. Third. Moro exacting qualifications for citizenship.. Fourth. Tho preliminary declaration of Intention to be abolished and no alien to be naturalized until at least ninety days after tho filing of his peti tion. Fifth. Jurisdiction to uaturallzo aliens to be confined to United States district courts and to such stato courts as have Jurisdiction In civil notions in which tho amount In controversy is un limited; in cities of over 100,000 Inhab itants tho United States district courts to havo exclusive jurisdiction lu the naturalization of the alien residents of such CltiCA Criminal I.uivh. In my Inst messngo I asked the at tention of tho congress to tho urgent need of notion to utako our criminal law more effective, and I most ear nestly request that you pay heed to tho report of tho attorney general on this subject. Thero seems to be no statute of the United Stntes which provides for tho punishment of a United States attor ney or jptlior officer of the government who corruptly ngrees to wrongfully do or, wrongfully refrain from doing nny net when tho consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than ono possesslug money value. This ought to bo remedied by npproprlato legislation. Legislation should also be enacted to cover explicitly, unequivocally nnd be yond question breneh of trust In tho shapo of prematurely divulging official secrets by au officer or employee of tho United Stntes nnd to provldo a suitable penalty therefor. Merchant Mnrlnc. To the spread of our trado iu peaco and tho defense of our flag in war n great and prosperous merchant marlno is Indispensable, We should havo bhlps of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets and In caso of need to rc-enforco our battlo line. It cannot but be a sourco of regret nnd uneasiness to us that tho lines of communication with our sister republics of South America should bo chiefly under foreign control. It Is not a good thing that American merchants nnd manufacturers should havo to send their goods and letters to South Amer ica vln Europe If they wish security and dispatch. Even on tho Pacific, Where our ships havo held their own better than on the Atlantic, our mer chant flag Is now threatened through the liberal aid bestowed by other gov ernments on their own steam lines. I ask your earnest consideration of tlio report with which tho merchant ma rino commission has followed Its long and careful inquiry. Jt is n matter of unmixed "satlsfac tion once moro to call attention to tho "stalled to enable us to rcsumo tho work excellent work of the pension bureau, of excavation on a largo scale, for tho veterans of tho civil war havo I What Is needed now nnd without do n greater claim upon us than any other lay Is nn appropriation by tho congress class of our citizens. To them first of , to meet tho current and accruing ex- all among our peoplo honor Is duo. Immigration. As I said in my Inst messngo to tho congress, wo cannot havo too much Immigration of tho right sort, and wo should havo nono whatever of tho wrong sort. Tho questions arising in connection with .Chlneso immigration stand bv themselves, Tho conditions in China nre such mat tho entire Chlneso cooly class that Is, the class of Chinese-' la-. borers, Bkllled and unskilled Iegitt mately come under the hcaxl of unde Blrablo Immigrants to thl country. But In tho effort to carry out tho pol icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi nese coolies, grave Injustice nnd wrong have been done by this nntlou to tlio people of China nud thereforo ultimate ly to this nation Itself. Chlucso stu dents, business nnd professional men of all kinds, not only merchants, but bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro fessors, travelers and tho like, should bo encouraged to conio here nnd treat ed on precisely the same footing that wo treat students, business meu, trav elers nnd tho llko of oilier nations. As a people wo havo talked much of tho oppn door In Chlnn, nnd wo expect) nud quite rightly Intend to Insist upou, justice being shown us by tho Chinese. But wo cannot expect to receive equity unless wo do equity. The Civil Service. Heads of executive departments and members of the commission havo coll ed my attention to the fact that tho rule requiring u filing of charges and three days' notice beforo nu employee could bo separated from tho service for Inefficiency has served no good pur pose whatever. Experience has shown that the rulo Is wholly Ineffective to save any man If u superior for Im proper reasons wlsbc3 to remove him and Is mischievous because it some times serves to keep In the service in competent liieit not guJlty of specific wrongdoing. Having these facts In view, the rule has been amended by providing that where tho inefficiency or Incapacity comes within the personnl knowledge of tho head of a department the removal may bo nittdo without no tice, tho reasons therefor being filed nnd made n record of tho department. The absolute right of removal rests where It always has rested, with tho head of a department. "Tho change Is merely ono of procedure. It was much nccdcdi and It In producing good re sults. . Our copyright laws need revision. Philippine nnd Other Islands. During tho lust year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering from tho series of disasters which slnco American occupation have greatly re duced tho amount of agricultural prod ucts below what was produced In Span ish times. The agricultural conditions of the Is lands enforce more strongly than ever tho argument In fnvor of reducing tho tariff on tho products of the riilllpplno Islands entering tho United Stntes. I earnestly recommend that tho tariff now Imposed by the Dlngley bill upon the products of tlio Phlllpplno Islands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff bo reduced to 2u per cent of tho present rates under the Dlngley act; that after July 1, 1000, tho tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced In tho Philippine Islands bo entirely removed nnd that freo trado between tho Islands nnd the United States In tho products of each country then bo provided for by law. In my judgment, Immediate steps should be taken for the fortification of Hawaii, This Is tho most Important point In the Pacific to fortify In order to conserve tho Interests of this coun try. It would bo hard to overstate the importance of this need. Ilnwali Is too heavily taxed. Laws should be enact ed sotting aside for n period of, say, twenty years 75 per cent of the Internal revenue and customs receipts from Ha waii as a bpcqlal fund to bo expeiided In tho Islands. I earnestly advocate tho adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Itlco. I wish nlso to call tho nttcntlou of tho congress to one question which af fects our insular possessions generally namely, the need of an Increased lib erality" In the treatment of tho whole franchise question hi these Islands. I earnestly ask that Alaska bo given nn elective delegate. Admission to Statehood. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted as ono stato and that Now Mexico and Arizona bo admitted as ono state. The Punumit Cannl. Active work hi canal construction, mainly preparatory, has been lu prog ress for less than a year aud a half. During that period two points about tho canal have ceased to he open to debate, First, the question of routo; Bocoud, tho question of feasibility. Tho point which reinalus unsettled Is wheth er the canal shall bo one of several locks above sea, level or at sea level with a slnglo tide lock. On this point 'I hope to lay beforo tho congress at au earljvday tho findings of tho advisory board of American and European en gineers. In addition to sanitating tho Isthmus, satisfactory quarters aro being provid ed for employees nnd an adequate sys tem of supplying them with wholesome 1 food nt reasonable prices has been cre ated. Hospitals havo bccit established nud equipped that nro without superi ors of their kind unywhere. Durlug tho past year a largo portion of tho plant with which the work Is to bo fiono has been ordered. It Is confident ly believed that by tho mlddlo of tho approaching year n sufficient propor,- tlon of this plant will havo becu in- ppnses of tho commission. Tho first appropriation of $10,000,000 out of tho $133,000,000 authorized by the Spooncr net was made three years ago, It h nearly exhausted.

The Very Select, On account of the bargain season that comes with tho approach of tho holidays New York's Four Hundred has been marked down to seventy-nine. Tills greatly simplifies matters. If there are only soventy-nlno persons lu town worth knowing, tho visitor from the rural districts should have no trou ble In getting ncquulntcd with all of them lu n few days that Is, provided ho could get near enough.
