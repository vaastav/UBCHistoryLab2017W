In the negotiulioaJJiua openeUaadstUl pending there, the United States only claimed that for thefuture the lights secured to their citizens bv treaty shoul be respected in. Cuba, ana mat as to Uie, past a joint trib unal Should be established in Hip United states with full jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case which at one time threatened seriously to affect the relations between the United States and Spain has'already been ilrsposed of in this way. The claim-of the Lloyd-4pinwall, tor the illegal sei zure and detention of that vessel, was referred to arbitration, by mu tual consent and has resulted in an award to the United States, for the owners of the same of 19,702 50 in gold. u " Another arid long pending claim of like nature, that of the whalesbip Canada,' has been " disposed of by friendly arbitration during the pres ent year. , "It was referred. " by the joint consent of Brazil and the Uni ted States, to the decision of Sir Edward ' Thornton, her Britannic Majesties Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testi mony submitted by the two govern ments, and showed there was due to the United States the sum of one hundred thousand seven hundred and forty dollars and nine cents, in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial government5 These recent exam pies show that the mode which the United States have pro posed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible, and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay. - Should the pending negotiations unfortunately and unexpectedly be without result, it will then become my duty to com municate that fact to Congress and invite its action on the subject -' t The long deferred peace confer ence between Spain and the allied South American republics has 'been inaugurated in Washington nnder the auspices of the Uuited States. Pursuant to the recommennatia .s contained in the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December, 1866, the Executive Department of the govern mett of-1 fered its friendly Offices for the pro-J motion of peace arid harmony be tween Spain and the allied republic! Hesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance of the offer. T Ul timately, however, a conference was arranged, and was opened in this city on the 29th of October last, at wnicu I authorized the Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili and Ecuador. In consequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia, the conference-was adjourn ed until the attendance of a plenipo tentiary from that republic could be secured or other measures could, be adopted toward compassing its ob ject The allied and other republics of Spanish origin on this continent may see in this fact anew proof of our sincere interest in their welfare ; our desire to see them blessed, with good governments, capable of main taining order and preserving th;ir respective territorial integritv,and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relations with them. The time is probably not far distant when, in the natural course of events, . the European political connection with this continent will cease.. ! Our policy should be shaped in view ot this probability, so as to ally the commercial interests of the Spanish American States more close to to our own, and thus give the United States all the preeminence and all the advantage which Mr. MonrOe, Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay contemplated when thev proposed to join to the Congress of Panama. jjunng tne last session ot Con gress a treaty for the annexation of the republic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the requisite two thirds vote of tie Sen-: ate. I was thoroughly convinced then ihat the best interests of the country, commercially and materi ally,, demanded its ratification. Time has only confirmed me in this view. I now firmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States have entirely abandom the project of accepting as a part of its territory the island of San Domingo, airee port will be negotiated for by European nations. In the bay of Samana a large commercial city will spring up, to which we will be tributary without receiving "corres ponding benefits . The folly, of our rejection haa aggrieved the govern ment of San' Domingo, which volun tarily sought, this annexation. It is a weak power, numbering probably less than one hundred and twenty thousand souls and yet possessing one of ( the richest localities under the sun.capable of supporting a pop ulation often millions of people in luxury, The people of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining them selves in their present condition and must look for outside support They yearn for the protection of our free institutions and laws, our progress and civilization. Shall we refuse them ? The acquisition of San Do mingo is desirable, because of its geographicarposition. It commands the entrance to the Caribbean sea and the Isthmus transit' of -com merce; possesses tha richest soil,. best and-moss - sapactoas - ftarjiftra., most : salubrious liin ate and the most valuable products ot tne foresi.mine jand soil pi anyof the Wet India U: lands,-ItS"p-6s8e8sion by tha United States will, in a few years, build up a costwise commerce of immense magnitude which will go far toward restoring to na our merchant marine It will give.; to ' tis , those articles whicb we consider greatly and do not produce, thus equalizing our ex ports and incporls. In case of for eign war it will give us command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an eneraylfrom a?ain pos sessing himself of a rendezvous up on our coast It protects our coast trade between the States ;"borderinff on tha Atlantio and thosa-borderinir on me unit or Mexico. Wow, as to the. Bahamas and. the Antilles, twice we must, as it were, have passed through foreign countries to get from Georgia to the west ooast of Florida.' I u- ; : - San Domingo, with a stable gov ernment under which her immense resources can be developed, will 1 give remunerative wages to ten! thousand of laborers not now upon tne island. I nis labor will take ad vantage of every available means of transportation to abandon the ad jacent islands and seek the blessings of freedom and its sequence,' each inhabitant receiving the rewards of his own labor. Porto Rico and Cu ba will have to abolish slavery as a measure of self-preservation to re tain their labor. Sau Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern farms and manufactories. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food to the island, and machin ery, will make it necessarV that con tiguous islands should have the same4 advantages in order to compete with the production of sugar, coffee, to bacco, tropical fruit fec. This will open to us a wider market for our products. The production of our owu supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our ' auuual imports, besides in creasing our exports. . W ith such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad! is ultimately to be extinguished. With a balance of trade against us, including the inter est of the bonds held b3' foreigners, and money shipments of our citizeas traveling in foreign lands, equal to the entire yield of precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this result is to" be otherwise accomplished. The acquisition of San Domingo is an adhesion to the Monroe doctrine. It is a measure of protection. It is asserting our just claim to a controling influence over, tue great commercial t raffle soon to flow from the West to the Eest, by way of the Isthmus of Dar ien. It is to build our merchant ma; ine. It is to furnish new mar kets for the products of our farms, shops and manufactories. It is to make slavery insupportable in Cuba and Porto Rioc at once, and ulti mately so in Brazil. It is to settle the unhapy condittion of Cnba, and end an exterminating conflict It is to provide honest means of paj ing our honest debts without tax ing the people.' It is to furnish "our citizens with the necessaries of eve ry day life st cheaper rates thanrev er before.and is.in fine.a rapid stride toward that greatness whice the in telligence, industry, and enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle the country to assume among the nations. In view of the impor tance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Congress early action ex pressive of its views as to the best means of acquiring San Domingo. My stigestion is that by a joint reso lution of the two Houses of Con gress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to nego tiate for a treaty with the authori ties of San Domingo for the acqui sition of that island, ami that an ap propriation be made to defray the expenses of such commission. The question may then be determined by the action of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of an nexation, as in the acquisition of Texas. So convinced am I of the advantages to flow from the acquisi tion of San Domingo and of the great disadvantages. I might almost say calamities, to flow from non-acquisition, that I believe the subject has only to be investigated to be approved. It is to be regretted that our rep resentations in regard to the injur ious effects, especially upon the revenues of the United States, of the policy of the Mexican government in exempting from import duties a large tract of its territory on our borders, have not only been fruit less, but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilege adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed. The exepdiency of taking into your ser ious . consideration proper means for countervailing the policy ref red to will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention. : It is the obvious interest, espec ially of neighboring nations, to pro vide against injury to those who may have committed high crimes within their borders, and who may have sought refuge abroad for this purpose. Extradition treaties have been concluded with several of the Central : American republics, and others are in progress. The sense of Congress is desired as early as may be convenient, upon the pro ceedings of the Commission on Claims aganst Venezuela, as com municated in the messages of March 4 , 1869 ; March 1, 1870, and March 31, 1870. It has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been received from that government until Congress shall have acted upon the subject. The massacres ot French and Russian residents ' at " Tien-Tsin, under circumstances of great bar barity, were supposed by some to have been premeditated, and to in dicate a purpose among the Chinese empire. The evidenu fails to es tablish suce a supposition, but show s a complicty by the local authorities and the mob. ' The government at Perkin, however, seems to have been disposed to fulfill its treaty obliga tions so far as it was able to do so. Unfortunately the news of the war between the German "! States and Fringe reached, 0,bjn,a s.qon, after the massacre. r Jt appear Jh,at the. popular " mind -became possessed with the idea that this contest, ex- tendingtoChfnese waters,"' would neutralize the Chris tan influence and power, and that the time was com ing: when the superstitions mass might expel all . foreigners and re store mandarian influence. Antici pating trouble - from this cause, I invited France and North Germany to niake an authorized : suspention of hostilities in the East; where they were temporarily suspended by act of tbetoramanders,' to act together for the future protection in China of the lives and property of Ameri cans add Europeans. '? 7 fi;-.jj .Siuee.ljic,, adjournment of Con. gresa the ratifications of the treaty with Great Britan, for abolishing the mixed Courts for the suppression of the slave trade," have been ' recog nized ; It is believed thaclhe slave trade is now confined to tne eastern coast of Africa, where the slaver are taken to Arabian markets. ' ' The ratification of the naturaliza tion' convention between Great Britain and the United Stater have also been exchanged during the re cess, and thus a long' standing dis pute between the governments heen settled in accordance with principles contended . for by has the the united stales. t In April last, when engaged in lo cating a military reservation near Pembina, a corps of engineers dis covered that the commonly received boundary line between the United! States and British possessions at that place is about fifty-seven hun dred feet south of the true position of the zenith parallel, and that the line, when run on what is cow sup posed to be the true position of that parallel, would leave the fort of the Hudson Bay Company at Pembina within the territory of the United States. This iufoimation being communicated to the British gov ern-aent I was requested to con sent, and I did consdnt that the Britifh occupation of the fort of the Hudson Bay Company should continue for the present. I deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary line should be defi nitely fixed by a joint commission of the government, and ' submit therewith estimates of the expenses of such a commission on the part of the United States, and recommend an appropriation for that purpose. The land boundary is already fixed and marked from the summit of the Rocky Mountain to the Georgian Bay. It should now be in like man ner marked from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains."""!"" I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted uy that government during the re bellion. The Cabinet of London, so far as its views have been ex pressed, does not appeal to be wil ling to concede that her Majesty's government was guilty of negligence, or did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has cause of complaint Our firm and unalterable convictions are di rectly the reverse, and therefore I recommend to Congress to author ize the appointment of a com mis sioa to take proof of the amounts and the ownership of their claims on notice to the representatives .of her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given for the pur chase of these claims by the United States, so that the government shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the responsible control of all the claims against Great Britain. It can not be neces sary to add that whenever her Maj esty's government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjust ment of these claims, the United States will enter upou their consid eration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. The course pursued by the Cana dian authorities toward the fisher men of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a frierdly feeling. By the first arti cle of the convention of 1818, be tween Great Britain and the United Slates should have forever, in com mon with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain waters there in defined. In the waters not in eluded in the limits named in the convention were those within three miles of ports of the British coast. it nas oeea, tue custom tor many years to give to intruding flsher men of the United States a reason able warning of their violation of the technical rights of Great Britain The Imperial government is under stood to have delegated the whole or a snare or its jurisdiction or con trol of these inshore fishery grounds to the Colonial authority, kuowu as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Ves sels have been seized without notice or warning, in violation of the cus tom previously prevailing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up, and the vessels condemaed. There is rea son to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was de signed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the Uuited States, with a view to political effect upon the government The officers of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They authorize ofli cers or persons to bring vessels ho vering within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of Canada into port to search the cargo, and examine the master, on oath, touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him heavy pecuniary penalty if a true answer were not given ; and if such a vessel is found preparing to fish within three marine miles of any such coasts, bays, creeks or harbors, without a license, or after the expi ration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they pro vide that the vessel with her tackle, ic , shall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations have been made nnder this statute: Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become neces sary to protect the rights of the citi seqs Qft'be Un ited, states. It has been cjaiincd. bj' fter Majesty's 0"1- In Aprl'lasthennggd1nhighwaTa orThancls opened by -Ti- iuvhuii n military reservation near cers that the fishing vessels of the United States have no right to enter the open orts of the British posses sions in North America, except for .the purposes of shelter and repair ing damages, purchasing wood and obtaining. water; that they have no ngiit to inter at tne British Custom Houses, or to trade, except the pur chase of wood and water, aud that they must depart within twenty four hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a fishing "vessel carryiug the flag of I tne United states has been made nnder this claim. So far as the claim- is founded on an alleged con struction of the convention of 1818, it can not be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped that it will not bo insisted on by her Maj esty's government During the conference which preceded the ne gotiation of the convention of 1818 the British Commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the United States from the privi lege of carrying on trade with any Of his Britannic Majesty's subjects residing within the limits assigned for their use, and also that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States, engaged . in such fishing, to have on board any goods, wares or merchandise whatever, ex cept such as may be necessary for the prosecution of their voyages to and from said fishing grounds, and any vessel of the United States, which shall contravene this regula tion, may be seized, condemned and confiscated, with their cargoes. This proposition, which is identical with the construction now put upon the language of the convention, was emphatically rejected by the Ameri can coxmissioners, aiid thereupon was abandoned by the British pleni potentiaries, and Article 1, as it stands in the convention, was sub stituted. If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on pro vincial or colonial statistics and not upon the convention, this govern ment can not but regard them as un. friendly, and in contravention ot the faithful execution of which the Imperial government is alone responsible. Anticipating that an attempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authoritis in the com ing season to repeat these unneigh borly acts toward our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend by proclamation the operations of the laws authorizing the transit ' ot goods, wares and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United States to Canada ; and fur ther, should such an extreme mea sure become necessary, to suspend the operations of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of Can ada are permitted to euter the wa ters of the United States. A like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on the prrt of Can ada, in the maintainance of a claim of right to exclude t.e citizens of the United Stales from the naviga tion of the St Lawrence. The riv er constitutes a natural outlet of the lakes to the ocean, with an aggre gate population of about 17,600,000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of 661,367 Ions upon the waters which disrharge into it The foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to British com petition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the American seamen be excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, the monopoly of the direct commerce of the lake po:ts with the Atlantic would be in foreign lianas, their vessels on trans-Atlantic voyages having an access to our lake ports, which would be denied to American vessels on similar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice. During the administra tion of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay unquestionably demon strates the natural right of the citi zens of the United States to the navigation of the river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vi enna, in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgment of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river to and into the sea, even thongh pass ing through the territory of another power. This right does not include the coequal right of the sovereign possessing the territory through which the river touches in the sea to make such regulations relative to the policy of the navigation as may be really necessary, but these regu lations should be framed in a liberal spirit or comity, and should not impose needless burdens upon the the commerce which has the right of transit It has been found in practice more advantageous to ar range these requirements by mutual agreement - The United states are ready to make any reasonable arrangement as to the police of the St Lawrence which may be suggested by Great Britain If the claim By Mr. Clay just when the population of the States bordering on the shores of the lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives greater force and equity from the increased population, wealth production and tonage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argumect in be half ot our rights, the principle fr which he coutended has been fre quently and by various nations rec ognized by law or by treaty, has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence, 1831, the Rhine - was de clared free from the point where it is first .navigable i;i to the sea. By the convention between Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1835, the navigation of the Dours throughout its whole extent was made free for the subjects of both crowns. In 1853 the Argentine confederation by treaty threw open the free naviga tion of the Parana and Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of .the Danube. In 1858. Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it regarded the rivers, Amizon and La Plata, in accordance with tho fixed prppiples Qf natural Jaw, as ture for the comerce of all nation? In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in Deoember, 1866, the Emperor of Brazil, by Imperial decree, declared the'Amaaon and to be open to all the fnontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authori ty on this subject, while asserting the abstract right of the British claim, says it seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law, that is equal ly difficult to deny. , I-.That .in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law. 2. That her conduct with res pect to (he navigation of the St Lawrence is in glaring and dUcred itable inconsistency with the conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi, on the ground that she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took i s rise. She insisted on this right to navigate the entire volume of its waters, on . the ground the ground that she possess ed both banks of the St. Lawrence, where it disembouges itself into the sea. She denies to the United States the right r of navigation through about half of the waters of lakes On tario, Erie, Huron and Superior.and superior, and the whole . of lake Michigan, through which the river flows, are the property of the United States, the whole nation is interest ed in securing a cheap transporta tion from the agricultural States of tne w est to tne Atlantic sea board. To the citizens hf those States, it secures a greater return for their la bor to the inhabitants of the sea board, it offers cheaper fcod ; to the nation an increase in the annual sur plus of wealth. It is hoped that the the Government of.Gre:t Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which to which her Canadian provinces have urged her adherence. Our depressed commerce is a sub ject to which I called yocr special attention at the last session. It is suggested that we will in the fuiure have to look more to-the- countries south of us, and to China and Japan, for its reviyaL Our representatives to all these governments have ex erted their influence to encourage trade between the United States aud the countries to which they are ac credited ; but the fact exists, that the carrying is done almost eulirelv in foreign bottoms; ana while this state of affairs exists, we cannot control our due share of the com merce of the world. That between the pacific states and China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conducted in American vessels I would recommend a liberal pol icy towards that lino of American steamers one mat will insure sue cesses and increased usefulness. The cost of building iron vessels the only ones that can comp.te with for eign snips in the enrrvin trade U so mucb greater in the Lnited States than in foreign couutries, that without some assistance from the government tuejr cannot be successfully built here. There will be several propositions laid before Congress in the course of the p res.se nt session, looking to a rem edy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the Natiomd Treasury. 1 hope nch cnccumjreiueut will be giv en a will secure the American ship building at home. . The condition of the architects at the Department of State, calls for the early action ot Congress. The building now rented by that department, is frail structure,at inconvenient distance from the Executive Mausion. and from the other Departments. It is all adapted to the purpose for which it is used, has not capacity to accommodate the ar chives, and it is not tire-proof. Its re mote situation, its sleudcr construction and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood, leaves but little hope of snfety for either the building or its contents in case of the accident of a Are. Its destruction would involve the loss the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress, of the his tory and records of Ihe revolution ; and ot the confederation of the whole servi ces ot diplomatic aud consular archives since the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many other valuable records nd papers left with that department when it was the principal depository of the Government archives. I recom mend an appropriation for the con struction of a building for the Depart ment of State. j I rtcofnmontl to roar recontiderattoa the Pro- ?ricty of trantferfinir to the Department of Ihe ntriior, to which they aeem mora awpropri atety to beloiift, all powers and daiirs la relation to the Territories, with which the dep ytmcnt if Slate Unow charged by law or nsage; and from the Interior Department to the War Deniartinent the Pension Bureau, ao far as it refrnUtea the payment of aoMiem penaiona.

In this estimate, however Is included (22, 338.178.37 for public work bernt'ifore begun an ker Congressional proriaiona, of which only ao much is asken as Congrress may chooae to gire. The appropriation for the same work, for the present tlscal year, was Sll.a.4,518,63. The average value of rold, as compared with the national currency, for toe whole ot the year 1840, wao about 134 ; and for eleven mouths of 1S7U, the 8 ime relative value ia about 115. The approach ta a specie haaia ia very irraiifying. but tie fa.t cannot be denied that the inabilities of the value of our national currency ia pryjaritcial to our prosperity, and tends to koep up price, to the detriment ol trade. Tne evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency are ao (Treat that now, when the premium on gold ha fallen so much, b would aeem that the time ha arrived when, by wiae and prudent legislation. Con ires should look to a policy which would place our currency at par with gold, at no distant day. The lax col lected from tbe people haa beon reduced more tbaneifrhty million dollars per annum By stead iness in our present course, there is no reason why in a few abort years, tbe national tax-gatherer may not disappear from tho door of tbe citizen al most entirely ; with the revenue stamp dispensed by post-masters in every community ; a tax upon liquors of til sorts, and tobacco in all forms; and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty only upon those articles which we could dispeuso with, known as luxuries, and on those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be raised, after a few years of peace and consequent reduction o( indebtedness, to fulfill all our obliga tions. ) " A further reduction of expenses, in addittioa to a reduction of inter est account, may be relied on to make this practicable. . Revenue reform, if it means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for tbe support of the Government, for the payment ot the principle and interest of the pubile debt, pensions; feo, by directly taxing the people, then I am against revenue reform, and confidently believe, the people with me. ' If it means failure to pro duce the necessary means to defray the expenses of tbe Government,and then by. repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed to such kind of rev enue reform. - .Revenue reform has not been de Qnei by any of its advents, to raj knowledge, bnt seems to he aooept- ed as something which, ja to supply j eitery man's wants," without ang cost or effort on his part. A true revenue reform cannot be made in a vday, but must be tht work of national legislation, and ol tlmcT As soon as the revenue can be dispensed with, all duty should be removed from coffe, tea, and other articles of universal use, not produced by ourselves. The ne cessities of the country compel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of Collectors and Asses sors is not a pleasant sight to the citizens; but that, or a tariff for rev enue, is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it acts in encouragement to home products, affords employ ment to labor at living wages, in contrast to pauper labor of the Old World, and also in the development of home resources.: Under the act of Congress. Under the act of Congress, of the 18th day of July, 1879, tne army ua oeea graauauy re duced, and on the 1st of January, 1871, tbo number of commissioned officer ana men will not exceed tbe number contemulated bv law. The War lepartmeut building is an old struo- tuie, not nru-prooi. ana entirety inadequate inaimension to our present want, jaanr thousands of dollars are now paid annually for rent of private buildings to accommodate the various bureau of the department. I re commend an appropriation for a new War Department building suited to the present sou growing wants oi tno nation, xae report of tlie Secretary of Wat shows a very satisfac tory reduction in the expense of the army for tbe last fiscal year, for detail you are referred to his accomoanvina rcuort. Tbe expenses of tbe navy for the whole of the last year, from December. lSeu, the date of tne last report, are less tnan nineteen million dollars, or about cse million les than they were the previous year. Tbe expense of the vy Department la this ascal year, since July 1st. show fortbeflva months a decrease ol over f,4UU,0UQ from those of tbe correspond ing montns of last year. The estimate for tue current year were tii.2O5.e70: those for the next year are f20,6t3,3i7, with f'JSl.OUU addi tional for temporary and permauent improve ment. . ia, . appropriation maae lor tne last aud current tear were evidently intended by congress, and are sufficient only, t keep the navy on its present footing, and tbe repairing and red. ting of our old snips. This policy must, of course, gradually but sorely destroy tbe navy, and it is. in itself, far ftvm economi-cal--lor cab year that it is parsued tbe neces sity for more repairs ia ship aud -navy yards become more imperative and more costly; and oar current expenses are actually increased for tbe mere repair of shlpt, many of which must soon be nnsea worthy and useless. 1 bope during the present year and session of Con. grew to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval vessel can be built and repairs made with great saving upon tbe present cost. It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a gov ernment which represents a country with over tfve thousand miles. of coast line on both oceans. exclusive of Alaska, and containing a.law.gssiwf pi- a, restive people, with relations of even nature with almost every loreism country, so reat with such inadequate meansuf torciug any foreign policy eitner ot protection or re Ureas. Separated by tbe ocean from the nations of tbe ' astern continent, our navy is ourouly means of direct protection to our citi xens abroad, or for the enforcement of our foreign policy. The accouioanvinz renort of the Postmaatjr General sbows a most satisfactory working of that dep irtinent. With the adoption ot tbe recommendations Contained theirin. nartlcu- larly the legislating to a reform in the frank ing privilege, anu tne auoption or a coma pouaence cards, a seif-sustuining postal svs turn may be speedily looked fi r, anu at no ilis tant day a further reduction of tba rale of postage can be attaiued. 1 recommend the authorization by Congress to tbe Postmaatea General and Attorney General to issue ail couiuiissions, wnere appointments are made, are issued br tha eilate Ifeuartment. - The law in all tne departments of goverumeut, except those of the Fostolhee and of Justice, author ize each to issue its own commissions. Always favoring practical reforms. I re spectfully call your atsention to one abuse of long stanaiag, wnien i wouiu use to see rem etlied by tiiis congress. It is a reform in the civil service of tbe country. I would advise it to go beyond the mire fixing or tne tenure-of-Olhceot clerkaaud employes, who do not re quire the advice and cousent or tbe Senate to make up the appointments complete. 1 would have it govern, not the tenure only, but the manner of making all appointment. There is no .duty wbicb so mucn embarrasses tbe Executive and heads of Ueparments as that ui appoiutments. nor is there any such arduous aud tauutkreas labor imaosed on senators auu Representatives as thatoi ttuuing places for sMusiiiucucs. las pnsaeus system uoes tot secure me brst saeu. and often not even nt area for public place. The elevation ana pur IScaitun of tbe civil service of tbe govern ment will be baited with, approval uy the whole people or tue Coiled States. Meionu lu tbe maaagement of Indian affairs haarve.-ivei the apeeial attention ot tbe ad ntiaisira.ioj from its inauguration to tne present nay. Tne experiment Was tried ol a.iuj it a miionary agency, given to the deuouiin.uiouot friends, and has been found ! work must advantageoasl. All the ageu eies audsu,eriiitendeuctes not so disposed of w ere gl veu to oilicers ot tb army, t'ne act of Congress reducing the army renders army oincers ineligible for civil poaitious. Jmiiau agencies being eivil oalces, 1 determined to gi e nil tne agencies to such religious denom inations as Lad heretofore established mis idouuries among tue I mii ens, and perhaps to seme other denomination v. ho would under take ih i worn ou the same terms as a mission ary work . - ' The societies selected are allowed to ratne their own agents, subject to the approval of tbe Executive, and are expected to watch over tbem and aid them as mssslonaries and Christian, aud civilize the Indian, and to train him in the arts of peace. The govern ment watches over the omcial arts of these agauts, and requires of the. u as strict an ac count of their ability as if they were appoint ed iu any manner. I entertain the eonndeut hope that the policy now pursued will in a few j s irs bring all the Indian apsn reserva tion where they will live ia honses, have school houses and churcnes. will be pursuing peaceful and self-sustaining avocations, and where they may be visited by the law-abidiug white man w ith the same inpunity that he now t Uits the civ Uzed white settlements- I call yoursuejial attention to the repjrt of the C'ommiosioner of Indian Affair for full in formation on this subject, .' During the past fiscal year 809,541, 300 acres ot public land were disposed of. Of this quantity 36li.891.000 acres were taken under the bomeetend law, and 215.951. 581 sold for cash. The re mainder was located by military war rants, college or Ihdian scrip, or ap plied in satisfaction of "rants to mil roads, or for other public uses. Tbe entries nnder the Homestead law dur ing the past year covered 961,545 acres inorv than those during the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously prosecuted to the full extent of the means applicable to the purpose, and the quantity of land in tho market will amply supply the present demand. The claim ofliose settled nnder the Home stead or Preemption laws is not, how ever, limited to lands subject to sale at private entry. Any appropriated sur veyed public land may, to a limited amount, be acquired under the former laws, if the party entitled to enter un der them will comply with the require ments they prescribe in regard to resi dence and cultivation. The actual set tler's preference or rijrht if purchase U even broader, and extends to lands which were unsurveyed at the time of hia settlement. His right was former ly con lined within much narrower lim its, and at one period ot our history was conferred only by special statutes. They were enacted from time to time to legalize what was regarded as an unauthorized intrusion upon the na tional domain. The opinion that the public lands should be regarded chietly as a source of revenue is no longer maintained. The rapid settlement aud successful cultivation of them is now justly considered of more importance to our well be in, than is ihe fund which the sale of them would produce. The remarkable growth and prosperity of our States and Territories attest the wisdom cf the legislation which invites the tiller of the soil to secure a perma nent home on terms within the reach of all. The pioneer, who incurs the dangers and privations of a frontier life, and thus aids In laying the foun dation ot a new commonwealth, ren ders a signal service to his country, and is entitled to its special favor and pro tection. Tbe laws secure that object, and largely promote the general wel fare. They should, therefore, be cher ished as a permanent feature of our laud system. Good faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. The time-honored and beniticent policy of setting apart certain sections of the public land for educational purj oses in the new States should be continued. When ample provision shall have been made for these objects, I submit, as a question worthy of serious cocsidera tion. whether the residue of our nation al domain shou.14 not be wholly dispos ed of under the provisions of the Home stead an,d Preempt (on laws. In addi tion to (be swamp and oversowed lads granted to the State in which they are situated, the lands tagen under the Agricultural College acts and lor in ternal improvements or improvement i-prpoes under the -act fSeptetnber. 1641, and the acta supplemental there to, mere nao Deen conveyed -up to tba close of the last fiscal year," by 'patent ol other equivalent evidence of title, to States and corporations, 3,783,257 -and 13-100 ac.es for: railways, canals and wagon roads. It Is estimated that am additional quantity of 174,735,523 acres is st'll due under grants for like ne. The policy of thus aiding the States la building works of internal improve ment was inaugurated more than forty years since ou the grants to Indians and Illinois on the opening of the ca nals to connect the waters of tbe Wa bash with those of Lake Erie, and those of the Illinois with those of Lake Mich igan It was followed, with some mod ideation, in. the grant of Illinois of al ternate sections of Dtibltc lands within certain limits of tue miaow Central Bailway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations - have received, similar subsidies in connection with railways oom pitted or in process of construc tion. As the reserved sections ace ra ted as double the minimum price the sale of them on them on tbe ' enhanced prices Las thus, ia manv instances, in- 'demnitied the Treasury tor the granted J lands. The construction of same of I these thoroughfares has undoubtedly given vigvimto uupchus w uiouevcivp- . inenr oi our resources, ana tne settle jmentof the more distant portiodg of me country. is way, uuwn er.ue weu insisted that much of our legislation in this regard has bees characterized by indiscriminate and profuse ftberality. The United States should not. loan their credit in- aid of any 'enterprise undertaken by States or corporations nnless the projected works are of ac knowledged material importance. I am strongly inclined to tbe opinion that is inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow subsidies of either description, but should Congress determine other wise, I earnestly recommend that the rights of settlers and of the pn bile be more effectually secured, and bV ap propriate legislation. During the year ending September 20, 137a there were filed in tbe Patent Office 17.411 applications lor patents ; 3.374 caveats, and 160 applications for the extension of patents f-13,622 patents including reissues and designs 'were issued. 101 extended. 1,080 allowed, but not issued by reason of the nonpay ment of the tlnal fees; The receipts of the office during the fiscal year were $137,304 29 in excess ot its expendi tures. ..., The work of the Census Bureau has been energetically prosecuted.- The preliminary report, containing inncb information of special value and Inter est, will be ready for delivery during the present session. The remaining;, volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent with perfect accu racy in arranging and classifying the return. We shall thus at no distant day be furnished with an authentic record of our condition and resources. It will, I doubt not. attest the growing prosperity of the country, although during the decade which has just elosed it wis so severely tried by the great., war waged 'to maintain its Integrity, . and to secure and perpetuate our free institutions. - ' ' During the last fiscal year the sum -paid to pensioners, including tbe ,cost ol disbursement. was$27,7SO.tsll 11," and 1,753 bounty land warrants were issued. At its close 193,6x5 names were on "the pension rolls. The labors of tbe Pen sion Office have been directed to a -se-'" -vere scrutiny of the eridenee ouui it ted in favor of lawful claims, and to the discovery of rk-tltious claims which have been here tore allowed. The 'ap propriation fjr the employment of spe cial agents for the investigation of fn.uds have been judiciously used, and the results obtained have been of un questionable benefit to the service. The subjects ol education and agri culture are of great interest ta tha sue cjss of our republican institutions, h tppiness, and grandeur as a nation.. I n tne interest of-one a bureau has been, established in the Interior Dep.irtmebt . tbe Bureau of Education, and in the in teres i of the other, a separate Depart ment, that of Agriculture. I believe great general good ia to follow from-" the operations ot both these bureau?; if v properly fostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration too high ly the teports of the Commlssiwners of Education and of Agriculture, nor urge, too strongly such liberal legislation to secure their efficiency. 1 " In conclusion, I would sum op tbe policy of the ad mm is rattan to be a therouith en forcement of every law.
