The plant employee about forty-live skilled workmen, most ol wh'om are jttich mond men and have wives and en.?dren dependent on them. "Mr. "Whitehurst informed a Times writ? er, when the lire had hardly been gotten under control, that he certainly lntv.?ueu to rebuild at once. The origin of the fire is unknown. It had been ourning at least ten minutes before- the first alarm was turnen in. Tiie fire was fought by the entire De? partment, under the direction of Assist? ant-Chief Shaw, Chief Puller being sick. The firemen did line work. The first alarm was sent to the De? partment at 12:21. It was 'phoned to tne central office by Mr. \V. C. Cur'toy, who is employed in ?...e yards of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, just in the rear of the Byrd-Street depot. The firemen had control of the flames by 1 o'clock, it was hours later than this before the engines were able to leave the scene. The firemen met with great difficulty in fretting pressure of water for the engines. The steam pressure was excellent all the time, but firemen said that No. 5 engine had almost as we'l have been at its sta? tion. *o small ?was the pressure of water that could be obtained. The property destroyed consisted of the factory and machinery room of Uie plant, the dryer, containing 40,030 feet of lum? ber, as well as thousands of feet of lum 1>-*:? slacked up in the yard in the rear Ot the machine room. Many of the work? men had tools of their own in this room. Those were all destroyed. The offie?? and storeroom of the plant and the stables, with three horses and quito a ? p I--4"? ? quantity of lumber, were among the perishables that were saved. AVAS KAS Y OF ACCESS. Th?: fire was in a building that offered line opportunities for the firemen' to light it with casse. It was but two stories liigh and much of the fiercest llames Avere in the lumber yard and scarcely tea feet from the ground. But the flames had gotten such a headway before the alarm was sent In. The response was prompt, however, and several streams wer?? soon playing on the half smothered flames. A part of tho time, even after the fire was tinder control, from a spec? tacular standpoint, the lire was a very pretty one. Mr. XV. C. Curby. of tlic Atlantic Coast Line road, said he looked out of the little yard house about 32:20. The lumber in the rear of the yard of the Whitehurst plant was then in a bright blaze. lie 'phoned that fact to the fire alarm ofl?ce. H?; then came down t?> the fire and found that the machine room was also burning. It w;ls evident to him that the fire had started in the ?umber yard first. As soon as Assistant Chii i Shaw reach- ; ed the scene, he sent in the second alarm. ? The three sixes followed. All the ma? chines of tho city responded to this ox < ??: N\?. t'. and Truck Xo. 3. These coirne to the headquarters as a reserve. SOME HAD GOOD PRESSURE. The great problem confronting the fire? men was to get water. Engines Nos. 1 and 2 were slopped on the bridge across the ?anal at Xinth Street. These got fine pressure and their streams were strong all the time. Xo. 8 had to dig a hole in the mud of the canal to get iu* suction pipe in. At first its pressure was very poor. Xo. 4 was at Xinth and (""anal Streets, and did line work. Xo. 7 tit hardly any time?? had more than 3? pounds of pressure, and did very little service. This was the best that could be done, too. so it was said. The water was not to be had. Xo. 5 had good pressure and ?sent in a fine stream. One factor of the fire, which rather aided the firemen in the end than hindered them, was the strong win?" blowing from the north. Thi*-. kept the l "ne*? from the office building. The impression of every one who reached th?? fire in its earlier stages was that it had originated in the lumber yard. Mr. Whitehurst saia he could net explain it <xcept that it was the careless work of tramps who were seeking shelter from the wind and col?1.. Mr. John X Browning, the foreman of the plant, was also of this opinion. They both said th: t there was nothing in the machine room likely to cause a fire. The crowd was not a very large one. probably one th?*>usand people, and many of these had gotten out of bed to cerne. About a half do*&en ladVs also looked on. Mr. Whit?hv.rst was at his home asleep. He was called up by Sergeant Brooks nnd told of the destruction of his plant; He came at once. He was very calm. This is th?* second, possibly the third, lire tsc has had. THE FIRST ALARM. The first alarm came iu the shape of ? telephone message C?jm the Atlantic Coa?"t Line train dispatcher at 12:21 C o'cloek. Engine Xo. 7 responded. Two minutes later box li, at the ?.orner of Tenth and Byrd Streets, was turned In at 32:23. A second alarm was sent in at 32:26, and at 12:04 Chief snaw turned in the thre sinxes, and ail the available De? partment In the city hurried to the sccn>. The difficulties of the Fire Department were immovable. The fire was in -he most inflammable material possible?kilii drled lumber, finished material for door;, sashes ana blinds, together with tho shavings and tr?sh that is left from work? ing in such material, in the rear and ward which the hungry flames reaced to the Hank of the fierce llames were? piled thousands of feet of lumber, to? ward which the hungry flames reached out its fterytongues, while directly in front and separated by a narrow alley wast the office building in the second story of which was t.'so a lot of imilam mable material. The fire, wnich originated in the shed on Tenth Street, had reached the main factory, and when the firemen reached the scene angry tongues of llames were licking from the windows of tho building, threatening to envelop the whole plant, in the angle formed by the ractory and j shed was the large dry-kiln, tilled with I lumber. j...is soon caught, and the fierce ? flames shot high into the air. making the ? surroundings as light as ?ay. BRAVE WORK. Into this narrow alley, where the dense! smoke belched fort has from an inferno. ? the firemen fought their way, and from the roof of the office building others were; pouring streams, which for a time seemed to but add to the fury of the flames. In tho rear two strong streams were delug? ing the sheet-iron walls of the dry kiln, but the seething mass within burned on unchecked. Gradually the water began to tell and the huge fiamos would sink for an instant, only to rise to an increased height and to throw out an even greater heal. Clouds cf steam arose from where the water dashed against the red sides of the kiln, and volumes of smoke arose heavenward. Clouds of sparks ascended and glittered like another firmanent brought closer to earth. WORK TELLS. But the work of the brave firemen be? gun to tell, and slowly but surely they gained headway and succeeded in master? ing the arch enemy. The main factory was gutted, resulting in the loss of valuable machinery and a large amount of finished material; the shed where the fire originated was to? tally destroyed, and the dry kiln, with its contents of lumber in various stages of seasoning, is little more than ashes and debr's. The total loss sustained cannot be given accurately, but is placed at between forty and fifty thousand dollars. Mr. Wh'tehurst carried insurance to the amount of $33,000. all of which was ?placed through Messrs. J. B. Moore it Co. Man's Li?e Was Lost. Mr. Whitehurst has been at this loca? tion abo?it seventeen years. He has had at legist two fires before this, but at neither of these times was his place so greatly damaged. The first fire was occa? sioned by the burning of another plant in the re.tr of his. The last fire was about eight years ag>. Then a negro w? nt to the oil-room with a lamp. The room was fired by the lamp and the ne? gro was burned to death. The factory has alv^ays enjoyed a fine trade. Th?"? destruction of it will occasion the idhn'^ss of fif?y men. Mr. Whitehurst declares that he will rebuild at once. EXPOSITION PLAN IS TAKING SHAPE Ter-Centenary Matters Before Promi? nent Gen'Iemen?Meefng Here To-Night. Representatives of Tidewater A'irginia met yesterday afternoon in Murphy's Ho? tel in response to a proclamation, from the Governor asking that this step be taken as preliminary to an active cam? paign in the interest, of the proposed Ter? centenary Exposition to celebrate the first settlement ol* the English In A'ir? ginia. The meeting was entirely infor? mal. Several legi^ators were present, the Tidewater district being well represented. Mr. G. T. Sheppard, secretary of the j Hampton Roads-Jamestown Exposition I Company, was thers. and afterwards in ! speaking of the gathering and its pur- j I poses, said: "This was not <i committee meeting. 'in fact, there is no committee as yet. The 1 gentlemen who met to-day are here mere , ly to find out what the Governor wants | ?lone, as we are meeting in response to ! his call. Once an organization is formed, j every effort will be turned toward the j success of this exposition. We shall ask the help of this city, of the State and of | the country at largo in this enterprise. ?'Once we find out the Governor's ideas | on the subject, there will probably be j perfected immediately plans for the fur ? theraiice of the exposition enterprise. We j believe that the people are sufficiently ? interested in the matter to make the af : fair a great success, and shall certainly '. try to do <:>ur part to make it so." ? One of Richmond's lirst meetings in the | interest of getting the exposition here ! will be held this evening at the Virginia Historical Society rooms. Those to be in this meeting will be committees respec? tive!*.* from the Chamber of Commerce. the City Council and the Society for the Preservation of A'irginia Antiquities. The object of the meeting is somewhat dif? ferent from that of the meeting- at Mur "hy"s yesterday afternoon. It is to see what steps can be taken to bring the ex? position to Richmond. All realize that Xnrf?-?lk is iroinjr to do all in its oow?r to get it. And no one blames that eriter prisii-.rr city for it. cither, but th? **>eoi>!e of Richmond are of the opinion that this is the most appropriate place for the exposition to be held. Quite a number of <-tic?re?-?*ons will be mnd',* as to how the great'show can be brought to Richmond. On?? of the first things to bo done is to stir up sentiment in the project to bring th?*. exposition to the Capital city. To do - this many believe it wise to put some protrresslve. inaa-netic and enthusiastic business man at the head' of the move? ment. This may be considerc-.l to-pJeht. ROMANTIC STORY OF HIDDEN'GOLD Robber Confesses After Many Years. BURIED TREASURE. Federal Soldier Offers to Reveal the Hiding Place, LAW SUIT FOLLOWED LOSS Mr. Wood ill's Statement Tnat Money En? trusted to His Keeping Was Taken ?rom liim Was Disbelieved by Fel? low Directors, tut is Now proved lo Have Been True. A story with all tiie romantic interest of the adventures of Captain Kidd', and containing- such details as a robbery, law suit, a hidden treasure and a confession, was told by Judge Berryman Given yes? terday. The robber, who was a Federal soldier, not only admits having stolen the gold, but has a map of the place where it is buried, and offers to show the hidden treasure on condition that lie be not prosecuted. Xear the close of the war, when the | Federal forces were overrunning Danville, j the directors of a bank there divided out the cash, amounting to live thousand ! dollars in gold each, among themselves, I for safekeeping, the idea being that in j this way most, if not all, of the assets | of the bunk could be saved. After the war the directors held a meeting and. each one produced the five thousand dollars in gold except Mr. Wad? dill, who stated that he took his live thousand dollars home and that a Yan? kee soldier entered his house and after severely choking him and threatening his life succeeded in getting the money. Mr. Waddill's statement was verified by his wife in every particular. The other di? rectors were incredulous, and there was the usual suspicion against Mr. Waddill. The bank sued for the money and a long and expensive litigation began, which re? sulted in Mr. Waddill being declared by the Supreme Court of Appeals not re? sponsible. ADMITS HAVING TAKEN' IT. Mr. Waddill was represented by Judge Berryman Green and ,???. George XV. Cabell. "The "bank was represented, by an equally strong array of counsel. All the parties to the litigation are now dead, ex? cept Judge Green, who brought a re? markable story from Danville yesterday. He says that just before taking the. train, the postmaster came running to him, bringing him a letter he had re? ceived from Ohio. Tbc postmaster saiil he remembered as a boy carrying some law books to Judge Green when he was trvintr the celebrated Waddill ease in Danville, and being the only living nan engaged in the trial, thought he could tell him something about the meaning of the letter. Judge Green says the "?'riter went on to state that he was a Federal soldier and. while in Danville just before the end of the war. he had gone into a. man's house nnd secured live tho?>?--ind dollars in gold; that being pressed for time, h? buried the geld nnd was hur? ried off with his regiment before he vas able to re-turn n**ul unearth it. The writer stilus that he has a man of th?3 location and will .return to Danville nnd secur?? the gold and return It tri the own^r. if he- is guaranteed protection from arr?,ct ???t? ?-ir?sec?tion by the authorities of A'ir? ginia. ?WANTS T*.VP*p,VRi^=! PATD. He ?fters if this is done to como to Danville, locate tb.2 money and deliver it the proper owners, provided that out of the aoinunt his traveling expenses will be paid. Another interesting phase of the case is that ".Mayor Sutherlin. long since dead, and father-in-law ??f Col. Francis L. Smith, a member of the Con? stitutional Convention, 'bought up all the assets' of the Bank of Danville, ar.d if the money is recovered it will be de? clared assets, and will go to Mrs. Smith, as heir of her father. IS FI'LI, OF INTEREST. It is ?a fresh, bright story Judge Green is the central finire in. and has enough of tragedy., romance and originality about it to awaken the interest of the most prosai?". The lifting of the veil of suspi? cion from tho names of Mr. and Mrs. Waddill long years after their death and the prospect of five thousand dollars, less a hundred or two. to a rharmin-r lady nre not the least Interesting denouements of this most unusually interesting story ?from real life. CABINET MEETING. nsalar Decisions Were Principa! Topic of Conversation. (By Associateli Presi".) WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 3.?The Cabinet meeting to-day was principally consumed in a discussion of the insular decisions handed down yesterday by the Supreme. Court. On the whole, it is be? lieved the views of the majority of the I court were quite satisfactory to the ad ! ministration." It Avas pointed out that the I ultimate results of the decisions are in I a measure speculative at present, with | lhe exception of customs dues collected j in this country on goods shipped ! from the Philippines, since the ratification oi the. Paris treaty will have to be re? funded. It is not thought, however, that the aggregate will be large; and Secrc : tary Gage thinks that it will be within , on.? million dollars. The present tariff now in operation in this country. Mr. Gage thinks, will need | little or no revision. . The preparation Of a tarifL* from the Philippines into the United States, will, he thinks, consume a good deal, of time, but Congress by joint resolution may continue the duties contained in the Dingley tariff.

That was the positive statement made h?re yesterday by a gen? tleman in a position to know. But -while it cannot be learned here just who does own the controlling inter? est in the "Good Luck" Powder, it is cer? tain that a great deal of tho stock was sold last summer to persons out of the city, and that the bulk of the stock is not owned here now. It is also known that Mr. Egbert Leigh.

It is also a fact that while the majority of the stock is not owned here, the man? agement of the manufactory has not been changed and it ii* uot likely to be. ?Mr. Leigh remains ?president of the company and all of the former employes are re? tained. When the stock was bought up last summer rumors of the sale were printed in the Richmond papers, but noth? ing could be learned from an authentic source. No one here would say a word. And no one will talk now; that is, tell anything- and allow his name lo be use as authority. But all that is stated above is published on the authority of a gentle? man who knows what he was talking ? about. Interest in the matter is revived at present by a recent publication in the Grocery World, of Philadelphia.

About forty witnesses were present, mainly for the prosecution, but few wero examined. Olive Cropsc'y, the missing girl's sister, repeatet?^he facts concerning ,her sister's disappearance, which have been printed. She was greatly affected and several times broke down and cried. Cross-examined by Attorney Aydelette, she repeated her testimony without variance. FATHER'S TESTIMOXY. W. H. Cropsey. Ella's father, next tes? tified, corroborating the previous witness, telling nothing new, save that he said he was the last man who would accuse the son of his friend, Wilcox. who had been kind to him, but that he believed he knows where his daughter is. and had, uninstigated by the Citizens' ?L*ommittee, caused Jim Wilco:.- to be arrested the second time. He ?lid this, he said, because Jim, when he appealed to him to tell him ? when: Nellie was. seemed "cold," and ? answered .that he had told all he was ? going to tell. Fannie Mitchell, colored, swore that Jim Wilcox called' on her yesterday ap? parently knowing that she would testify; that she. on the night Miss Cropsey dis? appeared, ScvW him at midnight entering his father's house, coming in a direction opposite from the Cropsey residence, and hinted that she could uot tell this. On cross-examination she was confused and uncertain as to what he said. SCUFFLE IX THE PORCH. Alexander Brownley, colored drayman, followed, but told nothing important. Roy i Crawford, who was calling upon Miss j Olive Cropsey on the night her sister dis? appeared, testified that Wilcox, after sitting in the room with Miss Ella AUett and Olive Cropsey and Carrie, their young woman cousin from Xew York, nnd him? self for nearly two hours without directly addressing Ella, called her out on the veranda; that he afterward heard a scuf? fie outside, but supposing it was merely Jim and Ella scuffling in play, paid no attention to the sound; that he left about 11:20 o'clock, saw no one outside the house, and went directly home. The prosecution then rested. Wilcox's attorney, Aydelette, then moved to dismiss for lack of evidence. Asked to put Wilcox on the stand, he agreed to do so, but subsequent!y, after conference with his client, said that Wil? cox refused to testify. After argument, which, with the taking of testimony, consumed four hours. Wilcox was held for trial at the next term of court in 51,000 hail. FEELIXG INTEXS1FIED. Wilcox's refusal to testify has intensi? fied the general belief that he knows what has become of the missing girl. Diving apparatus was sent from Norfolk to Elizabeth City this afternoon and divers will examine the bottom nf the Pasqii?tank River to-morrow searching for Miss Cropscy's body. Norfolk detectives are scouring this city to-night for the missing girl, who may. they think, be concealed here.
