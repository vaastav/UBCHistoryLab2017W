OPENING Of River And Harbor Congress In Washington Washington, Dec. 8 Tho imporve ment of coast and inland waterways will be urged, as an Important adjunct of tho national defense program, at the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, which opens here today. During tho past two years no new improvements have been provided for In the appropriations of the govern ment, and tho budgets drawn up for these improvements have been howl ed at as "pork barrels." It Is predict ed that heavy pressure will be brought to bear on congress for a big appropriation for river and harbor improvements. Tho claims of the waterway Improvement boosters will rest mainly on the now Issue of na tional defense, and tho delegates ar riving today are hopeful of putting a big sharo of the defense funds Into providing better wnter accommoda tions as an Important phase of pre paredness.

Hampton Moore of Pennsylvania, who will lay stress on tho valuo of Improved ln- jland waterways as an aid to speedy mobilization. Senator Joseph E. Ransdoll of Louisiana says that the convention will "voico a ringing protest against the slanderous ussaults made on wa terways improvements," referring to the filibuster led by Senator Burton of Ohio, which prevented the passage of the river and harbor appropriation bills containing specific appropria tlonstlons for designated projects. Logan Waller Pago, who was for somo years president of tho Ameri can Highway association, is to give an address on tho relation of good roads to waterways. Another speak er will bo Col. C. M.
