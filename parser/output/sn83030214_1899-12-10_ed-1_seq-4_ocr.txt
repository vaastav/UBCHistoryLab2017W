ROBERTS HAS A HEARING. HE DENIES THF CHANCES AND DEMURS' TO THE PBOCBEDINQ? "WITNESSES FROM FTAII TESTIFY AS TO NTS POLYOAMOF8 RKLATION8-FIRST PUB MO SESSION OK THE COMMITTEE Washington. Dec. 9.?The consideration of the ease of Mr Roberts, of Utah, was resumed at 10 o'clock this morning by the House Inves? tigating Committee, Mr. Roberts Basse] present to plead to certain specific questions which had been framed. Tho proceedings were behind closed doors. Mr. Roberts was first asked if he conceded the existence of the court record wherein he pleaded guilty In 1090 under the Edmunds-Tucker law. This he conceded. He ?waa next asked whether, about IKS" or since 1890. he had married plural wives, and had lived with them since that time as wives. To the whole of this charge Roberts pleaded not guilty, and then demurred to the Jurisdiction of the committee for the following reasons: First?On the ground of violation of Constitu? tional righta. in that it attempted to try him for a crime without presentment of indictment hy Grand Jury, and without trial before a Jury and due process of law. Second?That it was an attempt to deprive him of vested property that he held in the emol? umenta of an office for the full term. Third?That the only evidence that could be rightfully considered by the committee waa a court record establishing the guilt, confessed or proven, of the Representative-elect, and that the committee has no right to consider any other evidence. Fourth?That the crime alleged?that of un? lawful cohabitation?even If proven, would not constitute a sufficient crime to bar a member or deprive him of his seat, because innocence of polygamy or unlawful cohabitation is nowhere enumerated In the Constitution as a qualifica? tion for the office of member of Congress, nor is it named in any t'nlted States law applicable to Ftah or any other State. 

ASSERTS HIS RIOHT TO A SEAT. Mr. Roberts argued these points for nearly two hours, referring to law books and answering questions. It was a legal controversy through? out, the facts not being gone into at length. Mr. Roberts concluded by asking that his prima facie right to a seat be at once considered, as the present statue denied to a sovereign State representation In the House at a time when in? jurious legislation affecting that State might be enacted. At the close of Mr. Roberts'* statement the committee held an executive session and then adjourned until 2 p. m. The chairman announced that other meetings would be open, and publicity also was given to the official stenographer's re? port of the morning proceedings. This showed that Mr. Tayler had submitted the questions. In the course of them he ?aid: Charges are made that you were convicted in 1889 of. unlawful cohabitation, and that since then you have been guilty of the same offence; that some years ago you contracted plural mar? riages, and ever since then have maintained po? lygamous relations with these wives. Mr. Tayler also stated as a ba-sis for the in? quiry : One of the material facts to be ascertained is as to whether or not you contracted as early as 1S.S7 plural marriages, and have maintained ever eince polygamous relations with these plural ?wives. The committee Instructs me to say that if you wish to make any statement about this or any other matter which is charged you may do ao in your own way. MR. 

ROBERTS'S ANSWER. The affidavits on file, on which thf foregoing inquiries were made, were also shown to Mr. Rotierte. His answer was substantially as here? tofore given, the written text submitted by him being as follows: First?Roberts concedes the fact established by the records of the Third United States Judicial District Court, in and for the Territory of Utah, submitted for his inspection, to wit, that In 1889, In the Territory of Ctah, he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charged against him of unlaw? ful cohabitation. Second?In the testimony submitted it nowhere appears that there Is affidavit or other testi? mony offered before the committee that Roberts about ?8S7, or previous to October, 18T0, or Blnce, contracted plural marriages, further than may be Inferred from his confession to the misdemeanor of unlawful cohabitation in lNf*'d. h? sel out In the court records, and therefore on that point he enters no plea because there Is no charge or tes? timony alleging It. Third?In the papers submitted, which are supposed to sustain the loose and irregular charges against Mr. Roberts, it nowhere appears that there is any affidavit or other testimony that Roberts, either before or since Idilli, con? tracted plural marriages, but as to the Inquiry of the committee on this subject he specifically denies that since October, 1K90, he has con? tracted any plural marriages. Fourth?To the charge that ever since 1889, when Roberts pleaded guilty to unlawful cohab? itation in the then Territory of Ctah. that he has lived in polygamous relations, in violation of law. he pleads not guilty. DEMURRER. Roberts demurs to the proceedings instituted before the committee on the ground that: First?The committee has no Jurisdiction over Tie to try me for the alleged offence or the of? fence charged Second?Roberts further demurs to the evi? dence and papers upon which the charge of con? tinued polygamous living is based, upon the ground that said papers and evidence do not ?tate facta sufficient to <: DStitnt? a chars? against me that Is in eny way regular or ten? able, or sufficient to deprive me of my prima facie right to take the oath of office and occupy the seat in the House of Representative? to ?which I have beta duly and legally elected, and which election and right is not contested. Third -That sail papers and evidence are smbiguous. unintelligible, incompetent, and of auch character as to make the same not worthy to be considered by the committee; and I ask that my prima facie right to my seat be now considered. A rUBoiC HEARING HELD. The first of the public hearings began at 2 o'clock. At that hour the committee room was crowded with Congressmen, reporters and a delegation representing the Gentile element of Utah. Roberte sat at the foot of the long com? mittee talle, nun documents piled up before him. His secretary was near at hand, bringing him books and other data of reference. Chairman Tayler announced that persons who had taken part in framing the charges were present, and he asked that they be heard. A. T. Schroeder, one of the Gentile delegation from Utah, then came forward, and waa about to proceed ?h-n Mr. Roberts rose hastily and ralaed his hand In protest. "I object," he ?aid. "I object to this witness if he comes here as an "77" Knocks out GRIP A year ago. A year ago the paper? were so full of ?jcare Une? and cartoons of Epidemic Orlp, that the local advertiser? protested that people were being frightened away from the atore?, threat ?nlng the holiday trade.

I object to him If he comes as a witness, on the ground that he is unworthy of confidence, and I propose to establish by the records of the Supreme Court of Utah that he is utterly unworthy of belief." Roberts said he would pit sent the tenth Utah Supreme Court report in support of his allega? tion. Mr. TH.vler answered that Mr. Schrooder BBS not present ns a witness or as counsel, but merely to give the committee such information as he could, and the committee would treat the matter as It saw fit. Mr. Sehroeder remarked that he did not under? stand that he was on trial. Mr. Roberta did not press his objection fur? ther, and Mr. Bchroeder proceeded WTTNBSsMCS FRoM 

UTAH. Mr. Sehroeder said it could be established that Mr. Roberts had maintained and la now maintaining the status of a polygamist; that In 1888 BS plea led guilty of unlawful cohabitation and has since that time continued in that re? lation. Specifically. Mr. Sehroeder said. It could be established that there had recently been born children to his polygamous wives, nmong them being twins born to Cella Dibble Roberts, the reputed second wife of the Congressman elect. These children were reported to M born, he said, on August 11. 1*!?7. and until this morn? ing he had understood they were acknowledged j by Roberts as his. It could also be shown that I be bad been acknowledging i>r. Usaste Bhlpp Roberts as a wife, and Is now maintaining the status of husband toward her: that during all of these tlm * he had ?hing a lawful wife. Louisa Smith Roberts, who also has borne him children. Mr Sehroeder said the witnesses were in Utah, readily accessible If the committee desired to summon them. He suggested that MISS Adah Roberta, the daughter of Mr. Roberts, was now In the city and might be available as ? witness. The Rev. Dr. Stiff, of Utah, was aske.l if he desired to add anything, but said that Mr. Schrooder had covered the (renerai question BUf flciently. and that the detailed evidence would be ready if the committee desired. At this point Representative MePherson, of Iowa, a member of the committee, said he thought thor?? was a misunderstanding among members as to the ?tatua of Mr. Roberts. Some thought lie bad made his statement In order to frani?? an issu??. Other? thought he had ap? peared as a witness and should be subject to cross-examination. He said he feared the com? mittee was gradually drifting to the point where It would have to go 2,500 miles to Utah to hear witnesses, or else brins; witnesses 2,500 mitos to Washington. Chairman Tayler said that Roberts had not appeared SI a witness and was not under oath. Mr. Roberts said hla ?tatement was for the ?purpose Of Joining Issues. He expected and de? sired a ruling on his demurrer, and time to present authorities on this demurrer, for, he said, he was not through with that. He said also that, as a witness, he would hardly be ex? pected to give evidence against himself. The public hearing was then adjourned until Tuesday morning at 1?> o'clock, and the rom mlttee held a private session. 

TALK OF VISITINO UTAH. Mr. Tayler said after the executive session that the committee was considering whether it should go to Utah or have the witnesses come here, and that no decision had been reached. Mr. Sehroeder, against whom Roberts made a protest, paid after the meeting: Mr. Roberts refers to a civil suit brought to set aside an execution sale made by tho Sheriff of Salt' Lake County. I was the attorney for the Judgment creditors, and at the Sheriff's sale became the purchaser In my own name, with the consent of my clients. It Is a long story, but suffice It to say that Judge Rartch, now on the Supreme bench, who tried the case, in ren? dering his oral decision expressly exonerated me from all imputation of actual fraud. Mr. Roberts goes a long way to find means for dis? tracting attention from himself, but the case is urgent, and perhaps I ought to consider him Justified In going to many extremes. It Is understood that the opposition to Rob? erts has suggested that the wives with whom he Is alleged to have maintained polygamous rela? tions be summoned as witnesses. The first wife, it Is paid, would be exempt from testifying against her husband, fis she has a legal status as wife, but this exemption would not extend furth'-r. A sub-oommlttee, consisting of Messrs. Mor? ris. Ltttlefleld and Miera, has been appointed to get up forms of subpoenas, etc., in connection with the summoning of witnesses.

In describing the locality of this agr?gation of sweets and pretty whimsies and artistic table and ballroom decora? tions, one Is puzzled to decide whether to say that Maillard's Is under tiie Fifth Avenue Motel or that the Fifth Avenue Hotel Is over Maillard's; Wheth-r Milliard's faOM Upon Madison Square or Madison Square adjoins Maillard's; whether Maillard's Is nuar tie- Dewey Arch or vie?? ?era?

What have Stelnway & Sons to offer to music lovers this holiday season? Nothing that Is not the most perfect In It.? kind that science and con? science can produce. Rut something there is ex? actly fit for each situation and each part that a piano should fill In our social and musical life. First comes the small Stelnway upright piano, to compact whose delicious musical tone into this tiny shape was probably the great??! feat which Steln? way & Sons aver performed. Within Its own possi? ble range of sonority, the tone of this exquisite little Instrument is a scientific miracle, of purity, sweetness and volume. This Is the piano for the small boudoir or for the first years of musical study. Next comes th?? medium sized upright, In a cas? that indicates the enormous reform which the house of Stelnway has Initiated In the architecture, of its piano cases. Modelled on the lines of pun Doric architecture, the dignity and restfulness of this design ar,? as new to piano-making as they are satisfying to the artistic senne. Then there is tho large Stelnway upright, with a gnat, round, organlike tone, big enough to fill a church-exactly the Instrument for use on public iilatforms, where compactness of floor ?pace and nigh sonority should be combined: the piano par excellence for ?ohool, choir and assembly rooms. Then the Stein way parlor grands, the instruments whose artistio qualities have won their way alike Into the castles of the European nobility, the pal? aces of the Orient, and the superb drawing rooms | of American aristocracy -tho last refinement of ten- and touch that the art of piano-making ha* I reached. Lastly, there are the Stelnway concert grands. 1 the king? of the concert platform?thope instru t ments which, as music critic? have long conceded. ore absolutely essential to the perfect expression I of concept music, no matter what the skill or who the artist. Put Stelnway & Sons offer more than this. The demands made by the sudden growth of decorative art In the humes of American luxury have been ? met hy art piano cases which are in themselves modela worth study. In the Art Piano Room In Stelnway Mall may be seen a series of piano? each ! of which will be the choicest ornament, and, more , than that, the key to the decoration of the room In which It will eventually be placed. Pianos carved, glided and embellished In Ihe rich dignity of the period of lyvils XIV: pianos lending them | selve? to the airy grace of the rococo epoch that , followed him; pianos conceived In the dainty and ??lsh pruderies of Marie Antoinette; pianos bearing the wreaths and torches of Napoleon; p| in,'s In the exquisite proportions and simple In? lays of the school of Adams, Sheraton and Chip? pendale mole's and design?, in short, to produce which the collections made by Queens like Catha? rine de' Melici ani dignitaries like Cardinal Ifasa rln, Oobelln portfolios and the great frescoes of the Italian Renaissance have been ransacked to serve ?j studies, and which are now within the reach of the American homes that nestle In the myriad pal mi s throughout our broad commonwealth. COMMON SCENTS VS. UNCOMMON. Tn the use or the abuse of perfumes is to be found a sure touchstone to refinement. Among savage races quantity, not quality, Is the object sought; as we go upward In the social scale the perfumes used grow more and morn delicate. Nature's laboratory?the flowers is the only source of supply. Lundborg a half century ago wrested fro-n Nature the process hy which tho flowers , could be plundered of their sweets and these stored In Sll their dainty freshness. The association of certain ideas with tertaln odors has long been recognized and lias led to the adoption by very "chic" women of a favorite perfume like Lund borg's Vlo-Vlolet. While Lund borg makes many perfumes, they are i all of one quality- the best. Their natural fra ' graneo never deteriorates Into the stale and siekly | odor of perfumes having rank Ingredients a? a, basis. This superlative merit does not result in I prohibitive prices; on tho contrary, Lundborg/s Incomparably dainty perfumes are cheaper than trie ' foreign article. FINK F.NORAVINGS AND PRINTS. To one of artistic tastes there can be given no , more acceptable present than some exquisite speci? men of the engraver's handiwork, a choice selection of which, as well as of etchings, prints?ancient and modern, from the earliest discovery of print? ing?in black and white, photographs and platino rraphs. In endless variety, can he found at II. Wunderlich A CO.'?, Vo. SC8 Broadway, opposite "Huyler's."
