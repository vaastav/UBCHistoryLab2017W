The volume of transpeetation which was offered tol his read after 3r. Forbes put the ter minal at Chicago. was so great as to prove an breeistible temptation to New York Mpital.

It ran &aet parallel with the Mich iga Central, although its line was south of Iake Erie. while the Michi-' r ga Central was north. When the4 read was completed its managers wee eenvinced that aempetition was the life Of trade for railroads as well as for other business. Competition upon a staggering scale was main tained. It went so far that it became evident that It might bring both roads to bankruptcy. Then Mr. rorbes suggested the pool. His plan was adopted. Competition that was suicidal ceased and both cempanie became prosperous. At the the of the civil war it was necessa.y te perfect Certain co-operation between the searead aempanies which Invotv ad a form af pooling. It was accepted by the government without protest and by the pubICe as a reasonable tt to af. Years later the pool- was again adeuted In order to put an end to s c9lled aut-threat competition which the trunk lines had maintained for: ame years. The plan went so far as to allow differentials to certain of the railroad lines running from New York or Beehm to Chicaso and other pots in the West. Congress. sup-: pIemented by the declsions of the Su-I Morine Court put an end to this method of co-operation. Yet at the time the law was passed there were some who asserted that If the government regu laed or supervised the railroads and had authority over rates then there was ne reason why pooling should - t be permitted.

Prac tically no outside trading was noticed and the antir day's turnover amount ed to but 39L0 shares. The reason for the apathy was ap parenL The street was awaiting the assembling of the new Congress. the President's message, to be delivered tomorrow, and word of some deter mination in the freight rate case, ex 'atlr at any time. Initiative was almost wholly lack either In buying or selling. Prices i'..ared rather to sag than to give a' under pressure. Industrials made veral half-hearted displays of g. 19th, but showed net losses at the doming for the most part. Rails were w-ik, most of them sustalning losses of from 1-4 per cent to a full point The transportation situation and how it will be handled by Congress formed the subject of most discussion. Wall Street financiers freely expressed belief that there must be legislation for the effective working of the pro posed pooling of railroad facilities. Uncertainty as to how far Congress may be depended upon to formulate constructive legislation for the Im mediate relief nepeded had not a little to do with the hdiltancy to make Com mitments.
