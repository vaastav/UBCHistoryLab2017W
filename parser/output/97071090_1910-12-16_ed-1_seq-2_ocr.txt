The action came ns n great surprise, as President Taft In his message to congress a week ago stated that loan negotiations were practically com plete, nnd tho appointment of an ad viser to China nn assured fact. What effect the action will have on tho many financial deals between this country and China now pending Is not known. The $50,000,000 loan, known as tho Chlan Ch)W, which was to be used In tho construction of tho pro posed Chlan Chow-AIgan railway, Is about leady for some sort of a ilef- Inlto move by tho parties Involved. Other Chinese railroads, it has been planned, are to be built with Amer ican money, and it Is reared that the attitude of the Peking government may bring negotiations to a stop. Tho loan was to be used also by China In reforming the Chinese eur inncy system. A preliminary agree ment already had been reached and It wiib a disagreement over tho final at Ifleat Ion of tho terms of the loan that brought about the action today.
