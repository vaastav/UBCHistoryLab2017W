OTHER PAPERS COMMENT By the Associated Press. LONDON, December 3.?President Wii son'* message to Congress has the fullest possible prominence in the morning news papers, but It reached London too late for much considered comment. The Dally News receives warmly the President's declaration that peace should be based on generosity and Justice to the exclusion of selfish claims. It adds: "It would be affectation to pretend that this language echoes the declarations of the European spokesmen of the alliance. It is the voice of a statesman whose vision comprehends the world, while theirs com prehends only half a world. "If President Wilson could have said earlier what he said yeeterday. and ir in Great Britain. France aJid Italy the responsible leaders had made his language their own. Ruspia might be today driving the enemies from her borders. It may be too late to convince Russia of the identit} of aim of herself and the allied democ racies. but It must not be too late tor those democracies to learn from tneir greatest representative how democracies should comport themselves in war and how they should attain peace. No Kinship Between Spirit. "In the light of President Wilson's speech, a statement that will mean the wiping off the slate of much that should never have been written on It 1s impera tive. There is no kinship between the spirit of yesterday's speech and the spirit of knockout blows, or economic warfare, or after-the-war boycotts." The Times says there are no half tones in the President's address, add ing: "There are no ambiguous phrases on which militarists may feed the il lusions of their dupes, no hints of com promise and no suggestion of faltering or doubt to raise the spirits of the pa cific with this straightforward and logical statement of America's war aims the last hope of the pacifists must founder." The Times reiterates that formerly It expressed dissent with President Wil son's distinctions between the German people and their ruler and says it can no more distinguish between them than the President can any longer dis tinguish between Germany and Austria Hungary. believing them willing ac complices of their ruler. Influence Is Doubtful. The editorial of the Dally Chronicle Is mainly a paraphrase of the speech In a sympathetic tone and without a definite expression of opinion. The Daily Graphic says: "Whether this restatement, so lofty in spirit, so forward looking in effect, will have any Influence on German opinion is doubt ful. Then the only resort Is to Inflict such a military defeat upon Germany as to convince the Germans of the in famousness of their rulers. In this con nection it is an excellent omen that the conference in Paris reached such a com plete unanimity. America was repre sented at the conference and there fol lows that the war alms of the allies no longer can be described in any sense as imperialistic." None of the editorials dwells es pecially on the result for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but brief references Imply that It is r garded aa logical and desirable.

MADISON, Wis, December 8.?Rep resentative john M. Nelson and his were arraigned in federal *?"r^yesterday on the charge of eon i?irv to evade the draft act Both SEmSSa not guilty and wets ralss?<1 ?ader Md* ? ? His Address to Congress Quickly Heralded Through* / out the World. President Wilson's address to Con* press yesterday was heralded through* out the world by the United States gov* ernment. The achievement Is regarded as probably the greatest publicity feat ever undertaken. Distribution of the message abroad was personally directed from New Tork city by George Creel, | chairman of the committee on publio I information. Nearly every known means of com* munication?express train, telephone, telegraph, wireless and submarine ca ble?was utilised In transmitting tha address. While an operator in New York was clicking off its text on a transcontinental wire direct to San Francisco, where it was Immediately re layed to the orient, another at his side was sending a Spanish translation to Colon, Panama Canal Zone, from where ft; radiated throughout Central and South American capitals. Wireless operators picked the Presi dent's words out of the air and relayed them to Caribbean sea points. Doubt less many ships in these waters knew what was being said in Washington at almost the same time the address was being distributed over telegraphic sys* stems in this country. 35,000 Miles of Wire Employed. It is estimated approximately 85.000 miles of telegraph and cable wires were called into use in transmitting the mes sage Chairman Creel received a copy of the address in New York city by special courier from Washington early yester Kay. A corps of typists was put at work j fn a locked room to make duplicate copies. Meanwhile, in an adjoining room, 1 twas being translated into French and Spanish. These rooms were guarded as a precau tion against the contents of the message becoming public prematurely. Upon receiving word from Washington that President Wilson had begun deliver ing the address a corps of telegraph and cable operators, at Mr. Creel's direction, immediately began their task of wiring the message broadcast?across the United states to San Francisco, there to be re layed to Shanghai and thence to Toklo and Peking; across the Atlantic to Lon don, where it was picked up and resent to the continent; and down the eastern coast to Panama for retransmission to Central and South American points. Radiates From London and Paris. At I^ondon and Paris the message was placed In the hands of the established commercial and governmental news {agencies. From London the French translation was forwarded to Paris. London also served as a relay point to Stockholm, Copenhagen. Christiania and The Hague. From Stockholm a copy of the message was sent to the Ameri can embassy at Petrograd. London also filed to Algiers and other northern African points. Fwom Paris were served Lisbon. rid. Home and Bern. Nw York sent the address to South America, the most southern point be- ' ing Rio de Janeiro. This cable runs by way of Colon to Chile, Colon re layed to Bogota, Valparaiso. Quito and Lima, Lima, in turn, forwarding to La Pas and Valparaiso to Santiago and Buenos Aires. Colon a Distributing: Point. Colon was the point from which ths message radiated throughout Central America. In the absence of perfected news agencies with extensive connec tions in Central and South America, copies of the message were placed di rectly in the hands of American min isters in these countries for immediate release to newspapers and distributing organizations In their Jurisdictions.
