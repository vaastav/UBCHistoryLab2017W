COLUMBIA. Sunday -doming, December 9, 1866. Tlic Situation. One of tho sensation correspond? ents of tbe New York Herald states that tbe message of tho President, as sent to Congress, is very different from tbe one which lie originally pre? pared. How much truth there is in this statcmcut, we know not. It is, however, we think, evident that in discussing tbe restoration question, tbe President was careful to use no language which could justly offend bis bitter enemies in thc two Houses. A special telegram in tho Baltimore San says that "the even temper of tho President's message is having an excellent effect, not in behalf of con? ciliation, but in behalf of the dignity and self-respect of tho House as a legislative body. " And tho debates in the Senate upon several questions which have arisen, indicate that that body may, perhaps, be expected to be less radical in its measures than Stevens' and Forney's threats have led ns to fear it wauld be. The Na? tional Republican declares that, accord? ing to the official reports of the pro? ceedings of the Senate and the House, on Monday, Sumner and Stevens "were discarded as leaders;" that "their lead was squarely declined by a vote of both Houses-Sumner on suffrage in thc District, and Stevens in his attempt to prevent thc reading of the message." This assumption, however, is hardly warranted by the facts stated; for both Stevens and Sumner wero out-voted at the last session upon several questions, yet the radicalism of Congress was none the less manifest in its measures. Stevens did not approve of tho con? stitutional amendment, although ho introduced it and voted for it; and Sumner was left in thc minority upon the question of thc admission of Colo? rado into the Union. The tone of the Northern press indicates that the message has bad a mollifying effect upon some at least of the radical faction. The Philadel? phia Inquirer (radical) says "that thc President has written with candor and dignity, and with tho utmost re? spect to Congress. It is to be hoped that this judicious policy will have its effect upon members of Congress, and that whatever may be doue con? trary to the views of the President will bc transacted with calmness, anc without asperity or passion." Th< Philadelphia Bulle'?a [radical) says il is "gratified with tho moderation, and with thc respectful tone whici bc maintains toward the 'co-ordinate branche.-; of tbe Government.' " Tb( New York Times, which is now radi cal, applauds the President's "goo^ temper," but not his "good taste.' The Tribune counsels kindness, pati ence, and charity, though it secs no thing in- the message which "an^ loyal man can read with comfort o hope." The National Intelligence, says: "We are under no apprehen sions about Congress territorializinj tho South." Governor Pierpoin assures us in his message that, how over it may bc with the other States Virginia is in no danger of beiug sub jected to this harsh treatment. Bu the resolution passed by Congres includes Virginia in the list of State for which it is proposed to establisl territorial governments. It must b confessed that, to take tho most hope ful view of the situation, our politi cal condition is a deplorable one. A 

NEGRO CoiiiiiTs TWO MURDER; AND IS AN ACC03_PLICE IN A T Ililli). London Jones, the uegro who wa hung at Chester, on the 30th ult., f o the murder of Mr. A. D. Walker made a full confession before bein; led to the scaffold. According to bi own account, in April, 1S64, he kille John Cureton, near Columbia, an attempted to kill George Brown, wb had married Cureton's daughter. H stated that he did not intend to ki Mr. Walker, but to rob him, an says that ono of his accomplices fire tho mortal shot. This was on Jul and on tho Wednesday next, 1 and bis party kilred and robbed M Laue, in Newberry. Before his exi cution, Jones professed great repen ance, and gavo tue names of all h accomplices. THE STEAMSHIP SEW ANN?E-Tl missing boat containing the captn: and part of the crew of tho abo steamer, (the loss of which was n ticed in yesterday's issue,) arrived Wilmington, Thursday afternoon. Commanding Genera.]'!* Kcpoj-t. Gen. Grunt hus submitted to the Secretary of War the reports of Gens. Sheridan and Sickles-the Generals respectively of thc Gulf and tho Department of the South. Ir presenting these reports, Geu. Grant thus speaks of the condition of the South: "Passing from civil war of the mag? nitude of that in which thc United States has been engaged to govern? ment through tho courts, it has been deemed necessary to keep a military force in all thc lately rebellious States, to ensure the execution of law and to protect lifo and property against the acts of those who, as yet, will acknowledge no law but force. This class has proven to be much smaller than could have been expected after such a conflict. It has, however, been sufficiently formidable to justify the course Which has been pursued. On the whole, tho condition of* thc States thal were in rebellion against the Government may be regarded as good enough to warrant thc hope that but a short timo will intervene before tho bulk of the troops now occupying them eau bo sent to our growing Territories, where they are so much needed." Sheridan's report is long, but of little interest. Its drift is to show how admirably he has put down the rebellion sino the ivar, and how con? summately ho has managed Mexican affairs. Gen. Sickles' report is still longer than Sheridan's, but the following on "Hebel Associations" is the only portion which will interest Caro? linians: "It has likewise been found neces? sary to prohibit associations or as? semblages composed of persons who served in thc rebel armies, and having for their object thc perpetuation uf any t military or other organiza? tion engaged in thc rebellion. This prohibition has not been enforced against any society^ which has, in good faith, confined its action to the charitable relief of disabled and in? digent survivors, and the ordinary observances for thc burial of tho dead. "Recently a meeting of one of these associations was made thc occasion for an address delivered by Gen. Wade Hampton, in which he is re? ported to have commented lipon tho Government and thc armies of thc United States, and especially upen the operations of Generals Shorrruai. and Sheridan, in a manner well ol culatcd to incite discontent and hostility against the authorities of tho United States. I have directed an inquiry into tho matter, in order that the association of rebel soldiers may be suppressed, and Gen. Hamp? ton admonished to observe tho terms of his parole, if, upon investigation, it shall appear to have been disre? garded in this instance."' TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE SOUTH.-The following is thc resolu? tion looking to a territorial form of government for thc Southern States, which was offered iu the House of Representatives by Mr. Brooman, of Pennsylvania. The resolution was adopted by a vote of yeas 107; nays 37: Resolved, That the Committee on Territories be instructed to inquire into tho expediency of reporting a bill providing territorial governments for tho several districts of country within the jurisdiction of tho United States, formerly occupied by the once existing States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louis? iana, Arkansas, and Texas, and gi.ving to all adult male inhabitants .born within the limits of thc United States, or duly naturalized and not partici? pants in the late rebellion, full, equal political rights in such territorial gov? ernments. The Virginia Legislature organized on Tuesday, and thc Governor's Mes? sage was received. He favors the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, and says that tho South? ern States are still under the ban of the Government, and there is no dis? honor in accepting the terms pro? posed. The persons disqualified have no right to complain, and those who are not disqualified cannot get better terms. He speaks in highly compli m tary terms of the radical Con? gress. ?-???-? COMMITTEE OP INVESTIGATION.-We see it stated that a Congressional Committee will leave Washington this week for Anderson, in this State, to investigate the facts of tho j murder of three United States sol I diers in that District last year. KINKY.-A petition is being circu? lated in Boston, and is being numer? ously sigued, praying Congress to so amend the Constitution that each and every State of this Union shall determine for itself the "status of citizenship and the qualification for suffrage;" but in all elections for Fede? ral officers, any proscription on ac? count of race or color shall make void and illegal such election. Vii" District Courts. As thc question of thc abolition of the District Courts will probably bc brought beforo tbo Legislature, we subjoin the following remarks from thc Lancaster Ledger : Tbo advantages to be derived from the establishment of the District Courts should be very groat to war? rant thc additional expense to the Judiciary of the State which these Courts will occasion. Withour enter? ing into minute particulars, we believe it will be safe to assume that the ex? penses of the judicial brauch of the State Goverument will bc doubled by thc organization of ibo District Courts. There aro thirty-one judicial Dis? tricts in the Slate, for each of which a District Judge has been elected, who will receive fr om the Treasury of the Stato a salary of live hundred dollars, making in all thc sum of $15, 500. lu addition, they will receive annually from th^ District Court fund from five hundred to one thousand dollars, as designated in the District Court Act, amounting in the whole to the sum of 19,400. The two sums united, make for thc pay of Judges $34,000, to be derived in part from the common treasury of the State and in part from the parties who are so unfortunate as to be involved in law suits, either ou the criminal or tbe civil side of the Court. The District Court will sit four times a year, and at each session there will bo in attendance "?* full panel of Grand and Petit and Pleas Jurors." Should the Court sit a whole week, at each session the per diem of jurors for the District Courts, to say notbiug of mileage, will reach tbe sum of $80,352 annually-a sum quite sufficient to inaugurate a system of common schools and to educate every indigent child in tho State. Should the sessions last but half of tho week on an average, the expenses on this score would still be enormous, without counting the individual ex? penso and inconvenience c^ jurors in being called so frequently from their homes, to thc neglect of their private interests. Another item of expense which can? not be estimated with any degree of accuracy, but whick will amount to a large sum, is the costs of prosecution in criminal cases, Avhere collection cannot be had from the convict. In all such cases, one-half of tue costs will be paid by the State, including the costs of the Solicitor or bis depu? ty. Heretofore the Solicitor's costs ($15) was not paid unless it could be collected from the party convicted. By the late law, every convict in the District Court who is unable to pay the costs of his prosecution (and the smallest number will be able) will cost the State $7.50, Sobcitor's costs. CHICKENS !
