CONGRESSMAN PORDSET TO MANUFACTURERS' ASSO. - i-'Undeir thie .Constitution, Congress . cannot delegate to any man or set of t men the right to impose duties 'and fix the amoutn of duty, except ; UDdr certain conditions." I have talked to the President, not flinioe wrtein'g this message, but be fore. I laid a. plan before the Ways and Means Committee. I am not fthe father of the thought. . I thought It a good one and so does the Presi dent. That is this. The Congress can flx a maximum and a minimum tariff. Make it very low and very Jhfcg-h and dirept that the executive "ehall determiine the foreign cost of an article and the American cost of pro duction, and apply a duty sufficiently fliigh to make up the difference no matter what couAtry the goods come .from. -"Such a law has been held to be (Constitutional by the Supreme Court, and the 111 nations of the world im portlnsr tfnto the United States that ihave dlifEeirent costs of production 'then would pay an amount of duty 'that would land the goods from every country in the United . States at the 'American price laid down here, so that no country would have an ad vantage over the other and none of ihem over the American manufactur 'er . That is what the President means. That is the power I want :or give the President of the United IGtates. and diireict him to find the jicoat of production and apply a duty iBUfflcie.ntly high to bring that cost Hty our cost of production.

PRESIDENT HARDING'S MESSAGE ON FLEXIBLE TARIFF. "I am no, unmindful of constitu tional difficulties. These can be met by giving authority to Che Chief Ex ecutive who could proclafim addi tional duties to meet conditions which the Congress may designate. "At tihis point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the Executive's pow ers or add to the responsibilities of the office. They are already too large. If there were any other plan I would prefer it. "The grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily brirag the Tariff Commission into new and enlarged activities, because mo Executive could discharge such a duty except upon the information acquired and recom mendations made by this commission. Bue the plan is feasible, and the proper functioning of the board would give us a better administration of a defined policy than ever can be made possible by tariff duties prescribed without inflexibility." Former City Clerk Has Narrow Escape While traveling on Norman street late yesterday afternoon an automo bile driven by J. Alex Robinson, for mer city clerk for many years, was rammed by a truck near the corner of Laurel avenue. Robinson's father. John H. Robinson; a. ndece.

The truck was owned by Eames & Meeker, plumbers, ajid was being driven by John N. MeQuinn, 20. of 191 Rocton avenue. He was arrest ed for reckless driving and for being without a license.

AUTO ACCIDENTS REDUCED BY ONE DURING NOVEMBER Hartford, Dec. 9 The number of automobile accidents fatal to chil dren was reduced to one during the month of November, according to motor vehicle department figures made public yesterday. Deaths of children under 10 years old as a re sult of automobile accidents have steadily decreased. it was shown, since the observance of "Safety Week," Sept. 19 to 26. The peak of such fatalities was reached that week and the subsequent decline was ascribed today to the fact that par ents and children, awakened by the intensive campaign to the growing menace of traffic carelessness, have heakened to the educational effort made by state, municipal and civic organizations.
