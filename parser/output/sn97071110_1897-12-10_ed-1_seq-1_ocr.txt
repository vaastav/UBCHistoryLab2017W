It shows that during the fiscal year ended June 80, 13 ., the total number of patients treated at hospitals and the dispensaiiea connected with the service was 54,477. Although the total num ber of patients treated was 673 in ex cels of those treated during the pre vious fiscal year, the expenditures were vu r,'ti which is $21,000 less than the previous year. The annual report of Jatnca H. E jkles, controller of the currency, for the year ended October 31, 1897, opens with a brief resume of the history of the legis lation which constitutes the present National-bank act, and invites the at tention of congress to amendments to the law recommended in former reports, without specifically repealing them. The controller renews his recommend ation of last year, urging that national bank examiners be paid an annual sal ary instead of fees, as now. Further information from Washing ton respecting the proposed canal and locks for the channel at the dalles is to the effect that it is proposed to push the work with a deal of rapidity. The contract system and modern methods of excavation and building have made it clear that years need not be spent upon a work of this character. If the con tract for improving the Columbia by a small channel at the dalles is adopted it will no doubt be stipulated that the work must be done with rapidity.

The receipts of " the customs so far this fiscal year undoubtedly will fall considerably short of estimates made by the managers of the new tariff bill during its pendency in congress. At that, time it was estimated that the customs would yield about $180,000, 000 during the iirst year. The indica tions are now said to be that the re ceipts from this source will not aggre gate more than $165,000,000.

AGAIN IN SESSION. First Kegular Meeting of the Fifty-Fifth Congress. At l oon Monday the first regular ses sion of the 65th congress was launched upon the unknown seas of legislation. Simultaneously at both ends of the cap itol, Speaker Heo.l in tho house and Vice-President llobart in tho seriate, dropped their gavels and called to or der the bodies over which they preside. The sun Rhone brightly from a cloudless sky, making a, glorious bright Decem ber day, with a tine of frost in the air, and a breeze just strong enough to keep the stars and stripes snapping from thf flagstaff's. At the capital crowds swarmed into the corridors at an early hour and choked the marine steps as they ascend ed to the galleries from which they were to view the show. As is usual on such occasions, the reserved galleries were carefully guarded, admission be ing only by card, and the public had grat, difficulty wedging itself into the limited space set aside fot it. In the I'pper Ilanse. The senate chamber at the opening session was a veritable conservatory. The floral display was beautiful. Pre cisely at 12 o'clock the gavel of Vice President llobart fell, and the senate was called to order. An invocation was delivered by Rev. Milburn, the blind chaplain. Seventy-seven senators responded on roll-call. The venerable Mr. Morrill, of Ver mont, was first recognized by the vice president. He offered a resolution, which was passed, in the usual form, that the secretary inform the house that ' the senate was in session and ready to proceed to business. Allison of Iowa presented a resolu tion that a committee of two senators be appointed to join a like committee from the house to inform the president that congress was in session, and pre pared to reoeive any communication he might desire to make. The resolution was passed, and' the vice-president named Allison and Gorman as u eenate committee.' By resolution of Cullom of Illinois, the time of tho daily meetings of the senate was fixed at noon. On motion of Hale of Maine, a recess was then taken until 1 o'clock? At 1:30 the senate reassembled and tho committee, headed by Gorman, re ported. The president's message was presented by Mr. Pruden at 1:30 o'clock, and was laid before the senate and read. ' In the Lower Mouse. The house of representatives present ed an animated appearance long before noon. The surrounding corridors were filled with jostling, moving crowds be fore 11 o'clock. The galleries which overlook the floor were black with peo ple. Floral tributes for members were numerous, and in some instances im posing. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12 Speaker Peed, attired in a black cutaway coat, and wearing a red tie, ascended jfhe rostrum. The crack of the gavel subdued the din on the floor; and conversation in the galleries. In the deep silence which followed the calling of the assemblage to order, prayer was offered by the eminent divino. Rev. Chalres: A., Boney, of England, who delivered an invocation solemn and impressive. The speaKor then directed the clerk to call the roll. The roll call showed the presence of 301 members. There were 55 vacancies from death or resig nation during the recess, and the cre dentials of the members-elect were read by direction of the speaker, who then administered the oath of office to them. On motion of Dingley a resolution wa adopted for the appointment of a com mittee of three to join the senate com mittee to wait upon the president and. inform him that congress was ready to receive any communication he desired to make. The speaker named Dingley, Grosvenor and Bailey for this honor. On motion of Henderson of Iowa daily .ess.ons to begin at noon eaen n ordered. The house then took short , i i recess. When the house reassembled the committee appointed to wait upon the president reported, having perfected its; mission. Mr. Pruden,' who had fol lowed the committee into the hall, im mediately presented the message.which, by direction of the speaker, was read at the clerk's desk. Appropriations Recommended, Secretary Gage Monday transmitted to congress estimates of the appropria tions required for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, as furnished by several executive departments. The total amount called for in the estimates i $462,647,885, which it about $32,000, 000 in excess of the appropriations for 1898, including deficiencies and miscel laneous expenses, and about $41,000, nnn more than was estimated for 1898. Under the head of public works the j treasury department.among other items, i ! asks for $100,000 for the erection of a 3 courthouse, penitentiary, etc., at Sitka, i Alaska, and $50,000 for continuation ; of the work on -the public building : Portland, Or. at Hayti Beady to Fay.

INSURGENTS Town of Guisa Is Wiped Off the Cuban Map. DYNAMITE GUNS WERE USED Every Building In the Town Destroyed Spanish Throughout the l'rovince Are Terror-Stricken. Havana, Deo tl. A further report today on the capture of Guisa by Gen eral Garcia confirms yesterday's" dis natehes, and the report adds that the entire garnsn of the town, composed j of 800 men. died heroically without surrendering. Only four or five of tho Spanish survived and were made pris oners. The Spanish official report describes the terrific effects of the pneumatic dynamite guns used by Garcia. The insurgents fired 72 shots on the fort. Each shot w rought terrible havoc. The gun was operated at a short distance from tho front of the town. Not a singlo house remains. All are blown to pieces. Besides the dynamite guns the insur gents used two field pieces. Garcia sent word to the Spaniards before tho bombardment that they would be pardoned if they would sur render. The only answer was "Long live Spain," and a general volley from all the forts. The town was completely destroyed in 12 hours. Besides 800 regular troops the Spanish had 300 militia and volunteers. The total loss is not exact ly known, but is large. Col. Tovar, who arrived to the rescue of Guisa, reports that it was terrible to see the dead Spanish half buried under the rubbish of the forts. General Pando arrived today in Man- zanillo, from whence he sent a long cable to Blanco, reporting continuous fighting against the insurgents since November 23, especially with Gomez in Santa Clara province. He also gives his first impressions about the war in Santiago de Cuba, declaring that the insurgents are numerous, well armed and daring. Pando intends to feogin an active campaign against Garcia and Rabi, and protect Bayamo and all towns threatened by Garcia in the in terior of the province. His arrival at Manzanillo has caused a great deal of enthusiasm among the Spanish who were panic stricken over the news of the destruction in Guisa. The Cuban victory at (ruisa was the most important of the entire war. Guisa had 8,000 inhabitants. FORCED TO TAKE WATER. The Diminutive" Government of Ilaytl Grants Germany's Demands. Port Au Prince, Dec. 9. It is un derstood the question of indemnity de manded by Germany has been settled, and all demands of that country have been agreed to by the government of Hayti in the face of display of force made by Germany and under threat of bombardment of the defensive works of the port unless the demands were agreed to within eight hours. The first nart of the settlement took place at 6 o'clock last night, when the I Haytian flag formally saluted the Ger man flag.

Once more the children of Nancy Allison McKinley have gathered about her couch, made sacred by her tenacious strugggle against death. Tho reunion is com plete. The president arrived before the death angel made his visit. In the little upper room at the McKinley liompstpiid there was a scene almost too sacred for pen to write.

DOWN TO REAL WORK Senate and House Attend to Actual Bus iness Money Takes Oath of Office. Washington, Deo. 9. A new mem ber, in II. DeSoto Money, of Missis sippi, was introduced in the senate to day, and, after mime brief criticism of the form of his credentials, tho oath of office was administered to him. During the session, 108 bills, many of which were private, pension meas ures, were introduced, iu addition to several joint resolutions and some sen ate resolutions. . A.u interesting contest for precedence in consideration of Lodge's immigra tion bill and the proposed legislation to coi.fer authority upon the president to act for the protection of the govern ment's interest at the sale of the Kan- gu8 Pacific was pending at the close of j the session. Tho probability is that it will bo amicably arranged before the j senate convenes tomorrow. The session of the house today, though it lasted but two hours, wit nessed a very lively skirmish over the Question of distributing the president's message to the various committees clothed with jurisdiction over the sub jects dealt with. The conflict of au thority came between the ways and means committee and the banking and currency committee. The battle raged all along the line. During the day Grosvenor of Ohio fired the first gun .against the civil service law, and this also brought the friends and enemies of that measure into action. Johnson of Indiana, in a ringing warning, de clared that if a bill to emasculate the civil sei vice law was passed, it would meet the presidential veto. Eventually Dingley, in deference to the opposition of the members of tho banking and currency eommittee.agreed to a modification of the order of dis tribution, so as to send to the ways and means committee all matters relating to the "revenues, tho bonded debt of ' the country and the treaties affecting the revenues." The resolution was then adopted. After the session Chairman Walker claimed he had won a decisive victory, and that his committee, under the or der, would have jurisdiction of a meas ure, as lie expiainen u, to couven greenbacks into gold certificates. But members of the ways and means com mittee insisted that the changes of verbiage in the order would not affect their jurisdiction, and that a measure such as the president suggested, if in troduced in the house, would be re ferred by the speaker to their commit tee. 

MESSAGE SUITS SPANIARDS. McKlnley's Cuban Attitude Is Entirely Satisfactory. New York, Dec. 9. A dispatch to the Tribune from Havana says: President McKinley's message is re ceived quietly. Satisfaction is felt in official circles over the statement that the recognition of either belligerency or independence is not justifiable under present conditions. The credit which the president gives for conducting the war on humane principles and for im proving the conditions of the reconcen tradoes will strengthen Captain-General Blanco in carrying out his policy. The official feeling may be summar ized in the statement that the govern ment does not now fear the embarras ment which come from action by tho United States before instructions from Madrid could be carried into effect. The hint of ultimate intervention causes some uneasiness and discussion has already arisen over what is meant by "reasonalfi time," but palace offi cials do not interpret it as likely to prevent the application of autonomy within the time needed for carrying out the detail of the system as directed from Madrid. Autonomists, reformists and conserv atives who support Sagasta and Blanco will make the message the basis of a movement for the early union of all .parties to uphold the hands of the gov ernment in its colonial policy. Com mercial interests are pleased with the 'pacific tone of the message, though not taking it as a conclusive settlement. Fired a Uullet Into His Brain. Butte, Mont., Deo. 9.

LOCKS IT TIE DALLES The Government Proposes to Push the Work. CANAL WILL BE SPEEDILY DUG Kastem Washington and Idaho Are In terested In the Project-The ltoat Hallway Experiment. Washington, Dec. 7. Further in formation respecting the proposed canal and locks for the channel at the dalles is to the effect that it is proposed to push the work with a deal of rapidity T, ,.,..,,.,, Fystem 'and modern methods of excavation and building have made it clear that years need not be spent upon a work of this character. If the contract for improving the Co lumbia by a small channel at the dalles is adopted it will no doubt be stipulat ed that the work must be done with; rapidity. Heretofore Ort'gon has as sumed control over the proposed im provement at this place. Eastern Washington and Idaho, it is now said, will take a hand in the matter, and will not consider the Columbia river wholly an Oregon stream. Upper Co lumbia river interests begin to preBS upon the Washington and Idaho con gressmen, and make them feel the need of doing something to secure the water outlet to the Pacific ocen w itlmut in terruption. A theory which has been supplement ed on to some extent here in Washing ton is the fact that certain engineers who approved the boat railway scheme wanted an experiment of this kind tried for the purpose of influencing other works in the United States, both of a public and a private nature. It is also said that engineers are somewhat accommodating, and are not very anxi ous to go contrary to the wishes of con gressmen who push particular schemes. Engineers who have gone contrary to what senators and. representatives have wanted, have been subject to severe criticism, and this they do not fancy any more than other people. It must be acknowledged also that while the boat railway scheme has re ceived the indorsement of many emi nent engineors, it has also been some thing of a laughing-stock, and way down deep the leading engineers of the army never believed that congress would authorize it, or that a boat rail way would be built. It is one of the subjects that they always smiled about and would raise their eyebrows with a look of amusement when asked for a serious opinion upon the project. The greatest drawback to the boat railway, as always stated frankly by some of tha engineers, was that it would cost $80, 000 a year to maintain it, and that no one could tell how much would eventu ally be spent for repairs and break downs. The canal project has always been most favorably considered, and it looks as if that was to be the improve ment for that portion of the Columbia river. The secretary of the interior has ap proved patents to the Oregon & Cali fornia Railroad Company, of lands amounting to 3,851 acres in the Rose burg land district. NEW RAILROAD RECORD. . I'nina Faciflc Makes the Fastest Time iu the West. Omaha, Neb., Dec. 7. Celebrating its new birthday, the new Union Pa cific ha9 taken two more falls out of Father Time and has set a pace for fast running that will likely stand in the West for some time. Three record breaking spurts in one week is its rec ord. The first was done last Tuesday. At that time, a 520-mile run was made at the rate of 62) miles an hour, with a 100-mile dash at the rate of 68.2 milt's an hour. 'Yesterday, the fast mail was again late in Wyoming, and was danced across the Nebraska plains at a rate that makes Tuesday's run look slow. It covered 42 milei from Sidney to Julesburg, in 88 minutes; 81 miles, from Julesburg to North Platte, in 71 minutes; 60 miles, North Platte to Lex ington, in 60 minutes; 35 miles, Lex ington to Kearney, in 33 minutes, and a final dash of 42 miles, from Kearney to Grand Island, in 36 minutes, or 70 miles an hour. The 261 miles from Sidney to Grand Island was made in 238 minutes, an average of 65.6 miles an hour. From Grand island to umatia the speed was ordinary, the lost time having been made up Today the Union Pacific brought a theatrical company on a special train from Julesburg to Council Bluffs, 294 miles, in 286 minutes. From this must be deducted five minutes for changing engines at Grand Island; four minutes by a Missouri Pacific train on the crossing at Petrel, and necessary Blowing up through Omaha, and a slow run over the Missouri river bridge. The actual running time of the train was 275 minutes, an average of 63.6 miles an hour. Nickerson, Kan., Dec. 7. -While temporarily insane, Mrs. M. E.

WYMAN'S REPORT. Danger of the .Importation Cholera. of Aslatle Washington, Dec. 7. Surgeon-General Wyman, of the marine hospital service, has submitted his annual re port to Secretary Gage. It shows that during the fiscal year ended June 80, 1897, the total number of patients treated at hospitals and the dispensaries connectetd with the service was 61,477. Although the total number of patients treated was 673 in excess of thoso treat ed during the previous fiscal year, the expenditures were $538,5i'6, which .is . $21,000 less than tho previous year. The number of iminiirrants inspected by officers of the service at the various ports aggregated 233.327. The surgeon general says: "The necessity of legislation to secure proper shelter for deck crews on West mi waters.' to which my attention was t ailed in tho last report, was met by the get of congress requiring every steam ! "boat upon the Mississippi river and its I tributaries to furnish a place for the crew with protection from the weather. This subject is one that has long en- gaged the attention of the marine hos pital surgeons, who have made frequent j reports thereon, and this action of con- gress will be productive of much relief, ! ulthongh the act docs not take effect j until June 30, 1898. To meet the j growing demands for the service, new regulations have been prepared, and will shortly be issued. " The surgeon-general invites attention to the excellent work by officers of the corps during the recent visitation of yel low fever in the South. Officers were assigned to infected districts, and, al though a number of them were not im mune to yellow fever, nevertheless they responded with alacrity and performed their duties with judgment and effi. tiency. Three officers contracted yellow ever and one lost his life by accident n the line of duty. TROLLEY CARS COLLIDED. Three Persons Killed and h Score lu- juied Near Detroit. Detroit, Dec. 7. Two suburban cars, carrying some 20 passengers, and both running at a speed of 25 miles an hour, collided on the Detroit & Oakland elec tric railroad, at 1 o'clock this afternoon. Three men were instantly killed and a score of persons injured, several of them seriously. Tho dead are: John Savage, superintendent of the road; Charles M. Whitehead, motor man; John Kelly, of Detroit, book agent. A dozen others were more or less seriously injured. The exact cause of the accident is not yet known. According to the schedule, a car leaves Detroit and Pontiao every hour, and there are three sidings along the road. Today the cars were behind lime. Tho one bound southward for Detroit had passed an outbound car at a switch two miles from Pontiac, the crew apparently being ignorant of the fact that another outbound car was ap proaching them less than two miles away. The weather was foggy and the rails slippery from sleet. The collision occurred near a gravel pit half way be tween Pontiae and Birminghay, at the foot of two steep grades, down which the oars ran at full speed. The cars were driven half through each other, and were crushed to pieces. Had it not been for the stout con struction of the cars, both of which were new, it is doubtful whether any of the occupants would have escaped alive. As it was, nearly all of the 14 passen gers in the southbound car suffered some injury. Some of the injured were taken to farmers' houses, others were brought to city hospitals. The Matter Arranged. Washington, Dec. 7. It was official ly announced at the White House today, on the return of the president to Wash ington, that Governor John Grigg", of New Jersey, has been tendered and has accepted the office of attorney-general of the United States, which will be vacated by the nomination of Attorney General McKenna to bo associate jus tice of the United States supreme court. It has not yet been settled when Gov ernor Griggs shall assume his new office, but it is probable that the date will be about the beginning of the new year. mil Give Spain a Trial. New York, Dec. 7. A special to the Herald from Washington says that con gress will concur with the wishes of President McKinley and give a trial to Spain's new scheme of autonomy. The Herald poll of the senate and house j shows the following results: Senators against action, 42; senators who favor, but do not expect action, 24; enators for immediate action, 9; sena tors noncommittal or not seen, 14; rep resentatives against action, 178; repre sentatives for action, 159; representa tives noncommittal or not seen, 18. Burned to the Water tine. Chicago, Dec. 7. -The steamer George W. Morley, of Cleveland, was burned to the water's edge on the beach at Evanston tonight. Her crew of 18 men got ashore without trouble. The Morley was bo Jnd from Milwaukee to Chicago without cargo, and when off Evanston a lamp exploded in the engine room. Before the pumps could be started the fire was beyond control, and the boat was beached, the crew wading ashore. The Morley was a wooden iteamer, and was valued at $35,000.
