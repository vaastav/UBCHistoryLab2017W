Governor Nor ris, in response to the petition of a majority of legislators. ft!ed with him yesterday today issued a proclama tion granting the prayer of the peti tioners. The legislature is also asked to make provision for maintenance of a bureau of publicity during, the en suing year. the aplproprliation for which was omitted for the year of 1910 frtm the general appropriation bill. The full text of governor Norris proclamation follows: The Proolamation. "Whereas. a large number of mIem hers of the, legislative assembly have requested me that the legislature be convened in extraordinary session for the purpose of making such additional appropriation as will permit the use of Montana stone In countruction of additions to the Montana state capitol. while others have requested that an extraordinary session be convened to the end that there may be an addi tional appropriation dto permit the largest possible use of Montana ma terials in construction of said addi tions; and all members so requesting have agreed that they will attend and serve at such session without cost to the state; and "Whereas, the act authoriaing the construction of the said additions (Sec. 14. Chapter 6s, session law of 1906). limits the price which may be paid for Montana materials to a sum for which materials of like kind and char acter may be procured elsewhere; and the amount so appropriated in said act is not sufficient to enable the state board of examiners to use Mon tana material exclusively in the said addition: and "Whereas, certain Montana producers of and dealers in materials entering Into the construction of the said ad CRI ICS CRITIICIlED S SEVERELY FAULT-FINDING EXECUTIVE OF FICIALS FLAYED BY TWO REPRESENTATIVES. Wasahilgton, Dec. 17.-lJonunolation of offlclals of the executive depart ments of the government who criticise without just cause was the subject of a speech by Representative Mann and another speech of a similar tenor by Rtepresentatise Fit.gerald (New York). who said: "A certain distinguished ufflcial" was responsible therefor. for the bad ex ample he had set for his subordinates enlivened an otherwise dull session of the house today. It was understood generally that Mr. i-'ltgerald had former President Roosevelt in mind. The District of Columbia appropria tion bill was read, but was not put upon its passage and will again be taken up Monday. Some saving was effected by reducing appropriations for increase in salaries for district officers or by eliminating altogether paragraphs making provision for new offices. Rep resentative Macon (Arkansas) again assumed the ro!e of the "watch dog of the treasury" and made points of order against several sections of the bill and not wholly without success." Rather unexpectedly the house agreed to insert in the bill an appro priation of $17.000 for playgrounds for the children of the district. The senate was not in seeslon today.

"Whereas, there is a strike in prog rcss at the Bedford quarries, where stone would likely be obtained by the contractors to whom the contract for the construction of the additions have been awarded, which strike might cause delay in securing stone, and might also render 'the use of Bedford stone undesirable; and "Whereas, the eleventh legislative assembly, through an evident over sight, failed to provide an appropria tion for the maintainence of a pub licity department of the state bureau of agriculture, labor and industry for the year 1910. by reason ,,f which oversight said department will be forced to discontinue in the coming year the very effective and excellent work it is doing for the advertising of the resources of Montana unless provision is made by the legislature for its continuance. "'Now, therefore. I. Edwin L. Norris, governor of the state of Montana, do hereby convene the Eleventh legislative assembly in extraordinary session, at Helena. the capital of said state, at 12 o'clock noon on Monday, the twenty-seventh day of December A.

LEGAL BATTLE OVER WEALTH OF KING LEOPOLD IMMINENT Will of Deceased Monarch Leaves One Million to Eact of His Three Daughters and This Practical Disinherit ance of Them, as It Is Termed, Is Taken to Signi fy the t3eginning of a Great Struggle Over the Late Ruler's Immense Fortune- Prince A I be r t Becomes King on ThursJly, Next. Brtu sset. Lk)c. 17.--The entire king dom of Belgium mtourns its departed ruler. Leopold II. Courts. schools and theaters are c:used, parliament and the municipal council have adjourned and flags are at half-mast in every city, town and village of the kingdom. Under the constitution, affairs of the nation are in the control of the cabinet until Prince Albert .|ill take the oath of succession next Thursday, the day after the funeral of his uncle. An offi clal decree issued today lauds King Leopold's career and dec!ares his cre ation of the Congo Independent state was unique in history. "Posterity will jtdge Leopold a great king with a grand reign." it says. The body of Leopold remains in the mortuary chamber of "The Palms." To morrow night it will be removed to the palace In Brussels. The face of the dead ruler will not be exposed again to public view. The filing of the will of King Leo pold today shows that he d!vided $3,000.000 between his three daughters. Princess Lou)se. Princess Stephanie and Princess Clementine. This prac tical disinheritance of his children sig nified the beginning of a great legs; battle to obtain the king's wealth, sim ilar to that which ensued on the death of their mother, Queen Henrietta. Great Wealth. The exact amount of Leopold's for tune probably never will be revealed. Senator Winer. the king's friend and confidential legal adviser, told the As sociated Press today that Leopold turned over a large portion of it to the Baroness Vaughan and heir chil dren and created a stock company of his estates to forestall a possible raid upon it by the Princesses Louise and Stephanie or their creditors. ,CONFEDERATION OF REPUBLICS IN CENTRAL AMERICA PLANNED ,,," .

Proof of this is offered to the minds of Central American diplomats here in the sudden disappearance of Dr. Luis Anderson. Dr. Anderson was here as special representative of Costa Rica and was the candidate of Mexico for president of the proposed "United States of Central America." He left on' receipt of a telegram and it was learned today that his deti nation was Cartago.

At the conclusion of today's hearing Judge Lewis an nounced that a prima face case had already been made against a part of the defendants and all motions for I non-sutts would be overruled. The suit is directed against the offl cers and directors of the Union Land company. N. G. Koser. a farmer of Iowa City. Iowa. declared that Frank McDonough. Sr.. an attorney for the defendant company. said to him: "Unless we get these thousands of acres of coal lands Into the hands of innocent purchasers for the benefit of the Union Land company we will not onfy'lose the whole thing. but we are going to get into litigation with the government and you stockholders (Koser being a stockholder) of the company, may have to go to the pen itentIary with the offlcers. The filings have been irregular and we must cover up." . Koser said he had betn lured into the deal In 1902 but did not suspect its fraudulent nature until two years ago. "The promoters told us they had obtained the land from the entrymen and in an irregular way." Koser add ed. S. K. Stevenson, an attorney of Iowa City. caused a sensation by de claring that two of the defendants had been advised by a "minor offi clal" at the land office at Washing ton to change the name of the com pany and "bury it deep to help the fraud."

This action was taken today is the result of a telegram receivi-d from the United Stales consulate at Managrmu . stating that. inasmuch as Zeays in his message reaigning thie preslitwbcy has made unpleasant referenti i Americana and owing to a report cur rent in that city that civilian ni herents of Zelaya hal been armed with daggers. cltlaena of the United Staten there had appealed to the coni aulate for protection. Another telegram frimti the Ame rs can consulate at Managua says that it is currently rumored there that. when Madrls arrives in Manaigu. pre aumably tomorrow. Zelaya will formmr ly surrender his office to the natuimmnl assembly, and that that bmtmy already has received instruction from Zelaya to cast ita vote for Irnas as hirealdetit of NIcaragua. This rumor Is directly at variance with the undseratanding that Nadrid would receive the support. not only of Zelaya himself. but oil hies faction. The conclusion of the t nited States officers at Managua is that, by the selection of Irlas, Zelayn wmulki ctillt dominate. Change of Front. Zelaya's change of,.front is a matt.r of no surprise here. it betug known that both Irias and Madril havet long been regarded as Zelaya's willing tt As and it has been asmpected for .ome time that Irlas was really Zelaya's first choice for the presklency and Madria second.
