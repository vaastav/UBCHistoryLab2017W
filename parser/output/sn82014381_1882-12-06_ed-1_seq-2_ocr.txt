The Tariff Commission has submitted its report, and it is said to recommend reduc tions in the tariff averaging '2"> per cent. Of v une it ie not poßfeible in the absence of details to say w! at these reductions amount to, but if we may judge from the known character of the Commission, the ultimate purpose is to throw a sop to the tariff reformers, and thus save the bulk cf the imposts. The reductions announced may, when the actual facts are at hand, prove to be a mere blind. It is more likely that this is the case than that a Commission packed in the interests of Protection should pfopose a genuine re form measure. But it is to be expected that the report of the Tariff Commission will not cut a very important figure in the coming deliberations of Congres?. The Republicans have no doubt learned some thing from the late election?, and among other things they have had it borne in upon them that the people demand a thor ough revision of the tariff. Besides, if the Republicans are afraid to tackle that ques tion they know that the Democrats will come after them and make all the capital. And therefore they are liktly to favor a larger reduction than '_'."> per cent. AND NOW FRANCE TAUNTS US. The weakness of our navy exposes us to taunt aud insult whensver we undertake to assume the dignity cf a great nation in the councils of Europe. A mero rumor that the United States Government has addressed some remonstrance to Trance is enough to call forth sneering comments from the Fretch preßS upon the impotence of our navy, and we are reminded that France could destroy all our seaport towns. Of course the fact that this is true does cot make i; the more pleasant ; but we must " grin and bear it," so long as Congress re fuses to take any practical measures to reor ganize the navy and pltce it upon a re spectable footing. A Gf.oroia editor, by a prtat effort, aroge early tme morning to view the comet, and this is tlie re markable result of the inspiration he breathed in the fresh morning air : "Grand in its pyrotcchuical display, illimitable m the vastness ol its immensity, it rtniitirii us wlat a preat country we live in, that can boast of such products, impotsible to the cfl: te despotisms of the £a»t, and the cold and barren re gions of the bleak and frozen North."

THE 

PROSPECT FOR CIVIL SERVICE REFORM The President has given in his adhesion to the principles of Civil Service reform, and it remains to be teen whether Congress will act upon his recommendation. The fact that public opinion, as the President states, has been already shown to demand this reform, unfortunately does not of necessity secure compliance with that opinion. It is evident that the American people are heartily tired of the spoils system, but it is equally true that our representative sy stern rests upon that method of conducting politics. Tne diffi culty therefore which presents itself to every Coagrees is always the same. Men are scarcely ever elected to Congress with out being compelled to make a great many promises in return for assistance. Almost every member of Congress goes to Wash ington weighted down with obligations to political friends, and a very large percent age of these political friends are men who would have but a poor prospect if they were compelled to re'.y upon their success in competitive examinations, for obtaining office. We loDg ago pointed cut the very serious character of the difficulties in the way ef reform, arising from this Btate of things. However much the people may demand reform, the men who can alone enact it are hampered and embarrassed from the outset, and almost pledged against any such measure. The experience of every I'resident has been identical with President Arthur's. Tney all lind them- Belves overwhelmed with the importunities of office-seekers. The more conscientious they are the sooner are they worn out with the ungrateful labor. Bat thus tar no man has been found strong enough and patient enough to resist the temptation to get rid of the respontibility by allowing the mem bers of Congress to control appointments. The kind of men who have been given prominence in national politics through the spoils system are not the kind of men to throw down the ladJer by which they have mounted. Indeed, to ask them to do away with their own patronage is to ask them to renounce all ambition, and to re tire from politics, for there are very few ot them who could secure a re election if they had no army of official claijueurs at their back to watch their interests in their districts, and to " arrange " all the party machinery with a view to the accom plishment of tbeir desires. And this is the real difficulty in the situation. Congresa has come to be dependent upon the spoils system. A generation of politicians have been educated and trained under it. They do sot understand any other methods. Like poor old Thurlow Weed, they believe it is the beet system in existence. A i.il so it is for them ; for under a rational system they would have to devote their energies aud capacities to productive industry of some kind, and would be forced to leave politics to those who were able to rely upon their own merits. But the Congress of to day \i a body which understands nothing but the epoils system, and which is too old to learn. The question therefore is, whether the fear of public opinion will be powerful enough to overcome the fear of political suicide, with these men. It must be a lmitted that their position ia extremely embarrassing. In fact, to use a vulgar but forcible expression, they are " between the devil and the deep sea." If they do nothing about Civil Service reform they must apprehend that their constitu ents will retire them into private life. If they do anything about Civil Service re form they know that they will be inca pacitated for re-election. In theee pecu liar and discouraging circumstances, our Congressmen cannot Le expected to ex hibit much enthusiasm. Aad the position is a bad one for the country also, for the problem before it is how to induce & body which lives by and through abuse, to abol ish that abuse. It is truo that there are in the present Congress an unusual number of members who have already been defeated, and who may therefore be disposed to shed a certain spleador over their exit from public life by assuming a virtue foreign to their natures. This is one hope, though we must c:nfes3 that it is a feeblo one. But if nothing is done at this session for reform, how can it be expected when the Democrats come into power ? The Itopub licans may be said, in the words of the English I'oet Laureate, to have "dropped "off gorged" from the public treasury. But the Democrats are faint with famine, and thtir eyes gleam hungrily as they scent the prey. Is it to these starved and greedy politicians that the country must look for relief ! The Democrat?, moreover, are not com. mitted to Civil Service reform as the Re publicans are. Yet there is one avenue of hope even here. The Administration will remain Republican, and the President cm, if he chooses, keep the Democratic Congressmen from the public crib by refus ing to let them dictate any appointments. Under the smart of such a disappointment, and from motives of revenge, they might be induced to vote for the abolition of the Federal patronage altogether. Whether the I 'resident will so act as to encourage them in that tendency is, however, very problematical. No Executive has cvor seemed to care greatly for contests with Congress, and Arthur may prefer a qaiet life to the doubtful public advantages of a course which would be open to miscon struction. On the whole, therefore, it appears probable that unless Civil Service reform is established at the session which has just been opened, the country will have bo wait for it some time longer. (); course it is possible that the Republicans may suddenly aad unexpectedly develop a noble spirit of self sacrifice, and piss the Pendle ton or some other bill of the kind. This is possible, but we are constrained to ad mit that we do not regard it as highly probable. And yet if the Republicans do nothing in the premises this seasioc, it will be almost hopeless to thii.k of rehabilita' ing the party in time for the next Presi dential election. THE 

GARFIELD PHYSICIANS. The statement of Dr. U'.iss as to the dis- proportionateness of the amount offered him, with the income he sacrificed in ordtr to attend upon President Gartield, may be a good ground for scoffing commen*, but we fail to perceive it if it is so. It appears to us that in euch a case it was the clear duty of the committee appointed to audit the claims of the physicians, to ascertain what their services were worth ; and that no other means of ascertaining this could i>e resorted to than an examination of their practice. If a physician is making §10, --000 a year, and he is called in to attend a President, and thus loses three months' time and revenue, and has his connection broken up, he ought, upon any business consideration, to be paid not only for the actual loss of revenue incurred, bet for the farther injury resulting freni the breaking up of his clientage. Now if the representations of Dr. Bliss as to his income fre-n his practice are correct, and we pre tzms that there is so reason to doubt hi 3 integrity, it follows that the sum offered him by Congteeq is altogether inadequate, and that he is fully jus'.itied in feeling wronged and insulted by the offer. This remark of course &ppUes with equal or greater force to the cases of l>rs. Agnew and Hamilton, for their practice is very n.uch n.ore lucrative than that of Dr. Bliss, and they must have incurred correspondingly greater losses. In matters of this kicd legislative bodies are very apt to exhibit a mean parii. mony, and UDcler pretense of guarding the public interests they not infrequently com mit seriou3 wrongs. Considering the wan ton and lavish recklessness with which Congress has been tlingiug about the money of the people in the Pension Arrears swin dle, in the Pv'.ver and Harbor bill, and in the tariff, this pretense of economy in the matter of Uattield's physicians is gro tesquely inconsifct-.nt and abaurJ. If, how ever, through the refusal of Congress to do justica to the physicians who attended upon the late President, the estate of the deceased should have to bear the expenses, it would be a nation il disgrace. And yet, after the spectacle of the dishonest and shameless retention of the Japanese In demnity Fund, even thia ought not to sur prise any one. 

HERE'S WISDOM. The comments of the London press upon the President's Message have a very odd flavor. They suggeat to us Professor Z j)l --ner'a puzzling proposition of the way three-dimecsicaal things would appear to a being living in four- dimensional space. Our English critics really do not seem to poetess the faintest conception of Ameri can politics or affairs. From the Timen down they exhibit what c rlain theolo gians call "invincible ignorance." Why I'rcßident Arthur's Message should have appeared to theae I.jnbsys a clear indica tion that the Republican party has g^ne tc the dogs, it is absolutely impossible to con ceive. It is equally impossible to under stand what the T&mn means by saying that the President has "placed himself at the head of the stalwart party, and sue "ceeded in detaching from the Republican "connection the reformers and independ "enta who, if few in numbers, are amone " the moefremineiit for capacity and char acter." Few, in Dumber! We wonder what Judge Fitger will thick of that ta pient observation. But the whole of the English comments are mysterious to the last degree, and "wonderful past all whooping," as an Elizabethan writer phraeea it.

The trus way to repair it is to in vigorate the system through the medium of imprcved digestion, secretion, and the estab lishment of a regular habit of body, three results invariably accomplished by the use of Etostetter's Stoaatoh Bitters, which insures the thorough ronver.'ion of the food into pure, nourishing blood, frora which tha nerves, in common with every other part ot tue bodily econorr.y, gather vigor, the grand prerequi site of health.
