JOHN IinrniT Zürn?. Editor. SOUTH BEND NEWS-TIMES SUNDAY EDITORIAL PAGE 3 RECOGNIZING THE RUIN. A Hamburg business man, writing In the leipsic eucM' Narhrichten, draws a mournful picture of the bUM.-.-.; disaster that the war has brought upon Ger many. He is not deceived try the fal'e glow of Ger many's territorial conquests. He recognizes that tho.se gaii.v art- possibly balanced by Germany's loss of her colonics, and ' rtalnly counterbalanced by her loss of world-trad. "We ruu.-t not clo our eyes," he says, "to the fact that Ungland ha in the main achieved her war aim. Uven o.;r v- ini-rful military situation in Europe does net alter this. Our merchant marine, our commerce, with th' world, have been bo thoroughly destroyed that u- u;ut. literally start from the beginning again, and dc-ad-s of strenuous work will not euffice to rebuild what h 's been destroyed in these three years." He d-c!an-s that the nearest blow wad the oustin? of German tr.. b- from Chin- aiid South America. He h is . :i p -'a still more cause to grieve since writing las artwle, by our government's blacklisting of 1,400 llrrnian or pro-German firms in latin-America. He tays truly enough: "The German business man who, after peace Is de ilued. goes out into the world, will find ruins every where, and if he attempts to rebuild them he will bo pre-, f-ntt d by a wall of enmity. Not ven the return of the colonics would help us much, for they used to har.'lle only c small part of our world trade." He quotes a German economic expert to the effect that Germany's foreign trade, under normal develop ment, would have surpassed England's for the first tlma this year. That is to Ray, if there- had been no war, Germany would today have the greatest foreign com merce of any nation on earth. In the usual German fashion, he blames all this on th" arch-find, England, with a little added bitterness for England's Yankee allies. The idea is that this in calculable loss, which is destined at best to cripplo Germany economically for many decades, is the result of a Jtriti.-h conspiracy to lure Germany into war and then steril her trail". In view of the general Intelligence shown by the writer, it doesn't seem likely that ho himself believes this childish fable. The facts speak for themselves. They constitute, on the score of business alone, a crushing Indictment cf the G'-rman militarists. It is perfectly clear that Ger many hod her "place In the sun," as attested by her own eccnomic experts, and that that place had noth ing to do with colonics or conquest of her neighbors. Enibarkinr on a tremendous freebooting adventure, the has forfeited the blessings she possessed. The war will end, at best, with German trade gone, German shipping rone. German industries prostrated. German man-power exhausted, German credit ruined. Germany's place for decades to come will be in the shade th:. nks to her brutal attempt to rob her neigh bors of their share of sunshine. THAT "CENTRAL" COMMITTEE. The president's recommendation, submitted in his recent message, that a central committee of congress take charge- of t lie question of appropriations, brings the c. no try clove to that "long felt want" called the budget system, provided congress takes favorable ac tion. Tiie president says: "And I I t; that the members of the house of representatives will permit me to express the opinion that it will be impossible to deal in any way but a very wasteful and extrava gant fashion with the enormous appropria tions of the public moneys which must con tinue to be made, if the war is to be properly sustained, unless the. house will consent to re turn to its former practice of initiating and preparing all appropriation bills through a single committee, in order that responsibility may ho centered, expenditures standardized and made uniform, and waste and duplication as much as possible avoided." Unless those who clearly tee this need repeat and support the president's appeal, it is apt to be lost. Ls there any other "bit" which you can do which will help the country more at this time than to support this ippeal? The democratic platform of 1916 pledged this reform. Chairman J. J. Fitzgerald of the appropria tions committee has been pleading for it. Only two things stand in the way: Committee jeal ousies in congress, which will fade away If the public demands action, and the republican belief in an execu tive budget, which fortunately need not interfere with recing the tremendous gain which would result from following the president's proposal. To increase the buy ing efficiency of billions being spent, to stop delays, to enhance our fighting efficiency and to save hun dreds of millions otherwise wasted are certain re-s-jlts of acting promptly upon the president's demand for centra! analysis and comparison of appropriation jstimatcs. The puMir should Insist upon it.

The Miraculous Beginning CHRISTENDOM approaches the anniversary of its birth each year in the light of iU founder celebrating in realization what the an cient poets celebrated in anticipation, centuries before the advent of the Christ-child. His coming was not unsung. His early ar rival had been heralded to every race and in every tongue. He was to be a "Prince of Peace" to a world already grown weary as a world of wars. In ali the Bibles of all the lands had been inscribed the hope of a coming Avator the descent of "the Divine Child to poise the shaken world." The Babe in the manger had long since been foreseen beheld by the Aryan poets in visions "arising out of the hallow lotus-flower" that floated upon the waters of the mother seas. The ancient Vedas saw Him from the beginning "a golden child reclaiming the earth and sky." The poet-prophets of Israel looked down the centuries and pronounced his name "Wonderful!" The magi of Persia, so tradition runs, also awaiied the Avator, and for untold ages the twelve searchers of the skies kept vigil watching for "the star in the east." And finally in the days of Herod the king, with Rome full occupant of the world saddle; when distrust, dissatisfaction and unrest frus trating every mind; when there was expectancy everywhere, and all faces were turned upward the expected, it seems, unexpectedly happened. It was in the month of March, or thereabouts, an the story goes the unpaintable lily in full bloom. The angel Gabriel, in Galilee, near Nazereth, talked to the Virgin Mary and ere long we find her kneeling at the door of little Beth lehem. There was a rush of wings, a sounding of trumpets, the angels sang, arid the seraphs dipped their feet in the gray sunrise of a new era. :Je j: :fc 'Jp. s-e FULFILLMENT of poetic prophecy! "He came unto His own and His own received Him not" in predecession of present-day higher criticism, semi-authenticated; censuring it all as an attempt to humanize the deity or deify humanity. Spiritism maintains that the miraculous birth of the Son of Nazareth can be scientifically explained, but materialism says, "Never" and defies the mystery. Materialism asserts that it is a myth, a subterfuge, borrowed from Buddhism similarities to which were circulated in India, Persia, Asia Minor and Greece, several centuries before. When a king's unwedded daughter, or some maid of high degree, gave birth to a child, the father was always pronounced a god or a demigod and such distinguished "sons of the gods" were held in high esteem from ancient times down through the middle ages. "Daughters of the gods" were similarly glorified. Everyone familiar with the beautiful mythology of classical antiquity is asked io re call, too, that these sons and daughters of the Greek and Roman gods often approached nearest to the highest ideals of humanity. It is the materialist's challenge comparative and critical theology, but the parents of Jesus were not of the kingly and queenly sort; just simple, earnest folk, not poor but neither rich, and without position, titles or proud pedigree, such as mythology licensed to employ "godfathers" to camouflage illegitimacy. Jesus never called himself the "Son of David." The attempt to make of Him a pretender to the Jewish throne was evidently worked out by theologians who did not believe, or perhaps had never heard of His miraculous birth. The line of David had died out centuries before, and many of the men named by Matthew and Luke, as His progenators, have never been heard of since or elsewhere than in their genealogical surveys, either in sacred or in profane history. Matthew climbs the genealogical tree to David, but Luke in his zeal stops not short of Adam, and then goes on to God, to prove his contention, but all this aside, the entire Christian faith is built upon the declaration that Joseph, the supposedly proved descendant of David, was not a blood relative of Jesus at all. He was a simple, honest, unpretentious man of middle age, intelligent enough that had he been the direct heir to the Jewish throne he doubtless would have known it, told of it, and would have been a "marked man" in the community. Neither the rulers of Rome, supreme in that hour, nor the high priests of Jewry, jealous of the Roman power, seemed to know of any lineal descendants of King David, and both would have been glad to have found one; the Romans that they might wipe him out, and the Jews that they might set him up. One of the big troubles with both the Romans and the Jews was, that the Royal Preacher proclaimed Himself and spoke in the lan guage of the spirit, while the Jews took Him literally and the Romans declined even to take either Him or the Jewish denunciation of him very seriously. TV 7HY seek to impose upon the Jews a kinship or a kingship, to which, so far as the logic of the records show, they are no more entitled V than are the Egyptians, the Syrians and the Greeks? The word Galilee, the name of the town where Gabriel visited Mary, means "mixed." It was a community of mixed nationalities Egyptians, Syrians and Greeks, as well as Jews, and with the Jews in the minority. Nothing is known of the genealogy of Mary, and the fathership of Joseph in relation to Jesus, once thrust aside, the Galilean may as well, so far as human blood goes, be of some other race as of the Jewish. Mary was a maid of Galilee. Besides, Jesus was never orthodox, as a Jew almost cerlainly would have been; was a born reformer of deeds and creeds, and thus, in the scale of the Jewry of that day, almost everything that the Jews weren't Indeed, he was quite a skeptic for his time; an infidel in his day this in the sense of modern orthodox definitions, as applied to those who non-conform to established customs and modes of thought, and are unfaithful to the popular acclaim. The Christian philosophy of life, as taught by the Nazerene, seems borrowed quite as much, if not more, from the Greek than from the Hebrew, and there are likelihoods that Mary was a Grecian girl and in the early training of her Son taught Him, at her knee, from Plato, Aristotle and Socrates, the lessons of her girlhood, much as the preceptors in the synagogues taught him from Moses, Solomon and the Psalms. This conflict of teaching is what brought on His clash with the priests in the synagogues at the age of twelve. Jesus a Jew? The genealogists, to establish His Jewry, will have to do so by way of Heavenor else find an unknown Jewish lover for Mary, as vivified by the higher criticism; a lover who deserted her at the critical moment, and thus forever forfeited his claim to immor tality. Of all men who have blundered, no man ever blundered more or blundered worse; sinking himself into oblivion, when otherwise he might have worn a crown of glory, quite equal to that of the Son and of the Mother. Had the fame and name of the Son been anticipated, doubtful if even Joseph would have disclaimed Him, yet both he and Mary dis avowed that marriage of love that would have made Joseph's fatherhood genuine. Indeed, Joseph, when he found that his wife was to become a Mother, was on the point of putting her away, but "an angel visited me in a dream," she pleaded, and something in his heart, whether from within or without, aroused his better nature, and, in the language of the cynic, it might be said, he determined to "grin and bear it." Spiritists believe in that dream; that God softened the heart of Joseph, even as He had hardened the heart of the Pharoah; and that, not the Son of King David but the Son of Universal God destined as man of the world and man of the people, to rejuvenate a fast de generating humanity, with the sprit of Heaven, was the immaculate conception, and the result, ?J Jl jj jjl 3C ?Jt THAT some omnipotent power controls the affairs of this v,t rid is as certain as any fact of modern science. On this point, Moses the creatorist, and Spencer, Huxley, Darwin, TyndalL and practically all of the evolutionists, clasp hands, back across the centuries. The deeds of time are governed as well as judged by the decrees of eternity. The caprice of fleeting existence, bends to the Immovable Omnipotence, which plants its foot on all ages, and has neither change of purpose, nor repose. Sometimes, like a lone star in the thick darkness of the night, it creeps along mysterious ways, but when the hour comes for man kind to pass into new life, unseen hands draw the bolts from the gates of futurity while Eternal Wisdom martials the great procession of men and nations, preparing their minds for the coming revolution, and those who plan resistance find themselves in conflict with the will of a Divine Providence, rather than with human or material devices. Jesus of Nazareth, conceived in Galilee, born in Bethlehem, reformer throughout Palestine, condemned at Jerusalem, crucified at Golgotha was just such a "Lone Star;" His birth a mystery, His life an inspiration, His death a calamitous bl&ssing, and with the whole history of humanity and the world written into them; Man of Sorrows and Man of Joys God's universe epitomized into flesh and blood. Acceptance of the immaculate conception of Jesus is no less sensible than belief in the existence of the Almighty Himself the rock upon which all atheistical science has gone to wreck; the hypothesis that science has been forced to recognize. If in the beginning, out of nothingness came forth a world, without a creator, without force, energy, power, evolving to the present high standard of harmonious nature, without intelligent design, then faith in Jesus as the Creature of an All Wise Creator is vain but otherwise the logic of events from the beginning until now confirms it. No one has ever attempted, with any degree of success, to live the Christ life whether He was human or of the Deity; just another little proof that there was something to Him a trifle more than extraordinary. If the question were asked, "is the religion of Jesus feasible in practical life?" the answer would need to be: "Nobody knows. It has never been tried." His was the religion of the Infinite and the finite has never yet measured up to the Infinite and never will, until there is such a new birth of Infinite spirit as makes them one; even as in Christ Jesus. .OBS FOR 

"NOT-ENEMY ALIENS." The c-mplojment of loreur.ers who are cally "enemy aliens" although thir hearts and minds loyal to the United States, i; forming a big problem in those cities where large numbers of such persons have been excluded from their forme- work by the dock and zone regulations. In New York city this problem his aimed meü proportion that it i-- taxing the r'srur es of th statt employment bureau, the mayor's advj.-i.ry omraltlee, the agricultural and industrial labor rchef and tho staU defense council clearing hous. .One chief difficulty in the way of loyal foreigners finding work when thty have been e.cludel from th tarred districts is a prejudice against them on th part of employers in othr sectims. Mr. Hessels, erc retary of the Iabor Kelief organisation, sums up th difficulty and puts in his plea for its solution. He says: "The point that I wish to put Tip to employers ii that there is no reason why there should be a prejudice against employing there people just because they a.m ejected from the waterfront and other barred districts. That does not stamp them as less lcyal to the United States or less able and reliable. The. majority of our applicants are people who have proved their va!n to employers threugh many years of trustworthy nr.d com petent service. The employers regret losing them, but they have been compelled to submit because of the.r nationality and war conditions." That is no plea for frankly disloyal workers nor for suspicious characters. It is for the loyal men and womeu of every city who by accident of birth must be classe I as enemies. Until they have, shown themselves unworthy they should be given an opportunity to continue work. Thre are plenty of jobs calling for workers that thcs people could fill: jobs in which they could do prac tically no harm even if thev wished. THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT'S CINEMA. France is getting out a series of government motion pictures. The "cinema" is being used to inspire con fidence and courage by showing how much Franco, has already accompllshrni and how her strength has increased rather than diminished during th?v0 tcrril ' years. The Pi-ench pictures begin with the recruit and carry him through all his training behind the lines, then his entrance into actual warfare, with the construction and occupation of trenches. The civilian's part la showTs too. The great factor! and warehouses where clothing, food and munitions arn made and stored, all phases of thq country's marvel ous development of its resources for tHe comfort ani aid of the fighting men, are there for the, French citize.i to see and approve. No such group of pictures would b complete with out views of the aircraft and aviators of which Franco has such right to be proud. Various types of machines are shown and all kinds of flying. At the beginning oi the war France had 150 aviators. Now there are manv thousands, and the machines have been Improved far beyond the machines of those days. The big guns, too, are shown. Ilert again Franc has steadily increased her might. The grms now i-i use make those of 1914 look like toys. It must be an impressive ricture. Franr was not discouraged. he knows what she haa accomplished and how well prepared she Is to do much rr.o?e. Never theless these pictures must be of great interest an I inspiration to the people, summing up as they do all the varied activities of France at war. They or un deniable testimony of French purpose and co'ra.g i:t the cause of liberty. May we not hope to have similar pictures of o-;r own soon, making the war real and Inspiring to th-: civilians at home? MILLIONS IN LIVE STOCK DESTROYED. Through the negligence of live-stock owners food animals valued at ? 20,000 were killed on the track- of the Central of Georgia railway during the nr.-t nir.o months of this year. According to a statement of th ice president and general manager of that road, I. SO: head of stock were needlessly wasted in this manner. the average value of which was aprroxlrnitely $1" to $11 per head. Fine dairy- cows and beef cattle wer- included, as well as hogs, sheep, g ose, etc. The stor of all the roads in the country is not told. During those nine months, one animal was killM for every mile of track on the Central of Georgia, ar.t if that figure an be accepted a. a bnis for estlmatir. -the loss for the entire country, the destruction (1 food animals on the roilv..y tracks of the United cute i during the first nine months of this year can be P'.t at 52,760,000, or SrS.oco for the whole year. That is a very f--rious loss to the country and iM allies at this time, when there is being ror.d-icfd a. nation-wide campaign fr U-e conservation of feewj, ;jt when each of us is being asked, to do his tit toar ! saving something to eat. Would It not be fair and right, for the owner? of live stw-k to keep their ra.ttl! withJ- range and away from the railroad tracks. whT they trespass to the ultimate ft of everyone?
