have construed ae an insult to the legislative branch There la to be a public outbreak of resentment and it will come noon The SenatorS are just 05 angry as their younger and more excitable brethren of the House but their indignation is not as much in evidence Over on the House side of the Capitol there was A buzzing of excitement in cloakrooms and committee rooms which lasted nil day When adjournment time came it had been pretty well agreed among the leaders Republican nnd Democratic that something ought to bo dono to make Mr Roosevelt understand that Congress did not Intend to sit

this afternoon Champ Clark the new Democratic leader in the House and SW gf Shorey of Kentucky ono of the foremost men of the Democratic side wnt to the Republican leaders and tod them flatly that the Democratic membership did not purpose to permit the Presidents reflections on Congress to pass unnoticed From that time on there were conferences which most of the big men on both sides of the House rarticipnted among them in addition to Clark and Shorter being Sereno F Payne John DaJrell and James A i Tawney the Republican floor leaders After talk is things over for a while they decided 0 ceo Speaker Cannon but a short con wtion with him convinced them that it niqht be undesirable to have the SpeaLer as the presiding officer of the House brought into the matter BO their subw uent conferences did not include Mr C ann n The Democratic iei4erstollie Repub lican leaders that they regarded aa pref erableto jemove whatever action Was decided on fmapy tinge of partisan V ship and for Uisf reason they were anxious to bring about nn agreement bqtwees both parties chamber so that solid V front might be presented in sh wing resentment of Mr Roosevelts attitude They Mid that it Republicans would not agree to join withthe Democrats In this the Democrats would go It alone and they intimated that if action ws Y taken by their side of the House without 1 the concurrence ot the Republicans it I would take the form of a resolution of censure of the President or at least of a protest against the language employed V hv him In his message particularly his statement that the chief argument in favor or a proviiion of law enacted last year curtailing tbs operations of the Secret Service was that Congressmen them alves did riot wish to be investigated and his suggestion generally interpreted M sarcastic that Congress might make n pedal exception in favor of itself so as prevent the use of Secret Service men in investigative Congressmen But the Democratic leaders foundthat i V he captains of the opposition were not inaympalhelio A decision to unite on tome form of expression of the Houses indignation was reached without trouble end after that the only difficulty was to determine jutt what was the beat thing to he done that would obtain the support of practically the entire membership of the House The idea of making formal protest was abandoned and after con siderable discussion it was decided not to adopt a suggestion which however WAS very favorably received that that portion ot the Presidents message re lating to the Secret Service should be re turned to him with an explanation of the reasons of the House for refusing to ro lf lve It From present prospect the leader will present to the House resolution assert I ing the dignity and the right of the Housa m matters of legislation A tentative agreement to do this waa reached when th conferences the leaders adjourned It was not Intended in this resolution to make a direct reference to what the President said in his message but to fcne naming on the President that the legislative branch of the Government it not to be lectured by the Executive and that it will not countenance by
