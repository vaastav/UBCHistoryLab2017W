At a meeting of the Board of Super visors yesterday, a road was on leivl to be viewed at San Joaquin. J. T. Gor don was appointed Justice of the Peace for AStIM. Ten culprits appeared before the Mayor yesterday. Four for assault and battery, any six* for partiality to to firewater; and yet people say times are dull. We acknowledge the receipt of an Invitation to the confirmation or Bar Mitzrah of the son of .Mr. and Mrs. Louis Polaski, on Saturday next at the Synagogue.

Treasurer. The telegraph brings us news of another of these fearful marine disas ters which occurs at interval. The second dispatch shows that the loss of life was not quite as great as at first supposed, but the extent of the calam ity is terrible to contemplate. The excursion of the Patrons of Hus bandry from Wilmington, via Los An geles, to TjOs Nietos takes place on Thursday. The round trip only costs a dollar* and excursionists will leave Wilmington at 8 a. Los Angeles at 9,15 and return at .1:45 p. M. from Los Nietos. Fisher has returned from San Fran cisco and brought with him a greater stock of goods than the space devoted to locals will permit us to describe. But h" describes them himself in an other part of this paper, and special at tention is called to his new announce ment. Read what he has to say. B. W. Conry, Court House Marshal, and an old journalist and correspond ent, leaves Los Angeles to-morrow on a prolonged visit to Temescal, to re cruit his health which has been failing for a long time. We trust he will rap idly regain it and come back complete ly restored to health. - . Kelly and wife were arrested yester day on a charge of arson. Hartlee expects to prove that they set tire to the house maliciously, and it is re ported that saturated rags, eamplune, oil etc., were found in the house near where the fire originated. The suspi cion that arson was intended arises from the fact that Kelly had insured bis place for $500 in the Liverpool Lon don and Globe, and effected a further insurance for a like sum with the State Investment, without giving no tice to the first named company. Should arson be proved against either man or wife, it will probably go very hard with them. Justices' Court. The following cases were before Justice Traftbrd, Dee. Ist : A warrant was issued for the arrest of Kelly et ux., charged with arson, „ to-wit: burning their dwelling house on First street, in this city. Complaint was made by Evorito Ho man against Robert Hyer for threat ening to commit bodily injury. The case was set for Wednesday,*.id De cember, at 2 P. M. John McDonald vs Sylvester Roe; Injury to property. Same vs Sylvester Roe; threatening to kill. Before Justice Gray: People vs, Rafael Lopez, Juan Are nas and Jesits Galindo; illegal horse racing and injury to property, The defendants were found guilty. Lopez and Arenas were fined $50 or 25 days in default; Galindo $10 or 5 days. People vs. M. J. Banks; complaint of Peter Lunney was filed charging de fendant with assault and threats of bodily injury. Our Fire Boys. On Sunday, at half-past 2 p. M., an alarm of tire was given. The boys dragged the engine out themselves without waiting for the horses, tore down First street, and did not pull up * until near the railroad crossing, when information was given that the fire was under control. Never was t here such a crowd of "blowers" in this world. The up grade took It out of them, and most of our boys looked as if they ought to be walked about and rubbed down before the next heat. Although the horses came up at this juncture, the foreman sent them back, thinking the boys might as well take the engine home themselves, and fin ish what they had begun so well. It Is Very creditable to Company No. 1 that, regardless of Sunday clothes,|ab senceof horses, etc., they hitched on and ran the machine themselves a half mile and repeat. Passenger List.

CENTRAL AMERICA. San Diego, Nov. 30. The Pacific Mail Steamship Ari zona arrived at 7 o'clock a. m. to-day from Panama, which port she left on the 18th instant with 84 cabin and 264 steerage passengers, 693 tons of freight and $73,000 in treasnre. She saw the Constitution on the 23d; on the 26th she spoke the Nevada, at Mazatlan. The Arizona brought ten passengers for this port and sailed at 9 o'clock A. M. for San Francisco. The Panama Star and Herald of the 18th instant says that the civil war in augurated on the sth of April has end ed. Correoso, with the consent of the existing Government, took refuge on the l\ S. steamer Benicia, and waited for the steamer to Costa Rica. The filibustering steamer General Sherman has been making war on Honduras and neighboring peaceful republics under American colors. She arrived at Aspinwall on the Bth in stant. The Government of Columbia ordered an investigation of her papers by the officials at Aspinwall, who failed to do their duty. Permission was asked of the Government of Pana ma for the Sherman to transfer her arms and ammunition to the Pacific Mail steamer Colon. It was refused, but nevertheless the transfer was made and they were reshipped to New York the same day. Capt. Cushing, com manding the U. S. steamer Wyoming, at Aspinwall, seized the vessel for using illegal ship papers and sailing under the nag of Honduras. It was proved she only possessed legal Amer ican papers. A prize crew from the Wyoming has taken charge ofthe ves sel*. Captain Cushing has applied to Washington for instructions regarding the Virginius. The same paper says the United States steamer Wyoming, Captain Cushing, sailed from Aspinwall on the morning of the 11th, for Santiago de Cuba, to look after American interests in connection with the Virginius. Captain Cushing is acting on instruc tions from the United States Consul ate at Kingston, Jamaica. The papers of the Virginius, when she left Jamai ca, were correct and in order, and as no blockade of the Cuban coast has been declared, she could be considered guilty of smuggling only, and only amenable for that offense. It is said the Virginius has been sunk at Santi ago de Cuba. Commander Harmony, U. S. Navy, with 250 men, is en route for San Fran cisco to join the Kearsage, now fitting for sea at Mare Island, per steamer Ar izona. George Dewer, an Englishman, and old resident of Punta Arenas, Costa Rica, has been shot by his servant. Robbery was the intention. Heavy rains had fallen at Panama and Aspinwall. It was feared the flood would wash away the Panama railroad; but it subsided without seri ous damage. On the 14th President Niera tam pered wRh the troops, hoping to dis solve the Assembly and assume dicta torship. He failed, was deposed, and fled. DonGregorio Miro was appoint ed President. Correspondence from Peru says the Government has appointed a commit tee to examine the accounts of expend iture in the various railways in pro cess of construction. Meigg's docu ments are faultless. His resources nre sufficient to complete his enterprise. Business is dull. 

FOREIGN NEWS. London, Dec. 1. Special dispatches to the morning papers report that the bombardment of Cartagena was continued on Satur day. There is great distress among non-combatants who have taken re fuge in the suburbs. The city is filled with wounded. Seventeen houses and the principal hospital have been des troyed. The government fleet re mains inactive outside the harbor. The Daily Telegraph says it would be premature to regard the Virginius difficulty as serious. The views of President Grant on the subject, as will appear in his message to Congress, are known. Dispatches from Cape Coast Castle report another engagement with the Ashantees, near Durquest, in which forty Englishmen ana native Auxili aries were killed or wounded. The Ashantees boldly attacked the British position at Abhracrampa, but were driven off after a hard fight with a loss of thirty. The British were pro tected and their loss was trifling. London, Dec. 1. The ship Trimountain arrived at Cardiff from New York early this morning. She brought intelligence of a dreadful disaster. It appears that the steamer Ville de Havre, which left ,New York on the loth November for Havre, under command of Captain Surmount, came into collision at two o'clock on the morning of the 23d of November with the British ship Loch erne from London, bound to New York and sank her. Two hundred and sev enty-six passengers of the Ville de Havre were lost. The Trimountain saved eight and brought them to Car diff. Among tho passengers of the Villo de Havre were Andrew Mc- Creery, also several members of the evangelical alliance returning from New York. MoCreery was saved and with him the son of Mr. Waite of the Brevoort House, New York. The sis ter of Mr. Waite was lost. Paris, Nov. 30. It is reported that the post of Minis ter at Washington, has been tendered to M. Fournier.

General Mantueffel and Count Goe ber fought a duel yesterday. The lat ter was shot in the stomach, and seri ously wounded. Havana, Nov. 30. News of the settlement of the Vir ginius question between Spain and the United States, and the terms on which it is based, were received here with much excitement. Perfect orderpre vails among nil. The chief authorities of the Island assembled in conference and sent a manifesto to the Spanish Government, asking it to wait till it had received a statement about the Virginius case, which shows the right of capture and the justice of the sub sequent proceedings. The mass of the people oppose the surrender of the Vir ginius or yielding to pretensions which may dishonor the Spanish flag. Tho tone of the press accords with the pop ular feeling. Extraordinary means and resources are being created to re sist any aggressive act, although thinking people do not expect any, knowing the prudence of the American Government. Havana, Dec. 1. The Ironclads Mohaplc and Ossipee arrived here on Saturday. Municipal Election. The election for five members of the Common Council, three members of the Board of Education and one As sessor, took place yesterday.

Governor Downey (or United States Senator. Editors Herald:—Casserly has resigned his seat in time for the Leg islature to elect his successor. Surely all Southern California should be unanimous in presenting to the Legis ture a Southern Californian for either the long or the short term, us United States Senator. There is only one fit name which we can offer. It is that of John G. Dow ney. The State at large acknowledges his merit, and his past services as Governor of the State in a great crisis. This is a commendation which the people of California cannot overlook. His name belongs to the State. There is an exigency beyond the moment, which we cannot quite reach by perti nent argument just now, which ought to prompt every Californian to send John G. Downey to the Senate. In due time. Governor Downey, as Uni ted States Senator, can and will set forth his reasons. The fitness of the times requires it and if he will consent to allow his friends to present his name to the Legislature now in session, we feel assured that this body cannot ignore his olaims.

To-morrow's Union will contain the following from Tucson, Arizona, dated 25th November: Additional particulars of Arizona Apaches from the Cachise reservation raiding into Sonora for plunder and Indiscriminate murder, are almost daily coming to hand. In the inter ests of suffering humanity the Govern ment of the United States should use its power to stop the slaughter of our peaceful neighbors. It is believed.that Gen. Vandever, the LTnited States In dian Inspector who recently made an official visit to Cachise's reservation, will make a report that will show how the local agent blinds the public by false reports and avoids thorough dis cipline or fair investigation of the conduct of the Apaches in his charge. Santiago Redondo arrived from Al tar, Sonora, yesterday, In pursuit of thirteen horses stolen from him, which were traced in the direction of the Ca chise reserve. He brought a letter from the Prefect of Altar, directed to the commanding officer at Camp Grant asking assistance in getting his stock from that reserve. The Apaches re cently stole 16 horses, which were traced to the Cachise reservation. The interested agent and others uphold the Indians. An honest search proves that the people of Sonora have suffered by Cachise's Indians intensely more than ever has been represented.* NEVADA. Fatal Mi out lug Affray. Elko, Nov. 30. 8. S.

Davis had a double-barrelled shotgun In readiness, and in an instant fired, but missed. Hedge now took shelter behind a wagon, but Davis let go a second load of buckshoLwhich tore away the ab domen of Hedge, producing instant death. Hedge had hardly reached the ground when young Brown pulled his revolver and sent a ball through his brother-in-law's brain, the ball enter ing above the left eye and passing en tirely through his head. Brown then mounted his horse and escaped. SALT LAKE. Fire—Bodies Burned -.Supposed Incen diarism Parade of Troops. Salt Lake, Dec. 1. At Alta City last night, the house of Madame E.
