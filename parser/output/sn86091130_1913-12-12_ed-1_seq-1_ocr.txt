If the people generally may well have the responsibility ofelecting their President, why not assume the responsibility of nominating him.

Wilson Should [Throw these Crim-j inalsinto Jail at once The innate cussedness and per verse wickedness of human nature is again revealed in the following dispatch of the Asso ciated Press: Chicago, Nov. 17—The an nual meeting of beet sugar manufacturers was held here to day and new officers elected for 1914. will be the last to be marketed, it was said, as beet sugar will be unablp to compete wirh free cane sugar after 1916. One hundred million dollars in vested in beet sugar factories, according to one delegate, will be forced to find new employ ment within a year. President Wilson, Secretary Bryan, and the balance of them should lose no time in bringing these beet sugar criminals to jus tice. Early in the present game it was announced that any man ufacturer who went out of bus iness or cut wages and pretend ed that it was on account of the Tariff legislation might expect tobe landed in jail. What bus iness had any owner of an in Next year's crop dustry to pretend that he knew more about the effects of the Tariff on that industry than Prof. Wilson? Clearly none at all. And if any such undertook to pretend that they did—why, they could see how they liked ly ing in jail, that's all. The case of the beet sugar people is a good one ol which to make an example. They have something like a hundred million dollars invested m the factories, practically all of it in machinery which is good for no other pur pose. They say they will find it impossible after the next crop to compete with the cane sugar imported by the Sugar Trust, so they will have to scrap their hundred millions worth of mach inery and go into some other line of industry. The 40,000 farmers who have been growing sugar beets at a fair profit will also go to doing something else. Perhaps a few weeks in jail wouldn't hurt them either. We certainly trust Prof. Wilson will lose no time in going after these malefactors and putting them all where they belong, Go to it Woodrow.
