1 VOL. 12. it'hrcliitfi Register. Gold alosed 'n New Terk Saturday at mi- , , , From our reports this morning the probabilitiaa are that tba weather te-day will be partly cloudy, with variably winds, and nodecided change of temperature. Thk reports from Mississippi this nu.rning show trouble there. It sounds strangely at tirst, that, after quiet elections, difficulties should so auddonlv break out, but the problem is easily solved as the dispatches are read to their dose. ' Evidence has just be received that Governor Amks and his Attorney General, Georoh E. Harris, incited and advised the invasion of the city ,Vicksburg) to-day" Yesterday, the day of these troubles, t'oiJgresss assembled. Amks is Bltlkb's *>n-in-law, and Butler has been recent ;v defeated. Comment is unnecessary. We are glad that steps have been taken arrest the ringleaders in these riots. | ' mm i iu; riimuEirrti nLss.tut:. We present this morning u full report j of the President's message to our readers, j His Eieolh jjey evidently thinks the ^naneial question as t/ie one of greatest importance, lie has, therefore, given it the preference at the beginning of his me?age. His idea is, that specie payments alone, otier any blame to the suffering which are claimed to be part and j parcel of the present time. Ho says that j the country is in a prostrate condition; i hut -he has, within herself, the three j elements of prosperity?an abundance of capital, a plenitude of labor, ai.J a line soil upon which -ic can rely for substantial benefit. Trusting alone to these to work out h-T ultimate salvation, he recommends as -p lv a return as possible to specie pa} iio'iit.-, and suggests, as the nearest wiiv to this, a repeal of the legal tender n. t. Fr< e-hanking, he thinks, will naturally follow. In thoso sections where mom-} is wanted, banks will be estubii-heil to -upply it, and if the volume of currency is superabundant, the banks w:;i coiuwi im*?r m uiuni iuiu j they ileav readily redeem it. This repeal, 1. uvwr, is nut to apply to contracts n beore the date set for the law to take effect, and, in the meantime, in " rd-r tliut there may be a supply of Lard currency in the treasury to meet tin- demands of the country, ho advises m il a system of custom s duties and general taxation, that the expenditures f the government may not equal the receipt*. With great satisfaction, he announces p-no- with ail foreign powers. He dethe great difficulty which exists | b-tween (.*hinu and Japan; but declares i- intention of the (Government to re' t i Ural should any serious trouble .r betw eeii those nations. Ho says that, though he had recommended the . iin.tv due the United States from '.span, t" he remitted, still, as Congress ad taken no action in the matter, the I iiit?*d States Minister in that country I L.rl collected the amount, and it was sug- j Rested that the funu be applied to the education of Americans in J the Japanese language, so that I th.-v might act as interpreters, or that Japai.c..* students should he instructed : in - jr vernacular an<l customs. Ho re- ! , gards a knowledge of the languages of I ' if two nations as very necessary toMrd# producing intimate friendly rela- i The government of Venezuela, too, "na? r.et yet paid the awards due to American citizens; but it is thought, ' if the Republic can be freed from ! J 'rial >lissen?sions, she will bo ready to ? s.iowledge her just indebtetiness, and i '" et her obli gations. The ciaiins agr.inst Spain arc easily ! ''.t'.-d. They grew out of the Yirginius j *"Ts,r. and the President suggests that, ! 1 * the Cuban insurrection has, by j exceeded all expectations and ^pain ha< manifested no ability to manage the trouble, it may become neces- i "i:v for ail civilized powers to unite in ' ppressing the war. He alludes, <juite forcibly, to the sub. vt of Chinese immigration, and regards t:,? -ystem as now practiced as mere 14v?'ry in general, while in certain cases ' ' even worse. To this, the special at t.on of Congress is invited. H.'thru touches briefly upon the niat' r of the boundary line between tbe ' ted States and the British p<?ssessions; 4 '-des also to the maraudings carried on :.v Mexican outlaws on the United | sUt? frontiers, and recommends that | '- ngress take such action in conjunc. ( n w.th the Mexican authorities, as tuay be necessary to suppress them. He ! nude* too, t<> the rights guaranteed all ! f Persons d.-siring to become naturalized t tirensoftbe United States, but con-j mn? -trongly the action of many who j "*T" taken advantage of securing citi-: l, n?hip here and then, without intend. ,r e to be American citizens, have made j of their privileges to return to their -atiwe lands, and under the pretext of avintj been naturalized here, claim rcJ' "ration from the duties demanded of there. He advises Congress to "" k carefully into this, and rectify the nil. H-ganling tbe tariff, he suggests such H ^vision, that all articles manufactured ^ I In the United States, or those J **uch are used in connection with our i i manufactories, not produced here, n ba declared duty free, but be recommei a system of taxation, so that tbe raven ball be increased, while tbe expenditu of the government shall be diminish He, in allusion to Southern affairs, s that he honestly believes the X ; Loou government in Louisiana have been legally chosen, and as he 1 recognised it once, he would continue do so, unless stopped by Congressio action. Still, he sympathizes with Southern citizens, and acknowledj that they have been great sufferers i the evil governments to which they h? been subjected. He evidently hopes tl Congress will relieve him from t | scrape. His excellency is ouite sensit regarding tho administration ot aflu in the District of Columbia, and dw< considerably upon them. He claims tl many unjust charges have been brouj I against the rulers there, and that the ! debtedness entailed upon the citizens by no means, as great as represent He desires to see the capital of t cauntry a magnificent city. These are about tha pridcipal poii made. Regarding tho vital questio at issue in this country, t President is direct and positive bis sentiments. But he manife most decidedly, the partisan in all 1 comments, and his remarks, particular on the South, read like a leader frt some administration journal. Touching thus briefly and hurriedly u on his message, we submit it to our rea ers to pass their own comments. Trouble iu Sew Orlennw. New Orleans, December 7.?Ci Attorney Lacy resigned a few days aj. and suggested the necessity of at on filling the vacancy, the City Council si cordingly elected B. F. Jonas, City A torney.

HBER 8, 1874. jTHE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A Bird's Eye View of Matters in General. The Financial Problem Dis cussed. Specie Payments?The Panacea. Foreign and Domestic Affairs j 7b the Senate and Howie of Reprceeutai tives : Since the convening of Congress one | year ago, the nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries | such as has not been witnessed with us for many years. Speculation as to the causes for this j prostration might be indulged in without protit. because, as many ttieories | would be advanced as there would be in; dependent writers?those who expressed I their own views. Without borrowihg I upon the subject, without indulging in ! tneories as to the cause of this prostra| tion, therefore, I will call your attention I only to the lact, and to some plain qucsI tions, as to which it would seem there J should be no disagreement, j During this prostration two essential I elements of prosperity have been most j abundant: labor and capital. Both have be?*n largely employed, and where sei curity has been undoubted,capital has been ; attainable at very moderate rates, and ; where labor has been wanted it has been found in abundance, at cheap rates, coinJ pared with what of the necessaries and I'comforts of life could bo purchased with the wages demanded. Two great elei ments of prosperity, therefore, have not been denied us. A third might be added. | Our soil is unequalled within the limits j of any contiguous territory under one | nation, for its rarity of produce, to feed ' and clothe a people, aigLon the amount I of surplus to spare t<^Pfed less favored ; pOOp.CS. 1 Iirreiore Willi incur invia in j view it seems that wise statesmanship at < this session of Congress, would dictate ' legislation ignoring the past, and deeidj ing in the proper channels these great elements of prosperity. To any people debt and credit are the only elements that can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any j continued depression in the industries and prosperity of our people. The Currency <t>icsllon. A great conflict for the national existence made necessary for temporary | purposes, raising of large sums of money I irom whatever source attainable, | in the wisdom of Congre s, and | I do not doubt their wisdom in the I premise? regarding the necessity of the j times to device a system of National currency, which, has proved to lie impossible, ; to keep on a par with the recognized I currency of the civilized world. This fagot a spirit of speculation and extravagance and luxury, riot required tor the happiness or prosperity of ? peoI pie, and involving both directly and inj directly foreign indebtedness. The currency, Ire ing of a fluctuating value, and j therefore unsafe to hold for legitimate i transactions requiring money, became a | subject of speculation in itself. These two causes, however, have inI volved ns in a foreign indebtedness coni traded in good faith by borrower and | lender, which should he paid in certain I and according to the bond agreed upon , when the debt xvas contracted?gold or j its equivalent. The good faith of the government can I riot be in violated towards creditors with I out national disgrace; but our Coinmrrrc hlimilit l?c riirinirnniil. American ship building ami carrying capacity increased in foreign markets sought fur product* id* the toil and manufactures, to the end that we may he able to pay these debts. Where a new ; market can be created fur tie- -ale of our | products, either of the foil, the mine <?r I the manufactory, a new means is dUcov| ered of utilizing our idle rapititl and j labor, to the advantage of the whole peo: pie. But, in my judgment, the first step towards accomplishing this object is t<> - cure a currency good wherever riviliza| tii'ii reign-; one which, when it becomes i superabundant with one people will j tirid a market with some other; a currency which ha- a- it* basis the labor necessary to produce it. which will give I to it its value, (iold and silver, are now the recognized mediums of exchange, the civilized world over, arid tothi- we should return with the least practicable delay, in i view of the pledges of the American Congress, when our prev.-nt legal tender sys' tern was adopted. There should be no . delay, certainly no unnecessary delay in { fixing, bv legislation, a method by which , we f hull return to specie, and to the ac; cotnpli-lirnent of thi* end I invite ronr -pecial attention. I believe, firmly, there | can be no prosperous arid permanent revival of the bu?ines? and industries until ; a policy is adopted, with legislation to i carry it out. looking to a return to a specie I ba*is. It is easy to conceive that the spectila; tive classes may think it of value to them l to make so called money abundant until | they ran throw a portion of their business on others, but even these, I believe, would be disappointed in the result if a course should be pursued which will j keep in doubt the value of the legal tender medium of exchange. A Revival of Productive Industry ! Seeded by all classes. and by none more than holder* of property of whatever tort, with debts to liquidate for the realization j upon it* tale, but admitting that the*e two cla?*e? of cit:x-n* are to be benefitted by expansion, would not the general Iom be too?reat to justify ?uob relief? Would it nut be just a* honest and i prudent to authorize each debtor to ivue hi* own legal tender* to the extent of hi* | liabilities than to do tbi*, would it not be i safer fir fear of over issue* by unscrupulous creditor* to say that ail debts and ^obligations are obliterated in the I'nited .Stater, and now are we to commence . anew, each po**e??ing all h<* has at the time free from incumbers nee? Tb<-e f position* are too absurb to be entertained i for a moment by thinking or honest peoi pie. Yet every delay in the preparation i for a final resumption partakes of this dishonesty and is only lea* in the hope that a convenient day will at lead amve for the gaud work of redeeming - our pledges to commence. It will never come, in my opinion, except by poaitivi ' i action by Congress. or by national dttasi ten which will destroy, for a time al I least, the credit of individuals and tlx state at large. A sound currency mighl be reached by total bankruptcy and dis- v, credit of the integrity of the nation and w of individuals. w I believe it is the duty of Congress at this session to devise such legislation as b will renew confidence, revive industries, si start us on a career of prosperity to last ' a | for many years, and to save the credit of d< this nation and of this people. Stops to k ward the return to a specie basis are the ' k great requisites to be devotedly sought a | for. and there are others which I may > ti touch upon henceforth. A nation dealing in a currency below I hat of specie in value labors under two j great disadvantages. First, having no I ^ use for the world's acknowledged me- i dium of exchange, gold and silver; these J J j are driven out of the country because ! there is no demand for their use. Second, j (j( the medium of exchange in u*e being of j ^ a fluctuating value, lor, after all, it is , i only worth just what it will purchase ^ of gold and silver metals, having an in- I trinsic value ju>t in proportion to the jj honest labor it takes to produce them?a j ^ larger martrin must Ins allowed for profit i q by the manufacturer and producer. It j ? I is months from the date of production to ^ j the date of realization. Interest must Lj ! be changed, and the risk of fluctuation | J in the value of that which is received in payment, added. Hence high prices ! acting as a protection to the foreign I producer, who receives nothing in ex- t. ' change for the prtnlucU of his skill and j : labor, except a currency good at a staple i j j value, the world over. It seems to me that nothing is clearer i , I than that the greater part of the burdep j I of existing prostration tor the want of a I | sound financial system, falls upon the ^ I working man, who must, after all producethe wealth,and the salaried man who ^ ; superintends and conducts business. The j( j burden falls upon them in two ways, by I the deprivation of employment and the , decreased purchasing power of their sals- ()) ! ries. It is the duty of Congress to I ! devise the method of correcting the evils j which are acknowledged to exist, and not S mine; but I will venture to suggest two or three things which seem to me as | absolutely necessary to a return to specie j c( payment: Two or Three Xw-ssarj Kuxaeatlon*. The first great requisite in n return to j prosperity, the legal tender clause to the .. j law authorizing the issue of currency by . | the National government, should be re- ^ j pealed, to take effect as to all contracts ^ I entered into after a day fixed in the re- ^ pealing act; not to apply, however, to the j, | payment or salaries byjtie government, j, | or for other expenditures now provided i for by law to he paid in currency. In the interval pending between the i repeal and final resumption, provision i should be made by w hich the Secretary j I of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may , become necessary from time to time. | Krorn t lie date w hen specie r. -iiinpliori ^ j commences totbis, there might and should ! ' I b ' added a revenue sufficiently in excess J . of the expenses to insure aii accutnula- j I tion <>f gold in the Treasury to su-tain I , th<" redemption. I commend tlii- subject | to your careful consideration, believing thut n favorable solution is obtainable, , ; and that, if reached by this Congress, L : that the present and future generation* _ will ever gratefully remember it as their j '' deliverance from a thraldom of evil and | disgrace. Free Hanking. w With resumption, free banking may be p? I authorized with safety, giving lull pro- fr ' tection to bill holders, which they have jj, under existing laws. Indeed, I would regard free banking as essential. It ,.< | would give proper elasticity to the our- (lj reney, a- more currency should la- rej <1 nired for th? transaction of legitiI mate business. New banks would |? be started, and in the towns p, , banks would bring up their business, w when It waa found^tnat there was a super- di I abundance of currency. ni The experience and judgment of tin* n j people can liest decide ju?t how niueh currency is required for the transa tion I of the business of the country. It is unI safe to leave the settlement of this ques- *' tion to Congress, the Secretary of the ' Treasury or the Executive. Congress * I should make the regulations und'-r w hich ' hanks may exist, but should rot make !' banking a monopoly by limiting the I amount of redeemable paper currency j 111 j that-h ill lie authorized. Such imporlance do I attach to this subject, and so | w : earnestly do I commend it to your atten- > '' te.ri that I gi% e it prominence by intro- i ^ ducing it at the beginning of the nn-s- I .. sage.

It is hoped that the negotiations beveen the Government of Japan and ie treaty powers, looking to the further pening of the empire and to the rciuovi of the various restrietions upon trade nd travel, may soon produce the results sored, whieh cannot fail to enure to the fneflt of all parties. Having on previous occasions submitd to the eonsideration of Congress the ropriety of the release of the Japanese overnment from further payment of ie indemnity, under the Convention of ctobur 22d, 180-4, and as no action had ;en taken thereon, it became my duty ? regard the objections of the Convenon as in force, and as the other powers iterested had received their projrtion of the indemnitv in full, the linister of the United States I Japan has, in behalf of ns government, received the remainder ' the amount due the United States un?r this convention of Samona>eki. I ibmit the propriety of applying the iti>nie of a part, if not of the whole, of this ind to the education, in the Japanese nguage, of a number of young men to under obligations to serve the governicnt for a specified time, as interpreter* . the legations, and the consulates in span. A limited number of Japanese juths might, at the same time, be eduited in our own vernacular, and mutual neflts would result to l*>tli governents.
