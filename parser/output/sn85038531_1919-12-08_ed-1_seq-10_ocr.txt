House. i, President Wilson's friends have de tected for soma weeks an organized ! effort to discredit him by spreading unfounded rumors ss to his mental condition. These falsa reports have usually been spread . by word of mouth, and have been backed, up by Vague insinuations of republican press agents. ' perhaps the most brazen pert of the well-constructed plsn wss the giving out of Interviews by various republican members of congress after the reading of the president's message to congress. Inti mating that they did not believe the message was formulated or dictated by the president. -The almost identi cal character 'of these Interviews left little doubt that they were inspired by a common purpose. Only An Exouse. Everyone In touch with sffniri at the capltol or in earshot or the re1 publican gossip knows that ths Max. lean situation was only sn excuse to fret .to the president, with the hope that his condition would justify tne raising of the question of his Inabil ity under ths constitution to perform ths duties of the office. Ths purpose wss poorly concealed. Ths hope died bard, but it Is -nevertheless dead. Incidentally, tha interview was punctuated by a dramatic and unex pected Interlude when ths state de partment telephoned to tha presi dent's bedside while the senators were there, that Consular Agent Jenkins had been released at Puebla In re sponse to the American government's demand. What the senatorial critics did not know, as ths result of the conference, and what they learned, was that the president had been kept In touch with the Mexican trouble and was fully In formed of all Its ramifications. The propaganda exaggerating the nature of the president's illness origi nated with the letter of Senator Mo ses, of Now. Hampshire, one of the hltterest partisans on the republican lde. In writing to a constituent, Mo ses expressed th opinion that "the president will never Again be a ma te.lul force or factor in anything." President Wilson could not resist his little Joke at "Doctor" Moses' expense. Tha latter received a personal mes sage from the sick man. It was de livered bv Senator Fall, '"To whom It was entrusted by the president dur Ing the conference. When the presi dent asked Senator Fall if he would convey a message f the self-appointed diagnostician, the senator readily ngreed. "It will tend to reassure, but prob ably disappoint him," the president said. "Please tell "Doctor" Moaes, if IVAnnunzIo was credited in Lon don . dispatches from - Dalmatian sources on Ssturday with having ar ranged an ambitious schema for the advancement of his cause revolving about an attack on Spalato. It was also declared efforts were being mode to instigate uprisings in Montenegro snd Albania as a part of the Spalato undertaking and that tha Bulgarians were being urged to attack the Jugo slavs. It -was suggested the project as reported was "not entirely .

Dec. S. (A. P.)-4 Slater Hansen, who furnished the ball upon which W. O. Jenkins, the American consular agent at Puebla, was released, declared last night he had acted on his own .initiative. He issued this statement: "I wish to say the following; On Tuesday morning last, on icpount of certain facts that came, to my atten tion which I am in no position to disclose, I suddenly realised Mfat wur between the United States and Mex ico was inevitable unless one of the two governments was ready to sacri fice Its honor, prestige and dignity by receding froi.. the dangerous po sltion Into wnlcn it was forced. ' "I therefore took all. the steps necessary to effect the Immediate re lease on ball, of W, O. Jenkins and relieve the tension. I did so spon taneously ana of my own Initiative, and I am ready and "willing to take lipon myself the full responsibility or credit, according to the point of view. "It was a source of infinite pleas ure to me to hear that the news of the release of Jenkins cheered our president, and I ardently hope' that his complete recovery is near.
