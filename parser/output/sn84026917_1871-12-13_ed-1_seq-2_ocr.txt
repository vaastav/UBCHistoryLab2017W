OUR WASHINGTON UTTER. WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec 9th, 1871. After si* months of lethargy tad stupid dolines?, this city has again as? sumed its winter or Congress look of liveliuess. Our sol?os met in coaocii yesterday and after the usual prayers io both Houses, proceeded to business. In the .Senate the stump speaking chap? lain, Dr. Newman, made a prayer io which he alluded to justice overtaking the Tammany ring, but forgot to state whether justice was ou the track of some of the rings of the administration, which are equally as bad, if not worse than the ring in New York, which was crushed by the assis fan ce of Democratic Totes. Senator Sumner's first words were oo his old hobby, tbe negro, and after re? lieving himself of nix months of silence cn the subject of negro equality, he felt better and subsided. Senator Blair be? gan the war on General Grant by an inquiry, as to recent suspension of the habeas corpus in South Carolina. Mr. Beck did the same in the House. The appoictmeut of the committees io tbe House was a mat. er of considerable interest. The composition of the Ways aud Means committee seems favorable to a reform io the tariff. Dawes, chairman, is claimed by the high tariff men. while Kelley, Maynard and Roberts tre koowo to be in favor of a high tariff. The free trade men, are Brooks, Beck, Keer and Fiokleuburg Burchard is looked upon a* a moderate high tariffite, and bolds the balance of power. As the adminis? tration and the Radical party, as au organization, are entirely in the interest of the protectionists aud monopolists, I cannot for ao instant believe that they have in the most remote degree endan? gered 'be interests of their friends. You csa depend tfoa it, the aypareat fairness of tbe selection of tbe committee of Ways and Meaos is ooly a blind for election purposes, ae>d not a desire to reduce the profits of radical monopolists a peony. The committee is "dead to rights," as the detectives say when they have a thing sure. So fur as a reform in the revenue is concerued there is a de? cided majority of this committee io ito favor, and Heaven knows there is ?dire necessity for it. Coosiderable curiosity was manifested as to what disposition speaker Blaine would make of his antag? onist of last session, the Hon. Benjamin Butler Blaine has dropped the afore? said Benjamin from the Ways and Means committee, and from the chairmanship of the Reconstruction committee," and placed him at the head of the unim? portant committee, on the revision of the Laws. This announcement caused considerable merriment. Judge Poland, who held this position last session, went over to the somewhat surpri*ed and much chagrined Butler, and congratu? lated him on his recognition by the speaker. When Butler retired to the cloak room be said in a jocose way, *'the bead of the table alter all is where the Mc Nab sits, and it may be that this rouud about way of snubbing one's ene* mies is not so masterly as it appears to be." Benjamin probably sees some way of returning Mr. Blaine's compliment, and is not disposed of so completely as is thought. The President's message ou some questions is shilly-shally, on others very decided. The abuse of Catacazy, the Russian Minister, re? markably so. Grant always sticks to his frieuds and relations. That is his best hold. His brother-in-law is one of the counsel for the Peikens claim, which is against the Russian Government, and which Catacazy has opposed. This claim is considered a fraud by Catacazy lt appear? that thc President, by letter, a* a personal favor to himself, asked the Czar to favorably consider this claim. Doe? not the President back his friends ? ."ocia! difficulties have aggravated the former difficulty, and the result is, the Minister has been recalled tod a part of , Grant's annual message ts devoted to a ? overing up of his friendly designe in I his brother io law's behalf, as well as the entailing of Madame Catacazy by : Madame Grant, Fish and others, who j determined til at thia beautiful lady < should nu longer reign in tho capital, aa . une of Mir queens of beauty, aud leader? ' of the fa>hion. The Chronicle of thia , city, edited by the notorious ex-Gov. i Holdeo, cfN C' wys: "The President i gives s very hard rap on the knuckles ' of those publie meo who reooiutuend j any body to office, who keep them, ( whether flt or unfit, hon ea i or dishonest \ Will these gentlemen really feel it, and I heed it?"
