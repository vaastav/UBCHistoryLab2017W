MONDAY. DECEMBER IS, 1920. WEBSTER CITY FREEMAN Issued eyerj Monday by the Free. nan-Journal Publishing Company Webster City, Iowa. Fo reign-Advertising Representative I "AMERICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION THE Entered at the Webster City officc as Second Class Matter. Post- The Freeman and Journal, both papers, per year $2.50 The Daily Freeman-Journal, by mail, per year $5.00 Delivered, in city per year— Tlie yell of I lit' exposed profiteer is sweet music to the ears of the average consumer. Attorney General l'alnier brought down the price of coal just like Presi dent Wilson kept lis out of war. Restoration of a protective tariff will not cure all our ills, but it will cure, some of tliein. Wait and see. The people of North Dakota are find ing that the Townley brand of hot air is no better than the numerous other brands that have been used for years. Mr. Bryan resigned when Mr. Wilson wanted him to, but Mr. Wilson doesn't seem in any hurry lo respond to the re quest of Mr. Bryan that he resign. It might be well for William Jennings Bryan to call the attention of Presi dent Wilson to that little matter of resigning, The president seems to have forgotten all about it. Corn is worth about ten cents a bushel more than it was a short time .tgo. Every little helps. If it would get up to 75 cents on local markets a lot of it would be sold, we believe. If you want to help in the batik1 against tuberculosis, which claims l.'O.OOO victims every years in the I'll it ed States, buy and use Christmas seals. Every penny added to the value of a bushel of corn means at least $4,000,000 to Iowa and every cent taken from the value of a bushel of corn means a loss to this slate of the same amount. Yes, we nil wanted prices to come down, but we wanted them to take the elevator instead of plunging headlong from the fifth story window, as prices of farm products did. Tlie United States ought lo produce everything compatible with its climate, soil, and resources, including all prod ucts of the farm and factory, mine and Held. To make this possible a pro tective tariff must be maintained.. When they were making money fast a lot of jieople acted as though they thought the wave of prosperity would never recede or break upon the shore. Now they see their mistake. President Wilson's late massage to congress emphasizes the need of econ omy in governmental affairs. It took Mr. Wilson a long time to come, to a realization of the fact that too much ex travagance is being practised. The league should not regard itself as deserted by Mr. Wilson because lie failed to mention it in his message to congress.—Pes Moines Register. No, Mr. Wilson hasn't deserted the league, but the league appears to have deserted Mr. Wilson. President-elect Harding stated a few days ago that, no offers of cabinet posi tions bad yet been made. This ought' to put a quietus to the reports that cer tain men bad been approached by Mr. Iistrding asking if they would accept certain positions in the cabinet. "Merry Christmas" is going t$ have a hollow sound for the man who has been laid off indefinitely by his em ployer.—Des Moines Register. And tlie employer who has to lay off his employes on account of restricted business is also going to have his share of annoying thoughts on Christmas. President Wilson seems to think that they .should have genuine democracy every place in the world except in some sections of the United States. He knows if democracy were a living fact in such states as Mississippi and Alabama he would not have been chosen presi dent in 1010. President. Wjlson's last message, to congress recommends the adoption of the budget plan. Well, congress pass ed a bill at its previous session provid ing for tin budget system and Wilson promptly vetoed if. As a preacher who doesn't practice what ho preaches Wood row has no peer. And now il is reported that l.l.OOO. 000 Europeans will come to this coun try during the next few years unless congress prevents. Immigration is now very large. But we rememlier that the brewers and distillers declared before prohibition was adopt ed that it would stop immigration. Seems they were mistaken. ltoosovelt was awarded the Nobel peace prize and it is to go to Wilson this year. It was giveji to Roosevelt because of his successful efforts in bringing about peace between Russia and Japan. Just why it. is awarded to Wilson (lie Freeman-Journal cannot say. Probably because he kept us out of war. The demand for building materia! in 102^ is going to be good if prices are reasonable. Those who have the power of price making have the prob lem in tlieir own hands. Nobody is expecting pre-war prices, but every body has the right to expect reductions below the 1010 and 1020 figures, and reductions of fair dimensions. Loaning money to farmers may tide them over, but unless the value of crops increase, and we all hope they will, it will be. hard to meet pay day. If an outlet for the surplus at fail prices could be obtained it would be much better for the fanner and for all business than extending credits would be. Every man seems to think that the other fellow is getting the best of the deal during the present readjustment. —Algona Republican. Wo dissent. Nobody is thinking just now that, the farmer is getting the. best of it. nor is he banker's path full of roses. But everybody has his own troubles. In 1012 the Democrats proposed lo reduce the price of print paper by cut ting the tariff. Well, they cut. it. all rij'.bt. At that time print paper was worth from .$-10 to $."0 per ton. Now it is selling at from $200 to per ton. But the present outlook is that, the peak has been reached, and we an thankful for that. Senator Kenyon declared some timi ago that Iowa had invested perhaps $.*00,000,000 in wildcat jind near wild cat stocks, which investments wen not worth two cenls on the dollar. Others who have kept tab on this class of "in vestments"' agree that the senator's estimates were none too high. That is one of the things that ails Iowa right now. Secretary Tumidly says (lie public generally has not recognized the hu man qualities of. President Wilson. Tlie secretary is mistaken. The public has recognized if, but Tumulty appar ently has not. The public knows thai "to err is human," and hence the pub lic long ago realized that Wood row Wilson was the most human of any prominent man in tlie country. A dispatch from Fort: AA'illiam, On tario, Canada, of recent date serves to remind farmers that an impost duty on wheat would be a pretty good thing for them just now. The dispatch says that "shipments of Canadian wheat from here to United Slates ports, which have been exceptionally heavy daring the last few days, continued today when six more shfps, carrying 00. 000 bushels, left for Buffalo." The Chicago Tribune, which owns a paper mill of its own, is not being hit as hard as other newspapers by the print paper trust, hence it. can an nounce a reduction in the price of its Sunday edition. However, tlie Tribune must have to pay I he same increase in other material and for help that other newspapers pay. These are at least double of pre-war prices anil there is no indications that I hey will soon be reduced. Master Builders of Rochester, Minn., have announced a reduction in the building wage scale, according to dis patches sent out from that city. Brick layers are reduced from $1.12'/j to .$1 an hour, and plasterers, electricians, plumbers and la theirs from ifl.121/.. to 00 (rents an hour. Twelve hundred men are affected. The builders declared costs of building materials are going down and "workmeji must bear their share in reducing building costs." Nate Kendall has the ambition lo be cue of the best governors Iowa ever bad. It. is a laudable ambition and everybody interested in the welfare of the stale will hope that be may win. But he sets the mark high. If bis ad ministration eoui|iares favorably with the administrations of Samuel J. Kirk wood. William Larrabec and Albert I!. Cummins lie will have every reason to feel proud and the people will have every reason lo f-el gratified. Mr. Kendall has a great opportunity and the Freeman-Journal believes he will make the most of it. business tliey may take, on such char acters as Collins. But being managed by long-headed business men it is not likely that they would try to capitalize the phiz of Collins or any other bandit. Many might turn out to se.e Collins lie cause of maudlin curiosity, but the sub stantial element of society would be disgusted with such an exhibition. Cow Cov has sent word to Presi dent-elect Harding that if the next .resident: wishes to resign from the. .senate at this time and is deterred be cause fearing the appointment of a Democratic successor, that lie (Cox) will appoint Senalor-elcct Willis im mediately upon the resignation of Sen ator Harding. This is a commendable thing for Cov. Cox to do and whether or not Senator Harding will resign sooner than he intended, having set the date as of Jan. 10 or 11, lie must appreciate the. considerate offer ol Gov. Cox, who has power to appoint a senator to fill a vacancy that, occurs icfore the expiration of his term as governor. AVilliam Jennings Bryan is. indeed, the great: commoner and also an ex perienced politician, but. lie shoots wide the mark when blaming the demo ratic defeat on a "wet candidate and an evasive platform."—Washington, Iowa, Democrat. Ouite right. The platform and can didate of the Democratic party had very little to do with the result. Any platform and any candidate would hiive met the same fate. The people are tired of Wilsonism and disgusted with tlie Democratic party. They wanted a change and knew jUst how to get it. The average voter hoped for bet ter conditions with another parly at the helm. He figured that they could be no worse. Taxation—state, county and town,-— cannot be materially reduced until cost of service of various kinds is re duced, except in instances where ex travagance has been practiced. The biggest expense to the taxpayer is the schools and this cannot be reduced un til tlie pay of teachers is cut, the price oL' fuel cheapened and the rate of inter est lessened. It is going to be some problem to get back to normal in the matter of taxation and probably nor malcy will never be realized. If not. tlie price of farm products must be in creased or (here will be a decreased production. Farmers cannot pay high rates of interest, high taxes and high costs of other things unless the value ol what they produce is sufficient to yield a fair profit. v- If hold-ups continue to increase in numbers in Pes Moines and other cities it will not be long until every man who is out after dark will leavi all bis small change at. home and carry a loaded revolver in his hand, perhaps one in each hand. If a few highway*men were shot while in the act it would be rather discouraging to others. The robberies being committed in tiie larger cities are astounding the country. We seeui to be passing through an era of outlawry never known before, but the biggest thieves are the ones who are robbing the people right and left on such necessary commodities as coal, and for itself the Freeman-Journal can say it has more respect for the bank robber or for the hold-up man than it has for these big ger rascals. The board of supervisors of Hardin county has just sold $!C,000 worth of county bonds. The bonds bear six per cent interest and were discounted $2.":!. According to the Eldora Ledger Hardin county now has outstanding bonds ag gregating $.'!2o.0(0. which means that Hie county has expended that much more than the county treasurer has received. Boards of supervisors now have authority to issue county bonds without a vote of the people. A power that should never have been granted lid which should lie taken away from them as soon as the legislature can en act. the necessary measures. No board or council or any other body should have power to bond the projKTly of the people without a vote of the people. Keith Collins, said lo be "the master mind" of the Council Bluffs train rob bery, has it in his noodle that he will be. in great demand by the movies as.efficiency, soon as he gets out of jail. He thinks'lie was sure that Lieutenant Grams the movies can afford to pay him at^orff was dead and informed that gen least $100,000 a year. If the movies'fleinan that his body would soon ar-|is a millionaire himself. Probably lie want to seriously cripple their own rive from France lo be buried by the likes to splurge and show off, But Calvin government. So the lieutenaut is daily watching for the-arrival of his own body and will have the satisfaction of attending his own funeral, a thing that most of us will be denied the pleasure of. Nobody can yet tell what kind 6f a president AVarren G. Harding will make. lie talks well, being very carc ful about making foolish promises and extravagant statements. He appears Ic la* a very level headed man with great, good sense and may prove to be one of the strongest executives the country ever had. All will admit that he has big tasks before him, some of the gravest that ever confronted a piesident of the United States. AVe are all hoping that he will prove the right man in the right place and demon strate that the people made no mis take in electing him by the largest majority on record. Tlie country ought to get behind liiin and give him all proper encouragement and assistance. Senator Harding, we believe, is going lo make a president such as Benjamin Harrison and AVilliam McKinley. He appears well balanced, safe and sound— nothing of bombast about him. He is not. taken off his feet by excitement of the moment nor disturbed by the im mensity of tasks before liim. lie pro poses to cooperute with congress and will seek advice and information from reliable sources wherever they may be found. The country has been favorably impressed by the manner of Mr. Harding and has confidence in his abil ity and great good sense. He is going to have the cooperation of tlie people and everybody is hoping that his ad ministration will be a success from every standpoint of right and justice. Secretary Houston seems to "have it: in" for the automobile industry. If his recommendations to congress to make big increases in the tax on auto mobiles and their assessories should be adopted it will be a great burden to the automobile business, as well as to all users of motor propelled vehicles. Of course the government must devise means fo wise enormous sums of money, but caro must be. taken not to destroy legitimate business enter prises. Tf the tax is so high on any article that it materially reUuce.s pro duction of that article the purpose of the lax will be defeated, as no taxes •ran be collected upon a thing that is not produced. Besides it will reduce IJie number of jobs for workmen. The Associated Press Bulletin says that it recently came to the attention of a small country publisher that a certain concern, in order to stimulate sales of its products, promised dealers who bought its goods to inaugurate a newspaper advertising campaign. De liveries'were promptly made and later an announcement was made that on account of business conditions it was not deemed advisable to follow the ad vertising programme as originally in tended. The publisher's advice to the dealers who were thus taken in, was to ship the merchandise back to the manufacturer. AVhen goods are sold to dealers with tlie promise of adver tising, the campaign is really a part of the merchandise, and if not delivered the dealers are fully justified in re turning the goods. Less than 4,000 people in this coun try are killed every year in auto mobile accidents. That Is a terrible loll to pay for carelessness and reck lessness and indifference and no won der the public is exercised over, these sacrifices and is seeking means to re duce the number. But deaths through auto accidents are insignificant com pared to deaths resulting from tubercu losis, 150.000 (lying annually from this disease in the United States alone. These l!i0,000 deaths are regretted, of course, and the friends of the victims are saddened, but there is much less consideration given to ways and means to stop this awful sacrifice than there is lo stop auto accidents. Just think of it, tuberculosis claims a victim every three minutes, ten per cent of all deaths resulting from that malady. Senator Elkins of West Virginia has introduced a bill in the senate provid ing for the construction of a home and office building for the vice president of the United States costing not to Lieutenant Gramslorff of Everett, Mass, is one of the most stubborn in dividuals that, was ever in the army. He served in France very creditably and came home with his associates.lexcml &I50.000, and here we have been No long ago lie received information .talking about economy, from the war department that he was dead! This was rather startling to him, as it was the first intimation lie had received of that eventful fact. However, he was reluctant In believe it and concluded then' must be some mistake. So he wrote Secretary Baker about it, but the eminent secretary was obdurate ami his department wrote again to the lieutenant declaring that lie was dead and telling him just where he had been killed. Slill the cx-soldier was not comineed and again wrote the department. However. Sec retary Baker, who lias "a passion for was noi to be convinced. It may be there is need of sttcli a building, but it is doubtful. However, it ought to wait until sound business conditions are. restored and until the burden of taxation is somewhat removed. True, $.•{.-.0,000 is only a drop in the bucket, but there have been so many of this kind of drops that the old bucket was full long ago and has been running over some time. Better wait until after the expiration of Vice President Coolidgc's term. He is not in the habit of living in such costly apartments and woulil probably not enjoy it. The Freeman-Journal likes the simplicity and good, common, every day .sense ex hibited by (Sow Coolidge. Senator Elkins is the son of a millionaire and Coolidge is a'very different type of man and likes ordinary living accommoda tions. According to Secretary of the Treas ury Ilouson the prosecution of the, war cost the..United States $24,010,0000,0.00. This represents, according to the sec retary, "adjusted expenditures of the. treasury, excluding all other outlay which had not relation to the actual cost of prosecution of the war during the period from April (!. 3017, to June 30, 1020, which covered the extremes of the government war time fiscal opera tions." Total expenditures of tlie gov ernment during that time, exclusive of those of the post office department, amounted to 8:50,SI2.«)."», Of this sum $li,07S,444,007 was obtained from taxes and revenues from sources other than borrowed money. A reduction of SO,.12:1.000,000 must bo made from these figures on account of that sum having been loaned to our late associ ates in the war. Manufacturers and others who have been operating on fair margins of profit during the past, few years and whose principal expense account, is the wage scale, cannot materially reduce prices unless and until wages are re duced. Of course they can reduce in proportion to the reduction in the cost of material so far as the cost of ma terials enters into cost of operations. But a manufacturer -*vlio pays in wages 75 or 80 per cent of his total cannot make much material reduction in selling prices until the big item of wages is readjusted upon a lower basis. He must either hold prices up or shut down. Newspapers generally come within this class, as by far the greatest expense in running tin* aver age newspaper is the pay roll, although the price of print paper has become a very important ilem and tas yet print paper lia,s not. gone down in price. If our senate had adopted tin Treaty of Peace and League of Na tions, we could then grant, credit to starving Europe ami the prices of farm produce would bring twice as good a price as it does today.—New Hampton Tribune. AVonder if that is true? If it is then put down another long mark to thr credit of tlie Democratic party for bringing on present market conditions of farm products. Didn't !!5 of th« 40 Republicans-in the senate vote to join the league and didn't 24 of tlx 47 Democratic senators vote against if? Didn't the Republicans give rati fi.cation more than the necessary two thirds majority on their side of the senate? Then, again, couldn't Presi dent Wilson have secured ratification with reservation by simply saying the word However, the condition of the country is about ^he same as it was at the end of that other Democratic administration in ISOti, hence it is noth ing new. 

DIFFERENT NOW. Is Germany about to revive the "scrap of paper" argument in dealin with the league of nations.—Daven port Time -!. Germany now has a very different government than it had when one of ib.- high officials said "a treaty is only a scrap of paper." It. is only fair to give the new government a chance. Upon the day that congress met to declare war against Germany Presi dent. AVilson said: "AVe have no quarrel with the Ger man people. It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering the war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval." Now the German people have the government. I hey have accepted them selves and the world should give tliein a chance to prove that President AVil son had the right idea in April, 1017. THE 

PROBLEM. At the international live stock asso ciation in Chicago last week there was much discussion of the "farm prob lem," which is a serious problem at this particular time. Gov. Lowden was among the speakers and among other things said: "There is something radically wrong' in any system of production and distribution by which in the prime necessities of life at one time the price is away below the cost of production, and then in a year or two is away above the cost of pro duction. There is not any question but it is very expensive economically to the world. There is not any doubt if we will address ourselves to that question, gathering accurate statistics and by giving publicity to the facts which we all ought to know, that we can work out some method which will keep production in some sort of way Related 1st the needs of the world." Last spring the price of corn ap proached the $2 per .bushel mark on the Chicago market, while now it Is worth jUboiit 7" cents. Taken one year with another through a number of years production and consumption are not far apart. Last spring there was a shortage and so prices soared, sky ward. New there apiiears to lie a surplus i\ud prices are.hitting the bottom. Ifjvantage there could be some method adopted to equalize and stabilize, values of farm products it would go a long way to ward settling the problems that aro annoying and distracting farmers. Mr. Lowden thinks ways will yet be found and it is a hopeful sigh that so many of the best minds of the country are giving serious thought to its solution. A bushel of corn and a pound of beef contain the same food values from year to year and if some plan of marketing and holding could be de vised that would prevent such wide fluctuations it would be better for both consumer and producer. COOPERATIVE MARKETING. It. may not always work to much ad vantage, but some farmers of AVilliam sou county, Texas, found cooperative marketing worked well, according to information sent out by the depart ment of ^agriculture" at Washington, which is as follows: "The AVilliainson County Sheep and Goat Breeders' Association was used as a medium for handling wool. Sealed bids were first received, but, possibly due to opposition to the cooperative movement, no particular advance in price was offered. The farmers' com mittee thanked the bidders and declin ed all offers, and preparations were made for a shipment to Boston. Tha local price immediately went up ccnts, but the growers remained firm and sent the wool away. The Boston price was 25 cents in advance of the original local price. The total gain to the farmers was estimated at ijilH, 020." NOT A CURE, BUT A HELP. The fact is the tariff has about serv ed its purpose, both as a revenue pro ducer and as an encouragc.r of Amer ican production. Our problem is now how to maintain ourselves in the world market, and the tariff does not lend itself to the .solution of that prob lem, except as we, keep it. thoroughly within reason.—Pes Moines Register. The Register seems to have followed Wilson clear into the Democratic party and is now against the fundamental principles of the Republican party. It remains to be seen whether or not "the tariff has about served its purpose," because it is going to be used by the incoming president and congress in the good old way. Free traders have used llie argument for years that a protective tariff does not help us in conquests l'c.r foreign markets,-implying that such a tariff really closed the foreign field. But ex perience* doesn't prove it. Foreigners will buy tlie things of us that they need (if they buy at all) and can buy cheap er here than elsewhere, regardless of tariffs or other considerations. The buyer is going where he can do the best and if lie can do the best in the Amer ican market place that is the market he will patronize. The enactment of a protective tariff is not going to cure all ills from which we aw suffering. But it will help, Only industry, frugality and parserver ance, under fair and reasonable legis lation, can redeem business and eoni m'erce from the results of the last few years of extravagance and plunging. If the people are going to depend upon congress and the administration to bring back the prosperous days of old they will find only disappointment and hardship. 

TARIFF POSSIBILITIES. "Those who are encouraging them selves into (he notion that congress can by putting up tariff duties meet any conisderable part of the public de mands can satisfy themselves with little consideration that the tariff is not going to be nearly so prolific as is promised. Our high water mark in tariff reve nues was in 1010 and then only a little over 000,000 was collected. To talk of trebling that amount now is mere self-deception. It is unlikely that we. can even equal the revenue of the prewar years from duties on imports. —Des Moines Register, Not many people expect that the rev enues of the government fnyu impost duties can be trebbled opjr the revenues from that source duri{iy the pre-iwar period. In 1000 our imports amounted to $l,.riij(!,047,4.'S0 and the Register says we collected in duties $..''..'{,000,000. Well, for the fiscal year of 1010 our im ports amounted in value to $.'{.()!).",870. r82, approximately doubling the im ports of 1010, and during more than four of the months of the fiscal year 1010 the great war was being fought. A statement recently issued by the Na tional City Bank of New York esti mates tl'.e imports the calendar year just closing, based upon importa tions up to the first of November, will reach in value the enormous and un precedented sum of $(5,000,000,000. Now then, if $l..r00.000.000 worth o'f importa tions in 1010 yielded 000,000, $('., 000,000,000 worth of Imports in 1020, if the. sallie rates of duties were paid, would yield the sum of $L:5.'!2,000.000. But, of course, with the increased rate under the tariff In operation in 1010 there would not be as large a volume, of imports, which would lie to the ad of the manufacturers, produc ers and wage earners of this country. But suppose the increased tariff would cut off 40 ier cent of the importations, the importations of 1020 would still pay approximately $800,000,000 into the national treasury. The imparts of more than $8,000,000, 000 .in value of 1910 yielded in custom duties only .$178,01:-!,000 to tlie, national treasury, but under the tariff laws of 1010 they would have yielded, provid ed they had been imported under that law, more than $000,000,000. It is im possible to tell in advance just what the volume of importations would be under a higher protective tariff law, but it is certain that if importations are not large our own manufacturers and wage earners will be benefitted by being vouchsafed reasonable markets her# at home. The $0,000,000,000 worth of goods im ported this year, according to the New York Bank's statement, might have much to do with the present depres sion in business. At ai|y rate, if such vast amounts of goods had not been im ported wo would have the, money here at home which went to pay for them, and a large amount of goods which they displaced Would have beeji pro duced in this country. The question of revenue, therefore, is not the main con sideration that influences national lawmakers in framing a protective tar iff measure. However, if importa tions continue to flow into the United States, thus displacing domestic manu facturers and products, we are partly compensated by having the govern ment's treasury recouped by large sums. 

TEMPORARY RELIEF. Sioux City Journal: So far as may be judged by news reports from AVash ii.'gton the majority of the measures introduced and to be Introduced in congress for the relief of the farmeis are only expedients. They are intend ed to provide temporary relief only and do not reach the seat of the trou ble. They lance the boil, but do nor cure the cause. Of course, temporary relief is essential, because something, must be done at once to save the agri cultural industry from ruin. There fore, congress is wise in bridging the chasm even temporarily. But such re lief must not be allowed to shadow the need for the legislation that will re move the in'use. Creating a condition under whrch the farmers may borrow money to tide them over the period of low prices is all right, provided such tiding over brings them to a market in which tlie farmers may sell their crops at cost of production plus fail profits. But if the market is not pro vided, the evil day is only postponed, for the time of payment will find the farmers facing the same low prices they nivw face, and it is just as well to make the sacrifice now as then. But after they secure a relieve from bankruptcy the cause of their trouble must be located and removed. It is doubtful if any remedial leg islation on the subject would be ap proved by President AVilson. The ad ministration, especially the secretary of the treasury, is hostile to the methods which tb« farmers are urging for tlieir relief. The president has un idea that all the financial difficulties have come upon it because the United States did not enter the league of na tions. But no intelligent, practical in dividual can figure out how member ship in a combination of nations would create a market for wheat and corn and pork and beef, or provide the money in foreign nations to pay for them if bought in this country. Some democratic members of congress, whose constituencies are as seriously affect ed by present conditions as those of re publican members, have announced that they are ready to overcome the presidential hostility by passing relief measures over the ^president's veto. If they stand by their announcement it is possible temporary relief bills, at least, may lie passed early in the pres ent session. If they do not, no relief can be secured until the exlra srssiou which will be called by President Harding shortly after his inauguration. AVliat form either the temporary or the permanent relief measures will tfike cannot be forecast. There are a number of plans, each of which.reaches one or more phases of the problem. The purpose of congress ought to be and probably will be to combine as many of these features in one bill as possible. The revival, of the war finance board's functions will help, though it is not Unlikely the president will decline to carry out the directions of congress in this matter as he did in the Jones shipping Into, which was in tended to reach the same end. A tariff on wheat and corn would help, though il would not get past flue president, aiul it qw stlonahle if the democrats, in congress would forego tlieir traditional heresies sufficiently to pass such a measure over a veto. The middleman end the speculator in farm commodi ties may be responsible for the farm disasters of the present, time. If they are, lcgl.-lalion which figuratively hangs them as high as Hainan must be cractcd. If it is found that dealing ill futures robs the producers, the agen cies of such dealings must be exter minated. If they are not, the truth ought to be determined so that the real cause could be found.
