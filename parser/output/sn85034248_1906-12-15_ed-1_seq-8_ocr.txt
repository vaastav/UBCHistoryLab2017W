CANAL, Wholesoie Res1tlts Likely to Follow the President's Visit-Improved Sanitary and Administrative Conditions. The Scientific American, a strictly non-partisan *and wholly reliable paper, publishes the following article under the caption, "The President at Panama:" The recent visit of the president to the Isthmus of Panama was both timely and stimulating. It occurred at a dis tinctly critical period in the affairs of the canal. Sweeping changes were being made, both in the methods of construction and the system of admin istration of the canal, the construction being about to pass into the hands of the contractors, and the administra tion being simplified, placed under one-man control and located definitely and permanently at the Isthmus. To this new departure the visit of Presi dent Roosevelt lends special signifi cance. Although Mr Roosevelt spent but a few days on the Isthmus, the time was busily employed; and, apart from the encouragement which was af forded to the employees by the pres ence of the chief executive in person, the president himself has undoubtedly acquired a firmer grasp upon the situ ation, and will find his personal ob servations of great value in arriving at future decisions on the many difii cult points which must arise during the actual work of construction. The present occasion marks the close of the second and the opening of the third chapter in the history of the Panama enterprise. The first chapter included the long and exhaustive ex amination of the physical conditions of the Isthmus, with a view to deter mining the best location for a canal, and resolved itself mainly into the de termination of the relative merits of Nicaragua and Panama. That work in itself was of great magnitude, and involved the creation of various com missions and boards, and the putting through of costly surveys by large engineering forces. The subsequent decision in favor of Panama was fol lowed by negotiations for the purchase of the rights and properties of the French company, and the securing of the necessary concessions from the Colombian government. Out of tne negotiations and seemingly inevitable intrigues that followed, sprang the young republic of Panama, friendly to the United States and anxious to do everything that lay in its power to fur ther, in the way of concessions and agreements, the prosecution of the work. The second chapter contains the story of the vast work of preparation which was necessary before the actual work of excavation could be put into full swing. The strip of the canal zone, ten miles in width, stretching from ocea, to ocean, was found to be a veri tible breeding place of disease; unsan itary, ill provided with pure drinking water, and because of the prevalence of yellow fever and malaria, fatal to the health of many the thousands of la borers who would have to be crowded upon the work, if it were to be finished on time. During this second period an efficient sanitary corps was formed, and under its systematic methods the canal zone has been cleaned up, yel low fever practically eradicated, and malaria so far brought under control that the zone is now pronounced by engineers of high standing, who have been engaged for a year or more upon the work, to be no more threatening to health than many of our southern states. Concurrently with the sanita tion of the Isthmus, the great problem of housing and feeding the canal em ployees has been successfully solved, and comfortable quarters and good board are now obtained at reasonable rates. Another question, equally vital to the success of the enterprise, is that of administration. There is no denying that, here, many mistakes have been made, and that the earlier operations were hampered by a system that was altogether too cumbersome and slow to suit the very special conditions that are to be found at the Isthmus. The resignation of the then chief en gineer, Mr. Wallace, served toempha size the fact that, if the best results were to be secured, and the whole of the complicated organization were to work together harmoniously, the control of it must be placed in the hands of one man, who should be permanently lo cated at the Isthmus, and have abso lute authority in all matters pertain ing to the construction of the canal. One of the most happy results of the president's visit has been the signing of an executive order concentrating the authority in the canal construction in one man, and giving him supreme jurisdiction over the heads of the seven departments of the administra tion. Both the chairman and the de partment heads will have their resi dence at the Isthmus, and will be in a position to push the work through without, as before, having to make continual references to higher author ity located at Washington, many thousand miles away. The Isthmian Canal Commission, which we under stand is also to be reorganized, will make quarterly trips to the Isthmus for the purpose of receiving reports and-advising with the chairman and the heads of departments. The third and longest chapter in the history of the canal opens with the wise decision of the government to undertake the huge task of active construction by contract, and not by day labor supervised by the goveru ment engineers. The Scientific Amer ican has always urged that this was the only practical way in which this work could be done. Some time may be consumed before the govern ment and the contractors can decide upon that final f~orm of contract and those questions of price and time which are mutually agreeable. But once this has been determined, we be lieve that the canal will be put through steadily to a final completion. Enough has been learned, however, from the preliminary work, to make it certain that congress mast be prepared for the exercise of great liberality and pa tience;, for the work will undoubtedly coast mncv more, and take longer by severa'yearts o complete than was or iginally estimated.

RACE QUESTION, Prejudice Fostered for Political Purposes. Negro Calnnishness Illnstrated--Race Problems Giving Trouble in Other Countries. Two weeks ago The Chief printed some sensible and unprejudiced views on the race problem from the editorial columns of the American Review of Reviews, and from the same high source we quote the following addi tional comments: The race question in our southern states continues to be discussed in that intense spirit to which we called at tention in these pages last month. Politicians naturally took advantage of the race feeling to make capital for their parties or their candidates in the fights that preceded the balloting of November 6. In some southern states, as in Tennessee, race prejudice has been played upon to a most unwar ranted degree. In the state mentioned it was merely for the purpose of bring ing out the full Democratic vote, and thus defeating the Republican candi date for the governorship. The Hon. Henry Clay Evans made a good run under such circumstances, but was de feated by a plurality of 18,000 given to his able Democratic opponent, the Hon. Malcolm R. Patterson. At lMemphis and in the western part of the state, where the negro population is very large, the Democratic news papers were filled with alarming tales of negro plots to capture the polls, of mysterious negro emissaries inflam ing the mind i.- f the colored race, of negro companies drilling by night, and so on ad infinitum. The stranger at Memphis would have expected a bloody and fearsome election day; but all was as quiet and peaceful as a Sunday afternoon in rural New Eng land. It would scarcely be inaccurate to say that not a negro vote was of fered at the polls in any portion of the country where the feeling against ne groes had been strongly expressed. In the course of time the educated negro who holds property will find his way to a share in the government of the community in which he lives. But for the present he will be wise to for get politics and give his attention to those preliminaries which will make him a respected and influential citizen. There can never be any absolute solu tion for the difficulties that are in herent in such a condition as exists where two races totally different live in the same communities. But there are approximate solutions which cool headed and sensible men can agree upon and which the south must accept for its own salvation. Fortunately, the governors and leading men of the southern states are not only talking against mobs and lynching, but they are doing a great deal to give practi cal effect to their expressed opinions. The south will pass out of its alarmist mood; it will accept modern views about universal education, and it will surmount its difficulties. The story of our recent business progress in this country, the amazing proportions of which are set forth in this number of the Review by Mr. Edmonds, of the Manufacturers' Record, applies more especially to the south than to any other part of the country. With the change in the south from a country of poverty to a land of prosperity, there will be a -growth of civilization all along the line, and this will help to lessen the causes of friction between the races. The tendency to race clannishness, by the way, was illustrated last month in the remarkable discipline visited upon three companies- of the twenty fifth regiment, colored, of United States Infantry. These soldiers were stationed at Brownsville, Texas. There had been some local difficulties in volving an attack upon citizens, which was traced to soldiers of this com mand. Very few of the soldiers, pre sumably, were guilty, but a thorough investigation showed that whole com panies of negro troops would stand together to protect the guilty rather than do their duty as soldiers and citizens in a case where negroes had assailed white men. This clannish. ness has been shown innumerable times in the history of the black race. It is, of course, not peculiar to that element of our population. Indians would doubtless act in the same way under like conditions, and so would the Chinese. But we have not very many Indians or Chinese in this coun try, and we have ten millions of peo ple with African blood in their veins. President Roosevelt has punished these companies of troops by order ing the dishonorable discharge of every man of them from the army. Their good record in Cuba has been urged in their behalf, and many peo ple in the north have been signing petitions for their reinstatement. But the president would seem to have acted in the only way possible, in view of the necessities of military discipline. The incident merely illustrates the difficulties that are involved in the settlement of matters in which the race question enters as an important factor. It is necessary, however, to believe that in spite of difficulties it is well worth while to have faith in a better condition, and to work for improve ment and progress. Reports from Cuba would make it appear that be hind the scenes the race question has played a considerable part in the em broilments which have led to our pres ent intervention there, and in various parts of the world-South Africa con spicuously just now-the difficulties between white people and those of other color are affording great per plexity to statesmen and to reformers and moralists.
