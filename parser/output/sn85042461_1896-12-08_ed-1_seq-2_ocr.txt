2 the table, the senate, on motion of Mr. Hale (Republican, Maine) adjourned. IN THE HOUSE. The Scene was Brilliant. But the Pro- ceedings Dull. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 —While ihe scenes attending the opening of the house today were both brilliant and in teresting, in the crowds that thronged the galleries and the conspicuous per sonages present, the proceedings them selves were dull and spiritless, being distinctively routine. The galleries to which the public is admitted without cards were crow del before 11 oclock, while the halls were Jammed with those unable to get In. Pages were scurrying about, carrying to members floral pieces from their con stituents or admiring friends. Among the members thus honored was Sir. Loud of California. Rev. Cowder of Michigan, chaplain of the house, offered a simple but impres sive prayer. Roll call showed the presence of 271 members, and the usual formal resolu tion for the appointment of a committee to Join a similar committee of the sen ate to inform the president that the house was ready for business was adopt ed. The speaker appointed Cannon of Illinois, Payne of New York, Turner of Georgia. The house took a recess until 1:30 oclock, and a further recess until 2 oclock. w hen Mr. Pruden, the president's executive, clerk, presented the messag i, which was read: The opening words of the message congratulating the country on the re sult of the election created a broad smile, the Democrats is well as the Re publicans seemingly enjoying the po litical condition which allowed a Demo cratic president to felicitate himself upon a victory gained under the banner ot the Republican party. The presi dent's expressions on Cuba and Vene zuela, were listened to attentively, but there were no demonstrations, even when he announced that the administra tion some months ago hail suggest, d home rule for Cuba to Spain or when he announced the termination of the controversy between eireat Britain an I the United States over the Venezuelan boundary line. I There was not much interest in the re mainder of the message, except those portions relating to the tariff, the cur rency and trusts. The reading of the message occupied one hour and forty minutes. At its conclusion, em motion j of Mr. Dingley. Republican, of Maine, the message and accompanying docu ments were referred to the committee of the whole on the state of the union. Mr. Grow. Republican, of Pennsylvania showed a disposition to debate the mes sage, but yielded until a later time. Mr. Turner, Democrat, of Georgia then formally announced the "untimely death" of his late colleague, ex-Speaker Crisp, and stated that at some future day he would ask the house to fix a day for paying tribute to "his distinguished character and eminent service." A res olution presented by him reciting that the house had heard with profound re gret the announcement of Mr. Crisp's death, was adopted, after which, at 3:45 p. m., as a further mark of respect, the house immediately adjourned until to morrow.

OLNEY'S REPORT The Cuban Situation Cannot Be Con- tinued Indefinitely WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.—Fnr the fu st time within tlie memory of the oldest officials the secretary of .stale has made a regular report to the president for transmission to congress, like tbe reports of other officers of the cabinet. The re port was laid before congress today as an appendix to the president's message, It treats on many details of our relations during the past year with foreign gov ernments not touched upon at all in the message or more briefly treated. Olney sets out In detail the story of the growth of the Cuban rebellion; the present evil state of affairs in the island and other facts upon which the president based his broad statement and conclusions. The secretary's estimate of the situation Is disclosed In the following paragraph, made after the preliminary statement of the destruction of the Industrial re sources of Cuba: "From whatever point of View we re gard the matter, it Is Impostble not to discern that a state of things exists nt our doors alike dangerous to good rela tions, destructive to legitimate com merce, fatal to the Internal revenue of Cuba and most vexatious and trying be cause entailing on this government ex cessive burdens In its domestic adminis tration and in its outward relation*. This situation cannot indefinitely continue Without growing still worse. and the time may not be far distant when the I'nited States must seriously consider whether its rights and interests, as well as Its International duties, in view of its pecu liar relations to the island, do not call for some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued." The secretary makes it plain that the present Insurrection is far more formid able than the famous "ten years' in surrection" which began at Yara In 1868. He says that, starting in the same por tion of the island, it very early took pro portions beyond its predecessor and as sumed the aggressive phase. Passing the defensive lines of the I trocha* traversing tin- Island from north to south, formidable bodies of the revo | lutior.ary forces early lv the year estab j Ilshed themselves In the rich sugar plan i tatton* of Santa Clara and Cienfuegos. made hostile forays almost in sight of Havana itself, and advancing forward effected a lodgment In the fertile tobacco Holds of Plnar del Rio, where they have frustrated ail efforts of the Spanish army to overcome them. The secretary says that while as yet no prominent ports have been attacked by the insurgents, a large portion of the 2~,00 miles of tlie coast is practically in their hands, and from its rugged and wild character is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla warfare ar.d affords easy means ot lauding clan destine supplies of men and arms. The secretary adds: "While thus in fact controlling a large part of the island from Cape Can Antonio to Cape Maisi and enjoying practically unlimited use I of an equally large part of the coast, the revolutionary forces are scattered, being never united for any length of time to form ffn army capable of attack and siege and fit to take the defensive In a. pitched buttle. Assembling suddenly at a given point, often in a single night, they make unexpected sallies or carry destruction to the tobacco and cane fields of Cuba, and at the first sign of pursuit or organized assault, they dis perse, only to re-assemble in like man ner ut some other spot." As bearing on the question of recogni tion of the insurgents, which is to come in some shape before congress, the fol lowing statement from Secretary Olney is of importance In explaining his rea sons for declining recognition: ' "So far as our information shows, there is not only no effective local gov ernment by the insurgents In the terri tory they overrun, but there is not even a tangible pretense to establish admin istration anywhere. Their operation is confined to the shifting exigencies of th* military operations of the hour; is no madic, without definite centers, and lacking the most elementary features of municipal government. There no where appears the nucleus of statehood. The machinery for the exercise of legit imate rights and powers of sovereign ty and responding to the obligations which de facto sovereignty entails In the fact of equal rights of other states, is con spicuously lacking. It is not possible to discern a homogeneous political entity, possessing and exercising the functions of administration, and capable if left to itself of maintaining orderly govern ment In its own territory and sustain ing normal relations with the external family of governments." The secretary illustrates his point as to the irresponsibility of the insurgents by citing their destruction of American plantations and their oppression of American planters who grind cane.which he characterizes as acts of anarchy. On the other hand he shows that in the cap ital cities and seaports and all parts of the Island with which the I'nited States or Its citizens maintain legitimate Inter course, the Spanish power is supreme, though often exercised in a vexatious and arbitrary way. calling forth just re monstrance, and that most of the func tions of government proceed as in time of peace. Recurring to his comparison of Vis Insurrection with those that have pre ceded it. Secretary Olney makes this significant statement: "From every ac cessible indication it Is clear the pres ent rebellion is on a far more formida ble scale as to numbers, intelligence and representative features: that the cor responding effort of Spain for its re pression has been enormously augment ed. and that, despite the constant influx ■of fresh armies and material of war from the metropolis, the rebellion, after nearly two years of successful resist ance, appears today to be in a condition to indefinitely prolong the contest on its present lines." He also compliments the tactical skill display.-.! lo- the leaders of the insurrec tion, saying that when the disparity of numbers and the comparatively inde fensible character of the central and western Vega country are considered the passage of a considerable force into Plnar del Rio, followed by its successful maintenance there for many months must he regarded as a military suoe,. K s of a pronounced character. "The insurgent armies," snys the sec retary, "fairly represent the'intelligent aspirations of a large proportion of th» people nf the whole island: and it Is , .shown that they purpose to wage the | contest on these better grounds of van • tage to the end. and to make the present ; struggle a supreme test of the capacity ;or the Cuban people to win for them | .selves and' their children the heritage of i self-government." ! The secretary speaks of the appalling | phases of the struggle, such as often ap , pear In contests among the Latin races iof the western hemisphere: of the cx i cesses and forceful and arbitrary acts I of the military: of the ravaging of pri | vats property, the violation of principles j of civilized warfare by irresponsible of j fieials. and the killing of non-eombal j ants. In some Instances, happily few, of I American citizens. He says: "A large I part nf the correspondence of the stale j department with its agents in Cuba has I been devoted to these cases of assaults ion the rights nf our citizens. In no in | stance has earnest remonstrance and ! energetic appeal been omitted. Rut the I representatives of Spanish power often i find it easily practicable to postpone cX i planatlons and reparation on the ground I of alleged Ignorance of facts or for other j plausible reasons." The secretary next treats at length i of the financial and industrial losses In i dieted upon American citizens by the j continuance of the strife, all of which is | summed up concisely by the president in ; a portion of his message. That part of I the report devoted to Cuba concludes I with a brier statement of the Competl ] tor case, which, it appears, has now been | remanded hy the Madrid authorities for retrial, and a statement of the dissent !of the state department from the re- I quirement of the governor-general of Cuba that all aliens in Cuba shall be reg istered within a certain time under pain of disbarment from the protection of law 

VENEZI' EI,AN QUESTION. Secretary Olney says very little more. than does tho president in his messag* respecting the Venezuelan houriduiy question. He announces with gratifica tion that amicable counsels' have pre vailed to Induce satisfactory attempts at an Understanding, and that the boundary question and its associated phases have been at iast eliminated tta between this country ar.d England, ill gives, however, no inkling of the nature of the treaty beyond the statement that it provides for honorable arbitration of the whole controversy. He adds; liOS ANOEIiES 

HERALD: TUESDAY MOBNINO. "No doubt ts entertained that Vent- I zuela. which has so earnestly sought the friendly assistance of the United State* toward the settlement of this vexation a contention and which has unresevedly confined its interests to tho Impartial judgment of this government, will av sent to the formal adjustment thus at - tamed, thus forever ending a dispute involving far-reaching consequences to the peace and welfare of the western continent." BRITISH RELATIONS. Touching the negotiations for a gen eral arbitration treaty for the settle ment of all future disputes between fixe United. States antl Great Britain, Sec retary Olney says that both countries having given repeated proof of their ac quiescence in the great principle In volved, not only by treaties between themselves, but severally by concluding like adjustments with- other powers for the adjudication of disputes resting on law and fact, the subject was naturally approached in a benevolent spirit of agreement and the negotiations have aa satisfactorily progreseeel as to fore shadow a practical agreement at an early date upon the text of a convention to the desired end. The secretary ex pressed regret that the British govern' ment has refused Its concurrence In a proposed international commission to devise means to protect the seal herds; recites the findings of the experts in ef fect showing that the herd is threaten ed wilh total destruction unless changes are made* speedily in the award regula tions, and hopes that the expert's re port will Induce the British government to agree upon these conditions. The report shows that negotiations are in progress for a convention to locate immediately that part of the Alaskan boundary lino along the 141 st meridian by monuments and joint surveys, while the prospects for the precise demnika- [ tion of tlie coast line boundary are said to be good. A preliminary survey hay- J ing been completed and negotiations based*en it about to be undertaken, it Is announced that the assent of Great Britain nnd other maritime states hav ing been secured, tho new rules for tlie prevention of collisions at sea will go into effect July Ist next. GERMAN AFFAIRS Under the head of Germany, the report treats briefly of the exclusion from that country of American meat products, Tiie situation apparently remains un changed, ns there has been no ameliora tion of the stringent measures adopted by Germany "on assumed grounds of public health" against our cattle. "On the contrary." says the secretary, "the disposition of Germany, visible for a number of years past, to still further impede and virtually inhibit this legit imate traffic, is evidenced by fresh re strii live measures, The unjustlfiablltty and the erroneousness of the Bupposi d premises on which they rest have been again pointed out, and the healthful ness of our exports Supported by con clusive proof." The secretary says there are fair pros pects of the ultimate removal of the in terdiction on American lifo insurance companies seeking to do business In Germany. The subject, of the re-imposition of ton nage dues on German vessels is dis cussed compactly, to show that the law was mandatory upon the president to is sue his proclamation as soon as the facts were established. 

SOUTH SEA ISLANDS. Hawaii comes in for a single short par agraph in the report, stating that no questions of importance have arisen, that a few claims for indemnity have been tiled in behalf of United States cit izens arrested during the last rebellion, and that the final chapter in the his tory of that attempted revolt was reached in the pardon of the ex-queen. Samoa is also briefly treated, the sit uation being unchanged, and tlie United States necessarily continuing to exer cise all stipulated rights and duties un der the tripartite general act of Berlin, during the continuance of the compact, however irksome and unnatural these rights and duties may prove to be. AMERICANS ABROAD. An explanation of the difficulties that arise in connection, with the effort to protect United States naturalized citi zons, naturally Jews, who return to Russia, is afforded by the following par agraph : "Holding to the old doctrine of perpet ual allegiance, refusing to lessen its au thority by concluding any treaty recog nizing the naturalization of a Russian subject without prior imperial consent, asserting the extreme right to punish a naturalized Russian on return to his native jurisdiction, net merely for un authorized emigration, but also specific ally for the unpermitted acquisition of a foreign citizenship, and sedulously ap plying.at home and through the official I acts of its agents abroad, to all persons of the Jewish belief, the stern restric tions enjoined by Russian law, the gov- ' ernment of Russia takes a ground not i admitting of acquiescence by the I'nited States, because at variance with the character of our institutions, the sen timents of our people, the provisions of our statutes, and the tendencies of mod ern international comity." Nevertheless, the secretary says, the differences that arise are compromised In worthy cases by the friendly disposi tion of Russia toward our country and people, GENERAL COMMENT Other points in the report may be briefly summarized as follows: The Ar gentine Republic has settled the Hale claim by offering to pay an indemnity; arrests of naturalized Americans re turning to Austria are becoming less frequent; efforts continue for the remo val of restrictions on the importation of j American cattle into Belgium: there are ! prospects of a speedy conclusion of ar rangements for the completion of the work left unfinished by the Chilian claims committee in ISU4; the Chines: ! government has settled all Claims of Americans for loss through the anti- ■ foreign riots and it is expected that that government will soon consent to the for- ' lr.al recognition of the rights of Ameri- . can missionaries and teachers to full i protection In their work and property; the claim of Julio Santos against Ecua dor, standing for a Quarter of.a century, haa been settled directly between the ! parties on the eve of arbitration; the ! French government has promised the fullest extension to American citizens and interests tn Madagascar of all rights under present treaties between France and the I'nited States, so our consuls In Madagascar are relinquishing extra territorial Jurisdiction: it la suggested that our minister resident at Haytl and San Domingo be raised to the grade of plenipotentiary! the Italian government is estopped from claiming indemnity for I the Italians kiled at Hahnvilie. La., last June by reason of the fact that they had j voted in state elections and so abandoned , the Italian citizenship: the extension for ore year of the functions of the Mexican boundary committee in order to allow it : to pass upon important issues of irri gation and storage dams on the Rio Grande river is noted; the Peruvian gov ernment has settled the claim of certain American citizens employed by a hydro graphic commission by the payment of 20,000 soles: a naturalisation treaty is j to he negotiated with Switzerland, which lias so far refused to admit the right of expatriation of its citizens; extradltii n treaties have been concluded with the Argentine and the Orange Free State and will be submitted to the senate; es timates have been collected for the cosl of acquiring suitable buildings lor the permanent occupancy of each of our em bassies and legations abroad: and a more commodious building especially designed tor the needs of tho state department is ri commended.

He will re sign this place, as he has been more act ive than many of the others In their re cent campaign, ami was one of the most urgent In advocacy of a bolt at St. Louis. There has been a tendency among some Republicans to pursue a conciliatory course toward the silver Republicans, and especially as a number of them have declared in favor of protection, and Sen ator Mantle's paper has been quite posi tive In this direction. H leant believed either Senators P.ttigrew or Mantle or Can;] in w ill attend the caucus, though they would not he required to Indicate j their views.

As wa.s expected, another delay resulted, the matter going over for two weeks. It will be remembered that the court threw a bombshell Into the ramp of Mesrs. Dickinson and Dettprey, attorneys for Durrant, by declaring the case sub mitted wjthout the briefs of the defend ant having been (lied. The attorneys claimed they did not have time to pre pare the briefs and immediately asked that the order be dismissed nnd that Durrant be given another opportunity to file his briefs. This atter came up today for settlement. On this occasion the delay was caused by Attorney General Fitzgerald. When the calendar was called he arose and moved for a continuance, saying that he had exercised due diligence but never theless was unable to prepare the briefs to be submitted by the people In the case. The desired continuance was granted. It Is Impossible to foretell when a de cision will be rendered by the court, in asmuch as the case has not yet been for mally submitted. Meanwhile Durrant is threatened with the frightful possi bility of dying of old age behind prison bars. BOUGHT A HOUSE. NEWPORT.
