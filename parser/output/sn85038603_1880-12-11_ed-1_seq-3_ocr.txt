Just as we go to press our communi ty is in deep distress at the death of our prominent and distinguished townsman Capt. J. N. Atkinson. Our limited space will not permit of a no tice that could possibly do justice to his memory, which we will attempt in our next issue. Summit Times. Few men in the State of Mississippi were better entitled to the high char acter designated by the phrase, "a good man." He was a successful merchant, and an industrious and ac complished business man, but his for tune was sadly impaired, if not des troyed by too great a disposition to lift up the fallen and aid the needy Full of generosity, he was an easy victim to the appeals of those in want. There are to-day, scattered all over the counties of South Mississippi, scotch of men and women, who will call to their minds many acts of dis interested liberality from bis hands, and will pay to his memory the tribute of a tear. A genial friend, a useful and public-spirited citizen, a loving father and husband were lost when the cold soil covered the re mains of Capt. J. N. Atkinson Jones' philosophy is not bounded by a thanksgiving dinner in the figura tive sense of the phrase. He has been an editor too long not to be able to appreciate the sustaining force of a vivid imagination where there is noth ing but air for it to act on. When, therefore, a thanksgiving ep.cli oc curs, and the turkey eat non, or when Jones' affections run out and are pro fusely and liberally distributed among eleven hundred delinquent subscri lers, and lie calls upon them in the most touching and endearing language to "come up," and, like the spirits of the vasty deep, they don't come, Jones lias a remedy in either case. In the difficulty about the turkey he takes his revenge out on an honest pie ce of roast beef, and demonstrates to the satisfaction of his anxious readers that a true and dignified pa triot can be abundantly thankful on beof and sweet potatoes. In fact, he undertakes to prove, and does ably sustain the grand historical proposition that sweet potatoes are the original vegi tables which started the growth of patriotism in America. He trium phantly cites the case of Gen. Francis Marion, of South Carolina, one of the gieat founders, pioneers and defenders of liberty, and shows the effect which sweet potatoes had on him He con tends that the patriotism produced by the modern sweet potato is as genuine as it was in the days of Marion, and emphatically explodes the theory that there is any gasseous deterioration of the growth. In reference to the circumstance of the unanimous absence of the delin quents, be is equal to that too. That sort of vote does not make him blue. He reasons himself over the seeming neglect to respond to his affectionate overtures. These delinquents are strong personal friends, and they are only waiting for their subscriptions to grow large enough to enable Jones to become opulent and easy when they do pay up. If they should recklessly rusli forwaul and pay up now, the amounts are comparatively small, and Jones could manage to squander every one of them before he invested in United Stales bonds ; and iq our opin ion lie would be sure to do it, because we know him to be the soul ol liber ality. If a friend of his needs a dol lar Jones will lend it to him if he lias to borrow it from somebody else. The delinquents know this, and they per haps, intend to take care of Jones in spite of him. After lie tuns the Ad vance until lie gets as old as the Vet eran of the Mercury, who started out on his jourualietie career when the morning stars liegan to sing, he will have an amount due him worth talking about. Then when a delinquent does happen to pay up lie can buy a bond and provide for his old age. rhere is nothing like philosophy, but it takes a good article of it to look far enough ahead to see wealth from the ever-aeumulating "claims for de linquent subscriptions. Jones, how ever, has the gift, and therein lies the beautiful serenity of his temper. THE ADVISOEY COMMITTEE. A VETERAN DEMOCRAT'S VIEWS OX Tilt; POLICY OF KLKCTIX A URATE ELECTOR To the Poaltlou of President tnl Mm. nam igmr, THE WHOLE SUBJECT SHELL. IN A N UT AH exchange says, "There is a con siderable interest taken in the ques tion of calling an extra session of the Legislature together this winter. It is an offyear in our destiny, and when ever an exigency like that comes around our sotons should give the peo ple the lienelil of their views on nation al and in tenia tianal questions, and modify existing relations so as to make them conform to the logic of events. Gov. Stone will probably consult the wisiies of the people before he concludes to call an extra session, as also the imperious necessity of the movement, and in the present con dition of affairs and the increasingly threatening proximity of Jupiter and other foreign powers we think it would be advisable for him to call the legis lature together for a few days at least." All we have to say is, if the Gov ernor can resist t hat he is Stone indeed. BOMS years ago an enthusiastic friend of the Brandon Republican got away over to Colorado and wrote back to ask Col. Frautz if he wanted some thing to "till up" with, meaning news and views for his paper, of course, Col. Frantz promptly replied : "yes ; I do want something to fill upon, and want it bad. Send me a barrel of flour and a keg of Ieer !" Lately, however, the taste of Ilie Co), goes out in the direc tion of fodder. He calls on his delin quents to "come up," and if they can't do any better bring fodder enough to pay their subscriptions. It is the first instance which has yet come to our notice where an editor delilierately made up his mind to try experiment of living on fodder. At the suggestion of the Governor durtngthe last session of the Legisla ture a suggestion which propahly he would be glad to recall now an Ad visory Committee was appointed by the Democratic caucus to confer With the Governor in relation to the advis ability cf calling the Legislature in special session. Our usually acccurate cotemporary of the Vicksburg Com mercial is in error in the statement tiiat the Legislature appointed this committee. It was the work of the Democratic caucus. The committee consists of the following distinguished Democrats : First District David Johnson, J. W. Buchanan and W. W. Humphries. Second District J. H. Dalton, C. B. Howry and W. S. Fcatherston. Third District W. H. FitzGerald, J. E. Bridges, and J. A. Currie. Fourth District . M. Hicks, M. Lvle and Frank C. McGee. Fifth District Ben. King, A. J. Me Luurin, and T. B. Ford. Sixth District J. B. Perkins, F. A. Montgomery and J. McC. Martin. State at Carge. John D.Bills and J P. Carte . Brat. Kino, Chairman. Frank C, McGkk, Secretary-. In the meeting here of the Commit tee on Wednesday, there were present Hon. Ben. King, Chairman, Hon. J. McC. Martin, Hon. F. A. Mont gomery, Hon. C. M. Howry, and Hon. Frank Met fee. No action was taken because so few members were present, except to meet, talk a little, and ad journ subject to the call of the Chair man. We learn that some difference exists in the views of members who were present, and the indication now is that there will be no great pressure on the Governor to call an extraordi nary session. COLUMBUS. Ylckshurg Commercial. The Presidential Electors for Missis sippi, who met last Wednesday, after east ing the eight votes of the State for Gen. Hancock, for President, and Mr. English for Vice-President, elected one of their own somber, (the Hon. c. B. Mitchell, of Pontotoc.) m Sanger to curry the vote to Washington, and deliver it in person to the President of the Senate of the United state. In this selection of a messenger we must say that our electors did neither a gracious nor a graceful a(,t There are at least a hundred young, ardcut and active Demo crats in the State who would have accepted the position of messenger as a compliment, ami to one of those it should have been given. It would have afforded an active young worker for the right, an opportu nity to visit the capital of the country at an Interesting period, and to such an one the position should have been offered. We have not the houor to be a personal ac quantanee of Mr. Mitchell, but all that we have heard of him is in his favor. He is reputed to be a gentleman, a sound Dem ocrat, a man of line ability, and a forcible, pleasing speaker. We hold, however, that in being made a Presidential Elector, he was sufficiently honored, and should have been content, lie should have been above asking his co-electors for a paltry, subordi nate place, and tlie should have had the firmness to have refused his demand. It was not graceful nor gracious for hiin to ask it, and it should have been promptly denied. It is this selfish and inordinate greed for place and the small emoluments pertaining thereto, manifested by men holding official position, that pro i aces dry rot in parties and leads to inevitable defeat. We take take it that Mr. Mitchell was nominated for the position of Presidential Elector for two reasons. One was that he desired the place, and the other that he was able to render efficient service in the campaign. It was not deemed likely, however, that after being thus honored, Mr. Mitclfell would demand or accept the insignificant subordinate position of Mes senger." It was not presumed that any irniiH.iimiri linlmnul with i 1 1 1 i 1 1 i 1 1 t i . 1 1 f'..i- Elector, would desire to be the servant of his peers in the body of which he was member, and least of all utilize the pres tige of Ins position by influencing his col leagues to give him another place. This sort ol' close corporation business, of which there has been a great abundance in Mississippi, leads to revolt in the Demo cratic organization, to the disruption of party ties and the obstruction of party dis cipline. To look at the newspapers, and read the laudat ions ladled out to Smith, and Jones, and Jenkins and Simpkins, a stranger Would come to the conclusion that the State of Mississippi, with its million and a quarter of people contains not more than a dozen men qualified lor the position of United States Senator, Representative in Congress, Governor or any other State of- nee. Let Jcukius, simpkius, Smith, or Jones, once get into an official position, however, ami he clings to it with the per sistent tenacity of the old man of the sea. and no intellect, however exalted, no service, however great, no patriotism, however pure and elevated, stands the remotest chance for preferment while these old men of the sea are allowed to ring tin changes on their own superhuman merits. sacrifices and services. We hear a little bird singing a strain that bodes relief from the death clutch of these old meu of the sea. That strain tells us that the young bioou of t lie country is coming to the lront, that blood, which, flowing from the veins of the gallant dots who while carrviuj; muskets and wielding sabers, crimsoned a hundred battle fields, will supplant the sluggish, vital stream now controlling pub- lie atlairs in .Mississippi. Ify Heaven, it Were worth ten years of strife to see a man who carried a musket enter the capitol at ashmgton as a .senator, or a Kepresenta five, or walk into the Statebonse at Jack son, as Chikv Magistrate of the dear old State of Mississippi! Improbable as this may seem to some, we shall live to see it We shall live to see a battalion of chronic maundering, office seeking, fossils, ordered to the rear, and in the successful perform ance of that movement lies the redemption of Mississippi. I hat done, and the Statt takes a long stride in a new direction, on the road to wealth, power, improvement, happiness and prosperity. May Heaven speed the hour when we can hear the order "about face, to the real-. MARCH !'" THE WAHRKN Ol TV Ml ) lil t: LUCID AMD FULL STATEMENT THE LAW AND THE FACTS.

The action of the Commissioners of Elec tion of Warren county, Mississippi, in re fusing to count, at the recent election, a number of ballots because they were not such as were prescribed by the law of this State, having been denounced by the Re publican organs, condemned by some of toe so-called Independent press, and even disapproved by some Democratic papers, under a misapprehension, as I believe, of the law and the facts, aud these unfavor able expressions having emboldened the partisan Republican District Attorney of the Tinted States for this District of this State to prosecute by an illegal informu tion the Commissioners for enforcing the law, and the Chairmen of the Democratic Congressional and County Executive Com mittees for advising them as to that law, a sense of justice to these gentlemen, as Well as a desire that our party and people may nol be unjustly affected In the public esti mation, nor the right of Gen. Chalmers to his seat in Congress prejudiced by this false- clamor, impels me to call attention to the true state of the case. The lie vised Code (1880) of this State pro vides by section 137 as follows : g 137. AH ballots shall he written, or printed, in hlack i uk, with a space of not less than onepfifth of an inch between each name, on plain white news (trinting ajer, not more than two and one-half nor ass than two and one-fourth inches wide, without any device or mark by which one ticket may be known or distinguished from another, except tue words at the head of the tickets, but lids shall not prohibit the erasure, correction or insertion of any name by encil-iuark or ink upon the face of the ballot and a ticket different from that herein pre scribed sha'l not le received or counted. That was and is the law of this State, and the right of the State to regulate the exer cise by its citizens of the elective franchise In this manneiis not questioned by writers on this subject, irrespective of their polit ical opinions, or theories of the scope or the construction of the Federal aud State Con stitutions. No one ever denied the power of the State to prescribe the qualifications of voters and to reirulate the manner of exercising the so-called "right of suffrage" in tile election of its own State, county and municipal officers the only limitation upon that power being the ftfleeuth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits the denial or abridgment of the right of any "citizens of the United States" (whatever that may mean) to vote "on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." And this power extends to Congressional elections, for by the second section of the first Article of the Constitution of the United States it is 5escibed that iu an election of Represen tatives in Congress "the electors in each State shall have the qualifications-requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State Legislature; and by the fourth section of the same Article, it is provided that the manner of electing members of Congress shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof," thus apply ing the State laws to the election of members of Congress. This election law is no invention of "Southern ingenuity." Iu adopting it our Mississippi solons simply borrowed from our Yaukee self-constituted schoolmasters. A law to this effect was first made. I believe by Massachusetts in 1849, afterwards adopt ed by a number of Northern States, and among others by the great President man ufacturing State of Ohio, as the following from the Ohio Code of" 1880, passed, I be lieve, by the very men who elected General Garfield to the United States Senate, will snow : 2 2MB.

Fntal Boiler Explosion. special to the N. O. Times. Shubuta. Mis., Dec. 4 John Dear man's gin boiler, six miles south of Shubuta, exploded at 11 o'clock last night, tearing the top of John Smith's head off, and scattering his brains for sixty feet. Elden Graham was also killed aud Dearman scalded to death. The boiler was an old one and coijsidr ered dangerous for some time. It is apparent that our statute is taken from the Ohio statute above quoted. Our statute is merely an improvement upon the above in verbiage and grammatical con struction, and more liberal as to the width of the ticket and more just iu the penaltv igainst illegal tickets, to-wit: loss of the vote, mstead of the punishment of the printer and voter. The policy of such laws is questionable ; ind it is the legitimate function of the press to discuss that question and by its mighty Influence upon public, opinion decide whether this law shall remain or be re pealed. But it should be borne in mind that such a law is declared by some of the ablest jur ists and purest publicists (the distinguished Judge Cooley among the number), to be iu furtherance of the end for the attainment of which the ballot was resorted to the tecrei expression of each voter. Such a law was first enacted iu Massachu setts to prevent the owners of mills, fac tories and workshops, aud other employers from owning the votes of their poor work men, operatives or laborers. That this is a worthy motive and in ac cord with the spirit of our popular institu tions cannot be denied. A similar neces sity exists among us for protection against like influences, for ou the one hand the negroes may, by the use of marked tickets, be voted en-masse by their Loyal League political masters, or ou the other, any voter may be spotted and compelled to vote in the way bia employer or landlord dictates, or else suffer the consequences of disobliging them. Another benefit which may be derived from such a law, is the removal of the facil. ity for fraud. It may sometimes be easy to take out of the ballot box a handful of tickets at a grab, if they are marked so as to be known or distinguished, whereas if they are not so marked it would be neces sary to the perpetration of this fraud that each ballot be separately opened and read, a thing requiring time and likely to be de tected. It is certain, however, that the officers of election had nothing to do with, uor were they responsible for the policy of the law. They were sworn to execute it as it was, and not as they might think it ought to be, and it was their duty under the law not to receive, or If received, not to count any ballot different from this one prescribed in section one hundred and thirty-seven. They did not count many because they deeided that those ballots were different some because they were not the proper width, and more because they bad marks or devices upon them by which they could be known or distinguished. In this decis ion honestly made, (and every oue familiar with the facts admits that it was,) they could not (even if they erred) be justly con demned, a fortiori, they should not have been abused, (especially by men who did not know all the facts,) their action de nounced as fraudulent and themselves as sociated with the rascally Louisiana Re turning Board. The charge of fraud would be ridiculous were it not that it may impose upon the ignorant or thoughtless. No fair analogy can be. drawn between the Louisiana Re turning Board and these commissioners. The former upon false and forged affidavits repudiated the return by which they should have been governed and under the pre tense (now urged against the action of the commissioners here) of "ascertaining the wi.H of the people" resorted to evidence ovftitlr the hijiil haltote aud reversed the re sult, the Latter canvassed the returns (as by law they must) and were governed by the facts apparent from an inspection of those returns. The oue did as the law directs and ascertained the number of legal ballots, the other in disregard of the law undertook to go behind the legal votes and ascertain the will of the people, not as expressed in the lawful manner, but as they might con sider it proper. Ify this very argument of "ascertaining the will of the people" was the lawfully expressed will of the people nullified and the fraud made possible. The facts as to the marked tickets are briefly these : 1. The' did hare a murk or devine upon thm by which they could be recognised not only by the face (which violates the law) but by the hack when folded. This was so apparent from inspection that it could not be denied. 2. Tiny wert actually htom um - tfwMC Ihnthy at the election. They were thereby selected by men who could not read, tallies were thereby kept dur ing election day by the Republican officers and managers. They ttert intended to known and dietim anieked. The Republicans had them print edMr. Lynch, as I am informed, stated to the Secretary of State that h corrected the proof. They differ not only from the Democratic but from the regular Republican tickets. They cost, as I am told, four times as much as the regular ticket. The negroes were told to rote that ticket, and to recog nize it by these marks. The managers were told by a Republican before the elec tion that this ticket was illegal, and w hen I was informed of the difference on election day I went to the liairman of the Repub lican Executive Committee :md warned him that they w ere illegal, and went to the polls and called the attention of the inspec tors to the law. It is evident that they had a purpose iu voting those tickets. What it was is imma terial. Perhaps they resorted to this de vice to enable them to vote the nej;ro, or perhaps they imagined that the Democrats might attempt to stuff the ballot boxes, and feariug to rely on the Republican inspec tors and clerks, selected by themselves, to prevent it, they resorted to this trick to enable them to detect it by proving that so many ballots of this particular kind went into the box. As 1 have already said oue of the very objects sought to be attained by this law was to prevent election bosses from knowing how the free people vote. If it was so plain that those ballots were legal as the howl of certain newspapers would indicate, why did not the United States District Attorney when lie in de feusc of the tiflhteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States constituted himself a one-horse Grand Jury, and on an illegal information had his fellow citizens arrested and tried for this affair charge the commis sioners with refusing to count legal votes? He charged them with omitting to return to the Secretary of state within ten days after the election the whole number of votes given in the county, and for this, (which was not true,) he asked to have them punished by the Federal Court (under an act of Congress which is believed to be a gross usurpation of authority) for their alleged omission to do their duty as State officers. He admitted that these ballots had marks or devices by w hich they could be distinguished, aud he based his argu ment wholly on these two grouuds : hirst, that the statute did not say iu section 140 (which provided for the return) the whole number of legal votes, (which Is a mere quibble for while it is true that the statute does not use those words In that particular section yet that statute had prescribed what votes should be legal and taken into account at all). Second, that the Inepectori and mot th, Uommieeioners were charged with the duty of enforcing Section 187. Iu other words not that the action was wrong but done by the wrong officers. I will not consume time aud space to an swer his second proposition but simply say tn pastant, that no one has yet been able to answer the admirable argument of At torney General Catchings or the brilliant reasoning of Judge Wiley 1". Harris, (two of the greatest lawyers to be found iu this or auy other State,) demonstrating that it w as the right aud duty of the Commission ers not to count illegal ballots. Judge Hill did uot attempt to discuss it. He simply In ex cat Led i a style '"laid down the law" as in hi opinion it should be construed, decided that the Commissioners had com milted no offence and then irave us his view of the power of the Commissioners which tea outside the cute. In fact it looks like the main oject of these prosecutions was to give the Federal Court a chance to express its opinion ou the State law. Judge Lea twice so stated to the Court. Was it intended to injuriously affect the contest lor the scat in Congress.' lo nve it a black eye," so to speak ? 1 dislike the idea that so liouorable a Court could be prostituted to such base purposes. Iu these proseciitious they evaded the real issue. The question the public is most interested in, is not the merely technical one which of these officers should have rejected those votes, but should they have been rejected at all. To illustrate how unfairly this matter has been placed before the public, I have only to mention that those papers which denounce the Commissioners for uot count ing those votes do not inform the public that many hundreds of these very tickets were rejected by the Inspectors who ac cording to the Federal Court had the law ful right to decide whether they were law ful votes. But they say "those were such little marks such small devices, (which translated means, "such cunning little tricks") "used iu place of a, comma," as the Vicksburg Herald disingenuously puts it. It being admitted that there was a mark or device, the test is, could the ballots be known or distinguished thereby. It is the province of the State and not of the Federal Courts to contsrue this elec tion law of the State ; and when the State Courts do construe it, tneir decision will be the law for the Federal Court and Congress. i . t 1 1 . it is iiaiuiuiioi any one uu Has not un voted much thought to the subject to as sume that any law is wrong which in the particular instance presented appears to deprive any oue of his rights, but it should be remembered not only that such an ob jection to a law, trom a hardship which mav sometimes chance to arise in its appli cation could be urged against all laws that man with his faliable intelligence and lim ited foresight has been able to frame, but also, that in the language of a great writer on this subject, "participation in the elective franchise is a privilege rather than a right," and that this privilege must be exercised in such manner and under such regulations as the State may prescribe: "The propriety, and indeed the necessity of such regulations, is undisputed." And again he says : "The intention ol the voter must be that which is expressed in due form of law." It is more natural, but not creditable, that some of our Southern newspapers should seek to avert the wrath of our Rad ical masters by disclaiming any responsi bility for this muddle in the Sixth District forgetting that they are furnishing our stalwart frte nds new grist for their slander mill PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.

Dermit me to say that if a partizan committee of a party majority shall dare to override the law of Missis sippi, it will be a sad reflection that the press the nursing-mother of liberty her alded that outrage upon our State. Yours, respectfully, M. Mahshai.i.. Washington. Dee. 5. The dent in his message says : I congratulate you on the continu ance and increasing prosperity of our country. By the fa vor of Divine Pro vidence we nave been blessed during the present year wilh health, with abundant harvests, with profitable, employment for all our people, and with contentment at home and with peace and friendship with other na tions. The occurrence of the twenty fourth election of Chief Magistrate has afforded another opportunity to the people of the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transmission of the power and authority of the gov ernment from the public servants whose terms of office are about lo ex pire to their newly chosen successors. This example cannot fail to impress profoundly thoughtful people of other countries with the advantages which Republican institutions afford. The immediate general and cheerful acqui escence of all good citizens in the result of the election, gives gratifying assur ance to our country aud to its friends throughout the world, that a govern ment based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people, pos sesses elements of strength, stability and permanency not found in any other form of government. Continued opposition to the full ami free enjoyment of the rights of citizen ship conferred upon colored men by the amendments to the constitution, still, prevails in several of the late slave-holding .States. It has, perhaps, not been manifested iu the recent elec tion to auy large extent in acts of vio lence or intimidation ; it has, however, by fraudulent practices in connection with ttie ballots, with regulations as to places and manner of voting, and with counting, returning aud canvassing votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the right and the pre servation of all rights, the right of suf frage which t'ie constitution expressly confers upon our enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor iu our polities should disappear. They prefer that no section of the country should be united in solid op position to auy other section. The disposition to refuse prompt and hearty obedience to equal rights aud the amendments to the constitution, is all that now stands in the way of com plete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is fla grantly and fraudulently violated or disregarded, it is safe to say that the people who placed them in the Consti tution as embodying the legitimate re sults of the war for the Union, and who believe them to be wise and nec essary, will continue to act together to insist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the enjoyment of the right by every American citizen who has the requis site qualifications, U fieely cast his vote and have it honestly counted. With this question rightly settled the country will be relieved of the con tentions of the past ; by-gones will in deed be by-gones, and political aud party issue? with respect to economy and efficiency of the administration, internal improvements, tariff, do mestic taxation, education, finance, and other important subjects, will then receive their full share of atten tion. But resistance to the nullifica tion of the result of the war will unite together it resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the author ity of the government and the preser vation of tlie union, and who adequate ly appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination proceeds from no hostile sentiment or feeling to any part of the people of our own country or to any of their interests. The invi olability of the Amendments rests upon the fundamental principles of our government. They are solely the expression of the will ol the people of Uie uuireu states. Tlie sentiment that the Constitutional rights of all our citizens must be maintained does not grow -veaker, and it will continue to control the government of the coun try. Happily the history of the late election shows that in many parts of the country where opposition to the Fifteen Amendment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing and is likely to cease altogether if firm aud well-3onsidered action is taken by Congress. I trust the house ol representatives and senate which have the right to judge of election returns aud qualifica tions of their own members will see to it that every case of violation of the letter or snirit of the Fifteenth Amend ment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit from such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will ue tlie duty of tlie .Executive, with sumeieui appropriations for the pur pose, to prosecute unsparingly all who nave ueen engaged in depriving citi zens of the rights guaranteed to them oy tue constitution. It is not. how ever to be forgotten that the best and surest guarantee of the primary rights oi ciii.cusuip is to ue found in tfiat capacity of self-protectiou which can belong only to a people whose ritrht to universal surrrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command of the local and State autnorities are in many cases wholly inadequate to fur nisli free instructions to all who ieed it. This is. especially true where. before emancipation, the education of tlie people was neglected or orevent- eti in ine interest or slavery, rirm'y Holding tlie conviction that the sub ject ol popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of the whole country with a view to wise aud comprehensive action of the Gov ernment of the United Slates, I res pectfully recommetid that Congress, by suitable legislation, and with proper safeguards, "supplement local educational efforts and funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been devolved on the uneducat ed people, by devoting to that pur pose grants of pub ic lands, and if neeessary, by appropriations from the treasury of the United States. What ever the government can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general educa tion is found, peace virtue and social order prevails, and civil and religious liberty are secured. In my former annual messages I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent neccessity of reformation of the civil service system of the gov ernment. My views concerning the danger of patrcurge or appointments for personal considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience in the execxtive office, and I believe these dangers threaten the stability of the government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They 'tend to become more alarming with the en largement of the administrative ser vice. As the growth of the country in population increases the number of officers and placemen employed, the reasons are Imperative for the adop tion of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promotions and re movals; establishing a uniform method bavins? exclusively in view in every instance the attainment of the best qualifications for the positions in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the most economical and efficient administration of public business. He then refers to the system, aud recom mends the appropriation of $25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a com mission to be appointed by the Presi dent in accordance with the terms of section 1753, Revised statute, whose duty it shall be to devise a lust, uni form and efficient system of competi tive examination, and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the govern ment. - Iniptffftc but True.
