Tin Standard Oil company's- brief In the proceeding- of the I'nlted States against that eoniiany on the chart;' of accepting rebates from the Chi 'ago & Alton railroad, in which the I'ni-l'-d Slates court for tile northern dis trict of Illinois Imposed a line of $-U.-240,000 was todav filed in the su preme court of the United Slates. The ease comes before the court on h petition by the government for a writ of certiorari bringing it up for review of the d'ecision of the United Stales circuit court of apm-als for the seventh circuit, by which court the district court's decision was reversed. The brief antagonizes this petition and this opposition is based principally on the ground that the law does riot "au thorize a review by the supreme court, on an application cf the government of a judgment of the circuit court of iipi-eais ni n i i .'i.n.uw (.-is - Ly v' hlv.li a writ of error of the defendant Is sus tained and disposed of by reversing the judgment ati-H sentence of the trial court " it is contended that, in a case id' this kind a vvri1 of certiorari is o,iiiva lent to a writ of error and that "th" policy of the law is against tin- review of a judgment In favor of the accused In a orirriinnl ease- at. the instaure of tin- (rovernmeut."

Ind., and Whiting or other suburban switch ing points in Indiana. From these points the government contends that tin- railroad was required to charge eighteen cents per hundred or three times the Chicago rate and that then- fore the Standard company which shipped from the .suburb of Whiting at the Chicago rate was prop, rly mulcted by the district court in the sum of $2fl. 000, Ano "for not shipping at and paying a prohibitive rate of three times as much as the Chicago rate." Contention is made that due effort was made on behalf of tin Standard company to discover tin legal rate and it is urged that the company should not he held respon sible for Its failure In that respect. Continuing the brief says: "Counsel argues the construction of the Elkins amendment as if congress, in passing It, rcgnrtb-d tin- shipment of commodities in Interstate as fraught with evil or danger to the stfety or morals of society, and that :' was therefore to he burdened with penal restrict tons, and that shippers are to ee held to a rule of diligence in knowing- that the rates at which th'-y ship ale the current lawful, tiled and pub lished rates, such us has been in ex treme cases applied to dritmsh, p keepers selling honors to minors or druggists selling poisons.

Mr. Ta ft asked that the lumber schedule be left undisturbed, saying that the free entry of lumber would not lend to conserve the American for ests, and that the consumers probably would get no benefit ill the way of re duced prices. He admitted that he would be sat Isfi'-d with the retention of the tariff on the low grades of lumber.
