A case of the above character is report ed to us as occurring within the precincts of South in gton, on Tuesday night of last week. The circumstances as far as we could learn are the following: A man named Samuel Eyster, of Boardman, Mahoning county, who is a husband and lather, visited the township of Southing ton, in the capacity of a canvasser for books. During his stay in that neigh borhood he stopped at the house of a Mr. Anthony, they being relatives of his wife. While here Eyster succeeded in winning the affections of a young lady, a daughter of Anthony, and proposed an elopement, which was acceeded to by the lady, the parties coming to Warren and putting up at the Austin House ; but her father missing her and Eyster, sup posed all was not right, and came to Warren, where he found hia daughter and entreated her to return with him, which abe promised to do; but a note from Eyster, who had sought refuge in another part of the town, informed her they would be taken to GarrettaTille by a privata conveyance which would be in waiting at a certain locality. Absent ing herself from her father, which be supposed would be but a moment, she sought the place mentioned in the note, and was taken to Garrettaville. Whith er the runaways have gone, we are not informed. The character of the young lady is said to hav been good. Theatrical.

In regard to the Improvements oi our utile village, l aia not nave wie ieai Idea that I wa writing an article to be cor rected or criticised. In said article I did not interfere In the least with any person or any otber place. I merely gave the reader a few facta. But the bird flutters when hit" and I Imagine I moat baw a truck a very tender chord iu poor Xenopbon a breaat by the way he flutters, as nothlnt- but Jealousy or preju dice would have caused him to write his Mtiaht corrections. After admitting all my statements to be veritable facta, he further aads, "unfortunately for said incorporation, they are not to be found within Its limits nor indeed in tue Biaie. out in an adjacent eoau tylin the State of Pennsylvania." Unfortu nately! Audi AlUram Partem. Now every one that has ever visited Orancevtlle knows that it I les in the two States, and the Interest of the whole town eoro prises Its entire loca-J lion, hartner, said improvements are loca ted about five feet from the State of Ohio, were all built and sre now owned by parties who are actual residents and real estate owners in the incorporated village of Orange ville, Ohio. And further, this town has nev er received ten dollars In the way of Improve ments from the actual residents in Pennsyl vania, except Mrs. Paden wbo has Just built a new residence. All the credit goes to the ac count of Orangeville, O. Now hia tiighteame (umwelghed in the scales af common sense amounts to nothing. Xenopbon would do well to crawl into his hole and pull in his quill siter mm, or come out point Diana ana say that he don't like Orangeville. for the reason that she it outgrowing all the little towns around her. I am authorized to say in this communication that my former fig nres were 115,000 to fctt.000 too low, and figures can be given to prove the assertion. If neces sary, but we don't propose to pat ourselves to too much trouble to satisfy the whims of our worthy correspondent. In regard to Govern ment Land I would say that we have gov ernment lands here worth from $75 to $400 per acre, and are governed by men who know their business and don't take nalns to attend to other neoDle's affairs. The man that came here for government lands got on the train tnree mile too soon, as ne sncuia have went to Hartford where he could have found land that the Government would be ashamed to own. Illustrious Aenophon. Greene. Editor Chboficxs : In your last week's Issue I noticed a statement from of M es- potamia. giving the amount of corn raised this season by a venerable old gentleman. who Der formed the entire amount of labor at the ripe ut of seventy-one years. Also In this week's issue Is a statement of the amount raised by 8. w. Irwin, and thinks that "Uncle Tim" will have to try again. Bat Farmer falls to mention one very im portant Item. He does not give the age of Mr. lrwin.or now mucn assistance ne naa in performing the labor. As oar worthy friend wishes "the old greyheaded larks of Tram bull" to state what they are doing. I will state a few items of labor performed by the writer of this article the past season. He Is sixty-three years of age.and partially a crip ple caused by a broken limb, and is necessi tated to labor in more or leas constant pain. In addition to milking six cows morning and evening, without a single failure, tend ing a garden which has yielded an abundant supply of various kinds of sauce; planting, hoeing and harvesting three acres of corn and one-half acre of potatoes and beans, with only one day's additional help, he has eat fifteen acre of grass of fair growth, doing all the work by hand. Has ground his own scythe, holding it on the stone with one hand and turning with the other. Has mowed, a oread, raked, cocked od. Ditched on and loaded, pitched off and mowed away the entire amount with but one-half day's as sistance. Though he Is com pai led to yield the palm to his venerable friend as to the amount of corn to the acre, he thinks perns pa be can compete with him as to the amount of labor performed during the season. In conclusion, hs would modestly enquire who. In old Trumbull, at bis see, has done better? D. R.
