HIERIDAX'S DEATH A NATIONAL AF- FLIC-TON. The death of Gen. Sheridan, in Au gust last, was a national affliction. The limy then lost the grandest of its chiefs. the country lost 'a brave and expe rienced soldier, a wise and discreet souuselor, and a modest and sensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range of his personal.asso ciation will ne,ver fail to pay deserved and willing homage to his greatness and the glory of his career, but they will cherish with more tender sensibil ity the loving memory of his simple, generous and considerate nature. GERONIMO AND HIS GANG. The .Apache Indians, whose removal from their reservation in Arizona,, fol lowed by the capture of those of their number who engaged in a bloody and murderous raid during a part of the years 1885 and 1886, are how held as prisoners of war at Mount Vernon bar racks in the state of Alabama. They numbered on the 31st day of October. the date of the last report. S3 men, 170 women, 70 boys and 50 girls, in all 388 persons. The commanding officer states that they are in good health and con tented, and that they are kept employed as fully as is possible under the circum stances. The children, as they arrive at a suitable age, are sent to the Indian schools at Carlisle and Hampton. Last summer some charitable and kind peo ple asked permission to send two teach ers to these Indians for the purpose of instructing the adults, as well as such children as should be found there. Such permission was readily granted, accom modations were provided for the teach ers, and some portions of the buildings at the barracks were made available lor school purposes. The good work contemplated has been commenced, and the teachers engaged arc paid by the ladies with whom the plan originated. £ MISTAKEN PHII.ANTIIKOI'Y. 7 ' I am not at all in sympathy with those benevolent but injudicious people who are constantly insisting that these In dians should be returned to the reserva tion. Their removal was an absolute necessity if the lives and property of citizens upon the frontier are to be at all regarded by the government. Their continual restraint at a distance from the scene of their repeated and cruel murders and outrages is still necessary. It is a mistaken philanthropy, every way injurious, which prompts tho de sire to see these savages returned to their old haunts. They are in their resent location as the result of the est judgment of those having official responsibility in the matter, and who are by no means lacking in kind con sideration for the Indians. A number. of these prisoners have forfeited their lives to outraged law and humanity. INDIANS CANNOT BE TRUSTED. Experience has proved that they are dangerous and cannot be trusted. This is true not only of those who on the warpath have heretofore been actually guilty of atrocious murder, but of their kindred and friends, who while they. remained upon their reservation fur nished aid and comfort to those absent with bloody intent. The prisoners should be treated kindly and kept in restraint far from the locality of their former reservation. They should be subjected to efforts calculated to lead to their improvement and to tbe softening of their savage and cruel instincts, but their return to their old home should*; be persistently re sisted. The secretary in his report gives a graphic history of these In dians, and recites with painful vivid ness their bloody deeds and the un happy failure of the government to manage them by peaceful means. it will be amazing if a perusal of this his tory will allow the survival of a desire the return of these prisoners to their reservation upon sentimental or other grounds. THE NAVY AND ITS NEEDS. Secretary "Whitney Has Invari- ably Been on Deck and Performed His Duty Well. The report of the secretary of the navy demonstrates very intelligent management in that important depart ment, and discloses the most satis factory progress in the work of recon structing the navy made during the past year. Of the ships in course of construction, five, viz.: The Charles ton, Baltimore, Yorktown, Vesuvius and the Petrel, have in that time been launched and are rapidly approaching completion, ' and in addition to the above, the Philadelphia, the San Fran cisco, the Newark, the Bennington, the Concord ami the Herreshoff torpedo boat are all under contract for delivery to the department during the next year. The progress already made and being made gives food ground for the ex pectation that these eleven vessels will be incorporated as part of the American navy within the next twelve months. The report shows that notwithstanding the large expenditures- for new con struction and the additional labor they involve the total ordinary or current expenditure of the department for the three years ending June 30, ISSS, are less by more than '20 per cent than such expenditures for the three years ending June 30, ISB4. The various steps which have been taken to improve the busi ness methods of the business depart ment are reviewed by the secretary. The purchasing of supplies has been consolidated and placed under a respon- siole bureau head. This has resulted in the curtailment of open purchases which in the years 1884 and 1885 amounted to over 60 per cent of all the purchases of tne department, to less than 11 per cent, so that at the present time about 90 per cent of the total de partment purchases are made by con- tract and after competition, as the ex- ! penditures on the account exceed an average of $2,000,000 annually, it is evident that an important improvement in. the system has been inaugurated and substantial economies introduced. DON M.'S 

DEPARTMENT, There Is a Marked Increase of Business in the Postal Branch of the Government. The report of the postmaster, general shows a marked increase of business in every branch of the postal service. The number of postoffices July 1, 1888, was 57,376, an increase of 6,124 in three years and of 2,219 for the last fiscal year. The latter-mentioned increase is classified as follows: New* England states 5, Middle states 181, Southern states and Indian territory (41) 1,400. the states and territories of the Pacific coast 100, the ten states and territories of the West and Northwest 435, District of Columbia:.', total 2,219. Free delivery offices have increased from 180 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887, to 358 in the year ended June 30, 1888. In the railway mail service there has been an increase in one year of 168 routes and in the number of miles traveled per annum an increase of 150, - the estimated increase of rail- road service for the year was 6,000 miles, but the amount of new railroad service actually put on was 12,764.50 miles. The volume of business in the money order division, including transactions in postal notes, reached the sum of up- wards of 13,000,000 for the year. Dur- ing the past year parcel post conven tions have been concluded with Bar- badoes, the Bahamas, British Honduras and Mexico, and are now under nego tiation with all the Central and South American states. The increase of cor- respondence with foreign countries dur- ing the past two years is gratifying, and is especially notable and excep tional with the Central and South Amer ican stotes and with Mexico. -As the greater part of mail matter exchanged with these countries is commercial in its character, this increase is evidence of the improved business relations with them. The practical operation of the parcel post conventions, so far as nego tiated, has served to fulfill the most fa- vorable predictions as to their benefits. In January last a general postal con yon tion was inaugurated with the Dominion of Canada, which went into operation March 1, and which practically makes one postal territory of the United States and Canada, and under it mer chandise and parcels may now be trans mitted through the " mails 7' at fourth class rates of postage, it is 7 uot possi ble here to touch evrcu the leading heads of the great- postal; establishment, to illustrate the enormous r: and rapid growth of business, and of the needs for legislative readjustment : '"of much of its machinery that it . has ■ outgrown. For these j and valuable : recommenda tions of the postmaster general atten tion is called to his report. A depart ment whose revenues have increased from $19,772,000 in 1870 to $52,700,000 in 1888, despite reductions of postage which have enormously . reduced rates of revenue while greatly increasing its business, demands the careful consider ation of congress as to all matters sug gested by those familiar with its opera tions, and which are calculated to in crease its efficiency and usefulness. 77 THE POSTHASTE!! GENERAL'S PRO- POSAI.S. A bill proposed by the postmaster gen eral was introduced at the last, session of the congress, by which a uniform standard in the amountof gross receipts would fix the rights of a community to a public building to be erected by the government for postoffice purposes. It was demonstrated that aside from the public convenience and the promotion of harmony among citizens, invariably disturbed by change of leasings and of site, it was "a measure of the. highest economy and of sound business judg ment. "It was found that . the govern ment was paving in rents at the rate of from 7 to 10 per cent per annum on what the cost of such public buildings would be. A very great advantage re suiting from such- a law would be the prevention of ■: a large number of bills constantly introduced for the erection of', public buildings at places and involving expenditures not justified: by public honesty. 1 trust that this measure will become a law at the present session ot congress. Of the total number of the postmasters 54,874 are of the fourth class. These, of course, receive no allowances what ever for expenses [in the service, and their compensation is fixed by percent age on receipts of their respective of- fices. This rate of compensation may have beeu, and. : probably was, at some time, just. But the standard has re- mained unchanged through the several reductions in the rates of postage. Such reductions have necessarillv. cut down the compensation of these officials, while it undoubtedly increased the busi- ness performed by them. Simple jus tice required attention.' to this subject, to the end that fourth-class postmasters may receive at least an equivalent to that which the law itself fixing the rate intended for them. 

CLERKS' AND CARRIERS' NEEDS. Another class of postal employes whose condition seems to demand legis lation is that of clerks in postoffices, and I call especial attention to the re- port recommendations of the postmaster general for their classification. Proper legislation of this character for the re- lief of carriers in the free delivery serv- ice has .been frequent. Provision is made for their promotion; for substi tutes for them on vacation; for substi tutes for holidays, and limiting their hours of labor. Seven mil. ion dollars has been appropriated for the current year to provide for them, though . the total number of offices where they are ■employed is but 358 for the past fiscal year, with an estimated increase for the current year of but 40; while tlie total appropriation for all cierks in offices throughout the United States is $5,950, --000. The legislation affecting the rela tions of the government with railroads is in need of revision. .-While for the most part the -.railroad 7 companies throughout the country have cordially co-operated with the postoffice : depart- ment iv rendering excellent service, yet under the law as it stands, while the compensation to them, for carrying the mail is limited aud regulated, and although railroads are made post roads Iby law, there is no authority reposed anywhere to compel the owner of a railroad to take and carry the United States mails. ..-,. 7; ■ ILL-FITTING LEGISLATION. The only alternative provided by the act of congress, in case of refusal, is for the postmaster general to send the mail forward by pony or express. This is but an illustration of ill-fitting legisla tion, reasonable and proper at the time of its enactment, but long since out- grown and requiring readjustment. EXPENSES HAVE BEEN CUT DOWN. It is gratifying to note from the care fully prepared statistics accompanying the postmaster general's report that notwithstanding the great expansion of the service the rate of expenditure has been lessened and efficiency has been improved in every branch; that fraud and crime have decreased; that losses from the mails have been reduced, and that the number of complaints of the service made to postmasters and to the department are far less than ever be- fore. . - ' y . ! THE ARKANSAS TRAVELER. \ Attorney General Garland's Re- port Contains a Number of Im portant Recommendations. . The transactions of the department of justice for the fiscal year ended Juno 30, 1888, are contained in 'the report ot the attorney general, as well as. a number of valuable recommendations, the most of which are repetitions of those previously made, and ought to receive consider ation. It is stated in this report that, though judgments in civil suits amount- ing to $552,021.08 were recovered in favor : of the government during tho year, only the sum of $182,934 was' collected thereon, and that though fines, penal- ties and forfeitures were imposed. amounting to $541,805.43, only 9109,648. of that sum was paid on account thereof. These tacts may furnish an illustration of the sentiment which extensively pre- vails, that a debt due the government should cause no inconvenience to the citizen. '-': ''■ 7:7''v-: 7* MATTERS IN MORMONDOMV It also appears from this report that, though prior to March, 1885, there 'had been but six convictions in the terri tories of Utah and Idaho under the laws of 1862 and 1882, punishing polyg amy and unlawful cohabitation as a crime, there have been since that date nearly 600 convictions under these laws and the statutes of 1887, and the opinion is expressed that under Such a firm and vigilant execution of these laws and the advance of ideas opposed' to the for- bidden practices of polygamy within the United States is virtually at an end. Suits instituted by the government under the provisions of the act of March 3, ISS7, for the termination of the corporations known as the Perpet ual Emigrating Fond company and the- Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints have resulted, in a degree, favor- able to the government declaring the charters of these corporations forfeited and escheating their property. Such property, amounting in value to more than £800,000, is in the hands of a re- ceiver," pending further proceedings, an appeal having been taken to the su preme court of the United States. DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. Their Condition 7 Fully Exhibited in Secretary Vilas' Report. In the report of the secretary of the In the report of * the secretary of the interior, which will be laid. before you, the condition of the various branches of our domestic affairs connected with that department and its operations during the past year are fully exhibited. 7 But a brief reference to some of the subjects discussed in this able and interesting] report can here be made, but I com-' mend the entire report to the attention of the congress, and trust that the sensi ble and valuable recommendations it contains will secure careful considera tion. 1 cannot too strenuously insist upon the importance of proper measures to in- sure right disposition of our public lands, not only as a matter of present justice, but in forecast of the consequences to future generations. ' The broad, rich acres of our agricultural plains have been long preserved by nature* to be- come her untrammeled gifts to a people, civilized and free, upon which should. THE

LANDS BELONG TO TIIE PEOPLE. • 7 7 Our dear experience ought sufficiently • to urge the speedy enactment of meas ures of legislation which will confine the future disposition of our remaining agricultural lands to the uses of actual husbandry and genuine homes. 7 Nor should our vast tracts of so-called desert lands be yielded up to the monopoly of corporations or grasping individuals, as appears to be much the tendency under the existing statute. These lands re- quire but the supply of water to become fertile and productive. It is a problem of great moment, how most wisely; for the public good, that factor shall be furnished, I cannot but think it peril- ous to suffer either these lands or the sources of their irrigation to fall into the hands of monopolies, which, by such means, may exercise lordship over areas dependent on their treatment: for productiveness. Already steps have. been taken to secure accurate and sci entific information of the conditions, which is the prime basis of intelligent action. Until this shall be gained, the course of wisdom appears clearly to be in a suspension of further disposal which only promises to create rights an- tagonistic, to the common interest. No harm can follow this precautionary con- duct. The land will remain and the public good presents no demand for hasty dispossession of national owner ship and control. STATE GRANTS SHOULD. BE SETTLED. 1 commend, also, the recommenda tions • that appropriate measures be taken to complete the J; adjustment:; of. the various grants made to the states for internal improvements; and" of swamp and overflowed lands, as well as to adjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous private land claims. All these are ele ments of great injustice and peril to the settlers upon the localities affected, and now that their existence is more pressing, to fix, as soon as possible, their bounds, and terminate the threats! of trouble, which arise from uncer tainty. 7y;;7.7-y7vyr Lu'S CONDITION IS IMPROVING. ; The condition of our Indian popula tion continues to improve and the proofs multiply that the transforming change so much to be desired which shall sub- stitute for barbarism enlightenment and civilizing education is in favorable pro- cess. Our relations with these people: during the year have been disturbed by no serious disorder, but rather marked by a better realization of their true in- terests and increasing confidence and, goodwill. These conditions testify to' the value of higher tone of considera tion and humanity which has governed the later methods of dealing with them, and commend its continued observance.' Allotments in severalty have been made on some reservations until all those en- titled to " land thereon have had their shares assigned and the work is still continued. In directing the execution of this duty; 1 have not aimed so much. at rapid despatch as to secure just and fair arrangements which shall best con- duce to the objects of the law, by pro- ducing satisfaction with the results of the allotments made.No measure of gen- eral effect has ever been entered on from which more may be fairly hoped, if it shall be discreetly adminis tered. It proffers opportunity and inducement to that independence of spirit and life which the Indians' pecularities need, while at the same time the inalienable right of title affords se curity against the risks his inexperience expose him to in dealing with others. Whenever begun upon any reservation it should be made complete, so that all are brought to the same condition, and as soon as possible. . Community in lands should cease by opening such as remain unallotted to settlement. Con- tact with the ways of industrious and successful farmers will perhaps add a healthy emulation, which will both in- struct and stimulate. REDS NEED EDUCATING. 7- .. -.-; ,*-: But no agency for the amelioration of this people appears to me so promising as the extension, urged by the secretary, of such complete facilities of education as shall at the earliest possible day em- brace all teachable Indian youths, of both sexes, and retain them with a kindly and beneficent hold until their characters are formed, and their faculties . and dispositions trained to . the sure pursuit of Some form of useful industry; capac ity of the Indian no longer needs dem onstration. It is established: it re- mains to make the most of it, and when it shall be done the curse will be lifted, the Indian race saved, and the sin of their oppression redeemed. The time of its accomplishment depends ..upon the spirit and justice with which it shall be prosecuted.. It cannot be-too soon for the Indian, nor for the inter- ests and good name of the nation. The average attendance of Indian pupils in the schools increased by over '.WO dur- ing the year, and the total enrollment reached 15,212. The cost of mainte- nance was not materially raised. The number of teachable Indian youth is now estimated at 40,005, or nearly three times the enrollment of the schools. It is believed the obstacles in the way of instructing all are surmountable, ; and that the necessary expenditure would be a measure of economy Ay^Apj STUBBORN SIOUX. - -.yy. .'■-' The Sioux tribes on the great reserva tion of Dakota refused to assent to the act passed by the congress at its last. session for opening a portion of their lands to white settlement, notwith- standing modification of the terms was suggested which met most of their ob- jections. Their demand is for imme diate payment of the full price of $1.25 per acre for the entire body of land the occupancy of which they are asked to relinquish. The manner of submis sion insured their fair understanding of the law, and their action was undoubt edly as thoroughly intelligent as their capacity admitted. It is . at least grati- • fying that no reproach of overreaching can in any manner lie against the gov ernment, however advisable the favor- able completion of the negotiation may have been esteemed. 1 concur in the j suggestions of the secretary regarding the Turtle Mountain Indians, the two reservations in California and the Crees. They should, in my opinion, re- ceive immediate attention. THE NATION'S WARDS. It Is Due to Them and the Govern- : ment That the Pension Laws Be Revised. v - _'_"'- \ . The number of pensioners added to the rolls during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888. is 00,252, and: increase of pen- sions was granted in 45,716 cases. The names of 15,730 pensioners were dropped . from the "rolls during : the year.- for, various causes; and at the close of the year the number of persons of all classes receiving pensions was: 452,557. Of these there were 806 survivors ot , the war of 1812, 10,787 widows of those who' served in that war, 16.060 soldiers of the: Mexican war and 5,104 widows of said soldiers. One hundred and. two differ- ent rates of pensions are paid -i to these i beneficiaries, ranging from %i to $416.66 per month. The amount paid for: pen sions during the fiscal year .wasl $78,- ; 775,861.92, being an increase over. the i preceding - year of $5,308,280.22. .The 7: expenses y attending the : main-. tenance and operation of the pension bureau during that period were $3,262, --574.67, making the entire expenditures of the; bureau $82,038,386.57, being 21K per cent of the total expenditures of the, government during the year^TH^-'^v;' y1 am thoroughly convinced that ■ our general pension laws should be revised and adjusted, to meet as far as | possible in the light of our experience, all meri-, torious cases. The fact that 102 different; rates of pensions are paid cannot in my opinion be made consistent with justicell to the pensioner, or to the government;^; and the numerous private pension I bills i that are passed, predicated upon the im- 1 perfection of general laws, while they* increase in many cases existing inequal ity and injustice, [ additional force. to the recommendation for a revision of, the general laws on this subject.; .7 i: 7 UNJUST to-all concerned. ';.( The laxity of ideas prevailing "among; a large number of our people regarding pensions is becoming every day '.morel marked. The principles ; upon ; which they should be granted are in danger of. being altogether ignored, aud already pensions are often claimed because the applicants are as much entitled as other successful applicants, rather than upon any disability reasonably attributable to military service. If the establishment of various precedents be continued,if the granting of pensions be not divorced from partisan and other unworthy and irrelevant considerations, and if the hou-.. orable:uame ot veteran unfairly be comes-by these means but another term for one who constantly clamors for the aid of the government, there is danger that injury will be done to the fame and patriotism of many ;; whom our citizens all delight to honor, and : that a preju dice will be aroused unjust to meritori ous applicants for pensions. I AGRICULTURAL! AFFAIRS. Uncle Sam Aims to Benefit the , Noble Yeomanry. ; The . department of agriculture has continued, with a good measure of suc cess, its efforts .to develop the proc esses, enlarge the results and augment the profits of American husbandry. It has collected and distributed practical information, Introduced and tested new plants, cheeked the 7 spread of conta gious disease of farm animals, resisted the advance of noxious .insects and de structive fungus growth, and sought to secure to agricultural labor the highest reward of effort, and the fullest immu nity from loss, Its record of the year shows that the season of 1888 has been one of medium production. A generous supply of the "demand's of consumption has been assured.- and a surplus for ex portation, moderate is certain products and bountiful' in others, will prove a benefaction alike to buyer and grower. Four years ago it was 'found that the great cattle industry ' of the country was endangered, and those engaged in it were alarmed at the rapid extension' of the European lung plague of .pleuro-pheumouia. Se rious outbreaks existed in Illinois, Mis souri and Kentucky, and in Tennessee animals afflicted were held in quaran tine. Five counties in New York, and from one to four counties in each of the states of New ' Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and* Maryland were almost equally affected. With this great dan-' ger upon us, and with the contagion al ready in the' channels of commerce, with the enormous direct and indirect; losses already being caused by.it. and when only prompt and energetic action could be successful, there were in none of these states any laws authorizing this - department to eradicate the malady, ore giving tne. state officials y power to co-_ operate with it. for . this purpose. The. department even lacked both the requi-7 site appropriation and authority. * 9 By securing state co-operation in con nection with authority from congress,l; the work of eradication has beenl pressed successfully, and this dreaded*' disease lias bern extirpated from the Western states, and also from the East ern states, with the exception of a few restricted area's, which are \ still \ under"B" supervision. The danger has thus been; removed; and trade and commerce" have been freed from ; the"' vexatious state restrictions which were deemed necessary for a time. . . '■;: 7 . '/■'•' SUGAR FROM SORGHUM. I During the past four years the proc ess of diffusion, as applied to the manu facture of sugar from sorghum and sugar cane, has been introduced into this country and fully perfected by the experiments carried on by the depart ment of agriculture. This process is now universally considered to be the best economical oue, and it is through it that the sorghum sugar industry has been established upon a firm basis and the road to its future success opened. The adoption of this diffusion process is also extending in Louisiana and other sugar-producing parts of the country, and will doubtless soon be the only method employed for the extraction of sugar from the cane. An exhaustive study has also within the same period been undertaken of the subject of food adulteration and the best analytical methods for detecting it. A part of the results of this work has al ready been published by the depart ment, whicli, with" the matter iv course of preparation, will make the most com plete treatise on that subject that has ever been published in aim country. The department seeks a progressive de-" velopment. It would combine the dis coveries of science with the economies and amelioration of rural practice. A su pervision of the endowed experimental station system/recently provided for. is a proper function of the department, and is now in operation. This super vision is very important, and should be ; wisely and vigilantly directed to the end' that the pecuniary aid of the govern- ! ment in favor of intelligent agriculture should be so applied as to result in the general good and to the benefit of all ; our people, thus, justifying the appro priation made from the public- treasury. .PACIFIC RAILROADS. - j ■ The adjustment of the relations be-.; tween the government and the railroad companies which have received land grants and the guaranty of the public credit in aid of the construction of . the railroads, should, receive early atten tion. ■' '■■•• 777! .

PRESS COMMENT. The President's Message as Viewed by the Holders of Public 7 Opii-fbn. .--,".," '; Baltimore, Md., Dec. 3.— The' Sun to-morrow will say:* Mr. Cleveland writes with the authority and power of a man whose convictions are thorough and whose information is full, and' with that air of confidence which springs from the consciousness that the truth, like all other great forces, continues to move on and grow, notwithstanding the efforts of heretic politicians to destroy it. Altogether the message is" exceed ingly full and well written. It is a fit-" ting supplement to the able state pa pers President Cleveland has given the country, and of no public servant, in this generation at least,- can it be more truly said than of himself, that he has constantly guarded the rectitude of his intention, maintained unsullied his love of country, and with unselfish.pur pose striven for the public good. 7 ; The American will say: "The mes sage lacks the vigor, spirit and ihdivrt uality heretofore conspicuous, in his official . writings, and conveys, the im pression that the president has suddenly tired of his duties and has relaxed his grip upon the helm of the ship of state. He nowhere rises above the common place, except in his introduction, which is" a labored pessimistic wail over his defeat in : November, and a despairing appeal to his scattered partisans ;to rally under the old* flag of free trade and save the country from imaginary perils not": suggested by any existing condition." 7 77; ..';: - Washington, Dec. 3.— The Post to morrow will say: "The president dis cusses the tariff with all the earnest ness that characterizes his late .specific: message on that subject; and in which, ml spite of all reverses, be still main tains, is the great issue before : the country. To be consistent with him self it was necessary.that even in the fate of an adverse public verdict he should adhere to a cause which ; he ; de liberately and defiantly made the su preme test of his j administration/; But the situation, bad as it is, is not wholly due to the tariff. There are other and graver ills to be confronted £ and J over come. So far as the tariff isl concerned we have full faith that its inequalities; and enactions, are now universally; conceded will soon be: adjusted upon a satisfactory 7 basis. The sooner • the question is taken out of 7 partisan poli tics the better. The silence of the mes sage with regard to civil service reform is its notable and peculiar feature. It is not to be ! assumed " that the president has lost faith in the reform, but is it not a fair presumption that he has lost faith in the reformers? ' Or. perhaps more natural construction to be placed upon his apparent abandonment of : the cause is that having brought the civil service to its present high . position, he prefers '■ not to argue the question of its continu ance with the, incoming administration. His own responsibility in this matter is well nigh at an end: * •"•;' ■':■'-"• :•$- ; - ->-: fi Chicago, Dec. 3.— The llerald (Dem.) to-morrow, in commenting on the presi dent's message, will ' say : .*■ "There ; is not a c- passage -in .this important j and : significant • state ■<• paper,' but ? im presses ; tne country with a ; sense: that Grover Cleveland, as president, was '. the •■ right man in. the right place.'' ' t The Times * (Dem.) will ; say: "Many ; millions •of * citizens *, reading this last state 7 paper l of • Cleveland's will 7 find ; themselves : deeply . regretting the - fail ure to re-elect him to the presidency.". ; ; The News (Ind; Rep.) will say : "None but a hidebound partisan. can fail to be [ aroused to admiration of the. man ; who in the hour of political' defeat can still keep , his ; 7 rudder > true * and -:, abso lutely - suppress .-* all ..personal y feeling in his last official utterance.

The president, the Tribune will say, "is bold, nervy, and: desires •- at least one more round before he will acknowledge him self whipped." y 7. ;:,. y. ■;>;... ; The Inter Ocean will say the message contrasts sharply with the policy adopted a year ago, when the president could think of : nothing but 7 the tariff. On that question the Inter Ocean com ments: "That part of his message might have been written .by Manton Marble, Joseph Mectill, Henry Watterson, or any other free trader, accustomed to think pen in hand. In , fact, the New York World, Louisville Courier-Journal and Chicago Tribune have said substantially the \ same thing that one finds in this message over and over again. - And they were stale before they said them the first time." . 

HARRISON'S ORGAN. Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 3.— The Journal will say editorially of the presi- dent's message : "It is very Clevelandish in style and temper. Its individuality and- exhibitions of Mr. Cleveland's per sonality mar what would g otherwise be a fairly good business message. Mr. Cleveland seems to construe , the con: stitutional requirement as a license to scola ..: ■ the country for rejecting, his free trade policy and lecture the people for their lack of intelligence and capac ity for. self-government.* This is very: characteristic of Mr. Cleveland. He is a chronic scold and lecturer. The gen- eral tone of most -of his utterances is; that of- a man who has devoted the best years of his life in trying to save the American people from self-destruction and whose efforts have been crowned with poor success. His pessimistic style bespeaks great anxiety for the fate, of the country when he shall let go of it. We do not believe his anxiety, is shared by the people to any extent.** The solemn and ponderous way in which the president begins by re- ferring to the dangers that threaten the government at the begin- ning of its second hundred years of national existence, and then lapses into chronic platitudes about the tariff and surplus, seems like a great reach after something statesmanlike. It only attains to a mischievous demagogy, for that is the size of his talk about the growth of classes,- the gulf between employers and employes, the exactions of . capital, the - wrongs of labor, etc. In all- this jeremial , about the decadence of patriotism and morals there is not a sound principle . nor healthy idea. No president has ever before so roundly lectured the American people for our alleged neglect of duty, or so plainly appealed to class interests and prejudices in support of a pet pol- icy. The business parts ot the message are better. It is doubtful, however, if the - present congress, in the short time at its disposal, can give any of them proper attention, and the next one will take its suggestions from another source. The argument against using the surplus for the purchase and retire ment of government bonds is ridiculous. It might be good against creating a sur- plus, but as against the disposition of an existing surplus it is absurd. It is a condition that confronts " us, not a theory;"- 7/ ;...." ;/_:' . 

ENGLISH OPINION. London, Dec. The London Morn ing Post." commenting on the president's message, says: "If America is really in clined to resume negotiations on the subject of the fisheries, she will find the English ministers animated only by a sincere desire to promote a ' final and satisfactory adjust ment which Mr. Cleveland" mentions, while unable to hold the same opinion as Mr. Cleveland as to what the great demands of comity are." The Post thinks that it would be belter if England would look to the disposition of American statesmen in the future than to wrangle over the past. The Daily News says it would express more regret for Mr. Cleveland's acri monious reference to the dismissal of Lord Sackville if- Lord Salisbury had not set the example. Mr. Cleveland, it thinks, evidently has Lord Salisbury's fatal gift of a bitter tongue. "In other respects the message seems to be .the most powerful per formance which the president has accomplished, namely, the feat of saying something both new and true about protection. The News further remarks that the message is likely to become a household word for the ora tors of Hyde Park and Clerkenwell. The fisheries question, it thinks, will have a smaller chance for settlement under Mr. Harrison than under Mr. Cleveland, but having only one great party to please, the chances for a judg ment on its merits may be greatly im proved. - . The Chronicle says: "President Cleve land uses strong, but true, language about protection. In regard to the Sackville -matter, it is . satisfying to find that he refers to it as an occurrence to be deeply regretted. This is in marked contrast to Lord Salisbury's flippant sarcasm. We hope that Lord Salisbury will con sider it a sufficient reason to appoint a successor to Lord Sackville without de lay."- " ;u*. '. The Standard says: "President Cleve land's message might have been more gracious . and dignified if he could only have effaced from his recol lection '■■ the unsuccessful election "coup" which sullied another honorable record. •We did not expect to find him repeating his original error to show that he was not ashamed of him self." After auotiug references to the Sackville matter in the message," the Standard proceeds in a similar strain and runs through sentence after sentence of solemn froth. "Englishmen," it. says, "I can afford to smile at such puerile nonsense, and even Americans will not pretend to take it is good earnest. Doubt less y Lord Sackville was technically wrong, but "ministers Lowell and Phelps committed themselves in the same way, though not in the same degree, scores of times in their addresses to En glishmen which we read with much edification and not the smallest trace of resentment." The Standard thinks the fisheries question now has a chance of being settled. - • The Charms of Roast Monkey.

The college girls were in their second inning. They wore a uniform of dark jersey blouse and short gown; with white '■ girdle and visored cap. and the captainess had sent in two tall twin blondes, whose yellow curls blew about their eyes, but whose light steps and splendid muscular- development told no tales of midnight oil or debilitating effects of . the higher education. They were wonderfully graceful in their movements and grace— pardon an awk ward truth— the rarest of all character istics in a woman out of doors.

A Claim That Christopher Was Not the Discoverer of America, Chicago Tribune. The Chicago men who are figuring on bringing the "Colnmbus celebration in 1892 to this city have cause to bestir them selves. ; Not only may Chicago lose the big fair, but the big fair may not be held.. At least so says Miss Marie A. Brown. . . OVi -y. 7^7-7-7y-7y "It is perfectly absurd," said Miss Brown, "to talk about Columbus discov ering America. You might as : well speak of a New Yorker discovering Chi cago years after the Chicago fire.''" ' ."How so?" . '-■■■' 7*;;j . "Iv the first place the Scandinavians had been in this country hundreds of years before Columbus was born. They went from Norway and Sweden to Ice land, from there to Greenland, and then to the North American continent. They went south almost as far as Boston." "Where did they go then?" asked a defender of the Columbus idea. "They staid there and colonized the place. . Why, I can prove to you or any one else, if I am allowed to continue my researches, that after Lief Erickson dis covered the American continent in the year 1000 there were thirty Roman Cath olic bishops appointed by Rome, and they built a great many cathedrals and monasteries, and the bishops and monks sent. communications to Rome during the hundreds of years which elapsed be tween the year 1000 and the date of Christopher Columbus' landing." "How do you propose to continue your researches?" "I am getting up a petition for presen tation to congress, stating the facts of the case, asking that the index of all documents of American concern be tween the years 1763 and 178." be ex tended .as far . back as the year 1000. This will give a chance to establish the fact the existence of the colonies in Vinland and Greenland up to the date of their extinction in the year 1540. Besides this,.! propose to ask congress to au thorize a thorough investigation of the records of the Vatican which Pope Leo XIII. has thrown open for . public in spection. I expect to prove by those records that not only was there Euro pean travel between America and the old world long before the days of Col umbus, but that the colonists had ar rived at a high degree of civilization and were not the savage barbarians history, has designated them." "But how will this affect Columbus as a discoverer?" "Simply by proving that not only was there no originality in his discovery,but that he merely palmed off as his own what he learned from people." "From the Norwegians?" "Certainly. " In the year 1487, accord ing to the 'Life of Columbus.' written by his son, he undoubtedly visited Ice land, Greenland," and most probably the American continent. . He speaks of the tradewhich existed in those days be tween the Greenlauders and the English. and mentions the port of Bristol as the seat of trade in the Eastern hem is phere. He also' refutes the theory which existed at that time that the sea above a certain latitude was frozen. Five years alter that he made the jour ney from Spain which ended in South America, but it was not a discovery. He merely proved that the knowledge he had previously acquired was authen tic." . "Yon have evidently given the subject considerable study. Miss Brown?" "Yes, 1 have devoted six years to looking up authorities on the question. Three years I spent in Sweden, and two years in London, principally at the British' musem, which, next to the Vatican, is the : greatest mine on earth for discovering lost records. If con gress will devote an appropriation for the purpose :of sending me to inspect the Vatican records, I expect to prove conclusively before the year 1802 that the Columbus idea is an exploded myth, and that Lief Erickson, the Scandina vian, was the true discoverer of America." * .
