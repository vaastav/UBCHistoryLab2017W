22 +? SHIP PI PORT AUTHORITY FOR HUDSON BRIDGE Favors One Privately Owned as Part of Highway Development. MONUMENT TO INVENTOH \t??j t? n : * ? 1 i v mri nci'u 19 \ apiuii ami Revenue Enough to Make Plan Possible. The Port of New York Authority fttvors a Hudson River bridge, privately owned, as part of a system of highway development, but not in connection with Its plan for the solution of the railroad freight problem, according to a statement by Chairman fiugenius H. Outerbridge sent yesterday to the organizations cooperating with the Port Authority. Referring to the plans prepared by the Hudson River Bridge and Terminal Association, Inc., for a bridge to cross the Hudson in the neighborhood of Fiftyseventh street. Mr. Outerbridgc said, "No bridge structure has ever been designed before of such magnificent proportions as the proposed Hudson River Bridge. Its accomplishment would be a monument to the genius of Mr. Lindcntlial, the celebrated bridge engineer, its designer, and would furnish a convenience to the public for which there seems a popular appeal." Grave objections were found, however, to the inclusion of such a project in the authority's comprehensive plan for bi-State development of the port. These objections Include: 1. The building of the bridge will depend upon the provision of capital and the procurement of revenue to make it possible, which must come from sources beyond the scope of and indeterminable at this time by the Port Authority. To have adopted it as part of the hl-State plan and as a connecting link between New Jersey and Manhattan fcr a;l of the Jatter's freight service, would have been, in effect, to count upon and recommend a right of way on a structure designed to be a private enterprise and that right of way being dependent upon the enterprise being carried to fruition. 2. The time estimated for tna construction of the bridge was state.1 .(, be five years of working days, or the cjuiv alent of about seven years, making due allowance for seasonal and other interruptions to the work. 3. The freight terminal facilities suggested for Manhattan established them on elevated grades. The commission, as stated In the preliminary report of the chairman, unanimously determined they should be under ground. 4. Any extension of these facilities in the future to the lower East Side of Manhattan would necessitate an elevated railroad through Battery Park a id up the East Side, and the commission believes public opinion would be irrevocably against such a structure, and that it is improbable that such an extension could support the expense of similar terminal buildings on the Kast Side to enclose and conceal an elevated structure. Public opinion seems to have expressed itself definitely against further elevated structures on Manhattan. The Mayor has recently expressed the opinion of the city authorities that existing elevated rapid transit structures should be removed. 5. The only other possible extension to the eastward would be by tunnel tm?i>T and across Fifty-seventh street, which would establish a different level if connecting service to the easterly side of Manhattan was ultimately required. fi. Unless the terminal buildings on the west side of Manhattan were built for the entire distance, as planned, the two levels of elevated tracks would not he concealed and the railroads could not he served with adequate platform and storage space. 7 The enrnniete destruction of all ex tstlng Improvements on the continuous line of property from Forty-second street to Cortlandt etreet necessitated by the railroad and terminal buildings, as projected In this plan, would Involve the destruction of very large amounts of Invested capital, which the Port AuthorInvested capital, which the port authority would desire to avoid, and whether required condemnation or negotiation, would unquestionably Involve costs which cannot be predicated merely upon assessed values or upon any definite determination at this time. 8. When In the progress of time any <omiplete and radical change is made In the present methods of serving Manhattan present appliances and facilities will have become supplanted and have dlseppeared. Therefore, to hasard New York's sole dependence in the future for the necessaries of life upon a bridge which, either by an act of war or by a miscreant, might be totally destroyed by the placing or the dropping of a bomh. seemed, a point that must not be lightly disregarded. 0. Such a concentration of traffic at one point as the bridge would Involve has very obvious disadvantages to offset the advantages that were urged for it. Turning to the subject of highway communication between the States, the statement continues: A policy has already been adopted by them for the construction of vehicular tunnels: construction work upon two tunnels has already begun. It seems to be generally believed that by the time they are completed their capacity Is Hkely to he at once absorneq. it I* stated by the projector* of the Hudson Ttiver RrldRe that Its capacity for vehlctilar traftlc would equal that of many tunnel* and that It* coat would be much le*? than a sufficient number of tunnel? to equal IU capacity. Those question* ouRht to be possible of determination by the proper authorities and If found to be correct, the State* might change their future policy and undertake the. bulldlny of a brldRo a* a public en'erprlse. The State* of New Jersey and Pennsylvania have recently irlven an example of this In the Joint bulldlnR of the Delaware Ttiver Prldse between Philadelphia and Camden. Should New York and New Jersey dc likewise a* to a Hudson River BrldRc. the objection to dependlnR upon a rlRht of way over a privately owned hltrhwav for a public port plan mlRht disappear. A Hudson River brldRe will appear on the hlRhway map prepared by the authority, Mr. OuterbrldRe stAted.

TO ENFORCE JONES ACT Section Providing for Abrogation of Treaties Likely to Re Approved. The sub-committee on merchant marine policy of the American Steamship Owners Association is expected to have j ready next week its recommendations J for legislation necessary to the support I and development of American shipping. | It has not yet been decided whether j these proposals will be published in ad| vance of President Harding's soecial | message on shipping questions, which he j is said to be prepared to deliver early in January. The sdb-eommittee's report will ne I based upon replies to a questionnaire sent i to all the members of the association. ] Although nothing official has been given out regarding the attitude of the members it is known that practical unanimity was shown on most of the e ssential points in shipping policy. It already is reasonably certain what form the recommendations will take. A direct subsidy will be favored as ) the only sure means of enabling AnieriI can ships to meet foreign competition where lower costs of operation and capi ital charges are encountered. Proper J safeguards will be advocated, however, to prevent abuse of the Government's bounty. Enforcement of most of the provisions of the Jones act also will be asked. Section 28, restricting preferential rail rates to shipments destined for export in American vessels, will probably be given special approval. Out of deference to the views of President Harding and Secretary Hughes, section 34, providing for the abrogation of commercial treaties which prevent the application of preferential duties, either will be ignored or disapproved, although many of the shipowners would like to have it enforced. Approval will be given to the proposal to extend the coastwise shipping laws to the Philippines. This would have the effect of barring foreign vessels from the trade. It is pointed out that opposition to the project has come mainly from sugar planters who are themselves protected by the emergency tariff actSHIP 

OWNERS APPROVE MARINE LIBRARY WORK ' Crews to Be Supplied With Boxes of Books. The purpose of the American Merchant Marine Library Association in organizing to continue the placing of useful books on board American ships has been unanimously approved by the executive committee of the American Steamship Owners Association, and the project has been commended to the friendly aid and support of the American public and the shipownlng community. During the war the American Library Association was enabled to place 2-50,000 books on American merchant, ships. J These books are made up In libraries that j can be shifted from one ship to another. The American Merchant Marine Library I Association, with offices at 82 Beaver i street. New York, has an organization | which can do this work of distribution, and has been promised the support of the | Carnegie Foundation if adequate sub[ scriptlons are also forthcoming from American shipowners and others interested. The association has taken over the marine work of the American Library Association, and it is planned to supply the crews of ships under the American flag with boxes of reading matter, both miscellaneous ond technical, with which their otherwise unoccupied time may be ! usefully taken up.
