fcfce e3ran ffalmr gttos. (irand IIaveu Michigniii WEDNESDAY EVENING, DEC. 10, 182. Winter Quarters. It U rumored that tbo Grand Army of the Potorrmc is logo into winter quarters nt Aquia Crock. We trust ibis is ft tnu tnkc. Thcro is something doleful, dis astrous in the very thought of winter quarters', for several hundred thousand men, iu tho present stalo of national af fairs, when winter seems to bo the most propitious time for military operations in tbo enemy's country. Thcro aro sovoral reasons, potent ones . too, that indicate winter quarters, nt tho present very bad quarters. I. Tho direct tendency must be to dishearten and discourago our soldiery, panting for a final victory and tho close of tho war. Twenty months have already past since tho call to arms, ono winter al ready spent in comparative inactivity, and but lilllo accomplished during tho past summer but preparation, as it would scorn, for a bold and successful winter compr.ign, and then for that campaign to fizzle out, can but bo discouraging, disheartening in tho extreme to thoso who long, as tho watcher for the day, to see their country onco moro free, and they again becomo dwellers at home, amid scones they love, and engaged in tho peaceful pursuits of remunerative labor. II. It is evident that tho rebellion must bo crushed on tho soil of tho rebell ious, if any whero; and it is well known to tho country, and thousands on thou sands of desolato firesides to-day bear mournful witness to tho fact that a host of valuablo lives, tho very flower of the army, during tho summer past, becamo a sacrifico to an unnatural climato. Aooth cr summer will doubtless prove still moro fatal than tho past to our soldiery, if com polled to remain, whilo tho winter is cm incnlly mild and salubrious, and every way well calculated for military opera tions, as wo should suppose. III. Tho war, if prolonged beyond tho present winter, through tho needless inactivity of our armies, must bo indefi nitely prolonged, and thereby a lax laid upon tho shoulders of tho peoplo for ils support exceedingly burdensome to boar, if not totally ruinous to both people and government. IV. If nothing to the purpose is nc nccomplishcd during tho winter, we bo licvo from foreign movements at present something more than a silent view will bo taken in our nfTairs by European powers an action instead that shall prove ex ceedingly ajmoying, if not disastrous to our cause. Therefore, in view of the fore going, and of many other cogent reasons, let us have during tho present winter a most vigorous prosecution of tho war. Let no other winter quarters for a moment bo thought of than thoso afforded in shelter tents through tho whole length and breadth of the enemy's country. Let every sword bo drawn from its scabbard and every musket primed for tho contest. Let a determination that knows no defeat bo depicted on the countenance of every officer and privato in our vast army, by land and sea, to terminate this hcart-sick-cning rebellion during tho coming winter, and wo believe it can and will bo done. Tho nation demands it At their hands, and wo believe will bo satisfied with no result Ehort of a comploto and final victo ry. Shall wo havo it! A Warning Relative to Iron-Clads. A writer at London to the Boston Commercial Bulletin says : It is well you aro just completing a fleot of moni tors. You aro likely to need them before Jong. Workmen aro engagod night and day on the Mersey, Clyde and elsewhere, in building somo tweuty iron clads which aro to see service in American waters. They are intended to convoy vessels into Southern ports. This I know to be a fact. My information is direct from thoso in tho confidenco of tho promoters. To disarm suspicion, it is pop ularly given out that this iron-clad fleet is being built for the Chinese government, but 1 need hardly tell you that Mr. Ma son and his friends form ono of tho chief contracting parties." Recent communications from ihe 21st Michigan Infantry stalo that only About three huudrod men can bo mustcrod for cfioclivo duly from the entiro Regiment. Tho run after Bragg, if not a wild-gooso-chasc, was a using up ono to that Regi ment, temporarily, at least. Promotion. Wo rojoico at tho promotion of Capt. Noah H. Ferry, to tho rank of Major in the 5lh Mich. Cavalry. Wo feel confi dent ho will fill tho post with great hon or and proficiency. Noah, we believe to to be true, bravo and patriotic to his very heart's center, nud just tho kind of men needed to close the war at onco. Wo copy the following in relation to his promotion from tho Detroit Free Press: Major Ferry.-Among tho many pro motions of bravo and deserving officers, no ono has gratified us moro than that of Captain Noah II. Ferry, to tho position cf Major of the Fifth Cavalry. When tho war broke out, Major Ferry volunteer ed as ft private, and insisted upon shoul dering a musket. But a man of his ca pacity could not long remain in tho rank?. Ho was elected Captain of a company at White River. Major Ferry is a man of real, genuine merit, and will prove him self nn nctivo and thorough officer, and increaso tho fame of Michigan in tho fiold. It always gives us real pleasure to speak well of thoso appointed to military posi tions, whatever may havo been their po litical affinities, for wo know full well that tho efficiency of our regiments depends much upon tho officers, and tho comfort of tho men. everything. Thero is no way of so cfl'cctually protecting tho men as to give them officers, who know their duly and havo tho courago to do it fearlessly, every regiment is nn army ; but with poor officers, those who aro incompetent, inef ficient nnd dishonest, a regiment is soon utterly demoralized and dostroyed. The Expeditions. Tho expedition under Major Goneral McClcrnnnd, for operations down the Miss issippi, is fast nppronching completion It U expected to move on or beforo the tho 10th inst. Tho corps d'nrmes will consist entirely of Western nnd North western troops, embracing thirty-two rcg i men Is of infantry, besides a largo force of cavalry nnd artillery from tho Ken tucky army. This force will cooperato with tho fleet of Commodore Porter, con sisting of ten gun-boats, nrmed with ono ono hundred nnd twenty guns. Colum bus is tho point of rendezvous. Vicks burg will nfford tho first formidable obsta cle to the passage of tho fleet. Tho con federates aro making preparations for a bold stand, ns is thought, at. Port Hudson, ono hundred nnd fifty miles nbove New Orlcnns. But little doubt wc think need bo entertained of a speody opening of tho Missississippi to tho commcrco of tho Great West. Banks' expedition, for operations on tho tho Coast and Gulf, is being pushed to ward completion with tho utmost alacrity Charleston, Savannah nnd Mobile nro doubtlessly destined to becomo ours soon through its instrumentality. Winter Sufferers, Tho nppronch of winter with all its promising plensuro nnd gayely to some, is but tho harbinger of want nnd exlromo suffering from cold nnd hunger to others, to say nothing of tho thousands of sufferers in our own large towns and cities. Tho distress in somo of tho manufacturing districts of England is really nppnlling. In Lancashire, alone, 150,000 operatives are out of work entirely, nnd 130,000 others employed only a portion of the timo. It is estimated that 230,000 in that shire, alone, aro dependent on tho Board of Guardians or relief Committee for food, requiring tho sum of thirty or forty thousand pounds n week to mako them comfortable If such destitution prevails in that ono locality, what must bo tho amount of suflering in tho aggre- gato of tho manufacturing districts of England entire f And what is tho causo f The accursed rebellion in our own coun try, cutting off the supply of cotton. An other argument why the war should bo urged to a most speedy conclusion. IIu inanity nnd philanthropy urges it. A benovolcnt gcntlcmnn in Buffalo of fers to give five hundred bushels of corn toward lading a ship for tho relief of tho suflercrs. Othcr., no doubt, fully alive to the claims of the poor, which wo havo always with us, will second tho good deed and do likewise not unmindful, in the meantime, of the poor at homo. Col. Ciiami'LIn, of the Third Michi gan Infantry, has been promoted a Brig adier General. It is deserved, and the pobilion will bo honored by tho incumbent. Fur the Newi. Local Correspondence. Mr, Editor: I perceive that you have noticed in your columns a Thanksgiving discourse, recently prenchod by mo, in tho Presbyterian Church, in this placo. It would havo been much moro congo nial to my feelings had you suffered tho discourso, prepared solely for the edifica tion of my own congregation and thoso who might see fit to unite with us in tho observance of a day of thanksgiving, to pass without any public allusion, whatev er, being mado to it. Whilo, of course, I appreciate tho kind ly motive which dictated your remarks, and mean now no reflection upon your intentions, allow mo to say th'at I fear a misapprehension may arise in the minds of somo in regard to tho drift of my dis courso from a single paragraph in your notice. It would cortaiuly bo very natu ral for the reader to infer from it that my discourso, cither altogether or for the most part, was simply a tirndo against Oarrisonian abolitionism- I hopo I had a better and nobler object in view than this, and if any present failed to discover what that object was, it was not certainly becauso I did not tako pains to bo under stood. How far I alluded to Garrisonian, or to any other typo of abolitionism, will bo soen by tho following extract, which I respectfully ask you to insert in this con nection. Excuso its length. I do not sco how I can mako myself understood by any shorter extract. In it is contained tho only allusion to abolitionism. Respectfully yours, D. M. C. "It matters very littlo, just now, what may be your individual opinion or mine concerning that most extraordinary polit icnl nnd social phenomenon of modern times, viz: African Slavery, embosomed in this free, democratic, christian republic. I may execrate tho system as ono unjust nnd cruel to tho black man, nud demoral izing to tho white man, and ardently pray for its extinction, in God's own way and time. You may bo a red-hot Garrisonian Abolitionist twin brother to a fire-eat ing Secessionist. Your neighbor may bo what, in my opinion, is far worse than ei thor, a negrophobiast, a ncgro-haler, ono who despises a negro simply becauso he is a negro, casting contempt upon a por tion of our common humanity, for whom Christ died, thus insulting God, tho Cro ator and Redeemer of humanity. It matters not, just now, what may bo your opinions, or mine, concerning slavery, as, it has been truly remarked, 4 wo havo been hurried past tho placo of argument against slavery. Wo aro done with all that; the books and pamphlets, thodocu mcnts and statistics aro growing quickly obsolete, for they havo dono their work ; wo need not bo careful of them for our future use. Wo shall not need them ex ccpt as relics of a woll-fought field.' I say it matters very littlo what may bo your individual opinion, or mine, concern ing slavery, just at this crisis, so far as tho final issue is concerned, since God is dealing directly with it himself. " Said n distinguished politician, to a gentleman, I frankly confess to you that for myself I tako no interest in tho ne gro; but, gentlemen, I am at a loss to conceive how any man can review the his tory of this rebellion without a clear con viction that Almighty Providence docs " So, wo say, whether wo take an inter est in tho enslaved African or demoraliz ed whito man, or in tho progress and ultl mate triumph of tho principles of civil and religious liberty, or iu tho proserva tion in its integrity of our glorious Un ion, with its 'time-honored' traditions and precious memories, Almighty Provi dence does, and is causing all things, oven this terrible war, to work together for our common good. Let us iu reverential awe stand still nnd sco tho salvation of our God." After tho present issuo of tho Netcs wo feel constrained to discontinue it to every one who has formerly regularly re ceived it gratuitously. Tho enormous advance of the price of printing paper and other material compel us to either adopt this means of lessening expenses or to considerably increase our old established rates of subscription, advertising and job work. Tho latter shall bo avoidod until every other possiblo means havo been tried and found insufficient. Let none of our friends tako it unkindly, for it is ab solutely a policy the times and circum stances demand of us. Retrenchment is now, more than ever, a virtue, nud should bo in every department of life tho ordor of the day. THE 

LATEST WAR NEWS. Cairo, Dec. 6. Advices from Memphis, 4th, state that Gens. Hovey and Washburn, with Steel's forcos, entered and took possession of Grenada, Miss., on Monday evening of this week, without meeting with any re sistance. Gen. Grant was known to bo in pos session of Abbievillo yesterday, and his advance aro pursuing tho rebels beyond Oxford. They may make a stand near Oxford, yet, if not, they must defend Columbus, Miss. Vicksburg is untcnablo if Columbus cannot bo hold. Then Jackson must also fall. Cincinnati, Dec. 7. Gen. Buell's official report of tho bat tle of Perryvillo is understood to bo a complete refutation of tho charges against him, and in consequence it is not per mitted to sco tho light of publication by tho cabinet at Washington. Its suppress ion is cruel injustice to a bravo and gal lant officer. Somo of his rovilors will squirm when it docs appear. Tho Union pnpors of Kentucky are so vore and threatening in relation to tho President's message. Washington, Dec. 7. Nothing of iutcrest has transpired in tho army within twenty-four hours. Officers stato that Jackson has nrrived near Fredericksburg nnd joined his forces with thoso already thero. Thoy also report that thocncmy has ex tended his lines several miles down tho Rappahannock. New York, Dec. 7. The Heruld says : " Tho Navy Do partment has received reliable information of tho whereabouts of tho pirate Ala bama. Tho Vnndorbilt sails to-day or to-morrow in search ef her." Philadelphia, Dec. 5. Advices from Fortress Monroe, yester day, announces the sailing of a fleet of several transports, and two iron clads, with scaled orders. Important Naval Experiments. Captain Ericsson accomplished a feat on Saturday last which will create almost as much interest in naval circles on tho oth er side of tho ocenn ns did tho famous conflict between tho Monitor nnd the Mcr- rimnc. By nn invention of his. four men sue cceded in working a gun weighing twen ty tons, in a turret. Indeed, so simple and comploto was his wonderful piVco of machinery that ono man could handle the gun with case, ihe practical importance of this feat will bo understood when it is remembered that it takos twenty-five men to work an Armstrong gun weighing four teen tons, and that for this reason a G8 pounder smooth-boro is considered tho best and most effective naval gun in the English service. So long ns wo retain the uso of Captain Ericsson s invention our iron clads can throw double, if not trcblo tho weight of nn English war ves sel, and with far greater case and rapidi ty. Naval officers who witnessed tho op eration of this now contrivance of Capt. ,ncsson declare that it will etiect a com pleto revolution in naval warfare, and will give us, for a lime at least, a decided ad vantago over any other nation in this im portant particular. N. Y. World. TriE Hero of the Monitor Afloat Aoain. Comrnnndcr Wordcn, whoso ser vices on the Monitor have been so highly appreciated by his country, will sail from this city next week in a belter ship than even tho Merrimac's antagonist. His oyes are well enough for duty, and his spirits excellent. Bv the laws of rank alone ho is a commander, no special promotion having been conferred on him. His new craft, tho Ericsson battery Montauk, now at tho Dolamotcr Iron Works, is nearly finished, and will bo ready to fight in a few days. 'Her now gun and turret ap paratus is receiving tho final touches, tho officers appointed by tho Navy Depart ment havo nearly all reportod to Admiral Paulding, and the guns aro already on board. She is even moro carefully com pleted than tho Passaic. Tho Woliawkon is hurrying up at Jersey City, and will bo finished soon after tho departure of tho Montauk. iv. J . World, Dec. 3d. Lumderino.

Tho Brooklyn Eagle, in noticing Henry Ward Boccher'e Thanksgiving sermon, which wns a racy affair, says: " When ho rounded of! ono of his pe riods by tho expression which Jerry Bry ant had added to the slang of the day Dat's what's do matter we can well believe that tremendous applause ' fol-lowod." Army Bread. A corresiwndent of the Springfield Republican says that the bread dealt out to our troops on tho Rap- Eahannock, was packed in May, lSui, ut must bo much older: during its pen insular campaign the bread became inhab ited by a very lively species of insect of a brown color and amiable disposition. Various stories are told of these crackers in camp, some of which I fear aro mali cious fabrications. One was that the in sects were purposely put in tho bread to save mule transportation, and that when tho commissary wished to transport the bread ho simply whistled and it cnino it self. Another was that four of the crack ers were seen on battallion drill ono eve ning, going through tho evolutions with great precision. Ono of Ihe boys had a lot of bread so thickly settled ns to be uncntablo, and brought it to the commis sary to bo exchanged. Ho was told to lay them down ana tako others, when he very honestly asked, " Hadu't I bettor hitch 'era !" Dr. Radway's Pills.
