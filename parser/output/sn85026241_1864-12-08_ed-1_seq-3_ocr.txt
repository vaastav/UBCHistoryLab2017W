It is a little remarkable that these Con perhcad church goers (?) are so ready to construe every referenoe by a Minister of the Gospel to the country, the officers of toe bovernment, or the officers and koldiers of the army, either in prayer or sermon. into "political preaching" and equally so that they should manifest ciich a persistent uuiui.uiuai.iwu iu loroe tuo ministry to quit braying "for those in authority," as di rected by Paul, or, if they cannot do this, to break up the oharches. They claim to be gooi tlmon men. but cannot tolerate a prayer for t'he success of the Union cause. They profess te be in favor of the overthrow of the Rebellion, but think it wrong for a minister to ask the Gad of Battles to hasten that event Thoy declare themselves in- laror of sustaining the Government, but the preachers should wot ak the Infinite to give wiadoui to these whose duty it is to administer it. They pro j'ess to be the friends of the soldier j but if minister, in his discourse on charity or benevolence, asks his oongrega'tion to con tribute of their substanoe to the Christian or Sanitary Commissions, they declare him apolitical preacher, and will not' go to hear btih. To such a remarkable erterrt have these Anti-Polnicar Christians Carried' their pre judiees upon this subject that they have de prived themselves almost entirely of ohurch privileges for, tVanfc Ged,' the churohes are loyal U the Gavommcnf, and the niin inters, true to her cause, and pruy for her success and the welfare of hei brave armies. The following Occurrence, we think, very fairly represents the extent td which these saints have carried their morbid sonnibili ties upon the subjuct of political preaching, and at the same time shows how ridiculous a position they sometimes take upon this subjeet: Two neighbors, in at. adjoining town in this eounty, belonging to different churches, met, and, their convention turn in g upon church, mattery one of them, whom we shall name Coppef, said : "I have quit going to ohurch, for the! preacher dot's nothing but pre.toh politics." The ether whom we will call Loyalty, .-aid:' ' Does your preacher preach ptilitios? " Copper" Yos; he can scareely .preach anything elre. " . '.:.'' Loy dty " Well, just do you come over next S.ibbath and hear our preacher. H. never mentions politics in the pulpit. " Copper " Well, 1 will coma and hear him, for I am thoroughly disgusted with political preaching, and would like to hear a sermon that had none ol It in it. " The nest Sabbath, true to his agreement, 'Copper, in oompany with Loyalty, went to liear the preacher who never preached poli tics. The minister took his text, 1 Peter,' A, 18: "If the righteous soaroely be saved, 'where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?" and preached a regular orthodox sermon. After service Loyalty said : ' Well, how did you like that sermon? " ' 'Copper" Pid n't like it at all j too uiuoh Ptobm in it.

It is heated by flues, well carpeted, is furnished with a chandelier, sofa, pulnit stand. &c, and will seat 500 persons. The choir is seated to the right of the pulpit, facing the congregation, which, we think, is a deoided improvement.
