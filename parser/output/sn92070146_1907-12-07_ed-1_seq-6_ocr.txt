California, nnder the Act of O>titfre«* of March 3, 1879. HELP FOR THE WEST SIDE In responding promptly to the call of the California Develop ment company for aid in keep ing up construction work on the canals required to restore water service to districts 6 and 8, west of New River, the water com panies of the valley not only act ed the part of good neighbors, but safeguarded the interests of Imperial County generally. It would have been a serious set back to the valley had the land west of New River been deprived of water for another year, for no amount of explaining would have satisfied outsiders that the condi tions were remediable or that a similar deprivation did not men ace other districts. The inability of the California Development company to fulfill its obligations was due to the fi nancial tie-up in New York and it was the only serious direct ef fect of the "prosperity panic" felt in Imperial Valley. It threat ened to cause great hardship to settlers across the river, and dam age to them would have reacted upon every interest every, land iowner and business man in the county. Right feeling and self interest require that stockholders give the companies quick and effect ive support in their measures for the relief of the West Side, and the way to do that is to pay in assessments at once instead of waiting until the last day of grace. ONE ASPECT OF THE MESSAGE There are several suggestions in the President's message which indicate that Mr. Roosevelt ""has taken notice of some of the re markable experiments in ration al government conducted by the people of New Zealand and has been impressed by the success of that remote island colony in solv ing problems that are still per plexing the statesmen and the people of this country. It is a fact that the President has been for some time keenly interested in the work of that social and po litical experiment station main tained in the South Pacific by men of the same breed that es tablished the American Republic, and it is becoming evident that his study of New Zealand achieve ments has influenced his thought on some of the questions con fronting this country. In some ways there is a resem blance of character between Roosevelt and the late Premier of New Zealand, Richard Seddon, whose indomitable force and ear nestness, combined with unusual political tact and shrewdness, ac complished the remarkable re forms which have made New Zealand the most prosperous and best governed country in the world. Premier Seddon was the strongest, biggest figure in the Southern hemisphere and he was hated and feared by the same class that looks upon Roosevelt with half-cowed malignancy— the predatory financiers and exploit ers of special privilege. 3eddon I made the same fight that Roose i velt is making against greed and ! long-tolerated abuse of the power iof wealth, and he won because !he was right and the jieople | knew he was not only right but i sincere. He had a very high op 1 inion of Roosevelt, and the Pres ; ident recognized the greatness of Seddon and his work. Two years ago, shortly before his death, Premier Seddon was asked by the writer what he thought would be an effective measure in restraint of the trust evil in this country and he re plied unhesitatingly that the first thing to be done was to restore the imprisonment penalty and send some of the piratical "cap tains of industry" to jail. Mr. Roosevelt now urges the import ance of punishing the individual wrong doer instead of exacting a money penalty from the stock holders of corporations. New Zealand is so far in advance of us in such matters that she has no trusts and no conditions fav orable to their establishment. She solved long ago the problem that we are fighting over. New Zealand has no destruct ive conflicts between labor and capital, no strikes, no lockouts, no boycotts. All disputes over industrial matters are settled ju dicially by a Court of Arbitration. Mr. Roosevelt knows what so called "compulsory arbitration" has done for New Zealand, and no doubt he would like to see the remedy applied here, but he re alizes that the approach to such a system must be by short stages and he does not invite defeat by urging too rapid progress. He advises as yet only "compulsory investigation" of serious labor disturbances, . relying upon in structed and intelligent public opinion to compel submission to arbitration as in the anthracite coal strike. New Zealand has a system of graduated land and in come taxation which goes far] toward discouraging mo nopoly and equalizing the bur den of taxes. The beneficial op eration of the system was demon strated long ago, yet the Presi dent of the United States ven tures no further than to hope that some way may be found to pass an income tax law that the Supreme Court won't kill. \ New Zealand in common with every other civilized nation ex cept the United States has the postal savings bank and finds it of vast benefit to the people. President Roosevelt is obliged to give Congress elementary infor mation on postal savings banks as a basis for his argument in fa vor of their establishment in this progressive country. It is a curious thing that the nation believing itself to be the most progressive, independent and enlightened and to have the best government ever devised should be following tentatively, and without intelligent compre hension of the fact that it is fol lowing instead of leading, one of the youngest, smallest and popu larly the least known of all the family of English speaking coun tries on the road to industrial and political common sense. Presi dent Roosevelt knows how far ahead New Zealand is, and that is so far that he dare not urge the United States to overtake her at a bound. 

CHAINGANG FOR HOBOES Imperial county is not disposed to tolerate an invasion of its ter ritory by any part of the army of hoboes that marches westward during the winter months, and by way of warning to all vagabonds i j j.l. t> j i * n and marauders the Board of Su- pervisors has authorized the sher iff to work prisoners in chain gangs under guards, to cease supplying tobacco and to furnish only two meals a day. t More than that the settlers in this part of the country have no patience with Weary Willies and prowlers of the roads, but they have shotguns and the will to use them where they will do the most good, and any skulker caught where he has no business to be, any hobo who attempts to intim idate women at back doors is go ing to be ventilated so thorough ly with shot-holes that his skin won't be worth tanning for shoe strings. This valley is not on any route to any place where idle men seek work and it is off the line of tramp travel. It is a sure thing that hoboes who leave the main line and invade this region are seeking only opportunity to plund er and make nuisances of them selves, and Sheriff Meadows has instructions to take effective measures to abate the nuisance. Marauders in Imperial county who escape the bucolic shot gun will suffer the worse fate of be ing compelled to earn plain grub in the sweat of their brows. ON THE REBOUND It is to be hoped that Mr. Har riman's buoyant belief that busi ness conditions will soon be nor mal will induce him to order re sumption of work on the projects in which the Southern Pacific is interested in this part of the State. In an interview in New York this week Mr. Harriman said: "We are in the rebound from the depression and we are in it to stay. There will be no falling back, each step that we are tak ing is firm. Underneath the whole situation there is an indus trial stability. There is too much work to be done and too great capacity for doing it to allow a long-drawn-out depression. ' The great stability of our in dustrial fabric is our commercial asset. On it we are extending our credit, as we must to carry on the great business of the coun try. The overstrain on cash is being relieved and credit is once more being allowed to perform its normal work. That is why I know we are on the rebound to a healthy and sound prosperity." The fall in prices of building materials in Los Angeles within the last few weeks is a matter of interest to the settlers of Imperi al Valley, and benefit should ac crue to the towns in which con struction work has been delayed by the disturbance of business conditions. Lumber, bricks and other material are one third low er in price now than a few weeks ago and there is a large supply of lumber in the Southern Cali fornia market. Freight charges from Los Angeles to Imperial Valley points, however, remain too high and make the cost of building greater than it should be. A reduction of rates would stimulate business of all sorts. Possibly John D. Archbold and other Standard Oil pirates really believe, as they say they do, that their loot is "the reward of hon est toil, devotion to duty and honest purpose, " but if they do, their moral sense is hopelessly atrophied. Capt. Kidd made the same plea. A new primary school for adults is needed in Imperial in order that the editor of the Standard may learn to read words of more than two syllables. Probably he could be taught to read, but it is too much to expect that he could be taught to think. Ltetyour lands with the Ira Aten Land Co.
