The tlcntli of the richest mnn in tho worltl nnturnlly enough cronies iv moro profound scn&ntlon than would the, denth of ono much greater otherwise. Tho Individual whoso ucoumulntlons mnount In vnluo to two hundred mil lions of dollars or moro exercises uti Immcdliitc power wlilch tho wealthiest intellect Is never conscious of possess ing, nnd occupies nn niitournllc height on tho cxchnitgi'R to which ouly his Bucccfsful mowy-gcttlng rivals und his heirs may aspire. Mr. "William II. Vniulerhllt was a roan of extraordinary business; capacity. Tho start of a hundred millions, wlilo.h his father left him, would havo boon to many men ft moro inauspicious bo glnnlrg than Jay dould's with nothing nt nil, but tho vast patrimony, that nt tcstcd tho energy nnd greed of tho old Commodore, foil into ssnfo and prudent lunula nnd through careful manage ment grew to its present colossal sUo. The millionaire thus blessed or bur dened with fortune, us tho caso miy be, was qullo ns democratic In his natlvo instincts ns his father beforo hiin, though a far less forceful char nclcr, nnd had many generous nnd kiudly qualities. It has boon charged that ho was in tho hnblt, now and then, of "d mining the public," but this Jlr. Vanderbllt strenuously denied. Ho was not of nn nrlstocratlc nature; what ever sympathies ho had, woro in the opposite direction, Tho effect of his death miy croato a temporary uncertainty nnd depression In tho stock. maikct, but nothing moro ecilous. sound on Tim TAinrr. Thnt portion of tho President's mc3 sngo concerning the necessity for tarlir icvislon ought to bo satisfactory to nil who favor n reduction of duties and tho correction of existing inequalities in tho tariff schedules. It is possibly too conservative to meet tho approba tion of those who urge sweeping and immediate reforms, but tho Ideas ad vanced havo tho advantage of being practicable nnd buslncss-llko. "Llko our currency laws," says face--rotary Stunning in his report, ''our tariff laws nro a legacy of tho war. All chnnges have left un changed, or changed for tho worso by new schemes of classification nnd other wise, u complicated, cumbrous, intri cate, group of laws, which nro not ca pnblo of being administered with Im partiality." Ileform, thcrcforo, means something moro than nn Indiscriminate razeeing of rates. Any Tcform, to bo effective,, must "begin with simplifying and prop erly codifying tho present system, In order that tho superstructure which Congress shall deem expedient to orcct, inay huvo a solid foundation to rest on. Tho reforms that nre needed, nnd they nro many, both In the Interest of importers ami consumers, must bo made gradually and with careful dis crimination in favor of homo interests. Any violent or abrupt legislation would bo much worso than uono at all. Says Mr. Cleveland: Tho proposition with which wo havo to deal Ij tl.o reduction of tho revunuo vooelved by tho f,ov eminent and Indirectly paid by tho peoplo Iroin customs duties. Tboquostfon of fre-o trado Is not Imolvoil nor Is there now juiy occasion tor tho goncrnl discussion of tho wisdom or cxpcdlcnoy of a protective systom. Ithlnktho rodnctlon should bo made In tho rovenuo dcrtvod (romn tux uiion tho Imported necessaries of life. Wo. thus dlroctlytessen thoeostofllvlngln every family of the land, nnd relenso to tho people In orory hatnlils homo a larger monturo of tho rewards of fru eal Industry; but Justice nnd fairness dlctato that Id 'm; modification o. our present i.iws relating to rovenuo, tho Industrie and inter rots which havo boon encouraged by snub lawn, and In which our cltlzcn-i haro lnrgo In veBtmcnts, fhould not ho ruthlessly Injured cr destroyed. "Wo cannot seo that it was necessary for tho President to Bay moro. "What tho reform needs Is a beginning, nnd hero la tho koy-noto to it. iir.r.i" roil youno womiin. They do many practical nnd philan thropic things In Now York nftcr nil, Thero has Just been laid in thnt city tho corner-Btono of n now building which will bo occupied by .tho Young Women's Christian Association. Thero la to bo nothing showy nhout tho edl lice, but it will bo comfortable, commo dious and n most useful ntldltlon to tho quarters of tho association. Tho building will bo flvo stories high nnd contain a largo library and reading room, a parlor, nn employment olllco mid educational and Industrial clas3 looms. 'With such facilities and proper management n very great mnount of additional good can bo ac complished. Tho fact that it required good management to provldo for tho building Is a gunrunteo that this bus!-ncss-llko sort of management will con tinue. Practical work iu helping young women to help thomselvcs Is not only tin Important undertaking, but ono of tho most urgent necessities of tho dny. When, llko .tho Stewart ITatel for young women, such cntc.rp"jl03 fall into sentimental and trnuscendoutal ways .they nio sure to fall; but if con ducted on n coinmon-sonso basis they nro equally euro to succeed. It appears that tho New York Young "Women's Christian Association J1R3 n record of twelve years of good work. Its objects tho .moral, soelal nntl physical Improvement of tho poor nd lowly ypuug woman of tho inotrop ohi linvu been most Miccessfully-riur,-, sued, It not only provides o tempo rary homo safo from tho contact of evil associations or tho rench of dcilgnlng Individual, but It secures places for .tho deserving and Instructs all who may wish to attend In rudimentary lirnnches of education, ono of tho prlvllegos wlilch It extendi, nnd by no means tho least Important, being free access to Its excellent library. All of tho work of tho Association has been done for $1)1,000, anil ns Dr. Taylor, who delivered tho nddross nt the laying of tho corucr-stono of the now building, very truly said, it Is dif ficult to comprehend how so much good has been nccomplbhed with an expenditure of so llttlo money. It Is nlro n gratifying fnct thnt Over ono hilf tho $125,000 which tho now building w 111 cost hns nlrcndy been raised. And -whnt hns been dono In Now -York through this noble benefaction is ciqvi hie of being dono olsowherc. Tho field Is largo and constantly growing larger. Thero should bo n similar Institution In every city of tho land. If tho conditions wlilch neccssllalo the work ennnot bo entirely ovcrcomo, tho enormous Buffering thoy cnlnll can nt lenst bo moro nnd more mitigated. Sill. Chaiilus P. Ituno.v of New York nnd General James U. Colt of Connecticut nro good looking nnd esti mable gentlemen and would no doubt fill Ihc respective positions of Scrgcant-nt-Armsntid doorkeeper of tho House of llepreseutallves with cnllro accepta bility mid inther moro than nvcrnge dignity. l!ut their melancholy ex perience In tho quest of votes for these positions must havo convinced them by this time that tho Ins and outs tho wheels within wheels, ns It wcro of political life in Washington, llko tho heathen Chinee, nro peculiar and full of perplexities to tho unsophisticated, licpubllcs ore seldom ungrateful to men who know what wires to pull and how to pull them. Our friends, llut ton and Colt, will see the point ns their Initiation proceeds. Till", meetings of tho American Pub lic Health Association, now in progress in tills city, nro of universal interest. Thero Is no subject In which tho people nro so greatly interested ns thnt of sani tary science, nnd the country is to bo congratulated upon tho evident fact that the cause has fallen Into such zeal ous nnd nblo hands. It would have delighted Jlr. Pen dleton to have been back In his old seat in tho Senato yesterday and heard that portion of the President's message re lating to ClvlhScrvlco Itoibtin. No wonder tho ex-Senator from Ohio is homesick. Sr.NATon Camkiion has Introduced n resolution In tho Senate to tho effect that It Is Inexpedient to pass nny tariff legislation nt tho present session of Congress. The Pennsylvania Idea seems to bo that what Is well enough for pig Iron should be let alone. To oun brethren of tho pross wo extend condolence. Mr. Vanderbllt, the richest man in tho world, is dead. So wo go.
