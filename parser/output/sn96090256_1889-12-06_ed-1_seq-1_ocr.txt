Public sentiment and a clamor for their abolition has set in to such an extent that trusts are not nearly so common as a year or two ago. An other cause which has served to mako "trusts" unpopular is the fact that it has been impossible to hold to the ex act terms of the agreement all the par ties to it. There were evasions in va rious ways in the shape of rebates and free carriage and other schemes, whereby one hoped to gain an advantage and sccure more trade. Are we to infer that combinations, and the object sought by a trust, 1ms been eliminated from commercial circles and commercial calculations? Uy no means. A much more formidable institution is taking the place of the trust—an institution having legal standing—an institution created not simply by the mu'ual pledges of men having a community of business inter ests, but an institution created by the mutual pledges cemented together by their capital. Immense corporations that swallow up all the smaller cor porations, are now the popular thing. For instance the National Steel Com pany. which is a corporation made up of all the barb and smooth wire manu factories of the country, and calculated to take in all the wire nail factories also. This is 110 trust, but an inline list company that calculates to absorb ev ery manufactory of wire fencing or freeze them out. This is the institu tion that takes the place of the trust, and it is an institution much more to be feared. The managers of one of the largest sugar refineries in the United States said that an immense corporation which would take in ail the refineries of the country, was the scheme on foot amng sugar men now. How much worse than a trust will this corporation be! This sugar combina tion li&w is striving its utmost to si lence and shut up opposition, But for the shrewdness of Clans Spreckles the trust would have annoyed him consi erably last week, How much more formidable opponent will this sugar corporation be than a sugar trust! These trusts of modern times have endeavored, and in a measure succeeded in deceiving the people by pointing to the cheapening of products as a result of putting the control of one article into the hands of one corpor ation. Fur instance, the Standard Oil Company say thev have cheapened the price of oil to the consumer. While this may be true, lioxv much cheaper oil might have gone nndci the influ ence of healthy competition can only I? conjectured. This is an undisputed fact however, that the members of the Standard Oil Company have within a very few years acquit cd collossal for tunes.. The conclusion to a thinking man is irres stible. However there is a bright spot in the future. A recent decision of the Illinois Supreme Court sustaining a decision of a lower court, has crushed the gas trust of Chicago. This decision discusses the question of trusts on principle and authority, and decides that such combinations are against public policy and therefore illegal. The court holds that the Chi cago Gas Trust Company has no power to purchase and hold the stock of other gas companies that such stock is not necessary to it in the manufacture of gas, and that the only object of owning such stock is to create a monopoly by controlling nil the other companies,and thus preventing competition. The anti-trust law passed last winter by the Missnuri legislature has been sustained by the courts of that state. It is well the courts have spoken thus quickly on this matter before the trusts become so deep rooted that they could not be uprooted. A plan to help increase the resources of the state has been devised by editor Conklin, of the Dakotian, and he will frame a bill and introduce it into the legislature. He claims that it already has the endorsement of enough mem bers of the legislature to ensure its passage. His plan is none other than to tax all mortgages on real and per sonal property. He shows that the assessed valuation on real estate is be' low the average amount loaned on the same, and'that it would bear an ad vance of 100 percent. By levying a tjx on the mortgages, which are usu ally held by outside parties, the amount collected on the land could remain about the same, and the mortgagee would thus pay hi-- just proportion of the bunion. In the discussion of the tariff by the president is the following which has the true ring in it: "These duties nec-1 essarily have relation to other things beside the public revenues. We can not limit their effects by fixing our eyes upon the public treasury alotie. They have a direct relation to the home production, to wages and to the com mercial independence of our country, and the wise and patriotic legislator should enlarge the field of his vision to include all of these.1' It is not very often that "Old Hutch," as he is familiarly known, gets "squeezed any on 'change, but he got a taste of what has so often, through his maniqulati'ons, been a whole meal for many a man. The bulls caught him short on 400,000 bushels of corn on Friday last, and his loss on that day was §20,000.. He made enough on wheat a few months ago so that he can stand a few days like Friday and still have enough left to make it decidedly uncomfortable for some other fellow or fellows, when opportunity offers, or rather when he makes the opportunity, The fifty-first congress has gotten down to business for the long session. It was organized with the following officers: Keed, of Maine. Speaker Ed ward McPherson,Clerk A.J.Holmes, Sergcant-at-arms C. A. Adams, Door keeper: James L. Choat, Postmaster William H. Millburn. Chaplain. All these officers with the exception of the chaplain, are republicans. Mr. Car lisle was nominated by tho democrats for speaker, but received only 154, while Mr. IJeed had 16ft. This is the relative strength of tho two parties in tho house, the republicans having, as will be seen, a working majority of 12. South Dakota gets much comfort from one subdivision of the president's message to congress, that being the por tion inferring to the opening of the Sioux reservation. After reviewing matters leading to and including the appointment of the Sioux Commission, together with the work of that body, he conclude: in the following language: "In view of theso facts, I shall not as at present advised, deem it necessary to submit the agreement to congress for ratification, but it will in due course be submitted for information." Now if the Hon. Cbns. Foster will be kind enough to let the report of the commis sion go to the president we can look for a speedy opening of the reservation. President Harrison's message while not a partisan document it is very for cible exponent of the principles ofjthe republican party. In no place docs lie more emphatically declare the purpose of the republican party to stand by the peoule than in the one clause of his message under the caption "Trusts" which reads: "Earnest attention should be given by congress to a consideration of the question how far the restraint of these combinations of capital, common ly called 'trusts' is a matter of federal jurisdiction. When organized, as they often are, to crush out all healthy com petition. to monopolize the production or sale of an article of commercial and general necessity, they are dangerous conspiracies against the public good and should be made the subject, of pro hibitory ar.d even penal legislature." The people of Faulk County have been agitating the question ot"the ad visability of bonding the county to purchase seed wheat for next spring, providing it is possible under the pres ent law for the county commissioners to borrow money for such purpose, l'he question has been brought before Attorney General DolUud, who gives his views on'the subject as follows: Section 1 of the article under con sideration prohibits the county from loaning its credit or making donations to, or in aid of, any individual associa tion or corporation, except for the nec essary support cf the poor. Does this exception confer upon the commission ers or the legislature the power to pro vide tho desired aid? The question is not free from difficulty but it seems to me that the line is to be drawn between the necessary support of tho poor and the support of the industries of the poor, examples of which—other than the one in view will suggest themselves to you. If the proposed aid is for the necessary support of the poor, there can be no doubt of the power to grant it in the manner that is now, or may hereater bo, provided by law. If, on the contrary, such aid is for the support of the industries of the poor, even though' it might result in their ultimate prosperity, it does not appear to me to come within the excep tion. As to the commissioners having the power to borrow money, I understand their power in that direction to be lim ited to the issue of warrants annually, in anticipation of the annual tax, or to the extent of their power to levy an annual tax, and the issue of bonds, so far as authorized by statute. The leg islature, however, would seem to have ample power to authorize counties to provide for the necessary support of the poor, either by taxation, or by is sue of bond®, subject tc constitutional Hmitflfiou."
