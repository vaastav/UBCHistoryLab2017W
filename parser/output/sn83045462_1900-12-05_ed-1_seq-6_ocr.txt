The anti-giade crosiing crusade which The Star has led for many years has had for its object the elimination of the grae crossings on equitable tern .. fair both to the nrorations and to tiw# community. The:- has nev(r been a time whe n the pub lie could not have abated the evil if it had be-n willing to relieve the railroads of the expense of the work. The community felt, howe *r. that it should be granted this re lief without being thus burdened. Bit th- railroads continu( to do the kill ing and maiming and to niage property and injure busness interests by unduly ob structing street crossings at grade. They have no legal right thus to murder and to d., this kind uf damage to property. On the other hand, they are under obligations to furnish decent and creditable terminal facilities. safe city trackage and attractive stali,nas in all of which obligations they have utterly and disgracefully failed to this time. Now that. to a considerable de giee through The Star's efforts, bills are pending to accomplish these great improve ments, it is especially important that the terms upon which the railroads are re quired to eliminate the grade crossings be etauitable. in short, that the railroads bear their fair share of the expense. Not only should the grade crossings be elIminated, but they should be eliminated on just teims. The public should not be robbed in order to prevent it from being murdered. The most obvious, staring in equity In the present proposition is the mil lion and a half contribution to the Halti more and Ohio. This item Is now being strenuously opposed by the board of trade. and should :ikewise be made the object of atuick by every other organization and in terest concernied in the welfare of the cap ital. The finanec:il condition of the District makes the danger of this enactment espe cially serious. The local revenues have been wasted by Congress in violation of the organie act in providing for the exten sion of future streets, exclusively at the cost of the District. After that imposition, to add this B. and 0. burden would involve so serious a problem that the case should be carefully analyzed before so heavy an obligation is incurred. The Star hopes to see the grade crossing bills passed at the present session, but first the outrage pro posed In the case of the B. and 0. bill shoulH be stricken from that measure. 0 4 The Message Abroad. Foreign comment on the message ought not to be displeasing to the President and his friends. Some of It is in a fault-finding key, but even that shows that the docu inent rings true. It is first of all an Amer ican presentation of matters for the Amer trans themselves, and if it disappoints peo ple here and there at a distance so much the better may we be assured at home here I that the President has scored a success. He is not playing the game of the foreign er. He is not playing the game with any view of injuring the foreigner, but his chief consideration is to advance the inter ests of his own people, and on distinctly American lines. His eye is on his own gun, and he wants the American powder kept dry. The November result need not mislead anybody abroad. The United States is go- I ing ahead with its gigantic task, but in its own way and sustained by its own re sources. It values all friendships, but it is seeking no formal alliances. It is an hon orable competitor for bus!ness, and its methods are and will remal i business-like, but it is not land-hunting ! r land-hungry. Its presence in the PhIlipp.aes is for pur poses frankly declared, and its part In the Chinese complications has so far been above fair criticism. We have suffered with the other powers at the hands of a treacherous Chinese government. and we are demanding redress of our grievances. But we are not figuring on a slice of China as pay for our losses, nor are we of opinion that a settle ment of any power's losses should be made insuperably difficult by too great exactions. For all the rest we stand where we have for some time stood. We are doing a large and rapidly increasing business with the world. and consequently are operating on the world's standard of value. Any other policy would be financial suicide. If the leading nations-our competitors for bust ness-should decide at any time for what is known as bimetallism in place of gold, the United States would take no risk in joining them, and probably would p)romptly dto so. But, until such time, gold will re rnain otur mon.ey of redemptIon. And, of course, the policy of protection will be as stoutly maintained. Freer trade is growing out of reciprocity arrangements, and in a few years there will be little' If any of the old complaint left of the more conservative of the tariff reformers. But free trade, pure and simple, is out of all calculations now in this country. andl our foreign rivals would do well to make a note of the fact. The P'resident in his latest message has fully and without exaggeration presented the country's whole case, and nobody, at home or abroad, need he in any doubt as to just where as a nation we stand. The sultan has been spared a great deal of trouble owing to the actte jealousies which pervade Europe. But the powers have had so much trouble with Abdul that t'hey might be unanimously rejoiced to see a disInterested party like the Uinited States step in and give him w'hat has so long been due hinm. Mr. lienderson with now proceed to malte up his mind whether he Is going to be a esar or not. The Eaglish Temper. The English people are to be congrattu lated upon the present slate of their tem. per. With many provocations to become irritated, they are carrying themselves with philosophical composure. The bait ings of an excitable neighbor are even de veloping their sense of humor. They are drawing the proper distinction between the lacket of vociferous street crowds and the attitude of those in office who are responsi ble for good government. It is an assuring sign, for thIs is a time when all men with reai heads should keep them on their shoul ders. Why thIs, outburst against England in France today? In a quarter of the world where the situation for all cIvilIsation i9 grave indeed those two powers are in the snain acting In concert. Their troops are fightIng, when fighting is necessary, side by side. if a French force in China were menaced by a superior force of Boxers. the English if within reach would gladly go to the rescue. And the Frencn would as gladly perform a similar service for the EnglIsh. The maint effort of all the powers is to continue this union of endeavor. If serioue and unbridgeable differences set up. the whole case will be lost. The pow era must.stand toguther it that In which all ... le..eted. end, jet h ........anest. of which all have embarked in this move went in China is to be cari-ed through. And yet, at the most critical stage of these proceedings, here comes a thunderous ar raignment of England by the French popu lace with the Boers as a text, and some talk in the French senate by an ex-secre tary of war about forwarding maneuvers designed to facilitate an invasionx of Eng land. General Mercier's talk would be 'mis chievous If it were not silly, and did not proceed from a thoroughly despicable and discredited individual. His idea is that "the times are not the same as they were a hundred years ago. Steam. the navy, the telegraph and the railroad have rendered the problem of the invasion of England much easier of solution. Moreover, Eng land herself is no longer the same. The Transvaal war has shown that the British army, although brave, is not equal to the task which England expected it to perform. The British navy is powerful, but it has many coasts to defend." The new agencies here named all con tribute not to the weakening .but to the strengthening of Eng:and against an in vader. With the telegraph to flasti the danger over the whole island in a moment, and ralilrads to rush troops to any given point on the ccast, it would take the mightiest of hosts to secure even a foothold. And against that host the whole of England would throw itself with passionate energy. Sup pose the telegraph wire stretched in every direction in Ch!na, and railroads grid ironed the country, and the people were armed and united in one purpose. How different their task would be for the allied powers of civilization! They could not even have put their present forces ashore. England has and need have no fears of an invasion. When Lord Salisbury intro duces the subject it is but a diplomatic stroke to strengthen English defenses else where. In the mouth of General Mercier the subject is simply amusing. Evicting the Vicious. The power of the city government of New York to purify the slums and particularly the "red-light district" was demonstrated yesterday. when, in obedience to the orders of the police. the proprietors and managers of the low resorts in that district moved out by scores. The scene is described as dramatic. It was a savage Indictment of Tammany Hall. The evils which were abated by the exodus of yesterday have existed for many months, in some places fo- many years. unmolested. A distinct bargain prevailed between the conductors of these resorts and the police, whereby the former were immune from molestation as long as they paid for protection. Until the word was given from a high place that the evil must he abated, this bargain was scrupulously kept by the police authorities. When the voi'e of the big boss broke silence, after one defeat and in the shadow of a greater political nienaco, there was a hrtIling for reform. At first the vicious classes were loath to believe that the corn mand could be sincere. They had huard many times that the municipal authorities were about to raid them, but they accepted the tip with a wink and made sure of the next regular payment. When the city be came wide-open after the stringen y caused by the Lexow agitation and later by Police Commissioner Roosevelt's determination to enforce the laws, this feeling of security was strengthened and the dive keepers were confident that there would be no disturb arce of the mutually profitable understand ing between them and the police. Their amazement when a police captain actually had the nerve to oust them from their places, therefore, may be imagined. What were the police good for if not to be bribed? Why should a mayor shrink before the indictment of a. mere bishop? Had not the big boss uttered words of moral sugges tion'before and whispered the pass W'ord in the next breath? And now they are out, the "red-light dis trict" is closed, and the city Is wondering where the reform will end. It ought not to end until Tammany. the organization that could have done this years ago and did not. has been forever crushed as a political factor in New York. It should not stop with one neighborhood, from which the outcasts may merely move into another, but it should proceed until it has covered every quarter of the town, until decency has been established as the rule, from which the law tolerates no departure. It should not pause to wonder what has be come of the wretched people who moved yesterday out of the East Side slums be cause comparative morality is to he the rule there hereafter. It should not hesi tate merely because some, of these of fenders may be merely driven from one city to another. It should proceed relentlessly, to make New York clean, and to demonstrate that there is no place in all the metropolis for law breakers, or evii doers, or bribers, or corruptionists, or gamblers, or thieves, or thugs, as long as the law exists to punish them and the force is at hand to apprehend them. Each city must solve its own prob lems of this character, and when all cities learn this lesson and proceed fearlessly to solve the problems, the standard of morality and right living will rise and continue to rise in every quarter. Richard ('roker's encounter with the Eng dish income tax collector will enable him to understand the pangs of some of the people whom Tammany has compelled to pay tribute. St. Louis can contemplate the isthimlan canal project without any fear that it will involve the town in any further sewage ecmplicattions with other cities. Leborgy, a French authority on fashions for men, declares that the Prince of Wales dresses badly. And Americans have been copying him all these years! The proposition to reduce taxes Is another hard blow at the man who is so mentally constituted that he thinks he is unhappy unless he is being oppressed. Every time father-in-law Zimmerman says "his grace" he justifies the appella tion by a recollection of the young man's 'felicity as a cakewalker.. Goi. Stone's Rennedy. The future of the democratic party re mains a live and interesting topic. Mr. Bryan and Chairman. Jornes have spoken for the democrats and Mr. Teller and Mr. Towne for the silver republicans, and all four are still in pretty close agreement. The "fight," as they express it, must go on. Nothing is settled, they insist, until it is settled right, and the right of all pres eat contentions is, as they believe, with the combination of polftical forces which in the recent campaign opposed the national ad ministration. The English of which prob ably is that. if that combination can be held together, Mr. Bryan is to try a third time for the presidency, on a plattorm which shall abate none of the leading de mands which have twice been made in the name of democracy. These men are now joined by Mr. Stone of Missouri, who talks.in their strain, and, having served with them in two campaigns, would probably not object to embarking with them for a third. After flouting all talk of reorganization on lines suggested by men of the Cleveland school, Mr. Stone. in the course of a long signed statement, says: "The democratie pat shiuld noct and cannot co=statatly mananet *ha- nuotaee' of any pie it ha. advocated, fer' it has advoctdnothiag that -wapt deine --de: .aut it -hsMa h-e-a- s Uni ant me"nwoere aggrangve Am 40Eihu Ia be ts epam tand-ls aisatf gleui..aa sTee. Ia ag p. am being discouraged. It is only necessary that we stand resOutely for the ritht. go on with the work ot education and organi zation (not reorganion), keep the party in harmony with the spirit of the age. while at the same time guarding our in stitutions of government, and we will tri umph in the end." How could the democratic party "become more aggressive" than it has been since the nomination of Mr. Bryan at (icago In 1806? The platform then adopted was aggressive to the last degree, and surely no candidate for offlce ever carried himself more aggressively than Mr. Bryan did in that cavipaign. The difficulty was, indeed, that both platform and candidate were too aggressive. They threatened too much. The couptry took alarm. The majority of the people would not stand for policies so extreme and advocated by a candidate so uncompromising. A shade lers of aggress iveness would probably have inured to Mr. Bryan's benefit. As it was, he went to de feat as the eloquent leader of a movement which was accepted as aggressive to the point of revolution. But Mr. Stone employs a second word. He says the party must become more aggress Ive and "constructive." There Is wisdom in that. But the difficulty is that if it 4 to become a constructive party the democ racy must abandon the Chicago platform. That is distinctly destructive. The people will not accept it In any other light, and for that reason many democrats have twice supported Mr. McKinley for Presi dent as the representative of the only "con structive" party of the country. - --- -e- .
