Fearful Atrocities of the Turks. BUTCHERY OF ARMENIANS. Tales of Crimes That Cannot Be Half Told. I MEN AND WOMEN SHOT DOWN And Little Children Slaughtered in Their Homes Without Ruth by Brutal Soldiery. Athkns, Dec. 3.— The Associated Press exclusively has been able to give to the world the facts of the terrible atrocities perpetrated up:>n Armenian Christians in Asia Minor, and to-day a representative of the Associated Press succeeded in serur luc additional information confirming the previous stateuif nts made. The repre sentative tc-day met twenty Armenian refugee?, who have arrived here from Ar menia after a journey full of hardships und suffering. >ecaring the service of a first-class interpreter, he gathered the Armenians together at a convenient place, ai.d having relieved their pressing neces- j Miie*. the interpreter questioned the refu gees concerning the terrible events vl which they iiad in a number of cases been eye-witnesses. I his p*rty of Armenians is j tne. first that has escaped from the iii-tricts where the massacres occurred and it is believed ;hat even worse remains to be tnld, as the horrors described are un derstood to have lasted for a lace time nfter this party left. Most of the persons who told their stories tc-day escaped from ] Moosh, latins and Sa&soun, bringing with j them wha: little they could carry and making their way with the greatest diffi culty to the Rnsso-Turkish frontier and gnins tn Knvan and Echmiadzin. Several Armenian women escaped from the vil lages with this party, but when near Erzeroutu they died from the effects of saber wound mtlicted upon them before tlieir escape. For abnut c gMee.n months, the Ar menians say, the province of Sassoun has been surrounded by Turkish tro< p* anrt nobody has b-en allowed to enter it or l<*ave. About four month? ago the Turk ish authorities learned that the inhabitants of Vartemis, * village outside the frontier of Sa-soun. were sending for the neces saries of life to the village of Dalvorig. Such communication between the two villages being prohibited the Turks mas sacred nearly all the inhabitants of Var temis. This waß the second massacre to c reur. The first took place abuut a year ■go. hip. of the refugees, a man named Khadjik, states that his urcle and aunt were both killed, the lntt*r beine assaulted bef re Deina put to dea;h. An Armenian priest named Keront was killed for refus ing to celet.iate Turkish rites in his church at Yar erois. The village con tained 325 Armenian houses before the Turks attacked it, but when the fugitives left only twenty-five houses remained standing. Dalvong is the largest village ie the province of Sassoun, and its inhab itant, when they learned of the horrors perpetrated by the Turks at Vartemis, attacked the Tnrkfl on the frontier. The Turkish commander eventually sent tiers into Dilvorig to learn what ). ..i occurred. The Armenians, filled with irdigna tion at tdo atrocities committed by tnn Turks at V.irtemls, attacKed this de tp.chroent of Turkish soldiers and rut them all to death. When the Turkish commander heard of the death of bis sol diers he determined on vengeance in the most bloody n.anner possible. A strong fnrfe of Turkish trnops was sent to the village with artillery, a-.d the massacre began. Guns kent up a continuous fire upon Daivorig until practically not one &toue wag left standing npnn another, $?10, the Bey of Initzouu, a Kurd, with a detachment ot Kurdish cavalry, went witn trie Turkish soldiers to the village, of Semal and forcibly took the Armenian from his church aftsr defiling t;ie sacred vessels and the priest's hands. They bound him en a donkey, which they drove a di**ance of a lew yards, and the soldiers then fired at the priest and killed him and the beast he was bound to. In the same village, the Turkish soldiers entered an Armeuian house and assaulted a woman and her daughter, thfl latter be inc 14 years of age. From this village S«'lo forcibly took eight Armenian girls and sent them to his harem at Initzoun. Further atrocities were committed by the Turks at the village of Keliehuesen. Before dawn this place was surrounded by soldiers, and while the inhabitants were still asleep it was set on fire. The brutal soldiers entered the residence of n man named Araket and tortured him tn a horrible manner with redhot irons. At Kdiehuesen the soldiers killed the Ar menian prest Margosa, with twenty other Inmates of a house. They were burned to death, the soldiers preventing anybody from escaping from the burning dwelling. The chief <>f the villnge of Cheneg was captured by the soldiers and bound to his twn daughters. All three were then scalded to death with boiling water. A detachment of twenty-five regulars of the Turkish cavalry, after committing Inex pressible horrors at the village of Seb g:;ank, went to the village school and assaulted the girls found there. The cav alrymen devastated the building. Ibn Hey, the notorious Kurd brigand of the village of Djibrand, and a colonel in the regular army went with a detachment ot Turkish trcps to the Armenian vill.ig«s of Bahlou, Hatezgent and Koruka, and at each pUce committed every crime there is to commit. Atier driving out the men, they collected the female children of Ban lou together, about 200 In all, and, after as saulting them, killed them all with guns and swords. After this massacre the Turkish soldiers regaled themselves with wine and whatever else they could find in the village. The Kurdish regular troops from Kizan and Bahran entered the Ar menian villages of Allanozig and Aghleg, killed the inhabitants and wrecked their bouses. The number of villages devas tated in this manner is said to be ovrr lhirtv-two. >The Armenians fled In every direction, but many of tbem were captured by the Turkish troops hefore they could get away aati irero takes to prison. Kbadijak, who The Morning Call. was the prioeipal spokesman of the Ar menian refugees, told the whole story iv a most convincing manner. Dr. G. Thoumaiii, a woll-known Ar menian, has just received a let er written on September 29 from Todorian, a village near Erzeroum. The writer says: "How can I write such horrors of our life for the days since the 14th. Mounted robbers rode up to this village an hour after sunset and immediately begau an indiscriminate attack upon the Armenian Inhabitants. Over 200 shot* were fired at the house of the Rev. Mr. Z>okis, pas tor of the Protestant community, who was absent from Erzeroum. Three balls struck the pastor's wife in the face. She subse quently died from the effects of her wounds. Sume poor people from Khuoos, who were living in the basement of the castor's house, hurried up-tair^ when the iiriug was going on. and all of them were wounded. Mr. Richardson, an American missionary, came from Erzeroum to nttend the funeral of the pastor's wife. On Sep tember 25 a band of robbers committed murder at Anting and carried off cattle. AtDodythey bmke into houses and plundered ttiero of their contents." Dr. Thoumain was formerly a professor a 1 the American college* at Marsovau, and, i had himself been the victim of cruel perse cution at the hands of the Turks in 1893, when serious disturbances occurred in various parts of Armenia, and scores of innocent Christians were thrown into prison and the Christian college burned. On representations made to the Turkish Government by the Department of State of the United States Dr. Thoumain was pardoned. AS TOLD BY THE TURKS. It Was a Revolt in the Province of Sassun. Washington, Dec. 3. — The Turkish legation to-day furnis&ed the Associated Presn with an official telegram received by the Minister from Turkey relative to the trouble in Armenia. He says it has been ascertained that the agitators, originally from Rnumanta and Greece and recruited iv the Caucasus, took an Important part in the Sassun rebellion. It was the Arme nians of the Talourie district who started the revolt, attacking Mussulman villages. TrooDS were immediately sent, who never employed more than seventy or eighty Kurds. The facts show that far from committing any cruelties, the regular trooi>3 succeeded in restoring peace and order. Further proof that there was no persecution of any sort is the fact that peaceful Armenian villages, not partaking of the revolutionary movement, were left in perfect security and unmolested. REILLY LOSES HEART Not Much Faith in His Fund ing Bill. John Boyd Says tbe Central Pacific Does Not Want the Measure Passed. Washington, Dec. 2.— For some reason or other .Representative Reilly of Penn sylvania, author of the "Pacific Roads Funding BUI" and chairman of the Com mittee on Pacific Railroads, is no; as earn estly advocating his hill as at the last ses sion. Representative Cannon of Califor nia says that he talked with Reilly and tbe latter seemed very much downcast over his defeat for re-election. Judge Maguire has also noticed Reilly'a apparent change of mind, but is at a loss to know how to account for if. Some of Mr. Reilly's col leagues from Pennsylvania say that he ex pected aid from ttie railroads in his fight for re-fllection, but that thote roads, which are triendly to Huntington and his inter ests, failed to come to bis aid. In conversation with The Call corre spondent to-night Mr. Reilly seemed half hearted about his bill, although be still contended that it was the best measure yet devised. "Provided," said he, "that it can Oe successfully enforced, and there seems to be some question as to that. I think something will be done this session, though I do not know what it will be or when the matter will b? brought before the House. I have not spoken to any members of the Rules Committee and do not know what their disposition is about giving our committee a day for the bill's consideration. In a few days my com mittee will meet and I shall execute its instructions. I shall not make any effort to call tbe bill before the House unless 1 am instructed to do so." Southern Pacific Lobbyist John Boyd said to-night: "This Congress will not do anything beyond passing appropriation bills. Reilly's bill will not paes. We do not want it to. We want 100 years' exten sion. Nothing less will satisfy my people." When asked what would happen on January 17, when first mortgage bonds for 52.000.000 mature, Boyd said : "Oh, well, tbe sinking fund will cover that." Chairman Reilly says be does not know what would be tbe result of inaction by this Congress. "It is a grave legal ques tion," said be, "whether a default of pay ment on the bonds wbicti will mature in January will forfeit tbe entire road to the Government. Only litigation can determine this, ami it will be long drawn out litiga tion, too." flic Californians here regard it as barely possible that Messrs. Reilly and Boyd are "playing possum," and thai while appear ing neglectful or indifferent they may be making a mill hunt. SWAIM TO BE RETIRED. Cleveland Will Set a Precedent in His Case. Washington, Dec 3.— The announce ment of the President's intention to retire Judge Advocate General Swaim this month has caused much speculation in military circles as to the succession. Under ordinary circumstances General Swaim would uot retire before 1896. The Presi dent has adopted a course which, while perfectly leeal, has very few precedents in lite history of the army. Up to this time but two names have been prominently mentioned for tbe suc cession. One is Joseph Doe of Wisconsin, Assistant Secretary of War. ana the older is Colonel C. H. Lieber of South Carolina. Mr. Doe has, however, publicly denied any aspiration to the place, and it seems very probable that the office will tall to Cnlnnel Lieber. who has, since General Swaim's suspension, discharged the duties of judgn advocate general.

FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1894. TERMS OF PEACE. Japan Wants All She Has Won AND MAY ASK FOR MORE. Rather Hard Fortune for Poor China. MUST ASK FOR MERCY DIRECT. The Longer the War Is Prolonged the Worse It Will Be for Her. Tokohama, Dec. 3.— According to the semi-official press Japan has decided to insist upon heavy conditions of peace, which will be increased as the war is pro longed. If the war is concluded now Japan would acceDt 400,000,000 yen and the cession of the territory now oc cupied by her forces. If Toku and Shan Ilai Kwan cannot be attacked this winter because of the climate, the war will be pushed to other parts of China. No ar mistice is to be granted, unless China formally sues for peace and surrenders Peking, or gives other pledges in propor tion to the demand of Japan. It must be stipulated that Japan's power is absolute. OUTRAGES UPON A PRIEST. Fiendish Work of the Bigoted Peas ants of China. St. Louis, Dec. 3— A letter received from Father Hugh, O. S. F., a missionary priest in the province of Shensi, in China, contains an account of outrages, of which Rev. Father Capislan Goette, formerly of St. Louis, wag the victim. The letter is dated September 18, and is addressed to the provincial of the Order of the Sacred Heart in this city. It nays that on the 9th of September Father Goette was assaulted by natives, who drove off bis Chinese ser vants and carried him a prisoner to a neighboring market town. At the time when the assault was made the fattier was engaged in locating and makine claims to lands belonging to the church. For a whole day ho was exposed to the Indignity of the populace, who vented their rage by beating him, spitting in his face and striking at him with their long brass-headed pipes. They tore his face witn branches of thorns and com mitted other outrages. An attempt was made by his captors to shoot him, but fortunately the old firelock gun used by the Chinamen did no-t answer its trigger. One of the spectators offered to kill him for three franc?. From this town Father Goette was con ducted to the gates of another market vil lage, where he was treated in the same manner as at the first town. It was in tended to put him to death at the third village to which he was led, but the head man of that district declined to assume the heavy responsibility, and the prisoner, who was securely bound, was drawn ouL into t*e fields. His tormentors here stuffed his mouth full of dry clay, then some held him close to the ground by the hair while others knelt upon his prostrate body, and one of them applied a long kuif^ to his* neck. The Father was able '.o grasp the arm of the would-be murderer and some of the Chinese also protested against this extreme act, and lm life was saved. His captors finally concluded to throw him into a well, but the timel7 arrival of an official saved his life again. The condition of the unfortunate father was most deolorable. He was covered with bruises and knife wound 9, and for a time his state was critical. At the date of writing he had recovered physically, but still suffered aberrations of mind, due to his great sufferings. The letter concludes by sayiug that the Chine-e Government was dilatory in taking steps looking to the punishment of the offenders and making I reparation for the crime. BODY STEALERS ON TRIAL. Women in Court Wear the Colors of the Defense. Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 3.— The case of the Mate against the Conner University students, professors and janitors for body snatching Is being vigorously contested. The defendants, visiting students and their lady friendß in court this morning all wore ihe colors of the university, red and orange. Previous to the opening of court an excursion was made to the receiving vault in Wyuka Cemetery. This was a move on the part of the defense for the purpose of rebutting evidence relating to the identification of the remains. The case for the defense hangs upon this point. Defendant J. A. Burford was the first witness. He testified that he and Mehan were student janitors of the university. He denied having said at the time the body was carried dowiißtdirs thst it wns heavier than when it was carried up. This contradicts the testimony of Trustee Byer. The prosecution demanded a sam ple of Burford's handwriting on the thoory that he wrote the letter purporting to come from a Chicago man offering to furnish the college the body claimed to have been stolen. It was granted and was not similar. AFRAID TO SPEND MONEY. The Nicaragua Canal Bill to Be Shelved This Session. Washington, Dec. 3.— Judge Maguire says that, next, to the Pacific roads funding bill, the pending leeislntionraost important to California is the Nicaragua canal bill. He will give this matter his earnest atten tion. So will Cannon ot California, who, however, will oppose any bill that does not vest this Government with absolute comrol. Senators Morgan, Frye and Dolnh to day expressed themselves as earnestly in favor of some action at this se-sion. The probabilities are thai with all the work that can be done by the canal promoters, the Democrats will not pass the bill. It seems to be the general impression that no important projects involving the expendi ture of money or the issuance of bonds will be undertaken by this Congress, and only appropriation bills and routine legislation will be enacted. Although President Cleveland strongly recommends the build- ing of three new battle-ships and twelve. torpedo-boats, it is not even believed that this Congress will be willing to appropriate the muney. Representative McCreary, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, says he does not expect many mat ters of importance will be brought before the committee at the pres ent session. The committee has not given the Nicaragua canal any special at tention. He thinks thac where the Gov ernment is to expend or guarantee $75,000, --000 or $100,000,000, great care should be exercised, and the Government should not bo rashly committed to an enterprise of such magnitude. 

SENATE RULES. A Movement to Introduce There the System of Tom Reed. Washington, Dec. 3.— There was more or less talk ou the Democratic side of the chamber during the day about the import ance of a change in the rules of the Senate which culminated late in the afternoon in the introduction of a resolution by Sena tor George looking to that end. Tue resolution tiiivctg the Committee on Rules to report at the earliest practicable moment such amendments as will enable the Senate to reasonably discharge tbe legislative functions imposed udou it. The resolution specifically provides that tbe Senate shall have power to come to a vote on any pending question after giving such reasonable opportunity for amendment and debate as tbe Senate may decide to be proper, and to compel the attendance of a quorum; that for the purpose of making a quorum all Senators present may be counted without answer ing to their names, or that a Senator pres ent who fails to answer to the call of his name shall be punished for disorderly behavior. 

REFORM IN NEW YORK Plans Being Considered by the Seventy. There Is a Movement on Foot Also to Forfeit the Charter of Tammany. Nr.w i'ORK, Dec. 3.— The Committee of Seventy is preparing a statement for pub lication setting forth its position as re gards the more extended and detailed re forms which it has receutly decided to undertake. This statement, with the sub committees' charged with investigation iv the various defjartments of the city gov ernment, will probably be complete by to night or to-morrow. Charles Stewart Smith, chairman of the executive comnii - tee, said yesterday that the subject of small parks, concerning which there was a plank in the Seventy's platform, would be carefully considered. The civil service laws, as they appear to those holding po sitions in the police and the Board of Excise, Mr. Smith said, htJ b^Cu ,'v subject or careful study by Mr. Bernheim of the Seventy, and it was tbe intention to make a thorough and systematic in vestigation of this subject. Considerable attention will be paid to the subject of removal of garbage, and the committee has already some reports on the systems iv London, Berlin, Paris and Vienna. Mr. Smith said it was the inten tion of the Seventy to make an investiga tion of this matter before tbe board of estimate makes up its next budget, with a view to considering if the present appro priation is sufficient. A commission will probably be appointed to examine into the entire expenses of maintaining the city government and making comparisons with those of other large cities. The tenement house question will also be considered. The Good Government Club.of which John Brooks Is the president, has appointed a committee which is going to call soon upon the Attorney-General. He will be requested to bring to the attention of the courts the violation of the charter of the Tammany Society of the Columbian Order whereby the latter will be com pelled to show cause why its charter should not be annulled. Club F and Mr. Leavitt claim that the Tammany Society has vio lated that provision of its charter which stipulates that the society shall never have an income from real estate exceeding 15000. It is also claimed that the charter ti us bepn violated In reference to the pro vision that it shall have a pension fund devoted to the widows and orphans of its members. They assert that if there be such a fund in the hands of the society it is never applied and therefore the neces sity for the existence of the society ceases. It is claimed by the members of the society that there is such a fund and that it is ex pended for the relief of needy members when occasions arise. 

BUTLER'S HARD FIGHT. Not Yet Ready to Lose His Seat in the Senate. Columbia,S. C.Dec. 3.— ln the Supreme Court this morning Senator Butler's peti tion lor an injunction restraining the State Treasurer from making payment of sal aries of Supervisors of election registra tion was held. The attorneys for the Sen ator claim thnt the registration law is un constitutional and his supposed intention is to have the recent general election set aside as illegal and thus vitiate the legality of the .Legislature now sitting and which will elect Tillman as his successor. Attorney-Genoral Buchanan for the State took the p>sition that General Butler, hav ing heretofore acceded to the constitution ality of the law and been a beneficiary un der it by repeated election to the Senate, whs barred from attacking, also that he could bring no action of purely abstract nature. Argument iR not yet completed. GROVER IN WASHINGTON. The First Time He Has Been There Since his Illness. Washington, Dec. 3.— President Cleve land came to the White House at 10 o'clock this morning. It was tbe first visit he bad made to the city in two weeks. He came alone and was met by Mr. Thurston when he entered. The President looked very well, considering the severe illness be bad suffered. The only outward sign of his ailment is the pronounced limp which characterized his walk from the carriage Into tbe house. There were very few callers in the morn ing, the only one of note being Captain Hutchings of Mi»9issiDPi, who, in behalf of tho Speaker, came to inquire whether th* President would receive th« commit tee of notification at the White House. Harper's Bazab Klves correct Information about fashions lor everybody, for $4 a year. * FOR A 

BRIEF TIME. Congress Once Again in Session. WELCOME TO TOM REED. He Is Felt to Be the Coming Man, SOME FLOWERS FOR THE DEAD. Warhorses Who Will Retire Not Forgotten in the Giving of Floral Offerings. Washington, Dec. The opening of tbe short session of tbe House was pictur esque in a way, but devoid of interesting features. The victorious Republicans ami the defeated Democrats exchanged greet ings, and gave and took thrusts on the re sult of the recent political battle with much animation but thorough good-nature. The galleries were crowded, and half the desks on the Iloor were smothered with flowers. Congressional veterans who bad spent a good share of their lives in the House came in for their final session, the tidal wave having retired most of the leaders of the majority. But there were few discon solates among the defeated, and they joined with the members of the minority in good-natured sallies. Representative Holman of ludiana was greeted w»rmly by his own frieuds. The l»iders on both sides got enthusi astic receptions from their respective par tisan*, the appearance of Speaker Crisp, ex-Speaker Reed, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Burrows being the signal for long and loud outbursts. There was no chance in the first day's proceedings for reference to the elections, so tne actual proceedings were dull and uninteresting. Seven new members were sworn in, and after a long •vait the President's message was read. Although it was listened to with interest it was concluded without a mark of ap proval or disapproval. Judge Maguire was the recipient of many congratulations on the floor of the House as tbe only California Democrat elected to the Fifty-fourth Congress. His desk was ornamented with several beauti ful floral gifts, one in particular — a large horseshoe of roses — presented by Cali fornians resident in Washington. Accom panying it was a card with the words: "The voters of the Fourth Congressional District of California will never take the horseshoe from the door till it is removed to the Speaker's chair." Of the California de'egation there were present at tbe Capitol to-day: Senator Perkinß and Represuutatives Maguire, Bowers and Cannon. Senator White will leave Los Angeles to-morrow for Wash ington. Senator Perkins has taken apart ments at La Normandie Hotel. Judge, Maguire and wife are at the Ebbitt House.

SUGAR SAYS A WORD. Havemeyer's Reply to President Cleveland. The Head of the Administration Has Learned Nothing From the Late Elections. New York, Dec. 3.— President H. O Havemeyer of the American Sugar K»fm ine Company ttiis evening gave out tbe folio wing signed statement: - If one will fairly and dispassionately con sider tbe President's recommendation it will become apparent that It comes down to tills: "The sugar company bas taken action, the result of which is to de prive temporarily of work 25.000 per sons employed In tbe various industries dependent upon tbe refining of sugar, together with the members of their families. 1 recom mend such action as to deprive those persons of work permanently. If (be Industry is languishing tbe proper course Is to destroy it." There are some things which can be estab lished tbroueb a demonstration, a compari son of the duty put by the tariff bill upon vari ous articles will show that while the maximum protection accorded to sugar is 5 per cent, other and more favored articles receive protec tion up to 40 and 50 per cent. Why this discrimination should be made against a large number of persons who hold the stock tn the company and are employed in its refineries it is Impossible to say. They pro test against it. The answer to this protest in the President's message Is. as the present pro tection is inadequate, it ouKht to be removed altogether.

RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO WORK. The Time Has Come When Their Demands Must Be the First Considered. New York, Dec. 3.— John Burn?, M. P., and David Holmes, M. P., the English delegates to the annual conference of the American Federation of Labor to be held in Denver, spent a busy day. In company with Samuel Gompers they made a trip through the Bowery and viewed the tene ment-houses on the East Side. To-night a mass-meeting of the trade unionists of New York and Brooklyn was held in Cooper Union. Samuel Gompers presided and Messrs. Burns and Holmes were the principal speakers. David Holmes, who is chairman of the Textile Fabric Association in England, said it would be the.duty of the workers in America, as thpy had done in England, to put down faction and Insist unon united action. Chairman Gompers in introducing Mr. Burns referred to him as the hero of Trafalgar square. Mr. Burns was received with an ovation. "We are determined," said he, "that the American workingmen shall unite in one grand movement, an International movement, unfettered by race, or creed, or color, and join with the workingmen in the Old World for the emancipation and amelioration of all those who sam their bread by hoi.est labor." Here some one shouted. "Three cheers for the socialist labor party !" at \vh cli the speaker appealed to Chairman Gompers to keep order. "I have in England, the land of anti quated constitutionalism, of effete mon archy, received fair i>iay, and here in this land of freedom I expert to receive it. I shall stay here in any case until I have my say." [Cheers.] Speaking of the pensions paid to the veterans of the Civil War Mr. Burns said : "These men fought for a great people. It was right to reward them. But if you deem it right to reward these men who at best were pirakers in the bloody and brutal trade of war, do you consider that tbe toilers in the slums, the men who, in removing garbage from your streets,- inhale malarial odors which brine tnem to the grave; the men who, in the mines of Pennsylvania, lose their lives in obtaining for your homes light and heat; men who toil in tbe fur naces of Pittsburg and other cities— do yon not think that the families of ihose men whose lives have been lost in peace ful employment, or who, broken down in health, wear out the ends of their lives in your slums, amid misery and itarvation. are more worthy of pensions than those who fought in battle?" [Cheers.] Mr. Burns concluded by saying that he had more pity for the American women than for the men. It was they who dad the gieater privations. He appealed to all workingmen to unite and they would "ere long succeed in carrying out the principles of true socialism." When President Gompers arose to intro duce John William Bnnn, M. P., he was greeted with a btorm of hisses. These came from a strong contingent of the so cialist labor party, and the din became so general that Mr. Benn di 1 not speak. NEW
