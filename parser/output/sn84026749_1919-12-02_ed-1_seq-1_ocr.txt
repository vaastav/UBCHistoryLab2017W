His motto ?earns to be "(ret the ooys into jail before Christmas." He ran for Senator against Newberry. Ford spent not a dol lar. The people could take or leave him. he wouldn't buy the SenatorsJtip. So the people left him, believin?: apparently that it is possible to overdo "the pure in spint" idea Newberry's friends admitted that they spent for him $176,568, although the law says you mustn't spend more than $10,000 to make a man Senator, no mat ter how tis-eful he may be to you after he gets in the Senate, and the would-be Senator mustn't spend for election more than one ?**-_u__rter of his salary, namely ene-quarter of $7,500. A grand jury in Michigan in dicting Newberry and 1.3 others fer bribery and election fraud say* that five hundred thousand to a million dollars were spent to make Newberry Senator. Doaens of little election swin dlers are said to have confessed, after being neatly tricked. Gov ernment detectives pr.tended they ??vere agents for another rich man, desiring "honor." The de tectives purposely bid too low, and the guileless local politicians told how much Newberry agents had paid. That supplied evidence. An indictment is not a convic tion; every man accused m entitled to his day in court before condem nation. Thla ia sure. Mr. Newberry is entitled to a seat in the SENATE or in the PENITENTIARY That may seerz a rough presen tation of truth, but it need not worry anybody The penitentiary aeat will remain empty We do not Imprison very rich men in this country, and we do not imprison men for buying seats in the Senate of the United Sutes At this particular momeot much attention is being centered on the importance of discouraging "class Wired.

Democratic leaders, including James Hamilton Lewie, former Ad ministration whip in the Spnate, were reticent on the subject of a third term, but that was taken as an indi cation that they want to show they are behind the President in the peace treaty fight and will name no one else until a new issue becomes para mount At the same time, some''Dem ocrats declare a majority nomination for William McAdoo, son-in-law of the President and former Secretary of the Treasury, probably would be taken as whole-hearted Indorse ment of the Administration policies.

President's Message To The Congress The text of the President's message to Congress follows |To the Senate and House of Representatives: 1 sincerely regret that 1 cannot be present at the open ing of this session of the Congress. 1 am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as I could wish th?? many questions that are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, 1 have had the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thought ful recommendations 1 earnestly second. In the matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs growing out of Federal control. 1 ?shall take tho liberty at a later date of addressing you. I hope that Congress will bring to a conclusion at this session legislation looking to the establishment of a budget system. That there should be one single authority responsi ble for the making of all appropriations and that appropria tions should be made not independently of each other, but with reference to one single comprehensive plan of ex*>ondi ture properly related to the nation's income, there can be fio doubt. 1 believe the burden of preparing the budget must, in the nature of the case, if the work is tb bo prop erly done and responsibility concentrat-ed instead of ttodd?*!, rest upon the executive. The budget so I1" pfll$*.f.?i.l.M be subnitiied to and approved or amended by aj mittee of each house of Congress and no singl, tion should be made by the C-oa^rt?ga, eiwpr i have b-r-en included in the budget prepared by.i or added by the particular comriiittee of Con$ with the budget legislation. t * Urge? Permanent Auditors in Treasury. Another and not less important aspect of the problem is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with I which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under exist- j ing law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining1 whether expenditures have been lawfully made within the appropriations. No one is authorized or equipped to ascer tain whether the money has been spent wisely, economically., and effectively. The auditors should be highly trained offi cials with permanent tenure in the Treasury Department, free of obligations to or motives of oonsnleratiou for this or any subsequent Administration, and authorized and em powered to examine into and make re|K>rt upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the executive depart ments of the Government. Their reports should be made to the Congress and to the Secretan* of the Treasury. I trust that the Congress will give its immediate con sideration to the problem of future taxation. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed indispensable service during the war. They must, however, be simplifi? d, not only to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expen.se. but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite. Taxes to Stand For Next Year. With reference to the details of the revenue law, the Secretary of the Treasury and the commissioner of internal' revenue will lay lie fore you for your consideration certain! amendments necessary or desirable in conneetion with the] administration of the law?recommendations which have my approval and support. It is of the utmost importance that in dealing with this matter the present law should not be disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendar year 1920, payable in the calendar year 19lM. The Congress might well consider whether the higher rates of income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of r<\ enue, and whether they may not, on tho contrary, be de structive of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in peace times high rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the incentive to new enterprise, encourage extravagant ex penditures, and produce industrial stagnation with conse quent unemployment, and ??iub -att?meant evils. The problem is not an easy one. A fundamental change has taken place with reference to the position of Amerita in the world's affairs. The prejudice and liassions engen dered by decades of controversy between two schools of political and economic thought?the one believers in pro tection of American industries, the other believers in tariff for revenue only?must be subordinated to the single con sideration of the public interest in the light of utterly changed conditions. Before the war America was heavily the debtor of the rest of the world, and the interest pay (Continue-d on Paffe Three Column One )
