THE TONOPAH DAILY BONANZA, TONOPAH, NEVADA, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1916 PAGE THREE PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE READ TO CONGRESS TODAY TEH CARDINALS Martin Cafferata Stare Pavlovich ARE MUTED VUUZLU KM tBy AwoeUte Pre..) WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President Wilson's address at the opening ses sion of congress today was wholly devoted to domestic subjects, princi pally the problem of railway legisla tion. In the hall of the house, with sena tors and representatives assembled In joint session, President Wilson, in accordance with the custom he began at the opening of his term, read his address from the clerk's desk. The president not only renewed his recommendation for legislation to prevent a nation wide railway jtrle or lockout before there has been opportunity for investigation, but defended it againHt the attack of organized labor as nothing arbitrary or unjust and the "justifiable safe guarding by society of the necessary processes of its very life." Aside from recommendations for the passage of the Porto Rico gov ernment bill, the corrupt practices bill and the Webb bill to lesallKe American collective selling agencies abroad, the president's address was devoted wholly to the railroad situa tion. The only feature which had not been forecast was the elimination of the proposal that congress give explicit approval to consideration by the Intei-state Commerce commission of an Increase in freight rates to meet additional expenditures by the railroads caused by the operation of the Adamson law. Interstate Commerce Today, the president took the posi tion that "the power of the Interstate Commerce commission to grant an increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is Indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the commission's authority or Its Inclina tion to do justice when there is no rauou to doubt either." The other recommendations on the railroad tlluatlon made In a special manage during the last session. which were not put into law, were renewed today. They Include: "Immediate provision for the en Itrgtment and' administrative reor gulutlon of the interstate Com merce commission along the lines embodied in the bill recently passed by the house of representatives and now awaiting action by the senate la order that the commission may be enabled to deal with the many area! end various duties now devolving upon It with a promptness and thor oughness which are, with its present constitution and means of action, practically impossible.

PRESIDENT W00DR0W WILSON. tratlon of such controversies as the present by adding to it a provision that, in case the methods of accom modation now provided for should fall, a full public investigation of the merits of every such dispute shall be Instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. "The lodgement in, the bands" of the executive of the power, in case of military necessity, to take control of such portions of such rolling stock of the railways of the country as may be required for military use and to operate them for military pur poses, with authority to draft Into the military service of the United States such train crews and adminis trative officials aa the circumstances may require for their safe and effi cient use." Compulsory Investigation The renewed recommendation for compulsory Investigation of labor dis- putes on railways before strikes or lockeuts are allowed, which has aroused the opposition of the railroad brotherhoods, and of the American Federation of Labor, was defended In the president's message. He de clared he would hesitate to recom mend a law which would force in dividual workmen to continue in an employment which they desired to leave, but that no such principle was Involved in the suggestion that the operation of the railways of the country should not be stopped by the concentrated action of bodies of men until ' a public investigation for the benefit of the public has been In stituted. Powers of Employes "It Ir based upon the very different principle," he continued, "that the concentrated action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the industrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the Satisfy! that's a new thing for a cigarette to do It'i nothing for a cigarette to just taste good lots of cigarettes may do that.

I can see nothing In that proposition but the justifiable safe guarding by society' of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbitrary or unjust in It unless it be arbitrarily and unjustly done. ' It can and should be done with a full and scrupulous regard for the interests and liberties of all con cerned, as well as for the permanent Interests of society itself." "At the last session of the congress a bill was passed by the senate which provides for the promotion of vocational and Industrial education, which is of vital importance to the whole country because It concerns a matter too ?ong neglected, upon which the thorough Industrial prep aration of the country for the critical years of economic development im mediately" ahead of us in very large measure depend. May I not urge its early and favorable consideration by the house of representatives and its early enactment into law? It con tains plans which affect all interests and all parts of the country, and I am sure there is no legislation now pending before the congress whose passage, the country awaits with more thoughtful approval or greater Impatience to see a great and ad mirable thing set In the way of being done.
