A "SQUARE DEAL ?OR ALL. '.."here are a great many people it this country, naturalized American who were natives of Mexico, Mexicans bxf'aw'aflJT rastdiato-this' country, i bat' who-liavtf not become" citizens'" of1) this country, and Americans who are well acquainted with the conditions and customs in Mexico, who do not hesitate to give i as their opinion that the Mexican uncials are making strenuous efforts to extradite Mexi cans from this country who have com mitted no crime in this country or in Mexico which would subject them to extraction under the treaty or the laws of either or both nations. It is no violation of the laws of this country for either a native, natural ized citizen or foreigner to criticize by speecn or writings in newspapers the government of the United States, the officials of our home government or the government or officials of any other nation on eartb, still we find the Mexican government seeking the ex tradition of a number of Mexican cit zens now on this side of the line who are known to bae been active in call ing attention by both public speech and through the medium of the news papers to the kind of government now existing in Mexico. In this work we find the officials or the federal govern ment of tbP United States .giving to the eMxican officials every possible assistance In the extradition of who ever Is desired or asked for. A number of Mexicans who were known to be identlsed with a rcvoli- tionary junta in Douglas were deport ed to Mexico under laws of the United States against a certain class of alien becoming citizens of this country. Notwithstanding the strenuous denial made there is reason to believe thai these men were xummarlly executed soon after the United States officials put them Into the hands of Mexican rurales across the border line at No gales. A number of Mexicans are now held at EI Paso on charges of crimes committed years ago in Mexico for which 1 Is proposed to extradite them from this country to a summary and arbitrary execution soon after they reach Mexican soil. t Perpcti'' thn cfctp of Texas refused to grant papers for the extradition of I several Mexicans from that state to Xexleo and immediately their cases n taken up by the Mexican govern meat with the nauonal government at Washington. In view of the almost universal be lief that the Mexicans who have tried to build np a revolutionary sentiment fat Mexle os this side of the Use will. when returned to that country, be areeaptly executed without trial bj Jde or Jery, It le the duty of the AaaerleM eAeJale and' courts .to exeN else the greatest caro In seeing that no obo is surrendered to Mexico whIK there Is say doubt of their guilt a crimes which subject them to tho treaty aBd extraction laws of the' two oeaatries.

Tbere is not an official in the sister republic who caiaict bo deposed at the will of the president; if this is not true then there is woeful Ignorance In this country of the conditions in Mexi co. A Mexican, a Russian, a German, a Frenchman or Japanese may curse his native land and its government in the United States without violating any law of this country. If he commits an overt act in preparation for Invading a foreign country he (s amendable to the las of this country, but for that he may not be deported Uf his native land for execution. As a rule It is pleasant for an American to listen to . ,., ... .o.i a foreigner denounce his native land and thus give implied praise of this land of tho free and home of the brave. A Mexican in this country who denounces the' Dla government com mits no crime anJ he should not be delivered to his everlasting doom until the most searching Investigation. Is made into the crimes charged against him. A free Amerlcau may openly de nounce Roosevelt and his administra tion with no one to hinder or make him afraid, but if a Mexican de nounces the government of Diaz he is liable to arrest on any old charge of murder and once extradited to Mex ico his days are at an end. We insist on tho "square deal" for the Mexican who has done no more than to call attention to the short comings of his native land. o In the district court yesterday there was another damage suit on trial wherein a couple of young men who had been arrested en a charge of steal Ing hay were suing those responsible for the charge for $5000 damages. WlthouJ desire to pass upon the mer its of this particular case we would suggest that damage suits in this county are taking up a great deal of tho time of the court and putting a great deal of Inconvenience and ex pense to defendants, as well as those who are called as witnesses. Damage suits should not be barred from the "courts, but we belh'e there should be a law enacted which would make the rarty bringing a suit for damage liable for all costs when the defendant is given a verdict, including attorney's fees and pay for k". loss of time In the defens- of the case, in other words the damse suits should always be loaded at both ends, so that the de fendant could hae damages against the plaintiff. Take the prerage news paper damage suit; to accuse an edi tor with libel should entitle him to the STne measure of damages as claimed by the person entering suit on ac count of some alleged false article printed In his paper. It such were the law there would be less damage suits In courts and much valuable time would be saved. TTCr 

PRESIDENT'S5 MESSAaO In today's p'aper wlli be" found'1 alft: eral amount of the president's message delivered to congress Tuesday morn ing. The document was so long that' its publication in one issue ot this paper was not possible. The entire message would nil about 35 columns of an ordinary newspaper. The presi dent devotes practically all of the message to domestic affairs. He deals with corporations, capital and labor, child and women labor, eight-hour law, injunctions, the right of the govern ment to appeal cases from inferior courts to the supreme court of the nation He takes occasion to warn the people that s failure to control the railroads of tho country will lead to what he regards as the undeilr.ible condition of government ownership of these great industries. He renews his recommendation for an inheritance tax and goe3 further and advocates the advisibility of an income tax. This latter recommenda tion is another step in taking up measures long advocated by the dem ocratic party and which has been one of the most prominent contentions of Mr. Bryan since his first nomination for president. o

This is as. No more scathing condemna-(no more necessarily true of the action Hon could be visited upon a law than'"' governments than of the action of is contained In the words of tho In- terstate Commerce Comml""lon when In commenting upon the fact fut the numerous Joint traffic associations do technically violate the law. they say: "The decision of tho United States Supreme Court In the Trans-Missouri case and the Joint Traffic Association case has produced no practical effect upon the railway operations of the country. Such associations, in fact, exist now as they dlj before these de cisions, and with the same general ef fect. In Justice to all parties, we ought probably to add that It is difficult to see how our Interstate rallwajn could be operated with due regard to the Interest of the shipper and the rail way without concerted action of the kind afforded thru these a"MOclatlons." This means that the law- as con strued by the Supreme Court Is such that the business of the country can not be conducted without breaking It. I recommend that you give careful and early consideration to this sub ject, and if you find the opinion of tho Interstate Commerce CommlIon Jus tified, that you amend the law so as to obviate the evil disclosed. Currency Reform. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business develop ment of the country: and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from J21.41 to 533.08. For several ears evidence has been accumulating that additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphaslzen the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, be cause to leave them as they are means to Incur liability of business disaster. Since jour body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the interest on 3iJJ'on,eroin-2" jpei-ieat,tb"jlo,pierj ,!., aw iuv uwcuion ar even greater during tho preceding six months. The Secretary of the Treas ury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation is the advance of commer cial rates and tho uncertainty felt In the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial interests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call money in New- York at tract money from the interior banks into the speculative field; this depletes the fund that would otherwise be available for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced to pay abnormal rates: so that each fall a tax. In the shape of Increased ln- terest.charges. Is placed on the whole commerce of the country. The mere statement of these facts shows that our present sistem Is serl. ously defective. There Is need of a :hange. Unfortunatelv. however, many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they aro complicated, and not easy of compre hension and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan which would mate rially Impair the value of the United States 2 per cent bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the Issue of which was made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the Treasury. 1 do not press any especial plan. Vari ous plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that re peatedly brought to your attention by the present Secretary of the Treas ury, the essential features of which have been approved by many prom inent bankers and business men. Ac cording to this plan national banks should be permitted to Issue a speci fied proportion of their capital la notes of a given kind, the Issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive notes back when not wantej in legiti mate trade. This plan would not per mit tho issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet thee emergency presented by times of stringency. I do not say that, this is the right system. I only advance it to empha size my belief that there Is need for the adoption of some system which shall be automatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid all possi bility of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan would tend to prevent the spasms of high money and specula tion which now obtain in the New York market: for at present there Is too much currency at certain seasons of the year, and Its accumulation at New York tempts bankers to lead it at low rates for speculative purposes: where as at other times when the crops, are being moved there ts arg ent need for a tanre eat temporary Increase In the curency supply. It most never be forgotten that thif qaesUon concerns business men gener ally quite as much as bankers: eape cteHy'ia, this tree of stockmen, farm ers, and haainess men In the West: for ct present at certain ceesene of tn year the difference In Interest rates be tutsen the east and the west Is from $ to 10 per cent, whereas In Canada tho corresponding difference Is but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of course, guard the Interests of western and southern bankers as carefully as It guards the Interests of New York or Chicago bankers; and must be drawn from the standpoint of the fanner and the merchant no less than from the standpoints of the city banker and the country banker. The law should be amended so as; specifically to provide that the funds derived from customs duties may be treated by the Secretary of the Treas ury as he treats funds obtained under the Internal-revenue laws. There should be a considerable increase In bills of small denominations. Permis sion should be given banks, if neces sary under settled restrictions, to re tire circulation to a larger amount than three millions a month. International Morality. It Is a mistake, and it betravs n spirit of foolish cynicism, to maintain that all International governmental action is. ana must ever De, Dasea up n mere selfishness, and that to ad- individuals. lt Is a true sign of a base nature alnavs to ascribe base motives, for the actions of others. Un questionably no nation can afford to disregard proper considerations of self-interest, any more than a private individual can so do. But It is equally true that the average Individual in any really decent community does many actions with reference to other men In which he is guided, not by self-interest, but by public spirit, by regard for the rights of others, by a disin terested purpose to do good to others, and to raise the tone ot the commun ity as a whole. Similarly, a really great nation must often act. and as a matter of fact often does act, toward other nations In a spirit not in the least mere self-interest, but paying heed chiefly to ethical reasons; and as the centuries go by this disinterest edness in International action, this tendency of the individuals comprlz Insr a nation to require that nation to act with Justice toward Its neighbors, steadily grows and strengthens- It Is neither wise nor right for a nation to disregard its own needs, -nd it is foolish and may be wicked to think that other nations will disregard theirs. But it Is wicked for a nation only to regard its own interest, and foolish to believe that such is the sole motive that actuates any other nation. It should be our steady aim to raise the ethical standard of na tional action Just as we strive to raise the ethical standard of Individual ac tion. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with Justice and good will all immigrants who come here under tho law. Whether they are Catholic or Protestant, Jew or Gentile; whether they come from England or Germany, Russia, Japan, or Italy, matters nothing.. All we have a right to question Is the man's con-du.t- , Jf &e .1? honest, .and upright .in jKU dealings with1 bl" neighbor and with the State, then he is entitled to respect nnd good treatment. Especial ly do we need to reiscmber our duty to the stranger within our gates. It Is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discrimin ate against or in any way humiliate such stranger who has come here law fully and who is conducting himself nroperly. To remember this Is In mimbent on every American citizen, and it is of course peculiarly Incum bent on every Government official, whether of the nation or of the sev eral States. I am prompted to say this byline at titude of hostility here and there as sumed toward the Japanese in this country. This hostility is sporadicj ana is limited to a very rew- places. Nevertheless, It Is most discreditable to us as a people, and It may be fraught with the gravest consequences to the nation. The friendship be tween the United States and Japan has been continuous since the time, over helf a century ago, when Com i odore Perry, by his expedition to Japan, first opened tho islands to western civilization. Since then the growth of Japan has been literally as tounding. There Is not only nothing to parallel It, but nothing to , ap proach It In the history of civilized mankind, Japan has a glorious and ancient past. Her civilization is old er than that of thenatlons of north ern Europe the nations from whom the people of the United States have chiefly sprung. But fifty years ago Japan's development was still that of the Middle Ages. During that fifty years the progress of the country Ini every walk in life has been a marvel to mankind, and she now stands as one of the greatest of civilized na tlons; great In the arts of war and in the arts ot peace; great In military. in industrial, in artistic development and achievement. Japanese soldiers and sailors have shown themselves equal In combat to any of whom his tory makes note. She has produced great generals and mighty admirals; her fighting men. afloat and ashore, show all the heroic courage, the un questioning, unfaltering loyalty, the splendid indifference to hardship and death, which marked the Loyal Ron ins; and they show also that they possess the highest" ideal of patriot ism. Japanese artists of every kind see their products eagerly sought for in all lands. The Industrial and com mercial development of Japan has been phenomenal; greater than that of any other country during the same period. At the same time the advance In science and philosophy Is no Teas marked. The admirable management of the Japanese Red Cross during the late war, the efficiency and humanity of the Japanese officials, nurses and doctors, won the respectful admiration of all acquainted with the facts. Through the Red Cross the Japanese people sent over $100,000 to the suf firs of Ran Frwieisi'o. end the gi't was aeeeptea wtth gratitude by oar people.

A. Schwartz, Ass't Cashier. We Have Unequaled Facilities for Care & to Japan. In return. Japanese have come here in great numbers. They are welcome, socially and intellectual ly, in all our colleges and Institutions of higher learning. In all our profes sional nnd social bodies. The Japan ese have won in a single generation the right to stand abreast of the fore-: most and most enlightened peoples of Europa and America; they have won on their own merits and by their own exertions 'the right to treatment on a basis of full and frank equality. The overwhelming mass of our people cherish a lively regard and respect for' the people of Japan, and In almost every qifarter of the Union the Strang-' er from Japan is treated as he de serves; that is, he. Is treated as the stranger from any part of civilized Europe Is and deserves to be treated. But here and there a most unworthy feeling has manifested Itself toward the Japanese the feeling that has been shown In shutting them out from the common schools In San Francisco, and In mutterings against them In one or two other places, because of, their effilcency as workers. To shut them out from the public schools is a wicked absurdity, when there are no first-class colleges in the land, in I eluding the universities and college i of California, which do not gladlj ' welcome Japanese students and on which Japanese students do not re flect credit. We have as much to learn from Japan as Japan has to . 'earn from us: and no nation Is fit to teach unless It Is also willing to learn. Throughout Japan Americans are well treated, and any failure on the part of Americans at home to treat the Jap anese with a like courtesy and con sideration is by Just so much a con fession of Inferiority in our civiliza tion. Our nation fronts on tho Pacific, just as It fronts on tho Atlantic. We hope to play a constantly growing part in the great ocean of the Orient. We wish, as we ought to wish, for a great commercial development In our dealings with Asia; and it is out of the question that we should perman ently have such development unless we freely and gladly extend to other nations the same measure of justice jand cood .treatment which we expect to' receive' in" return.' It. is) only atj very small body at." our' cttlzen that W act badly. Where the Fedreal govern ment has power it wilt deal summar ily with any such. Where the several states have power I earnestly ask that they also deal wisely and promptly with such conduct, or else this small body of wrongdoers may bring shame upon the great mass, of the Innocent -leht-thlnklng fellows that Is. upon our nation as a whole. Good manners should be an International no less than an Individual attribute. I ask fair treatment for the Japanese as I would "k fair treatment for Germans or Englishmen, Frenchmen, Russians, or Italians. I ask it as due to humanity and civilization I ask It as due to ourselves because we must act up rightly toward all men. I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provid ing for the naturalization of Jananese who come hero intending to become American citizens. One of the great embarrassments attending the per formance of our international obliga tions Is the fact that the statutes of the United States are entirely Inade aunte. They fall to give to the nation al government sufficiently ample pow r, throueh United States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earn "stlv recommend that the criminal .and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and added to as to en able the president, acting for the Unit ed States government, which Is re sponsible in our international rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties. Even as the law now Is something can be done by the fed eral government toward this end, and In the matter now before me affect ing the Japanese, everything that it is In my power to Jo will be done, and all o the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may law. fully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the nation al government completely to perform and enforce Its own obligations to other nations. The mob ot a single city may at any time perform acts of fawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us tuiu war. inai cuy u iucil muuiu be powerless to make defense against! the foreign power thus assaulted, and If Independent of this government it would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offend ing city or the offending community lies in the hands of the United States government. It Is unthinkable that we should continue a policy, under which a given localltv mav be allow- to commit rrtm nln a friend ly nation, and the United States gov ernment limited, nnt In nreventlngm" last resort, to defending the people I who have cotnmlttM' It lnrt thoJThen Remembers us for "The Only "neaunrs of tMi" own wrnrlo- In.
