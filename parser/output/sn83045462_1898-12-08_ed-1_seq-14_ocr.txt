ATTACK ON MANZANILLO L- or the Last Operations in the West Indies Disappointment on Heoeh inK Notice Anunil l.*t of th?? SigiiinK of I he IViht Protocol. The war t orrespondence now being pre pared for publication by the navigation bureau of 'he Navy Department includes an Interesting leport made by Captain C. F. Goodrich of the operations of the cruiser Newark. from which it appears that that vessel fired the last shot of the war, so far :.s the operations in the West Indies are concerned. Thi? report is dated off Man zanillo. Cuba. August IS, 1?>8, and gives an account of the operations of that vessel and hor consorts up to that time. The Newark left Guantanamo August*.?. and. in company with the cruiser Resolute, carrying the bat talion of marines, under Colonel Hunting ton, proceeded to the westward of San tiago de Cuba, whef they fell in with the Hist and Suwanee, off Cape Cruz. It was then learned that the condition of affairs at Manzanillo was such as to warrant the beiief that an attack in force would re sult in the speed}' capitulation of the gar rison and city. Captain Goodrich says that the fleet, then consisting of th?- following vessels, Newark, Resolute. Suwanee. Hist, Osceola and Al varado. 1* ft Cape Cruz on the morning of August 11 for Cuatro Realts channel, the Hist with her pilot going ahead in order to minimize the chances of accident in navigating waters only imperfectly charted. The other vessels followed close aboard, all keeping the lead going constantly. By a preconcerted system of signals the pres ence of shoal wattr or other danger could in this w.iy l?e Instantly communicated fr>-m the leading ships in ample time to stop the progress ??f the heavy draught ships Resolute and Newark. No difficulty w. s experi' need in getting through Cuatro R-al > channel, and at dark of ihat day the fleet anchored inside of the Great Uar rier rt-ef. in ten fathoms of water, about forty miles distant from Manzanillo. lloni hardineut ol M:i n r.s\ n i iio. The report then continues a? follows: "f>n the morning of the li'th instant my little flotilla got under way at V.:W? and pro ceeded to th^ vicinity of Manzanillo. The Resolute. Suwanee. Hist and Osceola an chored well inside of the northern entrance. I hoisted a flag ?>f truce on the Newark and proceeded to an anchorage about three miles distant fr??m the town, whence 1 sent the Alvarado. also bearing a flag of truce, to present to the military commandant a de mand for surrender. This demand was placed in his hands by Lieutenant Blue. The reply was to the effect that the Span ish military code forbade a surrender ex cept as the sequence of a siege or other military operation. ?The town being fortified is exempt from the privileges and immunities attached to defenseless places. Nevertheless, as you will perceive from my demand, sufficient time was given to permit non-combatants to leave the city. At o'clock f signaled to the outlying vessels to take the sta tions off the town which had been assign ed, and at hauled down the (lag of truce on the Newark and proceeded to ward Manzanillo until the shoalness of the wat? r forbade her further approach. At M.io fire was opened from this ship on the batteries, anil was maintained with tolerable steadiness until 4:15 o'clock, with an aecuraey surprising in view ??f the short tim .luring which she had b.-en eoinmis sioned, the other vessels following shortly after.

March Through Snoilasro Vnder Arms and InvHile Spanish Club. A dispatch from Santiago de Cuba yes terday says: Today is the anniversary of the death of Gen. Antonio Maceo and has been celebrated among the Cubans in San tiago. A memorial service was held this morning: in the cathedral, which was crowd ed Less than two years ago the same ca thedral witnessed a Te Deum, sung by the same choir, in celebration of Maceo's death. Then the cathedral was draped with Span ish colors. Today the entire edifice was In black. Interspersed with a few Cuban em blems. Considerable annoyance was occasioned to the United States authorities by the fact that some seventy-five men. Cubans, march ed the entire length of St. Thomas street. *"~<1 w1th nifies and machetes, although all Cubans are well aware that such con duct is strictly against the regulations, armed bodies other than United States troops not being allowed. A band of Cubans on horseback entered the premises of the Spanish Club here this evening and broke several lamps with their machetes. The United States author ities acted promptly. As a result of the outrage at least half the police force will be discharged. OPPOSED TO DALY AWD RE1D. York Bfpuliltcnn Organization Will Xot Fight. However. From the New York Herald, Today. Senator Piatt and the republican organi zation will not quarrel with President Mc Kinley if he appoints Whitelaw Keid am bassador to Great Britain. They will not attack Colonel Roosevelt even if he nomi nates Judge Daly to succeed Judge O'Brien on the supreme court bench. They are opposing Mr. Keid because Sen ator Piatt regards him as a personal enemy, and Judge Paly because he is a democrat, and : hey believe a republican governor should bestow office only upon republicans. They disapprove the appointment of Major Avery r>. Andrews as adjutant general for the .same reason. t olcnei Roosevelt will be a republican governor, and I think it is the dutv of every republican to back up what he does," said Chaii man Odell of the. republican state committee yesterday. "I may differ from him personally, but whatever he decides is for the good of the people I shall abide by. We are all deter m ned to act in harmony. If I were a re publican governor 1 would not choose any democrat for office, no matter how good he might i>e. when I could find a republican competent to fill that office." When Odell and Piatt meet Colonel Roose velt tomorrow they will try to persuade him to select Judge Cohen Instead of Judge Daly. They will point out that Daly was nominated by the republicans to help Coihen and that if Cohen had not been running no fight would have been made for Daly. If Colonel Roosevelt remains firm Piatt and Odell will submit. 

SPANISH \IEW OF THE MESSAOE. Indignation at Kefercncen to Dr ?truetlon of the Maine. LONDON, December 8.-The Madrid cor respondent of the Standard, who contrasts the indifference of the majority of Span iards to the President's message with the anxiety regarding his declarations fore- ' shadowing war, says: "Only ,n political and official circles is any interest in the message displayed, and th're it takes the form of bitterness and indignation at Mr. McKinley's allusion to the destruction of the Maine. "The press d..es not hide its satisfaction at the indications in the message and else where that American colonizing will be fraught with difficulties and expenditure. The prediction is made that the Nicaragua canal will lead to trouble between the United States and Europe."
