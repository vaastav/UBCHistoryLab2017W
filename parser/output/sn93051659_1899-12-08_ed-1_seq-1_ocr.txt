CONDITION OP THE COUNTRY. 1 Prosperity at Home and Peace With All Governments. The 66th congress convenes In its first regular session with the country in a condition of unusual prosperity, of uni versal good-will among the people at home and relations of peace and friend ship with every government of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great increase In volume and value. The com'. V. . 1 . . .. m 1 1 uiueu imports ana expurus iur me yea are the largest ever shown by a eingle year In all our history. Our exports for 1899 alone exceeded by more than $1,000, 000,000 our imports and exports combined In 1870. The imports per capita are 20 per cent less than in 1870, while the exports per capita are 68 per cent more than in 1870, showing the enlarged capacity of the United States to satisfy the wants of its own increasing population, as well as to contribute to those of the peoples of other nations. Exports of agricultural products were 1784,776.142. Of manufactured prod ucts wo exported in value (339,592,146, be ing larger than any previous year. . It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products of our manufactures sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1898 and 1899. . " FINANCES OF THE NATIOH. - Receipts and Disbursements for tbe . Lut Fiscal Year. Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, includ ing $11,798,314 14. part payment of the Cen tral Pacific indebtedness, aggregated $810, 982,004 S5. Of this sum, customs receipts were $206,128,481 75, and those, from inter nal revenue $273,437,161 SL For the fiscal Jrear the expenditures were $700,093,564 02, 'leaving a deficit of $89,111,559 67. . The secretary of the treasury estimates that the receipts for the current - fiscal year will aggregate $640,958,112. and upon the basis of present appropriations the ex penditures will aggregate $600,958,112, leav ing $40,000,000. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1899, the Internal revenue receipts were Increased about $100,000,000. THE 

GOLD STANDARD. A Fitting- Time to Make Provision for Its Continuance. I urgently recommend that, to support the existing gold standard and to main tain the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and silver) and the equal power of every dollar at all times In the market and In the payment of debts, the secretary of the treasury be given additional power and charged wtth the duty to sell United States bonds and to employ such other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. The au thority should Include the power to sell bonds on long and short time, as condi tions may require, and should provide for a rate of interest lower than that fixed by the act of January 14, 1875. While there is now no commercial fright which withdraws gold from . the government, but, on ' the contrary, such widespread confidence that gold seeks the treasury, demanding paper money in exchange, yet the very situation points to the present as the most fitting time to make adequate provision to insure the continuance of the gold standard and of public confidence In the ability and purpose of the govern ment to meet all Its obligations in the money, which the civilized world recog nizes as the best. ' . . OUR 

MERCHANT MARINE. Industrial Greatness Should Be Sup plemented by Sea Progress. The value of an American merchant ma rine to the extension of our commerc at trade and the strengthening of our power upon the sea Invites the immediate acilon of congress. Our national development will be one-sided and unsatisfactory so long as the remarkable growth of our in land Industries remains unaccompanied by progress on the sea. There is no lack of vconstitutional authority for legisla ion which shall give to the country maritime strength commensurate with its Indus trial achievements and with its rank among nations of the earth. The past year has recorded exceptional activity in our shipyards, and the promises of con tinual prosperity in shipbuilding are abun dant. Advanced legislation for the protec tion of our seamen has been enacted. Our coast trade, under regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the govern ment and since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequaled in our records or those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our opportunities, however, , If we complacently regard only matters at bome and blind ourselves to the necessity of securing our share in the valuable car rying trade of the world. - Last year American vessels transported a smaller share of our exports and imports than during any former year in all our history, and the measure of our depend ence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to our people. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the .departments of the government charged -with military and naval operations In the ;Eat and in the West Indies had to ob tain from foreign flags merchant vessels essential for these operations. PROBLEM OF THE TRUSTS. Heed of Early Amendment of tbe Ex isting; Law. , Combinations of capital, organized Into trusts to control the - conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production, and determine the prices of products consumed by the people, are provoking public discussion and should ' early claim the attention of congress. The Industrial commission created by the act of congress of June 18, 1S98, has been engaged In extended hearings upon the deputed questions involved In the subject of combinations in re straint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed the Investigation of this subject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may ar rive are undetermined. The subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and variety or cause and ex--.tent of the injuries to the public which may arise from large combinations, con centrating more or less numerous enter prises and establishments, which previous 'to the formation of the combination were .carried on. separately. It Is universally , conceded that combinations which engross or control the market of any particular ;klnd of merchandise or commodity neces aarjr to tbe general community by sup cjwvuing natural and ordinary competi- tion, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law, but also to the public welfare. There must be a remi edy for the evils Involved in such organ izations. If the present law can be ex tended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay. Whatever power the congress possesses over this most Imports ant subject should be promptly ascer tained and asserted. ; - 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. No Dispute of Serious Character With Any Government. A review of our relations with foreign states is presented, wtth . such recom mendations as are deemed appropriate. - In my last annual message I adverted to the claim of the Austro-.riungar.an government for indemnity for the killing of certain Austrian and Hungarian sub jects by the authorities of the state of Pennsylvania, at Lattlmer, while sup pressing an unlawful tumult of miners, September. 10, 1897. In view of the verdict of acquittal rendered by the court before which the sheriff and his deputies were tried for murder, and following the estab lished doctrine that the government may not be held accountable for injuries suf fered by individuals at the hands of the public authorities while acting in .the line of duty in suppressing disturbances of the public peace, this government, after due consideration of the claim advanced by the Austro-Hungar:an government, was constrained to decline liability to indem nify the sufferers. " It is gratifying to be able to announce that the Belgian government has mitigated the restrictions on the importation of cattle from the United States, to which I referred in my last annual message. NICARAGUA CANAL. Status of tbe Negotiations for tbe Inter-Ocean Waterway. Tbe contract of the Maritime Canal Company, of Nicaragua, was ' declared forfeited by ' the Nicaragua government on the 10th of October, on .the ground of nonfulfillment within the 10-year term stipulated in the contract. The Maritime Canal Company has lodged a protest against this action, alleging rights in the premises which appear worthy of con sideration. This government expects that Nicaragua will afford the protestants a full and fair hearing upon the merits of the case. The Nicaragua canal commission, which has been engaged upon the work of examination and survey of a ship canal route across Nicaragua, having completed its labors and made its report, was dis solved on May 21, and on June 10 a new commission, known as the. Isthmian canal commission, was organized under the terms of the act approved March 3, -1899, for the -purpose of examining the American isthmus with a view to deter mining the most practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across that isth mus, with Its probable cost and other essential details. This commission, un der the presidency of Rear-Admiral John G. Walker, United States navy (retired), entered promptly upon the work intrusted to It, and is now carrying on examina tions In Nicaragua along the route of the Panama canal, and in Darien from tbe Atlantic in, the neighborhood of the Artric river to the bay of Panama, on the Pa cific side. Good progress has been made, but under the law a comprehensive and complete investigation Is called for, which will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplishment. The work will be . prosecuted as expeditiously as possible,' and a report may be expected at the earliest practicable date. The great importance of this work can not be too often or too strongly pressed upon the attention of the congress. In my message of a year ago I expressed my views of the necessity of a canal which would link the two great oceans, to which I again invite your consideration. The reasons then presented for early action are even stronger now. 

GREAT BRITAIN AND CANADA. Alaska Boundary Contention and Other Unsettled Questions. In my last annual message, I referred to the pending negotiations with Great Brit ain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. By means of an executive agreement, a joint high commission had been created for the purpose of adjusting all unsettled questions between the United States and Canada, embracing 12 subjects, among which were the questions of the fur seals, the fisheries of the coast and contiguous inland waters, the Alaska boundary, the transit of merchandise in bond, the alien labor laws, mining rights, reciprocity In trade, revision of the agreement respect ing naval vessels in the Great Lakes, a more complete marking of parts of tbe boundary, provision for the conveyance of criminals, and for wrecking and salvage. Much progress had been made by the commission toward the adjustment of many of these questions, when it became apparent that an irreconcilable difference of views was entertained respecting the delimitation of the Alaska boundary. In the failure of an agreement -to the mean ing of articles ill and iv of The treaty of 1825 between Russia' and Great Britain, which defined the boundary between Alas ka and Canada, the American commission ers proposed that the subject - of . tbe boundary be laid aside, and that the' re maining questions of difference be pro ceeded with, some of which were so far advanced as to assure the probability of a settlement. This being declined by the British commissioners, an adjournment was taken until the boundary should be adjusted by the two governments. The subject has been receiving the careful at tention which its Importance demands, with the result that a modus Vivendi for provisional demarkatlons in the region about the head of Lynn canal has been agreed upon, and It is hoped that the negotiations now in progress between the two governments will end in an agree ment for the establishment and dellmlta-' tlon of a permanent boundary. . Attitude in Anglo-Boer War. Apart from these questions growing out of our relationshin with our northern ,' neighbor, the most friendly disposition ana ready agreement have marked the discussion of the numerous matters aris ing in the vast and intimate Intercourse of the United States with Great Britain. This government has maintained an atti tude of neutrality In the unfortunate con test between Great Britain .and the Boer states of Africa. We have remained faithful to the precept of : avoiding en tangling alliances as to affairs not of our own direct concern. Had circumstances suggested that the parties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kind expression of the hope of the American people that the war might be averted, good offices would have been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria was early instructed to see that all neutral I American Interests be respected by the 1 combatants. This has been an easy task, j in view of the positive declarations of both British and Boer authorities that the personal and property rights of our citi zens should be observed. Upon the' withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria, the United States consul was authorized, upon the request of . the British government, and with the assent of the South African and Orange Free State governments, to exercise the customary good offices of a neutral for the care of British Interests. In the dis charge of this function I am happy to say that abundant opportunity has been af forded to show the impartiality of this government to both the combatants for the fourth time in the present decade. THE 

WEST INDIES. Pacification and Government of Cuba Pronrress Made. : My annual message of last year was necessarily devoted in great part to a consideration of the Spanish war, the re-; suits it wrought, and the conditions it im posed for the future. I am gratified to announce that the treaty of peace has re stored friendly relations between the two powers. Effect has been given to its most important provisions. The evacuation of Puerto Rico having already been accom plished on the 18th of October, 1898, noth ing remained necessary there but to con tinue the provisional military control of the island until the congress should enact a suitable government for the ceded terri tory. Of the character and scoie of the I measures to that end I shall treat In an other part of this message. The withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba was effected by the 1st of January, so that the full re-establishment of peace found the relinquished territory, held by us in trust for the in habitants, maintaining under the direction of the executive such government and con trol therein as should conserve public or der, restore the productive conditions of peace, long disturbed by the instability and disorder which prevailed for the greater part of the preceding three' decades, .and build up that tranquil development of the domestic state whereby alone can -be re alized the high purpose, as proclaimed in the joint resolution adopted by the congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by which the United States disclaimed any disposi tion or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control over Cuba, except for the pacification thereof, and asserted Its determination when that was accom plished to leave the government and con trol of the island to its people. The pledge contained in this resolution is of the highest honorable obligation and must be sacredly kept. I believe that substantial progress has been made in this direction. All the ad ministrative measures adopted in Cuba have aimed to fit it for a regenerated ex istence by enforcing the supremacy of law J I , l 1 1. I n.o,tl t CLUU JUBUUCi ujr pitting W J1C1 c si w t. v-1- cable the machinery of administration In the hands ef the inhabitants; by Institut ing needed sanitary reforms, by spreading education, by fostering industry and trade, by Inculcating public morality, and in short taking every rational step to old the Cuban people to attain to that plane of self-conscious respect and self-reliant unity which fits an enlightened community for self-government, within Its own sphere, while enabling It to fulfill all outward obligations. ..'''," Obligations to Cuba. Must Be Kept. This nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the fu ture good government of Cuba. We have accepted a trust, the fulfillment of which calls for the sternest Integrity of purpose and the exercise of the highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past must needs be bound to us by ties of singular Intimacy and strength. If its enduring welfare is to be assured. Whether these ties shall be organic or con ventional, - the destinies of Cuba are In some rightful . form and manner irre vocably linked with our own, but how and how far is for the future to determine in the ripeness of events. Whatever be the outcome, we must see to it that free Cuba be a reality, not'a name; a perfect entity, not a hasty experiment bearing within Itself the elements of failure. Our mis sion, to accomplish which we took up the gage of battle. Is not to be fulfilled by turning adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face the vicissitudes which too often attend weak er states;- whose natural wealth and abun dant resources are offset by, the incongrui ties of their political organization and the recurring occasions for Internal rivalries to sap their strength and dissipate their en ergies. The greatest blessing which can come to Cuba Is the restoration of her ag ricultural and industrial prosperity, which will give employment to idle men and re-establish the pursuits of peace. This Is her chief and immediate need. On the 19th of last August an order was made for the taking of the census In the island, to be completed on the 30th of November. : THE PHILIPPINE! QUESTION. Acquisition of the Islands The Fili pino Insurrection. On the 10th of December, 1898, the treaty of peace between the United States snd Spain was signed. It provided, among other things, that Spain should cede to tbe United States the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands, that the United States should pay to Spain the sum of $20, 000,000, and that the civil rights and podti cal - status of the native inhabitants of the' territories thus ceded to the United States should be determined by the con gress. The treaty was ratified by the en at ori:the 6th of February, 1898, and by the government of Spain on the 19th cf March following. The ratifications were exchanged on the 11th of April, and the treaty publicly proclaimed. On the id of March, the congress voted the sum con templated by the treaty, and the amount was paid over to the Spanish government on' the 1st of May. In this manner the Philippines came to the United States. The Islands were ceded by the government of Spain, which had "been in undisputed pos session of them for centuries. They were accepted not merely by our authorized commissioners In Paris, under the direction of the executive, but by the constitutional and well-considered action of the repre sentatives of tbe people of the United States In both bouses of congress. ' I had every reason to believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of sovereignty was . In accordance with the wishes and the aspirations of the great mass of the Filipino people. From the earliest moment no opportunity was lost of assuring the people of the islands of our ardent desire for their welfare and of the Intention of this government to do everything' possible to advance their Interests. In my order of the 19th of May, 1898, the commander of the military expedition dispatched to the Philippines was instructed to declare that we came not to make war on the people of the country, "nor upon any part or faction among them, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments and In their personal and religious rights." That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority there, on the l'th of August, It was directed that "there must be no joint occupation with the in surgents"; that the United States must preserve the peace and protect persons and property within the territory occu pied by their military and naval forces; that the Insurgents and all others must recognize the military occupation and au thority of the United States. As early as December 4, before the cession and in an ticipation of that event, the commander in Manila was urged to . restore peace and tranquility, and to undertake the estab lishment of a beneficient government, , which should afford the fullest security for life and property, i On the 21st of December, after the treaty was signed, the commander of the forces of occupation was Instructed "to announce and proclaim, In the most public manner, that we come, not as Invaders and con querors, but as friends to protect the na tives in their homes, In their employments and in their personal and religious rights." The same day, while ordering General Otis to see that peace should be preserved in Ilo Ilo, he was admonished that: "It is most Important that there should be no conflict with the insurgents." OA the first day of January, 1899, general orders reiterated that the kindly inten tions of this government should In every possible way, be communicated to the insurgents. The Philippine Commission. On the 21st of January, I announced my intention of dispatching to Manila a com mission composed of three gentlemen of the highest character and distinction, thoroughly acquainted with the Orient, whoV in association with Admiral Dewey and Major-General Otis, were instructed to "facilitate the nest humane and ef fective ends and to secure, with the least possible delay, the benefits of a wise and generous protection of life and proeprty to the inhabitants." These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob Gould Schurmaa, president of Cornell university: the Hon. Charles Den by, for many years minister to China, and Professor Dean C. Worcester, of the university of Michigan, who had made a most careful study of life in the Phil ippines. While the treaty of peace was under consideration In the senate, these commis sioners set out on their mission of good will and liberation. Their character was a sufficient guaranty of the beneficient pur with which they went, even if they had not borne the positive Instructions of this government which made their errand pre-eminently one of peace and friendship. But before their arrival in Manila, the s'nlster ambition of. a few leaders of the Filipinos had created a situation full of embarrassments for us and most grievom in Its consequences to themselves. The clear and Impartial preliminary re port of the convrilssioners, which I trans mit herewith, gives so lucid and compre hensive a history of the present Insurrec tionary movement that the story need not be here repeated. It is enough to say that the claim of the rebel leader, that he was promised Independence by any officer of the United States In return for his assistance has no foundation In fact, and Is categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove It. The most the Insurgent leader hoped for when he came back to Manila was the liberation of the Islands from the Spanish control, which they had been laboring for years, without success, to throw off. Outbreak of the Insurrection. . The prompt . accomplishment of this work by the American army and navy gave him other ideas and ambitions, and Insidious suggestions from various quar ters perverted the purposes and Intentions with which he had-taken up arms. No sooner had our army captured Manila than the Filipino forces' began to assume an attitude of suspicion and hostility, which the utmost efforts of our - officers and troops were unable to disarm or modify. Their kindness and forbearance was taken a3 a proof of cowardice. The aggression of the Filipinos continually Increased, un til, finally; Just before the time set for the senate of the United States to vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently prepared in advance, was made all along the American lines, which resulted in a terri bly destructive and sanguinary repulse of the insurgents. Ten days later an order of the Insurgent government was issued to its adherents who had remained in Manila, of which General Otis Justly observes that "for barbarous Intent It Is unequaled in mod ern times." It directs that at 8 o'clock on the night of the 14th of February, the territorial militia shall come together In tbe streets of San Pedro, armed with their bolos, with guns and ammunition where convenient: that Filipino families only shall be (respected; that all other individuals, of whatever race they may be. shall bo exterminated without any eomppfsion. after the extermination of the army of occupation, and- adds: "Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on. the Americans and exterminate them, that we may take our revenge for the infamies and treacheries which they have committed upon us. Have no compassion upon them: attack with vigor." v A copy of this fell, by good fortune, into the hands of our officers, and they were able to take measures to control, the rising, which was actually attempted on the night of February 22. a week later than was originally contemplated. A con siderable number of armed insurgents en tered the city by waterways and swamps, and. in concert with confederates inside, attempted to destroy Manila by fire. They wore kept in check during the night, and the next day driven out of the city, with heavy loss. - v - What the Commission Found. This was the. unhappy condition of af fairs which confronted our commissioners on their arrival In Manila. They had come with the hope and Intention of co operation with Admiral Dewey and Major-General Otis In establishing peace and order in the archipelago, and the largest measure of self-government compatible with the true welfare of the people. What they actually found can best be set forth In their own words: "Deplorable as war is, "the one In which we are now 'engaged was unavoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold,, adven turous and enthusiastic army. No alter native was left us, except Ignominious retreat. It Is not to be conceived of that any American would have sanctioned the surrender of Manila to the insurgents. Our obligations to other nations and to the friendly Filipinos and to ourselves and our flag demanded that force should be met with force. i.Whatever the future of the Philippines may be, there is no course open to us now except the prosecution of the war until the insurgents are reduced to submission. The commission Is of the opinion that there has been no time since the destruction of the Spanish squadron by Admiral Dewey when It was possible to withdraw our forces' from the islands either with honor to ourselves or with safety to the inhabitants." The course ;.thus clearly Indicated has been unflinchingly pursued. The rebel lion must be put, down. Civil government cannot be thoroughly established until order is restored. With a devotion and gallantry worthy of its most brilliant . history, the army, ably and loyally as sisted by the navy, has carried on this un welcome but most righteous campaign with richly deserved success. . The noble self-sacrifice with which our soldiers and sailors, whose terms of service had ex pired, refused to avail themselves of their right to return home as long as they were needed at the front, forms one of the brightest pages Jn our annals. Although their operations have been somewhat inl terrupted and checked by a rainy season of unusual violence and duration, they have gained ground steadily in every di rection, and now look forward confidently to a speedy completion of their task. The unfavorable - circumstances con nected with an active campaign have not been permitted, to interfere With the equally important work of reconstruc tion. Again I Invite your attention to the report of the commissioners for the Inter esting and-encouraging details of the work already accomplished In . the es tablishment of peace and order , and the inauguration of self-governing municipal life in many portions of the archipelago. Civil Government - in , Negros. A notable beginning has been made In the establishment of a government In the island of Negros, which is deserving of special consideration. This was the first island to accept American sovereign ty. Its -people unreservedly proclaimed allegiance to- the United States, and adopted a constitution looking to the es tablishment of a popular government. . It was impossible to guarantee to the peo ple of Negros. that - the constitution so adopted should be the - ultimate form of government. Such a question, under the treaty with Spain and in accordance with our own constitution and laws, came ex clusively under the jurisdiction of con gress. - The: government actually set up by the Inhabitants of Negros eventually proved unsatisfactory to the natives them selves. A new system Was put Into force by order of the major-general command ing the -department, of which . the; tol lowing are the most Important elements: It was ordered that the government of the Island of Negros should consist of a military governor, appointed by the United States military governor of the Philippines, and a civil governor and an advisory .council elected by the people. The military governor was authorized to ap point secretaries of the treasury, interior, agriculture, public instruction, an attorney-general and an auditor. The seat of government was fixed at Bacolor. The military governor exercises the supreme executive power. He is. to see that the laws are executed, appoint to offices and fill all vacancies In office not otherwise provided for, and may, with the approval of the military governor of the Philip pines, remove any officer from office. The civil governor advises the military gov ernor on all public and civil questions, and presides over the advisory council. He, in general, performs the duties which are performed by secretaries of state In our own system of government. The" ad-: visory council consists of eight members elected by the people within territorial limits, which are defined in the order of the commanding general. Agreement With Sultan of Sulus. The authorities of the Sulu Islands have accepted the succession of the United States to the rights Of Spain, and our flag floats over that territory. On the 10th of August-, 1899, Brigadier-General Bates, United States volunteers, negotiated an agreement with the sultan and his prin cipal cniels, which I transmit herewith. Rebellion Nearly Ended. I communicate these faefs to the con gress for its Information and action. Everything indicates that with the speedy suppression of the Tagal rebellion, life in the archipelago will soon assume its ordi nary course under the protection of. our sovereignty, and the people of those fa vored islands will enjoy a prosperity and a freedom which they have never before known. Already hundreds of schools are open and filled with children. Religious freedom is sacredly assured and enjoyed, and the courts are dispensing justice. Business Is beginning tq circulate in Its accustomed channels. Manila, whose In habitants were fleeing to the country a few months ago, is now a populous and thriving mart of commerce. The earnest and unremitting endeavors of the com mission and the admh-al and major-general commanding the department of the Pacific to assure the people of the benefi cent intentions of this government, have had their legitimate effect in convincing the great mass of them that peace and safety and prosperity and stable govern ment can only be found In a loyal accept ance of the authority of the United States, - The Duty of Cona-ress. The future government of the Philip pines rests with the congress of the Unit ed States. Few graver . responsibilities have ever been confided to us. If w e accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and traditions, great opportunity comes with them. The islands lie under the shelter of our flag. They are ours by every title of law and equity. They can not be abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and finally to barbarism. We fling them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival powers, no one of which would permit another to seize them unquestioned. Their rich plains and valleys would be the scene of endless strife and bloodshed. The advent of Dewey's- fleet in Manila bay, Instead of being, as we hope, the dawn of a new day of freedom and progress, would have been the beginning of an era of misery and violence worse than any which has dark ened their unhappy past. It does not seem desirable that I should recommend at this time a specific final form of government for these Islands. When peace shall be restored It will be the duty of congress to construct a plan of government which shall . establish and maintain freedom and order and peace in the Philippines. The Insurrection is still existing, and when it terminates, further information will be required as to the actual condition of affairs before Inaugu rating a permanent scheme of civil gov ernment. The full report of the commission, now in preparation, will contain information and suggestions which will be of value to congress, and which I will transmit as soon as it is comnleted. As long as the Insurrection continues, the military arm must necessarily be supreme. MWS FOR 

ALASKA. Necessity for Immediate Letrlslatlv ' Action. A necessity for Immediate legislative ac tion exists In the territory of Alaska Substantially the only law providing t civil government for this territory is th act of May 17, 1884. This is meager in iti provisions and is fitted only for the ad ministration of affairs In a country sparse ly inhabited by civilized people and unim portant In trade and production, as was Alaska at the time this act was passed. The increase in population by immigra tion during the past few years, consequent upon the discovery of gold, has produced such a condition as calls for more ample facilities for local self-government and more numerous conveniences of civil and judicial administration. THE PUERTO RICANS. Hardships Worked by the Laws at Present In Force. I recommend that legislation " to the same end be had with reference to Puerto Rico. The time ' Is ripe for the adoption of a temporary form of government for this island, and many suggestions made with reference to Alaska are applicable also to Puerto Rico. The system of civil jurisprudence now adopted by the people of this island is described by competent lawyers who are familiar with it, as thoroughly modern and scientific, so far as it relates to matters of Internal busi ness, trade, production and social and private rights in general. The cities of tho island are governed under charters which probably require very little or no change. So that with relation to matters of local concern and private rights, it is not probable that much, If any, legislation is desirable; but with reference to pub lic administration and the relations of the islands to the federal government there are many matters which are of pressing urgency. Her Principal Markets Close. It must be borne In mind that since the cession Puerto . Rico has been denied the principal . market ' she . had long . en joyed, and our tariff has been continued against her products as when she was un der Spanish sovereignty. The marko of Spain are closed to her products ex cept upon terms to which the comm.irco of all nations Is subiected. The island o Cuba, which used to buy her cattle and tobacco without customs duties, now im poses the same duties upon theje products as from any other country entering her ports. She has, therefore, lost her free In tercourse with Spain and Cuba without any compensating benefits in thU market. Her coffee was little known and not In use by our people, and therefore, there was no demand here for this, one of her chief products. The markets of the United States should be opened up to her prod ucts. Our plain duty Is to abolish all customs tariffs between the United States and Puerto Rico and give her products free ac.ess to our markets. ' As a result of the hurricane which swept over Puerto Rico on the 18th of August, 1899, over 100,000 people were re duced to absolute destitution, . without homes, and deprived of the necessaries of life. To the appeal of the war department the people of the United States made prompt and generous response. In addi tion to the private charity of our people, the war department has expended for the relief of the distressed $392,342 63, which does not include the cost of transporta tion. 

OTHER MATTERS DISCUSSED. Mob Law Denounced Lynching; Must Not Be Tolerated. The love of law and sense of obedience and submission to tbe- lawfully . consti tuted tribunals are Imbedded ' In the hearts of our people, and any viola tion of these sentiments and disregard of their obligations Jwtly arouses publla condemnation. The guaranties of life, lib erty and of civil rights should be faithfully upheld; the right of trial by Jury re spected and defended. The rule of the courts should assure the public of the prompt trial of those charged with crim inal offense, and upon conviction the pun ishment should be commensurate with the enormity of the crime. Those who In disregard of law and public peace, unwilling to await the judgment of court and jury, constitute themselves judges and executioners should not escape the severest penalties of their crimes. Extending; the Classified Service. The executive order of May 6, 1896, ex tending the limits of the classified serv ice, brought within the operation of the civil service law and rules nearly all of the executive civil service not previously classified. Some of the Inclusions were found wholly illogical and unsulted to the work of the several departments. The application of the rules to many of the places so included was found - to result in friction and embarrassment. After long and very thorough consideration, it be came evident to the heads of the depart ments responsible for their efficiency that in order to remove these difficulties and promote an efficient and harmonious ad ministration, certain amendments were necessary. These amendments were pro mulgated by me in executive order dated May 29, 1899. Anniversary of Washington's Death. The 14th of December will be the one hundredth anniversary of the death of Washington. For a hundred years the re public has had the priceless advantage of the lofty standard of character and conduct which he bequeathed to tbe American people. It is an inheritance which time, instead of wasting, "continu ally Increases and enriches. We may justly hope that in the years to come the benignant influence of the father of bis country may be even more potent for good than in the century which is draw ing to a close. I have been glad to learn that in many parts of the country the people will fittingly observe this historic anniversary. Responsibilities of Congress. Presented to this congress are great op portunities. With them come ereat re- sponsibilitles. The power confided to us increases the weight of our obligations to the people, and we must be profoundly sensitive of them as we contemplate the new and grave problems which confront us. Aiming only at the public good, we cannot err. A right Interpretation of the people's will and of duty cannot fail to Insure wise measures (or the welfare of the islands which have come under the authority of the United States, and lnurs to the common Interest and lasting honor of our country. Never has this nation had more abun dant cause than during the past year for thankfulness to God for manifold bless ing and mercies, for which wa make reverent acknowledgment. ' , WILLIAM M'KINLEY.

FIFTY-SIXTH CONGRESS Senate Adjourned Early as a Mark of Respect. HENDERSON ELECTED SPEAKER Objection Bailed to Roberts Taking the Oath and Action Postponrd Fending Report of Special Committee, Washington, Dec. 5. Appropriate tribute to the memory of the late Vice President Hobart was paid by the sen ate today at its first session of the 56th congress Monday. Tho session lasted only 83 minutes, and only the most formal and necessary business was tran sacted. After the adoption of the usual routine resolutions and the administra tion to the new members of the oath of office, Sewell (Rep. N. J.) presented fitting resolutions upon the death of the vice-president, the resolutions were ordered to be communicated to the house oi representatives, and the ses sion, on motion of Kean (Rep. N. J.) was suspended. Ab usual on the opening days of con gress, the senate chamber was a verita ble conservatory. Pending the actual convention of the senate, the chamber presented a most animated and pictur esque scene. The galleries were filled with a brilliant and distinguished aud ience. Two protests were filed, one against the seating of Quay and the other against Clark, of Montana. . In the Home. Washington, Dec. 6. Enormous crowds witnessed the opening scenes in the house yesterday. The principal interest centered in the disposition of Roberts,' the Mormon representative from Utah. Those who anticipated a sensational denoument were disappoints ed. The programme outlined by the nepu oilcan leaaers ' ixieir comerence Friday night was partially carried out. , The objection to the administration of the oath to Roberts was entered by Tayler, of Ohio, as predicted, and he stepped aside without protest except to ask if by doing so he waived any of his rights. To this the speaker responded in t.h neirative. There was not a mo- test from any quarter against the objec tion to the administration of the oath to Roberts, but on the contrary the only voice raised, except that of Tayler, was that of McRae. a Demcorat of Arkan- tin a nrlin lninoil xiti t"Vi Tavlflr in Ilia rrm- test. Tayler offered his resolution to refer the case to a special committee, and by mutual arrangement the consid eration of the resolution was postponed until tomorrow, in order that the rou tine business in connection with the organization might be transacted today. ' Although Roberts was not sworn in today, he secured a seat. This was by an accident, pure and simple. In the seat-drawing lottery, no provision had been made for Roberts, but when the drawing was completed two others, as well as himself, had not been provided with seats, and the speaker asked and seoured from the house permission for thnaa mAmhersi who had not drawn seats to make such selections as they could. Under this authority, Roberts got a seat in an obscure portion of the hall. His daughter sat in the gallery and watched the proceedings from be ginning to end. . : After the election of Speaker Hen derson and his induction into office, the appointment of the usual commit tees to wait upon the president, the seat-drawing contest, with the usual amusing features, went off . without a hitch. The only feature out of the or dinary was the reception of the Reed rules as the rules for the present con gress. They were adopted by a strict party vote. Seldom, if ever, have such enormous crowds swarmed around the house- to witness the opening scenes of the ses sion as besieged the doors today. - Very early in the day a monster peti tion, said to consist of 7,000,000 names, protesting against the seating of Roberts, was brought into the hall. It had been collected by the New York Journal. It consisted of 28 rolls of names, each about two feet in diam eter, encased in the American flag. These rolls were stacked up in the area in front of the clerk's desk and were viewed with great curiosity. 

COAL MINERS STRIKE. Women .Use Gnns and Knives to Drive Men From 'Work. Cheyenee, Wyo., Deo. 6. A week ago 600 miners employed in the mines of the Diamondville Coal & Coke Com pany, at Diamondville, Wyo., struck for an increase in wages. Their de mands were refused, and a small force of non-union men went to work. At an early hour this morning a mob of 300 women and girls, armed with guns, knives, clubs and stones, marched to the mines and compelled the operators to flee. The miners at work were dragged from the mines and also driven away. . Several were injured by being struck with clubs, and one man was shot at, presumably by one of the "number of strikers concealed near the mines. The small force of deputies guarding the company's property was powerless. The miners have been importing arms and ammunition and more trou ble is looked for. , Caught In a Cave-In. Denver, Dec. 4.
