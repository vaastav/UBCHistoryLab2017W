COOK PLEADS MIND UNBALANCED DCN'T KNOW THAT HE FOUND NORTH PCLC WILL RZTUP.N TO UNITED STATES. NEW YORK, Dec. 6. Dr. Fied- ick A: Cook, the Brooklyn explorer, in an article which will be published in Hampton's magazine, confesses that he .does not know whether he reached the north pole or not. Dr. Cook, who has been in hiding for over a year, has informed the editors of the ma azine publishing his story that he will return to the United States wlti hla wife and children December 22, ia or der to spend Christmas here. Dr. Cook in his story deals with the psychology of his adventure and says: "Did I get to the North Pole Per haps I made a mistake in thinking that I did. Perhaps I did not make a mistake.' After mature thought, I con fess that I ' did not' know absolutely whether I reached the pole or not. This may come as an amazing state ment, but I am willing to startle the world, if tr so Hoing V can get an op portunity to present my case. ' By my ease,-1 mean not my case as a geo graphical discoverer,' but my case as a man. Much as the attainment of the North Pole once meant to ' me, the sympathy and confidence of my feliow- rnen mean more. . fit after reading my Btory, you say, 'Cook is sincere and honest; half crazed by months of isolation and hun ger, he believed he reached the pole ; he is not a fakir; then I shall be satis fied."'
