"Grangerism," in origin, philosophy and fact, is organized opposition to rings and corporations as plunderer of States. Ru tabagaism, on tho contrary, is tho embodi ment of ring and corporation power in the creation of government. It was Orunger im that would compel Tom Scott to serve Texas if Texas served Tom Scott. It was Uutahagaiam that, in order to secure the services of Tom Scott's riot? in fastening the new Constitution on the State, endowed a corporation openly hostile to Texas with enormous wealth and resistless power over men, corporations and newspapers in Texas. Grangcriaui loves tho State. . Rutabagaisin ravages the State, tirangcrinui is honest and frank and fearless. Ittitabagaism never does an act directly which it may do indi rectly. Instead of rentricting suffrage aud giving counties and towns good local gov ernments nnd a decent judiciary, the negro counties are disfranchised by a system of I errymauderiog, aud judicial districts, as crKiked as the time serving wlicy of dema gogues that suggested the cviminn of right aud thus begat the consummation of a foul wioug, ore constructed. Grangers arc hon rt farmers.

The honest, toiling people of Texan towns urn not to lc trusted witii the dispo sition of their own property. The pious, good, great nud wise Ilutabagas como mod estly to the front and declare that we can not don we please with our own. , AVby not? The answer is simple. The Kutaba- ... vt i . i. .. li.i- i .1 uas leareu to uucihi tne raooie uj uiairnu- ( niamg it in corporations, ami tnus tne gov ernment of -Toxus becomes offensive as thu most odious of centralized despotisms. Gran gers, on the contrary, are Republican freemen, devoted to the political philosophy of Tlionuis Jefferson. The words "Home Ilulu" wero collocated to embody the whole theory of true Americauism in gov ernment. Rutabagaism has violated it in almost every clauso of the new Constitu tion. Future legislatures will find them selves, if this proposed organic code be adopted, shackled hand and foot, and help less and powerless. Grangerism would give to legislature, representing thu people directly and fresh from their midst, tho broadest freedom and unrestricted powct But future legislatures, tho Rutabagas said, are not to be trusted. "We know it all, and these legislatures, elected under systems of unrest i icted suffrage,' will be full of knaves. We will uot protect the ballot box and leave tho legislature free; but we will tie the hands of tho legislature aud leave the bal lot box to pollution. Honest, fearless Grangers would have reversed this policy of Rutabagaism aud restricted suffrago at least by the imposition of a poll tax. Hut weonly proposed to show that when we have designated a system of legislation by tho term "Rutabagaism" we had no ref erence whatever to the Grangers of Tcxa. The intelligent members of Urauges con demn, as we do, tho whole theory of the new Constitution. It is founded in a Nlse philosophy and in thorough igtiorauce of the theory of pure republicanism in govern ment, and no IVmocrat, comprehending the principles on which the party of Jeffer son w louuded, without stultifying him self, rsn vote for this RuUlmg Constitu tion. Ton nCOTT F1H1LVZED, We concur with th Shieveport Timt$ that a Southern Pacific Railway i a neces sity of tho South; but no Southern Pacific Railway should be socoustiucted or placed iu such hands that th. South only contrib ute to its resources while it gives nothing to tho South. The wealth aud travel from Tiaa aud the Fonth wonld flow into tho highway at the one hundred and fourth parallel of longitude and bo liorne to Cali fornia; but tho riches of the Orient and of California would all be given to U Louis aud Philadelphia. When Texas endowed tho Southern Pacific with richca, it was de signed to Ik? a Southern road. Rut Tom S-.'ott is oeo of the largest shareholder in tho groat bridge at St. Louis; he owes, wo aie told, tho trustees of tho Atlantic and PaciHe (St. I-ouis and Viuita) road several millions. Therefore, Tom Scott would sell Texas and the Texas and P&ciJic to St. IrfMiis to enrich bis bridgo and to pat tho debt ho owes on account of his speculation In the stock of tho exploded Atlantic and Pacific bubble. Tho lection of Kerr to tho Speakership is Scott's overthrew, and no Southern Congresiman, cognizant of the fact influencing Scott and of his purpose to vreit tho designs of the State of Texas by oicg Texan wealth to build a St. Louis road aa Southern Congressman will daro -j..n Krati'i scheme in tho House. But i it uoiSt- foul shame that Rutabaguism, swloir all these facts, undertook to buy Tom Srott's Influence, in bektlf of tho ab surd bw Constitution, by renewing the land ., .t inada when the Texas and Pacific was jM-Dtiico ."i'wfifr Pacific 'railway" "Hue.

But the election of Kerr empties freezing cold water on the nerves and muscles of the Philadelphia giant and the new Consti tution must'owfl Its ' adoption" at last, if adopted, to the rigorous exertions of that lively lot of gnod fellows who love it and admire it, how passionately and fervently we may never know, because they expect to hold offices under it. ; Cut Tom Scott is stricken with a dreadful paralysis and Texa, when Cougress adjourns, will have escaped forever from his clutches. AN EXTRAORDINARY LETTER BT- SINES MEN SIIOCLD BEAD IT. ite following remarkable letter mil ar rest the attention of every mercantile read er of the STATEfiUAX. Experience has stored up a vast deal of practical wisdom in the brain of the observer of current facts who wrote this paper: Mtrtle Gbove, Texas, December, 1875, Editor t Democratic fitaUtinan1 read your paper each week and my copy is bor rowed in succession by three of my neigh bors, snd how much further it goes l can not tell. I am only careful to read it and the advertisements before it passes from my hands. Since yon refer to it and would know how many people read each copy of the Statesman. I can tell you that certain ly twelve white adults read each copy of the Statesman that comes to this office. While your advertisers are profited, it occurs to me that you are most villainously cueaicu. These borrowers rob yon and annoy me, and it is consciousness of this fact that in duces me to write this note. I have ob served another fact which merchants every where should comprehend.- I see that the borrowers of my Statesman give their or ders for dry coods and groceries, boots, shoes and millinery exclusively to those whose advertisements appear in the States- Kan. It is therefore true that Austin mer chants owe you commissions on every order that goes from this county to your trades men. But you derive no advantage from these people. Those who do not advertise are certainly losing trade. Their business does not grow with the country's growth, while the enterprising, pushing, vigorous advertiser, as I see iroiu tne conduct ol my good neighbors who borrow the Statesman, is constantly extending hir business and becoming more and more widely known. If Texas stood still, if new populations were not coustantly added to the old, the old es tablished merchant would need little am from the Statesman ; but the incoming peo Die from other States can only lecome fa miliar with names and faces and the busi ness of men by always seeing them in the pHgesof the newspaper. After reading about some (rood fellow of Austin for three or four months in each number of the States man, 1 begin to tet-i nae ne is an oui friend of mine, and if he advertise any thing I want I walk over the whole town till I find the nmn. Then we have a talk about the advertisement and laugh aliont tlie potency of the press; we take a drink together, and thus I have made a friend through- the intervention of the newspaper. But 1 only began this letter to tell you how it is that a newspaper in the country is high ly valued. Its illusion is not ended when it tells the subsciiber himself all it knows. It then goes missionarying over the neigh borhood. It travels without ' crutches, is never too weary to talk; and never, like a placard or handbill, glanced at and kicked aside. People read newspapers and nil that they contain with infinite av'niity, and es pecially one like the Statesman, which thinks as it pleases and tlien tells all it thinks. But I have written ten lines for each one I proposed to indite when I lagan to discuss the philosophy or advertising as I see it dcvelopsd even here at Myrtle Grove. I would as willingly lend my tooth pick as my newspaper, and I only wished to have you suggest tho fact that my Iki rowing neighbors may no longer harrass me beyond endurance. - It. G. M. TOW SCOTT DONE FOR. Tho Impression obtains that the election of Kerr, the declared enemy of appropria tions by Congress to railways and tteam ships, is fatal to the schemo of Tom Scott, who must now settle with the creditors of the bankrupt Atlantic and Pacific (St. Louis and Viuita) Railway. Mr. Scott will bo forced to pay the paper of the concern which he indorsed for some millions. It is rather rough ou Tom Scott, but a good thing for Texas. In fact, the completion of tho Texas and Pacific to Fort Worth will satisfy the country for a time, and, mean while, the Texas and California company, which has expended fifty- millions of its own money and never received a ' dollar from the government, 'on the line from San Francisco to Sn Diego, will .find money to complete its road to El Paso.' There the Fort Worth and Dallas line will meet one from Galveston, Houston and Austin, und Texas, rather than St. Louis and Philadel phia, will be eunclied by the vast cession of land proposed to I given to a Califor nia and St. Louis company But Tom Scolt is dead. The triumph of Eerr over Randall who belongs to Tom Scott's ring was Scott's final overthrow, and Rutaba gaism's crutch was broken when Tom Scott fell to rise no more in Washington.-, Thk Attorney General, if tho Constitu tion b adopted; will surely have his hands and head full. He is required to bring suit against such coiporaiious as tho Oal veston Wharf Company, but is denied the right of employing assistant counsel. ' He will lie required by emery new officer in ev ery new county to. .explain tnd, define the mode of operntiou of every. new..clausc in the new Constitution and must also devote certainly six mouths to a thorough prepara tion for tho proer eond net of the suit against the Galveston Wharf Company in the Supreme Court of the Tuitcd Stales. Small as lie is, physically, the distinguished gen tleman will have to multiply himself some forty or fifty times. The whnrf company and other corporations sought to be de stroyed or divested of vested rights by the Rutabagas, all except Tom Scott, will cm ploy the ablest lnwyer in and out of Texas, lut the State's attorney can have no assist ants. . It is a flattering estimate of the gen ius and worth of the distinguished Attor ney-General tuns averted by the Constitu tional Convention, but we do not see very ell how he cau meet the exactions upon his professional force and learning thus Imposed by tho extraordinary convention. Til a RuUlg. fellows are now traveling over tho country persuading good, honest, sensible raon to become candidates for all aorta of offices and sinecures created by the new Confutation. ' The more candidates the more adherents there are of tho new code and thero will soon .be enough, the Rutabagas say, to cany it. Then tho San Antonio Erprt has gow in with the J5- amuur and the country is in a blue way. Our good tread, Hon. John Henry Brown, is going over his district getting: out multi plied candidates for motiiptisd offices, and if Tom Scott had uot been killed off by Xbo election of Kerr as Speaker of the House, these teirible forces would have triumphed. But after all these embryo candidates come into the conventions and, except one for each oiace, tre kaocke l on the head, will they not "turn tail" aad ijickia" their handa deep down Into their breeches pock cl, go into a "Crown" study and conclude than Hon. John Henry advised them un wisely t Every fellow obliterated aa a can didate nnder the Constitution will surely deal it a heavy blow when he gets a chance. and it is barely possible that the defeated and disappointed aspirants fcr places will be the deadliest enemies of the new Consti tution. They outnumber the other fellows as ten to one. Minnesota comes to the front on the woman suffrage question. At tho recent State election a large majority was given for tlie constitutional amendment, which pro vides that any woman of twenty-one years of age and upward may vote at any election for officers of schools, or on any meas ure relating to schools, or may be eli gible to any office pertaining to the man agement of schools. All af this would be approved in Texas, if they who voted, in matters affecting the schools, also paid for the maintenance of these institutions. We bsve seen the beneficent school system in operation in cities where the managers were representatives of the illiterate untaxed rabble. Then the school system speedily became a scheme of robbery, and superin tendents speculated in school books and or ganizsd rings inside the board of visitors, and taxpayers groaned, and a city was finally almost confiscated. They who maintain and support a government or a school sjt tern or a railroad or a bask should alone se lect its officers. Westeen Texas votes against the new Constitution because of its sectionalism; because it handcuffs counties and towns, and, of course, prohibits improvements and progress. Western Texas, whatever Ruta bagaism thinks to the contrary, docs not rejoice when it pays twenty-five per cent, mare for all it consumes and sells all it ex ports for fifty per cent, less than other por tions of the State, and all because the east monopolizes, under the new Constitution, all concessions made by the proposed new government. Even grants of public lands heretofore made for canals and ditches for irrigation have been revoked. Western Texas will never vote for the new Conrtitn tion. ' People say the Statesman has underta ken a big job when it fights the forces of officcseekers battling for pap under the new Constitution. We understand perfectly what we are talking shout and the result of our policy.. The new Constitution may be adopted. The consequence will 1e that when the officcseekers have fastened it on the State the people will begin to feel the force of wrongs inflicted on themselves and the absurdity of that philosophy which is forever prattling about Democracy, and yet accepts an organic code that defies and de feats every principle an 3 purpose of Democ racy. ' In reply to a letter-writer we have to say that he knows lit'.lc of the duties or re sponsibilities or honors of the editorial profession who abandons it to gain any or dinary political preferment. Since suffrage has been polluted the value of office con sists only in the money incident to its ten ure and therefore the depravity that pre vails in government, aud therefore' the higher the relative position of the journal ist who comprehends the duties and respon sibilities of his profession. Tup. Democratic and intelligent press of Texas, the Kem-Jhy, says, "almost unan imously condemn the refusal of the Ruta bagas to restrict suffrage in county and town elections." Instead of this they twisted and gerrymandered judicial dis tricts iu order to disfrarchise the negro counties nnd in resorting to cowardly arts of demagogism, they destroy the capacity of the courts to administer justice. Who can approvo such a constitution ? Tweed is tho great living, lively, ecstatic representative of corporation robbers. He and his " pals," who stole from thirty to fifty millions, were born of the tanteitllotUt. He was of those who buy and sell votes. He represented those who had no interest, direct or indirect, in the city they ruled and ravaged. ne stole for himself some seven or ten millions of money, and by its liberal use has escaped the clutches of the law. Our dispatches say that the extradition laws do not cover his case. IT IS ABSOLUTELY IIORRIRLE. The new Constitution, which sensible cit izens are asked to vote for, reserves and grants to Tom Scott and ties np for him a reservation of more than thirty millions of acres. The tract conveyed is nearly seven hundred miles long and eighty wide. Of this Tom Scott gets half. The adoption of this bastard Constitution ties up the whole of this vast rich district of country for years, and no sane, sensible Texan will vote for if. ' ' ' ; ' ' ' It was not the Statesman that was incon sistent.' We did sty that tho Constitutional Convention was' mqst generous ' to .Tom Scott and - so niggardly in concessions to other railways that all otliers and" their owners are hostile to the Constitution. "It was not the Statesman that was inconsist ent in assertion; but the Constitution in fact. Why was Tom Scott so peculiarly blest in winning the affection of the hay zy headed Rutabagas V I JrooK Duval, at Tyler, declared thecivil rights act constitutional, and yet white peo ple would obliterate the color line in poli tics, even as Radicalism would have us do in social life. The one consummation will follow the other as tho night the day, and blackness in morals and intelligence wil) lie universal as the suffrage The Cuero -vr should proclaim it, and the people of Mason never forget that few people of the. better class care to emigrate to a country where they think it necessary to wear a six-shooter at their tide, a bowie knife ia their boot, and keep an eye over both shoulders to insure safety.'

There is no reason why the good Enterprite should ever catch Hell. Hon. George F.

The Neirs-tiHil-Courier euys: "Marian Singer, daughter of the sewing machine in ventor, has appeared upon the stage in San Francisco in burlesque." She ought to be a "Singist" and devote herself unhooded to Hood's song of the shirt. The sewing machiue swindler arrested at Sherman is named Langdou Chevcs, a name illustrious and historical iu South Carolina. We arc curious to know whether this be his name. Is it not assumed ? We never heard of a descendant of these old Huguenots whoawiisotlier than an honest gentleman. : The pool '-sellers on the great four-mile race in California hold more than $'200,000 to await tlie result.

The United States Senate, at its next ses sion, will be pretty equally divided politi cally. The Senators may be classified as follows ; Forty - Republicans, (including Alcorn, Robertson, . Hamilton and Ed munds) ; twenty-nine Democrats, and three independent liepublicans--Booth, Chris tiancy and Cameron of Wisconsin. There are two vacancies to be filled, one caused by the recent death of Mr. Ferry, of Connecti cut, and the eternal vacancy from Louisiana claimed by Pinchback. A Democratic Sen ator will be chosen in place of . Ferry, of Connecticut, wbicli will give the Democrats thirty, instead of twenty-nine votes. Should a Democrat be-elected from Louisi ana, as is thought probable, and he be ad mitted to a seatsvhich ia believed, improba ble, the Democrats will muster thirty-one votes. From the total Republican vote take those whose votes cannbt always be counted upon Alcorn, Robertson,' Hamilton and Edmunds and their list is diminished to thirty-six. Leaving out the question of tho Louisiana senatorship, the Democrats will be able to cast a total vote of thirty. Add to this the four doubtful Republicans above named and they will have thirty-four. To.this,add thrco Inde pendents, Booth, Chrisliancy, aud .Cameron of Wisconsin, and the opposition to' the un doubted Republican element wvmld number thirty-seven, or a majority of -one. AIi though most of the Senators put down s doubtful or IudMiadeut liuiblicrins more frequently voti with the .Republicans than the Democrats, it will be seen tit a glance that when they do the latter they will leave the 'Republicans' in the minority.

The Chairman of the Democratic Execu tive Committee of Galveston county prom ises, in a letter to Hon. J. D.

The Immigrant speaks justly when it says of Capt. F. M. Martin, late of the Consti tutional Convention, from Corsicana, "that he worked earnestly and faithfully for the interest of our State, and was recognized as one of its truest and best working members. Like Brown, of Kentucky, he says he is willing Ho 6tand by the record' " The judges of the Supreme Court hold offices six years, judges of the appellate court four years from next November. All the remaining officers hold two years from the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November, or until their successors are elected and qualified. Their term of office will consequently be for two years and seven months. The Corsicana Immigrant says "the Con stitutional Convention must have discovered a great reform in the people of this country, as we see they have assigned Navarro to the Thirteenth Judicial District, and appointed no time for the holding ot court in this county, or limited us to any specified length of session. So we stand unbridled in this respect. It will make times cay for the people, but it will be dreadful dull for lawyers." The Bastrop Aicertiter says that as a suc cessor to Col. Clark, who declines a re-elee-tion, "we know of no man whom the peo ple generally would prefer to Col. W. S. Walton, of Austin. He is now in the prime of his manhood. Of a splendid personal appearance, the vigor and breadth of his mind is fully equal to his physical strength, while the qualities of his heart stand forth in proportional prominence. He is a fine specimen of physical, moral and intellec tual manhood." All of which is true as gospel. TKLEGRAPll 1C. I Associated Press Dlsuatcoea.1 Washington, December 4.

Washington, December 0. Representa tive Kerr rcceivsd many of his friends to day, who called to congratulate him on his nomination for tho speakership. All par tics concede his fitness for the position. The remarks ot Representative Randall, in caucus, and his motion to make the nomi nation unanimous, are everywhere spoken of id terms of commendation. Surprise is expressed that the West and South carried all the offices. For the two or three hun dred subordinate places there are at least a thousand applicants, not a few of whom are already at work to secure the respective positions, including clerks, assistant door keepers, messengers, document folders, pages and bath room attendants. A dozen or more. applicants, want the privilege of keeping the restaurant, which has, for some years, been in the possession of George T. Downing, colored. The first business of to-aiorrow will con sist of calling the roll of members by Mo Pherson, the present clerk, and tho admin istration of the oath of office; next, the election of speaker, clerk, doorkeeper, aer-gcant-at-arms, - postmaster - nnd - chaplain. Questions affecting the seala of some of the members ma f arise, and therefore the or ganization bo protracted by debate. In view of such an event the President will not transmit' bis message to Congress nntil Tuesday noon, which, ia the more probable time for that purpose. The document is longer than that of last year by about fif teen printed pages, in document form, and contains upward of sixteen thousand words. The message will be telegraphed to the press of the country. Washington, December. $. The Senate wis' called to order. Senator Ferry in the chair.

New York December fj. Diligent (march U being made for Tweed. .Last night he was in charge of the officers and went to his home to visit his wife. He wished to see her alone, was permitted to do so, and was heard of do more. Telegrams have been sent to the different cities to keep a lookout for him. Twenty minutes after his escape was known word reached every po lice station in the city. : Not the slightest clue can be discovered as. to his wherea bouts. A reward of ten thousand dollars is offered for his capture. Jjitcr The bouse was searched from top to bottom, bat no trace of the fugitive was found. .

It is not positive wbetner any indictment lor lorgery has been found against him, and the ques tion of his extradition is, therefore, an open one. The trial in the aix million suit was to have commenced to-morrow. New York, December . It has been as certained that Tweed'a private secretary was last seen at his stopping place a few minutes before the departure of the 10 o'clock for Boston Saturday morning:- He took that train, saying he was iroing to Boston and would return Tuesday. He, however, carried a large trunk. It is ru mored at the Fifty-ninth street police sta tion last evening that on Saturday, from 4 to 5:30 r. x., a tug was noticed cruising in a mysterious manner in the East rive. off Fifty-ninth street.

Tho House took a recess till 1 r. .v., when tho drawing tor seats will take plscc, after which the President's message will be read. Wabhinoton, December 7. The Presi dent's message opens: " In submitting my seventh annual mes sage to Congress in the centennial year of our national existence as a free and inde pendent people, it affords me great pleasure to recur to the advancement thil has been from the time of the colonies one hundred years ago. Wo were then a people num bering 3,000,000; now we numbvr 4 0,00(1, -000. Then industries were confined almost exclusively to the tillage of the soil ; now manufactures absorb much of the labor of the country. Our liberties remain unimpaired; tne oondsiuen have Itcen freed from slavery, and we have lecoiiie possessed of the re spect, if uot the friendship of all civil:7.ed nations." Graphic and well worded details then follow. The President earnestly recommends that a constitutional amendment be submitted to tho legislatures making it the duty of each State to cstal- j lish and forever maintain free public schools adequate to the education of all children in elementary branches, within their re- j spective limits, irrespective of sex, color, birthplace or religion; forbidding the teaching in said schools of religious, athe istic or pagan tenets, and prohibiting the granting of any school funds or school taxes, or any part thereof, either by legis lative, municipal or other authority, for the benefit or in aid, directly or indirectly, of any religious sect .or denomination, or iu aid or for the benefit of any other object of any nature or kind whatsoever. . He alludes to the importance of correcting the evil of vast amounts of untaxed church property, and estimates that by 1890, if un checked, this property will reach a sum ex ceeding three thousand million dollars. He would suggest the taxation of all property equally, excepting only the last resting place of the dead. Our relations with most foreign powers continue on a satisfactory and friendly footing. The President is happy to announce the passage of an act by the general Cortes of Portugal abolishing slavery in the colonics. The past year has f ui nished no evidence ot an approaching , termination of tho ruinous conflict which has been rag ing for years in Cuba. The same disregard of the laws of civilized 'warfare and just de mands of humanity which have heretofore called for the expiession of condemnation from the nations of Christendom, have con tinued to blacken the scene. Desolation, rain and pillage ' are pervading the rich fields of one of the most fertile and produc tive regions on the earth; the incendiary's torch is firing plantations and valuable fac tories and buildings these are the agents marking the alternate advance and retreat of the contending parties. ' The President naratea the damage to the interests of commercial nations, especially those of the United States, and insecurity of property owned by citizens of the United States in Cuba. He had hoped Spain would bo enabled to establish peace in her colony. Because of this hope, and from an extreme reluctance t interfere in the affairs of another, and a friendly nation, he has patiently and anxiously awaited the progress of events. The armed bands of either side now occupy grounds as in the past. Tho President mskes a long argument, and concludes; "A recognition cf the independence of Cuba being, in my opinion, - impracticable and - indefensible, the question next presents itself is, that of recognition of belligerent rights in the par ties to the contest. "After further argume nt the President concludes : 'The recognition of independence or of belligerency being thus, in my judgment, equally inadmisasvhlu, it remains to consider, what course shall be adopted. Should the. conflict not soon be brought to an end by acta of .the parties themselves, and should the evils which result therefrom, affecting all ' nations and articnlarly the United States, . contin ue, in such an event, I am of the opinion that other nations will be compelled to as sume the responsibility which devolves upou them, and to seriously consider the only remaining measures, mediation and intervention." , . ; , , . . .... . x The Market. , j. . ...
