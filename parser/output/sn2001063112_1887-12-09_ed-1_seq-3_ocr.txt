Then lollow the figures of the trea sury department showing the surplus at the end of the present fiscal year, ui.d the president draws deductions from them in support of his argument, lie continues: There scums to lie no assurance that v. iui such a withdrawal from use of lae people's circulating medium the l- :. iiiess community may not in the n-.ir Iuture be subjected to the same distress which was quite lately pro duced from the same cause, and while the unctions of our national treasury should lie few and simple, and while its best condition would be reached, 1 believe by its entiredisconnectiou with the private business interests,and by a perversion of its purposes it idly link's money uselessly subtracted from the channels of trade.there seems to be room for the claims that legitimate means should be devised by the gov eminent to restore in an emergency without waste or extravagance such money to a place among the people. Lf such an emergency arises there now exists no clear and undoubted ex ecutive power of relief. There follows a suggestion that the surplus may be used to lake up the government b.inds—if the holders are willing to give ihetn up. The presi dent goes on to say: 1 have deemed it my duty thus to bring to the knowledge of my country men as well as to the attention of their representatives, the gravity of our tin ancial situation. The failure of the congress heretofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature of the difficulty must necessarily produce, caused a condition of financial distress and apprehension since the last adjournment,which taxed to the utmost all the authority and ex pedients within executive control, and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued in activity of congress, the responsibility must rest where it belongs. t-'ree Trade Itecoiniuuuiled. It needs hardly to be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy we can only be saved from a predicament by a removal of the cause. Our scheme of taxation, by which this needless surplus is taken from the peo ple and put into the public treasury, consists of a tariff of duties levied on importations from abroad and internal revenue, taxes levied on the con sumption of tobacos and spiritous and malt liquors. It must be consid ered tnat none of these taxes relating to anything subjected to internal reve nue taxes, are strictly speaking neces sary. Our present tariff laws, the va rious inequitable arid illegal source ot unnecessary exaction, ought to be at once revised and amended. In a readjustment of the tariff the interests of American labor engaged in manufactories should be carefully considered as well a3 the preservation of our manufaeturies. It may ue called protection or by any other name but relief from the hard ships ami dangers of our present tarifl laws should be devised with especial precaution against imperiling' the ex istence of our manufacturing interest •But this existence should not mean a condition which without regard to the public welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realization of immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns. articles that he needs which are man ufactured abroad. flow It Should bt Done. Ihe considerations which have been Fn^n1} t0!'chln8 our tariff laws are intended only to enforce an earnest ecouunendation that the surplus rev enue oi the government be prevented !l" a 01 our custom duties and at the same tune to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose we may discharge a double dun to our people by granting to them a means ot relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed aim lrom sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. lie question thus imperatively pre sentod tor solution should be-approach ed in a spirit higher than partisanship, and considered in the light of that re gard for patriotic duty which should characterize the action of those in trusted with the weal of a corilidinfr people, but the obligation to a declared party policy and principle is not want ing to urge prompt and effective action. 13oth or the great political parties now represented in the government, have, by repeated and authoritative declara tions, condemned the condition of our laws which permit the collection from the people ot unnecessary revenue, and have, in the most solemn manner, promised us correction. But the entire withdrawal of such advantage should not becontempi ated. rhe question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant, and the persistent claim made in certain quarters that any ef forts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation, are the schemes of so-called free traders is mischievious and far removed from' any consideration for the public good The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economi cal administration of the government, and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the treasury, through a perversion of government powers. These things can and should be done without danger to the opportunity for remunerative labor which our working men need and with benelit to them and all our people, by cheapening their means of subsistence and increasing the measure of their comforts. The Condition of the Country. The constitution provides that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the Union, it has been the custom of the executive iu compliance with this provision to annually ex hibit to the congress at the opening of its session the general condition oi the country, and to detail with some par ticulars the operations ol the different executive departments. It would be especially agreeable to follow this course at the present time and to call attention to the valuable accomplishments of these de partments during the last liiscal year, but am so much impressed with the paramount importance of the subject to which this communication has thus far been devoted, that shall forego the addition of any other topic ami only urge upon your immediate consid eration the state of the union asshown by the present condition of our treas ury and our general fiscal situation upon which every element of our safety and prosperity depends. The re ports of the heads of departments, which will be submitted, contain full mid explicit information, touching the transaction of business intrusted them, and sucii recommendations relat ing to legislation in pub interest as they deem ad visable. I ask for these reports and recommendations the deliberate, ex amination and action of the legislative branch of the government. There are other subjects not em braced in the department reports de manding legislative consideration and which 1 should be glad to submit. .Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as to them beg leave to report prior recom mendations. As the law makes no provision for any report from the department of state a brief history of transactions iu that important depart ment. together with other matter which may hereatter be deemed essential to commend to the attention of congress, may furnish the occasion for a future communication.
