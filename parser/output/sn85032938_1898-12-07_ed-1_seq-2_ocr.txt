lRm)NAJOimiAL.-INEK WEDNESDAY DEC. 7, 1S93 J.C HAKTIS. Editor and Proprietor THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE." President McKinley a message to congress is a very voluminous and exhaustive document.

The rabid press of Arizona which eternally i? endeavoring' to mislead beoole in a rampant manner on the mm. " wreckage that prevails in official channels as back of the present na tional administration, is nothing more n r lss than uu-American and oz'.ng as it does from a section .that i striving to go ahead and is endeavoring to make its industries known to eastern people of wealth and influence, creates the impres sion that tre are degenerating. Stand by the flasr wherever it waves in duty, aud stand by the man who holds the staff in patriotic devotion. There is no "let up" in the busi ness improvement which the repub lican victory brought.

The Texas is soon to sail for Manila, and she will be the flag ship of Admiral Dewey. A difficult financial proposition: Is Mr. Goldberg, councilman-elect from Maricopa, a gold bug! About the only thing the demo cratic press of late has overlooked, is the Pans riots, in Illonois. Phenix has water troubles of its own, and seems to be facing the knotty problems that Prescott has struggled with. The Wisconsin is said to be stuck deep in the mud at San Francisco. In that respect she is like Arizona on the statehood proposition. Three 'years ago but one Pacific Coast Congressman voted against silver. In the next House the dele gation wll be gold standard 10, sil ver 1. The old man of the Eaterprise, at Pheniz, forgot to mention in his last .issue the removal of Governor Mur phy. Probably he is as tired as the people are. Two ex-Bough Eiders, Corporal Knablauch and Sergeant Worden are on their way to Europe in the hope of finding war there shortly after their arrival. We violate no confidence in say ing that Col. Bryan Li not one of the democrats who wants to nomi nate Dewey for president. The democrat who seeks the nom ination for president, to run against McKinley, will be an air chaser of the first magnitude. The unkindest cut of the car toonists is the picturing of Spain as a jackass. Now,.everjbody knows that the democratic party has ex clusive rights in that animal. The war departmant is preparing a "Medical and Surgical History of the Wat with Spain," that will be studied with interest by members of the medical profession in all coun tries. The question of whether an extra session of congress will be necessary, in the spring, may be safely left to President McKinley, who will be sure to decide It right. With a penitentiary in course of construction in Prescott, the water works inaugurated, mining develop ment progressing, what will be the matter with old Prescott? Seventeen of the twenty western states in which fusion tickets were arraiged this year gave republican majorities. The American people are not admirers of hybrid politics. It has been said that annexing Hawaii would burden us with an elephant. The animal is so well be haved that the Philippines "ele phant" may be expected to turn out equally well. The popular rating of the war heroes, as shown in the naming of new postoffices, now stands as fol lows: Dewey, 17; Schley, 5; Shatter and Sigsbee, 4 each, and Sampson 3.

For the quarter ending Saptornb r 30th, the exports from Manila to the United States aggregated $62, 950.27 in value. A yery creditable showing under the circumstances. ' There is a good prospect that Senator Stewart will be dropped in Nevada. The Senator is the first among that variety of gold bugs who try to force silver on the other fellow. With the people solidly suppoit ing expansion, the individuals who are talking against it are accom plishing about as much as they would -by whistling against a gale. Port Said is credited with being the wickedest place on earth, but if Tammany is kept in charge of New York long that town will be a close second, if not a winning rival. Repudiation of any portion of her national debt, by Spain, would lub ricate the toboggan slide upon whith that country is flying to the bottom of has-beee gulch. Contracts have been signed be tween five of the western railroads for over 53,000,000 worth of steel rails to be used next summer for extension and repairs. That is a substantial evidence of prosperity that cannot be gainsaid. The new empire acquired by the United States contains 161,485 square miles, and a population of 10,226, 624, while the revenue derived from taxation will amount to $44,000,000 a year. When Uncle Sam gets ready to build the Nicaragua canal he is like ly to make short work of the claims now put forth by citizens of the United States and of Central America. An exchange says the man who tried to run a newspaper to suit everybody has been planted under a juniper bush, and the searching katydids now sing his evening dhge and the miile-eared rabbit stands as a sentinel oyer his grave.

When it becomes apparent that he cannot have his own way, or when Uncle Sam's soldier boys give him a trouncing he will change his mind Gov-elect Roosevelt is disappoint ing his enemies by keeping on good terms with all membeis of the re- H lines. Prescott, however, throws aside these features, and goes on the principle of "may the best man win.'".

That is an excelleut metallic com bination also. Hill is for gold and Harrisou lor silver. - The Phenix Enterprise says that the McCord regiment is to be mustered out, and that General McCord will be appointed governor again of Arizona. With all duo re spect to General McCord, Enterprise is a liar. The press of the country is some what engrossed over the new f angled method of voting by machinery, and -the rapidity with which votes nre counted. If there is any genius who can improve on the "machine" methods as they prevailed in Yava pai county at the last election, let him be trotted out. Admiral Dewey's expenditures in shot and shell to sink the Spanish fleet at Manila, according to his own official report, was about $45,000. The cost for the same item in dis posing of Admiral Cervera's fleet, off Santiago, is between $90,000 and $100,000, Experts regard the figures in both cases as surprisingly low. The Enterprise, of Phenix, wants the general government to pass leg islation for the building of big stor age dams, and yet, in its endeavor to see the mammoth enterprise started, it condemns Governor Murphy and each and every financial policy of the Washington administration, which is republican. A new way to secure government aid of this na ture is to crush the source from which it must come. Colorado is swinging rapidly back tnirartl tYin ronnVHan narlt.

Members of the Arkwright Club New York Express Their Grati- fication at His Ap pointment. Last Saturday Chaplain Brcwn received a verv pleasant little re- f-mintbr of his recent visit to New York in the shape of a set Of resolu tions from the Arkwright club of that city. This club is composed for the most part of the principal business men in the viciuitv of Broadway and Wall street. Amonir I the names of those appended can be recognized tr:o present judge advo cate general of New York, the former partner of A. T. Stewart, the present business partner of Secretary Bliss, also his son, and others well known in business circles through out the country. It was through certain members of this club thai Mr. Brown was accorded the priv ilege of admittance to the floor of the N ew York Stock exchange, n privilege by the wav rarelv ever ac corded to any person in the United States unless he be a member of the same. Shortly before leavinc for the west certain members of this club tendered Mr. Brown a farewell luncheon consisting of twelve courses and lasting from oue to five p. m. On learning of his appointment as chaplain they forwarded him the fol lowing: Jcixie Advocate General's Office ) 320 Broadway, New York.

Assistant Secretary Vanderlip of the treasury, has gone to .Porto Rico to look into the money system, the light house service, the coast survey, and other matters that come under the treasury department. Senator Allen-man-who-talks-long of Nebraska, who will be succeeded by a republican, is credited with an intention to becane a rival of Col. Bryan and to fight him for the con trol of the Nebraska delegation to the democratic national convention; but he denies it. An. agent of the department of agriculture succeeded in growing to maturity oats, barley, flax, poiatoes and a number of vegetables in Al aska this year, which proved the falsity of the contention that the summer was too short there to ma ture such crops. to a foreiun syndicate. Dennis Burke is. taking good ore out of his Wizard mine in Big Bag district, and. has commenced ship ping it. The ore is similar in char acter to that of the Little Jessie mine. Pacific Coast papers mention the fact that the Comstock mines are to drained of all water below the 1700 levels, and uew pumping machinery to cost over $3,500,000 is to be put in at OLce. Water power is to bo used to perform the work. The Empire mine, on Upper Groom Crees, has been closed down for the present. The plant on the same is a ro'.Ier mill and proves an unsatisfactory process in handling the ore. It is the intention of the owners to erect a new and complete mill, when the mine will again be started up with a larger force. The new machinery has been ordered and will be in operation not later than February 1 next. Ralph Dillon is said to be en route from England, having -accomplished his task of enlisting foreign capital to operate the Winningham proper ties at Jerome. The starting of the work and the good showing they are said to make, will result in a dozen other properties starting up, and which adjoins them. Jerome will be one of the greatest mining camps in the west under the favorable operation of these mines, which lay right at its door. Placer mining in the Black Can yon country is being carried on more extensively now than ever be fore and with better results. Judge McPhee says that from the amount of gold beiug taken out thore at present the people have about come to adopt the Mexican idea that gold grows, as he says that there is more being taken out now than ever bo fore, although the grouud has been worked there for years. There is talk of putting in a hydraulic plant near Bumble Bee for washing out the gold- J. R. Slack and his son, J. K. Slack, have taken a lease on the Monte Christo mine on Groom creek and have been working it since the first of November." The Monte Christo in the past has maintained the reputation of its uame and it has been a regular treasure producer. Mr. Slack and his son have been hard working industrious miuers ever since thev settled in Arizona and we know of none who are more deservingpf success and of reaping rich Monte Christo treasures than they. Dr. Hendrvx has grjwn tired of runniug his Huntington mill on his Empire -mine on Groom creek, and during his recent visit here he closed down work on the property. The .little mill was inadequate to meet the demands of the miueand he will immediately erect a stamp mill on the property to work the ore. The mine is looking fine, there being large bodies of ore eiposed, arid even with tho old Huutington mill it has been made to pay right along, but Dr. Hendrvx want larger re sults which he can easily obtain by means of a stamp aiill.

Wood has given official notice that he will im pose a fine of $1000 upon any person who promotes the first, and $50upou each promoter or spectator of the second. Representative Hepburn, of Iowa, says the Nicaragua canal must be built, because the people demand it, and the republican party is pledged to do it; that it must be built on american eo". under the American flag, under American po licing, and directly by tho United States government. The intimation thrown out that republican papers are opposing statehood is untrue. Even if they felt in the humor to do so, there is parties whom they have interested in this mine are not known, but it is thought that Marcus Daly, of Mon tana, is one of the hea lest investors if not the sole owner. Mr. Daly is president of the Anaconda copper mininc companv, which owns the famous Anaconda mine. Ilic con fidential mau was in- Arizona for some timo last month, but he would not state tho. nature of his visit. The former, government ruling admitting patent on groups of min ing claims, on one of which $500 worth of work or improvements had been done, was superseded on De cember 17, 1897, by a new ruling from ihe Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner of the Gen eral Land Office, making it necessary to have 8500 work done for each claim before patent could issue. Subsequently the operation of that latter ruling was suspended, upon numerous requests from mine owners everywhere, to go into effect July 1, 1S9S7 Since that date it is necessary to make satisfactory showing that for each claim in a group for which no occasion for it, as the voters of patent is asked, $500 in work or im theterritorv on Novembers decided I provements has been expended, that question.

The rails will be used, in the construction of a railroad in Ireland, and will be the first American rails to be actually put down in the United Kingdom, although stool rails have for a long time past been exported from this country for British colonial posses sions. "Tho order is regarded, with much satisfaction -by the manu facturers as it is looked upon as thw beginning .of orders from the same source, the presumption leing based upon the fact that while the American steel rails aro selling at SIS per ton the English price is sev eral dollars in excess of that figure. The tendency in England is, more over, to higher prices in the future, owing to the scarcity of material in that country, and the refusal of the English manufacturer to modernize his mills. A striking evidence of the superiority of American steel mills and milling machinery is con tained in the statement of the Eng lish agent sent here to inspect the 2500-ton order before its shipment. to the effect that the mill which filled the order was fifty years in ad vance of any similar mill in Eng land as regards its equipment. Deafness Cannot be Cured By local applications, as they cannot reach the diseased portion of the ear. There is only one way to cure deafness, and that is by constitu tional remedies. Deafness is caused by an inflamed condition of the mu cous lining of the Eustachian tube. When this tube gets inflamed, you have a rumbling sound or imperfect hearing, and when it is entirely closed, deafness is the result, and unless the inflammation can betaken out and this tube restored to its normal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever; nine cases out of ten are caused bjr catarrh, which is nothing but an inflamed condition of the mucous surfaces.

Way down here in Ari zona all kinds of money is coming along for investment in our gold nines. Mohave county threatens to rival Yavapai iu the production of gold. Commercially, too, cur Bister county of the north is going ahead, and it seems to be a very inviting locality for iuvestors in good gold claims. Some day Mohave will be the scene of the greatest placer mining prop ositions this side of the Klondike. Indications point that way. If the water works proposition to face Prescott, so favorably as it seems to now, and the construction of the big dam is permitted to be successfully and harmoniously ac complished, together with the fact that tl.e sanitary conditions will be wiped out as they have prevailed, many families of mining men who today live in the hills around us, will come to permanently reside in the city. Every interest in the city should hail with joy the favorable ' conditions of the great problem, and more than that municipal regard j should shove aside personal bicker ing. Some of the press is calling atten tion to tho necessity of a new legis lative apportionment. Well, it does seem that there could be some im provement made in this direction for the representation in the legisla ture, to be just and equitable, should be based on population. Otherwise, it is not a representative govern ment in the full acceptation of the term. Star. Yavapai in the last election had over 4,500 voters, which represents a population of at least 15,000 people, and yet in the face of Hbe legislative evil which prevails, bur representation in the lower house is below that of Pima, which has four, and has not more than three-fourths the voters Yavapai has. Yes, a change should take place in the apportionment law. Closing Out at Cost! A. BIG
