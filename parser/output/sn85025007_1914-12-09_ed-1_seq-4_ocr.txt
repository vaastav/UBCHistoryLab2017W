BANQUET LAST NIGHT. The pulse of the city?the busii ness men?with many of their friends including Congressmen Glass, Montague and Carlin of the Virginia delegation, participated in a banquet last night at Westminster Building. It was the get-together event of Post F, Virginia Division of the Travelers' Protective Association, and was a decided success in every detail of its conception. The menu was of a most inviting nature. It was prepared and served by the members of the Aid Society of the - ? ... m 1. j Second fresoytenan u.nurui, cum bllC | attention bestowed upon each guest by the ladies was apparent, as is always the case when this organization prepares a feast. The principal speeches were made by Hon. Carter Glass and Hon. A. * J. Montague, and they were listened to with close attention. Mr. Glass, whc is the chairman of the House committee on banking and currency, j gave an , exhaustive history of the i financial workings of the country during the past half a century, in which he showed that for many years the bank deposits of the country were really in charge of one man, t.hp Cnmotroller of Treasury, who had the power to concentrate them whpve he would?generally in New York, Chicago, or St. Louis?and that danger of this was apparent^ i as panics followed from the fact J that the business and industrial por-' tioas of the country were at times | unable to secure the aid needed in carrying on the affairs of the country. He showed the practical workings of he present reserve system and the regional banks, and made tne financial question of the country one of interest to all his hearers, and not problems which the rank and file are generally unable to grasp. Mr. Glass told of the fight the administration had to put up in order to thwart the attempts of interested men and sections to continue the impractical and illogical banking system of by-gone years, and gave all tfhe credit to President Woodrow Wilson, whose wisdom had conceived and brought about present conditions under which there need be no fears of panics. Under present laws the Comptroller of the Currency has six associates, and it is no longer in his power to allow any one section of the country lo corner all the capital. ivir. Montague, who has so often enthused Alexandria audiences, in his speech made many interesting suggestions, especially in reference to the plans for a more equitable taxav lion in Virginia., According to his j convictions^ the segregation plan is j the most logical, and ho gave his reasons therefor^ Under it all would ho rftade to bear their share of the public burdens. Mr. Montague's speech took a wide range. He referred to his visits to Alexandria on other occasions, showed the advisability of the people living closer to each other, referring especially to President Wilson's procedures in reading his messages to representatives of the people, and among other things predicted that the time would come when the heads of departments would have seats in Congress where they could make suggestions concerning what measures should be adopted to perfect their respective departments. % The drafters of the constitution of the late Southern Confederacy realised the importance of this, as under it the members of the cabinet had seats upon the floor of Congress to urue the needs of their departments. THE PRESibiEr^T :'* ; "'i: AM) THE AiAKMISTS. Congressman Montague in his speech last night at the banquet of #' the Travfelefs' Protective Associa-1 tion wisely suggested that the people i of a country should study political economy, as by so doing good men would aid in forming good governments instead of bad which is so often the case when citizens refuse j to vote or interest themselves in; what is going- oh in the political | world. Since the war broke out in Eu- j rope some people, like the A then- j iaus of old, with their ears wide j open to hear something new or to. st&rt something new, have become j delirious wilh the notion that the ; Lnited States, from a military or naval point of view, is as helpless as China, and that many millions of j dollars should be spent immediately in armaments. And with such lavish j expenditures military laws similar to , those which have so distressed Eu- j ropean countries should be enacted j in the United States in order that the young men be made to spend a large portion of their manhood drilling, sleeping in barracks and playing soldiers. Members of the Virginia delegation in the Senate and House have very properly termed all such delu-1 sons ''tommyrot," an<i their wise ( observations have been confirmed by j President Wilson, who fortunately^ j holds the ribbons at this time when j some misguided spirits would met- [ amorphose the picture of 'Uncle Sam'I i into a fierce son of Mars encased in ! arm or. The President in his message to j Congress yesterday said: "Let there 'be no misconception; the | country has been misinformed. We i have not been negligent of national j defense. We are not unmindful of i the great responsibility resting upon ! us. We shall learn and profit by the : lesson of every experience and every ! new circumstance; and what is need- i ' i eu will be adequately done." ( He further calls attention to the j fact that the country has never been ; found unprepared for eventualities, j 0 j 

ELKS MEMORIAL SERVIICE j (Continued from page one) fraternal activities to forget thejiv, j ! selves for an hour and follow to the j | grave all that was mortal of their | brother an<j to take steps to assure j that his memory, too, will be kept I green. "The Elks is not a religious order," j said Mr. Barrett. "Men of all creeds, j Catholic. Protestant, Jew and Gentile ; alike place their hands on the same > | Bible and take the solemn pledges j that make them brothers, all. i "Atheism, the speaker pointed out. I ''has gone of fashion. There is no j longer the man who defies a God, 1 but there are many who will say: | Vps T ,hf?1ieve in God. but not aj [ personal God, who concerns himself j with the small things in my life, j Against this latter class, as well as the former, the Elks stand as a bul- i wark. They believe and they teach that there is a personal God and that he acts as a personal father. | "To the question of Cain," the! speaker said, "Elks answer: I am j my brother's keeper." . "And then, the speaker continued^ J "the Elks is a social order. Social in- j tercourse, he said, is good. It devel- j ops the best there is in men and no-j where will the quitter show his true I character quicker than in his friend-: ly dealings with men under close j social condtions^ "Mr. Barrett led gracefully up to a .pretty climax when he told of how^ j in the midst of jovial festivities all; is changed when the mystic hour J of eleven arrives and every Elk pays j tribute to the "absent brother." "In concluding his address Mr. j Barrett repeated the story of a rnemDer 01 i\ew ionc i-.oage Jj ; which hinges around a handless j| clock of Elkdom. The story, retold with feeling and delicate shading, j is that a tot who designed to make j with his own hands a clock with the , hands pointing to the hour of eleven ! i as a Christmas present to his j father. *. I "It was to be a burnt wood affair ; j and he went with his mother to pur- , t chase the materials, later working j j them into the desired form with a j I great deal of patence and childish j eagerness^ And then when the "mys-: tic" figures had been guild ed and all j was ready except thP hands, the lit- j tie boy died. The father- found the token laid 1 awav and handless and it is treas- j urt*d as one of the precious memo- J rics of his boy as well as a lasting! ; symbol of the duty that every Elk ] owes to absent brother, whether ab- j sent in this world or gone to the i hereafter. "Mr. Barrett came to the city ' yesterday morning and during the j day be was called upon by scores of ] members of the local, lodge, to the! majority-pf whom-'^.ii'not a stran- J ger. ' Those'--who heard his "address yesterday unhesitatingly pronounced ; it one of the most graceful efforts ever made on a similar* occasion j here." i " '
