CORD (ULTiVATIOII IMPORTANT CONTEST CLOSES IN LINCOLN 120 BUSHELS RAISED ON ACRE Some Valuable Hints by Harry W Olderosr, Second Prize Winner The corn contest which clos ed at Lincoln Neb November 20, was a great success. About 150 Neb. boys competed for the first prize of $50. This was a warded to a young man who raised 119 buhsels and 20 pounds on an-acre of ground. Harry W. Olderog of Gretna, Neb who captured the second prize of $40, raised 118 bushels and thirty pounds on his acre. He is a member of the Boys Agri cultuarl club, and is greatly in terested in matters pertaining to farming. He writes the follow ing interesting article on his method ot preparing the ground for a prize crop: The ground on which I raised my corn for the contest was se lected and prepared in the fol lowing manner: I selected a piece of black loam soil that had been in pas ture for five years, and was lo cated along a small ravine, thus getting apiece of soil that has received rich deposits daring the freshets of the past few years. Also the rich alluvial soil as it was washed from the adjoining hillsides. The ground was plowed during the early spring, about six inches deep, and allowed to remain as it was turned over until time to plant, thus allowing the soil to receive he early spring rains also to allow the air to circulate freely through the surface soil, and hasten decomposition of grass roots, etc. About the middle of May I harrowed the ground twice, following the same way as I plowed it, in order to har row the upturned sods down ward rather than turning them with the grass surface upward and retarding deoomposition. Next I went out onto the field with a disk and disked it twice crosswise, thus chopping the heavy sods to a fine soil. But upon a close examination I found the under soil to be quite coarse and not packed suffi ciently close to allow the under ground water to be carried to the surface by capillarity, also that in planting the crop some of the seed would fall into these hollows and not have a perfect seedbed to rest in, so I rolled the field carefully with a heavy roller to in are a full-packed seed bed. I harrowed it again to be sure of a perfect surface mulch and then I considered the field ready for planting. The field was new and I thought it unnecessary to add any fertilizer, so none was used whatever. I carefully '. watched the ground and. tested it daily in regard to temperature and moisture, and found it to be in good condition for planting the ft UNION Kttaluhed in 1886. 17th day of May, temperature ranging in different parts be tween 65 and 70 degrees F. After the corn had been planted several days I found the ground to be drying out quite rapidly, so I harrowed it again to pre serve a good surface mulch, thus checking evaporation and hastening the growth of the young sprouts. In a few days days after I harrowed the field the corn came up nicely and every stalk seemed to be large and healthy. The weather continued dry, so I turned into the field the cultivator and gave it a thorough cultivation thus forming a deeper surface mulch and at the same time stir ring the soil around the corn and makine it more available for plant food. A few days af ter I had cultivated the crop for the first time we had a heavy rain, thus packing tee soil quite hard, so as soon as the surface was sufficiently dry to warrant it, I entered the field and culti vated it again, to prepare the surface mulch so that a large portion of the rain might be re tained in the soil to ward off the drouth which was prophesied by many of the farmers. The same method was followed during the remainder of the growing sea son, but I was very cautious during the last cultivation to plow very shallow and at quite a distance from the corn to guard against injuring the corn roots which were then extend ing across the entire row. The last cultivation was more to prepare a good surface mulch and kill a few small weeds which were sprouting rather than hill ing up the corn or attempting to cut out any large weeds which might be found standing near the corn. I took great pains to keep the field free from suckers, as this proves great injury to the corn, and especialty would this have been true had the season been a dry one.—World Herald. Railroad Men Leave. Following the closing up of tracklaying work on the lines of the Milwaukee and the North western there is a marked exo dus of railroad men from the city this week. Probably 200 or more will go south or east this week, but they are all or nearly so on a contract to re turn in the spring and resume work. There is, in consequence, a temporary lull in the rush of railroad activity. Don't Stop for Snow Despite the late storm, the land seekers from the east are arriving daily from the south and also overland from the east. All these late arrivals is the straw which indicates the direction of the wind for next year. The people are coming our way, and there is no head ing thetti off. There is a hand writing upon the wall that tells the future of Rapid City, and there is something added to the inscription daily. Insurance Office Opened H. W.

This is a decrease of $250,000 from last year but unavoidable delays in the completion of a number of mills that would have increased the output, has held the figures down. Most of the delay mentioned above is in the arrival of ma chinery for the plants that were expected to have been in opera tion this summer. The figures given above will be increased before the year is out as they include merely the estimates of the managers of various prop erties in the Hills and do not take into account probable out put from any property that ex pects to have a mill in opera tion before the year is out nor the generally recognized activ ity during the past month that has undoubtedly a bearing on the annual figures which were comdiled by Mr. Treweek some weeks ago and which are just made public.

Lack of water is being looked upon as serious and is hamper ing the development of the mineral industries of the hills. The report recommends amend ments to the present laws re garding safety devices in mines, to make them more specific in thier terms. It asks for a law re quiring heavy wire screens a round cages when they are be ing carried in or out of the shafts, and also asks for a specfic law in regard to handling and thaw ing dynamite.

Return engagement of the fa mous Hunt Stock Company in three of their greatest successes, December 10, 11 and 12. The opening play will be ''The Music Master's Ward. What the Lead Call says of this great play: "The standard of the plays produced at the Deadwood theatre by the Hunt Stock Co., has been above the average,and the last production,"The Music Masters Ward," which was put on in such an admirable man ner last night, was a winner. The Music Master's Ward is a comedy drama, and the situa tions are so natural, so near to life and are totally devoid of strained, artificial construction. Mr. Burnham, the music mas ter, received a great ovation af ter his wonderful scene in the third aet, and such a finished piece of acting has never been seen before in the Hills. Jane Hampton, as the music masters ward, did an exceptionally strong piece of emotional act ing. The other honors of the piece were divided equally bt tween Mr. Cotton, Mr. Fisher, Mr. Conoughy, Mr. Howard, all of whom had ecoptionaliy interesting parts. The pla^ was handsomely mounted and thoroughly enjoyed by every one." ft. jg*e ~n Ifnum foil ifll Stiff
