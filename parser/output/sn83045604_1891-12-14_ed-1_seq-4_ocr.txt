SEATTLE, MOyTtAT. VEC. 14. TBE REPLY Of CHILE. The reply to the message of President Harrison issued by the Chilean minister of foreign affairs is somewhat extraordin ary. It is not in the line of diplomatic correspondence. It is not in answer to any note or demand from our govern ment. It is simply a criticism of the president's message, in which the govern ment of Chile undertakes to question the facts set forth by President Harrison and to defend its own position. It is not in the form of a diplomatic note to our gov ernment. or to any government, but is furnished to the various Chilean repre sentatives in order that they may have it published. The object of this note is obvious. Presi dent Harrison in his message, and Secre tary Tracy in his annual report, place Chile in a very unfavorable light. The Chilean government cannot answer these * papers directly, and takes the present in direct method of doing so in order to counteract the effect which the message and the report of the secretary of the navy would naturally have on the opinion of the world. The government of Chile is bold because it knows that the House of Ilepresenta tives is politically hostile to the president and believes that it would effectually tie liis hands, if in his judgment it should be come necessary to assort the dignity and uphold the honor of the nation. THE IXCAfAULE 

ENTHUSIAST. The incapable enthusiast is an omni present tigure in politics. There is not any exact periodicity in the arrival and departure of the incapable enthusiast, as there is in the Might of locusts. He comes rather with the effective, sudden unex pectedness of the rats that in vast armies sometimes move over the face of Scandi navia, or the white ants that in a freakish mood make a dreaded forced inarch over certain districts of Africa. There is no stopping the march of the Norway rats; they go on until they reach the sea and perish amid general thanksgiving, as did the herd of swine that possessed with the devil rubhed into the sea of Galilee and perished. It is very much bo with the irruption of the incapable enthusiast. There is no •topping hira; he does no good; he makes a deal of social mischief, and every capa ble man, whether an enthusiast or not, is very thankful when the incapable enthu siasts are either drowned in the sea of their own expectoration or die of moral and mental epilepsy, delirium tremens or St. Vitus dance. Sometimes the incapable enthusiast is Father McGlynn or Henry George, gravely proposing to abolish poverty by legislation. Sometimes lie is a "labor reformer," who would have a part nership between labor and capital, in which labor shall dictate its Own wages, control the management, share in the profits, while it magnanimously provides that capital shall bear all the losses. Some times the incapable enthusiast is a Robespierre or St. Just, a sort of political Doctor Sanerado, who thinks the only way to restore a sick state to life is to bleed it to death by cutting ofTthe head of every man, woman and child that does not agree with you; sometimes he is a dyna miter who thinks the true way to har monize English rule in Ireland is to blow up the Tower of London on a holiday, when it is full of innocent, irresponsible visiting English women and children. Sometimes the incapable enthusiast is at the head of a trade union, who instructs his followers that the true way to a; ate injustice sutlered at the hands of Employer Peter is to mob and main Employe Paul, who in order to get his bread has accepted the work and the wages that Employe Peter rejected with contempt. Sometimes the incapable enthusiast is a Bellamyite, who exterminates the poverty that is inci dental to individualism by the erection of the Utopian machinery of communism, which reduced to successful practice would mean a state of social tyranny as dismal ami destructive of spiritual growth or free Independent manhood as that of Sparta under Lvcurgus. Sometimes the incapable enthusiast is a Chibago anarchist ; a human mad bull that la crazy enough to suppose that he can undertake to pore liberty under law with his horns. toss in it the air and then pro ceed to trample the life out of it without getting shot like a runa way Texas steer by a policeman. Sometimes the incapable enthusiast is the whooping crane of the Farmeis'Alli ance party, trying to as the Ameri can eagle, and screaming for free silver coinage, the sub-treasury scheme and other new but dishonest schemes to pay old debts. The incapable enthusiast assumes as m*ny shape* as Proteus, but his distin guishing ear-mark has been faithfully de scribed as a uniform indifference to moral consideration*, and among the whole tri'>e of incapable enthusiasts no one is more conspicuous for this insensibility to moral considerations than that most incorrigible of incapables, the "third party'' Prohibi tionist, who stands up and disingenu ously denounces the high license law as a "delusion and a snare,'' when a.l au thentic, authoritative testimony shows that, while no leg. >l. it ion ever sobered a man incapable othrrw ise of his own salva tion, high license has something let ter abated the a&loon nuisance In Mmnes -ta, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Massachusetts than prohi bition. Under high license the low. secret liquor dives frequented by the "subter ranean savages of civilization" are meas urably obliterated, whiie they increase and multiply like rabbits in Australia un der prohibition. In the face of the fact that high license does weed out the worst and most noisome liquor saloons, the in capable enthusiast stands up in Maine on Monday and denounces the Republican party as a "rura party" that has made prohibition incapable of enforcemeent, and on Tuesday rises up in wrath to give the lie to anybody who takes Neal Dow at his word and says that prohibition fails to prohibit. The incapable enthusiast, as a third party Prohibitionist, denounces both par ties as a lies of the rum power, and yet loses no opportunity to help into power in New York and New Jersey the Demo cratic party that not only refuses to pro hibit, but as a rule declines to place the liquor trafQc under even moderate regula tion and restraint. He includes in his list of the foes of temperance, a cause which surely needs the help of all its friends, not only those who believe in high license, but those who, believing in prohibition, decline to be third party Prohibitionists. The incapable enthusiast, with vulgar and vituperative speech, describes the saloon as a swill cart and denounces the capable enthusiast, who declines to be a third party Prohibitionist.as its driver, "fhe third party Prohibitionist is always incapable, if not always an enthusiast. He is sometimes nothing better than a prohibition dema gogue, a temperance charlatan, merely flippant when he is not absolutely foolish and shallow, a pettifogger in argument, an elusive and d elusive debater of the sort that make the judicial grieve and life a burden to the sane friends of humanity. The third party Prohibitionist holds that "every minister and teacher who refuses to vote for prohibition is ruled by the liquor interest," which is as gross and ig norant an insult to thousands of upright, abstemious men as it would be to argue that a man who refuses to vote for celibacy, because of bastardy, or the exist ence ot filthy vices, was a rake and a roue. 

GOVERNOR HILL'S 81'EICH, The speech delivered by Governor Hill at Elmira, N. Y., December 5, is an at tempt to furnish the Democratic party with a policy and a platform upon which victory can be obtained in 1892. If the party accepts this policy and platform of Governor Hill it will doubtless place Hill upon the platform as its candidate. With characteristic audacity and cunning Gov ernor Hill declines to accept the views of Mills, Carlisle, Vest, Cleveland & Co., and relegate the silver coinage question to the background for the present and bring the tariff issue to the front. He argues that the free coinage element in the Dem ocratic party is too strong at the South and West to permit the silver question to be put aside, if not strong enough to force a declaration in favor of free coinage next year, bo he boldly declares'in favor of making the campaign of 1892 on the issue* of the tariff and the currency. On the silver question he attempts to satisfy both the free coinage Democrats of the South and West, and the New York and Massachusetts Democracy that as sumed strong ground against free silver coinage. Governor Hill would have free coinage of both gold and silver, and he would have the silver dollar equal in "in trinsic value" to the gold dollar. His test of "intrinsic value" is bullion value, and he would have a gold dollar's worth of bullion in every silver dollar. Every friend of honest money in the country is with Governor Hill up to this point, but every friend of honest money must part company with him when he defines how he would bring this about, for Governor Hill holds with the ultra free coinage ad vocates that free coinage would at once ad vance the price of silver to par with gold, that is to $1.29, or over an ounce. His words are that "free bimetallic coinage will of itself re-establish the an cient and unvarying equality" of gold and silver. This assumption of Governor Hill has already been disproved. Under the law of July 14. ISW, the secre tary of the treasury has purchased since August 13, during the fiscal year. 48,393,113 ounces of silver bullion, at an average cost of $1,045 per ounce. The highest price paid during the year was $1.2025 and the lowest 0.9G30. The lowest price of silver reached during the fiscal year was 0.9636, on April 2, 1891, but on November 1 tho market price was only o.9t>, which would give to the silver dollar a bullion value of 74 cents. Before the influence of the pros pective silver legislation was felt in the market silver was worth in New York about 0.975 per ounce. President Harrison in his message re cites these facts and says: Tho ablest advocates of free coinape In the la>t congress were most confident In thoir pre d.ctions that th* purchase* by the government, required by the law, would at once briiijj the pr.<e of stiver to per ounce, which would make the bullion value of a dollar 100 cents and hold it there- The friends of free silver «re uot agreed. I think, as to the cau*es that brought their hopeful predictions to nausfht. S<mie facts are known. The exports of silver to and from London to Ind.a durinsr the first nine months of the calendar year fell off over 50 per cent., or |i:i.2iiJ.73o. compared with the same months of the preceding year. The export of domestic Si4\-er bullion from this country, which has averaged for the last ten years over 117,000,000, In the last fi>cal year was 113,797,7'j1; while for the fits: time in recent years the imports of sil ver into this country exceeded the exports by the sum of $J,710,160. In the previous year the net expert* of silver fr >m the I'nlted Kates amounted to >\'.-45,"s>V Trie production of the Cnited j-tates increased from 50,000,000 ounces in ISS9 to 6&,500,000. The government is now buying end putting annually 0i.00u.000 ounces, which, allowing 7,140,000 ounces of net bullion used in the arts, is 6,610.000 more tnan our domestic product available for coinage These facts make it perfectly plain that the moment silver began to rise under the increased purchases and retirement frjm the market of silver by the government Europe commenced to dump silver upon us and broke the attempted "corner" of the free silver coinage theorists. So Gov ernor Hill's plan to equalize the gold dol lar and the silver dollar under free coinage rests on the fog bank of the ultra silver coinage men, which has already been burnt out under the tierce light of experi ence. Governor llill clearly believes in free coinage of silver, but he throws a sop to the Eastern Democrats, who are not only utterly oppose ! to free silver coinage, but to any further coinage of silver with out an international agreement as to the ratio between gold and silver, by advising that free silver coinage be approached •lowly; he would not advise its immediate enactment, lie advises the Democrats m congress not to pass any free silver coinage till this winter because the president would veto it, but urges the THE

On the subject of the tariff Governor Hill is clearly not with Miiis, Carlisle, Cleveland <t Co., for he contents himself with urging the Democracy to repeal the McKinley law and restore the law of ISB3. which was a Republican tariff. His platform for 1892 is simply the repeal of the McKinley tariff and the currency issue as set forth in the New York Democratic platform of this year. Governor Hill is a "smart" politi cian, but he is not an able statesman or he would see that while as a bid for the Democratic nomination in ISP2 his speech is ingenious, it is utterly worthless to capture the country with; for the New York Times, Springfield Republican. Bos ton Herald and New York Evening Post, who correctly voice the opinions of the honest dollar Democracy of New York and New England, treat his solution of the silver question with contempt, as nothing better than the practical advocacy of free silver coinage. Of th is portion of his speech the New York Evening Post says: Governor Hill'a speech oa bimetallsm at El mira last evening would seem to be the product of one who has lost his wits, if we did not know that a great many men who are perfectly sane "wander in their minds" on this question, s.m ply because they arc not familiar with the his tory and underlying principles of the subject. Mr. Hill is not crazy, but if he had charge of the national finances everybody else would be so very soon. While Hill's speech would be fatal to his electioa in 1&92, it is quite likely to give him the Democratic nomination. His position on the tariff is conservative compared with that of Mills, and his at tempt to give a free silver coinage inter pretation to the Saratoga platform of the New York Democracy will probably satisfy the West and the South that on the cur rency question Gocemor Hill is with them at heart. Governor Hill has made a shrewd, artful bid for the presidential nomination, but he is discredited forever with those intelligent Eastern Democrats who know that his assumption has al ready been disproved by experience, and these honest dollar Democrats, while they believe with Cleveland in the absolute sus pension of silver coinage and all further purchases of silver bullion, nevertheless prefer the breakwater of the act of July, 1890, to the unresisted flood of free silver coinage which the enactment of th» financial theory of Governor Hill would mean in practice.

A PAOAJ* OF THS ALLKGHANIES. By Marah Ellis Ryan. Chicago: Hand, McNally <fc Co. For sale by W. H. Pumphrey & Co. Every new work of this powerful authoress, Maran Ellis Ryan, adds to her fame. H*r mastery of character is more like that of a man than of a woman. "A PBgan of the Alleghanies'' opens with a poem In prose, in which the writer's command of language and fund of imagery are conspicuously displayed, but belore the enC of the second chapter the author is entirely lost in the »tory. Not for a moment does the reader feel the writer's presence, but Is unconsciously absorbed in a profound interest in the living people, who talk and act from perfectly rational motives and retain their individuality under ail conditions. Names are unnecessary; one recog nizes their voices aud their figures, and although the dramatic climax is startlingly impre-sive, it comes about in a perfeotly unconstrained way. Most of the characters live in the remote, out-of-the-world corner, Ligonier valley, yet it is the best proof of the author's skill that the incidents of an isolated community should be so cleverly woven into a romance of adventure, passion and pathos. THE SWAN or VILAMORTA. By Emilia Pardo Btizan, author of "A Wedding Trip," "A Christian Woman," "Morrina," etc. New York: Cassell Publishing Cempany. For sale by Lowinan & Hanford. "The Swan of Vilamorta" is the story of a poet's ambition with a prosaic termination. It la written with a quiet humor that is very re freshing. Ihe translation is by Mary J. Serrano, who won much renown by her interpretation of Marie BashkirtsefFs journal, and she has evideutly performed her task with most intelli gent fidelity, as the expressions of the author, while free frotn pedantic reproduction of the Spanish idiom, are very characteristic. The life of the poet among hie sordid and commonplace surroundings is half pathetic, half humorous, and his experiences of a city are related just as they would appear to the village lad suddenly tran«ported to entirely novel but actually very woridly scenes. THAIS. By Anatole France. Translated by A. D. Hall. Chicago: NileC. Smith Publish ing Company. For sale by Lowman A Hanford. The striking characteristics of "Thais" are beauty of style, fertility of resource, and ctartliug originality in the treatment of the moraentuous problems of morality. "Thais" presents a maaterly resume of the various philosophies which are skillfully con trasted with the tenets of the early church. In subject it suggests, although it does not re semble, Klngsley's "Hypatia." The plot is simple, the interest well sustained, the style brilliant. "Thais" is directly in line with the tendency of modern thought, and will afford delight to the thoughtful reader. —H. L. Qot den. S2 Halter Block. THE SHADOW OP SHAME. By Austyn Gran ville. Chicago: Charles H. Sergei. A very extonded anticipatory notice of "The Shadow of Shame" has already appeared in these columns, and it is necessary cow only to aav that the promise held out is amply fulfilled. The romance is worked out with wonderful clearness, the secret of the plot being that two sisters lead entirely different live*, aud the com plications which sustain the interest depend upon the similarity of appearance between the two women. It Is sensational, it is true, but the characters are boldly drawn and the incidents natural though dramatic. THE LADY or THE LKNS. By Frank Carleton Long. Illustrated. Chicago: L. E. C'randall "The Lady of the Lens" is a story atising from an incident in the civil war, wherein the her first sees the heroine from a point of military observation, through a telescope. The quaiut nes*oi the titie is borne out by the novelty of tne plot. In a recent reference to Frank B. Carpenter's picture I fell into the error of supposing that he had painted the Geneva b <ard of arbitrat on. I had not seen the picture when I wrote that par agraph. I was preseut last week at the dinner given in honor of Mr. Carpenter, when the pictuae wa- publicly exhibited for the first time. Mr. Carpenter's historic picture is the group of distinguished gentlemen who arranced tho treaty oi Washington aud made the settlement at Geneva Dossible. It is a great work. It is always difficult to present a group of men at table without making at least oue-half the per sons appear a* though they had si ecialiv posed for the picture. La Vinci, in bis celebrated pic ture. "The 1 jvst supper." avoided this obstacle by placing every tody on the sume side 01 the tatiie. T:ie two figures in the forepart of Mr. Carpenter's picture—Justice Nelson aud secre tary Fi»h—are quite strong.

I observed that the only arti-t« who were present to do honor to their brother artist on th'.s menaoraole occasion were Daniel Huntington. Eastman Johnson and Thomas M. Wood. president of the Academy of Design. Were those the only artists in vited or did jealousy keep »ome of the brethren away? I cannot think so, for a lovelier, sweeter, rn <re modeat man than Mr. Carpenter never wielded a brush. When Eastman Johnson was complimenting the picture at the close of the dinner. Mr. Carpenter grasped him by the hand ar.d. with tear* a.most streaming in his e»es, exclaimed: "Oh, if 1 could only taint as yon paint how proud I would be!"

A stock paragraph—which might as well be stereotyped, or kept standing for insertion whenever there is space to fill—goes the rounls of the entire press of the country once in six weeks or so, ab">ut the enormous wealth of'the multi-millionaires of this metropolis. The usual formula is about this: Rockefeller, $-50,- 000,003; Gould, |.«0,"00,000; all the Vatiderbilts. 140 ,000.000; all the Actors, $300,00 '.OOO, and so on. Sometimes one. and again another, is put at the bead of tne list, as not only the wealthiest of the lot, but as "the richest man !n America." Everyone of these crent fortunes is enormously over-astimate 1. Probably t. e them, t e Astors', amount to the ready immense sum of $1 0.0u0.k 0. At that it really is worth more than any other, very likeiy any three more for tunes put together in ;his town, because it is tangible—you can put your finger on it and see it. since it is in houses nn : other real estate of computable value, and not in wind or a r. or watered sto KS which can be called worth as many million* as the possessors choose to put on them. It is just as ea»y, for example, to say that Mr. Jay Gould is w rth $1,000,00u,000 as that he has $.00,000,<00, and it would be just as true. The smaller fortunes are likewise immensely overrated. A painfully conspicuous example came to light in the case of the estimable Cyme W. Field, who haa been rated at from $15,000,000 to to $-'5,000,000, and yet his noble sacrifice of $2,000,U00 on jto meet the deficiencies or defal cations of his son is said to have "swept away his entire fortune." There is scarce y a week but when some young woman ia paraded in the "society" columns aa "having in her own right" anywhere from $10,000,000 to $30,000,000; yet, when she marries, her entire fortune just about suffices to furuish ths_Hat in which she and her husband begin married life.
