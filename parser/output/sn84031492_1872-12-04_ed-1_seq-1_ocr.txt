The Tributes of the Two Senators to the Memory of Horace Greeley. . Ward Hunt, of New York, Appointed to the Supreme Court, The Administration Organ on Banks, Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune, SENATORIAL PROSCRIPTION. Washington, Dec 3.—The Senate to-day indi cated that, so far as the majority is concerned, it is able to carry the spirit of proscription even beyond the grave. The Chaplain of tho Senate opened the proceedings this forenoon with a beautiful prayer in favor of reconciliation and harmony among tho representatives of the peo ple, especially now that the hand of God had touched the leader of one of the great parties in the last Presidential contest. Scarcely had the Chaplain ceased, when Simon Cameron arose, and. asking that tho reading of tho minutes be dispensed with, moved an adjournment forth with. The object of this unexpected move was bnt too plainly apparent. The Republican caucus, which met at 10 o’clock in the morning, had taken into consideration the advisability of adjourning over in respect to Horace Greeley, And had decided that, while the Senate was perfectly willing to adjourn, it was out of no such tender consideration. Senator Fenton begged Mr. Cameron to allow him to offer his resolution providing for an ad journment over the day of the funeral, especial ly as both himself and Senator Snnmer desired to submit a few brief remarks, but Cameron would not give way, and by a rising vote his motion to immediately adjourn was- largely car ried. Senator Fenton would not have pressed this motion at all had he not consulted with a large number of Bepublican Senators, who assured him that his resolutions were eminently in order, and that they would support them. WHAT SUMNER AND FENTON WOULD HAVE SAID. As showing the brief and nnpartisan character of the remarks which both Senators Sumner and Fenton would have made, if they had no been so unceremoniously cut off, their speeches were written out in advance, as given[below. Senator Sumner would simply have spoken as follows: . Ono word if you please. A funeral will tni™ place to-morrow, on which the eyes of the nation will resL while innumerable hearts will be filled with grief, and the people everywhere learn the instability of life and the commandment of charity. It is proper, therefore, for the Representatives of the Nation to susuendlabor, that they, too, may be penetrated by the lesson of the day. More for lesson than tor the illustrious dead is this needed. He is gone beyond any earthly r*ii. Wo remain. Duties are always for the living, and now, standing at the open grave of Horace Greeley, we are admonished to forget the strifes of par ty, and to remember only truth, country, and man kind, to which his honest life was devoted. In other days the horse and armor of the departed chieftain have been buried in the grave where ho reposed. So, too. may we bury the animosities, if not the badges, of the past. Then, indeed, will there be victory for the dead which all will share. SENATOR FENTON’S TRIBUTE. Senator Fenton would have said: 1 desire to leave for New York at 1 o’clock, and, therefore, venture upon the indulgence of the Senate to make a motion at it has reference to the great bereavement wo all so deeply feel, in the death of Horace Greeley, Tine sad event touches the hearts of all our people. Not only in our land, hut the struggling and the good in all lands, of whatever rank or condition, will unite in deep and long lament over hia death. ‘ As a further, public recognition of an event eo impressive, of a grief so universal and pro found, 1 move that when the Senate adjourns to-day, it adjourn to meet on Thursday next. I may remark that several Senators desire to attend the funeral, and it is seml-officially announced that the President and Vice President of the United States will leave for New York to-day for the same purpose. don’t like it. The Administration organ here does not like the way in which Congress yesterday refused to accept Banks’ feaignation of the Chairman ship of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It says this morning, “ The action of the House in declining to receive the resignation of General Banks was due entirely to Democratic votes. This should not be taken as an indication that the other gentlemen who made themselves conspicuous by vilifying the Administration, from the President down, are to be treated in a like manner. We do not believe that the House of Representatives is prepared to give _ its seal of approval to the retention of the Chairman of the Committees on Claims and Post Office, and Post Eoada. The resident 

CHICAGO RFT.TEV Committee held a meeting here last evening, and adopted a resolution to the effect that when the Mayor of that city sent his requisition, this city would pay over the balance of $27,000 accorded to the benefit of Chicago. CHOCKTAW COTTON. The Department of Agriculture has to-day received from Major T. D. Griffith, United States Agent for the Choctaws and Chickasaws, several samples of cotton, grown ffifs year by the members of those tribes in the southern part of the Indian Territory. Through the efforts of the President of the Cotton Asso ciation, the Missouri State Fair at St. Louis ex tended its premium list to the Indian Territory, and the Inmans were induced to exhibit a num ber of bales there, which, as will as the exhibitors themselves, attracted much attention. Among the samples are three which secured premiums of 

SSOO, 8250, and 6100, respectively; also one exhibited by Allen Wright, former Governor of the Choctaw Nation, but too late to compete. A greatly in creased interest has been created among those people in the prodution of cotton, and it is be hoved that much larger crops will result from these well directed labors. CREDIT MOBUJEB, Judge Jeny Black, counsel for McCoinh, in the suit of the latter against the Credit Mobilier, m response to a telegram from General Garfield! arrived here to-day. Early in the day he held a long consultation -with Hr. Dawes in the room of the Committee on Ways and Means. It was stated, to-day, that it was pro posed to put General Banks, who is a member of the Committee on Investigation, on the stand, for the purpose of proving that he was approached by representatives of Sie Credit MobUier with offers of stock for his influence. The Investigating Committee held an informal meeting to-day, simply for tho|purpose of organ izing. ° THE GREELEY ECNEEix,. Twenty Democratic membera of Congress left here to-night to attend the funeral of Mr Greeley m New York, to-morrow. Senators Fenton, Tipton, Schurz, and Trumbull will also be present on this sad occasion. On the Dart of the Administration, the President Vice Pres ident, and Vice President-elect, witi Secretary Boutwell, left to-night. J THE 

CENSUS. 0 CHICAGO, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1872, Secretary’s”! recommendation Trill be approved and the money voted. Among other subjects to be illustrated, besides those above mentioned will be the location of the great manufacturing and mining industries ; the range of cultivation of each of the great agricultural staples, and the prevalence of particular forms of disease. CHIVALROUS. ■When the vote was taken yesterday on the question of accepting General Banks’ resigna- as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it was noticed that the Hon. Leonard Myers not only voted “ but used his influ ence amonghisfriends to have General ‘Ranira retained. This conduct has a touch of magnan imity in it. Mr. Myers is next to General Banks on the Committee, and would, no doubt, have been made Chairman had the resignation been accepted. Mr. Hill, of New Jersey, who is second on the House Committee on Post Oflices, to-day intro duced the following bill: Be it enacted, etc., that on and after the Ist of July, 1873. postage shall be charged on domestic matter of the first class, embracing all correspondence wholly or partly in writing, except book manuscript and corrected proof sheet passing between authors and publishers, and including local or drop letters, at the uniform rate of two cents for each half ounce or frac tion thereof. Despatches have been received here to-day to the effect that Senator Spencer has just been re elected in Alabama, and Memmon. the Demo cratic candidate for Governor, has been elected in place of Poole, the present incumbent. said to-day, that to his min'd the late election had demonstrated that other people had thoughts as well as newspaper people, provid ing that other people behaved themselves. to revise the Senate Standing Committees have had a seven hours* session to-day, and find that their labors are not yet concluded. The changes thus far agreed upon are : Edmunds, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, vice Trumbull, re moved : Windom, Chairman of the Con tingent Expenses, vice Penton, removed ♦, Pratt, on Pensions, vice Edmunds, promoted • Spencer on Mines and Mining, vice Chandlerl provided for elsewhere; Plannigan, Chairman of the Pacific Railroad, vice Stewart to be otherwise provided for. Considerable trouble is found in assigning places for all the faithful ones, hence the labor of the Committee, which will be con tinued until a late hour. Schurz, it is stated, has been token from the Foreign Relations Com mittee altogether. [To the Associated Press.} 

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OP STATE. Washington, Dec. 3.— The report of the Sec retary of State on contingent expenses, shows that during the fiscal year ending with June last, the contingent expenses for foreign inter course and missions amounted to nearly $30,000; $325,000 were paid to satisfy the Hudson's Bay and Pnget Sound indemnity; $292 were paid Bancroft Davis, as bearer to England of the Alabama Treaty. The Treaty case cost $582, and the freight on it was $73. The aggregate coat of cable telegrams was $6,600. The resignation, by Associate Justice Nelson, of his judicial position, was received yesterday, addressed to the Secretary of State. The Pres ident accepted the resignation, and appointed Ward Hunt, of New York, as Judge Nelson’s successor. The nomination will be sent to the Senate to-morrow or Thursday, The appointment is received with satisfaction by those in this city who know him either per sonally or by reputation. Representative Morey of Louisiana. Chairman of the Special Committee on .the Mississippi Levees, intends bringing that subject before the House at an early day.

CAMERON moved that the Senate ad journ. Mr. FENTON asked him to withdraw the mo tion temporarily. Hr. CAMERON said he must insist upon his motion. Mr. FENTON. “ I appeal to my friend to withdraw hie motion. I wish to move that when the Senate adjourn it adjourn to meet on Thurs day.” The VICE PRESIDENT ruled Fenton’s motion not in order.

Mr. RANDALL offered a resolution calling on the Secretary of the Treasury for information as to what law authorizes him to make an increased issue of legal-tender notes, as was done in Octo ber last, and whether such issue was made in the legal-tenders heretofore retired, or in new ones. Ac. Adopted. NEW 

BILLS. A hill was introduced by Mr. MAYNARD for the relief of the State Of Tennessee. Referred. Mr. PERCE asked leave to introduce, and pat on its passage, a bill to regulate the payment of the female employes of the Government. Mr. GONGEtt objected. Mr. BECK'(Ky.) asked to be and was excused from service on the Select Committee, appointed yesterday, for the Oakes Ames investigation, on the ground that, during the recent canvass, he had expressed a decided opinion on the subject. Mr. COX . took the chair of the Speaker pro tcm % and appointed Mr. Merrick (Md.) to fill the place of Mr. Beck on the Committee. .Mr. WOOD offered a resolution calling on the Secretary of War for a copy of the report of •General Vincent, Assistant Adjutant General, on the condition of affairs in the Freedmen’s Bureau. Adopted. Mr. SCOFIELD (Pa,), from the Committee .oh Naval Affairs, reported a bill to authorize the construction of ten steam vessels of war, and appropriating $3,000j000 for that purpose. The vessels are to carry each ten or more guns, of large calibre, and the hulls are to be of iron or wood, as the Secretary of the Navy may deter mine. Mr. HALE (Maine) offered an amendment that not less than five of the ten vessels shall be constructed in private yards in the United States, under contract. Mr. RANDALL (Pa.) advocated the amend* ment. but thought the bill too loosely drawn, and left too much discretion to the Secretary of the Navy. . Mr, SCOFIELD (Pa.) replied to Mr. Randall’s strictures, arguing that the more restrictions placed on the Secretary the less security there would be to have the work properly done. Mr. POTTER (N. Y.), asked to what use these vessels are to be applied. Mr. SCOFIELD replied; To keep our squad rons full in the different seas, and for the pro tection of commerce. Mr. SHELLABARGER (Ohio), gave it as his judgment that a system ought to be initiated which would be harmonious in plan, in idea, and in ultimate consummation. He believed it wise to put upon the seas a. class of vessels that would have size, and have adaptation for the protection of commerce. He thought it wise to guard, limit, specify, and qualify the descrip tion of the ships to be built. Mr. SCOFIELD remarked that the ideas ex pressed by the gentleman from Ohio correspond ed with the purpose of the. Committee. Mr. COX (N. Y.), suggested a reduction of the number of vessels from ten to five. Mr. BANKS said that he had introduced this bill last session in anticipation of trouble with Spain, and affairs in the Gulf of Mexico had not improved since then. No one knew what might occur there any day, and it was proper to be prepared for all contingencies. Mr. POTTER inquired as to the proposed size of these vessels. Mr. SCOFIELD considered that four hundred or five hundred tons would be large enough, and did not suppose that any of them would exceed 1.000 tons. Mr. Scofield then referred to Mr. Banks as having sympathized with an effort to involve this country in a war with Spain. Mr. BANKS denied that he had over sympa thized with such efforts. He had introduced the bill because the Secretary had declared to mem bers of the House that he was afraid events had occurred in the Gulf of Mexico which would re quire the Government to be prepared to defend their commerce. * Mr. SCOFIELD said he was opposed to Mr. POSTAL BILL.

On a motion to print the voluminous document sent in by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. BROOKS made remarks as to the reckless ex travagance in the public printing. He said this House was lumbered with public documents, which were of no use, and gave notice that he would sell them all at public auction, and turn over the proceeds to the contingent fund of the House. THE FISHERIES, 1 On motion of Mr. BANKS, a bill to carry out the fishery clauses of the Treaty of Washington was made the special order for the second Tues day in January, and the House Adjourned. WALL STREET. New York financiers on the Treasury Report and Message-Review of the Ittonev, Gold, Stock, Bond, and. Fro* duce Markets* Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune. - THE MESSAGE AND REPORTS. New Yobk, Dec. 3.—On Wall street, the only points in the President's Message discussed were those relating to taxation, currency, and the postal telegraph. Some disappointment is felt because no further reduction of taxes is recommended. The President's remarks on the necessity of returning to specie payments when practicable were well received. The postal tele graph recommendation decidedly more ad versaries than friends among business men. Secretary Boutwell's desire to regulate the bank circulation at his discretion is not approved. His report is regarded as not sufficiently comprehensive. Its various proposals to further centralize the power of the Secretary of the Treasury are condemned by bankers and merchants. The recommendations of the Comptroller of the Currency are regarded as wholesome in so far as they favor a modifica tion of undue restrictions upon banking opera tions, and a qualification at least of the usury law. On the whole, both the message and Treasury report are considered less encouraging than was expected. 

STOCKS. The stock market was dull to-day, prices irreg ular, and in the main closed lower. Harlem was the exception, closing active at an advance of 4 per cent. Western Union does not seem to be supported by those identi fied with the management of the Company, and is not likely to he, until it is certain that Congress will not authorize a rival line, nor con nect the telegraph business with the Post Office Department. There is no general speculation in stocks. The recent comer in Northwestern has completely demoralized the outside public; most of the street operators have closed up their con tracts, and await a more settled market. MONET. Money ■was close to-day, and occasionally stringent; rates on call 7 1-16, with moat of the business at 1-32. Mercantile paper is quiet, at 10 to 12 per cent on choice acceptances. The inquiry from buyers is chiefly for long paper, which, at present rates, is attractive. as with .. the new year money will be easy and rates muchlower. There is nothing generally speaking to impair mer cantile credits, a large trade having been done daring the past season on a conservative basis. Foreign exchange was quiet. OOL was dull at 112%@112%. 

GOLD BOOTS. Governments were firm on email dealings. Railroad bonds ruled more active. PEODUCE. Flour was quiet and dull, but very firm for shipping extras and fancy brands of Minnesota; these are salable. Medium winter wheat extras are held with more confidence, and in some cases withdrawn from the market; superfine fairly active. The market closes steady. Wheat closes stronger for spring, and with a more active demand, chiefly for export. Winter stronger and in fair demand. Pork in demand, for new for December, at $14.00; 500 brie new for De cember sold at $14.00. Cut meats weak. Sales are reported of 1,000 smoked hams at ll@13c; 8,000 tbs pickled bellies at 7%c, 13(5)14 tbs average; and 150 fresh hams, about 10@11 lbs, at 9%c. Bacon lower; 250 boxes city long clear, on the spot, sold at 7j£c, and 100 boxes short clear for January at l%c. Lard weak. SPRINGFIELD. The Warehouse and Railroad Com* missioners—Border Jurisdiction* Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune, Springfield, HI., Dec. 3.—The Board of Rail road and Warehouse Commissioners mot in this city to-day; present, Governor Eoemer and Mr. Hammond; absent, Mr. Morgan. In conse quence of the absence of Mr. Morgan, there was no official action taken touching the usual report of the Commissioners. An informal talk was had concerning the means to be employed to detect and punish the rascality which is being developed in the warehousing of grain. No intention was given out as to what the report would contain, but it is certain that a majority of the Commissioners, as stated before in these despatches, wiH recommend that two separate Boards be created for the purposes con templated by the act creating the present one. It is thought that these recommendations will, however, be opposed by one member, of the Board, —Mr, Morgan. What his objections are to the change have not transpired. Mr. Mor gan telegraphed, to-day, asking the post ponement of the meeting for a) Jweek, but on being notified in return of the import ance of completing their report, in order that the Governor may have it before him to consid er in preparing his message, he signified his willingness to meet the Board, and arrived here to-nignt. It looks now as though the action of the Board to-morrow would be harmonious. The question of jurisdiction over the islands in the Mississippi River lying' along the border of this State has been raised, and the State cus todian of field-notes and surveys has been called upon to settle the question; but from data in his office he is unable to comply with the request. The matter will probably be brought before our next Legislature, as it is important to have a dividing lino marked. NEW 

YORK. Counting the Specie Three men Killed—Damages Awarded—Tweed’s Case-Bank President in Trouble- Compelled to Pay—murder Trials* New Toes, Dec. 3.—A number of female Treasury clerks are here for the purpose of counting the specie in the Sub-Treasury. Three laborers were buried by the caving in of a sewer excavation in Brooklyn yesterday. One was killed outright, the other two dying after being dug out. The ’Cross-town Horse Railroad Company was yesterday mulcted in $2,500 for injuries to a passenger. Tweed’s case was called in the Oyer and Ter miner Court this morning, when his counsel read a long affidavit showing that the indict ments were improperly found, and made a long argument in favor of quashing them. The ar gument was not concluded when the Court ad journed till Thursday. William Moffitt Graham, President of the Walkill National Bank of Middletown, N. Y., was held in $20,000 bail, to-day, to answer the charge of having jointly with Charles H. Horton, Cashier, defrauded the bank, by means of false entries, of some 

SIOO,OOO. Horton, it is alleged, has absconded, and Graham nla-ima to have been ignorant of his peculations. In the case of Charles T. Chester, to whom the city still owes $400,000 for putting up a fire alarm telegraph, Judge Fancher has granted a peremptory mandamus directing .'Comptroller Green to pay the money. The trial of King for the murder of O’Neil commences to-morrow, and that" of Scannellfor the murder of Donohue will begin on Friday. Death on the Sail. Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune, Madisos, Wia., Deo. 3.—Frederick Knudson, a young Norwegian, who had been attending the Lutheran College at Decorah, lowa, but became insane, and was on his way over the Portage Eailroad to the hospital here, from hiaiiome at . New Lisbon, eluded the two men having him in charge, sprang but of the car door, and fell un der and was run over bj the cars. Hs was picked up frightfully mangled, but lived nearly an hour. POLITICAL. INDIANA LEGISLATURE. Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune. SENATE. Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 3. —The Committee on the Judiciary reported, recommending the adoption of a joint resolution proposing an 'amendment to the Constitution prohibiting the payment of canal bonds. Concurred in. The Committee also reported a resolution giving married women the same rights in rela tion to holding property and making contracts as are enjoyed by unmarried women, recom mending it to be tabled. This gave rise to quite a lengthy discussion, which resulted in the con currence with the report. _ Mr. Brown then moved to amend the resolu tion by adding “ and exercise the elective fran chise,” which was lost after a little spread-eagle talk, and the resolution was again referred. All bills upon the Drainage laws were made the special order for Tuesday next. The select Committee on the Tippecanoe Bat tle Ground reported, presenting a history of the ground since the battle was fought, and recom mending that $25,000 be appropriated to keep it in repair. Concurred in. The resolution in reference to the death of Horace Greeley coming up, President Friedly and Mr. Brown delivered eloquent tributes to the memory of Mr. Greeley, and the Senate agreed, as a mark of respect, to adjourn until Thursday morning when it did adjourn, A bill was introduced, fixing the fees and sala ries of certain officers, it allows Superior Court jurors. $2:50 per day; before Justices of the Peace, sl, and all others $2; County Auditor, 

SI,BOO per year, and SSS for each 100 male inhabitants of the county over 21 years, and fees, etc., arising from the school fund; County Treasurers. $1,500 per year, and $25 for each 100 male inhabitants. A Constitutional Convention hill was intro duced by Mr. Steele, of Grant. Mr. Orr introduced a bill to regulate divorces. Parties must be hona fide residents of the State for three years.

New Orleans, Dec. 3.— The Eighth District Court, in the case of the Custom House Return ing Board vs. Hatch, Dupont, add Wharton, of the Governor’s Returning Board, held that the act of 1872 having repealed the act of 1870, which created the Returning Board, there was no Re turning Board in existence, nor could be until appointed by the proper, authorities, and hence this suit was brought in the interest of parties having no legal existence. In the case of Herron vs. Wharton, the Court referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Bovee-Herron case, and held that as Her ron never had been Secretary of State, he could have no standing in the suit at bar. Upon the rendering of these decisions, Mr. Matt, defendant’s coun sel, made a motion that the injunction in both cases be dissolved, and both suits be dismissed, on ground that under the act of 1872, repealing the act of 1870, Election law, there was no Re turning Board, and, consequently, the parties to the suit were legally dead; that in the suit of Herron vs. Wharton, the Supreme Court declared, not only that Herron never was Secre tary of State, but Bovee was entitled to that office, and therefore Herron, as clftfrrumt for the position, had no standing in Court. The injunctions dissolved and the suits dismissed. The above, given in view of the fact that in the case of Kellogg vs. Warmoth, one of the im portant points sought by the plaintiff is estab lishing the Returning consisting of Herron, Lynch, Longstreefc, and Hawkins. Longstreot and Hawkins were made members of the Board by Herron’s note. Regarding the Re turning Board, Mr. Billings, plaintiff’s counsel, in the argument to-day before Judge Durell, in the Kellogg-Warmoth case, said in the case of an abolition of the Canvassing Board it would devolve upon the Senate to appoint a new Board, but there could not be a Senate until the Re turning Board had first canvassed the ballots cast for candidates for the Senate. Hence, he claimed that the theory advanced by the defend ants that the Returning Board had been abol ished was untenable. The Court adjourned till to-morrow. THE PRESS ON THE MESSAGE. New Orleans, Dec. 3. —The Times says the message of President Grant is a sensible, un pretending, lucid, and business-like document, which cannot well be abridged.

The tone is catholic and kindly, and the recommendations are broadly national and patriotic. •' London, Dec. s.—Abstracts of President Grant’s message are published in the morning papers. The Times says it will be read with interest, although so largely devoted to domestic affairs. It is full of confident authority and placidity, and. in enjoyment of assured success, disre gards minor motives. TheDatfy News hopes that General Grant’s attention will hereafter be more occupied with the reform of the Civil Service than the acquisi tion of San Domingo. The News thmVa the people of the United States are ready for a new departure in the administration of their affairs, and the present session of Congress will be especially interesting to those who watch for indications of coming party progress.
