TWO BIQHIFIOAHr FAOTB. SamvxIi Ooupkbs, President of tho Ameri can Federation of Labor, was a sympathizer with tho condemnod Anarchists of Chicago and labored with Gov. Oolesiiy in their bo. half. It is fair to suppose that ho has a soft sldo for tho adhorento of tho red flag. T. V. Powdeiilt, General Master Workman of tho KniRhts of Labor, is resolutely op posed to tho Anarchists, and all that wworn of Anarchy. Ho has devoted his best efforts to driving this element from his order. As the Federation is gradually assuming an attitudo of rivalry to the Knights, theso are two significant facts that tho intelligent American workingman, who bellovcs in American institutions and American methods, may well bear in mind.

Somo very sensible measures for tho ameli oration of tho condition of the journeymen barbers of the oountry oro proposod in the Convention at Buffalo. The wielding of the professional razor would appear to bo a perennial joke, accord ing to the funny papers. But, as n matter of fact, tho barbers oro one of tho most over worked as well as the most useful classes in tho community. It is certainly a vory roasonablo proposi tion that their work should be limited to eighty-six hours per weok, and that tho provalont custom of boarding with bossos should bo abolished. Let tho barbers form thoir union, adopt a good approntico system, arrange for arbitra tion of disputes, and insist on fair treatment in the matter of wages and hours. They have tho sympathy of every man to whoso creature comforts they so deftly administer. Mr. Hatnks, tho Maino moinbor of tho Re publican National Commlttoo, says if that State goes Republican or Democratic ono year it is pretty apt to go the same way tho next year. But ho regards New York as " differ ent" and " moro changeable." Somo pooplo are novor satisflod. An unbroken serioB of Democratic victorios for six years certainly has tho aspect of regularity. Tho better France's now President is known tho better Republican ho appears to bo. Ho did not oanvass for a slnglo vote. Tho office sought tho man. Moroovor, ho said ho would accopt no election that de pended in any degroo on nionarohlal votes.

His eyes were sunken in his head, and his whole ap pearance gave evidonco of tho mentalstrug gle that he haB endured since he deliberately gavo the girl he betrayed the poison which she innocently drank and which caused her death. From that timo until the present tho pris oner has had hut little peace of mind. According to his own story, try as ho would, he could not escapo the tortures of remorso. No matter what expedients ho re sorted to, drink or dissipation of any kind, the result was always the same. He could novcr rest. Walking or while at work, awake or asleep, his crime was ever in his thoughts. Ever, as he says in explanation of his sur render, tho spirit of tho murdered girl roue beforo him. Ho saw her just as he left her on that fatal night. There sho sat in the old fushioned kitchon chair which sho was so wont to ocoutiy during his visits. Even tho glass containing tho sediments of tho deadly mixturo seemed at her elbow, and tho faco, which in lifo was always pretty nud happy, appeared beforo him palo, appealing and accusing. In his sleep he saw her. Tho spirit seemed to hover around his bed. Ho would wake in the middle of the night with perspiration rolling down his face, and then the figure would disajMiear. Rut the moment he sought rest it would return and haunt him. This lasted for months. His face become pale and careworn. His companions no ticed the change and wondered at it, as well as at his forced merriment. Then in place of an occasional drink he took many. His position, which ho strove hard to keep, was lost. lie found compan ions in barrooms and among tho Idwest classes, and in thoir midst sought in vain to drown his haunting thoughts. Finally, so desperate did he become that for weeks, according to the statement of a friend of his sister's, the young man never drew a sober breath. Then, when at last the strain seemed unbearable, he determined to acknowledge his guilt.
