GENERAL GRESHAM ON POSTAL TELEG RAPHY. The report of Postmaster- General G resham on the postal telegraph proposi tion is a surprise to the country. It was thought he would make some positive recommendation. Bat he carefully re frains from doing so, though he sets forth an argument establishing the power of the Government to establish a postal telegraph, and completely refutes the position taken by Dr. Norvin Green on constitutional grounds. Perhaps Central Gresbam is wise politically in not committing the Ad ministration, so far as his department is concerned, to any certain scheme. The Democracy has control in Congress, and upon it let tho responsibility fall of re sponding to or refusing the demand of the people for transmission of postal intelli gence by telegraph. The General setß forth in brief each of the several plans pro posed, to wit : acquisition of existing lines by the Government ; construction of new lines by the Government ; creation of a company by which lines of telegraph are to be run to each State Capital and other places, that company for privileges granted to tram-Tilt postals fur stamps ailixed at agreed rates. In response to the consti tutional objection the General clearly shows that the Government has the power under the post-road clause and the author ity to regulate commerce between the States, and to make laws necessary to carry expressly-granted powers into execu tion, to introduce a postal tel egraph system as a part of the general postal system. Forty years »go a committee of the House reported that the improved means of communica tion might be lev- fully availed of by Con gress, and as late as 1375 a House .Ju diciary Committee arrived at the same con clusion. So, too, the Supreme Court of the United States in Pcnsecola Telegraph Company vs. Western Union Telegraph Company, held that the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution were not limited to the means of postal communica tion known at the time of the grant, but that they must be held to keep pace with the country, and extend from horse and rider to the stage coa:h, to the steamer and to the rail-car, and now to the tele graph. The General reaches the conclu sion that Congress has the power to en gage the telegraph in the work of mail transportation. lie reaches the sam c point attained in that respect by Mr. Hubbard in his recent exhaustive paper on the ques tion in the North American Review. Even independently of the Act of July, lS.*"t>, tbe Government has the power, says the Post- General, to exercise the right of "eminent domain and appropriate property 'ia enable it to perform its proper function.". From the rarlieit times it has been con ceded that Congress possesses the power to absolutely prohibit the carriage of letters on post roads or parallel thereto, and so if it (hould adopt the telrgrr.ph as a branch of the p.rttal system, it could prohibit all competition. Tho Supreme Court has held that the telegraph is an instrument of commerce, and as such (abject to tho regulating power of Congress. It bears the same relation to commerce as a curier of mesbages that the railroad com pany docs as a carrier of packages. To carry out any of tho plans proposed, says the General, will involve a vast outlay of money and the engagement of a multitude of employes, and thus add largely to the patronage of the Government. Any in crease of that patronage beyond what is absolutely necessary is to be deprecated, as it is one of the dangers that menaces the purity and duration of our institutions. He asks the question if in times of great political turmoil there would not be dan ger of the line* being selfishly used for -partisan purposes by the dominant party ! But if they could be kept entirely free from such control, be says he would still hesitate to advise that - the United States should become tho pro prietor of lines and operate them by their agents. As to the chartering of a com pany, as suggested by some, to carry mes sages on contracts with the postal depart ment, that plan is free from some of the -objections raised. It would, however, de mand an increase of postal employes. The plan involves a new policy that the Gen eral does cot feel at liberty to recommend. Taken as a whole, the report is antago nistic to any action regarding the postal telegraph at this time. There are objections to plans suggested, but no recommendation a* to means or schemes by which postal telegraphy may be accomplished. The ob jections raised are not, as we view them, all well taken. That which expresses so grave a fear of the danger of public pat ronage and misuse of lines by the dominant party has been, we think, answered al ready. The application of a civil service system that shall make the lines independ ent of political parties would protect them from misuse. Nevertheless, we are free to admit that even that system might be at the mercy of a partisan majority in Con gress. But this objection cannot apply to the plan to permit a company chartered by the Government to construct lines over which the Postal Department may transmit messages at a uniform charge. The General admits that such a plan would greatly les sen rates, but raises the rather meager ob jection that the Government employes would still have to deliver and receive the telegrams, and this would be a new policy be hesitates to recommend. We fail to see j bow the delivery and receipt of messages to be sent over contract lines can in any way be more dangerous than the receipt and delivery of messages by private cor porations as now, which, if they chose to be dishonest, have all the means at com mand, without the responsibility that at i taches to the Government employe. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR. One of the most interesting paragraphs in the report of Secretary of War Lincoln is that wherein he advises that the pay of the common soldier be raised forthwith to SIC per month. It appears that in the fiscal year ending June 30th, there were no less than three thousand six hundred desertions. Thia extraordinary number of dishonored soldiers is a little leas total than the figure of ISS3. The Secretary, with a confession that is amusing, says, " the most earnest efforts are being made to ascertain, and, so far as possible, to do away with the causes for desertion." This leads him to the recommendation to in crease the pay. It should be done, and besides 0»a men who do labor for the Gov ernment at posts should be paid for it in addition just as much as the Government would have to pay workmen to perform the same duties. The soldier is not, or should not be called upon to do agricult ural labor, to cut and haul wood, to build roads in the remote regions, not demanded by military necessity, nor to do the work of the ordinary farm laborer. That he has been forced to these labors without recom pense, is one of the causes of desertion. The Secretary boldly says that, in his opinion, if General Crook ia left alone to manage the Apaches, he will settle the war in Arizona for all time, and probably with it the whole troublesome Indian question. The only remaining portion of the report aside from the statistical tables and routine announcements, that attracts special at tention, is that part in which he urges with great seriousness, that something be done at once to strengthen our coast and harbor defenses. They now amount to very little, and are a disgrace to the nation, o'i this point he says: "Our sea-coast, with ts great cities and important habors, is defenseless to-day against the attack of a modern ironclad, and it ia humiliating even to imagine the mortification, loss of life, property, and prestige to which we would be subjected should war come sud denly upon us, as, the history of nations 3hows, may happen at any time. For many year* no appropriations have been made for continuing the construction of our forts, and the barbette batteries, de signed for the country's defense, are in complete and rapidly going to ruin." LANDLORDISM AT THE NORTHWEST. The Oregotuan, published at Portland, a very able and observant journal, concludes, after reviewing the field, that "a very serious evil in Oregon and Wash ington Territory is large land holding. In some cases the land has been acquired sim ply through greed of land, and is held as a miser hoards gold ; in other cases it has been purchased at different times, and at low prices, and is held for speculation. Few persons who own considerable bodies of land attempt to make any real use of their possessions.'' Largo land-holding, as an evil, however, has not any deep root in the north country, and therefore now is the propitious season for awakening pub lic Sentiment there against a system that threatens to fasten landlordism upon the people in a most obnoxious form, for it is far easier to prevent than to correct it. It will do more than any other agency we can conceive of to check the development of a country. What the Northwest needs is many homes and many people. Land monopoly is the direct antagonist of homes and population. More than this, all its tendencies are to destroy the individual in dependence of the voter, and, by erecting tenancy into a system, establish a servile class, bound not only to pay tribute to but to do the bidding of the landlord class, because personal interests, comfort and livelihood depend upon it. THE McGARRAHAN CLAIM. It is said, though it seems scarcely pos sible of belief, that the McGarrahan claim will again come before Congress at the present session. Is it possible to kill off that infamy ? It has been routed in the Courts ; throttled in the Government De partments time after time ; kicked out of Congress — and yet it lives. Is it possible to brirg the matter to an end ? Is there no finality to such proceedings and claims? Well may the New York Tribune exclaim that it is a case which has been settled so often that at last it begins to be doubtful if so much settlement ha» not unsettled it forever. _»--• — THE 

PRESIDENT'S M ESSAGE. We publish this morning a six-page cdi- | tion of the Record Union*, presenting the President's message in full, and synopsis, epecially ptrp&rrd, of the reports of the Secretary of War, Postmaatcr-General and j Secretary of the Interior. Tnese public j documents will be found to be of more than usual interest, and to repay careful perusal and analysis. • • Tun public will be astonished at the statement made at a meeting of the Academy of Sciences, in Sin Francisco, on Monday, that the Lick Telescope will in.'. be completed for many years, and that the present generation will never, In all probability, see it. Are the resources of the world so poor that it will take thirty years to construct the Instrument? We do n>t believe it. There is mismanagement and neglect somewhere. ■ . Wi agree with the Oregonian that "ill matter of policy merely it would be a great mistake for the Republican party to assume further responsibility for Mahnnc by yielding to his appeal for support as the champion of an oppressed aud bulldozed race.'' But the South nil mid not mistake lack of sympathy for Mahone as an indorsement of the outrages of which V.ahotie complains. Tils St. L"'. Globe-Deinocrit is thus outspoken : " Some of the tariff tinkers who arc neither free traders nor protectionists have queer ideas. A few Eastern ' revenue reformer*,' for instance, denounce the Hawaiian treaty, although that contention has done more proportionally to secure foreign markets for our manufactures than any other experiment tried since the war." .

[SPECIAL DISriTCHBS TO TBS RKCORS-CXIOX.] CALIFORNIA. Application (.ranted Runaway Mules. San Fbancisco, December 4tb —Applica tion was made this afternoon to the Probate Court by General Andrado for an expendi ture by the Blythe estate of $10,000, in fur therance of a colonization scheme in Mexico, organized by tbe deceased millionaire, which is at present on the point of realizing large profits for grants and subsidies, without which expenditure the estate might be liable for damages, and would jeopardize the success of the venture. The application was advocated by all the attorneys represented in the contest over the distribution of the estate, and the Court granted an order accordingly. While a number of mule* were being [ shipped to Honolulu yesterday on the bark Discovery, some of them took fright and ran i away. As one of them was being led by a lasso to the deck it ran around a coal cart, drawing the lasso around the driver, lifting him into tbe air and dropping him on the as phaltum road bed, severely injuring him about tbe head. Money In San Francisco. San Francisco, December 4th. — Money is iv fair demand. The taxes are absorbing large amounts, but the bulk of payments is yet to be made. The County Treasurer re ports 8250,000 now on hand. The average rate for first-class commercial paper is 7 per cent. The savings banks are taking mort gages on city real estate at 6, when they cannot get more. There is less de mand for fine silver and Mexican dollars.

Colton vs. Leland Stan ford et als. was resumed this morning. The proceedings commencsd with the reading of the depositions of William Solomon, William B. Bonn and James Seligman, bankers and brokers in New York city. The evidence contained in them related chiefly to tbe values of Central Pacific and Southern Pa cific bonds and stock* in 1879 and 

ISSO. After the offering of other documentary evi dence, N. T. Smith, Treasurer »nd Director of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, was called to the stand, and examined as to his connection with the company, and the manner of making contracts with the West ern Development Company. Pending bis examination a recess was had until 2 o'clock. [SECOND DISPATCH.] Santa Rosa, December 4th. — After recess N. T. Smith was further examined as to his relations with the road* leased by the Central Pacific, and the amount of stocks standing in his name, or owned by him. On cross-exam ination he testified that in conversation with Governor Stanford he protested against the appointment of General Colton as financial director of the Southern Pacific, for the rea son that it was dangerous to put so much power in the hands of one man, and that he had not full confidence in General Colton'* integrity. He was re-examined by Mr. Hayes on this point, aud witness stated that Governor Stanford told him he was not aware that so much power had been invested in General Colon, bat that some one had to be trusted, however, and he would take tbe mat ter under advisement. The next witness was D. T. Phillips, of the Central Pacific freight department, who testified that he was elected a Director of the Western De velopment Company on June 21, 1875. That 10,000 shares of stock stood in his name, the certificate for which he indorsed and re turned to Mr. Crocker, That be had then no information aB to the real owner of that stock, but has Bines learned that it was the property of Mark Hopkins. Instructions regarding the management of the affaire of the West ern Dave'.opment Company always came from General Colton, am! the Directors in all their undertakings endeavored to carry out the views expressed by him. Charles Crocker took no part in the management of the com pany whatever. The deposition of John Perry, Jr., was then rend in evidence, to show the value of Central Pacific sinking fund bonds as compared with the 0 per cent, first mortgage bonds. Documentary evidence consisting of mortgages, bonds, leases, etc., was next introduced, and occupied the atten tion of the Cuirt until the hour of adjourn ment. A Hung Jury— Switch Tampered Willi. Stockton, December 4th. — Tul'y, the teacher of Athiarn District School, who took poeeession of the school-house on the 19_h of last month and refused to vacate, was tried before Justice Treadwell on a charge of malicious mischief, and the jury failed to agree. About four b'ocVn distant from the depot, in this city, train No. 17, going to Gait, rau into an open switch, and the engine, tender and baggage car were ditched. The switch bad been tampered with, and the lock and chain torn off. No person was injured, as the train was going slow when the accident occurred. Heeling of Tulare County <lllzen*. Vis ALIA, December 4'.h. — Representative citizens, including Major McQaiddy and Doyle, of Mussel Slough, have held a meet ing in Visalia to consider the matter of tff act ing the settlement of the railroad land troubles. Hoi. P. D. Wigginton, attorney for the railroad company, was present. Speeches were made by Judge Clougb, of San Francisco ; liddy, of Hanford ; K. Jacobs, of Yisalia ; Doyle, of Grangeville, and Wiggin.on followed in an elcquant re sponse. It is thought that the prosperity of the county now demands a peaceable settle ment of these difficulties. A conciliatmy spirit prevailed in the meeting, and steps were taken by the citizens king towards the desired result. Public sentiment is that it a similar feeling is manifested by the rail road an amicable settlement will be brought about. The finch. Murder Trial.

AIII/IIM. ! The Savages or Yellow Fever. Tucson. December 4 th.— The fearful ray ages of yellow fever in Sonora during the past season have been reported in v. rue and many ways. Those who hat interests thrre invariably draw it mid, while others, simply sojourning there, or passing through the c mntry, tell doleful stories of the ravages of the dreadful disease. Five young men, from Kansas City, Mo., left Hermosillo a short time since for Mazatlan, where four sickened and died. The fifth, .Toe Priestly, rehired to Nogales a week ago Thursday, with the in tention of going home the next day. He heard of a ticket at Magdalena to Kansas City at a reduced rate, and Saturday he want there to br.7 it. He came back to Nogales Sunday, was taken sick that day with yellow fever, on Tuesday hid ths black vomit, and on Thursday died. He had a number of frier in Nogales, who cave him a respect able burial. The attending physician says he would have died even if he had reached Kansas City, his system was so saturated with the disease.

Record-Union : We are both sur prised and pained at your report of the ex pressions of members of the Board of Health about diseased meat, as given in your issue of the 31 instant. Ode member of the Board says he is informed that large quantities of diseased meat is being daily distributed among consumers of Sacramento. A second says his investigations a year ago justifies him in corroborating the information, and a third lends force to the charge by relating an inter new with a butcher who felt surprised at anyone eating mutton chops, since during or after dry seasons sheep were invariably poisoned by abscessen, etc., and consequently rendered unfit for eating purposes. Positively this is a charge at once sweeping and humili ating to butchers and dealers in meat. Cer tainly the learned members of the Board did not fully consider the gravity of tbe charge before announcing it to the public. Had they done so they must have anticipated what a serious injustice it must work to all honest proprietors of retail meat markets. If mem bers of the Board have been informed that diseased is being palmed off for sound meat, they certainly mast have been informed also who tbe perpetrators are. Why, then, do they not give publicity to their names, and let them alone suffer for so grossly violating the rules of health. Coming as it does from a body of gentlemen noted for their intelligence, this statement will be ac cepted and believed by every citizen who reac's the morning paper, the illiterate and educated alike, and every meat merchant of Sacramento will be sprinkled with the odium thereof. This is very wrong. The innocent should not suffer for the guilty. If there lives in Sacramento to-day the proprietor of a retail meat market or a slaughter-house who does, knowingly, barter in diseased meat of any kind, and the members of the Board of Health, or anyone else, are aware of such actions, let them be brought to the surface. Punish them, but do not chastise all the butchers of Sacramento far the acts of a villainous few. Such a course would have much more effect in remedying the evil, if there is such an evil, than the appointing of a dozen inspectors. To conclude, experi ence teaches us that sheep are never so healthy as during or after moderately dry seasons, ami instead cf being poisoned l.y ah scessas, their flesh is usually of the most wholosome character.
