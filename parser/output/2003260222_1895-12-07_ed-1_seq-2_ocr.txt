However correct, from a legal stand point, the decision of Judge Bellinger, which freed the Indian from his tribal restraint and gave to him greater liber- . ties, may have been, it is doubtful if the granting of these privileges will inure either to the benefit of the Redman or his neighbors of whiter hue. The In dian, in many instances, has made praiseworthy progress towards a better condition of living, and was showing .. himself gradually coming nnder the in fluence of a gentler civilization. Upon the reservation the tepee' was giving way to the four-walled house, and tilled fields gave evidence of a willingness to to work at farming. A spring wagon drawn by harnessed horses, instead of the patient cayuse bending under double burden showed that tue Indian was susceptible to demands of comfort and the influencs cf environment. The work done by the government schools has demonstrated that the children of savage ancestry have in them elements which go to make up character, and the record of the Indian boys and girls who Lave attended Hampton Institute and the Carlisle school give much in the way of encouragement. These and other evidences show that the Indian is becoming less of a savage and more like what the white man is supposed to be. But by no means do they prove that he is ready for the privi leges and rights of citizenship. This honor has come too soon, and the with drawal of the restraint which in the past has been found so necessary for the proper guidance of the Indian, is apt to undo the work which many years of patient endeavor have accomplished - Since the allotment of lauds in severalty and the consequent coming of citizen ship, which by Judge Bellinger's deel sion followed, the Indian has thought it necessary, or at least pleasing, to adopt all the customs of white men, and the result is anything but satisfactory. Some testimony upon this point comes from Agent Brentano, of the' Grand Eonde reservation, who in his report to the government says that all control of the agent over the reservation Indian is .gone, and the latter proceeds to get drunk, gamble and break laws with im punity. Ten years more of education and discipline, while it would not have made the Indians safe from the tempta tions which beset all men, yet it would have made him wiser and more capable of resisting the power of his appetites the inheritance of savagry. here we baye a very considerable in crease in the republican vote accounted for..

There is, says the Globe-Democrat, -a -constant and serious necessity of watchfulness on the who are affected by its operations, particularly under sucti a svstem as onrs. The machinery is not so organized that it can be relied upon to render the desired service by virtue of its own inherent power. It is only what the men make it who are intrusted with the control and direction of it, and what it is permitted to be by the people. The idea of the delegation of authority to chosen political agents does not carry with it the condition of exemption for citizens from duty and responsibility.

ESI0ENT3 MI33AGE. Spokesman Review: The' single re deeming feature of the message is its strong reapseruon of the Monroe doc trine. While in all other respects the president advances no foreign policy, it is a pleasure to note that respecting Venezuela and .England's interference there he speaks with vigor and patriot ism, in other respects the message is hardly worth a busy man's time for reading. It does not ven possess the merit of giving the country a' concise re view of the various affairs of the gov ernment. Evening Telegram : In his message to congress President Cleveland made no allusion whatever to the Nicaragua canal. That the omission was accidental must be doubted in view of the nnmer ous matters of comparatively minor im portance which were generously treated to language. The country is very anx ious to learn iust how Mr. Cleveland stands on the canal question, and the best and quickest way to ascertain his attitude is by sending to him for signa ture a hill authorizing this government to assume control of the canal and com plete its construction. lower berth. WHY 

MARYLAND WENT VUBLICAN. RE- Senator Gorman has recovered suffi ciently from the rude awakening which the late elections caused, to offer some explanation of why Maryland went re publican. Gorman offers the correct reason when he attributes the landslide to the sympathy which the people of Maryland have for protection. That state is becoming more and more desir ous of obtaining a leading position in the manufacturing world, and the policy of the democratic party offered them no good prospects for such a condition. While Mr. Gorman has overlooked the fact that his own misdeeds have con tributed in no small measure to demo cratic success, yet Maryland would have gone republican this year if Gorman had never lived or been a statesman of unblemished reputation. The same causes that made Maryland republican this year will operate to the same effect next fall. Here is Gorman's explana tion. "The state (Maryland) went republi can because the republican vote has largely increased, a very obvious and somewhat significant reason. "The republican vote a year ago throughout the state was 3000 larger than the democratic vote, and nobody pretended to assert then that the result was due to any personal causes or to op position to any one man. The fact is that the protection sentiment in the state has largely increased. In my own county, for example, we have a number of woolen mills. Until very recently they have been run upon a rongh and cheap class of goods. In the last two or three years, however, they have under taken a higher grade of work, and In order to do it they have been obliged to import a large number of skilled labor ers from Massachusetts and other New England states. Most of these men are republicans. A like condition of affairs exists in other counties of the state, and Twenty-one of the presidents of the United States are dead. They all lie buried in nine states. Virginia holds five Washington at Mt. Vernon, Thom as Jefferson at Monticello, James Madi son at Montpelier, and James Monroe and John Tyler at Richmond. In New York lie Van Buren at Einderhook, Fillmore at Buffalo, Grant at Riverside Park and Arthur at Albany. In Ohio are William Henry Harrison at North- bend, Hayes at Columbus, and Garfield at Cleveland. In Tennessee are An drew Jackson near Nashville, Polk at Nashville, and Andrew Johnson at Greenville. The two Adamses are buried at Quincy, Mass., and . Taylor, Pierce, Buchanan and Lincoln are buried respectively at Louisville, Ky Concord, N. H., Lancaster, Penn., and Springfield, 111. There is but one ex- president of the United States alive at the present time, Benjamin Harrison! Sheriff DeRackin inform the Walla Walla Statesman that Sprague is fast losing population since the loss of the N. P. car shops and division headquar ters. Before the fire, bprague bad a population of 2900 with 600 voters. It is doubtful whether the registration for the next city election will show more than 100 voters. The life of a railroad town is certainly very uncertain unless that town is backed by other resources, as is The Dalles. The taking awav of the railroad shops from this place, while it was a loss to be regretted, did not pre vent the growth and prosperity of the town. Although we have made good progress without the O. R. & N. Co. shops, we would bless any stroke of for tune that would bring them to us again. Every business man and every pro fessional man should hasten to aid the committee of seven in their endeavors to form an organization conducive to the welfare of the town. The Dalles needs an organic body which will rep resent the business solidity of the town. I Pendleton, La Grande, Baker City, Walla Walla and other places, no greater than The Dalles, have these organiza tions, and find in them an opportunity for good to the town. Now that the pro ject has been started, it must not be al lowed to drop. Every business man should lend heartv support to the new organization. The American people have the repu tation of taking more interest in politics than those of any other country ; but as a scatter of fact, this interest is apt to be only spasmodic, generally speaking and not regular and persistent. When there is a president to be elected, for in stance, they rally to the support of their respective parties in a zealous way, and as long as the campaign lasts the air is filled with political enthusiasm. But after the election, calmness and luke warmness ensue, and nobody seems con' cerned about the matters that so recent' ly caused so much activity and excite ment. This comparative lethargy usu ally continues until the time draws near for another casting of votes, and mean while gross abuses often creep into the processes of legislation and administra tion, and trusted agents turn out to be disappointing because thev have not been properly watched. The average citizen is absorbed in his private busi ness to an extent that practically sua pends his relation to. politics, and the public interests are. left to the mercy of circumstances. Prof. Bryce related. with an accent of surprise, that when he was in this country he traveled clear across the continent without once hear ing a word spoken on any political topic His experience is hardly to be taken as a constant illustration; but it is true, unquestionably, that there is a prevail ing disposition, except at certain inter vals, to subordinate politics to other subjects. This form of neglect, this evasion of duty and responsibility, is the sdurce of most of our political evils and misfor tunes. We allow mistakes to be made and wrongs to be perpetrated that might be prevented. The theory that what is everybody's business is nobody's business blunts the sense of heedfulness and provides chances for mischief to take root and grow. The monthly statement issued by the treasury department shows during No vember the public debt increased $2,046,- 503. The deficit for the five months of this fiscal year is $15,869,327. It is for tunate for the country that not much more than a year will elapse before men with better business methods will be placed at the head of government. The republican party will not be in power till March 4, 189. Although possessing a majority in the house of representatives and a plurality in the senate, President Cleveland stands as the great obstacle to desired reforms. Although the last congressional election was a repudiation of democratic legisla tion, yet the country will have to wait a weary vear or more before the ends for which the people voted can be attained. The Dalles has long needed a board of trade or a commercial club. It now looks as if it were going to get what has been one of its greatest needs. 

CONCERNING A BOAT RAILWAY. Speaker Reed made a trite saying when he declared that "those who have acted with wisdom heretofore may be fairly expected to act with wisdom here after." The republican party has brought the country through times more troublous than its present predica ment, and it can safely be trusted with leadership again. . Judge Ricks, of the United States cir cuit court of Ohio, has decided that the comptroller ' of the currency can make an assessment on stockholders of insol vent national banks, and that the as sessment can be recovered by a suit at law. The decision is a most important one. ' Some idea ot the late political land slide may be obtained when it is noticed that , in seating the members of the hoose of. representatives the first and last two on the democratic side were al lotted to the republicans, in addition to the seats commonly theirs. . Albany Herald: For a number of years the theory ot a ship railway has been under discussion, with many able and emineut.engineers as its advocators. It remained, however, for an obscure Swedish mechanic to put the idea into actual practice and construct a' vessel which runs in the water and propels it self on the ordinary rails of a railroad by land. It is u&ed as a passenger boat on two lakes separated by a strip of land over which it railroads itself, and it forms a practical illustration of the perfect feasibility of the scheme. Portland Telegram : The commercial travelers having set themselves a task of no mean proportions, are setting about earnestly to further the work which they think is not being sufficient' ly pushed by the government. The last congress, through ex-Senator Dolph, ap propriated $100,000 for a survey of the upper Columbia, over which it was de sirable to have a boat railway. In a resolution passed by the Commercial Travelers' Association it is stated that even if begun at once, with the usual preliminaries and red-tape proceedings In such . an undertaking, the present generation would hardly see its comple tion. The projectors are going to pro ceed in a thoroughly practical manner with this private enterprise. After the conference between the committees a mass meeting will be held. With a nucleus in some bank for a starter tbt. farmers will be invited to lend a help ing hand by subscribing 100 to 00 bushels of wheat. Pendleton East Oregonian : In every part the message is a dignified recital of all our relations at home and abroad, and this in a spirit of the utmost fair ness, the broadest treatment and with full consideration of everv individual's rights, no matter his position or stand ing among his fellowmen. It is needless to say that the president's message is a business man's document as well as the utterances of a statesman and American. There is none of the virus and bluster of the jingoist about it. There Is no "bad blood" shown against other countries and governments, but a determination to preserve and uphold the right that is refreshing. 

ABOUT AN OPEN RIVER. Arlington Record : Paul Mobr is out buying right-of-way for . his portage around Turn water and Celilo. He is repeating the much worn story that the portage will be completed in time to haul the next crop. This much is cer tain, he has been buying right-of-wav and paying the cash for it. Goldendale Sentinel : Brother Ire land savs a canal and locks can be built around the upper obstructions in three years. We agree with him, but as the government isn't in that big a rush and the engineers have recommended a boat railway, we'll have to take what we can get. The government never rushes anything, especially when there s a rail road company working against the im provement. Ve believe Uncle Sam's agents make more money by taking it easy, in such a case, and going slow. Nothing is generally gained by bucking against the recommendations of the gov ernment engineers, so the people ard press should help rush the thing through, for tbev will accomplish no more by objecting than the fellow that Bits by and sucks his thumb. land has' been opened up by the Bailey Ditch Company, which has about nine miles of ditch completed,' and water covering about 2000 or 3000 acres. They will rent these tracts to persons who wish theraj and furnish plenty of water for one half of the produce raised. The lunda are on the Columbia river, a few miles above Coyote station, and the past season thecompany has cultivated about 100 acres, and has raised some of the finest garden truck that ever grew in this section of the country; and for frnit-raisers the climate and soil cannot be excelled.

The drama, "The Old Homestead," drew a large crowd to Durham's hall the 20th, people coming from Mitchell, Prineville, Fossil and the surrounding country. A half hour before the doors wers opened over a hundred people were waiting for admission. The large hall was crowded to its utmost capacity, over $300 being taken in at the door. The play was an entire success and fully sus taiued the reputation of the Antelope Dramatic Club. Each character was admirably taken and the statno in the second act, represented by Miss Nettie Glisan, was par excellence, its equal having never been seen by theater-goers even in the large cities. The orchestra furnished someone music and the choir gave several beautiful, songs with Mrs. G. H. Dunn presiding at the organ. . Hoenette. Antelope, Dec. 2d. N For Home-Seekers. An effort is being made to reclaim some of the ana lanas petween nemo and Umatilla. A large tract of fine The popularity of the Chase Stock Company was evinced by the large au dience which greeted it last evening to witness the performance of "Two Or phans.'' The play is a strong, emotional drama showing life in the Great French capital near the close of the 18th cen tury. The piece is a serious one, en livened now and then by touches of humor. The scenery and stage settings last evening were especially worthy of mention as they were in perfect keeping with the circumstances and spirit of the production. The scenery for the act, in which were shown the prison and some of the great buildings of Paris in the dis tance, was some of the most realistic ever placed on a Danes stage, ine characters last night were well sus tained each participant acting with the enthusiasm necessary to make a play well received. As seven acts were required to complete the performance, the audience was treated to some extra playing by the Orchestra Union, which proved the delight that it always does. The Chase Stock Company are making a good impression on theatre goers and the crowded bouse last night shows that the company wears well. The steamer Sarah Dixon, which tem porarily is under charter by The Dalles Portland and Astoria Navigation Com pany had a rather lively time on the lower river during the hurricane, of which mention was made yesterday.

In response to notices published in Tub Ciiboxiclk, a large number of gentlemen assembled at the council chambers last evening to take part in the formation of the club. The hour set for the meeting was 8 o'clock, bat at that time only one person was present, and at 8:30 only five or six ap peared. The ; promoters were a little , discouraced, but said nothing, and soon the crowd began to come, and by 9 o'clock the room was well filled with an enthusiastic business assemblage. Mr. H. A. Bill called the meeting to order, and the minutes of the previous meeting were read by the secretary. Max A. Vogt. The club then rapidly pro ceeded to an organization. A motion was made that the club adopt the con stitution, by-laws and roles of the Mult nomah Athletic Club of Portland sub ject to any amendments that might be made, and this motion, after some amendments had been proposed, was carried. It was suggested that the test way to get an organization was to choose a board of trustees and place the affairs of the club in their hands. It was finally decided to elect seven such trust ees, and the chairman appointed Messrs. Crowe, Sinnott and Wilson a committee to select a list of names from which the seven trustees were to be chosen. The committee reported twelve names, and a ballot taken to choose seven. The following were elected as trustees of the , club: E. C. Pease, H. J. Maier, John S. Schenck, R. B. Sinnott, H. A. Bill, J. S. Fish and W. H. Wilson. This board of trustees will select officers from among themselves and proceed with the organization of the club. Com-. munication will be established with other clubs and gymnastic houses rela tive to securing apparatus and steps taken to secure a suitable buildine. The members present last night showed wisdom in the election of the trustees, and a better board could not have been chosen. If the club can be formed as contemplated, it will be an excellent thing for the city. The inten tion is to have a complete gymnasium, with shower bath attachment, bowling alley, reading room and a place for social gathering. It is intended that the club will be the social organization of the town. The men will not be selfish in the matter and on certain days during the week the club rooms will be turned over exclusively to the ladies. Another meeting will be held a week from next Friday, at which definite reports will be made by the trustees. mevjoase oiock uompany aeugniea a large audience at the theatre last night. The play was the "Little Coquette," an up-to-date comedy, writ ten by Charles W. Chase for laughable DurDoses onlv. The Dlot was fun-Dro- ducing and the situations very amusing. During the performance some neat specialty work was done, while the audience was favored with some Singing of high merit. Hettie Bernard Chase at "Little Coquette" acted her part in keeping with the good reputation she has earned in other cities. Mabel Eston -as "Aunt Jerusha" made a good impres sion, as also did Charles W. Chase in the part of "Cbas. Everett," a dude from Boston. Ed. F. Gardner in the character of "August Klotz" made a great hit and proved himself a comedian of good powers. He introduced some singing and dancing specialties which took well with the audience. The re mainder of the cast was good. Tonight will be presented "Two Orphans," a piece well worth witnessing, the critics say. Call It a Craze. AN
