PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES. How Lincoln. Johnson’ and Grant Prepared Their Official Documents— I The Rivalry to Secure 3lcssages in Former Days. Washington Post. The capacity of President Cleveland for hard work says a correspondent, is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that he is writing every word of his message. His experience last year, when he wrote with his own hand the longest message ever submitted by a president to congress does not seem t have dismayed him in the least. This year, although the mes sage will be briefer, it will be of sufficient length to make the physical task of writ ing it somewhat laborous. Thoroughly engrossed in his work, the president sees as few callers as he possibly can. Ha takes no recreation except a drive in the afternoon, and even Thanksgiving day was devoted to work. From morning to night he bends over his desk —a histori cal piece of furniture, made from the timbers of the ship Rescue and presented to this government by Queen Victoria of England. He writes a small cramped hand, but his pen moves over the paper with considerable ease, and he rarely has occasion to revise his matter. All the phrases in his writings which have become famous were first thoughts. Very few persons have any idea of the great amount of detail which the presi dent accomplishes. All his veto mes sages were written by him personally, and that too, in the longest possible way. In returning house bill No. 5968, for in stance, he wrote. “House bill number five thousand nine hundred and sixty eight.” He penned his Thanksgiving proclamation, Many of the letters whicli other presidents turned over to their secretaries are answered by him in per son. He even addressed with his own hand the envelope which informed Dis trict Attorney Benton of his reinstate ment. In personally writing his messages President Cleveland differs from any of his predecessors. Lincoln wrote compar atively little of his messages, but he paid close attention to the phraseology. In those days the “buts” and the “ifs” counted. He wrote a small, even hand, easily read, and his manuscript was not often marred by erasures. Johnson, who followed him, wrote still less. His right arm was crippled and he could not raise it to his head. He used pen and ink but rarely, finding a lead psncil less tiresome. It is said that he did not write a letter in ink after he be came president. He signed his name frequently, of course, but an entire letter in his handwriting is now worth almost its weight in gold. Ha dictated his mes sages to Col. William G. Moore, who was then his private secretary. He thought quickly, for the impossibility of writing developed the faculty of dictation to its highest degree. President Grant sent eight messages to congress. They were in the main con tributions from his cabinet others, writ ten in the first person and then dove tailed together. They were not finally submitted, however, without careful con sideration, Grant was cautious and con servative and carefully modified and re vised the recommendations of his cabinet officers. He loved to write, and all the additions and emendations of the mes sages were in his own handwriting. He wrote many autograph letters, and his vetoes were also in his own hand. He eould dictate, but not easily, and when ever he wanted to be particularly sorcible he shut himself in his room and, free from interruption, wrote out in full what he desired to say. Mr. Hayes wrote a sprawley irregular hand, hard to resd by those who were un accustomed to it. His message was largely the work of Mr. Rodgers, his private secretary, a man of considerable scholorship. Whatever polish they con tained was due entirely to Mr. Rodgers, and many portions, indeed, were written by the latter in the first instance. The cabinet officers aided largely in the work and their contributions were used with out revision. President Arthur’s hand writing was bold and large, showing con siderable force, and th* words and let ters were joined in an easy running style as if the writer had done considerable clerical duty. Surrogate Rollins, of Nw York, it is not generally known, was Mr. Arthur’s right-hand man in the prepara tion of the messages. Together they ar ranged the topics to be treated upon and many of the ideas contained in the documents emanated directly from Mr. Rollins. In former days the messages were dup licated on manifold paper, and when the private secretary was supposed to have reached the capitol —for there was no telegraph or telephone connection with the white house then —copies were dis tributed to tke anxious correspondents and reporters. Then there was a grand rush for the telegraph and newspaper offices: “I have seen them nearly break their necks in getting downstairs,” said a veterean employe of the white house, in describing the scene. Many of the newspaper men did not hesitate to go through the lower and private part of the building, and make short cuts to Pennsylvania avenue, through the grounds. Others, who had carriages and the fleetest horses the city could afford standing at the front entrance, at a speed far beyond the limits of the law. At the newspaper offices an extra force of com positors hurried the message into type. The public entered into the spirit of riv alry and large crowds surrounded the offices, all ready to cheer the first news boy who appeared with a bundle of papers under his arm. Nowdays it is different. The persons who, in these peaceful times, take even sufficient interest in a message to stauggle through its long array of commonplace sentences are in a large minority. A president’s message has always been regarded as the most important piece of news a correspondent eould secure. In the days of fluctuations in gold it had its value to Wall street also. Indeed, it is asserted at the white house that once dur ing Johnson's administration a New York broker, who was anxious to anticipate the effect of the president's recommenda tions on the market, offered §25,000 to an employe for an advance copy. His offer was declined. Despite this general desire to get hold of the messages only two have been prematurely printed, and both publications occurred during the administration of Mr. Hayes. The latter abandoned the old system of manifold ing, and had his messages printed in ad vance, copies being forwarded to collect ors of customs and postmasters for dis tribution to newspapers at noon of the day congress assembled. A copy, how ever, was taken from his desk and sold t the New York Herald for §SOO. It was carried by the correspondent up four flights of stairs to the operating room of the Western Union Telegraph company and given into safe keeping of the night manager. It was then divided among several trusted operators, and as soon as the last word had gone over the wiaes it was returned to the correspondent with out any of those cabalistic marks which press matter usually receives, and by him taken away. But the company, it is hardly necessary to add, did not lose its tolls. 

BUSTS OF THE VICE PTESIDENTS. They Arc to Adorn the Gallery of the Senate- A Good Portrait of Mr. Arthur. Last April, writes a Washington cor respondent of the New York Herald, the senate library committee reported a reso lution authorizing the payment from the contingent fund of a sum sufficient for the purchase of the busts of the vice ■presidents from John Adams down to the present time. The resolution, which was adopted without debate, provided that no more than five busts should be received within one fiscal year, and that each should be modeled by an artist re siding in the same state with the subject. The matter was then placed in the charge of Mr. Edward Clark, the architect of the capitol. —It was finally decided . that the first five should be the busts of the three vice presidents then living, —viz., Hanni bai Hamlin, William A. Wheeler, and Chester A. Arthur, — and then revert to Adams and Jefferson, coming down the line to Mr. Hendricks. The list includes only the legally-elected vice presidents, and not those who may have filled the office ad interim. It is the intention to place the five busts of those above-mentioned in the niches of the north wall of the senate chamber, where the vice presidents gen erally sit, but when all shall have been finished they will be arranged chronologi cally in their respective niches in the galleries of the senate. The busts will be placed on pedestals of a height suffi cient to prevent being handled by that class of curiously-disposed persons who can not be satisfied with anything less than personal contact with whatever hap pens to be placed on exhibition. The pedestal will be chiseled from marble of a color approximating the general tone of the wall —that of Sienha marble. The busts will stand three feet in height. They will be so arranged that the center of the face -vill be the point from which the semiclucular head of the niche might be descried. They will be executed from the best portraites obtainable. The effort will be to secure portraits contemporaneous with the services of the subject as vice president. Some difficulty may be experienced, it is feared in procuring good representations of some of the dead statesmen —such, for example, as these of Aaron Burr and Daniel Tompkins, of New York. The only good portrait of burr is believed to be that in the possession of Princeton college of which Jonathan Edwards, Mr. Burr’s grandfather, was at one time presi dent. Ex-President Arthur, npon being con sulted in regard to the matter, requested that Mr. St. Gaudens, of New York City, be Given the work of fashioning his features into olay. Mr. Wheeler expressed no preferace as to the sculptor, but regretted that on account of his health he could not give a personal sitting. He referred Mr. Clark, however, to a portrait, of himself at the bureau of engraving and printing in this city, which he regards as probably the best presentment of himself in existence, Mr, Clark has asked J. Q. A. Ward, of New York, to perform this work, but it is not known at present whether he will ac cept. To Mr. Franklin Simmons, of Maine, will be assigned the preparation of Mr. Hamlin's bust, while Mr. Daniel French of Massachusetts, and a Mr. Ezekiel, of Virginia will perform a similar service for ex-Presidents Adams and Jefferson. The sum which the artists will receive for this service will be §BOO, only one contract being awarded to each sculptor. A life-size portrait of President Arthur was made by Leciere, of New York, from many sittings, representing him as a gen tleman who had just stepped out of the main door of a mansion on to the porch to salute the face of nature on an autum nal morn. In one hand he was holding a book, with one finger between the leaves. A rose, as though fallen from his button hole, lay upon the step. The artist died before the picture could be criticised by Mr. Arthur, and through the aid of an eminent New York and Washington artist the changes desired by him were under taken. They did not relate in any degree to the face, but merely to the size and repose of the body. As changed under Mr. Arthur's direction this admirable work of art now adorns the white house, and is esteemed as a striking portrait. He Certainly Put His Foot In It, Chicago Tribune. A prominent Chicago real estate man and his partner were the best of friends, and tbeir intimacy extended to personal as well as business matters. His partner was a bachelor, and was in the habit ox reading him letters of an ardent and af fectinate nature from a young lady who signed herself “Susie.” The hero of the story went away on an extended trip and returned just in time to attend the wed ding of his partner. Wishing to show his good will he sent the happy couple a wedding present, and at the wedding re ception, stepped gallantly forward to pay his respects. “I hardly feel like a stranger,” he said in his sweetest tones, addressing the bride. “In fact I feel as though I ought to be quite well acquainted with my partner's wife, since he has often done me the honor to read me extracts from his dear Susie's letters.’’ The faces of the husband and the speaker were studies as the bride drew herself up and said emphatically and dis tantly: “I beg your pardon, sir, my name is Helen.” The Barber and the Boycott Barber —Yes, this boycotting is a great thing. It never did any good to barbers, though, because our union was not founded on the right plan; but it’s the strongest union on the globe now. Customer—Oh, well, im not interested in that. Get through some time to-day, I'm in a hurry and — “Y T es, as I was saying, all we have to do is to issue out an order. “Don’t shave that man,’ and he’s done for all over the United States—couldn’t get a hair off if his beard reached the ground. Have a shampoo?’’ “No —I mean yes, but hurry.” “Y r on need some hair restorer, too, I'll ust do up a dozen bottles.” “But ” “And we have the finest hair oil in the market. You will take a dozen ©f that I suppose.” “See here, does that union you speak of extend over Europe, too.” “Clear to the north pole.” “I'll take a keg. A MAX WHO WAS 

SCALPED. He Says the Operation Caused Him Consider able Pain - A Very Xarrow Escape from Death. San Franci-co Chronicle. It has often been said that a man can not live after being scalped, writes a Fort Keogh correspondent to the Chron icle. One of the Crow Indian scouts with Custer before that brave officer met his fate was caught by a party of Sioux alone on the prairie and scalped alive. His enemies cut a pear shaped piece out of the crown of his head and left him writh ing in agony, supoosing he would of course die. Notwithstanding all which he endured, the redskin recovered, and at last accounts was living with his people on the Crow reservation and doing well. There is an old hunter in western Mon tana whose cabin is located on the east ern slope pf the Rocky mountains, who had his hair raised some years ago by a band of savages, and yet he lives and thrives in most astonishing good health. The old fellow’s name is Ganzio, and by reason of his advanced years would, in the natural course of events, have white hair now, only that he has no hair at all to speak of. Still, what little he has got is whitened or gray, the rest of his head, “where the hair ought t© grow,” being as bald as a billiard ball. To be exact, Gan zio did not lose his entire scalp, but only a portion of it. The probabilities are that he could not have survived with the loss of the whole top of his head. Some few years ago, when Sitting Bull was master of this country, Ganzio was the guide of an emigrant party en route to Fort Laramie. The story of that dangerous expedition is an exceedingly interesting one, and as related by himself it runs as fol folws: “One day we were coming into the val ley of Hut creek, on our way to Fort Laramie, -when we thought we saw In dians coming down the creek to the right. Instead of camping there, we thought it safer to water our stock and go on to the hills and make a dry camp in the bushes. I had been sent on ahead up the hill to reconnoiter, and took with me a boy named Kountze, from Omaha, mere ly for company. We sat down to wait for the wagons, which were slowly coming up out of the valley. When the wagons reached us I started on alone through the rocks and pine bushes to seek a good camp. A few hundred yards further on I looked down a ravine to the right and faw five mounted Indiana ride across the valley. I started to go back to the train, when at least a dozen ran at me out of bushes, and you bet I ran and called for help. In a minute more two or three of them shot at me. I felt a sharp, sting ing pain in my right leg, and another in my left shoulder, and I fell. Then they were upon me in a minute, and one of them put his knee on my back, while another hit me with a club. Another struck me with the butt of a gun and I became partly unconscious. Still I had reason and feeling enough left to know I was being scalped; for the hair held so tightly and the pain was so awful that I could not die then even if I wanted to. I felt a hot stinging pain all around the top of my head —the hair being torn out by the roots, so to speak —and it was too much. I died, or at least I thought I did, but as it happened my scalp or at least a part of it, was saved just as it was being torn off. The boys at the wagon had seen me running and saw the Indians and came at a run —thirteen of them, arriv ing just in time to prevent the red devils finishing their work. The Indians, as well as my friends, thought I was dead, but I came to again, and what was left of my scalp was laid back in its place. It was only half torn off you see, and the place is pretty well healed now.” “What did you do with yourself after ward?” “Why, I hurried into Fort Laramie, got the attention of a physician, and went back to the states a while; but the western fever cams strong upon me again and I returned to the mountains, where I have been ever since. Calculating the Size of the Earth. Exchange. The earlier attempts at calculating the size of the globe were based on astrono mical observations. It would be difficult to-day to say within what degree of ac curacy the figure then obtained could have been relied upon, as the units of measurement used by those pioneers have been lost, and could not have been compared with the units now in use. One of the earlier attempts at obtain ing the actual length of the earth’s meri dian by direct measurement of a portion of the same was made in the sixteenth century by a French doctor. The means employed, although very ingenious, would be considered perfectly clumsy and inadequate by the modern scientist. There was in this early measurement no attempt at mathematical precision as understood in the present century, and considering the simplicity of the method employed by the doctor, it is only to be wondered that no greater error was ob tained in its final result. The measure ment consisted simply in driving from Baris to Amiens, and counting the revol utions of the wheels of the carriage, and from the number of revolutions of the wheels of the carriage, obtain the dis tance between the two cities, which could serve as the basis for calculating the length of the meridian. Of course this calculation could not by any means be considered accurate, but, taking into ac count the means employed, the result ob tained has been subsequently found to be wonderfully precise. The most curious thing about it is that what would now- be considered grave errors and inexactitudes were so distribu ted that they almost compensated each other, and the dimensions then obtained show only slight differences with the dimensions given by the most recent measurements, Thus chance and no better name could be found permitted of the same results, with only a small final error, being obtained with that mude method, that are now obtained with the most precise instruments and with the most complicated calculations. As to Whiskers. Two fallacies are in vogue regarding the whisker question. One is that a thin faced man should support side whiskers to widen his face; the other that a round faced fat man should favor long chin whiskers to lengthen his face. Both ire adopted on the counter-action and anti dote principle, but are wrong as wrong can be. A man with a sharp chin exposed is thin and appears thin in spite of his burnsides. And a moon-shaped man gives himself a humorous and clownish appearance by wearing a long, sharp tuft on his chin. The principle of conformity should be observed and a wholesale change made. A thin man, for instance, should not wear chin whiskers, no whiskers at all, or a beard. He no more looks well with side whiskers and a peaked chin than he would t® stuff his chest and not his cheeks and calves. To look well he must be uniformly and con sistently thin, or he may modify it by a complete beard. A fat man should be smooth-faced or wear universal whiskers pretty closely cropped. A well-propor tioned and moderately full-faced man may vary the style and quantity of his whiskers with impunity, so far as the thin or broad appearance is concerned. Avery short beard gives an animal look; if very large it indicates vanity or crank iness. A
