Texas, in the fiscal years of 1906 and 1907, will pay $900,000 to confederate veterans for pensons, besides expending $164,53$ for the support of the confed erate home. This is a rood country. "Every sun. set during the past five years has regis tered an Increase of $3,400,000 In the value of the farms to this country," according to the statement of Secretary Wilson of the Department of Agrlcur ture. In his annual report. The public debt of Russia, according to the latest official figures. Is approx- imately$4,000,000,000 (7,681,895,948 rubles) This sum Is larger by 616,000,000 rubles than the total debt one years ago. In addition to the public debt there is said to be a very large private indebt edness. Of the entire debt, public and private, owed In foreign countries, the great bulk la held tn France and Gei Nathan Straus of New York, who has given liberally both time and money to secure pure food, and especially pure milk for Infants was the chief cause of consumption in adults.

The work of the United States civil service com mission is constantly on the increase, and In Us report Just made It is re corded that 130,000 persons took civil service examinations last year for places in the United States govern ment service, and that positions were secured by 40,000 of them. So great has been the number of persons that take examinations that the expense has mounted up until the commission now recommends the collection of a small fee from applicants for examina tion- It is hoped by the collection of this fee to eliminate from examinations the large number of persons who take them out of curiosity or for the sake of securing a higher rating on the elig ible list through re-examlnation. Perhaps the civil service commission knows just what it Is about In recom mending a fee for the privilege of being examined, but we doubt It. In this land of the free there Shouldn't be any restriction placed on legitimate and meritorious ofBce-seeking. XOT AIZ LITERATE, This is a country of light and learn ing, and yet tfcere are many too many illiterate in it. There are 6,180,069 per- sens more than ten years of age who are Illiterate. This Is one-tenth of the whole number of persons ten years old and over. The proportion is 106 6 illit erates to 1,000 of population. The ne groes are chiefly responsible for this large figure. If they are excluded, the proportion of the illiterate in the na tive white population is found to be 46.4 per 1,000, or less than 1 in 20. For the negroes the proportion Is 444.7 per 1,000. For foreign-born whites the pro portion is 128.5 per 1,000. Progress Is being made. In 1890 the figure for ne gro Illiterates was 567-6 per 1,000; native whites, 62.3; foreign born whites, 130-6. Evidence of progress is seen also in the fact that among those of ages from 10 to 14 there are but 71-5 illiterates per 1,000, while in those of the age of 65 and over the Illiterates are 198.5 per 1,000. The younger generation is the less illiterate. There is evidence that girls are tending to become less Illit erate than boys. At the younger age periods the girls are already less illit erate than the boys, taking fuller ad-, vantage of school facilities. As might be expected. Illiteracy is fn general greater in the South than In the North for all classes of population. Perhaps the fairest Tasls of compari son between the two ' sections Is that for native white children Hying In cit ies of more than. 25,000 inhabitants. ' in the North Atlantic division the. illiter acy for this class of children is 2.1 and In the North Central 19; in the South Atlantic division it Is 8.3, anif in the South Central 13 7. In considering the significance i of such comparisons it should be remembered that the South has a larger number of children in proportion to population than the North and a smaller per capita wealth. The South Is, moreover, handicapped by the necessity of maintaining separate schools for whites and negroes. A FLT xtr THE OlXTMEin. There is so much that is all right in the President's message that it is both surprising and painful that he felt bound to recommend the Immediate admission of two States one to be composed of Oklahoma and the Indian Territory, the other to be composed of New Mexico and Arizona. How he could have arrived at such a recom mendation Is not understood by those Who know the condition of the territo ries and the feeling of the people of the territories, especially the people of Ar izona- There will be a strong protest against the recommendation. In fact, it has already begun- For Instance, the (Hartford Courant calls it a recom mendation of injustice and points out that it is not like Theodbre Roosevelt to be unjust. It adds': What evil coun sellors have secured his ear? He says there is ho Justification for delay. Is there any justification for raw, head long hftste for , dragging reluctant, protesting Amrlcan populations Into the Union by sheer force? Upon the political side, the party in power has had (in the free-coinage scare) a rath er impressive lesson on the folly of picking territories before they are ripe in order to increase the number of re publican votes In the Senate. But this time It isn't so much politics that is in a hurry as speculative greed largely of Pennsylvania antecedents. The President's motives are above suspi cion, but' he's on the wrong side of this "Statehood" question and in decidedly shady company. The indications are that there will be a lively contest over this matter in Congress. It is known that some of the congressmen who have been in fa vor of the course recommended by the President' have changed their minds, and it is to be hoped that tfcere will be contrary minds enough to carry the day for justice and good sense. oxe of Titic nussusr dajtgejis. William T. Stead, who recently re turned to England from Russia, thinks that European and especially English subjects are likely to bo in serious per- I I il In Russia, if the Russian mujiks ' break loose from all restraint In St Petersburg, he says, he was told re peatedly that the revolutionary move. ment was financed in England and di rected from London. This seemed to be a matter of common faith even among persons who professed friend ship for England- The accidental de parture of the British ambassador for home, contemporaneously with the oc currence of the railroad strike, was quoted as proof positive that he had full knowledge of all that was to hap pen. A repent number of the Moscow Gazette was devoted to the support of the theory that the revolution is of English origin. As evidence of this it argued that Russian Nihilists and ter rorists, even though their hand3 were stained with blood, were always shel tered and feted in England, that Eng lish Liberals like Mr. R. Spence Wat son were members of "the Friends of Russian Freedom," that English publi cists like Sir Frederic Pollock had fos tered, more or less openly, the agita tion which had let loose the revolution ary forces, which are now bearing their natural fruit in massacre and ar son. Moreover, the Jewish agitation against Russia always had its head quarters in London. Mr. Stead argues that if this feeling prevails in newspaper offices and drawing-rooms it is probably to be found also, in the street, and that therefore It behooves Europeans, Eng- lishmen and Americans to take pre That looks reasonable- cautions.
