ISLANDS IX GOOB COXBITIOX. Dr, Barrows Reports Philippine* Well Governed—Xo Sug:ar Market. Dr. D. P. Barrows, director of edu cation of the Philippines, was a passen ger on the steamer Siberia, arriving at San Francisco from the Orient the other day. In speaking of the condition of the islands Dr. Barrows said: “The islands are in a good condition, generally speak ing. The political situation there at the present time is the best it has ever been. The provincial government is in good hands. There are about forty native gov ernors for as many different provinces. They are serious and intelligent men and at the recent conference held in Manila they showed themselves to understand the situation in the islands and to fully ap preciate the attitude of the United States. While all these governors but one are natives, they all speak and understand English. From an economic standpoint, however, the islands are not in what I would call a good condition. This is caused by the fact that there is no market for their sugar and tobacco. These, of course, are their principal staples. They, however, have a good market for copra and abaka and from these they gain their main revenue.”

Child slavery is being practiced in Ne braska. according to the statements of Miss Cora Garber, one of the employes in the State land commissioner’s office. Proof has been obtained, she asserts, that one private institution in the State has been importing children from Germany for the purpose of selling them at $25 per head. A bill is to be introduced at the next Legislature, says Miss Garber, which will place every child in the State under the protection of the juvenile court law. At present the law is so worded that the courts have no right to enter private in stitutions to inquire into the condition of children. This provision. Miss Garber says, was slipped 'into the law by the managers of these institutions in order to exempt them from legal investigation and for this reason the juvenile court law is unconstitutional. Miss Garber refused to give the name either of her informants or of the suspected institu tions. but said that all would be made public in due time and that the work of the “venders in little human beings” would be summarily stopped and the guil ty persons punished.

Interesting Statistics Showing the Results of Twelve Months in Agricul ture, Manufacture and General Trade. Eradstreet's Commercial Agency has prepared an interesting table show ing the status of the leading lines of American agriculture, manufacture and general trade for the year. The figures are given below, although many are estimates and subject to final revision: Per cent, 100*3. 1905. gain or loss. Corn, bushels 2,881,006,000 2,707.993.540 Increase 6.4 Wheat, bushels 739.883.000 692.970.489 Increase 6.7 Oats, bushels 863,352,000 953.216.197 Decrease 9.4 Barley, bushels 144.528.000 136.651.020 Increase 5.7 Rye, bushels 30.000.000 28,485.952 Increase 5.3 Buckwheat, bushels 13,688,000 14.585.082 Decrease 6.1 Total, six leading cereals 4.672.547,000 4.533.911.250 Increase 3.1 Potatoes, bushels 303.267.500 260.741.294 Increase 16.5 Sugar (Louisiana), pounds 593.600,000 739,200.000 Decrease 19.6 Sugar (Porto Rico), pounds... 571,200.000 477.120.000 Increase 19.7 Sugar (Hawaii), pounds 884,800,000 562.4(*0,000 Increase 2.G Sugar, beet (United States) pounds 772.800.000 636.100.000 Increase 21.4 Sugar, total pounds 2.882.400.000 2,714.880.000 Increase 3.9 Apples, barrels 36,000,000 24.000.000 Increase 50.0 Cranberries, barrels 250.000 136,800 Increase 82.7 Cotton, bales 12.500,000 11,345.988 Increase 10.2 Tobacco, pounds 628,814,800 633,033.719 Decrease .6 Shoo shipments, eastern (ten months), cases 2.361.569 4.248.057 Increase 2.6 Iron ore shipments (lake), tons 37.000.000 34.100,000 Increase 8.5 Pig iron production, tons 25,000,000 23.000,000 Increase 5.6 Coal, anthracite shipments (ten months), tons 45.680,414 50,593,504 Decrease 9.7 Building expenditure (ten mos.) 32 cities $400,934,988 $380,516,192 Increase 5.2 Bank clearings, ten months... .$131.097.795.346 $115,678,335,231 Increase 13.2 Railway earnings, gross. 9 mos. $1,439,457,962 $1,267,297,075 Increase 13.5 Exports of merchandise (ten months) Imports of merchandise (ten months) $1,046,392,809 $979,717,437 Increase C. 7 Total foreign trade (10 months) $2,471,565,516 $2,236,641,791 Increase 10.5 Business failures, number (ten months 7,669 8,233 Decrease 6.8 Business failures, liabilities (ten months) $101,276,480 $100,742,108 Increase .4 Money in circulation Nov. 1.... $2,866,882,786 $2,653,131,578 Increase 8.0 Money in circulation per capita $33.68 $31.69 Increase 6.2 Explanatory of the above figures, it might be said that the large barley, corn and wheat crops more than made up for smaller yield of oats, the net result began an aggregate yield of all cereals combined 3 per cent larger than in 1905, and larger even than the combined record yield of past years. A next to record yield of potatoes, a record sugar crop, a fair sized apple crop, and a next to record cotton crop are among the features indicated. The yield of tobacco will, however, be light. Larger yields of most crops indicate a heavier total money value to the farmer than a year ago. In industry, it is to be noted that nearly all lines of endeavor show larger outputs than a year ago. Shoe shipments show a gain of 2.6 per cent on last year; iron ore shipments and pig iron production break all records, gaining 8.5 per cent in each case over the hitherto record year 1905. Building construc tion was never so active. Anthracite coal shipments, however, are a conspic uous exception, showing a decrease of 9.7 per cent from 1905. Prices of all staples have shown great strength, and the general level of all values, as indicated by Eradstreet’s approximate index number, is G per cent above a year ago and 53 per cent above the low water mark set in July, 1896. Large crops, high prices and active industry naturally find reflection in large financial and trade totals. Foreign and domestic trade has reached un precedented heights, as indicated by gains of 6.7 per cent in imports and of 13.4 per cent in exports, and in a total foreign trade 10.5 per cent ahead of 1905. Railway earnings and bank clearings show nearly similar gains over a year ago, 13.5 and 13.3 per cent respectively. Business failures are 0.8 per cent fewer while liabilities are only four-tenths of 1 per cent larger than in 1905. The volume of money in circulation is the largest ever recorded. TILLMAN IN FIERY TALK. Senator In Chicago Lecture Predicts Race War. Senator Benjamin It. Tillman passed unscathed through an exciting meeting in Orchestra Hall, Chicago, the other night. arrested and taken from the gallery. The colored people of Chicago had attempted to have the lec ture called off because of the race preju dice it might arouse. The speaker argued that the fifteenth amendment had not conferred suffrage on the colored man, because it did not confer it on the white man, declaring that it simply prohibited any State from enact ing a law discriminating on account of color. ‘‘So the southern people are con fronted with a prohibition which says. ‘Make any rule you please, provided it applies to both races alike.’ “Now, how many of you know that there are 30,000 more colored than white people in the States of North Carolina. Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Missis sippi? How many of you know that in South Carolina there are 230,000 more blacks than there are whites? South Car olina and Mississippi are swimming for their lives. “You make up your minds that equality before the law is right and should he en forced, notwithstanding it would result in two States at least being absolutely dominated by the negroes.’ He declared the North was face to face with the prop osition “in the near future, if not at this time.

Flames Cause Heath anil Panic In Salvation Army Hotel. The Lighthouse hotel, a three-story structure at Ninth and Market streets, St. Louis, utilized as a Salvation Army ■barracks, was damaged by fire early Wednesday, when probably 500 homeless men were lodged within it. Six lost their lives and probably thirty-five were injured, about half that number being seriously injured, some not being expect ed to live. The fire started on the third floor and swept through the old building rapidly. Men fought at the windows to secure the life-lines and slide to the street, but so great was the frenzy with which the ropes were seized and held that they were of little avail and those who could not escape by the stairway leaped from the windows. A large number of those who jumped were caught in nets, but many jumped before the nets were stretched and were injured. There was only one stairway and the panic stricken men surged down this stairway to the street, only to find the door locked. A jam resulted and probably a great loss of life would have oceurrd had not firemen promptij' burst the door open, permit ting the frenzied men to pour out into the street. The cause of the fire has not been ascertained. The building was a three-story struc ture and the majority of the lodgers were on the upper floors. At every window could be seen the forms of half-naked men, calling to firemen in terror, and a few moments later leaping from the burning building to be crushed on the sidewalk below. Life lines, fastened at windows, provided means of escape for scores of the 500 lodgers. Mystery of n Woman’s Voice.

SECOND SESSION OF 59TH BODY BEGINS LABORS. Many Question* of Great Importance Are Expected to Receive Consider ation—Minority May Force Tariff Issue to the Front. Washington correspondence: The Fifty-ninth Congress, which broke the records of achievement dur ing its first session, resumed its labors Monday. There are just three mouths of life remaining to it, and in these three mouths new questions of vital importance will be brought to the front. There are, in addition, many important measures that were hanging fir when adjournment was taken last summer, and between the new and the old. to gether with the appropriation bills that must be considered, there is a tremen dous amount of work ahead for the na tional lawmakers. Both houses were called to order at noon. After some perfunctory work adjournment was taken to await the President’s annual message on Tues day. In the House there was practi cally nothing on the first day’s pro gram. aside from the swearing in of new members who had been elected to fill vacancies. Four members have died since the adjournment in June, and resolutions were adopted and adjourn ment taken out of respect to their memory before the regular routine was begun. The Senate was ready to go ahead from where it left off five months ago. Important issues which are to com mand the attention of Congress are the following: Inheritance tax on big fortunes. Regulations of corporations. Divorce question. Race question. Cuban problem. Japanese question. Currency reform. Safeguarding of coal lands. Philippine tariff bill. Ship subsidy question. ('ampaign cont ribut ions. Postal savings banks and parcel post. Child labor prohibition. Anti-injunction bill. Government powder ractories. There is a strong probability thr.t a river ami harbor bill carrying about $60,000,000 will go through. The only obstacle will be passible opposition of the Senate should the advocates of tlit? ship subsidy measure in that body de mand that it stand or fall with the river and harbor bill. The administration earnestly desires the enactment of the House Dill re ducing the tariffs on Philippine sugar, tobacco and rice to 25 per cent of the Dingley rates, and admitting free all other Philippine products. The Senate held the measure up in the last ses sion. If the subsidy advocates in the Senate have their way. they will sup port the Philippine tariff bill and the river and harbor measure, which is to contain a provision inaugurating the proposed deep waterway from the lakes to the gulf. The Smoot ease is to, be argued in the Senate and a vote had if possible. The Santo Domingo treaty, hanging fire fe,r two years, will also receive the attention of the Senators, together with the Isle of Pines treaty. The eight-hour and anti-injunction measures, the demand for wh’i-h by or ganized labor, prompted the American Federation of Labor’s recent excursion into the political field, will come up for discussion during the session. The eight-hour bill has been favorably re ported by the House Committee e.n Labor. Speaker Cannon’s opposition has prevented it from being placed be fore the House. The anti-injunction measure which President Roosevelt has promised the labor people he will per sonally consider, is awaiting action at the hands of the Judiciary Committee of the Ho.use. The creaion of an elastic currency to meet the demands of the bankers and prevent panicky conditions, owing to periodical stringency in the money mar ket will also be discussed. The measu making more stringent the regular ~s governing the admission of alb into this ce.untry will un doubtedly become a law. The question of bigger battleships will be one of the most important ques tions to be decided. The Navy Depart ment has prepared plans for a warship to surpass the English Dreadnaught, but the question of embarking upon such a policy was left at the last ses sion to be determined at this one. There promises to be further agita tion of Cuban independence. There may be a congressional inves tigation of the government printing affice owing to the bitter personal dif ferences which appear to have devel oped between the public printer and several thousand employes. Incidental ly the matter of President Rqpsevelt’s simplified spelling order will come up. President Roosevelt will send a spe ?ial message to Congress relating to the Panama canal. Postal reforms in the matter of sec ond-class mail matter will be discussed and tberS will be the usual fight over the subsidy paid to the Southern Rail road Company for its fast mail train from Washington to New Orleans. There will be heard occasionally the voice of the tariff revisionist. He was prominent in the speaking program of the 'ast session and has not yet worn out his arguments or his voice. The wise ones say. however, that there “will be nothing doing.” The proposed restriction of Japanese immigration, advocated by Pacific coast members, will come before the House. Henryk Sienkiewicz, the Polish novel ist. has sent to British and French news papers an open letter to Emperor M illiam denouncing Prussia’s treatment of Po land. Jared Hughes, who killed his wife. Flora Hughes, and her paramour. John Parr, on Aug. 26 last, pleaded guilty to second degree murder at Portsmouth. O. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. At the annual meeting of the board nf directors of the Sydenham hospital, Sew York. Isaac Guggenheim announced that he would erect for the institution a new building to cost $500,000 if the board would guarantee to him that it would se ture for the hospital an annual income pf $50,000 to $60,000. Smiley Nebon. a wealthy dairyman re siding near Bellaire. Ohio, his wife, two children and his father-in-law. John Rob inson, are in a serious condition as a re sult of carbolic acid poisoning. While Mr. Nebon was attending to work on the premises an unknown person entered the kitchen and poured acid in the tea kettle. 

SEA’S HEAVY DEATH TOLL. Over Plfty Lives Lost This Season on SI. Lawrence Reefs. Over fifty lives were lost and nearly a score of vessels were swept to de struction on treacherous reefs and sandbars of the gulf and River SL Lawrence during the season of naviga tion now closed. Of sixty persons who perished in these waters within the last year nearly fifty met death during November, the most disastrous to ship ping in the St. Lawrence in a dozen years. The financial losses aggregated $250,000. The majority of those who perished were lost from square-rigged vessels of foreign register. The most thrilling wreck during the month was that of the Russian full-rigged iron ship Sovin to of Helsingfors, which struck on a bar off Priests Pond, P. E. 1., during a furious northeast gale, while on a voyage from Dalhousie. N. R.. for Mel bourne. Australia, with a cargo of lumber. Several of the crew were killed by the falling spars. The big ship broke in two soon after** aid and ten of the Sovinto’s men perished. Another disastrous wreck was that of the Norwegian bark Adeona of Aren dai, which was driven ashore by the same storm at Richibucto. Capt. Johan sen and, crew of ten men, one of them a German student, after remaining on board two days, evidently feared that the great seas which were constantly dashing over the vessel would smash her to pieces, and during the height of the gale they launched a boat and attempted to reach land. The boat was capsized by a comber and the en tire crew was drowned. The masts of the vessel went by the board and ev erything movable was swept into the sea. The crew would have been saved had they remained aboard ship, as the hull withstood the tremendous seas for ten days. When it was possible for a life-saving crew to reach the derelict the ship’s cat was found alive in the forecastle. The Adeona was bound from Sexton for Preston, England, with lumber. Another Norwegian hark, supposed to be the Magda, bound from Riviere Du Loup, Quebec, for Buenos Ayres, was lost with all on board. The vessel struck on Red Island reef and found ered. It is thought that the captain, his pilot and twelve men were lost. Half a dozen lives have been lost in the wrecks of schooners during the fall, but only four on board the dozen steamers stranded were drowned. MAY REPLACE FRISCO. Thonsa ii i]n Have Flocked from Slrk’krn City to Seattle. Seattle is beginning to believe that it is her destiny to become the greatest city of the Pacific coast. After the destruc tion of San Francisco an invitation was extended to the stricken people to come and make their homes here until the de stroyed city could be rebuilt. Transpor tation and temporary homes were furnish ed for those who desired to come. The result is entirely unexpected. Instead of making a temporary abiding place of Seattle, the California people have be come enamored of that city and there are hundreds of them who will never re turn to San Francisco. This has resulted,in a great boom for Seattle. The population is growing with wonderful strides and the commercial development is unprecedented. Many of the great shipping interests of San Fran cisco have transferred their headquarters to Seattle and it is an actual fact that the railroads, many of them, are quite unable to handle the great volume of business that has come to them. The railroads are realizing that Se attle has a great future and an evidence of their faith is the big extensions that are being made and the heavy purchases in the open market of the necessary land for terminal facilities. Seattle people have had their troubles with this unexpected boom. Hundreds of the wealthy people of San Francisco, who came to Seattle after the earthquake and fire, immediately set about procuring homes for themselves and they have bought houses that were always used for renting purposes and have practically forced the natives to make extraordinary efforts to shift for themselves. Rents have almost doubled and it is next to impossible to secure a house at all. llomo.H for Millions. Farming opportunities are still open to millions in the Southwest. For in stance, Texas has 172,000,000 acres, while only 14.000,000 acres are under cultiva tion. Of 20,0t)0,000 acres of available farming land in the Indian Territory, only 2,000.000 are under cultivation. Arkansas has 34,500,000 acres of farm ing land, while only 5,000,000 acres are under cultivation. Missouri, which was admitted to the Union nearly a century ago, still has 10,000,000 acres of land in the south western part of the State which is not in cultivation, and which con be pur chased at a moderate price. 11. Clay Pierce Indicted. The grand jury of the District Court at Austin, Texas, returned an indictment against H. Clay Pierce of St. Louis and New York, president of the Waters- Pierce Oil Company, on the charge that he swore falsely when he made affidavit in 1000 that none of the Watt r r Pierce stock was owned or controlleu ay the Standard Oil Company. An effort will he made to have him extradited from Mis souri. WIHon'N Body IHslnlerrefl. The body of James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and one of the framers of the federal consti tution. after lying for 108 years in a cemetery at Edenton, N. C., has been placed opposite those of his wife in the graveyard of Old Christ church, Phila delphia. A wreath on the coffin wan sent by President Roosevelt. Among the speak ers in connection with the ceremony were Messrs. Andrew Carnegie, Dr. 8. Weir Mitchell, Alton B. Parker and Attorney General Moody. Women In Clerical Ranks. Rev. Daniel Steel, referring to the statistics published in the Wesleyan Alumni Record, showing the gain in the membership of all professions excepting the ministers, proposes that the Method ist denomination shall have a ministry recruited by ordained women. He says the bishops may be authorized by general conference to do at borne what they al ready do in the foreign missions, i. e. t appoint women to the various fields of Christian labor. He would *ave the sphere of deaconesses enlarged, so as to include preaching and pastoral care and the administration of the sacraments Common Law to Strike Trnt. The Supreme Court of West Virginia decided under the common law a case which defines the powers of the people to control combinations. It was brought to enforce a contract between twenty coal and coke companies united under the name of the Pocahontas Coal Company, which became their exclusive agents. Finally six withdrew and the agents and the merging company brought suit to enforce the contract. The court now de clares that contract void as being in vio lation of common law, although the State has no special anti-trust statute. Advertise in this paper. —.—■ 

CHICAGO. In the aggregate of bank exchanges for both the week and month just end ed substantial gains appear over those oi last year, indicating that expansion in business generally is yet making pro- I gre*. Heavy orders continue to he j entered by the leading industries f>r delivery at distant dates, and consader [ insr the rapid absorption of the unpre cedented outputs of furnaces and fac tories. it is clear that consumption lias | established anew high level. More concern is expressed as to the future productions of finished materials owing to the difficulties presented by ; cost of supplies and labor and the in j ability of railroads to provide satisfac j tory transportation. These considera tions are becoming more widespread, but for the present they cause no halt ing in the efforts to obtain the best results. It is noted that iron and steel prices exhibit no further marking up, hut there is an advancing tendency in hard woods and slightly higher quotations in copper, hides and leather. Thanksgiving trade made an improv ed volume of retail dealings and. al though jobbers are seasonably quiet in the staples, the demand is well main tained for holiday goods. Wholesale houses find a satisfactory demand for spring wares, particularly in the tex tiles, footwear, carpets and furniture. Interior advices testify to gratifying headway in the reductions of winter lines and the outlook is bright for heavy Christmas business. A healthy indication is found in an increased dis counting of bills, and western collec tions average up well. Manufacturing operations reflect sus tained pressure upon facilities and greater outputs of finished products. Recent specifications for additional railroad equipment add to the forward period of activity in iron and steel and car building. Other producers have much work to keep forces busy, and there Is steadiness in demand for imple ments, heavy machinery, brass and wood working.
