The expression suggests too vividly a certain nnsanctilied New Kng land custom, for which they are under stood to entertain no loudness whatever. Death is choosing many shining marks in this closing month of the old year, and the report that Ktnperor AVilliam of (!er many is seriously ill makes probable a notable addition to the list. The age and infirmity of the emperor render It not un likely that he may be taken away ut any time. Despatches from Mexico state that President Cleveland's message had the effect of causing a decline in Mexican silver from eighty-three to elghty-ono cents on the dollar. This Is a slguillcant fact for the silver men. That was a brilliant objection of Angus M. Cannon's, that his indictment under the Kumunds law did not allege that he was a male person.

It Is only an abridged expression for a common and unabridged experience. Mr. Domain 1!. Katon's speech at the Keform club banquet In his honor, in lio.s ton, last Saturday, was an able argument for independence in political opinion and action. It advanced no new arguments, but put the old arguments into phrases which give them interest and xveiglit.

There is one matter which Congress ought to attend to at the present session, at any cost of time, and that Is to relieve theoverliurdeiied calendar of the Supreme Court accorditiK to the suggestion made by the attorney-general. As matters are now the wheels of justice in that court I are tremendously clogged. President Cleveland's viL'otous.xvords on the .Mormon question must have sounded strange to the Democrats in the House who were so strenuous in their opposition to the passage of the Kdmunds bill. They comprised very nearly all the Democrats in that body but the President's views xvill certainly meet with the approval of the country. Txx-o important bills are already before Congress Senator Kdmunds's postal tele graph bill and Senator Hoar's presidential succession bill. Hotli of them ought, and atone at least of them probably will be passed. The postal telegraph bill xvill, of course, be fought to the bitter end, but there xvill be wide-spread dissatislaction if the monopolists are allowed to block it. Nearly all the Southern States make payment of a poll tax requisite lor the en joyment ot the Irancliise. The enormous Increase of votes at Atlantic was due, in large measure, to the negro voters, whoe poll taxes were paid tor them by the op posing parties. It this requirement should be abolished, the political aspect of the South might be decidedly changed. Of course it xvill not be. abolished. It seems hardly possible that such a relic of barbarism as capital punishment .,. tllL. a.,lu, (lf stealing .should survive in any enlightened community, lint the telegraphic despatches state that two men were recently hanged in Charlotte, North j Carolina, for the crime of burglary not 1 by lynchers, but at the hands ol the law. I If North Carolina wants to come within ' hailing distance of the rctt of the world in i this era of grace she xvill promptly abolish all such barbarous features of her code. I Mr. .Joseph Cook in his recent lecture in tills city said that the murder of a few more innocent Chinese travellers and la- , borers in our western territories might ex- reprisals upon American 'mclmuts and missionaries on the part of China j The President's apology to China for these outrage", in his message, is none too humble.

There are waters enough and llsh enough for all, if the llshcrmcn could only stop wrangling and go toiiug ling, so to speak, irrespective of tlie na tionality of their bait. They are having a regular panic at New ark, N. . I., over the mad dog scare. De tails ot police armed with lassoes parade the streets, gathering in all the unmuz zled dogs, and dragging the poor animals half-choked to the city stables, where a man with a big revolver stands ready to put tlie quietus upon them as last as they are towed in. Meanxvlillu the industrious dog-poisoner is also at work, and tlie canine race is fast becoming extinct in that vicinity. No dog is bate except (Vend dog, in Xuwurk. xx e are not. living m me middle ages, but occasionally we hear of people who, like liip Van W inkle, have rather over slept. A church in Canada the church of St. Anne at Islo Pierrot recently caused the arrest of a man named Poitras lor nut using both knees In kneeling din ing prayer !

The Hoston llcmlit points out the very evident fact that in this country political preferment is almost entirely conllued to members of the legal profession.

Under tlie annual system, every representative who did not make an absolute failure as a legislator, had a re-election. If Hie system was to In- restored that practice would doubtless be restored also, and chances lor aspirants would remain tlie same. Tlie biennial system with permission to reelect a worthy governor, senator, or representa tive would be beiielkeiit and satisfactory. Hut withlthe addition of a practically In dexible one-term rule, it is neither benefi cent nor satisfactory. It gixes us inex perienced legislators and crude, expensive legislation. Vermont may not, probably xvill not, go back to the annual system ol elections : but the sooner she goes back to innual sessions of the legislattire.ou some such plan as xvas outlined by Mr. Walton at the time ol the legislative reunion, tlie better it xvill be for all concerned. There are some curious facts about the government s nuances, which come to view afresh wit li each issue of tlietreas ury report. Perhaps the most curious and jet most familiar of all is the fact that xx-e really should llnd it dillicult to et along without our great national debt. One of the greatest public calami ties which could happen to Us would be the sudden wiping out of this gieat inter est-paying national obligation. In view of this circumstance tlie American citi zen can contemplate without concern the impressive array of ligtiles repieseuting the nation's liabilities. He knows that tlie debt is in progress of gradual reduc tion ; but he also knoxvs that it xvill out last his time ; that the nation is perfectly good lor it ; and that while it lasts, it forms a linn basis for tlie banking sys tem and oilers a perlectly secure invest nient to those who can be content with a moderate rate of interest, Tlie public debt is really a great bulunce-xvheel xvliich steadies and controls the entire llnance of the country.

Tlie telegraph companies should, according to my belief, si'ect an arbitra tor, and the government choose another. If these two disagreed they ought to have a third, who should be a man thoroughly experienced mid regarded as an expert in the business.

People xvlio are 1mm ti and bred lu cllles never weary of reading idyls and issnys, depicting tlio happy existence ol the men and women who furnish their butter, eggs, and mitk. In the summer time these pent-up city (hvcllers hasten to taste, in a delightfully vicarious manner, the simple pleasures and "joy- some toils" or xvliich they have read and dreamed so much. They milk the cows while leaning oxer ll.e barnyard lence and watching the sunset's colors deepen Into dusk. They "go a haying" under the cool shade of some tree In the meadow and "garner the golden grain" by de vouring corn cake at half-past eight o'clock breakfasts, lint fanners know that there is another side to all this poet ical nonsense, anil while they areas ready to admit the real advantages and pleas ures of their calling as anybody, they are not to be deluded into endorsing Idyls of rural life for the sake of giving capital to their worthy friends, the poets, There is, undoubtedly, a sunny side, a very cheerful side, to rural life, but neither poets nor city people seem to have fastened upon it. It is not In the idealization of toil, orthe turtiingof really disagreeable things Into fancilul, or rath er fantastic, play-experiences that the farmer's pleasine Is found. It is simply in doing as other people do when they are in a mood to enjoy tlieliiselvet- ln seizing the recreations which the circumstances ot life make most available and desirable. It xxould be just about as sensible to sup pose that a business man enjoys sitting up until eleven o'clock at niulit to post up his books, as that a farmer enjoys getting up before light to milk the cows. No ; the pleasure of the farmer, like the pleasure of every naturally constituted man, comes from his avocations, not Ids vocation. The farmer is no poetical gymnast, mid he doesn't enjoy carrying a m utgage any belter than tlie average city man. Tlie time when the farmer naturally en joys liiinselt the most is dttrin the w inter uontlis, tor then he has the most, leisure mil opportunity for much-needed recrea ioii. The routine of the farm of course mist be kept up, cows do not hibeniutiyuid ihiis will not lay unless they are led ; but ne special and toll-ome labor of tlie larin -oxer until spring. The plow in nine ases out of ten is Iro.en in the lurrow, ,d the hoe it either "hanging on the vail" or leposing under some snow bank. ( is at this season that the firmer can j viileii ids acquaintance xvitli books one 1 l t lie most delightlul of recreations to one lio-e daily toll is xvitli the hands and not if brain. Social life also invites him to isle its pleasures. Kven the little circle 't neighbors, and friends whom lie meets it the church entertainment or at home, iroiuleiis his outlook upon life,. -iilniitsliim hi a little wider circle of human ex- iienence, calls out n little more lunisell, makes him feel that he xxas in- tided to bea sin-ial being, ilid that the borders ol his In,, u allv reach out bevoml , i,,,,, ' ,,, e haps he manages to i lie family circle. 1 leave the farm lor a little while, and get i glnup-e of the broader world outlying his own community. City people would be surpri-ecl to know how much more real poetry, how much more idyllic enjoy ment, the farmer gets from a foi l night's triii to the metropolis than from a whole season of cutting hay and doing farm - work before hreakfa-t. The real joys of farm life, then, aie those experiences which complement it, not those which make up tlie prosaic. everyday substance of it. Poets may not be able to see it In this light, but they soon would if tliev had to farm lor a living. Senator I .(1 in u nd s'-. Latest .Mormon Hill. The Mormon church was incorporated under Uie laws of the so called "State of Deseret," at the time when lirighain Young was made its governor by Presi dent Hiiclianan, and was vested Willi al most unlimited political powers within its jurisdiction. The new Kdmunds bill provides that these powers shall be re pealed by act of Congress-; that a com mission be appointed by the President to take charge of the temporal niruirs of Un church, and that the attorney general shall be authorized to institute and prose cute proceedings to forfeit and escheat to the United .States all of the property own ed by the Mormon church, xvitli the ex ception of the buildings used for public worship; and the secretary of tlie interi or is further empowered to sell the pro petty thus forfeited and invest the pro ceeds for the benefit of the public schools. 'I he "Perpetual Kmigraut Kiind Compa ny," also incorporated under the laws of the State of Deseret, is to be disposed of in the same manner. The United States attorney general is empowered to dissolve the corporation, pay its debts, dispo-e of its property and devote the proceeds to the benellt of the public schools. The constitutionality of these .stringent meas ures is based upon the principle of the absolute doiniiion of tlie United States in its territories. The mpc'Jiim fn tin jicrlii of Utah is the Mormon church with its political powers, and institutions fun damentally opposed to the spirit of the constitution. As such, the government not only has the right to repeal the laws incorporating the sect, but it is its duty to do so. Such an institution us tlie Mor mon church cannot long exist under the laws ot the United States. One orthe other must give way xvliich shall It be This question is answered by the bill. The Mormon chinch a political menace, be sides a social blot In the history of tins country must go, Tlie way to get rid of it Is to strike at the root. We have been lopping its branches long enough, only to llnd that its vitality Is so great that prun ing adds toils friiittulni-s.s. Senator Kd munds's bill will be bitterly and strongly opposed, but sooner or later it will have to become law, If we are to rid ourselves of "the .Mormon monster." Nothing less stringent will do away with the gigantic evil against which it is directed. The New York Wiirlil has news from Oregon, that United States Judge Daxvne, xvho is supposed to have been tlio incap able and unlit appointee, referred to lu some correspondence, between a disgusted endorser and the President which was made public some mouths ago, has skip ped from Sitka, with somo eciu.ooo. Var ious swindling transactions are attributed to Ditwne, and forgery Is hinted at. Things seems to bo pretty dark about this Daxvne, DlslVanclilsed People. An article with the above ca tiou lu the A'o fi Amrrlntu Hi rli id Is nttraellng considerable attention. It 'was xvritlen bv thu editor of the '( rial; from thilu furnished by a ! special representative, and deals with the I biws governing I he legal l ighl or persons paying unl.x poll taxes to vote in the Stale of Delaxvaie. It seems that ever since the admission or Delaware into the Union as a Stale, voters have been compelled to P-'i-V poll tax In order to secure the privilege of voting. A very few days are allowed for tills duly, and ir the citizen M'oes not llnd tlie lax collector, which Is 1 often ilillictilt, he may bo disfranchised for two years. Under this arrangement Delaware is really controlled by a minor ity of its citizens, Dev. Kdxvard Kverett Hale aptly calls It an oligarchy, in xvliich a minority Is able to suppiess the ma jority. It Is In this way that the Democrats have managed to hold control of the State legislature for so long. In the present legislature the Republicans have two Sen ators and no Representatives. Democratic poll-tax voters, living for tlie most part in tlie large centres of population, where registration privileges are more accessi ble lhau in the rural districts and more closely looked after by party managers, have the advantage over Republican voters of the same class in the towns nnd villages. Often the latter llnd it next to impossible to seciile the privi lege of voting, in the brief period allotted for the payment of poll taxes. In time under tlie light and pressure of public opinion, this tuny be changed. Certainly it should be the endeavor of all legisla tors to make the duty of voting as easy as possible to the citizen. No unnecessary obstacles should be thrown in the way of any class properly entitled to the Iran chise. The patriotism of most men it not of a character lofty enough to ensure their exercise of the right to vote in the face of legal restrictions. Delaware should en franchise its voters.

But who has ever ob jected to the extension of mail routes ami establishment of postollices, as the coun try has grown, because it increased the number of place-holders ? The govern ment wants its business done, and the people want it done etliciently and faith fully. They expect that men enough xvill be provided to do it. The transfer of a few hundred operators from the olllces of the Western Union to tlie postollices, need not alarm anybody. The public practical ly supports them now, and pays in addi tion large profits to the owners of the monopoly.

Secretary Manning has followed up the announcement in lilt report that he should return to the consideration of the practical operation of the customs laws, by publishing a bulky volunie'ot s;id pages, addressed to the Speaker of the House. This is devoted to reportsof investigations of the methods of collecting customs, both at home and abroad, together with sug gestions for remedying some of the prac tical dilliculties in tlie way of honest collections. Secretary Manning linds our system of collecting customs full of abuses, lie submits an imposing array of statistics, tables, reports, etc., to prove his point, and while we can not but think that he has rather overdone the matter, it would be foolish to deny that he has ex posed .some irregularities and objection able features in our customs service. One of the principal points to which this docu ment calls attention It the pernicious sys tem of consular fees for the verification and certification of invoices, now in vogue. "Tlie consular service has degenerated," says Secretary Manning, "by reason of the scramble for fees xvliich the present system provokes or allows. The service has In a great measure suffered a loss of respect abroad, and has come to be a regu lar part of the booty, looked for by none too .scrupulous local politicians at home," Mr. Manning xxould remedy the scram ble by .substituting adequate salaries for the fees, when the consuls are paid by the latter. Tills Is directly in line with re coinuiendatlon.s heretofore made by lead ing Republican statesmen and journals, that consular salaries be so arranged that their compensation shall not be dependent to any extent upon lees. And It is thought that the fees, If houeMly account ed for, will be nearly or quite enough in amount to cover the cost of fair salaries for the consuls. The general character of the latter has got t ) be considerably im proved, however, or the government will be beat out of a good many of its dues. t'l ItSON XI, AM)

Ill the .-euate yesterday Mr. Hoar from the committee on judiciary reported favorably the bill fixing the salary of United States district judge at s.Mloo. At .;2Hii message was re ceived from the President, tiaiisinitting the Keiley correspondence recently called for. Ity Mr. Dawes to regulate the rates of postage on second-class mail matter, providing that if deposited in letter car riers olllces lor delivery by curriei-. it shall have an ttnilorm rate (if one cent per pound. Among yesterday's nominations were John (ioode, Virginia, for solicitor gen eral ; Robert A. Howard, Arkansas, tor assistant attorney-general ; Francis Whar ton, Pennsylvania, for examiner of claims lor tlie department of State. The Keiley correspondence begins with a letter to Secretary Bayard lroni Huron Kava, Ital Ian minister resident, dated April la, lss,-,, in xvliich he calls tlie attention to an edi tonal in the New York Herald in refer ence to alleged utterances ot A. M. Keiley, appointed minister to Italy, lu regatd to that government, and says if the state ment is true it is a most regietable one. Secretary liayiinl replied among other things that the deli-iidant could not make editorials of new.spapers in relation to alleged utterances, loiirteen years pre vious ot a gentleman selected tj represent the government in a foreign country, the basis of ilicust.m The Secretary goes on to say that the gox eminent sought to fiillil its honorable and amicable duty towards the Italian gov ernment and it is unnecessary to sug gest that having prollered a gentleman of the highest personal character and who entertained no other sentiments to xx arils Italy than those of en tire respect" and friendship, nothing further devolves on the United States. Mr. Keiley details the circumstances un der which he made the utterances in rein tiou to tlie occupation of Rome and tlie consequent dethronement of the l'ope at a public meeting at Richmond in January, IsTI, and says he does not pretend to be indilleretit to the settlement of the mat ter, but he is yet absolutelvat the disposal of the Secretary of State. Mr. Kava then replies Unit it would be better for Mr. Keiley not to go to Italy as he might find the situation uncointortable, alter his ebullition of sentiment. The latter soon resigned lii.s olllce. On .May 4, when Secretary llayard in formed Huron Sclmeller, the Austrian minister at Washington, that the Presi dent had appointed Keiley to succeed Mr. Francis at Vienna, it was learned that here too as in Rome were scruples against him. Count Kalnoky, on learning that Mr. Keiley would not be stopped en rottto to Austria, had instructed tlie baron to say that "This nomination will doubtless be attended with great dlllicully, and the new minister will Hud himself placed in a mos painful situation upon Ids arrival in Vienna." Secretary ISayard then proceeds to say : Tlie question tlius raised by our govern nient involves principles ot the greatest iiiip.'rtance and has no precedent. 1 am Instructed by the President, to in lorni your government through ou that the ground upon which it Is announced that usual ceremonial cotirtesv and formal respect are to to withheld from this envoy of United Mates to our gov e-niiient that is to say because His wile Is alleged by your government to entertain certain religious tuith and to be the mem her of a certain religious sect cannot be as seated to by tiiu executive of tlie govern ment of the American people.
