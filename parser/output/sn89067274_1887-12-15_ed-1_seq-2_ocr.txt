THE LEDGER. L I. TUTS, mil 13D FSOFBIETOt THURSDAY, DEC 15, 1887. Of course the bosses howl when the masses are allowed to speak. The Ledger is no manVorgan; " it gives the news and that is what hurts some folks. Our contemporary don't like the way .the Ledger is edited. It has good reason to complain. Blaine's attack on Cleveland's message is a bid for the nomination he will get it and more, i. c, get beaten . The President's message was re ceived with favor everywhere ex cept in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Hardly a respectable minority. Cigarette smoking is causing the death of a good many boys and young men. There are a few boys in Mexico who, if they do not stop, will either die or go to the insane asylum. The oflical majority against the Prohibition amendment in Oregon is 7,985, in a total vote of 37,000. The friends of Prohibition are not dismayed, but propose to keep at it, and try it again. A number of New York clergy men are out in a protest against spending so much money on the dead in ostentatious funerals and monuments when so many living need it much more. Sensible. M. Y. Duncan agreed to abide by the result of the church trial. The report has been served on him and "he accepts it, making such concessions as ho thinks his duty." The report completely exonorates Eld. Higbee. Cor,. Gentry, of Sedalia, is fa vorably spoken of all over the State as a candidate for State Treasurer. Gentry is one of Mis souri's worthy young Democrats and has a host of warm friends everywhere. In order to maintain four million young men under arms, who an robbed from the productive in dustrics to be kept in enforced and irksome idleness, Europe pays an nually $2,500,000, which is wrung in greatest measure from the work- ingman. It is no wonder that an archy is bred there. Every citizen in Mexico is inter ested in Hardin College and its needs. The movement to raise a fund to erect a chapel should be encouraged by all. A chapel must be built. The entertainments being given by the committee are worth the money asked, and you are helping a good cause. Ella Wheeler Wilcox sings "Theseasons are made by the heart, I hold, and not by outdoor heat or cold." And yet we advise Ella not to venture out without hef wraps and rubbers during the approach ing snow-storms. A warm heart is a good thing theoretically, but a aonlfilrin earlr is nnt tr. Vie ftnAP7fH at in winter. The Republican National Con vention i3 to be held in Chicago on tee 19th of Juue. This is well. Chicago has worked hard and spent a great deal of money to acquire a reputation as a town offering sup erior facilities for the accommoda tion of National Conventions and it deserves the distinction. Besides, it was shown in 1884 that the . friends of Blaine could turn out as vociferous a gallery crowd in Chica go as can be desired. . 

REPORT OP TRIAL. The report of the church trial will be made to-night. We learn some of the members want it pub lished and some do not. The re port will appear in the Ledger provided the church makes up its mind to have it published and fur nishes the copy. Of course the Ledger is anxious to give the news, but at the same time does not propose to keep this matter stirred up any more lhan necessa ry. The report will appear in the Ledger if the church furnishes a copy for publication, as was stated in the opening of the trial. A Boston jury has decided that a cigar is a drug, and therefore that an apothecary can sell one on Sun day whhout violating the law. The - verdict is very similar to that once secured by Tom Marshall in Ken tucky, to the effect that "seven up" is not a game of chance, but a game of skill. " The decision was arrived at by pitting the unskilled against the skilled players among the jury for moneyed Btakes. The defendant, charged with gambling by means of a game of chance, was acquitted. Perhaps the j ury in Boston smoked some of the apothe flftrv'a ciirara. The Jones alley is liable to cause more trouble in the future than it has done even in the past. The City Attorney was ordered last night to look into the matter of alleys in that block and see if the alley running east and west, on which J. J. Steele's store-room is located, does not belong to the city. Steele says this alley was vacated in ; return for which the Lowry ' nine north and south. . It will be set up in answer to this that "the Lowry heirs " could not deed the ' alley running north and south be- When this question wiu De set tled, or what the result will be we are unable to state, but we are sure the matter is to be at once sifted to the bottom and forever settled. Tn OUTLOOK, Will U le Dry?-Seme Political Poiutera From a GtfuUe-rttftft Away From Home, Correspondent" tI tb tedser, Watson, Ark., IKk 7, I no ticc that the political pot is Wgtn ninjr to simmer, cspovinUy iu tht Seventh district. No matter what may hv the in formation of the Lkihsku or Jleh l'njcncti; tho "Ohostiriu-ld of Au drain" will be in tho field again. Montgomery county will nlao come to the front, not with her saplings, but with her heavy tim ber, in the person of tho lion. Tom Powell, of New Florence, who pos sesses, to a superlative degree, the qualifications llufe Anderson claimed for his father, and tho man who gets to Congress over Tom Powell, of New Florence, may con gratulate himself. Judge Norton will not be a candi date for re-election. This gives a place for the Lord Hardwukc of the Missouri bar, M. Y. Duncan, who is ripe for judicial honors; and it goes without saying that he make a No. 1 Supreme Judge. The candidates for county officers have not been named. I trust the race tor coroner will be lett to White, of the Ledger, and Cook, of the Intelliqencer, and upon i square race between these gentle men, the people may determine which shall hold inquest upon the bodies of the political dead, killed by their pens. Mr. Editor, no matter whether you may win or lose in the race for coroner, continue the pencil. Make the Ledger's influence wider and :onger. Without a boom we can have no boom. If going wet wont make a boom try going dry awhile, and let the world know that Mexico has legitimate business and pluck enough to live and grow without revenue from dram-shop license When the life of a city becomes dependant upon the existence of a tempter to the young men and boys, and vending destruction to homes and happiness, and taking bread and clothes from the help less, there should be a change. Going to church and grunting when the 'preacher groans, and amening at his periods, or express ing concern for the men and youths on the lightning express of intem perance to destruction, or express ing sympathy for the drunkard's family, or-growling at the dram shop Keeper whose business is made lawful by license, will all go for naught, so long as you sell to the dram shop keeper all that in temperance destroys, and receive in return all the evils that intern perance produces, and a little rev enue from the license to boom the town. Wives, mothers, daughters and sisters have rights, natural God given rights, and among these are wives to have sober husbands mothers sober sons, sisters sober brothers, daughters sober fathers and when it can be truly said that in Mexico these rights are secured we will have a boom, not founded upon liquor-moistened sand, but upon the rock of sobriety. Bob what do you say to going dry awhile? X. J. P. The Seventh District. J. K. M iuiHn in VersaillesStatesmaii, The friends of Col. Hutton, Con gressman from the 7th district of Missouri, state positively that he will not be a'candidate for re-election. The action of the Democratic Congressional convention of 1886 foreshadowed this when the second successive dead-lock in that district occurred. Audrain, the home of Hutton, will be practically solid for a Pike county man, with Hut ton out of the way. In the last convention there was a "scramble" for the nomination. Nearly every county had a candidate. The Pike county delegation (the strongest in the district) took in the situation, and when the time came that Pike's vote would nominate a harmless and unobjectionable man, they "went for him thar and then." His name was Hutton and he was nominated.. Without tliis unex pected break on the part of Pike Hutton would not have received the nomination. Pike was satis fied with Audrain's guarantees for 1888. And now, mark ye, the next member of Congress from the Seventh Missouri Congressional district will be Judge Elijah Robin son, of Pike county. , Freer Trade Wanted. It is not Free Trade hut a freer trade that President Cleveland favors. He urges that some of the need less war shackles be removed and this not upon any theoretical or philosophical ground, but as an incident of stopping the surplus revenue. None of the fathers of the system of protection ever deemed or dream ed that a tariff average of nearly 50 per cent, was essential to the build iug np of American industries. A maximum duty of that amount and an average of 30 per cent, would have seemed monstrous to them. At the outbreak of the war the average duty was but. 18.84 per cent. In 1863, when we had a mil lion soldiers in the field and a great war to sustain,-the average duty was but 32.62 per cent. -. And yet now, when our ."infant industries' are many of them more than half a century old, and the war has been over fcr nearly a quarter of a century, the average duty is above 49 per cent., and the customs collections last year ex ceeded those of 1867 by more than $40,000,000. : ; It is time for lighter taxes and freer trade, "- Th wm opposes Vrawl on alinnerv -wtuuh We want to nominate lh Wst HMt fop tUt lae. u e on't want to nominate a man hooansw h tW or dot' not ive in ww imnuMilor portion of the SUtt, bvit because hi? the Wi material, Mexloo Lkpukk, The n who uppot Ki'aih'U on thta ground are lacking in polltlwU ewgaelty.

Let the party select its most worthy and competent men, whether they come from St. Louis, Kansas City or the remotest corner of the State. This hue and cry about Francis being a St. Louis man, and because of this fact, he should be discarded and some other man from the interior of the State selected in his stead is mere "moonshine." Mayor Francis,if chosen Governor, will administer the affairs of Mis souri in a fair and equitable man ner, and no true-blue Democrat will ever have cause to regret selecting him as their Governor. Rocheport Commercial. A certain lady suspected that her husband was in the habit of kissing the cook a pretty German girl, by the by and resolved to detect him in the act. After watch ing four days, she heard him come in one evening and gently pass through into the kitchen. .Now, Kate was out that evening and the kitchen was dark. Burning, with jealousy, the wife took some matches in her hand, and, hastily placing her shawl over her head, as Kate often did, she entered the kitchen by the back door, and was almost immediately seized and embraced and kissed in the most ardent manner. With her heart almost bursting with rage and jealousy the injured wife prepared to administer a terrible rebuke to her faithful spouse. Tearing htr- seu irom ms emorace, Bhe struct: a match and stood face to face with Katie's beau one of the factory boys.

The Ohio Democrats in Congress oppose the President's views on the wool tariff, while the Texas Democrats who represent wool- growing districts, say that no mat ter what the effect may be on wool, they will stand by the party and revenue reform. Where a man comes from does make a difference. Mme. Path sends word to her American friends that she loves them all and longs to return to them "they are so enthusiastic."
