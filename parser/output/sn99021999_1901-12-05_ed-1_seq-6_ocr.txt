SKCUETAUV OAGrS HKlH)nT. There Is a great deal of useful Infor mation for the tlnanclal nnd business In terests of the country Iu tho annual re port of the secretary of the treasury. The genernl public will be chiefly In terested In the recommendation that revenue be reduced. The Indications are that at the-nd of the current llscal year, June HO,' 1IKK!, tho surplus will reach $ KH.i.OOO.lHK) and Secretary (Inge Is of the opinion that It will be safe to reduce revenue to the extent of $r0,000, 000. He recommends tho repeal of all tho miscellaneous taxes known ns wnr taxes, saying of them that "they are in their .nature vexatious, In some Instances op pressive and, separately ' considered, yield but small revenue." Pcrhnps con gross will not be djsposod to cut off so much revenue as the secretary of the treasury suggests, though there Is no doubt It could be donu with entire safety, but It must make some .reduction, or the party in power will certainly suffer In tho congressional elections next year To continue tuxes that lire vexatious and oppressive when tho national treas ury Is accumulating money at tho pres cut rate cannot be Justified. It Is true there will bo heavy expenditures by tho government In new enterprises, but these should not be so large as to re tpilre tho revenue the gov ernment Is now getting. The people should be relieved of unnecessary .taxation and iu the In terest of tho business of the country the great Mow of money Into the nntlonal treasury should bo chocked as soon as It Is practicable to do so, which will be at the beginning of tho next llscal yenr. Secretary Gage urges modlllcatlons of thu national banking law, . with a view to enabling th'e banks to Increase their note circulation, It Is the asset cur rency plan and Iho secretary of the treasury thinks It would result In a large addition to the bank note currency, at the .same time relieving the govern ment of the necessity of carrying so largo an amount or gold as at present for redemption of legal tender notes, the plan contemplating the .impounding of greenbacks. The asset currency Idea has been pretty fully discussed ami does not appear to have made a generally favorable Impression. Mr. Dau'os, the former comptroller of the currency, ex pressed tho opinion that asset currency such as Is proposed In current plans Is unsafe and that the need of an asset currency In tho transaction of current business Is not great enough to Justify any radical change In oftr .system of bank note issue. It Is very probable that tills view will bo found to prevail among a majority In coiigivs. The matter may receive consideration, but It Is safe lo say that the recommendation or Secretary Gage will not.be acted upou. Tho secretary submits argument Tor an American merchant marine, recom mending legislation providing for the carrying of ocean .malls lu American steamships, Tor which he says the time Is opportune and the conditions propi tious. "There Is 110 longer any reason," says Mr. Gage, "why we should bo de pendent on the auxiliary navies of Kuropeau fpovers for our ocean mall service." He argues that the establish niifnt of a complete American ocean mall service to lOurope, Asia, South America and Australia will in Itself furnish the backbone for an American system of communication by sea. It Is very prob able that congress will take favorable action upon this recommendation of tho secretary of the. treasury, which Is en tirely sound and practicable. 

I.MPOUTAKCK OK llllttGATIUX. It Is a inost. encouraging fact lu con nection with the Irrigation question that today there Is a great deal of eastern sentiment In favor of the reclamation of tho arid regions. Wo referred only a few days ago to the expressions of one of the leading dally papers of the east to this subject. In which It eloquently and .forcibly urged the duty of the govern ment to do something for reclaiming the arid lands, most conclusively show ing that In doing that It would be con tributing lu an Inestimable way to tho building up of tho national welfare. Another eastern paper, the Haltlmoro News, iu discussing this subject, says: "There Is an empire In the west which for years to como will serve as a home for the overllow for the teeming popula tion of the east, provided pains are taken lo make ayallablo tho natural re sources of Hint empire. While Ameri cans are talking reciprocity and seek ing foreign trade, they should not over look the fact that a market may bo developed at home through the reclaim ing of the arid west which would de mand more manufactured goods prob ably than all of the foreigners with which we do business." There Is cert 11 Inly a very practical Idea In this that Is worthy of most, seri ous consideration. This great arid re gion of our own country, the reclama tion of which Is unquestionably feasi ble,, ami which Is capable of supporting when reclaimed a population almost If not equal to tho present population of the country, presents a proposition that ought to command attention second to none other with which congress has to deal.. THE 

ISTUMUX CASALIWPMIT. The report of the Isthmian Canal com mission, now before congress, discloses nothing the public was not already In formed f. U iiuqualltlcdly favors tho Nicaragua route ns being In nil respects preferable to Panama. A canal through Nicaragua, according to the .commis sion, can bo constructed In less time than would be required to complete tho Panama canal and will cost consid erably less, taking Into account what would havo to be paid tho Pannnm compnny, which Is a very much larger sum than It has been supposed Unit company would ask. Tho estimated cost of completing the Panama canal Is also much larger than any hereto foro made, but It must be assumed that In this matter tho commission was care ful not to overestimate, It Is safe to predict, however, thnt Its llgurcs will bo challenged as too high. .The esti mated cost of the Nicaragua canal Is considerably In excess of thnt of tho previous commlsslou and undoubtedly Is u more trustworthy estimate, though very likely several million below what the canal will cost. 'I he report of the conimIslon will doubtless put nu end to discussion In regard to routes, since further contro versy N manifestly useless. There Is no doubt that a large majority In con gross favor the Nicaragua route and when the bill for the construction of a canal Is Introduced there will be llttlo delay In passing- It. The commission recommends that thn government nc quire control of territory ten miles wide from sea to sen and expresses the opln Ion thnt there will bo no dlltlculty lu arranging terms with Nicaragua nnd Costa Ulea. We shnll doubtless hnvc to pay handsomely, however, for so much territory. There seems to bo noth ing now lu the way of carrying out this great enterprise. The trenty with (heat Itrltaln concedes everything our government has asked, the protocols with Nicaragua and Costa Hlca assure a satisfactory arrangement with those countries, which It Is presumed are anxious to havo the canal built, and we have the money to carry on tho work Such being the situation there Is no np parent reason why tho enterprise should not take practical form early In the coming year. A'ECBS.S'Tl or HUTUKNCUMCST. The paramount question thnt Inter csts tho taxpayers of Omalin and Uoug Ins county Is tnx reduction. The bur den of tnxntlon M'lilch has been grow ing heavier from ycnr to ycnr must be lightened lu some way before any con sldernblo rlso lu the market value of real estate can bo hoped for. There are only two ways by which this relief enn be had. One Is by grcntcr economy nnd retrenchment In the management of county, city nnd school affairs the other by a more equitable distribution of tho tnx burdens through the assessment of corporate property ami ffranchlses and personal property that have heretofore been undervalued or escaped taxation altogether. Y Itli the new year the llrst step should be taken by city, county and school governments by the Abolition of sinecures and the application of busi ness methods In all departments. While none of the local authorities can change the law creating permanent olllcers and Ilxlng their salaries, there Is a largo Held where the pruning knife can be applied with good effect without Im pairing tho elllclency of the service. In due time the largest saving can be effected by the school board through a thorough rearrangement of the system, which Is top-heavy and needs readjust ment at tho base. ( The more serious dlllleulty will be oiuountered In the effort to equalize tho tax assessments so that the consti tutional provision requiring every cor poration and Individual to pay .taxes In proportion to both properly and fran chises shall be enforced without favorit ism or discrimination. With reasonable retrenchment a reduction of from $30, 1)0(1 to ? 100,000 can be made for the coming year .In the total of city, county anil school taxes. An Impartial as sessment would without question add several million dojlars to the grand as sessment roll, with a corresponding re duction of the tax rate. If the property owners of Omaha and its business organizations can get. to gether to work out a plan designed .with this end In view, they can accomplish n great deal without waiting for tho aid or consent of any legislature or consti tutional convention. The report of the state auditor shows that the Indebtedness of the slate is and has been for n number of years Increas ing at the rate of $100,000 per yenr. So far as the ultimate result lo the state Is concerned, it Is Immaterial whether this represent) regular or extraordinary ex penses. Such a condition may bo good business, but in private affairs It would soon lead to the bankruptcy court." If there were no other reason than this condition, It would be a good Investment to have a special session of the legisla ture, which could devise means to .re establish the state's llnanccs on a solvent basis. If the friends of Irrigation could per suade Commissioner .Maxwell not to project himself too far Into tho front In the discussion of tho Irrigation problem before congress they would materially Improve the chances for the pnssngo of a ratlonnl bill. It Is as well .known In Washington ns It Is In Omaha that Mux- well Is not agitating this subject for his health, but that he Is the hired repre sentative of heavy Interests, and ,such men seldom wield much Influence. London papers comment upon the fact that every nation In Europe envies tho United States Its treasury surplus and each ono rejoices thnt no other country possesses It A treasury surplus of that size to back up some of the ambitions of Kurope would be an endless fiourco of trouble for other nations. Tho United States Is content, however, to put up a "Keep off tho grass" sign nnd allow Kurope to worry along with Its own troubles. The Heal Kstate exchange hns suc ceeded In unloading tho Grcntcr Omaha consolidation scheme on n committee of fifteen .citizens and that committee hns turned over the tnsk to a sub-committee of live dlstlnguMied gentlemen qualified In legal lore, but thnt fact should not deter the members of the exchongo from devising some plan thnt will bring about a reduction of .taxes under the existing county, city and school hoard manage ments. A certain class of Cubans seek for n pretext for believing the United States Intends to obtrude Itself Into purely Cuban affairs with the persistency of a woman who has looked for a man under the bed every night of her life.

Jenkins, governor of Oklnhoma, becauso It was shown by his own statement that Jen kins hnd made an arrangement by which ho would reap a benefit amounting to $10, 000 or more front a contract between tho territory- nnd a sanitarium company which was to care for tho Insane of tho territory. Mr. Iloosevelt lu his letter saya: "A chancellor would not for a moment retain n trusteo who, In dealings for tho trust, re served an advantage for himself. The thought Is not to be tolerated thnt the president can be leas vigilant and exacting In the public's Interest." This Is tho wholo case In a nutshell, nnd Is Just what was expected of tho president. Mr. HooHcvelt has often in public speeches declared thnt the samo rules of honesty and fair dealing should prevail In transacting thn business of the people that aro ob served In tho dealings of one man with an other Hnd his actions In public offlco have been squared Btrlctly In accordance with this principle. The politicians' are finding out that thor havo In tho president, a man to donl with who la courageous and who will go to tho root of any mnttcr whenho glvea his de cision. One of the great curses of American poli tics, especially' in cities, Is tho "rnkeoff." The chief aim some politicians havo In securing office ts to get n much ns pos. stbie out of every contract for work done for tho people and for which the people pay In taxes. It has como to pass In some localities hnt a man's worth to his party Is valued' by his shrewdness In robhlntr a city of all ho can without being discovered and his supporters strive to keep him In office, having nn eye to mutual profit. It Is not to bo wpndered at that those, who profit by tho rakcoff die hard in politics. The astounding pnrt of tho business Is thnt people anywhere In tho country unbuilt to being held up and robbed by thoso they would decllno to trust In nny ordinary transaction of prlvnto business.

A great deal might be said regarding the future of transportation facilities as a re sult or the "community of Interest" deals. Tho question resolves itself Into two parts; first, will tho public Interests bo served as well ns at present If a number of great sys tems nre united and kept under private management; and, second, will the public Interests bo served as well as at present If a number of great systems aro united and placed under the control of tho govern ment? On tho first point wo have our doubts. Past experience has shown that when a number of roadB traversing the same section of country havo been welded together Under ono management, the public havo speedily begun to complain of n cur tailment of privileges. Human nature be ing what It is, wo Incline to the opinion that the northwest In particular and the country In general have more to be afraid of than to rejoice over, In connection with the transportation situation, ns a result of such deals as the ono Just consummated by Messrs. Morgan, Hill and Hnrrlman. The cose becomes different, however, when we look nt tho transportation problem In the light of government ownership. We do not attach much Importance to the argument, so commonly advanced, that the railroads would be less efficiently managed under government control than tinder private con trol. It amounts to a certainty In our mind that tbo railroads would be as effectively handled by the government as tho Post- office department now Is, and that Is saying a good deal. Government will give the people all that the people Insist upon It giving them. In tomo things the people are tolerant and al low the government to pursue a shiftless course, but not In matters which they know for a certainty affect their pocketbooks. Tho people of the United Stales allow the government to draw from them every year an extravagant amount of money to be spent In usolebB ways, but they do not eon- sqlously permit tho authorities at Wash ington to do anything that will impede the operation of their various Industrial pur suits. They think they know what they need and they make the sovemment give them exactly what they think they want. Now, In the matter of railroad privileges the public know what they need and under government control of the railroads they would unquestionably get what they wanted, The government could not tam per with tho rnllroadj, even If It wanted to; Its shortcomings would bo too easily detected and too quickly denounced to ad mit of tho supposition that the roads would be managed In other than a most efficient manner. Consequently, we do not believe that the public would bo losers, from the point of view of transportation facilities, if the outcomes of tbe Northern Securities company deal should be to turn the rail roads Ib question over to the government of the United States. Whether the gov ernment would be Justified In taking them at the prices which the present owners would be likely to Insist on, Is quite an other question. No doubt a moat audn clous attempt will be made "to stick the government," It; over tho question of state ownership of the railroads comes actively to tbe. frost. Reclaiming" the West Hrooklyn America high destiny Justifies the exten- sion 01 us principles over new lands; 11 Justifies tho accessions of nllcn territory and tho preachment to atrango peoples of doctrines which will lift them out of bar- bnrlsm and Idleness, but, surely, It calls for tho redemption of its own territory before nny other thing.

And, nlbclt thero was a tlmo wnen a proposition of that sort would havo been as nwo-lnsplring as the turning of tho Atlantic Into tho Sahara, the experiences of tno past score of years have shown It to ho entirely feasible. in tne east we are sweeping away our forests, mile on mile, exterminating' thu spruce, tho pine and poplar, to feed tho sawa and pulp mills, and aro thereby ex- posing the soli to tho blare, of the sun, destroying tho vegetablo mold, converting me nuis to eminences or rock that nre this great conversion of the American dc.1 washed baro by rains Instead of storlug f t, tho gain, that Is. to settlers and to tho tnem and causing tho country to suffer from extremes or urouta in summer and from noous in spring, nut It Is hopeful of tho tuiuro or tno country that, whllo this do- vnstatlon goes on In tho older states, the newer ones are applying tho scientific cor- rocuon ror these evils nnd are even aiding naturo In planting.

It has been n matter of surprise to tho Investigators to find thnt arid land wna tho best land, Tho desert has not partgd with Its atores of nutritious mat ter, augmented as they have been by the vast herds of animals that hnvc traversed them, nnd they nwalt only tho mnglc of mols- turo to burst Joyously Into bloom. In Egypt and other countries, where Irrigation Is necessary to producn crops, the yield Is more abundant than In areas of correspond- Ing size that depend on rnlns.

Tho settler has often to contend with salt, but that Is readily soluble and easily washed out of the ground. Hero then Is raw material of fertility abounding. It would bo absurd lu this people not lo use them. It does not Imply expenditures for manures In order to obtain n yield of crops. Every river that 'courses through the country Is turbid with mineral riches.

HITS Ol' AVASlll.NRTON LIFE. 1 Ktchln of Men and Kvrnta 1 the XntlmiRl CnpKnl. Much adverse comment has been pro voked by the unusual display of flowers on the desks of members nt the opening of congress. In quality, variety nnd quantity of floral offerings the display surpassed that of former years. Senators were particu larly favored, some members being hidden behind banks of blossoms, The Chicago Tribune correspondent says the display was "especially distasteful to alt tho older mem bers, particularly In view of the fact that this wbb the first time they had como to gcther officially since the terrtblo tragedy at Buffalo. Hundreds and probably thou sands of dollars wero. wasted on flowers for hard-headed statesmen, moat of them men beyond middle age, and all ot them looking exceedingly foolish as they peeped out from behind their floral Intrenchmcnts. "Tho result was a vast amount of talk among the senators themselves looking to ward thn adoption of a rule forbidding the display of floral gifts within tho senate chamber. Many of tho most elaborate pieces, ns Is well known, como from needy sycophants In the departments, who hope In this way to curry favor with their sena tors." The guides who steer tourists about Washington to tho various places of Inter est havo a new attraction to offer to their patrons now. When they spy a party of sightseers nnd havo failed to Bccure en gagements by offering tho usual Induce ments they ask; "Would not you like to see tho Roosevelt children?" Most of tho tourists 'admit that they would, and tho guide, starts off as though ho were leading tho way to a cngo in which tho children were kept for exhibition pur poses. Tho tourists aro tnken to tho White House nnd Into Iho east room, tho southern windows of which look out on tho prlvnte lawn of tho While Houso. Pulling aside tho curtains the guide peers out and ns genorally there aro several of the presi dent's numorous family out In tho yard, he will say; "There, Indies nud gentlemen, Is little Kermlt, the president's son," or "little Ethel, the president's dnughtcr," as tho case may bo, Tho presidential children have become used to this scrutiny. They pay no attention to tho visitors, and If they aro digging In nn old flower bed they keep right on turning up the earth as though the east room windows were not filled with Interested spectators. Visitors to the capltol last week saw a novel sight, which at first caused some alarm from Its resemblance to a fire. A fire onglno was at work out In the plaza sending a st remit of water on the marble walls of tho splendid building. The dust, the Eng lish sparrow, and his more agreeable con gener, the common homo pigeon, In the course ot tho year, manage to soil the whllo walls, and nothing short of tbe power ful pumps of one of the best engines In tho city will wash the grime and filth away. A force of firemen clad In rubber boots nnd coats were kept at work sending the water Into tbo nooks and crannies of tho Grecian capitals on the massive pillar's and Into tho recesses of the sculptured figures of tbo ornaments In the tympanum of the house and, senate gables. Even the heights of tho groat Iron dome were splnshed and flooded, and hardly nny part of the Im mense structure escaped a relentless bath. In addition to tho work of tbe engine .1 large force of capltol employos, with scrub bing brushes and plenty of soap, attacked tho worst placos which did hot yield to the washing given by the engine. A correspondent of tho Chicago Post fur nishes tho following Illustration of tho manner la which tho president disposes of offlceholdlng double-dealers: A federal of ficeholder from a western state whoso term 1 nearly up was at tbe White House tbs other day, Ho was nchlng to get a reap pointment and thought he could Insure I nnd nt tho samo tlmo please the preslden by tendering his resignation on the theorr that ho would thereby leavp him free to net. So tho fedeml Job-holder walked in to President Hoojevelt nnd nfter n few pre liminary remarks added Hint he had his resignation In his pocket. "I wnnt you to feel free to-net, Mr. I'resl dent," said he, feeling that 'ho wns doing a very clever thing, ' nnd whllo I hope to bv reappointed there la my resignation nt your fcrvlee." , If the caller thought the president would eagerly tell him to keep his resignation or say, "Well done, good and faithful servant; go buck and hold your offlco threo years longer," ho wns disappointed, for, quick as n flash. Mr. Roosevelt took the resignation from his unwilling hand and, turning to a stenographer, briskly said! "Notify Secretary Ongo that Mr. has resigned and there Is a acaucy In th so-and-so office." Before tho officeholder could collect hl scattered wits ho was In tho nnte-room vaguely wondering what had happenod to his clever scheme to "get solid" with the chief Job dispenser. Ho then broke nil speed records gutting to his congressman, whom ho told of the result of his visit and begged to go at otico and try to repair the damago ho had done. Tho congressman lost no tlmo In calling on tho president and, as tactfully ns possible, told him thnt hln constituent had not meant to resign nt all, but merely Intended to place his position at tho dis posal of tho now administration. "nidlculoui," tho president exclaimed It his rapid manner. "If ho didn't mean tt resign why did ho come here with hii resignation? There is no sense In suoh ac tions. It's ridiculous." Tho officeholder will probably be reap, pointed, as It Is not unllkoly President Roosevelt saw through his little feint nn mischievously decided to teach him a lei. son nnd discourage "grnndatand plays."
