VALLEY DRUG "centuries ago It was necessary to safeguard the accused" in criminal trials but now it has become more necessary to safeguard the state from ' the criminals who make the laws for the benefit of the" trusts. ' Inasmuch as President Roosevelt selected Herbert J. Hagerman for governor of New Mexico, it is fair to assume that the Pecos Valley man had as much Influence in securing a recommendation of the President that gambling be prohibited in the Terri tory as the President had In shaping the views of the new governor on the statehood question. President Roosevelt selected for governor a man from the first large city of New Mexico to prohibit gam bling a man whose father was large ly responsible for the general move ment against gambling in the Terri tory. The President now asks con gress to prohibit 'the licensing of gambling in all the territories and Roswell and Artesia are farther in the lead than ever. The 'President demands economy in public expenditures, the abolish ment of useless offices and the intro duction, of business methods into the various - departments of government. Just what New Mexico is promised under the new governor and joint statehood. Half the offices of New Mexico and Arizona will be abolish ed under jointure, and in the mean time Mr. Hagerman will introduce economy and business methods into the Territorial government. NOW 

YOU'RE SHOUTING. It is said we will soon have a joint statehood governor, but it is hoped he will exercise his opinion in the mat ter as well as other political con cerns, as Mr. Hagerman, not as Gov ernor Hagerman. Springer Stock man (Dem.) The Record feels safe in assurim the Stockman that Mr. Hagerman will do just that thing. He will not make any effort at coercing his ap pointees to do anything but work for the best interests of the whole Ter ritory. On matters In which there is honest difference of opinion he will allow them to reach their own conclusions. The President's Message titious damages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or payment of brokerage, is illegal. is worth while considering whether it would not be wise to confer on the Government the right of civil actiov against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate this would help stop what is really blackmail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demoralizing and are used as re bates. "The best possible regulation of rates would, of course, be that regu lation secured by an honest agree ment among the railroads themselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for instance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper or big railroad to dis criminate against or secure advan tages over some rival; - and such agreement would make the railroads themselves agents for enforcing the law. The power vested in the Gov ernment to put a stop to agreements to the detriment , of the public should in my judgment, be accompanied by power to permit, under specified con ditions and careful supervision, agree ments clearly in the interest of the public. But, in my judgment, the necessity for giving this further pow er is by no means as great as the neo essity for giving the Commission or administratice body the other pow ers I have enumerated above; and it may well be inadvisable to attempt to vest this particular power In the Commission or othter administrative body until It already possesses and is exercising what I regard as by far the most important of all the powers recommend as Indeed the vitally im portant power that"'- to fix a given maximum rate, which rate, after the lapse of a reasonable time, goes Into full effect. Subject to review by the courts. "All private-car lines, Industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate Com merce Commission or some similar body so far as rates," and agreements practically affecting rates, . are con cerned. The private-car owners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair and reasonable com pensation on their Investment, but neither private cars nor Industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as devices for securing pre ferential rates. A rebate in icing charges, or in mileage, or in a divi sion, of the rate ; for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a re bate in any other way. No lower rate should apply on goods imported than actually obtains on domestic goods from the American seaboard to des tination except in cases where water competition, is the controlling jnfl'i ence.. There' should be publicity of the accounts of common carriers; no common carrier engaged in interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the inspection of the Govern ment. Only in. this way can viola tions or evasions of the law be sure ly deteced. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be pro vided similar to that now conducted into the national banks by the bank examiners; a few first-class railroad accountants, if they had proper direc tion and proper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much in preventing willful violations of the law. It would not be necessary for them to examine into the ac counts of any railroad unless for good reasons they were directed to do so by the Interstate Commerce Commis sion. It is greatly to be desired that some way might be found by which an agreement as to transportation within a State intended to operate as a fraud upon the Federal interstate commerce laws should be brought un der the jurisdiction of the Federal authorities. At present it occurs that large shipments of interstate traffic are controlled by concessions on pure ly State business, which of course, amounts to an evasion of the law. The Commission should have power to enforce fair treatment by the great trunk lines of lateral and branch lines. "I urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditious action by the Interstate Commerce Commission in all these Tnatters, whether In regn lating rates for transporation or for storing or for handling property or commodities In. transit. The history of the cases litigated under the pre sent commerce act shows that Its ef ficiency has been to a ' great degree destroyed by the weapon of delay, al most the most formidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate the law. "Let me most earnestly say that these recommendations are not made in any spirit of hostility to the rail roads. On ethical grounds, on grounds, of right, such hostility would be intolerable; and on grounds of mere national self-interest we must remember that such hostility would tell against the welfare not merely of some few rich men, but of a multi tude of small investors, a multitude of railway employees, wage-workers; and most severely against the inter est of the public as a whole. I be lieve that on the whole our railroads have done well and not ill; but the railroad men who wish to do well should not be exposed to competition with those who have no such desire and the only way to secure this end is to give to some Government tri bunal the power to see that justice is done by the unwilling exactly as it is gladly done by the willing. More over, if some Government body is gen increased power the effect will be to furnish authoritative answer on behalf of the railroad whenever Ir rational clamor against it is raised, or whenever charges against it are disproved. I ask this legislation not only in the interest of the public but in the interest of the honest railroad man and honest shipper alike, for it is they who are chiefly jeoparded by the practices of their dishonest com petitors. This legislation should be enacted In a spirit as remote as pos sible from hysteria and rancor. Jf we of the American body politic are true to the traditions we have inher ited we shall always scorn any effort to make us hate any man because he is rich.-just as much as we. should scorn any effort to make us look down upon i or treat contemptuously any man. because he is poor. "We judge a man byvhis eonduct that is by ' his character- and not by his wealth or intellect. If he makes his fortune honestly, there is no Just cause of quarrel with him. Indeed we have nothing but the kindliest feelings of admiration for the suc cessful business man' 'who behaves decently, whether he has made his success by building or managing a railroad or by shipping goods over that railroad. ' The big railroad men and big shippers are simply Ameri cans, of ordinary type who have de veloped to an extraordinary degree certain great business qualities. They are - neither better nor - worse than their felllow-citlzens of : smaller means. They are merely more able in certain lines and therefore expos ed to certain peculiarly strong temp tations. These temptations have! not sprung, newly into being; the excep tionally . successful among mankind have always been exposed to them ; but they have grown amazingly in power as a result of the extraordina ry development of industrialism along new lines, and under these new con ditions, which 4 the lawmakers or oia could not forsee and therefore could not provide against, they -"have be come so serious and menacing as io demand entirely new remedies. It is in the interest of the best type of rail road .man and the best type of shipper no less than of. the public that tnere should be governmental supervision and regulation 'of these great busi ness operations, for the same reason that It Is In the interest of the corpor ation which wishes to treat Its em- ployees aright that there should be afl effective employers' liability act, or an effective system of factory laws to prevent the abuse of women and children. All such legislation frees the corporation that wishes to do well from being driven into doing ill In order to compete with it which pre fers to do 111. We desire to set up a moral standard. There can be no delu sion more fatal to the Nation than the delusion that the standard of, profits, of business prosperity is sufficient in judging any business or political ques tion-irpm rate legislation to municipal government. Business success, wheth er for the individual or for the Nation is a good thing only so far as it is accompanied by and develops a high standard of conduct honor, integri ty, civic courage. The kind of busi ness prosperity that blunts the stand ard of honor, that puts an inordinate value on mere wealth, that makes a man ruthless and conscienceless in trade and weak and cowardly in citi zenship, Is not a good thing at all, but ' a very bad thing for the Nation. This Government stands for man hood first and for business only as an adjunct of manhood. "The question of transportation lies at' the root of all industrial success, and the revolution in transportation which has taken place during the last half century has been the most impor tant factor in the growth of the new industrial conditions. Most emphat ically we do not wish to see the man of great talents refused the reward for his talents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized; but we do de sire to see the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong man shall be given no advan tage over the weak man. We wish to insure as fair treatment for the small town as for the big cities; for the small shipper as for the big ship oer. In the old days the highway of commerce, whether by water or by a road on land, was open to all; it be longed to the public and the traffic along it was free. .At present the rail way is this highway, and we must do our best to see that it is kept open to ill on equal terms. Unlike the old highway it Is a very difficult and com ilex thing to manage, and it isfar better that it should be managed by private individuals than by the Gov ernment. But it can only be so man aged on condition that justice is done the public. It is because, in my judg ment, public ownership of railroads is highly undesirable and would prob ably in this country entail far reach ing disaster, that I wish to see such supervision and regulation of them in the interest of the public as will make it evident that there is no need for public ownership. Safety Appliances. In my annual message to the Fifty-eighth Congress, at its third ses sion, I called attention to the neces sity for legislation requiring the use of block signals upon railroads en gaged in interstate commerce. The number of serious collisions upon un blocked roads that have occurred within the past year adds force to the recommendation then made. The Congress should provide, by appro Driate legislation, for the introduc tion of block signals upon all rail roads engaged in interstate com merce at the earliest practicable date as a measure of increased safety to the traveling public. Hours cf Labor of Railroad Employees. The excessive hours of labor to which railroad employees in train ser vice are in many cases subjected is also a matter which may well engage the serious attention of the Congress The strain, both mental and physical upon, those who are engaged in the movement and operation of railroad trains under modern conditions is per haps jrreater than that which exist in any other industry, and if there are any reasons for limiting by law the hours of labor in any employment they certainly aoply with peculiar force to the employment of those up on whose vigilance and alertness in the performance of their duties the safetv of all who travel by rail de pends. Labor. "The National Government has as a rule but little occasion to deal with the formidable group of problems connected more or less directly with what is known as the labor question for in the great majority of cases these problems must be dealt with by the State and municipal authorities and not by the National Government The National Government has con trol of the District of Columbia, how ever, and it should see to it that the City of "Washington is made model city in all respects, both as re gards parks, public playgrounds, pro- Der regulation of the system or nous ing so as to do away with the evils of allev tenements, a proper system or education, a proper system of dealing with tniancv and juvenile onenaers nroner handling of the charitable work of the District. Moreover, ther siimild be DroDer factory laws to pre vent all abuses in the employment oi women and children in the District. These will be useful chiefly as object lessons, but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of real nation al value. There has been demand for de priving courts of the power to issue iniimetions in labor disputes. Such special limitation of the equity pow ers of the courts would be most un wise. It is true that some judges have misused this power; but this does not justify a denial of the power any more than an improper excersise of the power to call a strike by a la bor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The remedy is to regulate the procedure by requir ine the judge to give due notice to the adverse parties before granting the writ, the hearing to be ex parte if the adverse party does not appear at the time and place ordered.. What is due notice must depend upon-the facts of the case; It should not be us ed as a pretext to permit violation of law, or the jeopardizing of life or pro perty. Of course, this would not author ize the issuing of a restraining order or injunction in any case in which it is not already authorized by existing law. : - - "In any great labor disturbance not only are employer and employee in terested, but also a third party the I Ml
