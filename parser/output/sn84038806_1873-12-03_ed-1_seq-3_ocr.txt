A remarkable Instance of rise in stocks is that of Best & Relcher. Two weeks ago they were quoted at 18, whilspyesterday they opened at Sl9. There are several parties In town in terested in their rise and fall. A runaway occurred yesterday on Alisp street, A span of horses ran fu riously uj) the street from the direction of the"river, with the front part of a vehicle attached.

The order is a most use ful one, and is rapidly increasing in number-.. The Champions are prepar ing for a series of lectures, to be given in this city by prominent and eloquent speakers, in a short time. The papers are constantly referring lo our hotels being overcrowded. This is not so and it keeps people away. Our hotels are all doing a good busi ness, but this idea about making up extra beds every night is btmkttm, nnd only hurls ihe various establishments. Fisher & Co. are placing In their es tablishment a beautiful show case made by Perry, Woodwortli & Co. The wood is Spanish 'mahogany and there are three compartments, the frames of whicli slide up. The divis ions are ornamented with neat rope mouldings and the whole is lined with black velvet. The interview between Bog* Tweed and hi* jailor as reported in the col- Minus of ii contemporary is affecting. Tlte reason the Herald did not get it in that shape is that tlie telegraph hoy was overpowered, anfl wept so freely nt tha graphic incident that his tottering steps would not permit of his reaching any of the other offices. There are thirty-two gentlemen at present occupying quarters in the City Jail. They express themselves as highly gratified with their treatment. Their daily meals arc prepared by a special cook, and for breakfast they enjoy cafe ou lait and pain rod; for <'.inner ftlet d* horn/ and pommet dc urr*: with substantial suppers. The beverage in most constant demand is supplied free from the city reservoir. Tlie Indianapolis Slate Library ac knowledges tlie receipt ofthe Weekly Los anoelks Herald from the Chamber ol Commerce.

Although there was no quorum last night and no business was transacted by the Chamber, a great deal of infor mal conversation of a very satisfactory nature took place. Governor Downey, Judge Wldney, S. hazard and Uie Secretary I. W. Lord, were present. The Chamber hopes to shortly have a building specially devoted to its use in which a mineraloglcal and geological cabinet and other attractions to visi tors would have a place.' A plan is in contemplation to lease such a hall provided arrangements can be made for its erection. The most desirable site would be directly in the rear of the Library Association Rooms, inas much as two large rooms could he erecetd at a cost of about $3,000, and the Interests ofthe two institutions are thoroughly identical.

[BY OUR PAPII) REPORTER.'] Two hours and a half is not bad time from Anaheim to Los Angeles, that's B fact, but but I diil it nevertheless, and sitting behind Guddy's team all the lime. 1 had such a lovely time that 1 hardly know where to begin. The drive is not worth a cent till you get beyond the 17-mile house and then there's a hill from the top of which is a view that cleans out all the poets have ever sung of Paradise or the Elys lan fields or any other fields. For twenty or thirty miles a valley stretch es out, smiling with perpetual ver dure, whilst innumerable streams flash in tlie sunlight, and tlie garden of Anaheim, with no forbidden trees in lt, lays below dotted with elegant resi dences and blooming with vineyards and fair orange groves. You know I don't write by the line, but how is that for elegant language. Un arriving at Anaheim the first gentleman I cal led on WM Capt. Knox, proprietor and editor of the Southern California)!. As a rule I don't like editors, at least I never met one yet that I could beat (yourself included) until I saw Knox, and in his favor I desire to make an exception. Know ing my habits you will not be sur prised *to learn that I next visited Fischer's hotel and recruited the inner man, for Anaheim air has a propensi ty to create vacuums' which can only be filled up by a sojourn with either Max Nebelung or FMscher. They are both genial fellows and keep a table that would cure consumption any time whilst it causes it. Next, being Sun day, 1 went to the Methodist Episcopnl church. This is a fine new build ing elegantly finished and fitted up, I would report the sermon but I know you would not ihsert It. The Odd Fellows have a new hall just finished at great expense, which will he opened on Wednesday, December 3d. The business houses are large, well built and commodious. The principal gen eral wholesale linns are those of Her mit n & George, M. Calisher & Co., Lnngenberger, Davis & Bro., Goodman & Co., Stein hart Bros., and others. Clarke it Austin have a fine bookstore and stationery house, they are also general news agents and dealers in musical instruments. Amongst the pleasant resting places nre Enterprise Hall and Billiard Rooms of P. Rich ards, the Exchange and others. The livery stables of Gaddy & Lewis and N. IL Mitchell are finely appointed, and I noticed a large millinery store owned by Mrs. F. M. Eldridge. Tlie largest of the wine growers is Benja min Dreyfus, who has three ware houses about 40x60 feet, each of which contains 00 casks of a capacity of 1,500 gallons and upwards. All the wine growers have beautiful residences, gardens, and of course, vineyards. In mv drive I noticed specially those of Mrs. F. Schneider, Kom & Co., W. Koenig, Theodore Reiser, R. Luedke Henry Kroeger, Mrs. T. E. Smith, H. I). Bodt, F. Hartung, Mrs. Eliza Quilp, Stewart & Hill, and Crowther Bros. It is impossible in a.short report to describe their places, and it would be but a repetition of a history of beauti ful gardens, orange groves,' vineyards, fruits and flowers. Messrs. Sacriste «k Elliot, as you know, have opened a branch depot of their woolen mill, and business is brisk and good generally. I had the pleasure of meeting A. J. Brown, con tractor and builder. Ho is a genial gentleman to whom the construction of all the bridges and approaches to Anaheim is due. One of the leading spirits of the town is friend Bob. White. He has a nursery as complete as ever I saw in my life, full of every thing that grows except children and these he has also at home. The nurseries of Doctor Harden are exquisite, as also are the orange proves and gardens of Mrs. Carillo. I was given a little branch with seventeen oranges on it, by Master Strobel, a young gentleman fourteen years of age, with the remark, "My father planted that tree, this year I shall have 3,000 oranges off it." This young gentle man and his brother were both left or phans on the death of Major Strobel. They nre very much beloved in Ana heim, and the elder boy has all the dignity and the ability to manage an estate, of many men of twice his age. Coming back, the country seemed more than ever like a vast estate, owned by some potentate, in a high state of cultivation. My visit was a most enjoyable one, but you need not record it in your paper unlesssyou feel inclined. 1 don't like editors anyhow. Passenger List.

Washington, Dec. L The House met at noon. The galle ries were crowded, as were most ofthe Heats In the hall. When Clerk Mc pherson reached Louisiana in calling the roll, he stated that there were but two unchallenged certificates from that State, and in the cases of an others there were conflicting sets of papers from Warmouth and Pinch back, and he had declined to enroll them. There was also a discrepancy in the papers from the Ninth Indiana District. From Arkansas but two of the four seats were represented. In the case of West Virginia there was a doubt as to the proper time of holding the election, and there were two sets of members elected ou different days, so none have been enrolled. The roll being called. 278 out of 390 enrolled answered. The House then proceeded to the election of a Speaker. Maynard nominated James G. Blame; Niblack nominated Fernando Wood; Holman nominated S. S. Cox; who said he was not a candidate. The vote resulted: Blame, 190; Wood, 77; Cox, 2; Climer, 1; Alexander H. Stephens, 1. Maynard and Wood conducted Blame to the chair, when he made a short address, thanking the House for the honor conferred. Davis, the senior member of the House administered the oath of office to the Speaker, who thereupon proceeded to swear in the members. About fifty Southern mem bers, among them Stephens, of Geor gia, who were unable to take the iron clad oath, took the modified oath. Delegates from Territories were called, and all except Cannon, of Utah, were sworn. Sargent introduced a resolution in structing the Committee on Com merce to inquire as to the expedi ency of the appointment by the Uni ted States of a Commission, part to be appointed by the State of Cali fornia, to examine and report upon the expediency of protecting the harbor of San Francisco by the construction of a sea wall, the United States to as sist in the work. During the session of the Cabinet to day the President formally ottered the position of Chief Justice* of the Su lliams. Court to Attorney-General Wi preme Colonel Bristow, of Kentucky, will be appointed Attorney-General. Nominations will be sent to the Sen ate tomorrow. Washington, Dec. 2. President Grant's message had been received. In it he speaks of our great national prosperity, and of the late financial crisis, which has brought low the fortunes of so many persons. He believes that political partizanshtp has almost ceased to exist, especially in the agricultural districts. He al ludes to the capture on the high seas of the Virginius, a vessel carrying our flag, which for the time threatened the most serious consequences, ami states that the difficulty is in course of peace ful settlement. Referring to our rela tions with the rest of the world, he states that we are on the most friendly terms with all the other nations. He speaks favorably of the showing made by the American exhibitors at Vien na. He is pleased to announce that the Emperor of China had recently re ceived diplomatic representatives of the Western Powers in person, and some progress has been made in the suppression of the Coolie trade. He thinks that further legislation on this subject may be necessary. He trans mits an application from the republic of San Domingo to the United States, requesting them to exercise a protec torate over that island, but makes no recommendation in that case. He in vites the earnest and special attention of Congress to the existing laws of tlie United States in regard to the rights of American citizens abroad. He is anx ious that Congress should point out the way in which American citizens may elect to adopt another nationality when residing in foreign countries, in case they should desire to renounce their allegiance to this government. The President advises forbearance on our part in the question of claims against Venezuela under the award of 1866. Philadelphia, Dec. 2. The steamer Juniata, from Havana, reports that the Virginius was still afloat when she left Havana on Tues day last. All vessels arriving at Ha vana had full cargoes of flour. Fifty thousand barrels had been ordered from New Orleans. 

[SECOND DISPATCH.] The President's Message 4 out In nod Cuban a Shir* and tha Pro Slavery Party Tha Navy to b«> Placed ou • War Footing- Amendment ol tho CouMtllution Economy ln Harbor Approprlaf louh and Build ing The Panle and Currency Legislation of Xatlouul Banka Protection or Shipping Interewte Etc., Etc. Washington, Dec. 2. Tne President refers at length to af faire in Cuba, and says the pro-slavery party there is arraying itself more and more against the home govern ment, and committing acts at vari ance with the principles of justice and right. He hopes the evil will be at last broken. He gives the history of the Virginius affair and denounces the acts of the Spanish authorities, and appeals to the judgment and patriot ism of the people to support his pol icy of placing the Navy on a war foot ing, and recomends two amendments to the Constitution to permit execu tive approval of so much of any measure passing Congress as he may deem proper, without approving all, and that Congress shall not legislate during the last twenty-four hours of the session, and further to provide that ln case of an extra session Congress shall confine itself to measures for which the session may have been called, or to such as the executive may subiplt to lt during the session. He recommends strict economy and says it may as well commence with appro priations for public buildings, in ap propriations tor river nnd harbor im provements in those localities where they nre of but little benefit to gen eral commerce, and in fortifications and claims for losses suffered during the rebellion. He says the proper cir culating medium is specie, nnd still says the panto has proved that the currency is based on the credit of the country and is the best ever devised. He dwells at length on the panic and its lessons, nnd directs attention to several remedies, which ho says can be secured by proper legislation, rela tive to National Banks. The matter of cheap transportation requires atten tion, and measures toward that end will receive his approval; also recom mends legislation for the protection of our shipping interests. Tlie suspension of J. H. Herrlek & Co., cotton and produce merchants, is announced. The members of the bar will meeton Thursday to protest against the action of Judge* Davis in relation to Tweed's counsel and Stokes'jurors. Tbe London Hour says It has trust worthy information that by the pri vately expressed wish of Pius IX, cardi nals have been in consultation and se lected Cardinal Pecci, the Archbishop of Perugia, for the next Pope. He was born in 1810, and became a cardinal in 1852; is a hard-working bishop, and is called an ultra-montane, but would no doubt live on terms of amity with the Italian Government. Even the free thinkersof Italy greatly respect Cardi nal Peccl. 

FOREIGN NEWS. London, Dec. 2. A special dispatch says that the inac tivity of the Spanish fleet at Cartagena Is owing to doubts of the fidelity of the crew of the iron-clad Saragosa. The story of a duel between General Manteuffel and Yon Goefer is said to be without foundation. PACIFIC COAST TELEGRAMS. Exclusively to the Herald. SAN FRANCISCO. The Wreck of the Villa de Havre—A llreatll'iil Scene Mayor Otis" In. augural. San Francisco, Dec. 2. Further particulars of the wreck of the steamer Ville de Havre have been received. The survivors attach no blame to the officers of the Lachinefor the catastrophe, but say they did all that was possible to prevent a sacrifice of life. TheLachine was very badly damaged. Her bowsprit was entirely gone, and a great hole was cut In her above the water line. The passengers of the Ville de Havre say that Capt. Surmount, during many days of fog, took every precaution and was con stantly on the deck ofthe steaner. No one explains how the collision occur red. A passenger says the men, wo men and children rushed on deck in their night clothing, and all was con fusion. The Lachine's bow had cut a fissure in the deck ofthe Ville de Ha vre 12 feet deep, and the iron plating of her side was crushed for a distance of 30 yards. Most of the passengers were too scared to save themselves. Many prayed, and many lay down In the calmness of utter despair. Some, hear ing the water pouring into the ship, never left their state rooms. Whole families thus went down together. Among the survivors was one lady, whose husband and four children had {wriahed in the sea; one young man ost his father, mother and sister, and another gentleman lost his sister, whom he was taking to France for her health. Mrs. Spofford, of Chicago, lost three children and a nurse. She sank with the vessel, but floated again and was picked up. The Ville de Havre was insured in London for S°o,ooo. The survivors reached Bristol in safety. The purser says the steamer was struck on the starboard side, and the mainmast and rigging were carried away. The long boat was not crushed on deck, but af ter being lowered the mizzenmast fell upon it and killed nearly all its occu pants. The mainmast* fell after the mizzen, toppling over on deck, killing ing many persons in a few moments, and the|steamer commenced to sink amid the great disorder and terror. Tlie scene was too dreadful to be de scribed. The air was rent with shrieks, but some were heard to say, calmly, "As we must die, let us die nobly!" I undressed myself with a companion, jumped overboard and swam toward the Lactone, then half a mile distant. As 1 left I heard the shipcreaking.and looking around saw her go down with one plunge. For a moment the shrieks were terrible, then all was silent. The captain remained on the Ville de Ha vre during the scene, and went down with the ship. He was picked up an hour afterward. George Treat, owner of Thad Ste vens, says he will permit that horse to enter for tbe 52.000 purse at Oak land next week. It is thought by many that Joe Daniels will also be en tered for this race. The inaugural of Mayor Otis was de livered at a late hour last night. He sketches a vigorous progressive policy for the city in every department of her government; thinks the police force should be increased and suggests that no more wooden pavements be put down, but that Belgium or granite pavement be used; recommends that the city front and Mission bay be opened to commerce by a system which shall give no monopoly of privileges to any particular company or organi zation of men. That facilities for all should be secured. Thinks the city ought to be divided into twenty Super visorial districts. In conclusion, he asked the new Board to be guided by one motive alone: Consideration for the public good. Mayor Alvord's valedictory was an able review of affairs during his term and contained many valuable sugges tions for the future. The messages will be printed. • Chief Whitney says he will not give up the office to D. Scannell till after tbe regular meeting of the Commis sioners to-day, and not then unless they so order. SECOND DISPATCH. Meetius; *>t *be Leg-lelature—Election ol Speaker and Clerk—Rebuke of Bornek The Fire Squabble—Two Boarda ard Two Chief. Meet at tbe Same Time and Place Coebrlll Suppressing" Houses of 111-Fame. Sax Francisco, Dec. 2. The California Legislature met to day at noou. The Assembly elected M. M. Estee Speaker and Lougbor ough for Clerk. Boruck received only eleven votes for the position and was rebuked by a special resolution for bis action yesterday in declining to recog nize the call for Ayes nnd Noes ou ad journment. The Senate failed to elect permanent officers and adjourned till to-morrow. Irwin and Evans for President pro tern: have polled a tie vote on eight ballots. Booth is gaining strength con stantly. Two Boards of Fire Commissioners met. Mr. Ford called the new Board to order, Torry the old. Both bodies met nt tho same time in the same room. The new Board adjourned till this evening—the old Board till the first Tuesday in January. Altogether fire department matters are in a fine muddle—two Boards and two chiefs to run the machine. The body of Harry Hudson of the ship Durham, who was drowned last night, has not been recovered. Chief of Police Cockrill has issued stringent orders for the suppression of bouses of ill fame in this city. The new Board of Fire Commission ers met in the house of Engine Com pany No. 4 and elected David Scannel Chief Engineer. This was the only important business transacted by them; after which the Board ad journed. Chief Whitney still main tains his authority. Weather cloudy, very cold. The new Board of Fire Commission ers met to-night at the new office. The officers of the old Board however de clined to surrender the rooms and keys or records, and the new Board proceeded to one of the engine houses. The result of their deliberations have not yet transpired. The matter will probably be settled by the courts. The condition of affairs at present existing would be very serious in case of fire, as the men in tlie Fire Department would not know which of the chiefs they ought to obey. Work on Wade's new opera house on Mission street near Third is progres sing rapidly. A large force of men are employed on the new mint trying to wash out and obliterate the dirty yellow stains in the sandstone. Improvement is ap parent and the question is whether it will be permanent. Jack Biderman died this afternoon at Sacramento, from the effects of the am putation of till leg. He had suffered much from inflammatory rheumatism, causing mortification ofthe kneejoint. He was well known in Sacramento, and had been employed as drayman for Leland Stanford.
