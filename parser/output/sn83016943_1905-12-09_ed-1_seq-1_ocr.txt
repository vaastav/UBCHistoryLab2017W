MATTERS IN NEED OF LEGISLA TION BROUGHT TO ATTEN TION OF CONGRESS. RECOMMENDATIONS MADE ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS Increased Power for Interstate Com merce Favored ai Cure for Rail road Rebate Evil Insurance and Labor Questions. Washington, Dec. 5 In 1,1 annual nwi-UK'- to congress, the president brings sev eral mutter lo the attention of lhe na tion's' lawmakers upon which, In lila tllnatfon, tests. utlon Is necessary. jlecom nienilaituns are made for new Iowa and advised in statute's ulrciiUy enacted, made necessary by changed conditions. The complete n.cssngc Is a document of almost se.cjou wonts. The only reference made to Ittiirr revision Is In the iaranniih devoted to national revenues, where he declared that unless our expenditures can be kept within the r' venues, our revenue lawn must be readjusted. What form this readjust ment should take, if it Is needed, he (te enies ii is us yet too early to any. Control of Corporations. The , resilient devntia considerable sace to the dlseussion of ttie ureal corimrauotis of the country, and particularly the rail roads, lie beiievcs tt.e time haa come when they should ho placed under federal control and recommends legislation lock ing to tiilM end The railroad rebate evil Is deplored, anil he advises ailiontm! Would nhoilKh it. He believes the present interstate commerce ,lnw are tnadciiuute urn! that tf the c-jir.mlaiv111 were endowed with more power it w!4 itt ureatlj .in solving I be vexed problem, flfthla connec tion l.c sava: 'i "It has been a misfortune that the na tional laws on thla subject have - hitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an afllimallve kind, and still more that they have In part soiiKlit' to prohibit what could not be (fficilvely prohibited, and have in part in ttieir prolilblllotiB con founded w hat should be allowed and what should not be ullc nrd. It Is generally use less to try to prohibit all restraint on com petition, whether this restraint be reason able or unreasonable, and where it is not useless it Is generally hurtful. Kventa have shown that it fs riot possible ade quately to secure the enforcement of any law of this kind by Incessant appeal to the courts. The department of Justice has for the last four years o'evoted more attention to the enforcement of the antitrust b Kisln tlon than to anything else. Much has been accomplished; particularly marked has been the moral effect of the prosecu tions; but It Is Increasingly evident that there will be a very Insufficient benotl itil result In I he w ay of economic change. The suet essftil prosecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops an oiher device to accomplish the same pur pose. What Is needed is not sweeping pro bit Ion of t-very nrrangemcnt, uood or bad, which may lend to restrict competition, but uch adequate supervision and regulatlurt as will prevent any restriction of competi tion from bctna: to the detriment of the publicas well as such supervision and reg ulation as will prevent other abuses in no way coajiPOMui with restriction of compe tition. Uf tlioae abuses, perhaps the chief, although by no means Iheonly one. Is over cnnltallzattnri aenerallv Itself the result of disbarest promotion because of the myriad evils it brings in its train; for such overcapitalization often means nn lnltatton that Invites business panic; it always con- peals the true relation of the protlt earned to the capital actually Invested, and 11 creates a burden of interest payments winch is a fertl.e cause of improper redue Hon in or limitation of wages; It damages ttie small Investor, discourages thrllt, and encourages gambling and speculation; while perhaps worst of all Is the trlcklnesa and dishomsty which It implies for harm to morals is worse than any possible harm to material interests, and the debauchery of politics and business by great dishonest corporations Is far worse limn any actual material evil they do to the public. Until t lie national government obtnlns, in some mtinner which the wisdom of the congress may suggest, proper control over the big corporations engaged in Interstate com mercethat Is, over the great majority of the tig corporations it will he Impossible to dcul adequately with tliese evils." Railroad Rate Regulation. He strongly protests against radical or hasty action in stopping iho rebate evil, anil thi n goes on to say: "I do not believe In the government interfering with private business more than is necessary. 1 do not believe in tho government undertaking liny work which can with propsftety be left in private hands. Hut. neither do-1 believe In the government lilnchltig frona oversee ing any work when It becomes evident that abuses are sure to obtain therern unless there Is governmental supervision. It Is hot my province to indicate1 tin' exact terms of the law which should be enacted; bllti call the attention of the congress to cer tain existing conditionE with which tt is de'slrable to ileal. In my Judgment the most Important provision wiilch such law should contain is that conferring upon some competent administrative body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it, whethera given rnte pre scribed by a railroad is reasonable and Just, and if It Is found to be univasonnble (Hid unjust, then after full Investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit ot rate beyond which it shall not be luwtul to go the maximum reasonable rate, ns it Is commonly called this decision to go Into efle-ct within a reasonable time and to ob tain from thence onward, subject to review by ttio courts. It sometltv.es happens at present, not that u rate Is too high but that a favored shlppi-r Is given too low a rate. In Eiich cases the commission would have the light to tlx this already established minimum rate as tho maximum; and It would need only one or two such decisions by the commission to cure railroad com panies of tho practlco of giving improper minimum rates. I call your attention to the fact that my proposal is not to give the commission power to lnltlnto or orig inate rates geni'mlly, but to regulate a rate already tlxed or originated by the roads, upen complaint and nfter Investigation. A heavy penally should be enacted from any corpt ration wiilch fails to respect an ordeir of the commission. 1 regard this power lo establish a maximum rate as being essen tial lo any sohi mo of real reform In the matte r of railway regulation. Thetirstne. cessity Is to secure it; and unless tt Is grunted to the commission there Is little use la touching the subject nt all. ."All private car lines.
