FEDERALLAWMAKERS Washington, Dec. 6. —The first reg ular session of the fifty-fifth congress assembled at noon. Speaker Reed pre siding in the house and Vice President Hobart in the senate. The preliminar ies were of the usual routine character. The president’s message was read in 'noth houses and a bill for postal sav ings banks was among the few measures presented. Washington, Dec. 7ln the sen ate Mr. Walthall (dem.. Miss.) pre sented the credentials of D. D. Money of Mississippi, to succeed the ate Senator George. Mr. Money was sworn in. An interesting contest for precedence in the consideration of the Lodge immigration bill and the pro posed legislation to confer author ity upon the president to act for the protection of the government’s inter est at the sale of the Kansas Pacific then occurred. Washington, Dec. 7. —The session of the -house witnessed a lively skirmish over the question of dis tributing the president's message to the various committees clothed with jurisdiction over the subjects dealt with. The conflict of authority came between the ways and means commit tee and the banking and currency committee. The battle raged all along the line. During the debate Mr. Grosvenor (rep., O.) fired the first gun against the civil service law, and this biought the friends and enemies of that measure into action. He heartily agreed with the president, “that there were places in the classified service which ought to be exempt.” “I am glad,” said Mr. Grosvenor, “to go that far with the president, even if I am compelled to part company with him when he says the civil service system las the official sanction of the people.” H;s remarks in denunciation of “life tenure in office” were met with up roarious applause. I Mr. Brosius, chairman of the com mittee of civil service, defended the law and thought any attempt to legis late upon the question must be re igarded as an indignity to the execu tive. Mr. Bailey (dem., Tex.) com-- mended Mr. Grosvenor’s utterances against the building up of an office holding class in this country. Mr. Johnson (rep., Ind.) in a ringing warn i mg declared that if the bill to emas culate the civil service law passed it would meet a presidential veto. Mr. Grosvenor he charged with being de relict to his duty as a republican. That party, he said, was unalterably pledged to support the law. No portion of the president’s message met with more hearty endorsement from him than that relating to civil service. More over he said it was a mistake to im agine that the sentiment of the coun try was opposed to it. The law is heartily approved by all except a few ’’degenerate politicians” who opposed it from selfish motives. During the progress of the debate Messrs. Walker and Johnson consulted with Dingley and a modification of the resolution of distribution was agreed upon. It gave the ways and means committee jurisdiction over all matters in the message relating to “revenue, bonded debt of the United States and to treaties of the United States affect ing revenue.” Representatives Griffin introduced | a bill to exempt from homestead entry I 120 acres of the land adjoining the Wisconsin rifle range at Camp Dauglas and turn it over to the state of Wis consin. The range now occupies 400 acres, but additional space is needed to provide for safety from stray balls. Washington, Dt?c. 8. —Mr. Allen (pop.. Neb.,) introduced in the senate a resolution declaring it to be the sense of the senate that congress should with all due convenient speed acknowledge by appropriate act the political independence of Cuba. He followed it with a speech declaring that i the commercial spirit of the United States was preventing action. The na tional republican convention had de cided in favor of the independence of Cuba, going further than simple recognition of belligerency. He thought that the president is under ob ligations to carry out the pledge which had been made to 73,000,000 people. The president, Mi 1 . Allen thought, had been lulled to sleep by the declaration of Spain that she would give Cuba semi-political existence. He expressed the belief that the president's neglect to take such action as would insurf, the political independence of Cuba was an exhibition of “rank hypocrisy” snd “flagrant neglect of public duty” which would be corrected by the all ruling power in its own good time. Senator Gallinger, introduced a bill prohibiting the granting of pensions to widows of soldiers whose marriage occurred subsequent to the passage of the bill under which they make their claim. Washington, Dec. 8. —I'he session of the house lasted only fifteen min ntes. Representative Barney (rep., Wis.) introduced two private pension ; bills to increase the pension of Col. D. ' Phinney to $45 a month, and to in ; crease that of Mertz B. Tschope to S4O. . Washington, Dec. 9.—ln the senate Mr. Gal linger (rep., N. H.) chairman ■of the committee on pensions, called i attention to the increasing demand ! for private pension legislation and re quested the senators to be careful in | the future to see that their bills for ■ private pensions were meritorious be , fore they were introduced. He thought ! that the practice of pensioning remar ! ried widows and several other similar classes of claimants ought to be stop- I ed. An attempt was made by Mr. Mc ! Bride (rep., Ore.) to secure an ap propriation for the relief of Klondike : miners, but the net result was a reso ; lotion calling on the secretary of war | for all the information that he had on ' that subject. A resolution by the Pacific railroad committee asking for ! information regarding the sale of the I Kansas-Pacific was adopted. This gave ! Messrs. Gear (rep., la.) and Thurston j (rep., Neb.) opportunity for short I speeches congratulating the country upon the settlement of the Pacific railroad question. Mr. Gear said that too much credit could not be given the \ present administration for the admir j able manner in which it had handled land disposed of the Pacific railroad matters. Mr. Thurston congratulated the country upon the result of the ad ministration's efforts regarding the Pacific rai]roads. He said that if the 1 plan proposed by Mr. Harris (dem., 1 Tenn.) had been adopted the United States would not have received any thing approximating the magnificent sum which has been paid for the main line of the Union Pacific. He said that he noticed in the president’s message i that the administration is committed i to a policy of purchasing the Kansas j Pacific branch unless a better bid is | offered. He did not believe in govern ment ownership of railroads and he I was of the opinion that the expert ! ment of such ownership, if it was to be j tried, might better be w r ith some other | than the Kansas-Pacific railroad. He I suggested to the Pacific railroad com i mittee that the authority asked for by I the president to bid in the read be I coupled with full power to re-sell it. i Mr. Hoar (rep.. Mass.) presented a 1 petition signed by 21,269 native Haw aiians, protesting against the annexa tion of Hawaii. Adjournment was j taken until Monday. Washington, Dec. 9. —The house entered upon a consideration of the pension appropriation bill and stirred up a debate that promises to continue for several days. Several southern democrats offered criticism on various classes of pensioners and Private John Allen (dem., Miss.), presented a series of amendments designed, as he said, Ito correct some of the most glaring ' evils. They prohibit granting pen j sions to widows whose applications | were not filed curing their widowhood I and the granting of pensions to wid- I ows whose applications were based on marriages contracted after the passage ci this act, and to permanently insane or idiotic minors who had reached heir majority. It was admitted on oth sides of the house during the discussion that the sl-10,000,000 carried by the bill for pensions would not ccver the expenditures but, as con gress would be in cession, Mr. Cannon 1 ep., III.) said it would be easy to make good any deficiency that might j occur. He gave a detailed statement of j prospective revenues and expendi tures and pleaded for economy. The debt for 1898 was put by him at $21,- 000,000 but Mr. Allen (dem.. Miss.) \ declared it would be $72,000,000. A 1 long debate on pensions ensued. 

HERE AND THERE. A most ingenious system is em ployed by which the director of the Suez canal can tell at a glance the exact position of all vessels passing ihiough A is placed in the once at Port Said, and the whole canal i® worked from headquarters by means 01 the telegraph, the position of each ship being marked by a figure on the model. It is thus made easy to ar range for vessels passing each other. It is now said that women’s hair is becoming more beautiful in color every year, and is also growing thick er and longer. This is said -to be due to the light bonnets that women wear. Certain it is that air and sunshine im prove the color and texture of the hair. Sun bleaches the hair, and Ve netian beauties always dried their ruddy locks in the sun, thereby getting that tint so much admired called Venetian red. Of course sunshine v.'ili not bleach dark hair, but it gives a deeper color to all kinds of tresses, an.l will brighten dull brown hair. A railway to India, from Alexand to Agra and Bombay, is proposed by C. E. D. Black, in a paper read the English Society of Arts. The line we -Id be 2.400 miles long, from Port Said to Kurrachee, and would crass upper Arabia to Basra, at the head of the P rsian gulf, and skirt the north shore of the gulf and the Arabian Sea to Kurrachee, on the border of India. Mr. Black advocates the route for po litical purposes mainly, though he thinks the revenue would be sufficient to pay a fair interest on its cost of $75,000,000. M’KINLEY’S FIRST SWEETHEART. Lydia Wadsfonh McMoug Tells tbe Romantic Story of Her Early Love. “Yes, I suppose it is true that I was Mr. McKinley’s first sweetheart. At any rate, he was my first lover, and we would have been married but for my parents’ opposition.” The speaker was Mrs. Lydia Mc- Mcug, of Big Rapids, Mich., who had at last consented to tell the story of the early romantic love passage be tween herself and the man who is now president of the United States. It has long been known in its outline—the story of the thwarted affection of young McKinley and the beautiful Lydia Wadsworth, away back in their golden y nth in Ohio, when no one dreamed that the abmitious but penni less young man, with the dreamer s forehead, but the fine eye of resolution, would become a great statesman and executive. If people had guessed it John and Lydia Wadsworth might not have refused the young man the hand of their doughter. They lived in Po land, 0., the Wadsworths, father, mother and four children. “Little Lydia,” as they called her, was then sixteen years of age and very pretty. She had plenty of admirers, for court ship began early in the middle west in those days, and a girl of sixteen was expected to “keep company” with some young fellow. Of them all she favored but one, a manly, energetic lad who wooed like a Napoleon and won, but met his Waterloo at the hands of the old people. For McKinley was poor. He had his way to make in the world, and to the shrewd eye of John Wadsworth he did not appear like a man calculated to make money. In this judgment Wads worth was probably correct, but there are other ways of succeeding than by becoming rich. So Wadsworth for bade “Little Lydia” to meet McKinley. With the usual result. Clandestine meetings followed, and whispers of a possible elopement were wafted to the old folks’ ears. They resolved upon stern measures. There was in Poland a young man named McMoug, who had persistently wooed the fair Lydia. He was a few years older than McKinley and bade fair to be a prosperous man. His suit the parents favored. One day they told Lydia that she must marry Mc- Moug. There was a stormy scene. The girl vowed she would have the man of her choice or none, but in the end she yielded. She promised, and from that moment her parents knew' their case was won. She w'as too honorable to go philandering with any young man other than the one to whom she -was pledged, and McKinley w r as too proud to tempt her further. So she married McMoug, who has been to her all that her parents an ticipated. She resolved to forget her lover. She returned or burned a.ll the foolish little tokens that could remind her of his bright face. She turned her eyes resolutely to the future. Today she is living in Big Rapids with her husband and two pretty daughters, who faintly suggest her own beauty at their age. Their home is cozy and comfortable, and they have the respect o. the community and a substantial part in its social life. 

‘RASTUS SMITH’S OCCUPATION. Rastus Smith was a character in the little town in which he lived. Like other members of his race, he was fond of using big words, whether they were just the thing or not. Word had got about that Rastus was to be married, and one evening soon aftei he strolled into the store of the town and asked for a pair of suspen ders. While showing the various styles, the clerk said: “Well, Rastus, I hear you’re going to be married.” “Dat’s my occupation.” came Rastus’ response as he picked out a pair of red suspenders and paid his quarter.
