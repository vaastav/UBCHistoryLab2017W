I am no' engaged in making Cabinets at tin present time, tho newspapers nol withstanding.'' We think the number of Cabinet officers should be increased from seven to twelve, to correspond with the growth of our country. There should be a Minister of Slate, "War, Navy Finance, Post-office, Interior, Justice.

NEED OF THE POSTAL SERVICE, Tt discloses the stratifying fact that die loss of revenue from the reduction ii the rate of letter postage as recom uiMided in inv message of December, 18S2, and ell'ected by the act ol March . 1883. has been much less than was generally anticipated. My recom mendation ot this reduction was based upon the belief that tho actual falling oil ill receipts irom leuer pos ta'rofor the year immediately sue ceeding change of rate would be if:, .MUMK). It has proved to he only $2, 275.000. This is a trustworthy indi cation that tho revenue will soon he restored to former volume by natural increases of sealed correspondence. I ionlidently repeat therefore, the re commendation of my lastannual mcj- ;age, that SINGLE KATE TOSTAGE ITON PltOP LET TERS be reduced toono cent wherever pay ment of two cents is now required by law. The double rate is only exacted itoffices whore tho carrier system Is in operation, and it appears that at these utliccs the increase in tax upon local letters defrays cost not only ot its own collection and delivery, but of tho collection and delivery of all other mail matter; this is aiv inequal ity that ought no longer to exist. I approve the recommendation ol the Postmaster General that the unit of weight in the rating ol lirsl-class matter should be one ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it now is. In view of the statistics furnished by the department, it may well be doubted whether the charge would result in any loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the commerce of the public is bevond dispute, the iree delivery system has been lately ap plied to live cities, and the total num ber ot otuces in which it is now in operation is one hundred and fifty nine. Experience shows that its adoption under proper conditions is equally an accommodation to the public anil an advantage to the postal service. It is more than self-sustain ing, and, for tho reason urged by the Postmaster General, may, properly bo extended. It is the opinion of that officer that it is proper to provide means whereby exceptional dispatch in dealing with letters in free-deliv ery offices mav bo' secured by pay ment of extraordinary postage. This scheme might ho made effective by the employment of a special stamp, whose cost should be commensurate with the expense of tho extra service. In some of tho large cities, private miles from tho Sioux reservation. Both tho measures are worthy of approval. 1 concur with mm also in advising the repeal of the Pre-emption law; the enactment of statutes resolving tho present legal complications touch ing lapsed grants to railroad compan ies and tho tunding of the debt of the several Pacitic railroads under such guaranty as shall effectually insure its ultimate payment. 

UTAH COMMISSION. Tho reports of the Utah Commis sion will bo read with much in terest. It discloses the results of the recent legisl ituro looking to tho pie- vcntiou and punishment ol polygamy in that Territory. I still believe that if that aboiunablo practice can be suppressed by law it can only bo by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the Constitu tion. I again recommend, therefore, that Congn si assume absolute politi cal control ol the Territory - of Utah and provide for the appointment of a commission with su-,h government powers as in its judgment may just ly and wisely be put into their hauds. Our foreign trade. THE l'ROKLKM FULLY CONSIDERED, AND 8UUOKSTIONS OFFERED. Ill the course of this communica tion reference has more than once been made to tho policy of this Gov ernment as regards tho extentiou of our foreign trade. It seems proper fo declare the general principles that should, in my opinion, underlie our .National ellorls in this direction. The main conditions of tho problem may be thus stated : We are u people eugagol in mechanical ) U.'suiis and Icrtile invention. Wo cover a vast extent ot territory rich in agn. ill- l u ral products and in nearly all the iiw materials necessary for success ful manufacture. We have a system of productive establishment more than sufficient (o supply our own de mands. The wages of labor are no where so great. Tho scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to secure their personal comfort and the development of those higher mor als and intellectual qualities that go to the makiii!! of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is yielding a revenuo which is in excess j ol the present needs of tho Govern ment. These are the elements irom which it is sought to devise a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the condition of tho work ingmen, our merchant mariiio shall be raised Irom its enfeebled condi tion, and new markets provided for the tale beyond our borders of the manifold fruits of our industrial en terprises. The problem is complex, and can not be solved by u single measure of reform. Tho countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States, tho natural market of supply and dcjiiiand it is from them that we should obtain what we do not pio ducu in efficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields, our mills and our workshops should flow under conditions that will equalize or cover them in con. parisou with foreign competition. Four paths of policy teem to point to this end. First A series of reciprocal com mercial treaties with the countries of America which shall foster between us and them mi unhampered move ment ot trade. 1 lie conditions ot these treaties should be free, admis sion of such merchandise as this country does not produce in return for tho admission tree, or under a favored scheme of dudes, of our own products, tho bench U ot such cx- liaujje to apply on these goods car ricd under the flag ot the parties to the contract; the removal on both sides from vessels to be so privileged ol all tou n Mite dues and natural mi ports, so that their vessels may ply unhindered between our ports, and those of other contracting parties, though without infringing ,on the reserved home coasting trade; the re inoval or reductiou of bunions on the exported products of those coun tries coming within the beuehls of the treaties, and the avertauce ol technical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries, is at present hampered Second 1 he establishment ot the Consular service id' the United States on a salaried fooling, permitting the relinquishment of consular fees, not only as respects vessels under the National flag, but also as respects vessels of the treaty Nations carrying goods eutitled to the benefits of the treaties. , Third The enactment of measures lo favor the construction and main tenance of a steam carrying marine under the flag of the United Stales,

They said that for a time there was a prevalence of flux in somo remote countries, and there was an Increase in tho mortality over other years when the same diseaso had visited them, but that there was no plague and no great fright among tlio peoplo and none were fleeing from their homes on that account. They said that deaths among the mounlain peo plo are ordinarily so in frequent that the dying of one man from any acute disease is always heralded throughout the country, and the dying of two or three in ono neighborhood is very easily exaggerated by rumor into a much greater number. Neither of the gentlemen who spoke of the mat ter uttatched any consequence to the diseaso itself, but they all thought that the reports of it were highly col to outstrip the Government mail-carriers by affording, for the prompt transmission ot letters, better facili ties than havo hitherto been at the command of tho l'ostoflicc. Tt has alwavs been the policy of the Govern ment to discharge such enterprises, and in no better mode can that policy be maintained than in supplying the public with the most ellicieut mail service that, with due regard to its own best interests, can bo furnished lor Its accommodation. The Attar ncy General renews the rccommenda tion contained in his roport of last year touching tho fees of witnesses and jurors. J Io favors radical changes in tho Fee Bill, tho adoption of a system by which attorneys and marshals of the United States should bo compensated solely by salaries, and the erection by the Government ot a penitentiary lor tho confinement of offenders against its laws of the va rious governmental concerns in charge of the Interior Department. The reports of its Secretary present an interesting summary. Among the topics deserving particular atten tiou I refer you to his observation respecting our Indian all'airs, the pre emption acts, the lailure ot railroad companies to take title to lands granted by tho Government, and the operations of the Pension Ofllce, the l'alent Office, Census Bureau and the Bureau of Education. Allusion has been made already to the circumstance that both as be tween different Indian tribo-j and as between different Indians and tlio whites the past year has been ONE OF UNHItOKE.V t'KACE.

As many of the countries furnish no bullion lo the common stock, the surplus of our mines and mints might thus be utilized and a step takcu toward the general rcm ouctization of silver. . ' To the accomplishment of the ends, so far as they can be attained by sep arate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed, and the tavor with which this enlarged policy lias thus far been received warrants the belief that its operations will ere long em brace all, or nearly all, the countries of this hemisphere it is by no means desirable, however, that the policy under consideration should be appli ed to theso countries alone. The heal Lli ful enlargement of our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa should besought by reducing the tariff bur den on such of their wares as neither wo or the other American Slates are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a better market for our supply of food, of raw materials and of the manufactures in which we excel. It seems to me that manv of the cnibarassing elements in the great National conflict between production and free trade may thus be turned to good account; that the revenue may be reduced so as to no longer overtax the people ; that pro tective duties may be retained with out becoming burdensome; that our shipping interests may be judicious ly encouraged ; the currency fixed on a firm basis, and above ail such an unity of interest of the establishment among the States of the American system as will be of great and ever increasing advantage to them all.
