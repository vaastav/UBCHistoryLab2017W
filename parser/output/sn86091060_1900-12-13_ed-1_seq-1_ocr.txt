John Russell, a veteran mining man, has returned from a short trip to the Hailey section, where he investigated the gold belt as thoroughly as time would permit. He says he has seen no such country as that since leaving Col orado, and indeed does not now feel disposed to put that state ahead of Idaho. The Tip Top mine, Mr. Russell says, is vvorkiugeight feetof chaleopy ritic ore which gives returns of 8100 per ton gold and 30 per cent, copper— one of the prettiest sights and largest ore bodies in the country. "A few days ago," said Mr. Russell, "they raade a strike in the Golden Star mine, half a mile west of the Tip Top, of th *ame kind of ore aud the same values. It is on the 300-level, while the Tip Top is working on the 400. The ore in the Star is five feet in width—solid. An old shaft had been sunk on this proper ty, but the owners tapped the ledge in a barren spot and drifted 100 feet each way on the vein without finding ore, when they bonded it for $50,000. The new owners continued these drifts and in a short distance found the ore, as stated, in both cads of the drift." The 10-stamp mill on the North Star raine, located 12 miles from Boise, started up for the first time on the last day of November, and is now rnnning smoothly, and by the looks of the plate» and concentrators the plant is running on the finest kind of ore.

"Good horses are scarce in Europ« and Asia," he said, "and even theu tin few that can be procured in tlios# countries cannot be relied upon to d.* the work required as well as the Amer iean bred anitnal."

ISTHMIAN CANAL ROUTE. a the will lias is ber will cal ther Mr. that it sure NICARAGUAN ROUTE RECOM MENDED. • Canal Commission Report«—Completion ot Cennl Will Require Expenditure of 8200,000,000. The report of the isthmian canal commission which was submitted by the president to congress Tuesday giver as the unanimous conclusion of that body that "the most practicable and feasible route for an isthmian canal under the control, management and ownership of the United States is that known as the Nicaraguan route." The commission estimates the cost of this route at $200,540,000. This esti mate is much In excess of any hereto fore made and is due to increased di mensions and other features not here tofore considered. The commission also estimates the cost of a canal by the Panama route at 8142,342,379, ac cording to one route, or $156,378,258, according to another route. As between the Nicaragua and Pan ama routes the commission sums up a number of advantages favorable to the former. It states also that under the concessions given by the government of Columbia to the Panama Canal com pany that government is not free to grant the necessary rights to the United States, except upon conditions made by the company. After going over the several routes, the commission considered the dimen sions of the canal to be built. Having in mind the increasing size of ocean going vessels, it was determined to fix upon a depth of thirty-five feet at mean low water, and a bottom width of 15C feet, with some increase of dimensions at certain points. These dimensions are larger than those proposed for any previous canal scheme. While they niay seem excessive today, the com mission says that the canal is not likely to be opened within ten years, during which time the Increase in maritime dimensions is likely to continue. A width of 150 feet will allow all but the very largest ships to pass each other in the canal, while the locks are of a dimension to permit even the largest ships afloat to be maneuvered. The size of locks is 740 feet in length, 84 feet iu width, iu the clear, with a depth of 35 feet. A a the on If a on for lias the Ilis the but

CHINA WINNING? A London I*aprr Tlllnk. So, Owing to th« Attitude of United State, and HumIm. The London Spectator in a striking article dealing with the Chinese crisis expresses the opinion that the most re cent occurrences at Pekin foreshadow a Chinese victory over the allies. "The quarrel has been brought to the test of force," it says, "and force on the civilized side has proved insuffi cient. This result is mainly due to tho attitude of Russia and United States. If China escapes with the payment of a small indemnity and many promises I on paper, as seems not unlikely, since Germany and Great Britain may not bo willing to incur the expenditure and i risk involved in persisting in their de< mauds, it will be a victory for China for nothing has occurred that will con vince the Chinese that their mighty Empress has been defeated or that Eu rope ean avenge any future massacres.

Mr. Towne said that liis time of ser vice would, of course, be short, but he might have to vote on some important measures, lie considered the ship sub tidy bill a bad one and is against it.

He does not expect to partici pate in debate at all during bis short term. Need, of Alaska. Gov. Brady of Alaska has arrived in Ytashington. Discussing the needs of Alaska, he said: "Alaska needs laws which will en able residents to acquire title to their homes and lands. In order to do this survey work must be extended. "I advocate the best bestowal of citi zenship upon the natives. They are good people. The Eskimos of Alaska have been unfairly treated. "Dutch Harbor should be fortified. It is the strategical point of southern Alaska. I cannot urge too strongly the need of an Alaska cable to some point on Puget Sound.*'
