[DEFERRED PORTIONS.] THE VIENNA EXPOSITION. made an ar'orooriatiou to defray the expense of commissioners on the part of the United States to the Interna ! tional .-statistical Congres3 at St. Peter-bur..-, the persons appointed in that character" proceeded to their destination, and attended the sessions of the conre--: their report shall in due season' be laid before you. This roiiere meet at intervals ot awut t i-oir, nnii i.na heM if coaiinnB in several of the countries of Kurope. I submit to vour consideration the propriety of extending an invitation to the Coneress to liold its next meet- ing in the United States.

Preparation am raak- lag for the international exposition to be Held at Vienna on assiis ofverv rreat magnitude. The tendency o"f these erpositior. sis ia the direction of advanced civilization and of the ele-. iv.ition of industry, of labor, and of j the increase of human happiness as well as of greater intercourse and good! will rxtween nations. As this expo-i sition Ls to be held in eastern Europe, it is oelieveu toat American manu facturers and inventors will be ready to avail themselves of the oportunity for the presentation of their produc i tious, if encouraged by proper aid and protection. At the last session of Congress authority was given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent this government at the ex- l lie authority tnus uuaiiiuu. x uuiiijr ii.u3 has been exercised, but iu the absence 1 of any appropriation, there is danger j that the important benefits which the occasion oilers will, in a large degree, be lost to the citizens of the United States. I commend the subject strong ly to vour consideration, and recom mend that an adequate appropriation i be ready for the purpose. To further aid the American exhib itors at the Vienna exposition, I would recommend, in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Sec retary of the Xavy be authorized to lit up two naval vessels to trans- port between our Atlantic cities and irieste, or tue most convenient port, to Vienna and back their articles for exhibition. THE 

POLICY WITH MEXICO. , . Since your -last session the 1 rcai- dent of the Mexican republic, distin- guished by his high character and his services to the country has died. His temporary successor has been elec- ted with great unanimity by the mo- pie, a proof of confidence on their paJ!4ni19tPftrl0ti1SlnIn honflrT wlcb:utl3hleVAd w U," ed by the result of his administration. It is particularly desirable .that noth- ing should be left undone by the gov- ernment of either republic to sength- en Uieir relations as neighbors and friends. It is much to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border between our territory andtuat of Mexico, and that com- plaints of wrong to American citizens in various paru of the country are made. The revolutionary condition in which the neighboring republic has so long been involved, has in some degree contributed to this disturb- auce. It s to be hoped that with a more settled rule of order through the republic which may be expected from the present government, the acts, of which just complaint is made, will cease. The proceedings of the commission u??? Jte Wn?mM? &?wJS of the 4th of July, lbCS, on the subject of claims have unfortunately been checked by an obstacle, for theremov- ai of which, measures have been tak- ea cy ue ia gu UUieu , u is believed, will prove occessfuL The commissioners appointed pursu- ant to the joint resolutions of Con- gress of the . th of May last to inquire into the depredations on the Texan frontiers have diligently made inves- tigationsin that quarter. Their re- norton the subiept will be commu- nlcated to you. Their researches were necessarily incomplete, partly account of the limited anoroDria- tion muli hv t'onfress. IMerlco. on the pair of that government, has ap- pointed a similar commission to in- vestis-ate these outrages. It is an- nouueed ofilciallv. but the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the co-operation of all parties concerned i invited to sponre that end I there- fore recommend that a special appro- priation be made at tl.e earliest day practicable to enable t ie commission- ers on the part of the United States tn r,.ti,rn .,, thoir l.ibfir withoul delav. 

SALE OF PUBLIC LANDS. During the last fiscal year there were disposed of out ol the puunc lands ll,S0l,!'7. acres, a quantity sreater ly 1.0iiO"iO acres than was disposed of the previous year. Of! this amount 1,070.30 acres were s!d for cash, :wi,4'iti acres located with military warrants, 4,071 ,.'32 actcs ta-: ken for homesteads C!3,C1.1 acr s loca- j ted with college scrip, .5o4,8&7 acres; ; tiuilll'u iu lain vi.ki.-s n",."! m I Granted tr. wairon roads. 714.2V, acres iveu to states as swamp land, and 1 5.400 acres located by Indian scrip. The cash receipts from all sources in the land ollice amounted to S:i,218, 100. During the same period 22,010, 00S acres of tho public lauds were sur- i-oip, u'li it'll milled to thn nnantitv "Ia -.c- mi' 7S0 acres, leaving 1,257,033,028 acres of the public land yet uusurveyed. The reports from the subordinates of tbe Land utnce contain interesting information in regard to their respec tive districts. They uniformly men tion the fruitfulness of the soil during the past season, and the increased yield of all kinds of produce evince, in those states and territories where mining is the principal business, the agricultural product to have exceeded the local demand, and liberal ship ments have been made to distaut points. PATENTS. During the year ending September 30, 1S72, there were issued from the patent office 13,020 patents, 33 ex tensions, and 656 certificates and reg isters of trade marks. During the same time U.5S7 applications for pat ents, including reissues and designs have been received, and 3,100 caveats filed. The fees received during the same period amounted to 50,095,9S6, and the total expenditures to $62,355, 390, making the net receipts oyer the expenditures $7,740,056. Since 1836, two hundred thousand applications for patents have been filled, and about 134,000 patents issued, the offices be ing conducted under the same laws and general organization as were adopted-at their original inaugura tion, when only from one hundred to five hundred applications were mada per annum." The Commissioner shows th office hns outgrown the j original plan, and that a new organi ' ration has become necessary. This ! subject was presented to Congress in a special communication in February lat, which met my approv i al and the approval of the Secre tary of the Interior, and thesug ' gestions contained in said communi cation were embraced in a bill that was reported to the Hone by the Committee on Patents at the last ses ! sion. The subject of the reorganlza- tion of the Patent office, as contem-1 plated by the bill referred to, is one of such importance to the industial in- tercsts of the country that I commend it to the attention of Congress. The commissioner also treats the subject of the separation or the latent oruce from tbe Department of the Interior. ln'3 suH)eci is aiso emoraceu in tue hi 11 hpretnffire referrpil to. I n pom- bill heretofore referred to. The com- rnLsioner complains of the want of ; room for the model pallery and for , the working force and necessary files of the office. It is impossible to trans-' at the business of the office nroperlv without more room in which to ar-! range files and drawings that must be be consulted hourly in the trars-1 action of husiness.

That re public is understood to be now almost if not quite tranquilized. It is hoped therefore, that it will lose no time in providing for tbe unpaid balances of its debt to the United States, which haviug originated in injuries to its citizens by Venzuclan authorities and having been acknowledged, pursuant to a treaty in the most solemn iorm known among naf long, it would seem I ! wosiguched. Itis hope ', however, that to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin and contracted in a different manner. This subject is aeaia recommended to the attention of Constres3 for such action as niay be deemed proper. ! Our treaty relations with Japaa re- main unchanged.

The policy which was adopted at the beginning of the administration with regard to the managementof the Indians has been as successful as its most ardent friends anticipated. Within so short a time it has reduced the expense of their management, de creased their forages on the white set tlements, tended to give the largest opportunity to the extension of the great railways through the Dublic do- main, and the pushing of settlements iuuj more remote uiairicis 01 me country, and art. the same time lm- prove the condition of the Indians.

CENSUS. The ninth census Ls about complet- ed. IU completion is a subject of con- giatulation, inasmuch as the use to be i made of the statistics therein con on tained depends very greatly on the promptitude of publication. The Secretary of the Interior recommends that a census be taken in 1S75, which recommendation should receive the ready attention of Congress. The in- terval at present established between the federal census is so long that the information obtained at the decennial periods as to the material condition, wants, and resources of the nation is of littlo practical value aftor the eipl- ration or the nrst nan ot that period, It would probably obviate the coneti. tutional provision regarding the de- t nanninl CAnnlld. if A. ppntn tnlrpn in ls should he tiivested of all political character and no reapportionment of i Congressional iepreaentation be made I under it. Such a census, coming as I would in the last year of the hrst century of our national existence Would furnish a noble monument of j the progress of the United States dur

Li business PENSIONS. Tho amount paid for pensions in the last fiscal year was $30,169,310, an amount larger by S3,708,4C4 than was paid during the preceding year. Of this amount $2,313,409 was paid under the act of Congress of February 17, 1S71, to survivors of the war of 1S12. The annual increase of pen sions by the legislation or ingress has more than kept pace with the natural yearly losses from the rolls. The act of Congress of June 8, 1872, has added an estimated amount of 5750,000 per annum to the rolls, with out increasing the number of pension ers. We can not, therefore, look for any substantial decrease in the ex penditures of this department for some time to come, or so long as Con gress continues to so change the rates of pension. The whole number of soldiers enlisted ln the war of the rebellion was 2,628,523. The total number of claims lor invalid pensions is 176,000, being but six per cent, of the whole number of enlisted men. The total number of claims at the beginning of the year was 91,669 ; the number received during the year was 26,574; the number disposed of was 33,173, making a net gain of 1,264. The number of claims now on file are 79,085. On the 30tb, of June, 1872, there were on the rolls 95,400 invalid military pensioners; 113,518 widows, orphans and dependent relatives, making an aggregate of 203,923 army pensioners. At the same time there were on the rolls the names of 1,449 ; navy pensioners, ana i,iM widows, orphans and dependent relatives, making the whole number of na val pensioners 3,179. There have been received since the passage of the act to provide pensions for the survivors of the war of 1S12, 36,551 prior to June 30, 1&72. Of these there were allowed during the last fiscal year 20,120 claims: 4.S15 were rejected during I the year, leaving 11,580 claims pend- inir t thnt date. The number of pen j s!orj, 0f an classes granted during , tne fiscal year was 23.83S ; during j that period there were dropped from j tne rolls for various causes 9,lo4 names, leaving a grand total of 232,- xt pensioners on the roils on the 30th 0fjune , 1&72. It is thought that the I claims for pensions on account of the wnr nf isiff wiii oil be disposed of bv the lt of May 171. It ia estimated tnat 5,4,000 will be required for the pension service during the next fo-i year, ' " TERRITORIAL AFFAIRS. Affairs in the territories are scner- ally, satisfactory.

Except so far as the quiet of the citizen may be disturbed by real or imairinarv daneer of Indian hostili- ties, it has seemed to be the policy of the Legislature of L tah to evade all responsibility to the government of the I nited States, and even to hold a position ia hostility to it. I recom It mend a careful revision of tbe present laws of the Territory by Congress, and the enactment of such a law, as the One nrODOSea in COOKTesS Ul Its JdSl session, for instance, or sometning similar to it, as will secure peace, the equality of all citizens before the law, and the ultimate extinguishment of polygamy. tsince the establishment of a terri torial government for the District of Columbia, the improvement of tbe condition of the city of Washington and surroundiDtm. and the increased prosperity of the citizens, art orsjerva- !ble to the most casnal visitor. The nation, being a large owner of proper-1 ty ia this city, should bear with the citizens of the District a just share of, the expense of these improvements, I recommend, therefore, an appropria- tion to reimburse the citizens for: the work done bv them alonir and in front of public grounds during the past year, and liberal approprations in order that tne improvement ana em being bellishment cf the public bnildings : and grounds mav keep pace with the : . . , i . . : : i I authorities.

REPUBLIC NEWS. Thanksgiving Day was publicly ob served with religious exercises at the Methodist Episcopal Church. Six clergymen, representing five denom inations were upon the platform and a good audience was in attendance. Rev. J. K. Eckman, of the Lutheran Church presided. Rev. T. Thompson made the opening prayer. Prof. J. F. Richard, Disciple, delivered the open ing address taking as his theme "For What should We be Thankful?" Rev. H. Hall, Baptist, followed with "Our National Sins and Needed Reforms." Rev. A. H. L. Bateman, of the Meth odist Church, then spoke upon "The Manner of Thanksgiving to God." Rev. H. Bromley, Universalist, made the closing prayer. Rev. Thompson responded to a call and made a few remarks. The students of the Nor mal School furnished excellent music.
