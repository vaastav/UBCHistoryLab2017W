Topeka's first war Christmas since "the days of '61" will f" a"' American one, it was asserted today by firms handling holiday poods. Presents given mother, father brother and "just friends will all be made in America. The same tokens will be placed on Christmas trees Brown in the forests of northern states or Canada. There'll be no im ported toys; there's nothing on sale today in Topeka stores with "made in Ciernmny" stamped upon it.

A Those already on sale here are of better materials and workmanship and are more practical than those that used to come .from the kaiser's domain, merchant say. , Take, for instance, the dolls on sale this year. They are made from Amer ican materials, by skilled American workmen, wno possess the u"ai American efficiency. Lots and lots of them are unbreakable, and jet thev have all the delicacy and beauty of those that used to come across the water, and those from Germany were very delicate in construction a little tap on the head and they were worth less. Then there are "construction tovs. practical and educative, in Heu a( the gilded trinkets heretofore on sale. , . The Rrent outstanding feature or This Christmas, however, will be the :'act thut the martial spirit of young America in all his enthusiasm Will be satisfied in the array and supply of "war" toys. There are guns, toy ones of course, but they shoot, battleships, aii-whips, nistols, cannon and one store even exhibits a toy trench with barbed-wire entanglements, defended by toy soldiers. Tovs. this year, are going to be a bit- higher in price than in forn.er years. The merchants say it's be cause of the better material and work manship. To a great extent this rea son is probably a valid one. However, si i..e firms may sell the cheaper toys' at a hitrher price, "Just because they grabs excess profits this Christmas is nut a good American, but it is too true that he can be found in most every city and his name is Mr. Profit Hogg, ta.

Wholesale men. when it was time to order, shied at bringing in the trees and now Cope is lamenting the fact that he didn't get more. Truly, the shadow of war isn't going to affect the Yuletide mer riment. The Christmas business re ported by merchants already is lndl caf've of that. The supply of holly, smilax, mag nolia and mistletoe will be normal, according to Cope. Prices will also be about normal. "There will be enough mistletoe to insure kisses for every giil in town," said Cope. "If she doesn't get her share. It'll be her own fault."

Forty billion dollars per year Ave times Ger many's annual war expense Is what it is costing the allies to eliminate the Hohenzollern menace, according to figures furnished by reliable sources here today. ; While Germany is spending JiOO, 000,000 monthly, according to -.:her own admission. Great Britain and America will spend $29,000,000,000 during the first year of the country's participation in the war. France, Italy and other entente powers; will bring the total up .to the $40,000, 000,000 mark, it was authoritatively stated today. Has Cost Germany 25 Billion. That the. central powers' yearly war debt is nearer $8,000,000,000 than the $6,000,000,000 they admit is the belief of- British and American offi cials. Prior to June 30, 1917, Ger many had expended more than $25, 000,000,000. The Teuton persistency in camouflaging means that this fig ure is greatly underestimated, officials declare. i Great Britain, tho she has virtually financed the entente for three years, is still the world's banker. During the six months ending September 30 since America entered the war she loaned in cash to her allies, $1,305, 000,000. Her loans the last eighteen months exceed $3,975,000,000, while the total American loans to date are less than $3,000,000,000. America's contribution to the ifus-sian- war chest $190.000,000 re garded as enormous here, dwindled into insignificance when compared with the amounts England has sunk in the ex-czar's domain. Previous to Kerensky's downfall, Britain's bank ers had given Russia credit for more than $3,000,000,000. it was authorita tively learned today. j MEANS DEFENDS SELF Attorney on Trial for Murder Tells of His Activities as Spy.

Lad Insists He Sold Tires for , Another Boy. Insistence of Carl Linder, a youth, that he did not steal two automobile tires and other junk from a North Topeka merchant and had sold them for Carrol Kaggee, another boy, with held prosecution of Linder for two weeks. Meantime, it is up to Linder or the Topeka police to find Kaggee or it is likely Linder will go to jail. "I'll tell you what I'll do," said Hugh Fisher, assistant county attor ney. - "We'll continue this case until two weeks from today and let you find Kaggee." Linder was on trial in the court of Topeka today charged with petit lar ceny. He admitted he had sold the tires, but declared that he had done so at the request of Carroll Kaggee. who had stopped him on the street and asked him to sell them on Sat urday afternoon in order that Kag gee might not lost his turn in a bar-, ber shop. The entire outfit was sold for $1.46.' A few hours later Linder was ar rested. He testifies that he told city detectives that he had sold the stuff for Kaggee. x "Instead or trying to find Kaggee," said Linder, "they told me they were going to get a confession out of me. They struck me in the face and kicked ine. Since that time I have been searching for Kaggee by myself. He has moved from his home on East Fifth street and I haven't been able to locate him. He used to be a ward of this court." Linder's attorney questioned wheth er the detectives had used such dras tic third degree methods as described' by his client. However, he declared, it behooves the police to aid in find ing Kaggee and ascertaining whether Linder's story is true, or not. An other lad who was with Linder on the day he is accused of stealing the tires and junk, testified that Kaggee had stopped them on the street and asked Linder to sell the tires and junk. Linder had been working for the Wolff Packing Co. He lives at 80 4 North Topeka avenue. Linder is out on bond. RUMANIAJN PACT? Berlin Announces Balkan State Has Joined Russ Armistice Plan.
