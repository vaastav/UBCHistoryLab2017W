No New Deal ok Skats The resolution of Mr. Starkweather introduced yesterday to have a new drawing for seat* came up this morning as unfinished boiinriw, and after the usual con test b?tween the mbers having front *?ats and those in the back settlements the resolu vas rejected to the disgust of the latter. A Labor Br reap.? In the House yesterday ?fternoon, on motion of Mr. Killinger, ol Pa., the committee on education au-J labor was directed to iuqnlre into the expediency of estab lishing a labor bureau in eonneetion with the de I artment of agriculture, in recognition of the rights of the labor classes. See ator Turn bi-ll is reported by the Wash ington correspondent of the Louisville Courier Journal as saying that he would not accept a Presidential nomination from the Democricv or the "Possn mites;" thinks President (iranto'ight to he re-elected: has friendly |K*rsonal relation.* with him. and in the main sup{*orts his admin istration. A F ioatiBo I rob Dock?Secretary Robe son to-day o|>ened bids for building a floating iron dock, intended for the repair of naval ves sels on theirstations. About halt a dozen bld? *'*e received, all of them being from the north and west The Secretary reserved hi* decision. The successful bidder will be required to give security in the-sum of gtiOft.OOU for the faithful I>erformance or his duty. A Carers of republican Senators was held at the Capitol this morning, and a committee con sisting of Messrs. Buckingham (chairman), Saw yer, Poroerov, Frelinghuysen and Ferrv was ap pointed to report what revision, if any, should be made in the standing committees of' the Sen ate. No actum whatever was taken in regard to making any change in the officers of the Senate, and it seems to be the impression that none wil be takes. Thabstbrs of Naval officers Comma. do re Heed Wcrden has been ordered to com mand the naval station at New London, Conn. Captain J. C. Howell has been ordered to com mand the naval station at League Island, Pa. Captain .lames F. Armstrong has l>een ordered to duty as executive officer at the Mare Island, California, navy yard. Commodore James M. Frailey has been detaehed from the command of the naval station at League Inland, Pa., and placed on waiting orders. The Nicholas P. Trist Case Judge Wylle, holding the equity term, heard, yester day afternoon, arguments by Gen. B. F. Butler and Thomas J. Durant in the case of Linns Childs, wLo sues Nicholas P. Trist, now post master at Alexandria, Va., for some $3,."500, his claim for services in pushing through CongTess a claim of Mr. Trist for services in negotiating the treaty of peace with Mexico. The plaintiff' sets lorth that some of his fsrrii'C consisted in urging the claim upon Mr. Sumner's attention, Arc. The defendant demurred to the bill, alleging that, for reasons of public policy, no right or action could arise from such a claim. Jndge Wy lie held the case for future decision. Postal Tele6rai'iis During the discus sion In the lIoiM of Representatives yesterday afternoon, on the resolution of Mr. Dawes re ferring the several portions of the President's message to the committees, Mr. Handall warinlv opposed the reference of the subject of postal telegraphs to a special committee, and con tended that a standing committee of tli? House was the proper place for its consideration. Messrs. Beck, Farnsworth, Niblack and others look the same ground, and were replied to l>y Messrs. Dawes, Garfield and others. After con siderable discussion, the subject was referred to the Committee on Appropriation" by a large vote. The friends of the change argue that should the government purchase the telegraph lines of the country nearly one million ofcdollar* jtr annum can be saved In rents alone, as that sum is now paid by the telegraph companies for the buildings used by them, while the gov ernment could. If it owned the lines, locate the offiees in ?ost officcs, custom-houses, aud other plibUc buildings. The Natiobal Tobacco Cobykjitios met at 11 o'clock to-day, in the parlors of the Metro politan Hotel. There were only nine states rej> ruentrd, many memlters who are expected tn be present not having yet arrived. Vine Presi dent l^wis II. Frayser, of Virginia, occupied 4be chair, with John Straiton. ol New York, secretary. A committee of one from eaeh >tat? represented was ordered to be ap|*>inted bv the chair to make nominations for officers to serve the ensuing year. Several communications were received from absent members, all recommending action towards a reduc tion of the tax on tobacco to a uni form rate of sixteen cents per pound. Acting President Loring Palmer, Ksq., of Sew j York, then read a carefully prepared address, recommending a united effort to reduce the tax on the borne production, but recommending tlie continuance of the duty on imported tobacco. On the Motion to adopt the recommendations contained in the address, n discussion arose; the cigar BMMiufacturing interest present opposing the continuance of the duty. Finally a motion was adapted to receive both the address** and enter them mm the recorded proceedings for fu itnre use. On motion ?T Mr. Bailev, of Hew York, a committee of nine was -appointed to prepare business to present to the convention at a session to be held at 7 o'clock this evening. Qbberal Sukrjiab's Recohmebdatiob*.? Gcasral Sherman, In hisanraaJ repert, endorses the recommendation of General Hallech that the sphere of action of the amy tn gmmti civil eases should be better defined by statute, bet in Ike absence ef each statute we can only rely apon the intelligence nnd mod sense of the officers specially encaged. Thus for few mis takes if any have been made, and the conduct of the troops has aset the be arty approval of the eonrts, the civil officers, and even the inhabi tants againet whoa they have been compelled to act General Sherman also recommends that Con gress "give the President the discretionary power to keep the onm pontes up to a standard ranging between sixty and one hundred privates, according to the nature ef the service required of the toaepe. Bach a measure would adn very much to the efficiency, and would rarely if ever carry the aggregate strength of the active army above the i tsnifird ef thirty thousand men now tied by law." The Oenerd again earnestly reeommends "the great necessity that new regulations be Citk d for the government of the armv," and mam aniform system of tactics be adopted, embracing rsmmra principles for haMMng all the arms of the service when brought under a commander. The whole theory M army move ments is based upon the foct that one respon sible head should central masses of men, and this cannot be done efficiently wi?ere one set of tactics is used for lnfontry. another for cavalry and still another for artillery.

Cnrtin, onr Minister at St. Petersburg, Is dated Jiiuo lOih, and s. ?tes: " 1 am directed to Inform vuu that the conduct oi Mr. Catacazy, the Minister of Kusr-la lierc, l>oth official and personal, has for some t.rne past bee n such as to materially im pair Lis usefulness to his government, and to rtnder interconre wtth him lor either busing or social purposes hlghlv disagrceale. I'nder these clrcumstanccs the President is ot the e>p:nion that the interests ol both countries would be promoted and those relations of cordi ality with the government of the Czar, of the importance of which he is well aware, would be placed u|?on a much Mirer tooting if Uie head of the Russian Legation here were to be changed." Another letter oi Secretary Fish to Minister Curtin, dated November 16th, last, states that on bis arrival at Washington Mr. Catacazy gave Komise of being a useful and very acceptable inister, and made an agreeable impression. Soon, however, he began to make him?ell very officious, interfering in questions not appropri ately connected with his legation and in those I tending before Congr?-as, importuning Senators and Representatives, and resorting to personal interviews and solicitations unusual on the part of the representatives of other powers accredited to this government, distasteful and annoying to the legislators thus indecorously approached, and tending to embarrass the free course of legislation on the subjects with respect to which his Interference was obtruded. He did not hesitate to use the newspai>ers of the country to influence public opinion u|>on ques tions pending before the government, and in dulged in much licenm- In his denunciation of measures and of individuals. In his conversa tions he was even more severe and unrestrained and employed abusive, vituperative lang'uige towards very many persons, including several in public positions and enjoying the respect and confidence of the community. The improprlety of a foreign minister thus attempting to influ ence and to misdirect the pa bile opinion of the country must 1m* admitted as sufficient ground for bis censing to be a proper agent between the government which be represents and that to which he is accredited. A dispatch from Minister Curtain to Secre tary Fish HUiiounces that tlic n .juej?t for the re call ot Mr. Catacaey bail wot been i?reseute*d, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs was absent anil the under Secretary thought It was a matter of too much importance for him tu act upon. To this Secretary Fish replied that the Bosnian Minister of Foreign Affairs could be reached, and it was important that the matter should Ik? settled before the visit of theliraud Duke to this country, as the President could not be expected to receive as the principal attendant to his iligliiu v ore who ha* been abusive ot* himvlt and isrsonally unacceptable. Finally, the Russian government requested that M. Cata cazy lie tolerated here until after the presenta tlon of the Grand Duke to the President, and to I this reqoe-st our government acceeded. Hence Mr. Catscsy ceased to refwesunt the Russian Empire after the presentation. 9 Tm Catholic Missionaries The North German steamship Berlin, Capt.
