CHOLERA IN MINNE SOTA. Editor Wise, of Mankato, calls our attention to a dispatch from the south ern part of the state that appeared some time since in some of the Twin City dailies, saying that cholera was raging among the hogs in that section, and stating'specifically that 150 had died in one day on a farm near Blue Earth City. He denies the report in toto, and advises editors receiving similar mes sages hereafter to kill them.and also the sender. The mischief in such state ments is that they are taken up by the press of other states and reported abroad, and discredit our pork in home and foreign markets. -Some ten years ago what was lied the cholera raged among the herds of swine in Southeastern Minnesota on the upland farms, where the water supply for stock was the artificial ponds, in which the water became stagnant and filthy; and the disease was confined iv I such- localities, except as it was trans j in lied by contagion. .Willi the advent \ «d the* drillers and a supply ot pure : water the disease disappeared, and has j never since appeared there or elsewhere I in the s ate. - | a*!;-.

The deaths, he says, have i been entirely among these imported hogs, ami that tiie cause is not coolers is shown by the fact that the disease does not spread to native pigs in the ] tine herd. . ****** j THE PKi.SIDK.NT's M.*B9AGK. The message of the president, which we lay before our read* in full this morning, will be read with many dif-a fering shades of interest iv and out of his own party. There will be tho chronic cynicism of the implacable in the opposition, to whom no good could come from that source, who will read it solely to find where they can hang a sneer or slur; and in the president's parly it will be read with comments vary from the approval of the cnn«s servative element to expressions of disappointment by the radical wing. While a large space is given to a pres entation of our relations with other nations, there is nothing of a serious nature in them, and what there is that is troublesome grows out of our tariffs. The attitude ot Germany towards our meat products is solely the result of our discrimination against her sugar, in contravention of our treaty with her, and to the same cause is due the strained relations with Spain, who retaliates through her customs sharply aud an uoyingly. But these matters do not in terest the general public as do the two topics of the tariff and the currency, which take up the closing portions of this long message. The recommendations on the tariff are a distinct disappointment to those in the party who saw in the opening of congress following the defeats of No vember an opportunity for the presi dent to point the party more than the congress to the causes and the future course the party should take. They felt that he had the opportunity to com mit the party to a (creator and a better cause than that he gave it in 1887, and that he might have spoken words that would have reinvigorated and inspired. Those, however, who regarded the Wilson bill as it came to the house as a full redemption of the Chicago plank, will look on his recommendation that the differential and discriminating taxes on sugar and those on coal and iron be removed as being all that could be ex pect, d of him. His recommendations on the currency will be satisfactory to all who are not infected with the greenback heresy or the free silver mania. These will resent his rebuke of congress for failing to make provision for the repletion of the gold reserve when, under our vicious currency jumble of systems, it became depleted. His distinct announcement that the treasury will issue bonds whenever needed to maintain that, fond will grate on the ears of the soft and cheap money men in all parties; but as they cannot repeal the act of 1873, they will have to content themselves with grumbling. The conditions and discussions in the press and magazines of our so-called currency "system" mada it an easy guess for the Washington correspond ents to represent the president as pon dering some plan of uniformity to sub mit to congress, but they were mistaken in guessing that he would recommend the Baltimore plan as adopted by the bankers' conference. There are two radically opposite propositions dealing with paper currency; the one is that all issues of paper should be made by the government; the other, that it should have nothing further to do with paper money than to authorize and regulate its issue by private persons. Mr. Cleve land takes the latter position, and urges a divorcement of the treasury from banking functions as soon and as fast as possible. The plan suggested by Secretary Carlisle and indorsed by tho president is in part the Baltimore plan of substi tuting a guarantee fund, made up of an annual tax on circulation, for bonds as security tor bills, but omits the bad feature of a federal guarantee. The secretary's plan contemplates a relief to the gold reserve in the requirement of a deposit of greenbacks or Sher mans equal to 80 per cent of the note is sue, which goes into the safety fund in case of failure of the bank; and if the safety fund be insufficient to re deem the notes.an assessment on all the banks is made. The system is made self-supporting by a tax on the circula tion enough to defray expenses of the supervision by the government. These features keep the government within the limits of its function of "coining money and regulating the value there of," which implies the regulation of issues of substitutes for metallic money. But the novel feature is the extension of the plan to state banks, by repealing the 10per cent tax on the issues of those banks which assure the treasury that they practically conform to the provis ions of the national act. The proposi tion to repeal that tax standing alone was opposed even by those who regard ed the tax as a usurpation of the taxing power for a purpose other than revenue, but who felt that a sound currency was a necessity that excused the act. These persons have felt that hand in hand with the repeal should go some act that would insure the solvency of the notes of the state banks. This the secretary's plan does. With this feature incorpo rated in a measure it is very probable that it would pass congress at this ses sion, offering, as it docs, a relief to tlnse portions of the country pressed for more money and demanding free coinage of silver because of their needs. **» Sodden Conservatism Keeps It. Boston Herald. It is in tiie nature of an anomaly in the the operation of - our government that the existing congress, which has been repudiated by them, should tie at once called in to legislate, while that chosen should have to wait a year be fore it can be operative.

SAINT PAUL DAILY GLOBE: TUESDAY MORNim, DECEMBER 4, mi MESSAGE DISCUSSED. Wilson Much Elated Over the Free Iron and Coal Rec ommendations. SPRINGER INDORSES IT. Other Congressmen Consider It Businesslike, Vigorous and Able. WATTERSON CRITICISES. Comments of Other Leading: Journalists on the Doc ument. Washington:, Dec. 3.—Speaker Crisp had ou opportunity to examine the mes sage carefully, owing to the frequent interruptions, and was not prepared to talk until he had done so. Mr. Wilson, chairman of the ways and means committed, expressed his great gratification over the president's vigor ous recommendation of the free coal and iron bills sent to the senate, and his indorsement of the recommendation for the abolition of the differential ou re filled sonar.  Mr. Bryan (Dem., Neb.) said he was opposed to any financial scheme which would give private individuals the pow er to issue money. Mr. Harter (Dem., O.) characterized the president's banking scheme as a good, long step In the right direction, but personally he thought he ought to go further. The government, in his opinion, ought not to guarantee the payment of national bank notes or of any corporation. Mr. Springer (Dem., 111.) said the president's devotion to routine recom mendations in reference to the business of tariff suggestions is wise and time ly. The business interests of the coun try may rest assured that there is to be a long period of rest so far as the gen eral tariff legislation is concerned. Mr. Bailey (Dem., Tex.) is opposed to the government becoming a surety for the promissory notes of any business corporation, even though it be a bank. Senator Mitchell (Rep., Or.)— His whole financial scheme is impossible, it is a proposition really going back to old wild cats. Senator Blanchard (Dora., La.)—l ap prove of state banks recommendation. I am opposed to the repeal of one-eighth, and one-tenth of a cent differential on sugar, for the reason that 74 per cent of 7,000,000 pounds of sugar produced in Louisiana shares in the differential. Senator iiansbrougli (Rep., >. D.)—l had heard that the president was suffer ing from the gout, and the message con firms it. He recommends a decrease in the tariff, notwithstanding the deficit, and makes no recommendation for the increase of revenue. Senator , Perkins (Rep., Cal.)—l like his recommendation for an increase in the navy, but am opposed to his free shipping proposition. Senator Vilas (Dem., Wis.)—lt is a good business message. Senator Chandler (Rep., N. IL)—The message is a very commonolace docu ment. Mr. Reed, of Maine, had nothing to say with regard to the message. Mr. Burrows, of Michigan, had no comment to make. Gen. Catching**] (Dem.. Miss.), one of the committee on rules, strongly in dorsed the president's financial views. The scheme of making state banks banks of issue under federal supervis ion for the redemption of the notes would, he thought, emancipate the banks of the interior from the great financial institutions of the money cen ters, especially in times of stringency, and furnish a safe and elastic currency. Of the Democratic members of the senate committee on finance Senators Voorhees, Harris and Vest asked to be excused from expressing any opinion on the financial views advanced by the president, and Senator Jones, of Arkan sas, would only repeat what he had heretofore said, that he did not believe that any financial legislation would be possible during the present session. Republican members of the committee were almost as disinclined to talk as their Democratic colleagues. Senator Sherman would go no further than to say the message contained nothing striking. Senator Allison declared it was not a time for Republicans to take the lead. Senator Gorman, while declining to directly discuss the recommendations of the message, said that at the short session, which was now beginning, ac tion would depeud largely upon the willingness ot the Republicans to per mit anything to be done. Senator Brice (Dem., 0.)-The Balti more plan strikes me as a pure dream. Its adoption would certainly demoralize the finances of the country. Senator Teller (Rep., Col.)—I cannot see that the message offers any relief for the country, and it appears to me as if the president faiied to comprehend the financial or political conditions. Senator Hoar (Rep., Mass.)—lt Is a message without courage or vigor, indi cating in every sentence the president's consciousness of public disapproval. Can this be haughty Marmion? Senator Caffery (Dem., La.) — With reference to the president's recom mendation on the sugar differential. 1 have my views, but prefer to withhold them for the present. Senator Stewart—The financial plan in Mr. Cleveland's message, stripped of its verbiage, means that the United States shall give bankers $75 for $22.50. Any bank that will deposit $22.50 of legal tender, whether greenbacks or treasury notes, will receive $75 of our government money, a cunning way of retiring greenbacks, it removes all re strictions of the banking law against expansion ana contraction by the banks to enable them and their associates to "rig" the market.

OTHER OPINIONS. Watterson Criticises the Message as Uninteresting*. Lovisvii.i.k, Ky., Dec. 3. — The Courier-Journal will say: The presi dent's annual message, transmitted to congress yesterday, is unusually long, and is almost as uninteresting as it is long. Aside from tho indorsement and synopsis of .Secretary Carlisle's plan for currency reform, with one or two recommendations, the message has but little other significance than attaches to a clerk-like condensation of the various department reports. In this respect it is very different from some of the pre ceding messages of Mr. Cleveland. The feature that will attract most attention is the recommendation of a plan looking to the commendable object of divorcing the government from the business of banking, and providing for an ample, elastic aud perfectly safe bank cur rency. Cleveland, 0., Dec. 3.—The Plain dealer wiil say: The president is noth ing if not tenacious of his opinions, lie still clings to the idea that coal and iron ore should be placed upon the free list. hut he gives no reasons for it. The president- is silent, and by his silence approves the tariff on raw su«,iu*. It strikes us that raw sugar is a pretty raw material, and if his logic is good against a tariff on coal, iron and wool, certainly he ought to advo ate putting sugar on the free i'st. 1 lie policy which the president advocates of external.g our commerce ami enlarging our mer chant marine Is to be commended by every patriotic, citizen. Tne president rightfully indorses the civil service re form and the reorganization of the Union Pacific* Hail way company so as to take it out of the hands of a re ceiver. The Leader says the message Is re markable for nothing but the president's financial recommendations, which, It de clares, are intended to please the Popu lists and Democrats of the South and West, and which, if carried out, would result in the revival of wild-cat cur rency and the material weakening ot the national banking system by decreas ing the security of the bill-holders and leaving depositors at the mercy of dis honest bank officials. Kansas Cn\, Dec. 3.—The Journal (Hep.) says: The president's message is a document which will attract atten tion only because of its length, and not because of handling of subjects in which the American people are interested. The document is a disappointment to the people and must be a humiliation to his adherents. ° The Times (Dem.) says the striking* feature of President Cleveland's annual message is its lucidity and comprehen siveness. Th-* surprising feature of the document is the absence of any recom mendations that would invite conten tion. The message is written in that vigorous style and rugged peri ods which mark all the state papers of Mr. Cleveland. It is likely to make a profound impression ou congress and ihe country. St. Lot'is, Mo., Dec. 3.—The Globe- Democrat will say: The message of President Cleveland this year is the longest one he has ever written, and tho one that contains the least matter of original interest and importance, lt is composed mainly of abstracts of the reports of the different departments, with passing leconimendations upon points that do not particularly affect the general welfare. Cincinnati, Dee., 3.— The Commer cial Gazette (Rep.) says: The presi dent's message shows a weakening on the tariff, and is lacking in any reme dial measures after the popular ex pressions therefor the past two years. Heretofore it was understood President Cleveland would veto a free silver bill. Now it Is reasonable to infer a Pill for limited coinage upon a basis of 10 to 1 would be signed. The message will create a measure of renewed distrust and general anxiety. Conservative and Judicious. New Orleans, La., Dec. 3.—The Picayune says in substance: It is doubt ful it there has ever been presented to a congress a more conservative and judicious address than that sent in by President Cleveland. It is free from radical views and aggressive proposals, and should create harmony in the councils of the party. It is the first time Mr. Cleveland has failed to burden his message with a policy. Once he dwelt upon the neces sity for civil service reform; another time it was tariff reform, and still at an other it was a radical course in Hawaii, and at auother an anti-silver policy. This time the president has sept free from any violent positivism, and he has done well. ' The Times-Democrat will say: Presi dent Cleveland's message is what might be called a lardy message. The president has been laid up for the last two or three weeks with gout, or some ailment of that sort, and the message bears traces of compulsory inactivity, for it is made up in large measure of condensations of the cabinet ministers' reports. There is a less of original matter in the message today, and less, too. of that robust intellectu ality which used to be one of the most noticeable characteristics of Mr. Cleve land's public documents. The message in fact makes the remote suggestion that its author might probably be "los ing his grip." Nashville. Term,, Dec. 3. — The American will say: With the veto power which Mr. Cleveland holds, and which he will unquestionably exercise if necessary.i auy further attemptud legislation upon the silver question by this congress will be a mere waste of time, lt is therefore the duty of every true Democrat to accept" the inevitable and labor earnestly for the enactment of the very best financial legislation that can possibly be accom plished looking towards a perfect and complete separation of the government from the banking business, to the re moval of the control of the currency from the hands of a few national bunk ers and its restoration a3 nearly as may be to the people themselves.. meets All Expectations. Detroit, Mich., Dec. 3.—The Free Press will say: In the main, it meets all just expectation, though the oppo nents of the income tax will be disap pointed to find in it no confirmation of their hopes for a recommendation to nullify tbat enactment by not appropriating the funds neces sary to put it in operatiou. In the closing portion of his message the president comes up most fully to the public expectation. His declarations that we ought to have tree coal and free iron, and above all that the differen tial duty in favor of refined sugar should be stricken off, are in entire accord, we believe, with popular judgment. The Tribune wiil say: Mr. Cleveland acknowledges that gold is at present the only money of final redemption. The president meets the situation with great courage and great obstinacy. He insists that he will maintain the gold reserve and Keep right on selling bonds whenever it, shall be neces sary to keep the gold reserve at.sloo. --000,000. In that he is courageous. He is obstinate in that he ignores the real necessity of the hour, and that his hos tility to silver stands like a stone wall to prevent any legislation looking to a restoration of a bimetallic policy. Memphis. Term., Dec. 3— The Com mercial Appeal will say the president broadly intimates that the action of Germany In excluding importations of live stock and fresh meat from this country is due to the provisions of our custom act imposing a discriminat ing duty of one cent a pound on sugars coming from countries that pay an export bounty thereon. The message recommends a repeal of such duty in the interest of commerce. We do not feel inclined to approve this recommendation. An export bounty paid by a foreign country operates to the disadvantage of tho American prod uct. A discriminating duty in such cases is not a ptotection against fair competition but against unfair competi tion. Too Brief on Currency. St. Louis, Mo., Dec. 3.—The Repub lic (Dem.) will say: Mr. Cleveland's message would have been more useful if he had elaborated his views upon tie currency, and referred briefly to the reports of his secretaries on other sub jects, instead of stating other subjects and fully contenting himself with an indorsement of Secretary Carlisle's plan for a change in the currency, Reorganization of the currency is by far the most important subject that has been urged by any president since the war. In the absence of settled knowl edge in their own minds the great mass of citizens would very much like to have at length the reasons which have in duced Mr. Cleveland to give his unqual ified approval to a reversal of the whole monetary system of the country. Cincinnati, 0., Dec. 3.—The En quirer (Dem.) criticises the message throughout severely. It says: The most interesting feature of the presi dent's recommendation of withdrawal from the Berlin treaty in his recognition of congress as having some authority concerning our foreign relations. That the president should think it worth while to consult congress in this .matter is a most encouraging sign of the beneficial effect upon him of his experience in the Hawaiian busi ness. The message is pronounced "rheu matic and gouty." San I-'iivm [si■(>. D,.. 3.—The Ex aminer will say: Iho president in his message favors the abolulion of "every particle ot differential duty in favor of refined sugar" and the abolution of the retaliatory duty on refined Imported from countries that pay export bounties, If he had taken this stand at the close of the last session instead of permitting Mr. Carlisle to identify the adminis tration with the sugar trust, something might have turned out differently. 

CHICAGO COMMENT. Tribune Calls It a business Me«> . Ciikaoo, Dec." 3.—The Tribune: With the exception of the brief tariff statement aud the somewhat longer 'financial statement, the message is purely clerical, and reflects the routine work ot the departments. Summed up, it is a long business message without partisan exaltation on the one hand or useless mourning over recent catas trophes on the other, aud with evident suggestions of gout. The Record says: The president's unequivocal declaration that ho will maintain the national currency on a gold basis at any cost in bonds should uispel all doubts on that score if such doubts have still existed anywhere. The recommendation that the discrimi . nating duty against German sugars be removed, mid that free coal, free iron and free ships be granted to the citizens ot this country merely serve to empha size the small figure cut by tariff argu ments in this message. The Times will say: Undaunted by what the. Republican organ- are pleased to call the verdict against free trade, Mr. Cleveland demands free coal, free iron ore and free ships. lie even sug gests that if revenue considerations would permit he "would be glad, under existing aggravations, to see every par ticle of differential duty stricken out of our tariff law"—an expression winch a vast body of people of the United Slates, victims of trusts fostered by these du ties will heartily echo. The president's currency recommendations the Times has nuled in another column only to emphatically condemn. The Herald will say: The annual message of President Cleveland is very much in earnest throughout, and those portions which express his personal views of public policy and the principles of government, with his usual force and directness. On the whole it is a satisfactory document, which clears up the situation amazingly, which wili ex cite but little hostile criticism aud which is s creditable American state paper. Chicago, Dec. 3.—The Inter Ocean says of the president's banK note policy: The Inter Ocean does not fear the actual adoption of this wildcat system. The house may pass it. and probably will, but tho Republicans of the senate surely will prevent its passage in that body. If necessary the regular appropriations should be blocked. Better, infinitely bolter, a special session of the congress-elect iv the spring than the overturning of our present monetary system, with a return to oue fundamentally the same as the old ante- state bank bill system. 

GROWLS FKOM GOTHAM. Severe Newspaper Criticism on the Message. New York, Dec. 3. -The Staats Z ei tung—His plan for currency reform is evidently not quite matured. Although offering a sufficiently sound basis for the security of bank notes, tho security for bank depositors will be reduced, and for this reason we do not believe that the banks will be in duced to issue notes on this basis. The message is not lacking in interesting points, but it must be said that on the whole it does not come up fully to the situation. The president has not shown sufficient courage to read an object les son to tho American people from the terrible disasters his party has met, and from the general political and economic situation of the country. Although he does not retreat before his adversaries, he is no longer as aggressive as he was in 1887, New York, Dec. 3.—Press: Mr. Cleveland's demand for more free trade legislation is an insult to the American people and an essential denial of the rihht of popular sovereignty by a pop ular plurality of more than a mill ion and a half to the American people condemned Clevelandism, rejected free trade. If obstruction in the senate is necessary in order to enforce the peo ple's mandate, then let obstruction be used fearlessly and resolutely. New York, Dec. 3.—World: The message is as a whole disappointment. There is no claar note of leadership in it. It csutalus not the slightest recog nition of the causes of the late overwhelming disaster to the Demo cratic party, lt has not a word indicat ing the purpose to amend the faults and correct the blunders that contributed to this defeat. 

BRITISH PRESS. Currency Proposals Criticised by limes and Standard. London*. Dec. 4.—The Times thinks Secretary Carlisle's plan is probably the best devisable • under the circum stances. The prospect of carrying any currency reform* in the present con gress is rather hopeless, but the fact that the shrewd managers of New York banks helped the treasury by sub scribing for the gold loan shows they still hope that congress will listen to reason. If it does not, the American people are within a measurable distance of being forced into adopting a silver standard whether they wish to do so or not, for the treasury's gold cannot again be replenished. London, Dec. 4. — The Standard thinks that the framers of Secretary Carlisle's proposals in gazing into the distaut future, take too little into ac count what may happen in the mean time. How will the plan put cash into the treasury to meet the various pres ent and future demands? Gold reserves in the treasury can only be re plenished without risk by changing the budget deficits into surpluses and ac cumulating these surpluses into gold. Secretary Carlisle's proposals are weak and impossible. America docs not want more of currency legerdemain. She wants honest money. Gov. Oatea' Opinion. Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 3.—Com menting on the banking clause in Pres ident Cleveland's message, Gov. Gates said: "There Is * little too much cen tralization in the president's banking scheme to please state rights Democrats, but lt would be a great improvement on the present banking system, and 1 heartily approve it."

This will be between 2,500,000 and 2,(500,000 tons. They also decided to advance tidewater prices to the following, f. o. b., gross: Broken, 13.50" egg, $3.00; stove, $3.75.

One set of charges made by Good Government clubmen embraces over three hundred specific cases, while another set, presented by the German- American He form union makes exactly 501.

Moreover, the frequent changes in its course through level sands often raise embarrassing questions of territorial jurisdiction. Hlueiield*-. Prominent among the questions of the year was the Bluefields incident iv what is known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bordering.on the Atlantic ocean, and within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of PiOO between Great Britain and Nicaragua the former gov ernment expressly recognized the sover eignty of the latter over the strip, and a limited form of self government was guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be exercised according to their customs, for themselves and other dwellers with in its limits. The so-called native government, which grew, to be largely made up of aliens, for many years disputed the sovereignly of Nicaragua over the strip, and claimed the right to maintain a practically inde pendent government Early in the past year efforts of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over the Mosquito territory led to serious disturbances, culminating in the suppression or the native govern ment and the attempted substitution of an impracticable composite administra tion, in which Nicaragua and alien resi dents were to participate. Failure w.as followed by an insurrection,which for a time subverted Nicaragua.: rule, expel ling her officers and restoring the old organization. This in turn gave place to the existing local government estab lished and upheld by Nicaragua, Al though the Alien line re-sis arrayed against Nicaragua in these transactions have been largely Amer ican, and the commerce of that region for some time has been and still is con trolled by our citizens, we cannot for thai reason challenge the rightful sover eignty of Nicaragua over this important part of her domain. For some montns and during part of the time two of onr naval 6hips have been stationed at Biueficlds for the protection of all legit imate interests of our citizens. In Sep tember last the government at Managua expelled from its territory twelve or more foreigners, including two Amer icans, for alleged participation in the seditions or revolutionary movements against the republic at Bluetields al ready mentioned.but through the earnest remonstrance of this government the two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful management or their business. Our naval commanders at the scene of these disturbances, by their constant exhibition of firmness and good judgment, contributed largely to the prevention of more serious con sequences and to the restoration of quiet and order. 1 regret that in tho midst of these occurrences there happened a most grave and irritating failure of Nicaraguan justice. An American citi zen named Wilson, residing at liaamk, Mosquito territory, was murdered by one Arguello, tfhe acting governor of the town. After some delay the mur derer was arrested, but so insecurely confined or guarded thai he escaped, and, notwithstanding our repeated de mands, it is claimed that his recapture has been impossible by reason of his flight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction. The Nicaraguan authorities, having given notice of forfeiture of their con cession to the canal company en grounds purely technical and not embraced iv the contract, have receded from that position. Peru, I regret to say, shows symptoms of domestic disturbance, due, probably, to the slowness of her recuperation from the distresses of the war of 1881. Weakened in resources, her difficulties in facing international obligations invite our kindly smpathy, and justify our for bearance in pressing our long" pending claims. i have felt constrained to tes tify this sympathy in connection with certain demands urgently preferred by other powers. The Lzcla Case. The government of Salvador having been overthrown by an abrupt; popular outbreak, certain of its military and civil officers, while hotly pursued by infuriated insurgents, sought refuge on board the United States war ship Ben nington, then lying in a Salvadorean port. Although the practice of asylum is not favored by this government, yet, in view or the imminent peril which threatened the fugitives, aud solely from consideration of humanity, they were afforded shelter by our naval com mander, and, when afterwards demand ed under our treaty of extradi tion with Salvador for trial on charges of murder, arson aud robbery, I directed that such of them as had not voluntarily left the ship be conveyed to one of our nearest ports, where a hearing could be had be fore a judicial officer 111 compliance with the terms of the treaty. On their ar rival at San Francisco such a proceed ing was promptly instituted before the United Stales district judge, who held that the acts constituting the alleged offenses were political, and discharged ail the accused except one, uegos, who was held for an attempt to murder. Thereupon 1 was constrained to direct his release, for the reason that an at tempt to murder was not one of the crimes charged against him and upon which his surrender to the Salvadorean authorities had been demanded. The people judge Dr. Price's baking powder by the sum total of its merits and achievements, not by the enviously jealous claims of rivals." RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA Harmonious—Disputes With Spain —Turkish Outrages. The recent death of the czar of Rus sia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government with his bereaved fam ily and the Russian people. As a fur ther demonstration of respect and friendship, our minister at St. Peters burg was directed to represent our gov ernment at the funeral ceremonies. The sealing interests of Russia in Mehring sea are second only to our own. A modus Vivendi has therefore been con cluded with the imperial government restrictive of poaching on the Russian rookeries and of sealing in waters which were not comprehended in the pro tected area defined in the Paris award. Occasion has been found to urge upon the Russian gov erument equality of treatment for our great life insurance companies whose operations have been extended through out Europe. Admitting, as wo do, for eign corporations to transact business in the Untied States, we naturally ex pect no less toleiance for our own in the ample fields of competition abroad. But lew cases of interference with nat uralized citizens returning to Russia have been reported during the current year. One Kizemenskt was arrested last summer in a Polish province on a reported charge of unpermitted renun ciation of Russian allegiance, but it transpired that the proceedings originat ed In alleged malfeasance committed by Kizeminski while an imperial official a number of years ago. Efforts for his release.which promised to be successful. , were iv progress when his death was ' reported. I)i«l>iite*. With Spain. Unreasonable and unjust cues im- Dosed by Spain on the vessels and commerce of the United Mates have de manded from lime to time during the last twenty years earnest remonstrance on the part of our government. In the immediate past exoroitant penalties have beeu imposed upou our vessels and goods by-customs authorities of Cuba and Porto Rico for clerical errors of the most trivial character in the man ifests or bills of lading.. In some cases fines anionutiug to thousands of dollars have been In vied' upon cargoes or the carrying vessels, when the gi.ods in question wire entitled to free entry. Fines have been exacted even when the error had been detected and the Span ish authorities notified before the ar rival ol the goods in port. This conduct is in strange contrast with the considerate and liberal treat ment extended the Spanish vessels and cargoes In our ports in like cases. No : satisfactory settlement of these vexa- ! itioiisqiiestionjihas yet been reached. ! The Mora case*, eterivd to in my last annual message remains unsettled. ; From the diplomatic correspondence ou this subject which baa been laid before : the senate, it will be seen that this gov- ' ernment has offered to conclude a con- j vention with Spain for disposal by arbi- i tration of outstanding claims between the two [countries, except the Mora claim, which, having been long ago ad- ! justed, now only awaits payment as I stipulated, and of course it could not be i included in the proposed convention. It was hoped that this otter would re- ' move parliamentary obstacles encoun- j tered by the Spanish government in ! providing payment of the Mora indem- j nity. 1 regret to say that no definite I reply to this offer has yet been made, , and all efforts to secure "payment of this j settled claim have been unavailing. Outrage-* in Turkey. In my last annual message i adverted to the claim mi the part or Turkey of the right to expel, as persons undesirable and dangerous, Armenians naturalized in the United States and returning to Turkish jurisdiction. Numerous ques tions in this relation have arisen. While this government acquiesces in the as serted right of explsiou it will not con sent that Armenians may be imprisoned or otherwise punished lor no other rea son than having acquired without im perial consent American citizenship. Three of the assailants of Miss Melton, an American teacher in Mosul, have been convicted by the Ottoman courts, and 1 am advised that an appeal against the acquittal of the remaining five has been taken by the Turkish prosecuting officer. A convention has been concluded with Venezuela tor the arbitration ot a long-disputed claim growing out of the seizure of certain vessels, the oroperty ot citizens of the United States. Al though signed, the treaty of extradition with Venezuela is not" vet in force, owing to the insistence of that govern ment that, when surrendered, its citi zens shall iv no case be liable to capital punishment. The rules for the prevention of col lisions at sea which were framed by the maritime conference held in this city in 1889, having been con currently incorporated in the statutes of the United States and Great Britain, have been announced to take effect March 1, 1895, and invitations have been ex tended to all maritime nations to adhere to them. Favorable responses have thus far been received from Austria, France, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. SAMOAN EN t ANGL.ii*MEN fS. Advice That tho United Stater; Withdraw Reiterated. In my last annual message 1 referred briefly to the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Samoa, under the operation of the Berlin treaty, as signally illustrat ing the policy of entangling alliances with foreign powers, and on May 9, 1894, in lesponse to a resolution of the senate. I sent a special message and documents to that body on the same subject, which emphasized my previously expressed opinions. Later occurrences, the cor respondence in regard to which will be laid before congress, further demon strate that the government which was devised by the three powers and forced upon the Samoans against their inveter ate hostility can be maintained only by tho continued presence of foreign mili tary force at no sniuii sacrifice of life and treasure. The suppression of the Mataafa in surrection by the powers, and the ban* ishment of the leader and eleven other chiefs, as recited in my last message, did not bring lasting peace to the island. Formidable uprisings continued, and finally a rebellion broke in the capital, and revolts, headed in Aana, the West ern district, by the younger Tamasese, and in Atua, the Eastern district, by other leaders. The insurgents ravaged the country and fought the government troops up to the very doors of Apia. The king again appealed to the powers for help, and the combined British and German naval forces reduced the Atti ans to apparent subjection, not, how ever, without considerable loss to the natives. A few days later Tamasese and his adherents, fearing the marines, professed submission. Reports received from our agents at Apia do not justify the belief that the peace thus brought about will be of long duration... It is their conviction that the natives are at heart hostile to the present government; that such of them as profess loyalty to it. do so from fear of the powers, and that it would speedily go to pieces if the war ships were withdrawn. In reporting to his government on the unsatisfactory situa tion since the suppression of the late revolt by foreign armed forces, the Ger man consul at Apia stated: "That peace will be lasting is hardly to be presumed. The lesson given "by firing on Atua was not sufficiently sharp and incisive to leave a" lasting impression on the forgetful Samoan temperament. In fact, conditions are existing which .show that peace will not last, and is not seriously intended. Malietoa, the king, and his chiefs are convinced that the departure of the war snips will be a signal tor a renewal of the war. The circumstance that the representatives of the villages of all the districts which were opposed to the gov ernment have already withdrawn to Atua to hold meetings, and that both Atua and Aana have forbidden inhabi tants of those districts which fought on this side of the government to return to their villages, and have already partly burned down tho latter, indicates that a real conciliation of the people is still far off. And, in a note or the 10th ult., in closing a copy of that report for the information of the govern ment, the German ambassador said: "Tho contents of the report-awakened in the imperial government theapprenen sion that under existing circumstances the peace concluded with the rebels will afford no assurance of the restoration of lasting tranquillity in the islands." ihe present government has utterly tailed to correct, if, indeed, it has not aggravated the very evils it was intend ed to prevent. It has not stimulated our commerce with the islands. Our participation in its establishment against the wishes of the natives was in plain defiance of the conservative teachings and warnings of the wise and patriotic men who laid the foundations of our free institutions, and 1 invite an expression of the judgment of congress as to the propriety of steps being taken by this government looking to the with drawal from its engagements with other powers on some reasonable terms not prejudicial to any of our existing rights.
