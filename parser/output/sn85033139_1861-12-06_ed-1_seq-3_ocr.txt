Circular from the State Treasurer. State I reasurer II astikcs has issued the following circular to County Treasurers: Stats Treasurer's Office, } Madiscn, Nov. 27, 1861. )’ To Treat, it re i' of ,- Dear Sir; — To meet the interest on the State Bonds, and to pay for purchases male in New York, it will be necessary that a portion of the State tax soon to be collected,reach the Treasury in coin. As there is at the present time a large atnoT of coin in the hands of the people, it will be no hardship for one third, at leas?, of the Stale lax to te required in this shape* 1 lie balance will be received in isconsin currency, to the extent it is received fiom the tax payer. I have the most satisfac toiy assurances that a!! Wisconsin curren cy now cur .Rt, with the exception of the notes of the Dodg County Bank, Bank of Portage, and \\ atipnn Bank, the aggre- State circulation of which is less than £lO,- 000, will be redeemed so as to save the holders from a!! loss. In all cases where the banks issuing the notes fail to redeem as required by the amended banking law, the notes will be redeemed by the bankers’ association, and at once retired from cir dilation, and the non-redeeming banks wound up, without loss to tlie balder.— From careful investigations I am fully sat isfied with the correctness of these assur ames, and hesitate not to express the opinion that t’ ere will be no further trouble with Wisconsin currency.
