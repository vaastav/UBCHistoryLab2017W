A PKESIl)ENvrS MESSAGE. tWowxitlten of ttrfffemita - . 3 ' ' imZ'ttoWtf ' lUprmentathe : Throughout thoyear since onr, last jueeting. the country has been "eminently prosperous in all its material interests Tb general health has been ex cellent, our harvestvliave been abundant, and plenty smile throughout. the land Our commerce and Manufactures have been prosecuted with energy and Industry, and. have yielded fair and ample re turns. ' In short, no nation in the tide of tune has ever presented a saectacle of greater material pros-, peritr than we hare done until within a very recent period. - . . - ' ' '' '- Why is it, then; that discontent now so extensive ly prevails, arid the Union of the States, which is . the source of all these blessings is threatened with destruction ? The long-continued and intemperate, interference of the Northern people wita tn ques tion of rfarery in the Soutlwsrn States has at length produced its natural effects. The different sections of fee Union are now arrayed against each other, and the tine has arrived, o much dreaded by the Fattier of his Country k when hostile geographical parties hare been formenV I have long foreseen and fleo forewarned my ' countrymen of the now im pending danger. . This does not proceed solely from Ihe claim on the part of Congress or the territorial legislatures to exclude slavery from the -Territories nor from the efforts of different States to defeat the execution of the fugitive slave law. All or any of those evils might have been endured by the South without danger to the Union, (as others have been,) ; in the nope that time nd.' reflection might apply the-remedy. The .Immediate peril arises not so much from these causes as from the fact that the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery ques tion throughout the North for the last quarter of a century, has at length produced its malign influence on the slaves, and inspired them with vague notions of freedom. Hence a sense of security no linger exists around the family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to. apprehensions of awile insurrection. Many a matron throughout the-South retires at night in dread of what may befall herself and her children before the morning. Should, this apprehension of domestic danger, whether real or imaginary, extend and intensify : itself until it shall pervade the masses of the South ern people, then disunion will become inevitable. Self-preservation Is the -first law of nature, and has been. -implanted in the heart of man by his Creator for the wisest purpose; and no political union, however fraught with blessings and benefits in all other respects can long continue, if the necessary, consequence be to render the homes and the fire sides of nearly half the parties to it habitually and hopelessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds of such a Union must be severed. It is my conviction that this ftal neriod has not yet arrived; and my prayer to God is that He would prescrcve the Con- utitutioiuuid the Union throughout all generations But let us take warning in time, and remove tne cause of danger. It cannot be denied that, for five and twenty years, the agitation at the North against slavery in the South has been incessant In 1835 pictorial hand bills and inflammatory appeals, were cumulated extensively throughout the South, of a character to excite the passions of the slaves ; and, in the language of General Jackson, " to stimulate them to insurrection, and produce all the horrors of a servile war." This agitation has ever since been continued by the public press by the proceedings of State and county conventions, and by abolition sermons and lectures. The time of Congress has been occupied in violent speeches on this never ending subject; and appeals in pamphlet and other forms endorsed by distinguished names hae been sent forth from this central point, andspread broad er cast over the Union. : How easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery question forever, and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted county. -They, and they alone, can do it. All that is ne cessary to accomplish the object, and all for which the slave States have ever contended, is to be let alone, and permitted to manage their domestic in stitutions in their own way. . As sovereign States they, and they alone, are responsible before God and the world lor tne slavery existing aiming mem. For$his the people of the North are not more re sponsible, and have no more right to interfere, than with similar institutions in Russia or in Brazil. Upon their good sense and patriotic lorbearance I confess I still greatly rely. Without their aid. it is beyond the power of any President, no matter what may be his own political proclivities to restore peace. and harmony among the States. Wisely limited-and-restrained as is his power, under our Con stitution and laws lie alone can accomplish but lit tle, for; good or for evil, on such a momentous ques tion. - -;. , . , . And this brings me to observe that tne election of any one pf our fellow-citizens to the office of Presi dent does not of itself afford just cause for dissolving the Union. This is more especially true if his elec tion has been effected by a mere plurality, and not a majority of the people, and has resulted from tran sient and temporary causes which may probably never again occur. ' In order to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance, - the Federal Government . roust be guilty of ' a deliberate, palpable, and dan gerous exercise" of powers not granted by the Con stitution. The late presidential election, however, has been held in strict conformity with its express provisions. How, then, can the result justify a rev olution to destroy this very Constitution? Reason, justice, a regard for the Constitution, all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the President elect before resorting to such a remedy. It is said, however, that the antecedents of the President elect have been sufficient to justify the fears. of the South that he will attempt to invade their .constitutional rights. But are such apprehen sions' of contingent danger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noblest sys tem of government ever devised by mortals ? From the very nature of faU office, and its high responsi bilities he must necessarily be conservative. The stern-duty of administering the vast and complicat ed concerns of this Government affords in itself a guarantee that he will not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional right After all, he is no more than the chief executive officer of the Government His province is not to make, but to execute the laws ; and it is a remarkable fact in our history, that, not withstanding the repeated efforts of the anti-slavery : party, no single act has every passed Congress un less we may possibly except the Missouri Compro mise, impairing, in the slightest degree, the rights of the South to their property in slaves. '. And it may also be observed, judging from present indica tions that no probability exists of the passage of such an' act, by a majority of both Houses either in the present or. the next Congress. Surely, under these circumstances we ought to be restrained from present action by -the precept of Him who spake as never man spake,- -that "sufficient unto the day is the or U thereof." The day of evil may never come,, anlesa we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves. y It is alleged as one cause for immediate secession tut the Southern States are denied equal rights With the other States in the common Territories. ' But by what authority are these denied ? Not by Congress wich -has never passed, and I believe never will pass,' any-let to exclude slavery from these Territories; and certainly not by the Supreme Court, which has' solemnly decided that slaves are property? and, like all other property, their owners hav right to take them into the common Territo ries nd hold them there under the protection of the Constitution. ' .'-'-' .. '" ';v - ' r So.far, thea, as. Congress is concerned, the objec tion j not to anything they have already done, but to what the may do hereafter. It will surely be admitted that this apprehension of future danger is no good reason for an .immediate dissolution of the Union. ' It Is true that the territorial legislature of Kansas on .the iid of February, 1860, passed in great haste an act, Over the veto of the governor, declaring that slavery "is and shall be, forever .pro hibited in this Territory." Such an act, however, plainly Violating the rights of property secured by the Constitutionwill surely be. declared void by the judiciary, whenever it shall be presented in a legal form. . - . . Only three Says after my" Inauguration, the "Su preme Court of the United States solemnly adjudged that this power did not exist in a territorial legislature Yet such hasbeen the factious temper of the times that the correctness of this decision has been extensively impugned before'the people, and the'question has gir n rise toantrrfDoliticalconflictsthrouKhOutthecoun- trr. Those who have appealed from this Judgment y ... ..... . i, ' , . of our nignest constitutional iriounai io popular as semblies would, if they cOuW,- invest a territorial legislature ja ifl power to annul the sacred rights: of property.. 'This power CongVess'is expressly for bidden by the Federal Constitution to exercise. Every State Legislature in the Union is forbidden by its own constitution to exercise it ' It cannot be exercised in any State except by the people in their highest sovereign capacity when framing or amend ing their State consitution. In like manner, it can only bo exercised by the people of a Territory rep resented in "a convention of delegates for the pari pose of framing a constitution preparatory ad mission as a State into the Union. , Then, and not until then, are they invested with power to decide the question whether slavery shall rhall not exist within their limits This is an act of sovereign au thority, and not of, subordinate territorial legiehtton. Were'it otherwise, then indeed would the equality of the States in the Territories be destroyed, and the rights of property in slaves would depend, nut upon f h P-nariritfcs of the Constitutiin. but upon the shifting majorities of an irresponsible territorial leg islature. Such a ooctrinc, iroin us inirmsii; un soundness cannot long influence any considerable portion of our people, much less can it afford a good reason for a dissolution of the Union. ' The most palpable violations of constitutional duty which have yet been committed consist in the acts of different State legislatures to defeat the ex ecution of the fugitive slave law. It ought to be re membered, however, that for these acts neither Congress nor any President can justly be held re sponsible. Having beMi passed in violation of the Federal Constitution, tbey are therefore null and void. All the courts hoth State and national, le fore whom the question has arisen, have from the beginning declared the fugitive slave law to be con stitutional. The single exception is that of a Stato court in Wisconsin ; and this has not only leen re versed by the proper appellate tribunal, but has met with such universal reprobation that there can bo no danger from it as a precedent The validity of this law has been established over and over again by the Supreme Court of the United States with perfect unanimity. It is founded upon an express provision of the" Constitution, requiring that fugi tive slaves who escape from service in one State to another shall be "delivered up" to their masters. Without this provision it is a well known historical fact that the Constitution itself could never have leen adopted bv the Convention. In one form or other under the acts of 171)3 and 1850, both being substantially the same, the fugitive-slave law has been the law of the land from the days of Washing ton until the present moment Here, then, a clear case is presented, in which it will be the duty of the next President, as it has been my own, to act with vigor in executing this supreme law against the con flicting enactments of State legislatures. Should he fail in the performance of this high duty, he will then have manifested a disregard of the Constitu tion and laws to the great injury of the people of nearly one-half of the States of the Union. But are we to presume in advance that he will thus vio late his duty ! This would be at war with every principle of justice and of Christian charity, 1-et us wait for the OTer act The fugitive-slave law has lieen carried into execution in every contested case siiice the commencement of the present ndmir.istra tion ; though often it is to be rejrrettcd with great loss and inconvenience to the master, and with con siderable exuense to the overnmciit Let us trust j that the State legislatures will repeal their uncon i stitution and obnoxious enactments. Unless this ' shall Ins done without unnecessary delay, it is ira ' possible for any human power to save the Union. The Southern States standing on the basis of the Constitution, have a right to demand this act of jus tice from the States of the North. Should it be re fused, then the Constitution, to which all the States are parties, will have been wilfully violated by one portion of them in a provision essential to the do mestic security and happiness of the remainder. In that event, the injured States, after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress would be justified in revolutionary resist ance to the' Government of the Union. I have purposely confined my remarks to revolu tionary resistance, because it has been claimed with j in the last few years that any State, whenever this nuati w aw ow . I vigil aae - ittKui liiti J -v v- from the Union, in accordance with the Constitu tion, and without any violation of the constitutional rights of the other members of the Confederacy. That as each became parties to the Union by the vote of its own people assembled in Convention, so any one of them may retire from the Union in a sim ilar manner by the vote of such a convention. In order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy -it must be on the principle that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary association of States to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties. If this be so, the Confederacy is a rope ol sand, to be penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of tho States In this manner our thirty-three States may resolve themselves into as many petty, jarring, and hostile republics each one retiring from the Union, without responsibility, whenever any sudden excite ment might impel them to such a course. By 'this process a Union might be entirely broken into frag ments in a few weeks which cost our Inreftther many years of toil, privation, and blood to es tablish. Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the Federal Con stitution. After it was frami-d, with the irrcatcst ! I deliberation and care, it was submitted to conven- ! tions of the people of the several States for ratifica tion. Its provisions were discussed at length in these bodies, composed of the first men of the coun try. Its opponents contended that it conferred pow ers upon the Federal Government dangerous to the rights of the States whilst its advocates maintained that under a fair construction of the instrument there was no foundation for such apprehensions. In that mighty struggle between the first intellects of this or any other country, it never occurred to any individual, cither among its opponents or advocates, to assert, or even to intimate, that their efforts were all vain labor, because the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved she might secede from 1h" Union. What a crushing argument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the rights of the Stales would be endangered by the Constitution. The truth is that it was not until many years after the origin of the Federal Government that such a proposition was first advanced. It was then met and refuted by the conclusive arguments of General Jackson, who in his message of lUth January, 1833, transmitting the nullifying ordinance of South-Carolina to Congress employs the following language : " The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will, and without the consent of the other States, from their most solemn obligations and hazard the liberty and happiness of the millions composing- this Union, cannot be acknowledged. Such authority is believed to be utterly rcpugnnnt both to the principles upon which the General Gov eminent is constituted and to the objects which it was expressly formed to attain." - It .is not pretended that any clansc in the Consti tution gives countenance to such a theory. It is altogether founded upon inference not from any language contained in theinstrument itself, but from the sovereign people of the several States by which it was ratified. But is it beyond the power of a State, like an individual, to yield a portion of its sovereign rights to Becurc the remainder? In the language of Mr. Madison, who has been called tho father of the Constitution : " It was formed by the States that is by the people in each of the States acting in their highest sovereign capacity; and formed consequently by the same authority which formed the State constitutions." " Nor is the Government of the United States created by the Constitution, less a Government in the strict sense of the term, within the sphere of its powers than the governments created by the con stitution's of the States are, within their several spheres. Jt is like them, organized into legislative, executive, and judiciary, departments. It operates, like them, directly on persons and things ; and, like them, it has at command a physical force for execu ting the powers committed to it" It was intended to be perpetual, and not to be an nulled at the pleasure of any one of the contracting parties. The old articles of confederation were en titled "Articles, of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States;? and by the 18th article it is expressly declared that "the articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual." The pre . amble to the Constitution of the United States, hav Tng: Vxprcsseference to fKe" aBScW.of "Uonfedera-1 tionj recites that it was established 'in order to ? form a tnore perfect union." And yet it is contended that that this; '.' nonr perfect union does not inr " elude the essential attribute of perpetuity. .J - :.But that this Union -was designed to be perpetual appears conclusively from the nature and extent of the powers conferred by the Constitution on the Federal Government These powers embrace the very highest atributes' of national sovereignty. They place both the sword and purse under its con trol Congre haa power to make war, (and" to make peace ; to ris6 arid support armies and navies and to conclude treaties with- foreign governments. ' It is invested -with-the power to -coin money, and to regulate the value thereof, and to regulate com merce with foreign nations,-and among the several States. It is not necessary to enumerate the other high powers which havo- been' conferred upon the Federal Government In order to carry tho enume rated powers into effect, Congress possesses the ex clusive right to lay and collect duties, on imports, and in coin moo with, the States to lay and collect all -other taxes. But the Constitution has not only conferred those high powers upon Congress, but it has adopted ef fectual means to restrain the States from interfering with their exercise. For that purpose it has in strong prohibitory language,' expressly declared that " no State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin morey ; emit bills of credit ; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, exposlfurto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts." More over, without the consent of Congress, no State shall lay any imposts or duties on any imports or exports except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws ; " and, if they exceed this amount, the excess shall belong to the United States. And "no State shall, without the consent of Con gress lay any duty of tonnage ; keep troops, or ships of war, in timo of peace ; enter into any agreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign power ; or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay." In order still further to secure tho uninterrupted exercise of these high powers against Stte interpo sition, it is provided "that this Constitution and the laws of the United Suites which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." The solemn sanction of religion has been super added to the obligations of official duty, and all sen ators and representatives of the United States, all members of State legislatures and all executive and judicial officers, "both of the United States and of the several States, shall be Iwund by oath or affirm ation to support this Constitution." In order to carry into effect these powers, the Constitution has established a perfect government in all its forms. Legislative, Executive, and Judicial; and this government, to tl! extent of its powers acts directly upon the individual citizens of every State, and executes its own decrees by the agency of its own officers. Li this respect it differs entire ly from the government under the old confederation, which was confined in making requisitions on the States in their sovereign character. This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse, and they often declined to comply with such requi sitions. It thus became necessary, for the purpose of removing this barrier, and "in order to form a more perfect Union," to establish a government which could act directly upon the people, and exe cute its own laws without the intermediate agency of the States. This has been accomplished by the Constitution of the United States. In short, the government created by tho Consti tution, and deriving its authority fiom the sovereign people of each of the several States has precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these States n the enumerated cases, that each one of thcni possesses over suhjocts not dele gated to the United States but "reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people." To the extent of the delegated powers the Consti tution of the United States is as m;:ch a part of the constitution of each State, and is as binding upon its people, as though it had been textu&lly inserted therein. This government, therefore, is a great and power ful government, invested with all the attributes of soveieignty over the special subjects to which its authority extends. Its franiers never intended to implant in its bosom the seeds of its own destruc tion, nor were they at its creation guilty of the ab surdity of providing for its own dissolution. It was not intended by its framers to be the baseless fabric of a vision which, at the touch of the enchanter, would vanish into thin air, but a substantial and mighty fabric, capable of resisting the slow decay of time and of defying the Storms of ages. Indeed, well may the jealous patriots of that day have in dulged fears that a government of such hii;h powers might violate the reserved rights of the States and wisely did they adopt the rule of a strict construc tion of these powers to prevent the danger! But th. y did not fear, nor had they any reason to imag ine, that tho Constitution would ever be so inter preted as to enable any State, hy her own act. and without the consent of her sister States, to discharge her people from all or any of their federal obligations. It may be asked, then, are the people of the States without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the Federal Government 7 By no means. The right of resistance on the part of the governed against the oppression of their governments cannot be denied. It exists independently of all constitutions and has leen exercised at all periods of the world's history. Under it old governments have been destroyed, and new ones have taken their place. It is embodied in strong and express language in our declaration of Independence. But the distinction must ever be observed, that this is revolution against an estab lished Government, and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of an inherent constitutional right. In short, let us look the danger fairly in the face: Scce-sion is neither more nor less than revolution. It may or it may not be a justifiable revolution, but still it is revolution. What, in the mean time, is the responsibility and true position of the Executive? He is bound by solemn oath before God and the country "to take care that the laws be faithfully executed," and from this obligation he cannot be absolved hy any human power. But what if the performance of this duty, in whole or in part, has been rendered impractica ble by events over which .he could have exercised no control? Such, at the present moment, is the cise throughout the Stute of South-Carolina, so far as the laws of the UnitctTSUtps to secure the adminis tration of justice by means of the Federal Judiciary arc concerned. AH the Federal officers within its limits, through whose agency alone these laws can be carried into execution, have already resigned. AVe no longer have a district judge, a district attor ney, or a marshal, in South-Carolina. In-.facf, the whole machinery of the Federal Government, neces sary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people, has been demolished ; and it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace it The only acts of Congress on the statute-book, bearing upon this subject, are those of the 28th Feb ruary, 1795, and 8d March, 1807. These authorize the President, after he shall have ascertained that - the marshall with his potse eomitatut is unablo to execute civ 4 or criminal process in any particular case, to' call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid him in performing this service, hav ing first by Proclamation commanded the insurgents " to disperse and retire peaceably to their respect ive abodes' within a limited time." This duty can not by possibiliy be performed in a State where no judicial authority exists to issue process, and where there is no marshal to execute it, and where, even if there were such an officer, the entire population would constituc one solid combination to resist him. The bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they arc without further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single State, not to speak of other States who may place them selves in a similar attitude. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out more effectu ally the objects of the Constitution. . The same, insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way of executing the laws for the collection of the customs. The revenue still continues to be collect ed, as heretofore, at the custom-house in Charleston ; and should the collector unfortunately resign, a suc cessor may be appointed to perform this duty.

It bears no re semblance to the recognition of a foreign de facta. government, involving no such responsibility.. Any attempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation. It is therclore, my duty to sub mit to Congress the whole question in all its bear ings. The course of events is so rapidly hastening forward, that the emergency may soon arise, when you may be called upon to decide tho momentous nuestion whether you possess the power, by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union. I i-honld feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to express an opinion on this important subject The question fairly stated is: .Has the Constitu tion delegated to Congress tlw power to coerce a State into submission' which is attempting to with draw or has actually withdrawn from the Confeder acy ? If answered in the affirmative, it must be on tho principle that the power has been conferred up- J on Congress to declare ana to traite war against a Stat". After much serious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been dele gated to Congress or to any other department of the federal government. It is manifest, upon an inspec tion of the Constitution, that this is not among the specific and enumerated powers granted to Congress; audit is equally apparent that its exercise is not " necessary and proper for carrying into execution" any one of these powers. So far from this power having been delegated to Congress it was expressly refused by the convention which framed the Consti tution. It appears from the proceedings of that body, that on the 31st May, 1787. the clause "authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole against a delin quent State" .came up for consideration. Mr. Madi son nposed it in a brief but powerful speech, from which I stall extract but a single sentence. He ob served : " The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an inflic tion of punishment; and would probably be consid ered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bnund." Upon his motion the clause was unanimously post poned, and was never I believe, again presented. Soon afterwards on the 8th June, 1787, when inci dentally adverting to the subject, he said : " Any Government for the United States formed on the supposed practicability of using force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the States, would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of Congress," evidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confederation. Without descending to particulars it may be safe ly asserted, that the powcrto make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the Constitution. Suppose such a war should re sult in the conquest of a State, how are wc to gov ern it afterwards ? Shall we hold it as a province, and govern it by despotic power ? In the nature of things we could not, by physical force, control the will of the people, and compel them to elect sena tors and representatives to Congress and to perform all the other duties depending upon their own voli tion, and required from the free citizens of a free State as a constituent member of the Confederacy. But, if we possessed this power, would it be wjse to exercise it under existing- circumstances ? The object would doubtless be to preserve the Union. War would not only present tho most effectual means of destroying it, but would banish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction. Besides in the frater nal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expended, rendering future reconciliation between the States impossible. In the mean time, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and privations of the people during its existence? The fact is that our Union rests upon public opin ion, and ran never be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it cannot live in the affections of the people, it must one day perish. Conjrress possess many means of preserving it by conciliation ; but the sword was not placed in their hand to preserve it by force. But may I be permitted to invoke my country men to pause and deliberate, before they determine to destroy this, the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world begnn? It has been consecrated by tho blood of our fathers by the glories of the past, and by the hopes of the future. The Union has already made us the most prosperous and ere long, will, if pre served render us the most powerful nation on the face of the earth. In every foreign region of the globe the title of American citizen is held in the highest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest pride. Surely when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss' we shall recoil with horror from the last fit d plunge. By such a dread catas trophe tho hopes of the friends of freedom through out the worll would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden despotism would enshroud the nations. Our example for more than eighty years would not only be lost ; but it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man is unfit for self-government. It is not every wrong nay. it is not every grievous wrong which can justify a resort to such a fearful alternative. This ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other constitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted. We should reflect that under this free Government there is an incessant ebb and flow in public opinion. The slavery question, like every thing human, will have its day I firmly believe that it has already reached and passed the culmi nating point. But if, in the midst of the existing excitement, the Union shall perish, the evil may then becomo irreparable. Congress can contribute much to avert it by proposing and recommending to the lsgislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils which the Constitution has itself provided for its own preservation. This has been tried at different critical periods of our history, and always with eminent success. It is to be found in the 5th article providing for its own amendment Under this article amendments have been proposed hy two-thirds of both houses of Congress, and have been " ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of tho several States' and haveconseqiiently become parts of tho Constitution. To this process the country is indebted for the clause prohibiting Con gress from passing any law respecting an establish ment of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or of the right of petition. To this we are, also, indebted for the Bill of Rights which secures the people against any abuse of power by the Federal Government Such were the apprehen sions justly entertained by the friends of State Rights at that period as to have . rendered it ex tremely doubtful whether the Convention could bave long snrvivod without those amendments. Again, the Constitution was amended by the same process after the election of President Jefferson by the House of Representative, in February, 1803. This amendment was rendered necessary to prevent a recurrence of the dangers which had seriously threatened the existence of the Government during the pendency of that election. The article for its own amendment was intended to secure the amicable adjustment of conflicting constitutional questions like the present, which might ariso between the governments of the States and that of the United States. This appears from cotemporancous history. In this connection, I shall merely call attention to a few sentences in Mr, ' Maidson s justly celebrated report, in 1790, to the legislature of Virginia. In this he ably and conclusively defended the resolu tions of the preceding legislatures against the stric tures of several other Slate legislatures. These were mainly founded upon the protest of the Vir ginia legislature against the "Alien and Sedition Acts," as ' palpable and alarming infactions of the Constitution." In pointing out the peaceful and constitutional - remedies' and.-he referred" to "none other, id which the States were authorized to resort on uch occasions' he -concludes by saying, - that the legislatures pf the States ftaignt havenade direct representation to Congress with a .Vlsw- to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive acts, or tbey might have represented "to their respective senators in Congress their wish that two thirds thereof would propose an explanatory amendment to the Constitu tion, or two-thirds of themselves, if such bad been their option, might, by an application to Congress, have obtained a convention for the same object" ,' This is the very-- course which I earnestly recom mend in order to obtain an "explanatory amend ment" of the Constitution on the subject of slavery. This might originate with Congress or the State, legislatures as may be deemed, most advisable to attain the object. . . - . : The explanatory amendment might be confined to the final settlement of the true construction of the Constitution on threo special points : ' : ; 1. An express recognition of the' right of prop erty in slaves in the States where it now exists or may hereafter exist . 2. The duty of protecting this right in all the common Territories throughout their territorial ex istence, and until they shall be admitted as States into the Union, with or without slavery, as their constitutions may prescribe. .' . . 3. A like recognition of the right of the mister to have his' slave, who has escaped from one State to another, restored and "delivered np" to-him, and of the validity of the fugitive-slave law enacted for this purpose, together with a declaration that all State laws impairing or defeating this right are vio lations of the Constitution, and are consequently null and void. . . - It may be objected that this construction of the Constitution has already been settled by the Su premo Court of the United States and what more ought to be required? - The answer is that a very large proportion of the people of the United States still contest the correctness of this decision, and never will cease from agitation and admit its bind ing force until clearly established by the people of the Heveral States in their sovereign character. Such an explanatory amendment would, it is believed, forever terminate the existing dissensions and re store peace and harmony among the States. . It ought not to be doubted that such an appeal to the arbitrament established by the Constitution itself would be received with ftvor by all the States of the Confederacy. In any event it ought to be tried in a spirit of conciliation before any of these States shall separate themselves from the Union. When I entered upon the. duties of the Presiden tial office, the aspect neither 01 our foreign nor do mestic affairs was at all satisfactory. We were in volved in dangerous complications with several na tions, and two of our Territories were in a state of revolution against the Government A restoration of the African slave trade had numerous and power ful advocates.' Unlawful military expeditions were countenanced by many of our citizens and were suf fered, in defiance of the efforts of the Government, to escape from our shores for the purpose of making war upon the unoffending people of neighboring re publics with whom we were at peace. In addition to these and other difficulties we experienced a re vulsion in monetary affairs soon after my advent to power, of unexampled severity and of ruinous con sequences to all the great interest of the country. -When we take a retrospect of what was then our condition and contrast this with its material pros perity at the time of the late Presidential election, we have abundant reason to return our grateful thanks to that merciful Providence which has never forsaken us as a nation in all our past trials. 

JAMES BUCHANAN. 'Washington, Dec. 3, 1860. LEGISLATURE OF NORTH-CAROLINA. SENATE. Thursday, Dec. 6, 1860. The Senate was called to order at 11 o'clock. Prayer by Rer. T. E. Skinner. The Journal of Wednesday was read and ap proved Mr. Harriss of Chatham, presented a memorial from the Cape Fear and Deep River Navigation Com pany, which wa3 ordered to be read During the reading, Mr. Outlaw moved that the further reading of the memorial be dispensed with, and that it be referred to the committee on claims. Carried Mr. Shaw moved to print Not concurred in. Mr. Blount presented a series of resolutions passed by citizens of Pitt count', declaring that sufficient cause existed for North Carolina -to dissolve the bands which unite her to the federal government, and urging the arming of the State forthwith. Re ferred to the committee on federal relations. A message was received from the House stating, that that body had concurred in the proposition of the Senate to print the communication from the Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherford Railroad Mr. Faison from the committee on the election of Enjrrossing Clerk, yesterday, reported as follows: Whole number of votes cast 149, necessary to a choice 71. Mr. Futral received 43 votes, Mr. Vail S8 votes. Mr. Worth from the committee on the election of State Treasurer, reported that Mr. Courts bad re ceived 146 votes, the whole number cast, and was unanimously elected Mr. Street presented a memorial from K. H. Lewis and W. II. Lewis of the county of Craven. Read and on motion of Mr. Street, transmitted to the House. Mr. Ramsay presented a memorial from and pro ceedings of a meeting of the citizens of Rowan county, in favor of calling a Convention of the State, and favoring secession. Mr. Ramsay said that this memorial emanated from a highly respectable portion of his constituents, but he would state that he did not believe that it reflected the sentiments of the majority in his section, and thought it proper to state that he dif fered with the memorialists very materially, but would defer further remarks on the question to a future time. Mr. Avery presented a series of resolutions of the same character from a portion of his constituents who had met without regard to party. Mr. Brown arose and said that he would take this opportunity of expressing his views on the subject matter of these resolutions which were being from time to time introduced and which it was likely would be considered abroad the voice of a majority in the State, when it was his opinion that nine of eve ry ten of the people of the State were opposed to a dissolution of the Union for existing causes He had a high respect for the inestimable right of peti tion, anJ wished it distinctly understood that be believed the memorialists were influenced by noble and patriotic motives but that they were too hasty. In some things he agreed with them, in others he differed Mr. B. said that he had been among his constituents during the past few days and they were opposed to such hasty action that the people of Caswell were in favor of imitating the glorious example of onr rev olutionary sires in deliberating on these questions with calmness and a lofty purpose of mind, of demand ing their rights in the Union, and guarantees for the protection of their property from the North before venturing to dissolve that glorious compact framed by our fathers. ' Mr. Brown said that the Southern States should confer solemnly together on this all important subject, as the same lot of weal or wo would fall on them all alike in case of their secession that North-Carolina should be consulted, and that no State should secede without this common consults-' tion that they should together demand theif rights and in the event of failure to obtain them act to gether as brethren. Gentlemen who had supported Mr. Breckinridge during the late campaign had not only said they were not advocating disunion, and that the election of Lincoln was not sufficient cause for disunion, but had repelled the charge as an in famous' slander. He had not heard one of them say that the election of Lincoln was sufficient cause for a dissolution of the Union before the election ; but on Wednesday evening had heard doctrines avowed in a meeting in the Commons Hall, by an Elector, certainly not avowed during the canvass. If it had been generally so avowed and believed, he did not believe the Breckinridge ticket would have received 20,000 votes in North-Carolina. What right, asked Mr. B., have we to march to victory under nne flag, and in the moment of a tri umph to raise one entirely different ? Was this good faith to the people? His own opinion was that mere popular election was no cause for dissolution that the proper mode would be to demand guaran tees for the protection of our property, and that our 1 rights. fcfc properly recognized,' and if Lincoln in. fringes the Constitution in one single instance, or attempts to use' authority not granted hfro by that Constitution, then,' said he- let the South rise in her might and majesty and expel the tyrant from nis'throneC - Mr.; Breckinridge bad been charted with disunion proclivities. . ; -Mr, B. read from the Lexington SlaUtman the opinions of Mr, Breckinridge expressed a few dayg since declaring against dismilpn for existing causes and said the opinions of our- noble standard-bearer were entitled to.Tespec.t..', If. be,..Mr. Brown, had believed these charges no man would have dropped bim sooner than he would.- Mr. Breckinridge had denied it be did not tbink the election of Lincoln sufficient cause for a dissolution of the Union. Mr B thought that the opi onions of Mr. Breckinridge should be entitled to! respect should be heeded by the party of which he was the acknowledged leader in the late election." .) '- :' !. Mr. B,aid that it was nnjust. that citizens who would not fall in with hot baste into the ranks of se cession should be branded as submissionists ; that he was emphatically " a State's-rights man had never fought under, any other banner, and that the word submission was not in his political vocabulary. The secession of one State did not necessarily make it wise or expedient for other . Southern States to ea with her.: 6 ' Mr. Brown further said, that he believed that Massachusetts and Vermont were more loyal in feel. Sng to the government of Great Brittain than to the United States, and their secession would be consid ered by him as anything else than a calamity. He was not for that recreant submission that would surren der the federal government to the bidding of Wcndall Phillips, Garri Km, Massachusetts & the British crew It was more valiant to fight them awhile in the Union. The statutes of the federal government, protectin slavery were stronger he said to-day than ever before! The opposition to Republicanism has a large majori ty in the two Houses of Congress and is likely t0 have fur years to come. - The Supreme Court is on the side of the South. ' " Mr. B. concluded by saying that he did not believe that there was one In forty in the State in favor of secession without first having made a demand for guarantees from the North. Mr. Avery next addressed the Senate, He regret ted that Mr. Brown should have taken this occasion to indulge in denunciatory terms of the memorial from his constituents and of. those who entertained the views set forth in that memorial. (Mr. Brown here said that he had expressed him self as not wishing to impugn the patriotic motives of Mr. Avery's constituents.) . Mr. Avery continued : That his constituents had exercised a right in making the requests they had in the memorial, which they had done respectfully, and that they were denounced with those who thought with them as disunionists, and ready to break up the Union for a slight cause. Mr. Avery said that if Mr. Brown had not said that the election of Lincoln was a sufficient cause for a dissolution of the Union, that he had declared that his election would bring it about that in that case it was inevitable. Mr. Avery further said, he had never in the cam paign raised the curtain and contemplated disunion, but that if it was necessary he would stand up to it as a man and a North-Carolinian that the mere election of a President was no cause for dissolution, but the election of a sectional candidate on the plat form of principles as laid down by the Republican party, was when coupled with the continued ag gression of that party on the rights of the South. The President could not be taken out of his position while we remain in . the Union. The North will never give any guarantees and if we go into Con vention with them, they will bind the South hand and foot He had been a bitter partizan, but believed the time had come when party distinctions should be torn asunder that there was no half-way ground, that North-Carolina would say to all who are not for me you are against me. The extreme Southern States do not wish to confer and conspire with the border States against the Union, they will first leave it and bear your suggestions. The Senator will waitforan overt act What is that act ? It will never be de fined, and it will never be admitted that it is commit ted by those gentlemen who call themselves Unionists. Mr. Avery said that' Mr." Brown was as much a disunionist as himself that the difference between them was a mere question of-time. Mr. Avery thought if the advocates of Mr. Breckinridge had ad vocated disunion, that the .State" would have gone for him by 20,000 majority ; that the people were far in advance of the politicians on this question.--Caswell was a State's rights county, and the first gun fired by federal troops to coerce South-Carolina would bring her people into the field Mr. Avery said he would abide the decision of the State as a loyal citizen, whatever his own opinions might be. : Mr. Brown again addressed the Senate. He spoke in high terms of the message of the President, and said he.was proud that Mr. Buchanan bad taken the position he had - Mr. Avery replied, and the debate was continued until 3 o'clock, when Mr. Thomas of Jackson, said he had no doubt that both the gentlemen were patriots and friends to a Constitutional Union, and moved to adjourn. The Senate then adjourned toll o'clock Friday.
