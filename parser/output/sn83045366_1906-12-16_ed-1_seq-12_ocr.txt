1 Editorial Section By James Gray. THEf empire of rolling prairie west Minnesota, known geograph ically as North Dakota, has for seventeen. years been known S[erchants' olitically as the property of the hotel gang." Year after year the people of North Dakota have seen their state officers and their legislators nominated in a McKenzie caucus in St. Paul, and haw tamelv accepted the results of those labors at their nominating conventions and elections. With few exceptions this has been the case. McKenzie al ways attended to this business except when he was in Alaska or detained at Alameda, Cal. One might argue from this that the people of North Dakota were a tame lot who did not get self-government be cause they did not deserve it. The contrary is the case. The state is built up of the vigorous young man hood and womanhood of the union. It fathers to itself the youthful, the am itious, the capable fnembers of the communities of two hemispheres. The conditions which produced bossism were such that while they excited the hatred of the whole people, they were able to submerge that distrust. The factors producing those conditions were railroads. Eailroads always have been frankly and brutally in politics in North Dakota. Moreover, they had the mastery of the people, as the lay out of the railroad lines easily shows. Take a map of North Dakota and you will see that the railroads are great trunk lines gridironing the state irom east to west at intervals. Until re cent years cross lines north and south have been few. This meant that the people could communicate with one an other with insufficient freedom. The railroads had but to control opinion along their trunk lines and bring poli ticians of the south trunk lines to gether with the politicians on the north trunk lines, tell each in advance what the other section had agreed to do and the trick was turned. It was a case of hoodman blind. The people of the north never found the people, their brethren of the south, until recently. But when they came together, it was a case of love at first sight. Last November there was an engagement on the first Tuesday in January there will be a wedding. A Battle for Home Rule. The battle of the ballots in North Dakota, divested of all its minor effects, was one of home rule. The victory of the democratic ticket was not one of partizan politics, but a victory of the people. It was a joint movement of the democrats and* in surgent republicans to regain title to. their own property. That this is the proper construction to place upon it, is vouched for such men as Governor elect Burke, Senator Cashel, the mana ger of his campaign, and others com petent to give an opinion. The republican state convention was held on the 12th of July. It was pre ceded by the customary meeting at the" Merchants hotel in St. Paul? That meeting made the customary slate of nominees and those nominees were en dorsed by the delegates as usu8ft.: The customary passes were issued to the delegates who were to go to James townbut not to all. The insurgent republicans were not honored. They were practically invited to pay their fare or stay at home. Like Jonah, "they paid their fare and went.'' When thev arrived, they found the usual state of affairs as to the state ticket, but with an additional wrinkle. McKenzie was there as a full-panoplied delegate working upon the floor. This was such an unheard-of attitude of the boss that it caused inquiry. Inquiry developed that the boss was perturbed. The perturbation was occasioned by the situation as to the supreme court. To learn about that, it is necessary to go back a little. Judge Young, of the supreme court, had decided to re sign in time for the republican con vention to nominate a successor for the four years of his term. Judge Young had been a splendid members of the bench and his retirement to return to practice caused universal regret. But the lawyers, knowing his intention to be irrevocable, turned to the future. Who was to have the nomination? I They looke upd the "leaders" of the organizatiod an made practically this statement to McKenzie and others: "The politicians have never inter fered with the bench. While the judges have generally been republicans, they have been always selected for their fitness. We want assurance that you will name a good lawyer and clean cut citizen for this vacancy." The promise was given them. The convention came on and this situation developed: The leaders were short of votes for their slate. Some trading was necessary and the proposal was to trade the supreme court nomination to John Knauff, of Jamestown, in ex change for the delegation from his judicial district (the fifth). It was a most audacious scheme and threw to the winds all the promises made to the bar. There was an instant protest by wire. The lawyers got back the cold message that it was "too late." The deal was fixed and had to go thru. This was the starting point of the war which resulted in the first overthrow of the republican party in North Dakota since 1892. Correspondence of The Journal. Ottawa, Ont., Dec. 13.As was ex pected, the labor unions in eastern Canada are passing indignant resolu tions against Earl Grey, on account of his recent statement in Toronto that what Canada needed most was an abun dance of cheap labor. There seems to be a general misap prehension among labor men, that the governor general contemplated the in troduction into the country of labor that would come into competition with Canadian labor. But as Ralph Smith, M.P., former ex-president of the Do minion Trades and Labor Congress, Soints out in an interview, Earl Grey as in view the importation of cheap, unskilled labor for railway construc tion, charing land and generally the rough part of industrial development and this kind of labor does not conflict Js&rWsAi ^-i'^^M^k LAURIER TARIFF POLICY JOLTS MANUFACTURERS Government Is Standing by Its Guns and Seems to Have the Popular Approval of the CountryPresi dent's Message Read Across the Border. The renomination of Governor Sarles contributed its quota to the disturbed condition. It is difficult even now to get a fairly satisfactory characteriza tion of Governor Sarles from his own people. Some will tell you that his defeat was due, not to himself, but to the gang. Others will tell you with equal emphasis that he was too heavy a load on the organization. Some say he has made a great business governor, has improved the methods of doing business and was not judged upon his administration, but on personal charac teristics, not necessarily related to his honesty or ability. Others declare that his administration carried him down, that the capitol job which he approved and which the supreme court threw put made his defeat imperative, that his personal habits might have been for given if there were not graver- blem- ishes on him as a public servant. This much is admitted by all, that Sarles was a product of the "system," that he got his first nomination from the Merchants hotel junta and that he never did anything for the state of North Dakota to differentiate him from the ordinary routine governor. He seized none of the opportunities which come to an executive to probe the state institutions, nor to wake up the state railroad commission to its duties, nor to give a bad quarter of an hour to a somnolent state board of equalization. The situation at the close of the convention was that there were mutter ings of discontent all over the' state. The bosses heard them, but laughed them off. The insurgents, they were assured, would not bolt the democrats were innocuous the lawyers would not make any headway in their fight, be cause the people would not hear law yers. Sarles, in 1904, had carried every county in the state and had a total of 32,000 majority in a vote of about 64,000. Here was a safe margin on which to gamble. So McKenzie went into the campaign, corklike and unsunk. He had seen blacker squalls pass over before. John Burke Is Named. But the democrats were not innoc uous. They had a man, in fact they had two men, one with the brains and the heart which appeal, another with the brains and tenacity which organize. They named John Burke for^governor and Senator Cashel to manage the cam paign. At the democratic convention at Minot every delegate paid his way and went down to nominate John Burke. John Burke also paid his way and went down to Minot to prevent, if he could, John Burke's nomination. "When I got down there," he said, I found I could neither head it off nor could I get out of the way. I had been trying to keep out of politics. I had built up a good law practice and I was interested in my work. When this nomination came upon me, I was to some extent out of touch with affairs and had to look them up again." Mr. Bnxkje evidently looked things up to good effect, as when the votes were counted, he,, had made,a change of 37,000 .from the vote of the previous election. From a minority of 32,000 the democrats had become a maioritv of 5,000 in the state. Three Railroad Facts. It was done simply by calling the attention of the people to some racts. First, that the state of North Dakota had a state railroad commission em powered by law to fix maximum freight and passenger rates and that this com mission never fixed anything but its person in easy chairs. Only one at tempt had been made, under the admin istration of Attorney General Cowan, and this had winked out somewhere in the federal courts in the year of our Lord 1898. Second, that North Dakota had a law was tha^ the* ^ailroll with the interests of any Canadian union. Manufacturers and the Tariff. Canadian manufacturers seem to have been taken by surprise as to the na ture of the government's new tariff policy or if they were not, they are cleverly creating that impression, for reasons best known to themselves. In any case, they have not by any means thrown up the sponge.] Deputation after deputation, repre senting one or other of the great in dustries of the country, crowds the lobbies of the house of commons- and the usually suave features of the' min ister of finance today wears a worried look, as of one who is fencing for wind with a weighty antagonist. It is safe to say^ however, that the fas oyernment will stick to its guns. It been made pretty clear, since the tariff policy was announced in parlia- y^^^s^^ihj^^''M^m^^^.^^is^$^!i regulating carrying charges on lignite coal, an important local product and by many considered the key to the fuel question, which had been brazenly ig nored by the railroads. The use of lignite had been discontinued, because the people could not get it. One con cern, the Central Heating & Lighting Plant of Fargo, told me that 4t burned 10,000 tons of lignite annually for three years, but now was burning none because the carrying charges on the 200 miles from Bismarck to Fargo were Prohibitive, while lignite was carried to Minneapolis at reasonable rates, lhe only reason given was that to .bargo it was a one-way haul and meant a return of empties." But this would hardly bftvce excused the rail road from its legal dutiesrailroads reason .was tha thetheir Ifi'SSS 2 state commission1 as.s,e88itn the at let the railroads as they pleased. Ihird the state board ofequaliza iQ0nnWa,S udo f0 $6,500 for branches and $1,500 a mile Montana, was valuing main line at $16,000 a mile. In addition, it was shown in the campaign that the rail roads were assessed about 12y? per cent ot their real valuation, while other classes of property together averaged 66 per cent. A Wonderful Campaign. These were the economic questions advanced, and ..they greatly interested ment, that the country approves of its main features. The western farmer just now bulks large in the eyes of the Canadian public. He is making the country rich he is bringing population in at a rate undreamed of a decade ago and he has done more than .any other single class of the community to give Canada an assured position in the commercial world. Self-interest, as well as gratitude, compel the rest of the population to concede at least such a reasonable measure of relief to the western farmer as is embodied in the new tariff. Standing in Their Own Light. The manufacturer will have to strug gle along as best he may and there is a shrewd suspicion that he can' make both ends meet even with such protec tion as he has as present. As a matter of fact, Canadian manufacturers have had their eyes glued to a telescope, scanning the horizon for openings in foreign markets, and all the time have practically ignored the splendid and rapidly increasing prospects of theirs own west. As a result any sympathy western Canadians might $ave felt for the de mands"of the eastern manufacturer has been wiped out. When the merchants of Winnipeg, Eegina, Calgary or Ed monton, the farmers of Saskatchewan and Alberta find that they can not only^ get goods quicker and in many cases cheaper in Minneapolis or Chi cago than in TorontBb and Montreal and" besidesand this is the serious point for the Canadian manufacturer- tM$l& MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 16, 1906.

On th)e last Monday-of the campaign he went up the farmers' railroad from Devils Lake,-where he lives, toward the country he had' so often stumped for the senate and jnade ten speeches, each of which was heard by hundreds of farmers, wh'oidroVe in from miles on on either side of *$e road.

These are but a few of the main points thrown off by Mr. Burke in con versation. He is expected by his friends to address a strong message to the legislature and to wield a strong influence for good during the next two years. Some Burke Characteristics. Opinions differ about Governor-elect Burke, as they do about Governor Sarles. You will hear on the one hand that he is not much of a reformer, that Jud La Moure things he is a good fellow, as if this was enough to damn a man that he will be a good business gov ernor, but that he will not run amuck. The opposite view, which is one justi fied by his rise in politics, is that he has been brought up in a school which makes character, and that while he will be slow to start a fight until he is sure of his ground, he will be a bulldog for tenacity when the struggle comes. Governor John Burke is 47 years old. He has been in North Dakota eighteen years and practiced law in all her courts. He has never had anything but a general practice, and the testf mony or attorneys who have met him is that he is perfectly square as a law yer and a man. He used to be called ''The Lincoln of North Dakota," but Burke stopped that by saying: "Nothing'makes me feel so mean as to be called the Lincoln of North Dakota. It is a sacrilege to call any man a Lincoln. There never was but one. Please don't. say that any more." Likewise he frowned down the nick name of "Honest John." "It is cant," he said..i I am as honest as I know how to be, and at that I am no more honest than thousands of others. I don't like to be called something which seems to set me out as claiming a special brand of honor among my fellows." find the western American manufac turer more anxioTJs to meet their needs than their own countrymen in the east, they naturally feel that the time has come tp look after their own interests and let the eastern manufacturer shift for himself. A Tempest in a Teapot. The action of W. L. Mackenzie-King, Canada's deputy minister of labor, in going to Indianapolis to secure the ap proval of Mr. Mitchell of the settle ment of the coal strike at Lethbridge, created for a time much irritation. It was felt* that a Canadian official should not have gone out of the country to settle a purely domestic affair. Mr. Mackenzie-King's plucky defence of his action, however, swung' public opinion around to the more common-sense view. The situation was desperate the peo ple of western Canada were freezing for want of coal, and it was no time to stand upon official dignity. The shortest road to a settlement was the only one to follow. Canada's Official Peacemaker. Mr. Mackenzie King is one of the most brilliant members of the younger group of officials at Ottawa. He was graduated from Harvard some years ago, capturing a traveling scholarship. While in Europe he got two cables, within a day or two of each other. One offered- him a lectureship at Har vard. The other, from the Canadian government, offered him the important post, just then created, of deputy min ister of labor. The Harvard leoture- So he has been thru all his life thoroly democratic. And besides being democratic, he is a democrat. When Burke reached North Dakota eighteen years ago, he went up into the northern portion of the state, to Cando first, and then to Eolla to live. To this uegion had pre brought their democracy with them and they ruled tharegioju Jjohn Burke was. their young hero. He went to the legislature, first to the house and then to the senate. But immigration kept pouring in and it was not from Mis souri. It was from Norway, and the men from Norway were republicans. The Missourians woke up one day to find that they were in the minority. ^CoUitT, WHLO 1Q3KE ship was tempting, but to a man of Mr. Mackenzie-King's active temperament, the prospects held out by the new post at Ottawa proved more alluring. The Canadian government never maae a better appointment. Since his appointment, Mr. Macken zie-King has by the sheer force of his own personality, by his shrewd com mon sense, his knowledge of human na ture, and the democratic way in which he approached all parties, done more to settle disputes between labor and employer than the old-fashioned offi cials ever dreamed possible. /His success has been largely due to the fact that he has earned' the trust and sympathy of the better elements on both sides. Both the employers and the unions know by experience that he can be counted on to take a just and impartial View of- the questions that so often divide them. He comes by his character honestly, for he is a di rect descendant, of the famous leader of the upper Canadian rebellion, Wil liam Lyon Mackenzie, who fought the great battle of self-government. Message Thru Canadian Eyes. So many points in President Boose velt's message touch problems that are common to both countries, that it has been read with almost as much interest in Canada as in the United States The evils of over-capitalization exist in Canada as well as across the line, tho of course on a very much smaller scale. In Canada the government already has to some extent the control over indus trial corporations advocated by th Towner county was no longer theirs. But John Burke continued to go to the legislature, because the Norwegians were not a whit behind the Missourians in admiration of the tall, .engaging young Irishman with the captivating smile and sympathetic .dispositions in time, the Missourians became only his eded Mm. a band of" Missourians ,y? hQ JIyjng_sjgmdron, .while the new immi-1 grants were his main fleet. Burke is a good talker, extraordinarily successful man juries and has done much court work murder cases, representing sometimes, the state and sometimes the defense. In either event he has been always a power with the juries, who believed implicity in his candor. He is a good "mixer" also, and, while very quiet in 3oV.BttR.IC

Such institutions in Canada are compelled by law to make returns to the government .showing the extent of their capitalization, etc. The diffi cult question of subsidiary corporations is now being investigated by a com mission which is expected to make cer tain-radical recommendations to the government. The question of bank circulation is now before the dominion government. The difficulty here, however, is not so much the need for an increase in bills of small denominations, as in a freer circulation of the larger bills. President Roosevelt's recommenda tion in connection with the packing house inspection law that the label be dated and that the cost of inspection be charged to the packers, meets with the cordial approval of Canadian gov ernment inspectors, who are advocating similar measures in the dominion. Where Canada Leads. So far as the president's recommen dations as to the national target ranges and rifles clubs, are concerned, Canada is 'i-ather in advance of the United States. The dominion has already spent many hundred ^"thousands of dollars on rifle ranges, from the Atlantic to the. Pacific it encourages independent rifle clubs as well as regimental shooting in the militia and. there is today hardly a town of any size in the country that does not maintain one or more cadet corps in connection with its public schools.

Senator Cashel, the Organizer. The organizing brains were those of Senator J. L. Cashel of Grafton. Sena tor Cashel is a product of political evo lution. He appears in the second and third .sessions of the legislature as a republican. In the sixth, he showed up as a fusionist and since as a demo crat. Senator Cashel is a man of sub Btance, which he has accumulated by hard work. His interests are in lands and manufactures and banks. He has been a fighter for North Dakota and is one of the best-posted men in the state on questions of taxation, finance and railroads. He is a strong man in the legislature. In speaking of the fight that had been made, Senator Cashel said: "I want first to disclaim this as a demo cratic victory. It was a victory of the people. The insurgent republicans must be allowed their full share of credit. Mr. Burke made a model cam paign.
