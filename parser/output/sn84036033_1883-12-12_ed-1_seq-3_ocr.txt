The Butte Daily Miner The Canadian Pacific has stock outstanding to the amount of $65, 000,000. From p.esent appearances it ts a good stock to let severely alone. Tom Ochiltree, it is said, bolted Keifer 's nomination for speaker. The stalwart prevaricator of the truth from Texas couldn't stand the Ohio dissembler. Ochiltree deserves a credit mark and pardon for all his magnificent lies. Leading Democrats advise a short session of Congress this winter. They hold that all measures looking to a reduction of expenses and a con sequent reduction of the national debt should be strenuously advocated and put on their way toward a final passage. Helena Independent , Dec. 8th: The Inter Mountain says', "Col. McClure comes out in his Democratic paper for Grant. ''Democratic paper. In deed ! The Inter Mountain has just about as correct an apprecia tion of whs ta Democratic paper is as it has of what constitutes common decency in journalism. Postmaster-Ceneral Gresham evi dences his leaning to the centriizaa tion of power by urging the Govern ment Postal Telegraph scheme. Now if the Government could go into the railroad, steamship and express busi ness on a national scale and create a few thousand more offices, what a fine thing it would be for the party in power. Our babyish evening cotemporary devotes nearly a column to a review of a short Miner article which it de clares "has nothing in it." It now becomes a serious question for its readers to consider as to the space it would occupy in commenting upon an article that has something in it. The possibilities are appalling to the lovers of short, crisp notes. The wish Is generally expressed among American newspapers that O'Donnell's sentence be commuted to imprisonment. The English gov ernment would be the gainer by list ening to the suggestion. The execu tion of O'Donnell will still further embitter the Irish people and make them all the more determined in their opposition to English rule. England has now the opportunity to exercise forbearance and make friends. The absence of any reference to the silver question or to the land grant forfeiture matter by the Presi dent in his message cannot be ac counted for only on the hypothesis that he does not desire to commit himself for or against either. They are both of paramount interest to the people and will be leading sub jects for discnssion during the pres ent session. The President's silence in regard to them is singular to say the least. Has there been any way for the county to escape paying four prices for its printing if the Miner chose to charge ii ?— Inter Mountain, 8th inst. Certainly there is a way. It the ig noramus of the InterMountian will constftt the printing law found on pp 60S to 612 inclusive of the Revised Statutes he will find how every county escapes paying four prices for its printing. There is one uniform rate prescribed—about one half the Inter Mountain charges applicants for mineral patents. General Rosecranz shows his mili tary training and the value he places upon a careful organization of forces in the proposition he makes looking to the closing up of the ranks ef the Democratic party. His proposition is to organize the party for the next Presidential campaign into bands of tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, and so on. Over each section is to be placed a chit f, whose office it is to see that his men do their duty and are in line when wanted. The proposition is a feasible one and could be carried out with good results to the party. Thorough organization is as essential to the success of a political party as it is to the success ot an army. , The peculiiar appearance of the sky in this locality, immediately af ter sunset, has been noticed by many. According to 1 an exchange the pe culiarity is not confined here, but is general throughout the country. It was so brilliant at Providence, R. I., a few evenings since that it caused rumors and fears of fires, and at New Haven, Conn., Poughkeepsie and New York alarms were actually given and the department called out. At Norwich and New London, Conn., people were greatly alarmed, and searched diligently by telegraph and telephone. Brockton, Mass., was sure that the great Ames Shovel Works at North Easton were burn ing up, and sent inquiries. Various similar experiences are reported. The phenomenon was considered quite remarkable. • of Mr. Carlisle, the new Speaker of the House, is a man thoroughly na tional in his views. In a reeent in terview, he said he recognized the fa t that it was the principle of which he was the representative that had elected him, and it was some thing to be thankful for that the Democratic party had at last realized that a principle affecting the inter ests of the great majority of the peo ple was vastly more important to the party and the country than the suc cess of any man. He interpreted his election to mean that from this time forth the Democratic parly will go to the people with an aggressive and definite policy and adhere to it be cause it was right and deserved to win. He said that the committees would be organized with a view | solely to the fitness of the members for the various subjects of legislation that would command the attention of Congress, and without undue re gard to their relations to him in the recent contest. Holding these views, it is safe to say he will not disappoint the party which elevated him to his prwent position. THE 

PRINTING LAW AGAIN. The present printing law was cop ied from the one in force in Califor nia for several yean. That law re mained upon the statute books of that state until it was repealed by a subsequent legislature. No judge in that state bad the temerity to declare ,it invalid after it bad been in opera tion two years. If one bad been found to render such a decision he would have been hooted oft the bench. Judges are elected by the people there and honesty is one of the prime qual ifications for the office. In Montana the peo] le are compelled to take such as a partisan administration forces upon them. Some of them were men disposed to be just; others again pros tituted the office to their own and to their party's aggrandizement. There have been too many of the latter in Montana for the good of the Terri tory. That the readers of the Miner may thoroughly understand the in tent and scope of the present print ing law, we Will state that prior to its passage in 1876 the printing for the several counties was let to such papers as the commissioners of the counties designated. The Helena Herald had the printing for Lewis and Clark county. The exhorbi tant charges of that paper for that work became a matter of general complaint among the people there. Its charges were about double tho«e allowed under thé present law. For the purposeof establishing a uniform and cheaper rate for county printing throughout the Territory, the Legis lature of 1876 passed the present printing law. This law provides that the Covernor, President of the Council and Speaker of the House shall constitute a board with power to enter into a contract with some one paper in each county of the Territory to do the printing for which the county is chargable,and if no paper is published in the coun ty, then to provide for the printing in a paper punlished in some other county. The rates to be charged are specified in the law itself and are about one half of those formerly de manded by the Helena Herald , and about one-half of those now charged by the Helena Herald and Inter Mountain for publishing notices of applications for mineral patents. Under this law contracts were let to the Miner to do the printing for Silver Bow county, to the Inde pendent, to do that of Lewis and Clark county; to the Madisonian, for Madison county, and more re cently to the Husbandman of Meagher; and to the Chronicle of Bozeman. The New North-West, the Missoulian the Dillon Tribune and the Benton Record have been doing the printing for their respect ive counties. Under the law the printing has been done in a work manlike manner and much cheaper than formerly. No complaints have been made in regard to overcharges for no overcharging could be made; only one price can be charged and the law states very plainly what that price shall be. The validity of the law has not been seriously questioned. Under it contracts, to do county printing, were let in 1876,1878,1880 and 1882. The Miner still holds an unexpired contract to do the printing for Silver Bow county, signed by Governor Crosby, Granville Stuart as Presi dent of the Council, and Alex. May hew as Speaker of the House. The Miner has also entered into good and sufficient bonds to do that print ing. It has gone to an expense to do it which it otherwise would not have incurred. It stands ready to fulfill its part of the contract, and expects to do it and receive pay for it notwithstanding the decision ot Judge Wade. The time is not far distant when Judge Wade will be a private citizen, and a very private one, too. INI ENT OF 

LEGISLATIVE BODIES. In ascertaining the intent of a leg islative body in enacting any given law, not only the wording of the law itself should be considered, but due regard should be paid ttt the forms and customs observed by &uch bodies. For instance, if the Legisla ture of 1876 intended to authorize the Governor, President of the Council, and Speaker of the House to make contracts with certain newspapers to do the county printing for the sev eral counties of the Territory for a period rf two years frpm that date, aud no longer, it would have pur sued the usual course and designated those officers by name in a joint reso lution incorporating the subject mat ter and terms of the contract instead of passing a general law to be placed upon our statute books. Montana Legislatures are quite as able as those of the most favored States, and winter. | President Arthur gives neither aid nor comfort to a Government Postal Telegraph scheme. He takes the Democratic view of the matter that an enterprise ofthat character would It is said Jay ifubbell has re-1 tired from politics and has gone into the cattle business in Nebraska. > add too largely to the already im mense patronage of the Chief Execu tive. His views, however, has not deterred Senator Edmunds from in troducing a Postal Telegraph bill. It now remains to be seen whether the Republican majority in the Sen ate will sustain the President or fa vor Edmund's scheme to centralize, to a greater extent, the power of the Administration. Hubbell will find it a much more honorable, if not a more profitable, business than levying and collect-j ing assessments from Federal em ployes for political purposes. Dorsey will likely stick to his cattle ranch in thefuture. Next to stealing from the Government, cattle growing seems to be at present the most profitable] business punned. G 

ALIN ISM AT THE RINK. Said I, "Cantankerous" (I always call her cantankerous when I'm in joyful moods, because she always agrees with me over the left), * Can tankerous, let's go to the rink to night." "To—the—rink!" she exclaimed, "to the rink! What! I, a Presbyte rian !" " Why not ?" said I, "is the rink too good for you ?" Said she (her real name is Malvin ia), said she, "Vesuvius, a Presbyte rian is too good for the rink. How would I feel upon my death-bed, obliged to recur to the fact that I weot to the rink this night?" "Upon your death-bed." said I, "why you needn't do it," said I, "It's my opinion that you will be mainly bothered at that time with a pain or over the thought that I'll have a good time." "Vesuvius!" she solemnly ex claimed, "you are worse than a brute, go down to ruin as you please, but I must make my calling and election sure." Said I, "That's just it If you're half the Presbyterian you think you are. you know you were elected be fore you were born, and going to the rink, or not going to the rink will make no difference. If you are to be dam-—" "John Vesuvius ! how dare you !' "Malvinla, I've no desire to be pro fane; but that scandalous catechism you've got in the parlor says that everything was fore-ordained—if so, you'll go to h—" "John Vesuvius! don't you dare to finish that remark—if you do I'll-" "See here, Malvinia," said I, get ting up my dander, "See here, you're either a Presbyterian or you are not a Presbyterian. If you area Presbyterian you knew perfectly well, as a Presbyterian that your fate is sealed and that you can't change it, no matter what you do or what you don't do. So, put on your hat and let's go to the rink." She j ust glared at me. But I could see her edging towaid the bureau wbe>e she kept her things. Now she's perfectly sincere — she was brought up on a straight-backed chair in Connecticut, and she can't get over it. But she saw I meaut to go, and so she concluded she'd go too. As we went out by the gate, I slipped on an orange peel and went down with a whop in the mud. Af ter I bad expressed my opinion of the mud and the oraDge peel and the boy that left it there, I remarked : "Now, some people would cuss that orange peel and baste the brat who dropped it—but a Presbyterian wouldn't. A Presbyterian would get up and smile and walk along without a word. Of course he would—don't a Presbyte rlan know that it was ordained be fore i^dam was born that orange peel should be left in front of our gate? So what's the use of a Presby terian getting mad ?" a Just then we arrived at the rink, and as we went in I remarked, "See here, Mai., it was ordayied that you should come to this rink this night, so put on your skates and pitch in If you're elected, fill the office." The place was full. Skating was m progress at a furious rate; and 800 * Malvinia had the skates on and was wheeling around like any other person. But presently down she went—that is it a woman who sud denly stands on her head and throws her legs into the air can be said to be down. Malvinia got up mad. Why so ? If it had been ordained, from a Presbyterian point of view, that she should throw herself in the manner stated, why, from a Presbyterian point of view, should she get mad? How cou.d she get mad Presbyterian ically I wish to know ? She had to fly in the face of decency. What right then had she to fly in the face of fate (from a Presbyterian point of view) and make herself an eyesore to the catechism? Didn't she have to go to the rink? didn't she have to skate and fall down (or up) and make herself the talk of the town? So I went and picked her up, and as I balanced her upon her feet I re marked: "It had to be." As we went home she wondered if she had shown her stockings. Said I: "You most emphatically did; but you couldn't help it; for long before Abraham it was (from a Presbyterian point of view) ordained not only that you should show them to-night, but that they should be that disgraceful old pair I've asked you 1,000 times to throw away." "John Vesuvius," said she, "John Vesuvius, you are as vulgar as you are profane, and it's a wonder an earthquake don't swallow you up, and you a mayor and calling yourself respectable ! " ( I -| a ^ 9 an< * tee P the gallows a hang I insr Presbyterian. But," said "Malvinia," sam i, solemnly, "Malvinia, if I were a Presbyterian I'd be In jail; for if there's any belief which would legitimately fill the I, "these Christian Mohammedans are as careful as other people, and though (from a Presbyterian point of view) it's wrong to keep your powder dry, yet they try as hard as anyone, when they ought to know that if the powder is ordained to get wet they ought to let it. True," said I, "you may argue that the effort to save the powder was also ordained; but both couldn't be ordained, could they? So, how can you tell when you are not flying in the face of 'election.' I tell 7 UU > y° u ought to be carefel, Mal > vinla." But people can't argue forever; and soon, gone to bed. we were sound asleep, only to awaken in the morn ing with Malvinia with a swelled head and a pair ef legs she couldn't stand up on. She said if I hadn't made her go to that rink it wouldn't have happened. But I told her that (from a Presbyterian point of view) I had to make her go, and that no | one but an anti-Presbyterian could entertain any other view. All of which I am prepared to show Pres byterianically. Now, I've always entertained the belief ihat a man should be what he professes to be. If he is a Presby terian, he should be a Presbyterian— and when he tries to Save his soul he gives the lie to his profession. For, from his cheerful point of view, if his soul is to be lost, it will be lost Therefore, logically speaking, all the deliberate criminals in jail are Pres byterians. They may not t now it, but that's what they are. Nobody but a Presbyterian, except Turks, believes that human beings are doomed to be lost or are set apart for glory; so, when a man "lets go," and don't care a darn, be is a true Pres byterian, for he "cannot by taking thought make one hair white or black.'' Therefore, the Presbyterian who does try, and does hunger and thirst after righteousness, is no more a Presbyterian than I am. For I be lieve a man will be punished for what he does, while your "true-blue" is bound to believe we shall catch it for not doing what we are not per mitted to do from the foundation of the world. This is my line of argument with Malvinia, and it comes in in the matter of those stockings. She had to wear 'em. That's the Presbyte rian idea. They had to be shown; aud they bad to be so full of holes that she forgot she is a Presbyterian, and was ashamed of them. The holes and the showing of the boles are the Presbyterian idea; but the shame was entirely and sinfully op posed to any notion of "calling and election." As she bumped around the next day upon her stiffened legs, and groaned, and mopped her swelled head with bay rum, [ coulda't help asking her what had become of her religion. "Religion!"she exclaimed, "what do you meau?" "Mean?" said I; "do you prétendit is according to Calvin and foreordin ation and election, and predestina tion, and the other doctrines of that old brute who condemned bis own friend to the stake, to grunt when you mash your head, or to whine be cause your legs are stiff as sugar tongf-? Don't you, a Presbyterian, know that the angels knew 9,000,000 years ago that you'd have stiff legs this very day? If you're going to be a Turk, why don't you be a Turk? If the roof is coming down, isn't it your duty to let it come? How dare you, in spite of the fate of Lot's wife, rub that bay ruin on your head ? What's that you say ? Haven't you the right to take medicine when you're sick? No, marin, you have not, not if you're a Pre>byteriaa. It a child's got worms-it must ha\e worms—it should have worms—Ga briel, and Jehcsaphat, and Jeho rara, and Jehoahas, and Jehu. an.'. Jehoiakim, and all the others knew it would have worms ; and you haven't any right to interfere with the worms, that is, from a Presbyte rian point of view. And, in my opinion a Presbyterian pointof view is worse than the worms. I'd rather have the worms. And the child who takes the medicine, and the doctor who prescribes it, and the mother who gives it, and the man who mixes it, and the government that allows it, and the worms that kick the bucket because of it, and the spoon it's given in will surely go to-." "John! John Vesuvius, how dare you !" "How dare I? Dire! Because it's all ridiculous. Can't you see the point? Don't you claim the worms were foreordained ? Now, if that's so, how in thunder is it that a spoonful of the medicine can upset the whole theory of Presbyterianism by killing the worms ? Say ! Oh, it takes a bottle, you say. Suppose it does, then the bottle'll go too. I tell you, Malvinia, if your doctrine were true a whole Atlantic Ocean of ver mifuge couldn't kill one worm. But a spoonful will kill a hundred, and that knocks the bottom right out of Presbyterianism." Here Malvinia began to cry. Ot ( course she wasn't convinced, nor anything like it; but she packed off her catechism, and went to bed with a headache; aud. as I made a nose at the portrait of Calvin on the wail, I wished I had the whole system under my arm, that I might punch its head and let a little daylight into it. John Vesuvius. Bozeman, Nov 28.1883. THE MOUNTAIN LABORED, ETC. Senator Blair is Chairman of the Senate sub-Committee on Education and LaiM>r. This committee was ap pointed at the lastsession of Congress and after the adjournment of that body it went all over the country to listen to every crank who imagined he had the only panacea that would cure all the ills which afflicted the labor market. By the time the com mittee bad accomplished its rounds it was about as thoroughly stuffed body of men as ever sought informa tion. Of course it was expected that when the committee made its report it would offer some valuable sugges tions and probably introduce some measure m the Senate which would cover and correct the labor troubles that have so long afflicted the coun try. Well, the Senate Is in session and the members of the sub-commit tee have had ample time to make out their report. If they have made one the fact has not yet been wired to this portion of the country. But Senator Blair, the Chairman of the Committee, has introduced a bill in the Senate which must be regarded as the cure-all looked for. The bill is nothing more nor less than one pro viding for a national prohibition law. Seuator Blair must know his bill bas not the ghost of a show to pass either branch of Congress, but it la a good bid 'or the temperance vote at the Presidential election; and that is just what it means. The country ex pected something better as the result of the labor and expense of the Sen ate sub-cemmittee. ROSECRANS' BILL. General Bosecrans has prepared, and has probably introduced in the House by this time, a bill providing for an amendment to the Constitu tion to the United States, prohibiting polygamy. The bill will undoubt edly pass both houses of Congress without any opposition to speak of and will be ratified by the Legis latures of the requisite number or States. A similar bill should have been passed years ago when the Republicans had full control of both branohes of Congress, but it seems they had not the courage to tackle the subject in this heroic manner and , left the important duty to a Demo ciatic membter of a Democratic House of Representatives. The [ following is the full text of the bill : Whereas, in pursuance of ouri duty to guard the development of that large and more rational liberty for everv unit of society and that | higher civilization which consists in of .'ïdTu«.« I over the passions by needful consti tutional amendments and provisions, we have for ever prohibited such things as reason andexperience have shown to be hostile or impeding to such development, and among them tiie slave trade, and even slavery itself; and Whereas polygamy, condemned for its contravention of reason, its injustice to women, its degrading in fluence on the character of the fe male sex. and its general repugnance to the spirit of modern freedom and progress, has always been considered so unlikely to be tolerated among us, that no Constitutional prohibition ot it has hitherto been deemed necessa ry to prevent its growth under the protection* of State and Territorial law; and be to ? law; and Whereas the absence of such pro hibition has enabled designing men under pretense of a new revelation from heaven, to appeal to the inter ests and passions ot thé poor, ignor ant people at home and abroad, and to teach then that religious sanc tions and the United States allow the practice of polygamy, and to dif fuse the poison « f this tiarbarious practice through the Teiritories of Arizoua, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, to the great injury of the future well being and good name of the whole people, therefore, Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress As sembled. That, persuant to the pro visions of article five of the Constitu tion of the United States, the follow ing amendment to said Constitution he, and the same is hereby, proposed for ratification by the legislatures of the several States, to wit : AMENDMENT XIV. Sec 1. Polygamy being incom patible with our civilizateon, is for ever prohibited in the United States and aii places under its jurisdiction. Sec. 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this by proper legislation. Resolved. That the Secretary of State shall promptly forward authen ticated copies of this joint resolution to the several States, From the tone of Eastern ex changes the President's mes-age is not received with that degree of sat isfaction which his political friends anticipated. Disappointment is ful ly expressed at his silence upon sev eral very important matters among which are mentioned the improve ment of western rivers, the place sil ver is to take in our business transac tions, the status of several railroad land grants and the reform of the tariff. The general impression pre vails that the document is more re markable for what it does not con tain than for what it does contain. The fact is Mr. Arthur is a candidate for the Presidency and he was very careful not to antagonize any interest by committing himself upon certain eadlng questions. Holman, the Sun's man for the Presidency, and Randall, the de feated candidate for speaker, did the country and their party some good The trial of young Nutt, who 1 killed Dukes, the murderer of his father, at Uniontown, Pa., will take place in Allegheny county, next January, it being impossible to obtain a jury at the homeot the pris oner in Fayette county. It is said tbe feeling in the former county is so strong in favor of Nutt that his acquittal is confidently predicted. Mr. Voorhees, counsel for the de fense, was serenaded by the Union town brass band. This pretty plain ly indicates the tone of the commu nity. San Francisco Chronicle : One of the fruits of Lord Coleridge's visit to this country has appeared in the platt to form a system of District courts throughout England after the model of the District courts in the United States. So favorably has the Suggestion t een received that a bill for this purpose has been prepared by Coleridge and accepted by the abinet. This may seem heresy to the conservative Briton, but there are a good American things outside of the law which England Imitate with great advantage to her common people. of to .
