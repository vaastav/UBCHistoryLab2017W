ESCAPE OF J. A. CHANLER FUR3Ii:il HtSIIAM) OF AMC LI A ItlVKS LKAVES AN INS AM-: ASYLU31. Uail Ilern at IllomliiKdnle Nearly Three Venrw Thinkn lie I a Sort of Jekyll nnd Hyde. NEW YORK. Dec. 4. John. Armstrong Chanler, former husband of Amelle Rives, who has been confined in Bloomingdale Asylum at White Plains, has escaped and is supposed to be "wandering about the country in Westchester county. Mr. Chan ler has been confined in Bloomingdale Asy lum sinco February, 1S37. He had the free run of the grounds and could como and go at will, as he was looked on as a harmless patient. Dr. Lyon, the superintendent of the institution, said to-day that a careful fearch was "being made for the missing man and that he had no doubt but that he would be found within twenty-four hours. He was last seen walking towards Mamro neek. Chänlcr was well known in this country nd I'urope as ilrst husband of the Princess Troubetzkoy, formerly Miss Amelle Rives, tne authoress. Overcome by anxiety, harassed by business annoyance to which he was unaccustomed and disappointed because of his wife's second marriage, Mr. Chanltr's health broke down. His mind became so enfeebled that his friends decided to place him in the. asylum, where he could have absolute quiet. For more than a year previous to the time he en tered the asylum Mr. Chanler had been eccentric. His chief delusion seemed to be that he was a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. LABOR CONFERENCE HELD.

Considers a' dumber of Appeals Asaiiitt Fines and Other Penalties. NEW YORK, Dec. 4. Members of the National Trotting Association, to the num ber of a score or more, met at the Murray Hill Hotel, where they will be in session for several days. President P. P. Johnson, of Lexington, Ky., was chairman. The first work of the day was the taking of testi mony in the matter of disputed and con tested races during- the last season, cases of entering horses out of class, the matter of fines and expulsions or suspensions from the association of horses and their owners, and the matter of reinstatement of their horses having been under suspension for a greater or less length of time. The mem bers of the board present were P. P. John son, of Lexington. Ky., president; W. II. Goeher, of Hartford, Conn., secretary; C. D. Palmer, of Lowell, Mass.; George W. Archer, Rochester; William Russell Allen, Plttsfield, Mass.; David Bonner and John II. Shults. of New York, and E. C. Blake, of Cedar Rapids, la. The board ruled against John Kopp &. Bro. In the case of their mare Jean In gelow, which they had entered as having no mark, when she had made a record to wagon before their purchase, though with out their knowledge. Application for a refund of a line of $x0 against the Louisville Driving Association for failure to report fines and suspensions made in 1S09 was refused. No decision was reached in Harry Dev creaux's appeal on tho ownership of a pri vate record made on the Cleveland track in a private trial, not for money or trophy. The board refused to reinstate James O'Brien, alias James Reed, expelled for re fusal to drive a horse at Baltimore after his name had been changed. The board awarded to the mare Garnet, which was alleged to have raced and won under the name of Foxy S., the purses won by her during the season. She is owned by Vernon Miller. George W. Brown, of Greenfield, who had been temporarily re instated, had his reinstatement made per manent. H. A. Pennock, of Minerva, O., was expelled for "ringing." o Decisions at Chicago. 

CHICAGO, Dec. 4. Tho Board of Review of the American Trotting Association be gan its annual Chicago meeting to-day and will continue in session several days. The only cases of interest to-day were one in which the Cleveland pacer. Octagon, record 2:'X4, was the central figure, and the mat ter of the pacing race between Anaconda and Searchlight at the Indiana state fair. In September last. The charge against Oc tagon was that the horse had been driven In a race by a man who had been expelled from the association. In the Searchlight-Anaconda matter the contract between the managers of the horses and the Indiana State Board of Ag riculture was submitted, together with an answer by the board to the application for an ordT that the second money in the race be paid to Searchlight, ilrst money having already gone to him by virtue of the fact that he distanced Anaconda In the race. The board took both cases under advise ment, will consider them in executive ses sion and render a decision later in the week. Yesterday's Running; Winners.

Dunton. formerly auditing clerk of tho Union National Bank, was to-day found guilty of the embezzlement of $15,5o0. Sen tence was not pronounced. The defense offered no evidence in the case. Dunton was an Intimate friend of Assistant Teller George Forbes, of the First National Bank, the two having worked together in the Union National before its absorption by the First National. Forbes committed suicide some months ago. His books showed a discrepancy in his accounts, and It was learned that despondency over this short age, which was caused by Forbes loaning money to Dunton on the latter's promise that he would repay It, drove him Into tak ing his life. Dunton was captured at Old Tolnt Comfort, Va. TOD SLOAN LOSES. Xot an Good a Shot nt PJceoits ns He Is a Jockey. NEW YORK.

Besides, it covers receipts and expenditures, coins and coin age, engrossing and printing, public moneys, national banks, loans and currency, cus toms and the work of all the bureaus con nected with the Treasury Department. Many of the features of the report have been giveriout from time to time as the bureaus submitted their reports, and a synopsis of the whole was utilized by the President in hi3 message yesterday. The secretary says the revenues of the government from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 3J, 190), were JC.59Ö, 431.13, whllo the expenditures for the same period were 0,008,371, leaving a surplus of $79, 527.0C0.1S.

The greatest difference between income and outgo on any one day was $1.047.396.05 in favor of the treasury. The corresponding maximum deficit ncy was $2,318.621.42. In the face of such wide fluc tuations the necessity for ample available reserves is apparent, and the treasurer names $50,000.000 as a proper sum to keej. in the government vaults." CHANGES IN CIRCULATION. , After giving the salient points of the an nual reports of the treasurer and the con troller of the currency (published some time ago) Secretary Gage says: "The changes in the amounts of the sev eral kinds of money In the United States outside the treasury between Nov. 1, 1S99, and Nov. 1. 1900. are shown in the table following. The estimated population of the United States Nov. 1. 1S99. was 76,6.t9.0i0. and the per capita supply of money outside the treasury was $25.00. The estimated population and per capita supply of money Nov. 1. 190. were 76.S9l.000 and J27.S2, respectively: I Nov. l. IM I N.,v I.

The correction of this estimate, together with the increase during the year in the voiurae'of money in circulation, increases the estimated circulation per capita from J.v.a cs it wa stated in the report for 1S99, to $27.32. Nov. 1. liu). "On Nov. 21 the secretary gave public notice that refunding would be indefinitely suspended at the close of business on Dec. 31, 19O0. The considerations which Induced this action may be briefly stated:' "First Nine months will have elapsed 1 since the passage, of the refunding act. Thus the holders of bonds will have had abundant opportunity to make the ex change authorized. "SecondTo leave the privilege open in definitely Is simply to give a continuing option to bondholders without any sufficient consideration to the treasury. . "Third It may be fairly assumed that with this privilege discontinued at the close of the year, refunding In the meantime will bo stimulated, and that the total refunding to that date will approximate $400,000,000. "Fourth The sinking-fund law contem plates the retirement of the interest-bearing public debt, either bj payment or pur chase of substantially $50,000,000 per an num. "Fifth The refunding of J 100,000.000 will leave outstanding and maturing within the next eight years, say, 5139.000,000, or an average of something more than SO.OOO.O'j'J per year. "The secretary believes that the suspen sion of the refunding process will put the maturing debt under better conditions (the government's Interest alone considered) either for purchase from time to time or for payment when due. It will, of course, re main open for the department to resume refunding, should the Interests of the gov ernment and the general conditions of finance make such a course desirable. REDUCTION OF REVENUE. "From the estimates of receipts and ex penditures for the fiscal year 1302 there promises to be an excess of receipts to the amount of $26,000.000. It Is hardly necessary to point out that estimates are at best ap proximate. Exigencies in the public serv ice which cannot be anticipated may re quire expenditures not contemplated. Con gressional appropriations, extraordinary in character, or failures to realize fully esti mated revenues, are also Influences which may operate seriously to derange all ad vance calculations. A conservative margin should, therefore, be reserved in forecasting definite results based on hypothetical cal culations. "An annual excess of receipts over expen ditures is the best indorsement of the na tional credit, while a deficit Is a depressing factor in public finance. It has been our wise policy in the past to reduce the public debt in time of peace, and to this good pol icy may be attributed, to a high degree, the low rates of interest, hitherto unprecedent ed, which now attach to our government debt obligations. It is true that for a period of six year?, from 1SD4 to 1S99, in clusive, annual deficits appeared; but it may be hoped that this was a temporary Interruption to a history of twenty-eight 3rears, when each year showed annual ex penditures less than annual revenues. "The operation of the act of Feb. 23, 1S62, providing for a sinking fund, contem plates the payment or purchase and can cellation of substantially $50,000.000 annu ally of our interest-bearing debt obliga tions. Owing to the unfavorable conditions in the treasury during" the six years just referred to, the sinking fund was entirely neglected. "In the absence of any expression to the contrary. It may be safely assumed that It it,- the desire of Congress to observe faith fully the general requirements of the sink ing fund act and to provide revenue suffi cient to meet the charges thus imposed upon the government. The present and prospective easy condition of the treasury Justifies the belief that the fclnking fund requirement can be met, both for the cur rent fiscal year and for the next fiscal year, and still permit a moderate reduction In taxes imposed by the war revenue act. A reduction to the amount of $30,000,000 is therefore recommended to the consideration of the present Congress. 

STANDARD AND CURRENCY. "The operation of the act of March 14 last with respect to these two important matters of our finances has well exem plified its wisdom." Confidence in the pur pose and power of the government to maintain the gold standard 1 has been greatly strengthened. The result is that gold flows toward the treasury instead of away from it. At the date of this report the free gold In the treasury is larger In amount than at any former period in our history. Including the $150,000,000 re serve, the gold in the treasury belonging to the government amounts to over $242, 000,000, while the treasury holds, besides, more than $230,000,000, against which cer tificates have been issued. "That provision of the act which liberal ized the conditions' of bank note issue was also wise and timely. Under it, as pre viously shown in7 this report, there has been an increase of some $77,000,000 in bank note issues. To this may be chiefly at tributed the freedom from stress for cur rency to handle the large harvests of cot ton, wheat and corn. In this respect the year has been an exception to the general rule of stringency which for several years has so plainly marked the autumn season. "Nevertheless, the measures referred to, prolific as they have been in good results, will yet need reinforcement in some im portant particulars. Thus, as to the re demption fund provided for in said act. while the powers conferred upon the sec retary are probably ample to enable a zealous and watchful officer to protect fully the gold reserve, there appears to be lacking sufficient mandatory requirement to furnish complete confidence In the con tinued parity, under all conditions, be tween our two forms of metallic money, silver and gold. Upon this point further legislation may become desirable. "As to the currency, while the liberaliz ing of conditions has, as previously noted, found response In a necessary increase of baoik note issues, there is under our pres ent system no assurance whatever that the volumo of bank currency will be con tinuously responsive to the country's needs, either by expanding as such needs require or by contracting when superflu ous in amount. The truth is that, safo and desirable as Is our currency system In many respects. It Is not properly re lated. The supply of currency is but re motely, if at all. influenced by the ever- chaneinfr requirements of trade and In dustry. It Is related most largely, if not entirely, to the price of government bonds in the market. Between the needs of trade and commerce for a medium of ex change and for instruments of credit, which a proper bank note furnishes, and the investment price or value of govern ment bonds, which is at present the most influential factor in determining the cur rency supply, there is no discernible rela tion whatever. "I forbear at this time. In view of the many other Important subjects which de mand attention during the present short session of Congress, to press these ques tions for immediate action, but I cannot refrain from inviting the attention of sen ators and representatives to a careful con sideration of the matters thus suggested. In the act of March 14 a forward step was taken, to the great benefit of. all our ma terial interests. Nothing should prevent timely and well-considered amendments where necessary to solidify and complete the work so well inaugurated."
