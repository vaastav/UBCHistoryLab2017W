It will be of more benelit to your selves, iu after years, than to any one else. Give your teachers as little trouble as possible. I have, quite a number of times warned the citizens of Odessa to be careful abont fire, and I am glad te see that tbe Herald is now calling attention to the disasters which may be conse quent upon it, and advises the forma tion of a book and ladder company. It Is a good idea, and should be carried out immediately. Before tbe Intelligencer's "new de parture' in employing a special nies senger to bring its paper here, it used to reach tbis place on Monday. Now it gels here, every Saturday morning, bright and early, and if the carrier will bring up his new year's greeting, he will be able to dispose of it. Several of ns will have a quarter lor him. Rather an amusing wager was made some weeks ago. at the blacksmith shop ol Mr. A. L. Maxwell. A three dollar hat is at stake, and It will take about as many years, I think, to decide the bet as it will dollars to buy the bat. Mr. Maxwell says he will win the bet. Sam Keller says that be will win it. bowdry Mcllatton is silent, considering tbe mat ter; there is no doubt, though, but what he hopes to see Sam win the bet. Several of our young gentlemen an very much mystified as to how their bats became receptacles for so mauy pins, Friday night of last week, after the ba nil supper, which was, by tho way, an ele gant repast. served at the Odessa House They say they have beard ol "bricks' In hats, but never before of pins. Some ol them are ungenerous enough charge Ihe ladies with having played this prank; but they didn't, of course The ball, Friday night of last week was not very largely attended, owing no doubt, to the inclement state of the weather. It was a pleasant affair, nev ertlieless, and the ladies and gentlemen present had a good lime, whiting away the hours in the mazy dance and in so cial tcte-e-tetes. The club, under whose auspices the ball was givcn,contemplate giving a series of dances during the winter, I am told, and it is to be hoped they will carry out their determination. Odessa aspires to be something more than a country village, yet she does net hope to prosper by abuse ol ber sister towns. She does not spent dendlngly ot her neighbors, but witli due defer ence to their claims, she thinks she is, as she has said she was, the "boss." Figures are stubborn things, and they speak volumes.

Fellow Citizens or Ihe fieuale anil House of Representative: 1 congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity ol our coun try. By the favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed during the past year with health, with abundant bar vests, with profitable employment lor all our peop e, with contentment at home, and peaee and friendship with other nations. The occurrence ot the twenty-fourth election of obiet magistrate has afforded another opportunity to the people ot the United States to exhibit to the world a significant example ot ihe peacelul and sate transmission of the government from tbe public servants whose terms of office are about to expire, to the new ly chosen successor. This example cannot tail to impress thoughtful peo ple of other countries with the advanta ges which republican institutions afford. The immediate, general and cbcerlul acquiescence of all good citizens in the result of the election gives satislyng evi dence to our country and to its friends throughout tne world that a govern ment based on tbe tree conseat ot an intelligent and patriotic people, pos sesses elements ol strength and per manency not round in auy other form of government. Continued opposition to the full and free employment of the rights ot citi zenship, conterred upon the colored peo ple by tbe recent amendments to the constitution, still pievails in several late slave holding stales. It has, par- baps, not been manifested in the recent election, to any large extent, in acts of iolence or intimidation, it has bow- ever, by fraudulent practices, in con nection with the ballots, with the reg ulations as to tbe places and manner of oting. and with counting, returning and canvassing the votes cast, been successlul in defeating the exercise ol the right preservative of all rights right of suffrage which the constitution expressly confers upon our enlranehis ed citizens. It is tbe desire of the good people ol the whole country that se tionaliam.as a factor in our politics, should disappear. ihoT prelar that no section ol the coun try should be united in solid opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt, hearty obedience to the equal rights' amendments to the consti tution is all that now stands in the way of complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests, as long as eitn or of these amendents is flagrantly vio lated or disregarded.it is sale to assume that the people who placed them in the constitution, as embodying the legitimate results of tbe war for tbe umon.and who believe them to be wine and necessary, will continue to act together and to in sist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the enjoyment of Ihe right by every American citizeti who bas the requisite qualification, lo cast bis vote aud have it honestly counted. With tbis question rightly settled the country will be reliev ed ot the contentions of the past. By gones will indeed be by-gones, and po litical and party issues with respect to economy and efficiency ot administra tion, internal improvements, the tariff. domestic taxation, education, finance and other important subjects, will then receive their lull sbare of attention, uut resistance to the nullification ot the re sult ot the war will unite together reso lutely for theirsupport all who maintain tbe authority of government and the perpetuity of the union, and who ade quately appreciate the value ol the vic tory achieved. This determination pro ceeds from no hostile sentiment or teei ng to any part of the people ot our gov ernment. They are the solemn expres sion ot the will of the people of tbe Uni ted States. The sentiment that the con stitutional rights ol all our citizens must be maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue to control the govern ment of the country. Happily the his tory of the late election shows that in many parts of the country, where oppo sition to the fifteenth amendmtnt has heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether, it firm and considerate action is taken by con gress. 1 trust the nouse oi representatives and the senate, which have the right to judge of the election returns and quali fications ot their own memoers, win see to it that every case ot violation ot tbe letter or spirit of the mteentn amend ment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benefit Irom such violation shall accrue to any person or party. It will be the duty ot the executive, with sufficient appropriations tor tbe puipose, to pros ecute unsparingly all who have been en gaged in depriving citizens ol the right it guaranteed to mem oy me constitu tion. It is not, hewever, to be lorgot ten that the best and surest guaranty of tbe permanency of tbe rights of citizens is to be found in the capacity lor sell preservation, which can belong only to a people whoso right to universal sul - frage is supported ny universal euuea tion. The means at the command of the local and state authorities are, in maay cases wholly inadequate to lur- nish tree instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where, before emancipation, the education ol the peo ple was neglected or prevented iu the interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that tbe subject ol popular education deserves the earnest attention ol the people ot the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by tbe government ol the Uniled States, I respectlully recommend that congress, by suitable legislation and with proper saieguards, supplement tbe local edu cational funds in the several states where tbe grave duties and responsibil ities of citizenship has been devolved on uneducated people by devoting to the purpose grants of tbe public lands and, it necessary, by appropriations Irom the treasury of the United Stales. Whatever the government can possibly do to promote free and popular educa tion ought to be done. Wherever gen eral education is found, peace, virtue and social order prevail and civil and religious liberty are secure. In my former annual messages 1 have asked the attention of congress to the ur gent necessity of a reformation ol the civil service system of the government. My views concerning tbe dangers ol pat ronage or appointments for personal or partisan considerations luive been slrengthend by my observation nd expe rience in tbe executive office, and 1 beleve these dangers threaten the stability ol the government. Abuses so serious in. their nature cannot be pai m:inontl v lo'er atod. They tend lo become more alarm ing with the enlargement of the admin istrative service, as the growth ot the country In population iuLMeases the nuiu ber ol olhees and phices lor men em ployed. The reasons are imperative lor the adoption ol'1'iv.ed ru'esto regulate appointment'.proinetioiis and removals establishing a ttnltorm method, having exclusively in view, in every instance. the attainment of the be-L jii-ilitica!ions lor the position iu question, bucli method alone is consistent with the equal rights ol all citizens and the eco nomical and ellicieut administration of public business. Competitive e.vtuiina lions, in aid of impartial opportunities and promotions, have been conducted (tor some years past in several ol tiic ex ecutive departments, and b my direc tion this system has been adopted in the customs and poslofliccs of the larger cit ies ol the country. In the city ot New York over 2,U0j persons in the civil service have been subject in tln-ir ap pointment and tenure ol phtce to the op eration ot published rules lot this pur iter . No. 40. pose. During the past two years Ihe results of these practical rules have been very satisfactory and have coufirmed my opinion in favor ol tbis system ol selec tion. All are subject to the same tests, and the resu;t is free from prejudice by personal favor or partisan influence. It secures for the position applied Tor the best qualifications attainable among tun competing applicants, it is an effectual protection Irom the pressure oi impor tunity which, under any other course pursued, largely exacts the lime and at tention ol appointing officers, to their great detriment iu the discharge of oth er official duties, preventing the abuse of the service tor the mere lurtherance ol private or party purposes, and leaving tbe employ ot tbe government treed from tbe obligations imposed by patron age to depend soleiy upon merit lor re tention aud advancement; and with this constant incentive to exertion and im provement, these invaluable results have been attained iu a large - degree. In the offices where tli" rules lor ap pointment by competitive examination have been applied a method which so approved itsoli by experimental tests at points whero such tests may be lairly con sldered proved conclusively that they should be extended to all siibordinut po sitions under tho government. 1 bulievu that a strong and growing public senti ment demand immediate measures lor se curing and enforcing tbe highest possible efficiency in the civil service.and its pro tection Irom recoguized abuses, and that the experience reierred to has demon strated the feasibility ol such measures. Tbe examination in tbe custom houses and postoffices have been beld under many embarrassments am! without pro vision lor compensation tor ilie extra la bor perlormed by the officers who have conductedthem.aiid hosocouiinendable interest in the improvement of the public service has itiiluued this devotion of tune and labor without peuuuiury reward. A continuance ol these labors gratuitous ly ought not lo be expected, and without au appropriation ol congress for a com pensation, it is uotprac.ii:aoic to extent! the system ot examinations general iv throughout tho civil service. His also highly important thai all such examina tions should be conducted upon a uni form system, and umler general super vision. : .seel ion 1858, ol the revised statues, authorizes tb. president to prcscrior the regulations for admission lo t lie civil service of the United States, and for this purpoee to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite in quiries with reference to llic fuimss of each candidate in renpect lo age, health, charai:ier,kuowle(l:eaiid abil ity, for tho branch ol service into which lie seeks to filler, but the law is practical v inoperative for Ihe want of a requisite appropriation ; 1 there- lore recommend an appropriation of 000 per annum lo meet the ex pense ot a commission tti be appoint ed by the president, in accordance with the terms of this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uni form and efficient system of coinpe tive examinations, ami to supervise the application of the same thiougn out the entire civil service of the government. I am persuaded that tin: facilities which such a commission will afford for testing the fitness of those who apply lor oflice, will not only be as welcome a iclief to ihe members of congress as it will be to the president aud heads of depart ments, but that it will also greatly teud to remove the causes ot embar rassment which now inevitably ami constantly attends th coullicliiig claims of pairoiugj between the legislative ami executive depart ments, the most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of inlluencu and official favori teisin iu tin: be stowal of office, will be the substitu tion of au open competition of merit between applicants, in which every one can make his own record willi the assurance I hat his eucces will de pend uiiou him alone. I also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as Ireo as any other citizen to express Ifn political opinions and to uso Ins menus for their advancement, slnnl, also, enable him to ieel as safu as any private citizen iu refusing all demand - upon his salary lor polilical purpose A law which should thus guai'uiili true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in Ihe public servict'.aud liUewi.-e stringent provisions against the use ot official authority to coerce the polilical a:lioii of private citi zens or of official uuiiordiles is greatly to be desired. The most ser ious obstscles, however, to an im provemciii of the civil service, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and reinuval, has been found to be the practice under what is known as the spoils stslciu, by which the aim noting power lias been So laigei encroached upon by members i-Cungres. The lni step in the rcloriu in civil service iim.l lie a complete divorce between coniir.Ms ami the executive in the matter of appointments. I lie corrupting doc trines thai to llic victors belong llic spoils is inseparable li oin coures-ion al pa'. rouage; as the eslublished rule and practice of parlies in power. comes to be understood by applicants lor oflice ami by the popie gcuerally that representatives uud senators are entitled to disburse I lie patronage ol their respective dislrici.-. and states. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this invusi.m ol the executive functions. The true principles ot government on Ihe sub ieel ol appoiimui-iits of office, as stated in Ihe national convent ions of the leading parlies of the country, nave aiiuin ami aani ue.u aporovcu by ihe American people, and have not been called m question iu any quarter. These authentic expressions ot puuuc opinion upon tins all im portant subject, are the statement of principles that belaug lo the con stitutional structure of the govern meiit.

Ihe best iu terests of the public service demands that these disiinclions be respected that senators and representatives who may be judges and accusers should ltd dictate appointments to office.
