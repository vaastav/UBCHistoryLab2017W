Unen of Blackmailing, Opens 1 lie Closet ami Shows til»; Skeleton—He Claims to l>e Moen's First lint Ineonveniently-Eariy lloru Son. Providence , R. I., Dec. 2.—Unable to bear tlio strain upon his mind any longer, ••Doc'" Wilson, broken down in health and weeping like a child, told the great secret which has existed between him and P. L. Moen. of Worcester, for so many years. He told the story in the presence of four reputable citizens, who furnished it to the press. ■•I am looked upon as a blackmailer." tie said, ' and those who believe I have been bleeding that old man hold me in as much contempt as a yellow dog. But 1 I will not stand it any longer. I am more j sinned against than sinning, and now the I truth shall be known. My name is not ! Wilson, nor am I the son of James Wilson. i My father is the man who is accusing me J of blackmail, and my name is Levi Moen. j the lawful son of P. L. Moen, of Worces ! ter." j Mr. Wilson then went on to tell the story I of his birth and the wrong done him by I his father. His story is that he is the son of Moen's first wife, and that he was born a few months al ter the marriage. Moen being a deacon and professedly a high toned christian, did not wish to face the scandal of such an early birth for his first born, so a bargain was made with one Jonas Wilson, of Danielsonville. Conn., a stage driver, by which the babe was transferred to the hitter's care, and was brought up as a Wilson. The boy lived and toiled in the humble sphere to which he says Moen consigned him. and it was not until he was a young man »rown that he learned the secret of his birth. Forthat secret lie was indebted to the religious remorse of his supposed father. Jonas Wilson, who. being on his death-bed. and not caring to pass the por tals with the burden on his soul, drew the lad toward him and told him who lie was. After Wiison died the young fellow set of! for Worcester to meet his father face to face. Their first meeting, Wilson says, was exactly as has been described. He did meet Moen on that particular morning and after observing the signs of wealth and luxury that abounded, he demanded of Moen some reparation for the wrong done to one who should be the heir to ail. Moen at first refused to acknowledge the lad, and would have driven him forth, but the boy faced his millionaire parent defiantly and upbraiding him for the wrong done his mother and himself he said: '• -I will force you to acknowledge me, and world shall know you for what you are.' Then the banker became alarmed and gave me §100,"' By appointment he met Moen the next day and consented to shield his unnatural father from sharne. The father had in the meantime married again, after the death of ''Doc's'' mother, and married into a family which would have scorned Moen. had they known of the scandal. Then, ae corning to Mr. Wilson's story, the Wilsons, who knew the secret of his parentage, seeing "Doc" had money, and knowing it came from Moen, began to urge claims upon him. Their de mands increased, and to satisfy them he had to apply to Moen for money, and in that way much of the sum received from the banker was spent. Mr. Wilson says that these demands upon him grew so ex orbitant that he was almost impoverished by them. The Engly suits were settled, he said, at Moen's suggestion, and with Moen's money, because the latter fear his relationship to Wilson would come out some way in the trial. Wilson has letters, which, he says, are written by Moen, acknowledging the re lationship, and calling him "Dear Son.' These letters Wilson produced yesterday. He says he is the injured one. as instead of bei«ig reared as a gentleman, and brought up amid the luxuries which his father's wealth could pur chase, he was cast adrift, reared as a peasant boy. without education and without any of the refinements of lif. which would have been his, had his cruel parent done right. Mr. Wilson says lie can no longer endure the calumnies with which he is assailed, and that his con fession of the secret is true in every re spect. Moen interposes a weak denial. The Monthly Statement of the I'utilic De Washington , Dec. 2.—The reduction in the public debt during November amount ed to 53,(105,249. The total debt, less cash in the Treasury, is now SI,351.342,089. The net cash balance in the Treasury is $10,093,550. against §52,083,199 a month ago. Redemption of three per cent, bonds ac counts for this reduction in net cash. On November 1 there were §36,848.700 in three per cents, outstanding, while yesterday's statement reports but $71,251,250 outstand ing. The gold coin and bullion fund in the treasury is §254,450,853, with liabilities of gold certificates outstanding of 190,520,603, thus leaving a gold fund balance of §103, 930,220. On November 1 this gold balance tvas §158,537,179. There are now §105,519, 517 in silver certificates outstanding, or about five and a quarter millions more than a montl* ago. The treasury now holds 18-4,911,938 standard silver dollars, an increase of nearly 2,000,000 during the past month. Government receipts during November from sources are §27,570,102, or two millions more than during November a year ago. Customs receipts were §15,140,645, against 813,056,651 during November, 1885, internal revenue recepts were §9,689.251, nearly half a million more than in November 1885. Expenditures during November were $25,557,809, or two millions more than dur ing November, 1885. The total revenue for the first five months of the current year is §152,060,192, or $11,000,000 more than the corresponding five months of 1S85. Expenditures for these five months of 1886 were §125,917,834, or about §11,000,000 more than for the cor responding five months in 1885. More than fö, 000,000 of this increased expenditure over the expenditures of the five months in 1885 is due to payment of Alabama claim awards. Commissioner Miller, of the Internal Revenue Bureau, while not yet having any official data on the subject, estimates the November oleomargarine tax receipts at §400,000, half of which probably comes from license tax. He thinks the tax on oleo margarine will net a revenue of $2,000,000, or perhaps more, dur g the coming fiscal year.

Governor Sivineford 's Report to t ile Me'-re tary of the Interior—Erronemm Impres sion* Corrected—An Undeveloped Sourer of Fish Supply—An Appropria Won Want ed for Educational Purposes. Washington , Dec. 2.—Govern»!* Swine ford of Alaska, in his annual re,p*jrfc W j the Secretary of the Interior, estimates the white population of the Territory at 2,350, the native population at 32,M0. Of the na tive Alaskans he says they are a very su perior race intellectually as aonipared with the people generally known as North American Indians, and are. as a rale, in dustrious and provident, and wholly self-sustaining. They live ia neat, comforable homes of their own construc tion. They are shrewd and natural born traders, some are passably go'-)d ear pen ters. and others are skillful workers in woods and metals, not a lew speak Eng lish, and some, id' the younger men and women have learned to read ami write, and nearly all are anxious for the educa tion of their c hildren. The Governor comments upon what he terms the wide-spread but erroneous be lief that Alaska is a region • ■ pej^petual winter, and appends a mete jrologicaJ summary for the year, which »kows that the coldest weather occurred m January 5, when the mercury sank to four degrees above zero, where it remained for half a day only. The industries of Alaska, says the report, are as yet principally confined to the fur trade, mining and the, curing and canning of fish, of which there are about sixty food varieties, the. nod, sal mon and halibut beingthe most important. As to the cod banks, he says a- market is all that is required to make them a scene of even greater activity tr.au was ever known in those of Newfoundland. As U the salmon, he says they are aft plentiful a- the cod, and keep in operation eight canning establishments. The fur trade, the report says, may be approximately stated at the market valu« of *2,000.000 annually, nearly ail ol' whicfe is controled by the Alaska Commercial Company. Coal has been found at various points in ithe Territory, but as yet no well directed effort has been made to dovelttpe any of the seams. The Governor asks that ?4fl.flfiî} bn appro priated for school purposes, lie cum the non-punishment of the offenders in Chinese outrages in that Territory last summer and the failure to bring back the Chinese who were sent to Wraagle Land. Although the law prohibits the importa tion of spirits into Alaska, the law, the Governor says, is not enforced, but much contraband liquor is smuggled in. Tc remedy this state of affairs he suggests that the présent law be repealed and stringent license regulations lie adopted, as they would be far preferable tc '•prohibition which does not prohibit." A law for the better protection of seals and other fur-bearing animals is weoded to prevent the destruction of this industry. In conclusion, the Governor sojs Alaska should have a delegate in Congress and should have a territorial form r.f govern ment, similar to that of other Term,,, r^sr THE PACIFIC ROADS. >rfc to th« t.Hö Pacific Commissioner Johnson's Secretary of the Interior Railways, Washington , Dec. 2.—Genera! Jahnston. Commissioner of Railroads, in his annual report to the Secretary of the laterior on the Pacific) railways, says the Union Pa cific road is in excellent condition and first-class in all respects. The funded debt of the Union Pacific on June S), 1886, amounted to §115,048,189, against §116.4-41. 797 the year before. The net earnings ol the road for the year ended December 31. 18S5, were §8,404,676, against $*,941,909 for the year before. The Central Pacific road is reported in good condition, extensive improvements having been made. The net earnings for the year ended December 31, 1885, were §10.250.882, an increase of §2.4:10,5:30 over the previous year, The Northern Pacific is reported in very good shape. The net earnings of the road for the year ended June 30. T-.so were $5. 574,263, an increase of $530.413 over the year before. In reviewing the condition nf the sink ing funds of the Union and Central Pacific roads. Commissioner Johnston says the law of 1878 is inadequate to the object for which it was enacted, that of producing a sum sufficient to pay the debts that will be due to the United States from the "aided"' roads, and that additional and judicious legislation will be necessary to enable those companies to discharge theii debts to the Government. He ther presents the following statement in support of this assertion. The total amount of interest paid by the United States on account of subsidy bonds up to June 30, 1886, was ¥70,854,325.62. There had been retained by Hie Treasury Department for transportation services and credited fo the interest accounts §21, 091,383.32; sinking fund account, $9.658. 713.10; total. §30,705.090.42; leaving an ex cess of interest paid by the Government amounting to §40,104.229.20. f STONE WILL NOT DOWN.
