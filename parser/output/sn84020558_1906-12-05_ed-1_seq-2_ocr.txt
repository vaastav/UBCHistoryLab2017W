One of the finest points of the president's message transmitted to congress yesterday was the absence of r.ll reference to Joint statehood. There was no arrrehension that this subject would be revived at this time and there Is little liklihood that it will come up at any other time. The whole matter has been threshed out both in the territories 'and in the nation at large and the verdict has been most pronouncedly against joint pre. There can be no conception of a change of condtions which would ever make the joining of Arizona and New Mexico more acceptable to the whale country than it is now. An interesting feature of the mes sage is the recommendation of an ex tension of federal authority in such cases as that which has arisen at San Krancisco over the Japanese question. V'e hardly think that that recommen dation will be favorably received by a majority in congress. It is possible that the Japanese of San Francisco have not been properly secured in ail their treaty rights, but the people of no state will admit that they may no! adopt such laws as they see fit for the regulation of their schools. Ther. may be a denial that congress can con- I fer a treaty right upon any foreigner I if such richt is in conflict with . ! right the constitution has already giv- en to the states. It has never been disputed that a state may designate that pupils of one color may not attenu a school intended for pupils of another color. An interestingthing in this head of the message is the president's argu ment, that in as much as the goverr ment is bound to protect a city, say Han ' Francisco af.ainst invasion by a foreign foe, it should be given the power to regulate the affairs in that city in such a manner that there shall be no provocation of the invasion. The allusion to Porto Rico, concern lug which much has been expected by reason of the president's recent visit U that island, was brief, though It contains recommendation of the islanders to citiaenship, a condition which the presi dent somewhat anticipated in rerentTy fclrestng groups of them as citizens. Voluminous and comprehensive as the message is there Is hardly a rec- i ommcndatlun in it which will take the country by surprise. Through the heads of the departments in the recent campaign the views of the president may be regarded as having been re- fVcted. on all subjects which have just . now been presented to congress. In order successfully to engage in faking one should be thoroughly fa miliar with the subject In hand. The !
