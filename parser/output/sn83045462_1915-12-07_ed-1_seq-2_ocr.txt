This is a matter of importance." "What is it all about?" asked the occupant of the apartment from behind the partly closed door. "We have a telegram from the chief of police askinsr for your arrest on a charge of murder," said Spr'ngmann sharply, "and we want you." Etchison opened the door and admit ted the detectives. He asked permis sion to write a check for his wife, which was granted, and a few minxites later he was behind the bars at the first precinct police station. When questioned bv the detectives, who had not been told anything of the circum stances of the alleged murder, the prisoner said he supposed the arrest was in connection with the death of Mrs. Price.

Mobilization of the forces from all parts of the country, which for the next four days will discuss the needs of adequate system of inland waterways, began here to day. It was the vanguard of the thousand or more delegates who will attend the twelfth annual convention of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, which will open tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock at the New Willard Hotel with an address by Secretary Wil liam C. Redfield of the Depart ment of Commerce. The registration headquarters were opened on schedule at 11 o'clock on the mezzanine floor of the New Willard, but none of the delegations had put in an ap pearance at noon. Two delegations, how ever, arrived in the city. They came from Ohio and Oklahoma. It is expected that the delegations from various parts of the country will be arriving continually dur ing the afternoon and night. The regis tration bureau probably will get its rush of work tomorrow morning Just about the time the convention opens, at 10 o'clock. The Invocation will be delivered by Rev. Earle Wilfley, pastor of the Vermont Avenue Christian Church. Flans Are Discussed. Plans made by the advisory com mittee for the convention were dis cussed today at a meeting of that body in the office of 8. A.

Patten ef Chatta nooga, Albert Hettinger of Cincinnati, Senator Joseph E. Ransdell, president of the congress, and 8- A. Thompson, secretary-treasurer, the last two ex officio members of the body. A popular note Is expected to be struck in the convention meetings this year in the relation of an adequate inland waterways system to a national pre paredness program. Many of the speeches. It is believed, will turn to ward the need of a network of water ways as an essential part of the na tional defense program. Representative J. Hampton Moore of Pennsylvania will deal principally with this side of the waterways question in his address Thursday. Coastal canals, it is pointed out, will at gziit ut ,? In modern defensive operations for the rapid shifting of submarines and tor pedo boats, and protecttgr them from risks which they would run if forced to travel in the outside waters. The Inland system also would be of consid erable use for the transportation of supplies in time of war ana would re lieve the railroads of traffic Jams In time of peace. The outgoing1 board of directors is scheduled to hold the last meeting of Its one-year term tonight In the cabi net room of the New Wlllard. Senator Ransdell will preside, and will receive reports from the various directors. Three Seselons a Day.

Illustrated talks on rlvef and harbor Improvement work will be features of both night sessions during the conven tion. ? Keeping the Great Lakes Open. Present efforts on the part of the United States government, with the co operation of the Canadian government, to keep the great lakes open to navi gation in order to facilitate the move ment of crops is referred to In a state ment issued by Senator Ransdell of Louisiana, president of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, as an ar gument for the need of an Inland sys tem of waterways. "The great lakes system is practical ly our only developed waterway." says the statement, "yet. important as it is. It does not allow direct shipmnets of grain to our ocean ports and. In addi tion. is closed by ice for several months of the year. The Department of Com merce evidently appreciates the fact that the more grain left in the great lake region at the close of navigation the greater will be the strain imposed on the railroads, which are already so overburdened that serious difficulties have arisen. Economic Principle Discussed. "In view, therefore, of the transcend ent economic Importance of a means of moving crops from the west to the east, the need for economy In federal appropriations which is accentuated by the extraordinary requirements of the defense program should not be permit ted to cause a serious curtailment of expenditures necessary to develop the rivers and harbors ,of the country.
