MCARAGUAN AFFAIR. The Nicaraguan Congress 1s to me at Managua, the capital of the repub lic, and events will soon show wheth er Zelaya is to continue to rle the country, or whether General Irias ia the coming man. Reports are coaV ilicting and are really worthless. Es trada's efforts are directed against Ze laya, but whom the revolutionary leader favors for president I not known. He may favor himself. From all the- evidence that has come to hand it appears that Leonard Grace was a colonel of engineers and I.tsroy -Cannon a lieutenant-colonel ift that branch of the revolutionary er vice, and that they were captured I outposts after a battle and held a prisoners of war. It is claimed that under the laws of Nicaragua Presi dent Zelaya had no right to execute these two Americans, The questions raised by Secretary of State Knox in- volve difficult constructions of Inter national law,and Mr. Knox very prop, erly desires to keep within that law and to be consistent himself through out. -' " '' - Possibly Zelaya will be driven out of Nicaragua In the near future, and then all the problems that have arisen, the "execution" of Grace and Cannon will speedily be adjusted. The Presi dent and Secretary of State are acting firmly but cautiously, and they do not propose to make a record In Nicara- gua that would be discreditable to this country in any respect. Any day's news may change the sit uation, and the reader who has be come interested in the subject ehouXd study the news eelWEsea. . 

CA1TN0 JT JLJTD THE WOKK OF CONGRESS. On Monday next Congress will meet and the wise ones are striving to as certain what Mr. Cannon's program is, what the insurgents will strive to do to the rules of the House, and what role of President Taft will be in message and throughout the eom- session. Disguise the battle as we may, it Is the old one between the many and the few between the consumers and the monoplies and trusts. "Wall street is apprehensive. It seems to think that! a radical message is to be piled on top of the decision in the Standard Oil case, and the prices of securities are not as firm as they were before the President started on his long tour to the Pacific coast. The general belief now is that the President will await the decision of the Supreme Court in the Standard Oil case before making any material sug gestions of changes in the "Sherman anti-trust act. It is believed that the decision of the Circuit Court has tied up such suggestions. The question of party unity Is no doubt duiv considered at the White House. The insurgents have declared I war against Cannon and the Houss rules, and at Kansas City the Speaker accepted the challenge in these words- "Ever since history began the man in the minority has been seeking some device by which he could overcome the will of the majority, and we. have a popular, if not absolutely reliable record of one celebrated character, an- tedating history whose fiat was, "Bet ter to reign in hell than to serve ii heaven." There was our first greai Insurgent, and he was pitched ovei the battlements of heaven. Since the creation of man there have been those at work on earth to encourage insur rection against order, which is- hea ven's law." This brings up an interesting ques tion as to Mr. Taft. The Speaker pro poses to tame the lions in his charge. He is ready for the contest. So are the insurgents. Some think the Presi dent will endeavor to utilize the strife by asking both the reactionaries and the insurgents in the party to support his administration measures. Neither side may care to oppose the adminis tration under ,he circumstances, and Air. Taft may prove a winner from the strife that has sprung up in the party.

LIBRARY ASSOCIATION MEETS IN FIFTH ANNUAL SESSION IN THIS Representative Attendance ary Centres of the State: Last Night and " Todays Sessions Replete with Effec tive Work: New Officers ' Elected For the En suing Year. Daily Argus, Friday. The North Carolina library Asso ciation convened in this city yesterday afternoon, under the auspices of the Goldsboro Public Library, and in the Woman's Club rooms, by courtesy of tnat public-spirited organization that has done so much for Goldsboro's up lift, and wearies not in well-doing. The afternooji session was devoted to formal routine business, such as reading of minutes of last annual meeting, reports of officers and com mittees, and the appointment j com mittees. - At 8:30 o'clock last night a most interesting, entertaining and instruc tive program was inaugurated, and every moment of the entire evening was one of unalloyed enjoyment alike for the delegates and the large and elite audience. The evening's program opened with a delightful solo by Mrs. Wms. Spicer. Then Col. Jos. E. Robinson, for the local Library Association, welcomed the delegates of the State Association, and the response on the part o? the State Association was made in well chosen words and cordial manner" by Mr. J. P. Breedlove, librarian of Trin .ty College. Miss Pearl Brinson, with her sister Mis Hattie as piano accompanist, then sang a solo of infinite sweetness. Miss Annie Petty, of Greensboro. the State president, who was presid ing, then presented Mrs. Annie S Ross, of Charlotte, who in most charming manner presented Mr. W. C. Jackson, professor of history at the Greensboro State Normal, who fron. his first utterance to his thrilling close held his audience spell-bouna, and as we are fortunate enough to o able to give the full text of his address tuy attempt on our part to laud i would be like endeavoring to "pain the lily or gild refined gold." Hv spoke as follows: . Madame President, Members of tht North Carolina Library Association Ladies and Gentlemen: It iB a diflicult thing for an outsidei to say anything of value to people en gaged in a special "calling or profet sion. My presence here this evening therefore, is not due to my knowlecio of any of the technicalities of youi calling storing, cataloging, binding distributing books; dealing with trus tees, patrons, clubs, and the commun. ty at large but it is due solely to u: fact that 1 am an appreciative ou. sider that I am one of a large nuu oer of the beneficiaries of your pa. ronage, ana tnat as a layman i ai iiere to bear testimony to your distil guished services, and discuss with yo tiTe character of this institution," wiik. means so much to us all. The modern library is a new facte-1 our civilization, i can scarcei .Agree with Profossor Trent that it ir one of the four institutions tnat ma. je fairly said to form the corners o. ;he foundation of modern civilizu tion." To say that it is on an equa footing with the church, the courts law.'and the school, is to place it, s yet, I believe, rather too high. Y would not underestimate its signiL cance. Its growth In recent years i nothing less than marvelous. - Th. first free library in this country wat. opened in Boston in 1852.
