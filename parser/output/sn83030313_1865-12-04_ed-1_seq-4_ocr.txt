General Eacobedo enjoys the confidence of bis subordinates, and our correnpoaaent regards him ai fully worthy of it; but Cortina, of whom we hear so much, is not regarded in as favorable a light. The so-called camp of the army con tained not a single tent, and presented not a very favor able appearance in a sanitary [>olnt of view; but the work* were tolerably well constructed and mounted. Our BrownM'ille correspondent also furnishes copies of the correspondence which recently passed between General Writzel and the impori&l officers at Matamoros iu reference to the complaints of the latter that one of tlieir gunboats in the Rio Grande was fired on from the Texas bunk, and that the Mexican republicans received aid and comfort from American soldiers. Be likewise again assures us that the craft which was lately the ob ject of such a furious night attack by the vessels and batteries of the imperialists, under the belier on their part that It was some Infernal Invention or the republi cans to blow them ap, was merely an American wood boat which got adrift in the river. We have had several flaming imperial accounts of this a flair, in which It was asserted that a number of republicans were killed and wounded. Our otty election will take place to-morrow, when the voters will be required to choose a Mayor, Corporation Counsel, eight Aldermen, twenty-four Councllmen, and School Commissioners and Trustees, making altogether aixty-thrco different officers to be elected Much inter esting information regarding the doings at the various political headquarters, the chance* of the different can didates, the opinious entertained of their respective merits and the plans and movements of the party leaders will be found both in our news and advertising columns. We also give a Hst of the polling places throughout the city. Mr. John W. Farmer has withdrawn from the Mayoralty canvass, and urges his friends to support Mar shall O. Roberts. There still remain before the people four candidates for Mayor? Messrs. Roberts, Hoffman, Gunther and Hecker. Some idea of the extent of the intorest felt in our city election throughout the State, by the Executive and other officials at the State capital, and even by the ad ministration at Washington, may be gathered from our Albany correspondence. The discussion in regard to the Mayoralty has already elicited practical propositions for the abolition by tlio legislature of the corporation de partments. and the organization of a now fiscal govern ment for tho metropolis. The promised removals t>y the Governor will probably not be brought to n head until he sends in his message to the Legislature at its opening. In the Hkrai.h of the '2011 1 ult. was published a letter of one or our correspondents from the little Swiss village of Fourneaux. descriptive of the railway tunnel now being bond through t ie Alps, and In this morning's issue we give a continuation of his chronicle of observa tion*, taken on the other side of tho mountains, and written at Bardonneche, in the valley of tho Dora. Fur ther interesting particulars are given regarding the pro gress of the worn and the advantages of compressed air, which is here exclusively ns^d, as the motive power for piercing the solid rock. Those having charge of operations on the tunnel anticipate its completion through its entire length of about seven miles and a hall by the close of the year 1808. According to tho Toronto LtmUr. General Mlchol, Ad ministrator of Canada, has be in informed of the contents of the i?uj>er9 seized on the Head Centre of the Fenians in Ireland, and this, it states, hi the reason why the riflemen, numbering about six hundred, have been con centrated at Isle ait Xoix, to bo ready for any attempt of tho Fenians by way of lake Chaniplaln. An address was issued by the late Fonian State Con vention in California to the Irishmen in the 1'aeiflc States, in wh eh they are urgently called upon to con tribute of their strength and means towards the straggle for the independence of Ireland and tbe establishment of the Irish republic. "The die is cast," the address, proclaims, '-and, come weal or woe, we must abide tbe hazard.'' Irishmen are requested, wherever there are tea of them who can meet together, to form a c:rcl-, and give their Influence and material aid to the effort which, they are informed, will assuredly be made to free their native land. Detectives Wonderi-y and Latlnvllle, of the Forty-fourth precinct oi the Metropolitan police, arrived in Brooklyn from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, early yesterday morning, bavin* in custody Charles Contby, alius Merrier, bus peel I'd of being the other man engaged with Gonzales and Salvador, alius Mlieer, in tho murder of Mr. Otero. Merclor was traced by the detectives from this city, he having enlisted in tho army here and been sent to Car lisle 1/arracks, where he waa arrested. He is now at the Forty-foitrth precinct station house, in Brooklyn, await ing an examination. If he is proved tnnocont ho will be returned to bis regiment in Carlisle.

At the conclusion of the sermon a report oT tho amount or funds received for missionary purposes dnnug the past year was rood, and It was announced that nearly four thousand dollars remained in the hands or i he treasurer. The Rev. Mr. Stephenson, rector of St. George's Mis sion chapel on Nineteenth street, wa? ordained priest yesterduy by th i Rev.

The forty-ninth anniversary of the Macdougal street Baptist church wa? celebrated in the church building laFt evening, the exercises consisting principally of addresses by several gentlemen and singing by the scholars. A tire was discovered early yesterday morn ng in the shoe store ltto Division street, kept by John Rosenblatt, hut was extinguished after doing a small amount of dam age. The flames and smoke cut ofl tho egrrss ot the tenants on the upjier floors, compelling them to jump from the windows, and some or litem had narrow escapes. The circumstances conneeted with the lire appearing suspi cious, Rosenblatt was arrested and held for an exatnina tion, which will take place to-day. A supposed Incendiary fire occurred about one o'clock ye-tcrduy morning In a stable at lf?& Christopher street, and extended to an adjoining building, both of which were partially destroyed. Thk Am.ArsE at thk Uoppkbhkab Mketino.? Whon tbe name of Robert K. Lee, recently the lender of the rebel army, was mentioned by a speaker at tbe Cooper Institute meeting on Haturday evening It was received with vigor ous cheers. Mr. Lee is now in charge of a little college in Virginia, nnd obviously these cheers were not called forth by anything con nected with bis present position. Neither were they occasioned by liny admiration or his personal character; for. although we believe him to be an aminhle gentleman, there is nothing in this fact, to recommend him to tbe especial plaudits of the Northern copperhead faction. Evidently, then, Mr. Lee wa? ehcercd by the secession is' s in the audience because lie bad been a rebel ami had done his utmost to de stroy the Union. Fuch cheers were not only in the worst possible taste, but tbey were In direct antagonism to the Union sentiment of this great city, and an insult to the brave Union ao Idlers wbo have survived tbe war, and to the relatives and friends of those heroea wbo died for the conntry at the hands of Mr. Leo'a forces. It la impossible, therefore, to pnsa over such an absurd, foolish and nnpatriotie de monstration without administering to the silly oopperheads concerned in it rebuke tbev so riohlv deserve. The Meeting ot Congrcu?A Radical Re publican Programme. Tbe two houses of the Thirty-ninth Congress (first session) assemble in the national Capitol at twelve o'clock to-day. As our ruaders will hare seen from our issue of yesterday, the re publicans, in a joint caucus of the House and Senate on Saturday night, agreed upon their programme of organisation, and this pro gramme will, in all probability, be put into practice to-day. It involves tbe re-election of Mr. Colfax as Speaker, and Mr. McPheraon as Clerk, with the total exclusion by the latter, in his preliminary roll, of the members elect from the late insurgent States, and their exclusion by the House itself. The first proceeding of this caucus, after tbe election of a chairman and secretary, was the appointment of a committee of seven, consist ing of Messrs. Stevens, of Pennsylvania; Ray mond, of New York; Spalding, of Ohio; Wash burne, of Hlinois; Payne, of Wisconsin; Bout well, of Massachusetts, and Blair, of Maine? a radical committee, from which, already out and dried by Thaddeus Stevens, a resolution was presented which at once, for at least a twelve month, If adopted by the two houses, disposes of the excluded Southern States. This resolu tion provides that, after tbe organization of the two houses, a joint committee, of fifteen more i members of the House and six of the Senate, j "shall be appointed to inquire into the condi tion of the States which formed the so-called Confederate States of America, and report whether they, or any of them, are entitled to be represented in either house of Congress, with leave to report at any time by bill or otherwise; and until such report shall have been made, and finally acted on by Congress, no member Hhall be received into either house from any of the so-called Confederate States, and all papers relating to the representatives from said States shall be referred to said com mittee without debute." This is the programme, and this radical reso lution in the caucus was adopted without a dissenting voice. It will, we infer, unless arrested by wiser counsels, be adopted in both branches to-day, and in tbe House on motion of Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, who thus, from the start, takes his position 88 lender of tbe body. His plan of operations, therefore, is open to the broadest radical interpretation. First, it ex cludes from Congress for an indefinite time every member elected to either house from Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Tennessee- ? eleven States. They are- to stay out, all of them, until this joint com mittee of fifteen shall have finished its investi gation, agreed upon Us plan and made its report, and thence until that report shall have been adopted and shaped into a law of Con gress. That this business, if entered into nnder the leading of Stevens, will occupy the two ho oseft far the next six months, or more, there Is every reason to believe. Furthermore, to make their eowrseof action decisive-, tro member from any of these excluded States elected to either house is to be admitted while this joint committee is engaged in batching its radical eggs of reconstruction, and all papers relating to the election of members from the excluded States are to be handed over to this joint committee, and without debate. All tbe work dnno in the way of reconstruction nnder tbe auspices of President Johnson goes for nothing,, except as the work ot raw apprentices beginning to learn their trade- Eleven States of tbe Union, disorganised, helpless and ex hausted by the war, are anxiously awaiting their restoration to established l*w and order, so that confidence and industry may be revived within their borders, and yet not only are Hie doom ot Congress to- be slmt In their feces, but they are to be put in the exclusive keeping of a joint committee of fifteen for consideration, and with a carte blanche in regard to time. If this islto be the game of tbe republican party let them look well to the ground on which they stand. We hold that the late rebellion* States, hav ing laid down their arms and submitted to the Hovereign authority el the Union, should be readmitted into Congress without unnecessary delay. The general government is imperfect without them, and their restoration ribould take the precedence over all other business. The members elect presenting themselves from the Southern States, if not admitted by the Clerk, should be admitted by tbe House, subject to an investigation of their qualifica tions, as in other questionable cases. The sweeping action of the republican caucus evi dently rests upon the fundamental error that the States directly concerned are out of the Union, and subject to Congress as Territories, and not as States; as Territories conquered from a foreign enemy, not as States in the Union all the time, but just released from an Indirection. The republican caucus has thus placed itself on the side of the radical and revolutionary programme of Thaddeus Ste vens and Senator Sumner, in opposition to the wise and conservative restoration policy of President Johnson. What ia contemplated by this programme of the radical Thaddeus Stevens? Hp ha? de clared himself, without reserve, in favor of the enforcement of a system of confiscations In the South an sweeping aa those of Willium, the Norman freebooter. Ilia plea ia, that auch con fiscations are needed to pay off the national debt. We cannot donbt, however, that the ex periment would be followed by political anar chy, financial confusion and repudiation. With the merciless inclinations of Mr. Stevens upon this subject, radical abolition fa natic an he is, we may gnens tLat the bill of his committee of fifteen for the recon struction of the late slave Stntes will be so stringent nnd exacting in regard to their eman cipated blacks aa to delay through all this Congress of two years the work of reconstruc tion proposed. Thus, from the continuance of the present unsettled condition of the South, the country nnd the Treasury, from the con tinued prohtrufion of Southern industry, will low hundreds of millions in substantial wealth which otherwise might be gained. President Johnson's policy looks to the de velopment of the vaat commercial resources of the South, for the purposes of local harmony, prosperity, law and order, and for the strength ening of the national Treasury. The policy of the republican caucus leads to the continued prostration of Southern industry, law and order, with the inevitable consequences of heavy lossea in Southern products, and increased burdens npon the Northern States. Finally, this impe rious Congressional caucus mensces the Execu tive with a revolutionary system of reconstruct ' tion, agaiuot which he mav orotest, aud thus I carry the \mxe before the North in Ihe elec t U of next fall for the next Congresa. bocn an issue, if guided by wine counsels, the Boa# of Representatives, in its proceedings to-aay, will avoid: bat we confess that Tbaddens t?te vens wems to hold the majority in his grasp. The whole case to involved in this caucus reso lution. Tl?e P#*sldei??'? ???? P?!*?* To-day o? to-morrow we shall probably have the usual official declaration of the domestic and foreign policy of the government in the President's message to Congress. No similar document since the foundation ot the govern ment ever excited more attention than thfawffl, or ever treated of questions mote important. The people everywhere, from ti>e Atl*ntic t0 the Pacific, and from Matae to the > Gidf of Mexico, will watch with deep i*t?* throbbing of the telegraph as it conveys the words of the ohief af the nation. The subject of paramount importance, m?d the one on which the President tmdoubtefiy wiH speak more tally than on any other, fa that of the restoration of the Southern States. Judg ing from his action in thfa matter up to the present time, and from his different proclama tions. letters of instructions and conversations on the subject, we cannot be at a loss to per ceive what the tenor of his language and recom mendations will be. First of all he wffl no doubt recommend the earliest restoration of these States to their normal condition in the Union. Be to opposed to the infliction of un necessary or retributive penalties, and doea not wish to exact anything more than is neces sary to give us security for the ftiture. Like a Bkillul physician, he would heal the wounds that have been made, by timely aPPhcftU^ ?nd restoratives, before they gangrene and he patient becomes exhausted. Believing he Southern people valuable to the body politic now that they are cured of their heresies, and that thev and their rioh section of the country cannot 'be kept down by severe or vin dictive measure, without bringing incalcu lable evils upon the whole country, he wants to see them restored. In other words, he wants to see the rebellion closed up as noon as possible; and this cannot be so long as the States remain unrepresented in Congress and disabilities are imposed upon the people. The President believes it to be the part of true statesmanship, as well as oi humanity and phi losophy, to preserve the manhood of these people, and not to- humiliate or depress them unnecessarily . It fa only in that way we can obtain permanent peace at home and proper respect abroad. That is the course to bring harmony between the different sections, to save us from financial difficulties, to develop the resources of the country, to pay the national debt and to make us the most un^jmd greatest people i? the world. A different course will lead to anarchy, financial trouble and the desolation * the fairest country on the face or the globe. Such, we believe are sub Htantiallv the views of President Johnson, and snch we think we may expect to see expressed In hfa message. ? The whole domestic policy of the President H based*on broad, conservative and statesman like views, and It Is to be hoped that Congress Z act in harmony with him. The first pro ceedings of the radical republican members at Washington and the somersaults of a portion of the republican press do not autcur very favorably for such harmony; but when we con sider that these radicals were first on the ground, and are in the habit of making a great aotoe for the sake of effect, we do not think there is any great reason tor alarm. e ope and think the conservative portion ot Congress will be strongest, and will sustain the Presi dent Should we be disappointed in this, how ever, we do not doubt Mr. Johnson will rema n firm to his principles and policy, and that to the end the people will come to the rescue and overwhelm his opponents. With regard to onr foreign relations, and particularly as to the Mexican question, we Ruppose the Pmriftent will speak very plainly, and enunciate such a broad American polioy as becomes the power and dignity of the country. IT he should not deem it expedient to enter specifically into' details of the acts of foreign governments on and relative to this continent, we doubt not he will be very clear, leaving nothing to be misunderstood, as to the prin ciples involved and the views of the govern* ment. The qucstie* of our national finances will be treated, we imagine, with the caution- such a delicate subject requires. The desire and pur pose to retnrn to specie payments will be qualified, we hope, by recommendations to tnkc such steps as may not cause a monetary crisis or seriously derange commerce aud the revenue. If the above should be the programme of the administration, as we supnose it will, and Con gress should aid in carrying it out, as that body ought, our troubles will have culminated, aud we shall enter at once upon a fresh career of unexampled prosperity and glory. A few hours will tell us the views o ( the President, and in a few days we shall know what the course of Congress will be with regard to them. 1 he time is pregnant with mighty issues, and the people wait anxiously the result. Thk Fukntw in Mexico ? AFibe in Tnr. Rear.? The news that the French have retreated from Chihuahua and Sinaloa, abandoning the whole of both those States to the republicans, and that the imperiul troops at Matntnoros are so pressed that it has been found necessary to reinforce them, certainly does not look as if the friends of the Mexioan republic noed despair for her cause. The United States Minister to the republic will now find President Juarez In better accommodations than any that were possible at El Paso. If the public should find in President John son's message two or three vigorous American sentences on this subject, the prospects of the liberal cause will bo far brighter than they have been for many months. Rut these sen tences must not be of the doubtful kind spoken ol in the London account of Mr. Seward'a remonstrance. The country docs not want to protest against Franco's Bending troops here because they are negroes; It would rather pro test against negroes because they are troops. It does not want quibble* and diplomatic dodges. It wants a broad, open, bold declara tion against Franc^ because she has violated in the most outrageous and impudent manner a policy cherilhed by our government and ap proved by the people. It Is worthy of notice as one more fact in fnvor of the liberals that the French occupa tion is likelr soon to recelre a severe fire iu the rear. By our news from Paris ft appears that the opposition in the French Legislature is determined to make a savage onslaught against that part of the conduct of the govern ment The opposition view is, that as Maxi milian has declared the revolution euded and the country pacified, and has selected an heir to his throne, and is about establishing a national theatre in Mexico after the model of tie Comedie Fraucaise, he cannot possibly need French aid any longer, and their purpose is to protest against any further support of his empire. The War >? Chllr-Npaln in Danger. The Spanish blockade of the Chilean coast has recently undergone a material change. It is now declared to be only against six ports. This is because (he Spanish admiral bos only six ships. His blockade of a whole' coast with six men-of-war was so manifestly a mere paper blockade that no nation could be required to respect it as effective^ and if under sucb cir cumstances, he had seized the ships of any maritime Power, Spain would probably have gotten into trouble with somebody stronger than Chile. Sej lest his whole blockade should be invalid, Admiral Pareja restricts it to six principal ports. But even this blockade of one ship to a port must be fur from effective. The limitation of the blockade does not improve the state of affairs for commerce, as the six ports (Talcahuanoj Tomi, Valparaiso, Coquimbo, Heradma and Caldera) are those from which ?R the foreign trade is carried on. The British press, therefore, will not roar any less against Spain on account of this change. It will sot apparently reduce tiie price of copper. The arrogance, the disregard of all sense of right and justice, with which Spain has rushed into this Chilean quarrel shows that the old maxim still has its application to the conduct of nations ? "Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad." Spain's last, and perhaps best, foothold of dominion on this continent was already in danger. Cuba, so manifestly ours by all natural laws, was growing rapidly into the circle of the States by all the processes of inter-communication and trade. Perhaps the fact that Cuba is the last home of slavery in our neighborhood, coupled with the reluc tance of our people to see European nations bold slaves at our doors when we have our selves refused, at such terrible cost, to hold them>? perhaps these considerations would have soon enough deprived Spain of that fair possession. It was her part, therefore, to move softly in this troubled hemisphere; to let us for get her presence here if possible; to avoid all complication that brought her up in any light antagonistic to the rights of others; but she has fbrgotten or scorned that wise course-, and must take the consequences. Europeun politicians often take a short sighted view of the possible consequence of their acts. We have seen this once strangely illustrated1 In the late history of Italy. The Emperor of France, urging on the King of Sap diniav never seems to have considered how far the- events he started might go. He never dreamed of all Italy rising into one grand unity, and if he had he would have left Italy to her former political insignificance. It will prove that a similar mistake has been' made by Spain in< inviting war in America. It will go> farther than she thought. With whatever idea it started? whether Spain is only a catspaw to pull some one else's chestnuts out of the fire, or whether she is In South America to divide the attention we ought to give to Mexico ? it matters not, the conseqnenoe must eventually be to> drive- her out of this hemisphere.

The handiwork of Providence baa never been inure signally displayed' than' in the discovery, by the oIHocps engaged in the caee, of nearly every eir curastanre eennected with) It. The murder of a foreigner and stranger, committed under the cloak of darknesa, in a spot which- the assassins thought wm the Attest for their fell purpose, lonely and unfrequented, was knows to the pollen; and the body discovered by ex-police man Mills and detective Wonderljr in an hour after It bad taken place. The appacenily trilling clue of a pair of blood stained- gloves l<-d to- the arrest of Polllcer, and his confession io.that of OonoaJes. llut tbo straniseat feature in the entire matter is the capture of the ttiinl party spoken of by Pellicer and (tonzalo* from the meagre clue of his signature Detective Wonderlv went to work on Monday la?t to ??t on the track of this party. He visited the Barcelona otei in cumpuny with officer Lntinville, who wa* de tailed by Captain Waddv teas.-ist him. Her* they mad* Inquiries shout this supposed accomplice of (Sonnalea, and were shown bis signature. He had been out of em ployment for some time and had left his address at the hotel. TUe name he gave wna Charles Com by. They also obtained bis description from tlie bookkeeper, Mr. itampsony, as a frenchman, aged twenty ii va years, alHMit live foet eleven inches (a height, and very stoolfy built. The detectives procured the slip of paper on which his signature wan written, and s written statement made by the bookkeeper to the effect that this Comby came to work at the Barcelona Hotel some time ago. He was discharged far interfering with the boarders, and on the morning of the 224 of November he was seen talk ing to ('ontalcs. Ob the day after the murder he came to the Barcelona H'ltei and asked the bookkeeper whither he could see the gentlemsn In room 2A, which was Otero's room. Mr. 8ainp*ony told him that be ought to know what bad happened to Mr. Otero, and charged him with being concerned In the murder. The man got very much excited, and instantly loft the hotel before an officer could be procured. The detectives as certained also that Comby had attempted to ship In the merchant sen Ice Irt No. 107 Cherry street ; but they found there that he had not ship|M?d. They then went to the army recruiting office In Jay street, and were Informed that do man by the name of Comby bad en listed there. They requested of the officer la charge to show them the descriptive list of the men ou listed for the past few days. On this ll?t they found a signature, Chsrtes Merrier, snd at once detected Comby'* hsnd writing. The description on the list tallied exactly with that or Cumhy given thia bjr tho bookkeeper of the lturrelona Hotel The nelnnorning they were Informed that this Charles Merrier was sent to Carlisle Barracks, Pa., and atartod immediately after him. On arriving at the barracks they bad an Interview with Colonel Royal, commandant of the post, and stated their business. The man was sent for snd brought Into the Colonel's room. The officers arrested him immediately, and the Colonel delivered him up to them with the understanding that be f wug to bo returned ir he was not found guilty of the murder. Comby stoutly denied nil knowledge of the | crime of which he was accused, but admitted that he i was acquainted with Otero and (Jonwtler. He was hand cuff" d and brought Into Carlisle. The detectives with their uame then started by the twa o'clock train Irom i Carlisle on Saturday, for Harrl'buni, and conllned their : prisoner In the City Hall there until the r|Kht o'clock | train brought them on to New York. They arriv><d at i the Forty fourth precinct station house at veven o olocU yesterday morning, snd delivered the parly they were sent in pursuit of up to Captain Waddv. At the station house Comby become greatly agitated and hurst into tears, but still denied all complicity In ibe murder Thus w.thln n ne days from the night of the murder all the parties on whom suspicion rusts as heln* g-illtv of the death of the uniorttmato Hpanlaid have been delivered into the hands of Justice. Captain Wsdriy, who ba? worked with commendable zeal thronffbout ihls ca-te, placed the pursuit of the third party (Comby) entirely In dclcctivo Wondcriy's hands. Whether be Is Ibe party really guilty of Ilia murder or not is a question for the Crand Jury to decide ; b.,t at nil events he is the Kreerhmnn spoken of at the Coron 'r's Inquest as the companion of Courales on the morning previous lo the murder, snd the highest credit is due to Captain Wnddy, detective Wondcrly and officer ljitinville for tracing aud arresting him Accident an the Cap* May Railroad.
