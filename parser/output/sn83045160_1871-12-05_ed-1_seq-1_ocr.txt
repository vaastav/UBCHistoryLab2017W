The early action of Congress In this recommendation would put IS in the power of the War Department lo place a force in the field during the aummer. The resumption of diplomatic relations be-as.-een FRANCE AND GERMANY has enabled me to give directions for the with drawal of the protection xtended to Ger mans lc t rsnoe by the diplomatic andoon suisr represeu:atlve of the United Slates In that country. Il is Just to add that the deli cate duty of ihl- protection has been per form d by t :e Minister and the Consul Gen eral at ParH and tb various consuls in France under the supervision oi the latter with great kindness, as well as with prudence and tact. Their r.'-ii-e hue-received the commendation of tne German government, and has wounded no susceptibility of the French.

I recommend to congress lo provide, by stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the holding, owning or deal- property In foreign Ian as, either as owners, heirs or mortgages, by persons of the United States. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of THE ISLAND OF CUBA Continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety, me existence or a protracted snug gle in sucb cloee proximity to our own terrl- lory. without any api ;rnt Prosneci or an early tej-minatinn, cannot be other than an object of c m-ern to a people who, while aoslainlug from Interference in the affairs of other ioers, naturally uesire to see even country in the undisLurbed enjoyment of peace, noeriy, auu tne Msnta or rree institu tions. Our naval commanders In Cuban water have been instructed. In ctse It should become ncoe4ary, ' o spare no eflort to protect the lives and property of bonaflile American ci'ireus, and to maintain the dignity of the flag.

MODI KiCATlON W BOTH TARIFF AND IsTf-RS fl L TAX laws. I recommend that all taxes from Inter nal resources be aboiiMnsi. ex cent those on spirit uous,vinous and malt llqaorsand iobacco in Its various forms from stamps. In lead lust ng the tariff, I suggest that a careful esti- uiaTe oe mao oi tne arnouni or i-urpius reve nue coiJectetl under tbe preaent laws, after providing foT the cut rent expenses of the gov ernment, i he iniet account and ;a sinking fund, and that tin- a- 9 surplus be reduced in such a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many ar ticles not produced at home, such as medicine and oompouuded es-enaea, from which very little revenue is deriv!, hut which enter Into general Cass. All such articles I re commend to be placed on the free Hat. If a further reduction piove advisable, I would then r commend that It be made on those ar ticles which can, without disturbing home production or reducing the waesol American labor. I have not entered into' figures, because to do so would be to repeat all that haa been lata before you In the report of the secretary of the Ueasury. The present laws for collect ing the revenue pay collectors of customs small aalailcs, hut piovide for shares in all seizure ; which, a( thf- principal ports of en try particula ly, raiafl Ihe compensation of these officials to hvge sums, it has always seemed to me as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out an Induce ment to 

DISHONEST MEN, should such get possession of these offices, to be too lax lu their scrutiny of the goods entered enable them finally to make large seisures. Your attention is respectfully in vited to this subject. The continued fluctuation In the value cf Sjld, aa compared with tbe national currency, aa a most damaging effect upon the Increase and development of the country in keeping up the prices of all articles necessary in every day life. It fosters a SPIRIT OF ORUMBLINO at the national finances If tbe question can be met as to how to get a fixed value to our r.urrency that value constantly and uni formly appioacbiug par with specie a tery deftrable object will be gained. k'ot the operatious of THE ARMY In the past year" 1 he expense of maintaining the estimates for ths ensuing year, and for contlnu ng seacoaet aud other Improvements conducted under the supervision of the war department, 1 refer you to the acoomiulug report of the secretary of war. I call your at tention to the provisions of the aet of con gress, approved Match , 1W. which discon tinues promotion in the stall corps of the army until provided lor by law. 1 recommend that the number of officers in each grade of the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number In any one grade falls below ibe num ber so fixed, bat 4 he vacancy may be filled by promotion frm tbe grade below. I also re commend that wheu the office of chief of a eoips becomes vacant, the place maybe filled by selection-from me corps in which tbe vacancy exists, me rs- jori oi uie secreisry oi THE NAVT shows an Improvement In the number and efficiency oi the naval force, without material increase in the expense of supporting lt This is due lo the policy which has been adopted, and is being extended ss fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By these means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of crnialug ground, to visit more flrsqiienliy our flag as is desirable, and general to aisonarge emcienuy toe appropriate dutiea of the navy In time of peace without exceeding the numoer of men or the expen diture authorized by law. During the past year this navy has, lu addition hi its regulsr .service, supplied lh men and officers for the vesseis of tue coast survey, and has completed the surveys as suth- nxod by Congress of the Isthmus vf Dane n and TEHl ANTEPEC, and under the same autb rliy has sent out an expedition completely furnished and equlppe 1 wexpioieme unanuwu ooeau 01 uie uuuu.

I sis j recommend that all promotions in the navy above captain be by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure, In the higher grades, greater efficiency. and hold out an In centive to young officers to lmprovs themselves In ths knowledge of their profes sion. Tbe present cost of maintaining ins na vy, as compared with that of the p races! -lug year, and the climates for the ensuing year, are contained In the accompanying re port of the secretary of the nary.

Sir The country has i een prosperous during the year now closing, and tue public finances have shared in ibe general prosperity. During the financial vear endlua June &u. 1571. the reduction of the public debt was S9,&7,7M M. ine to Lai users iu me punuc oaoi irom March 1, IWt, to December 1, 1871, was 57.;l.ly.iltj : and dur ux tne same period the annual interest has been reduced siu.TJi.lJO U4. THE REVENUE for the year ML and the receliia since the 1st of July last, show that the time has arrived wii n a coha:aeiauie iuriher reduction in laxu can be made, aad yet leave the government In a position to FAY ISO.COOiJOO ANNUALLY of ths principal of the debt. Including the amount pledged through the sinking fund. Iu my annual report to congress for 1H7U, I expressed the opinion thai KasS settled policy of tbe country should contemplate a revenue Lmic.eui io meet tue oruinary expenses or the governmeut, pay the interest r - the puhlu debt, and from twenty-five toMftv million dollars of the principal annually. To that opinion I adhere, aud express even A STRONGER CONVICTION, that the payment annually upon the princi pal of the public debt should not be less than jO.IW.UUO. Large ss the resources of the coun try have t,eou during tne ia--t three years, our system of TAXATION HAS NOT BEEN OPPRESSIVE to individuals, nor has It to any sensible de gree embarrassed ihe business oi the country, ane wune reuei rrom taxation is uesiraoie, u Is yet more desirable to maintain the nubile credit in lis present elevated position, not only as sn example to other nations, but for lb histories! vaiue In enabling tbe government to make loans for large amount upon favora- oieie.uisw, uuuappiij , in uie luture an eai- geucy should require such loans to be made. The power to negotiate a large loan at five per com and enter upon uegotlatious for the said of bonds drawing five, four and a half and four per ceut. interest Is derived entirely from the exhibition of AN 

H0NE3T PURPOSE. on the part of the people to maintain the pub lic faith, anu the consequent ability on the part of ihe government to eflect loans for that expectation by large and frequent payments upon the public debt. THE REVENUE FROM CUSTOMS for the year 171 was greatly in excess of the estimates, amounting to sVUb,370,4OJ 04, against shMxl ,374 44 for the preceding ear ; the coat ol collecting this revenue Wua 16 4,067.251 for IsTl, bet a A 11-lw per ctnt., whiU- the cost lor tb. year 1670 was e.i7,l T. 25, or exceeding 20-loo rr cent tue appropriations tor tne conec- f custom less addi ions derived from fines a'.tftisenaltiea aud forfelturea, exceeded the expeViiture by the sum of more than S-xio,000, and there is no doubt that the permanent ap- pfonnation win oe ample Bur tbe present year ana for the next fiscal year.

In the sugges tions I bave the hon-jr to make la reference te the reduction ol tu.es, I keep In view two portsnt racu-1 First That ths ability of the nation to pay sl least flfkV million-) annually of ths orin- cipal of ths public debt shall not beimpaiiad; niT Second That In this change of the revenue ayatem np violence bhaii be dons to the busi ness irrtereHi oi i ue couuiry. While 1 do not undertake to state precisely tbe causes which have contributed to the pub lic prosperity, there is no substantial reason for tiuestlonlng the truth of the statement that tbe last few years have been the most prosperous in the history ot the country years witboui an example In our own affairs and without a parallel In the affairs ot any othor government. It Is practicable lo dis pense with ail the revenue rrom internal source, except thst derived from stamps spirits, tobneco and malt liquors; these source should furnish for tbe years 1S72-3 a revenue of about OlUO.OUO.000, making a reduction Lh Late of fl0,ooOuo. Tne revenue from cus toms under tbe existing laws and from lands and miscellaneous sources would amount to about f .33JM),O.0 more, mak ing a total revenue of Is43,oo0,u0o. The ex penses of the government, not including tbe sinking fund, are estimated at 0279,026,773 ; if to tb yaum added 0jO,ouo 0 0 for payments on account of the public debt, including Ihe ainoum uue on me unsing iunu, iners rs maiua a balance of aboul fJUuO.uuO within which reductions may be made In the revenue from cuaunns. This amount, added lo the re duction proposed under the Internal revenue laws, give a total reduction or x,ouo,uoo. in his view 1 reanectfullv recommend to the consideration of congraa the reduction of tbe duiiu-s on sail io the oanw t or nve j.er ceni , tbe duty on nltumlnous coal to fifty cents per ton, the reduction of ihe duty on rawhides and skins, and the removal of all dutiea from a large clae of articles p oduoed In other countries which enter to the arts and rnanu f ciures f ihla country, and which are not produced in the United States, tne revenue rrom which is lucoii.-iaerahie. isuch a Uat, wltb the revenue derived from each article, is :n course of preparation and will he sub milted to Congress. Tbe removal of duties from a large cla of articles used In manufac tures; and the reduction of the duties upon coal, furnish an opportunity for amodsrate decrease in tbe rates of duties upon those pro ducts whose cost will be diminished by those changes, while nothing than the consequences of tbe legislation could be more d sastroua to the public prosperity a policy which would de troy or seriously disturb the manulactur inz Interests of the country. 4 is aul poastilsby wise and moderate changes, adapted to thecondltion of business ana isoor, u rtaoce me rates of duties with benefit to every cisas of people. The average PREMIUM ON GOLD for the year 1808 wsa St -64 per cent; for the jear 1669 it was 32 c0 per cent.; for the year 1X70 it was 4-63 per cent., and for the first eleven months of the year 1071 it was 13-1 par cams. The value of the PAPkR CURRENCY of the oeunLy during the years 1909 and 1170 apparently appreciated by tue lnc easeu use of paper moaty in the south, tut chiefly oy the establishment of tje eretiit ol tne United States upon a firm basis. On the 1st of January, 1871, the last-named tact was fully accomplished, and since thai time the appreclat on of the paper currency has been due wholly lo the increased demand tor It tn the business affairs of the country, ihe dlffereuce between the value of paper money at the present moment and iu value cn the 1st of December, Ij7o, may be attributed to me latter cau.-e, and furnishes the beat Tueaijs wh-ch the country has vet had for as certaining tbe quantity of paper currency wuicu cuu oe useu auu ius vaiue aept av par with gold. The resuli ot this teal concurs with what Keems to me lo be the beat opinion upon the aubjeel thai the amount of paper money in circulation is still so great that It cannot be maintained at par with gold coin. There are two modes of relief : rirst To reduce the volume of currency, as wab recommended by me lu my annusl reoort aubmltted lo cougreaa in December, laSu. Second To await the growth of the country ahd the increasing demands of business. inch, in time, will produce tbe deal red result. The chief means of securing the end souaht without a red.ctlon In the volume of cur rency, would be the use of paper money upon tbe Pacific coast. W lib. this object lu view, steps have a ready beeu taken by this depart ment for the purpose ef ascertaining whether it la D a!tlcabl to nUhstituLe Daner fur coin and I have reason to anticipate that a change viii oe ujaue in ine iew rejaung to nauouai banka tending to that result, ana which will not affect unfavorably the gene, al character of in? Hyiem. It is my duty to call the attention of con gress to the Importance of abolishing the aystem of ahaiea in moieties, as far as It oeheflte levenue officers and other persona officially connected with the government. This measure was recommended In my last annual report, and a statement was Buhmitied to congress showing the amount received by officera of c us turns, together with a bill in creasing their salaries without any increase of appropriations from the treasury, toe sum now paid from moieties being quite sufficient to place tbs en ire force upon a satisfactory footing in regard' to pay. During the last fiscal year the offlcea ot col lector and surveyor of the port of New York each received from moieties the sum of Jitfl.0 99, and the naval officer the sum of 04fl,llto 59, and, In most cases, the officers do not perform the special services entitling them to the amount granted ; aud importers and others, whose acts are made the subject of investigation, complain, and I think, with just reason, that the agents of the government have a pecuniary Interest in pur salug those charged with violations of the law. The government ought to pay fair Kala rlesand rely upon tbe good faith of its officers for the performance of their duties. One oi the difficulties which the department has to meet irequenuy is mat me custom ameers have an Interest in proceeding for the discov ery of fraud, In tbe settlement of cases, or tbe prosecution uf them, which is different from tbe real Interest of the government, an-, as a necessary result, the conduct of such officers la open to sust icl n, both on the part of those who are punished by them aud me goveru ment that they ostensibly represent. it ay be a coined ex peo leu t to leave -the law a it now stands In iegrd to informers who are not c IB era, making it a penal oi fense for any officer to enter Into any ar rangement wltn au informer for any share of tue proceeds nf the information, and giv ing to tne lurormer, a perpetual rigntoi ac tion for the recovery of any money or other valuable thins oaid or given to any officer engaged in tns discovery or prosecution of irauu, or legal wrong against me government.

The exterior walls remain, and the buiidina could be re pair Hi, but anticipating tbe growth of Chicago and the mag' itude or Its public business, I advise the erection of a building suited to the wants of a first-class uity. It La important that a much larger park of land should be obiaiued, elthwr bv addition to the present lot, or by the purchase of another ile. On the loth of October last I wrote a letter to Oovernor Palmer, ask In it him lo re commend to the legislature the psaaiage of an act granting authority to the courts of the state of Illinois to condemn such land might be required, in case the government should be unable to obtain it by purchase at a reesonaoie price payment to ne made upon an aijoralsal In everv eaaft. Th Kin, fur & building to be erected by the government for publ.c uses should be large enough to separate from ail other structure, thus furnishing suiuciem ugui ior tne prosecution or business and adequate security also against fire and uepruaations oi lawless persons. It is hardly necessary to say mat In the ex Istlng condition of affaire at Chicago, it is im portaul that au appropriation, available dur ing the present fiscal year, should be made without unnecessary delay. Since my ,ast aanuat report the supervising architect has completed the customhouse, courthouse and postoffice at Portland, Maine, the courthouse and postxjffice at DesMoines, Indiana, aud the courthouse and posteffice at Madison, Wisconsin, and the appraiser's stores at Philadelphia, aud the assay offi.ee at ti- City, Idaho. ft is now expected that the customhouse end postnmce at tot.

Woodworm has bean appointed bUPEBVISIUG 

BURGEON of the marine hospital servlea. Hie admin istration la satisfactory to tne department. The average number of hospital patients for the fleil year ending June tutu, 1870, was 1014, ard for tbe year ending June so, 1871, LUS. The total loss of the service for the fire.. THE EXPENDITURES year was MCo.flM, being an average for each parent of 41 uw per day, and for tbe latter year tasTsfles 42, or an average af $1 04 per day. In the first-named year the hospital tax was Sies. 13 7U, and in the latter year it amounted to Mas 14. The supervising surgeon la of the opinion that pavilion hoapltaia axe belter adapted to the successful treatment of the sick than the oidiuaiy buildings of brick aud stone, while the expenses are only one-fourth so gi eat. in accoruanoe wim his suaeeseion. 1 recom mend an apptoptlatlon of eou.WJU for the pur chase of laud aud the construe. lou of a pavil ion hospl al at Pittsburg. The present hospital s sjbuieu in tue vicinity oi iron mills end rail ay a, and as It can be sold tor 7u.uwi. me government will be fully reimbursed for the coat of me hospital, while the comfort of the paLients win be promoted. An estimate has oeen made that the sum of Lxi.uuu v, il be sufficient for the construction of a pavuua nop;tai ou Angel island, in the Bay of SaVFrauciaco. sufficient t.t accommo date onefiuudred snd fifty patients, and I also reoora mend an appropriation of that amouui fuf that purpose. 1 also gpect fully renew the recommenda tion made heretofore for a pavilion hospital near the cily of New York sufficient for the accommodation uf tw I bundred patieuts. x i. xa-c v r. j r jiarvi.s r. oivxv ica employs twenty-five steam vessels and eight sailing esMCia. iu sumnuu to luese iners are two large steamers upon the lakes not in commission, and two schooners upon the coast condemned as not flt for dutv. Of ths six larger steamers upon ihe lakes, four only are in commission, and as the others are not useuea i nave tue aonor to recommend mat authority he given for their sale. During the last ye-r lour iron steamers have been built, three of two hundred a d fifty tons each and one of three bundred and fifty tons burthen. Under the exietimz anDronriation of S2Uu,uuu the department is about to issue proposals for four small Iron propellers, two for the Pacific and two for the Atlantic coast. A torn st aporonriauon of s2UU.0uu is needed to eon l the department to carry into effect the ltajsninendatiou of tbe commissioner, whose report was approved by the department and submitted to congress ou tbe2eth of May, 1870. The plan 1 ecom mended by the com missioner, when fully adopted, will Beet a reduction in the expenses of this branch of the service of about louO.uuO, or bout 34 per cent, of the whole cost and the changes proposed contemplate ths use of ves sels oi leas tonnage, aud a consequent reduc tion of the nu cnuer of men employed. The expenses of the revenue marine service for the year ending June SO, 1&71, were ocly 16164 5e, against tl,lao,Aftj 31 for the pro ceeding year. The first quarter of the present uscai year snows a reiuciion in tbs expenses of 4bri-,,l4i, as compared with the correspond ing periou oi tne preceding year. Al the date of my last reoort a board of officers wss in session charged with the duty oi 

EXAMINING THE OFFICERS then In active service. The report showed that flvecaotains, five first-lleute nan ta, nine es-coud-liwu tenants and tea third-lieutenants were not qua.lfied for the duty. The persons found to be Incompetent have been discharged aud their place filled by promotion aad by the appointment of additional officers. Alter a competent examination there are several officers who, ou account ol their age, are unfit for duty. The supply of officers in their places and for the increase of tue numoer of engi neers rendered neccessry.br the substitu.lon of steam for sailing vessels, require additional appropriations for tbe next fiscal year. This branch of public .service la upon the whole in a satisfactory' condition. During the third session of the forty-first congress a bill was submitted for the organisa tion oi A MINT BUREAU. The bill passed the senate, but failed In the noose ox lepresentasivea, tuougn not, as l am Informed, from aav objection to me urincinlea upon which it was framed. I urgently recom- meuu me passage oi a similar dui at me present session of congress. Ail the mints and assay offices are nominally in charge of the treasury department, but there la not, by authority of Law, any person In the depart ment who, by virtue of his office, is supposed to be Informed upon the subject, and uo one on whom the secretary of me treasury can officially rely for ln'ormatlon or advice In the management uf this important branch of Puduc ousineea. It is est! in a led that the Internal com merce of ths country Is fifteen times as great as our external commerce, eat me statistics are untrustworthy or incomplete .and I res pectfully recommend that provision be made ior ootBxning snca re. urns ss win snow tout the trade ui the country upon those diverse canals, lakes and railways. The report of Mr. Charles Bryant, special agent, who has the full tmaigs ox the Islands of St. Paul and St. Geoigs, shows that business, haa been conducted by the AT.Aiaga 

COMMERCIAL COMPANY In substantial uniformity to the terms of tbe eon tract. Mr, Bryant suggests an appropri ation for the construction of a house upon each Island for the accommodation of the agents of the government, who, at present. are uepenuent upon vns company ior ooara and shelter, and although I am not aware that any evil has resulted from the arrange ment, it is manifest thst it ought not to oe entertained ; it Is estimated that an appropri ation of " AGO will be sufficient :or a suitable building on eaea island. the agents charged witu me management. of the BEAU FISHERY, have been detailed from the custom service. I resDectiullv recommend that authority be given for the appointment of two agents and WO assistant geuu, auu luat uiiauie appio prlaiions be made for their salaries and ex penses. The necessity of two agents for each island is apparent. Tbs agents will desire to return to the States aa often am once in two years, and moreover, It la whw for the govern ment to have not leas than four persons in Its employment connected with the care of the people and the hnsine of ths island. ssi- Drjautaisoiuas.es suggesLauus as w i ei ther provision for the CARE OF THE NAT! YES, which appear to me to deserve consideration, again cam nwuuuu ui uicw wo aut Imparlance of INCREASING THE SALARIES of the bureau officers and heads of division In the treasury department. At present there is great Inequality snd injustice existing. The first comptroller receives a salary of S-wN par year, while the second comptroller and other bureau officers, whose duties are hardly less important, only receive Ubuu. The solid tor of the weassmry la ones a asalary oifatho, while the aniiMtienf intern! revenue, whose duOes sea less lmportanti receives a salary of MtlUO.

It It with difficulty, that the former Is able to secure the lnadeouate sum of fifco'. The same remark mlvtiL. with truth, bs made of several bureau officers and of persons in the office of me treasurer of the United States In this connection, I also recommend an In crease of tsa aaiarv of the supervising sur geon of the marine hospiiais. I think it my duty to apeak of ths act creating the depart ment of justice, by which the solicitor of the treasury and the solicitor of the internal rev enue office are made officers of that depart ment. The proper and essential duty of the solicitors is to give advice to me secretary anu bureau officers upon questions wnicn arise lu me daily business oi me department. Under exUtlusr systems tbe attorney-gen era! La made nominally responsible, wnile tn tact ne ought to be exempt rrom an responsi bi lty for advice given by thes officers, that upon a reference to mm oi questions wnicu may have been nrevlouslv considered by them he may be free to advise or reverse their action. These officers should receive their aDDoinlments mroturh me treaaurv deoarv ment, and be responsible to Its head. It la a fundamental error in the administration lo place in any of the departments officers de riving their appointment from another de- partiuent. should me attorney -general trans ler these officers to the denartmesHof justice as It appears has been ooatsmpiated by the act, mis department would oe uepnveu sun stautlaily of their services. I earnestly reoom mend the res u rest an. of these offieers to their former poeltious mine treasury. THE
