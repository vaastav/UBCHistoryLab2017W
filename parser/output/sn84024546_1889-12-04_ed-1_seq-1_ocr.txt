The first vessel i.Vto leave 'Brazil since the revolution, whiph tihu reached the United States, arnyed,-at fthis port this morning. It was the steamer Portuguese, of the Bed Cross line. The steamer came to the agent, Shipton Green, .with a cargo of sugar and .rubber. She ibronght no passengers. She came from sv3W -'Pernambnco and Para, bringing the mail r'- and newspapers from those ports. She left Para on November 21, a week after the Be V public was declared. A Dispatch man had a talk to-day with Captain Frederick . -1Hews, of the Portuguese. Captain Hews said: H'ye ieft Pernambnco "-on November 12 " two days, I believe, before the new govem- ment was proclaimed in Bio Janeiro. Everything was quiet and as smooth as ever in Pernambuco'wheu we left. "When -we steamed into the harbor of Para on the .morning of the 16th we saw a new flag fly ing from the Brazilian ships." "WHAT THE FLAG IS USE, Captain Hews drew a diagram of the new flag for the reporter. It looked like this: The two triangular divisions of the flag are red, the central portion is white, and the five-pointed star is blue. "I wondered what it all meant," said Captain Hewi, "and I did not make out until the pilot came aboard and told us that there had been a change of rulers, and thai . the monarchy was overthrown. 1 remained .at Para five days. I was ashore a great deal of the time, and if onr agents had not . "told me, and I had not seen the new flag flying, I should .not have known that Dom jrPedro had been deposed. ' - Usverjtninff was going aa as quietly as rWXt herte-wbKfao-erowda nOHrstreitsi no parades of soldiers, no speechmaking or ''loud talking.' The soldiers and the authori ties seemed to be in favor of the new state of things, and that was apparently the seati ' 'ment Of the people as well. 'r 'f ' .'COTJLDH'l TOUCH THE CABLES. , "Superintendent Jordan, .of the Brazilian - Telegraph and Cable Company told me that the new Government attempted to takeen- . tire control of the cables, but he protested . " that the cable was a private enterprise. He promised, however, to submit all mes sages to the inspection of the Chief of Police, and to send away nothing detri mental to the new Government. On this , basis the matter was settled. 1'The coup d'etat of the revolution at Para . was accomplished dramatically, but with only a show of force, and -with the same skill that characterized the movement at Bio Janeiro. The overthrow of the im- . .' ' "perial authorities at the capital of the v" province did not take place until the 16tb, -"" the day following the momentous'e vents." r3. Papers printed during the five days im- v$. mediately succeeding the revolution "were c ' received to-day by Shipton, Green and gf Charles B. Flint. An interesting account -' ; of the usurpation is given by O 'Liberaldo jv Do Para, the organ of the Xibcral party, in its issue or js ovember 17. It follows: y SO BLOODSHED NECESSARY. ' '-"Great events have excited the people of this capital, but, happily, no blood has been Cehed, thanks to the prudence of the honor able administrator of this province. Early in' the morning the news was spread that it was. intended to take by force thePresi- dental chair. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon "tuere arrived at the Presidental palace a commission, the members of which were Dra. Jose Paes de Carvalho, Justo jChefmont, and the Colonel of the '.fifteenth -Begiment, Marcos Antonio Bod . ,rigues. They asked of. His Excellency a'conference.at which they declared that on . laceount of telegrams received from Bio, an . "nouncing the proclamation of a Bepublic and a Provisional Government, in the name oftheofficers and soldiers of the regular "armytbey invited His Excellency to leave the administration with which he' was - charged. They furthermore said that the "tobject of the conference was to avoid vio lence, for the army had resolved to afc f 'complish its object by force of arms if neces sary. - ' ,,-v , ,1 A 

CHAKACTEEISTICBEPLT. ii. m. '"- "HfsExcellency replied in the energetic S" "v" manner which distinguishes him, and with 5, .- the proper politeness of a loyal man, that to t"j ' do what was demanded would be to betray "-" his trust and to abandon the charge in trusted to.him by the Imperial Government. - Thechange of Government had not been en- 'tirely?onsummated. It would be prudent to waU.further events., As.soon as a majority "of the. nation had agieed to the Bepublican . ' movement he would no doubt accept the consummated f sets and resign the Govern- -ment In a contrary event it was a duty of honor to resist any seditious movement, un less he was compelled to submit by force. ' "These words seemed to influence the embers of the commission, who declared V would submit them to the officers of the VZ.jt'Wn'm 'RrrfllTftiiev at nnoA tnnV nn. TOnicnteasures to secure public order 'and ,Wliisown protection. "With that end in view, he orfle'rei the commander of tlie police to be ready to go to the palace at a moment's notice. That ofieialTilmself responded, but his subordinates resigned tnelr commissions, because they sympathized with the republi- can movement, which was started by the military force. NO PEOTECTION OEANTED HOI. His Excellency then demanded protection of the director of the, military forces, but it was refused. In this situation His Excel lency could not find support in either the army or the navy. Ha did not want to risk ,an equal fight .between the few civilians who were ready to defend' his authority and the army. 'His Excellency, Dr. Silvino (Cavaleanti de Aburquerque, resolved to 'avoid violence. About-3 o'clock in the afternoon a mill- 'taryland and some cries of "Viva a Bepub Hcal' announced the coniinfj of the fourth, 'fifteenth and the police regiments,- followed iby the officers of the army, three officers Tf police, the Commander, the Major and the Llentenani Arrived In front of the.palace they, planted . four artillery cuns, which were loaded at once, and the troops were posted around the palace. Following Ihe commission of citizens came a tumultuous crowd cheering for the Bepub lic Then Dr. Jose Paesde Carvalho, in the name of the people and the army, re quested the President of the province to .deliver the government to the provisional directors nominated by the army. Dr. Justo Chermont President. 

OITLT BECAUSE 'HE HAD TO. "His Excellency once ' more energetically declared that only because, compelled by the military force would he 'abdicate thegovern ment of the province, reserving to himself 'the tight of protest and delivering the pro- test, which we pnblish below, to Dr. Paes de Carvalho, to justify in the present andinthe . luturehis action.' ThbPbotkst Confronted by the Intlma ition made to me by the army and citizens rep resented by Or. Jose Paes de Carvalho, and leaving no means of maintaining the pnblio order and the constitutional institutions at my disposal, I declare tliat I yield to this move ment, against which right, honor and the iconntry protests. LnOISO 

CAVAMJAKTIDB ALBTQUEBQUE, President, and his supporters. "After that His ' Excellency left the Talace, followed by Dr. Paes de Carvalho and many friends. These are the facts which preceded the proclamation of the Federal Bepublic. "Without comment we place them before bur readers. A.CTED WITH PETJDEKCE. "It is just to recognize that Dr. Paes de - Carvalho acted with prudence in avoiding the. trouble that might have arisen on such an occasion. The Liberal party, of which we are the organ, feels profoundly that in stitutions which furnish the prosperity of the country are destroyed by a movement that cannot be called democratic. That,will be the judgment of history." The policy of the Liberal party was thus announced by its organ, the paper quoted above, on November 18: "In the difficult situation in which the country is thrown by a revolutionary blow to the institutions founded with our political indepen dence, the Liberal party cannot fofd its arms. It is necessary to define our attitude, in the face of the new situa tion inaugurated by the proclamation of the Bepublic This is not the moment to dis cuss the excellencies of various forms of government, or to seek to restore the monarchy. Judgment, on' their respective merits belongs to the severe impartiality of history. AIT 

EVTDEHT TACT. The irrefutable fact that is imposed upon the pnblio mind, no -matter which may be the dominant opinion, is that the revolution has triumphed right in the heart of the Im perial Government; that the chief of the nation has been forced to abandon the coun try -with his family, and that the Bepublic which was then proclaimed lias been ac cepted and recognized without resistance, if not in all Brazilian 'territory, at least in. the most important proYitictjC- 4 "Everything lem'ahdsihe prtidence of patriotic Liberals, with a Sincere adhesion to the new order of things. Beflecting nat urally about this, momentous crisir, and understanding , their responsibility on ac count of the position, they oc cupy in the Liberal party, conspicuous citizens have resolved to adhere to the Be publican movement,, advising "their as-, sociates to adopt it without any reservation 'restriction. They will gTye a new'organiza tion to the party w'hiely jvvill take the name o the Democratic party ' GEN EBALLY ACCEPTED. "We have the satisfaction of announcing that this resolution has been generally ac cepted by the Liberal party. "We commit ourselves to the new form of Government in the fullest spirit of co-operation in the reali zation of its elevated idea of a democratic administration of public afiairs." The proclamation of the leaders of the Liberal party is as follows: "In the face of the political events just come to pass, changing the form of govern-, ment of the country, patriotism impels us to give our support to the new authorities, with the intention to maintain order and tranquility, on which depends the continuation of the development of the public weal, and the realization of the grandest future of the Brazilian nation. "We invite, therefore, all ourpplitical friends who have followed us in the past to adhere to the republican movement, constituting themselves hereafter the Democratic party, under which flag we will continue to strive for the common interests of the country." 3SO VIOLENCE AT AXL. This address was signed by most of the leaders ot the Liberal party Eo violence of any description is reported in Para up to the time of the departure of the Portuense, November 21. The financial situation as regards this province is no worse, and no immediate trouble ahead is seen. ' A prominent merchant with interests in Brazil received 0 letter saying: "It is not yet known that all the provinces have ad hered. It is feared by some that it will be difficult to enforce the proclamation for a republic There are differences, both in the character of the people and the interests of the North ern and Southern provinces, aud it will be a difficult matter to permanently adjust these conflicting interests." These are the views of foreigners who have lived for many years in Brazil. MET BDT DID KOTHIKG. An Uneventful Meeting of the Democratic State Executive Committee.

The meet ing of the Democratic State Executive Com mittee in this city to-day was attended by four of the seven members, and the session was short'and uneventful. The great fall ingofl in the Democratic vote of Phila delphia at the recent election was discussed, but the committee having no power to take action on the alleccd treachery, the subject was soon dropped. The .main purpose of the meeting was to divide the State into nine districts, each to :be represented by a chairman, whose dnty it was to see that the several .counties embrac ing his district were properly organized. The committee performed this part of its work, and the several chairmen will be elected at meetings to be convened in vari ous portions of the State on the 13th -of January next A resolution was adopted establishing the headquarters of the Demo cratic State Committee in this city.

Ihe Southern question and his manner of dealing with it are. the most talked of matters. One Southern Demo cratic member Says that he will vote against ahy State halving the "World's Fair whose Representatives vote for 0 federal election law. " 

FEOHA STJLIT COBSESPONDEHT.J "WashihqtoS, December 3. The. read ing of the President's message was the only subject to occupy the, time of Congress, to day. In the House there was no attempt made to listen to its contents, and the hum of conversation, the rustling of paper, and the calling of pages would have prevented even the most desirous from following its reading with certainty. In the Senate, however, more than usual attention was paid to this, the first annual message of President Harrison. Senators Evarts, Dawes and Edmunds were unflagging in the interest they displayed, aud Senator Gorman read it to himself from a copy of his own, as being less tiresome than listen ing to the somewhat monotonous tones ot the reading clerk. 

MANY MEN, MANY MINDS. Of course, .opinions on the message differ,, according to the political bias of the parties possessing them, but the general belief is that it is a very creditable document. The Bepublicans are much pleased with the manner in which the President treats the financial affairs of the country, and with his snrcrestiana refrardincr Federal aids to education. The Democrats recognize with pleasure a conservative tone running through the document. By far the most interesting part of the paper to members of both parties was its references to the colored question 'and the Federal control of elections. This subject is one that is recognized on all sides as being the most important to receive the attention of Congress, and the one which will provoke the most discussion and occupy more time than any other to be broached this session. HO 

"MISTAKING THE MEANING. On this- subject the President's words have been carefully chosen, and, though not . openly threatening, Southern members ad mit that there is no mistaking their .mean ing. One gentleman, who did not care to have his name accompany the statement,remarked that the President would probably . have written very differently on this point if his message had been indited before the recent .election in Ohio. He thought Mr. Har rison's white man's party of the South had suddenly become a very black-man's party, and that the change had been brought about by the President's seeing nearly the whole at the colored vote in Ohio, an important factor in the State, leave his party. For' this reason the President is nbw champion- jag.the cause of the black; man in the hope 01 winning bacJc.hu vote. ., 

MUCH BETWEEN THE XINES, Bepresentatlve Catchings, of Mississippi, one of the most intelligent and best informed of the Southern members, and representing a particularly blafek district, was- much in .earnest when he commented on this portion of the message. "There is much-to be read "between the lines,"-said he; "this is the im portant part of the whole message to the South, in my opinion. The power to- take the whole direction and control of the elec tion of members of the House of Bepre sentatives is clearly given to the general Government A partial and qualified su pervision of these elections is now provided for by law, and, in my opinion,- this law may be bo strengthened and extended as to secure, on the whole, better results than can be attained by a law taking all the processes of such election into Federal control. There, you see, the President says he is not in lavor or complete control oy a eaerai au thority 01 tne elections 01 tne country. AT 

TTABIANCE WITH SHEBMAN. "The bill which Senator Sherman intro duced last Congress, and which he is seek ing an early opportunity to reintroduce'this session, provided for the control of 'all the processes of election' by the General Gov ernment Under that bill the elections in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania andv other Northern States would be as much con trolled as those in any Southern State. And the people of the North rebelled at the very suggestion of interfering with, their elec tions in any way, conscious of the fact that they had already placed sufficient safe guards around the ballot box. The senti ment is so great among Northern men that the President sees that Mr. .Sherman's bill would be beaten, if brought to a vote, by, the members ot his own party. Conse quently, he does not advise the adoption of that measure, but recommends the extension of the present existing Haw, so as to arrive at the same results' as would accrue from the Sherman bill, without interfering with the elections of Northern States. 

WHAT HAEEISON HINTS AT. "Now, what the President is hinting at is the bill which Mr. Houk, of Tennessee, in troduced in the last House. By this meas ure the elections in any Congressional dis trict may be placed under Federal control by the petition of 100 electors of that dis trict. With this bill in operation itwonld be not difficult lor 100 negroes to petition for Federal control of the elections in every dis trict of the South, but in the North neither party would desire the interference of the General Government, and the 100 names would not be forthcoming. Such legislation would, therefore, be purely sectional in its operation. Now, the Democrats of the South are fully as conscious of the purity .of their elections as are the Bepublicans of the North, and they have as great repugnance to Federal interference; A MEMOEABIiB 

FIGHT, PEBHAPS. " "If the suggestion of the President is carried out, and the Houk bill pushed as a party measure, the Democrats of the House wilbresist its passage by every means per mitted by parliamentary procedure. It is on this point that the fight will come which will make this Congress a memorable one." Benresentative McMillin. of Tennessee, a prominent Democratic member of the "Ways j ana jucans iiommuice, saiu wa. uu measure looking to Federal control of elections can ever pass the House if brought to a square vote, and he intimated that he knew of a power, yet in abeyance, which would render any such attempt fntile. Bepresentative O'Ferrall, of Virginia, ,who- was one ot the candidates for the Gubernatorial nomination in his State this fall,, said that if any member of Congress from any State desiring the World's Fair to be held in its borders,sbould vote for a Fed eral election law, he would vote against that State, id the "World's Fair matter,

READABLE SXOBY. In this coBReefion there is a story, to-, night which, ,if' true, explains the well-, known difference,, of opinion between the.

Consterna tion has beentyoduced .among the trainmen of the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Bailroad.'by the arrest of John McPherson, John Kinsinger and Charles E. Downs, on the charge of robbing freight cars in the trains on which they were employed, and the issuing of warrants for many others. The trial of Charles'' Downs commenced this morning before Mayor Gay ley. Downs was a brakeman on a local freight and made a cqnfession. He said, the first he knew of thieving was on April 10, last year. One day at Caledonia a quantity of clothing, etc., was abstracted from a car, and upon another occasion, at Martel, a car was opened and three ladies' work boxes were taken and presented to the wives and girls of the men implicated. Downs explained the mode of abstraction, as follows: In nearly every way car soma boxes of through freight, were found, and. these were the boxes tampered with. Goods were always taken from freight consigned to points beyond the New York, Pennsyl vania and Ohio. It is claimed a regular commission business was done at Dayton by the suspected men. Clothing, dress goods, boots and shoes, whisky and nearly every thing suffered. A large number of tbe offi cials of the .road are here and great interest is manifested.

Cox (the dry goodg,mer$tiant who failed yesterday), for SiOOOweia brought to a sudden stop this afteriipt.pira special injunction granted.by Judgderdon, restraining the Sheriff from levyirf3n the goods in tbe store at 1220 Chesti'atstreet, and an order"that Cox sub mit to an examination, by deposition, in support of'the injunction. A few moments before the adjournment of Court of Common Pleas No. 3, 'William M. Singerly and Kichard J. Lennon and their counsel,' Mayer Sutzberger and J.Howard Gendell, came into court and were closeted in chambers with Judge Gordon. At the conclusion ot tbe conference the injunction and order were filed in the Prothonotary's office. A BIO CBEDITOB. Mr. Singerly,. in his affidavit in support of the bill in canity npon which the in junction was granted, says he was a credi tor, to a-very large amonjjt, of Lewis S. Cox, who transacts business in the city of Phila delphiaahd elsewhere, as Lewis S. Cox & Co. "His debt to me," says Mr. Singerly, "exceeds all his other debts combined. In addition to a.Iarge mill and factory owned and conducted by him, he also, prior to July 1,1889, conducted in his own name, as Lewis S. Cox, a large retail business at 1220 Chestnut street Philadelphia. On July 1, 1889, or aboutthat date, I purchased from him the business of said store, together with the entire stock-in-trade thereof, in consideration of the sum of about $147,000, the entire amount of which was charged 10 my account, and thereby paid in full. SIR! SINOEBLT XN CONXBOL. "I then took full, entire, complete and exclusive possession of said store and stock of goods, and have retained the same from that time. Tne said Cox has had nothing to do with the store since, nor has he been there, excepting a few times as a casual visilor." The bill in equity, after giving the facts in tho affidavit, recites that the direction to levy npon the plaintiffs property was in pursuance'ofa fraudulent combination be tween Cox .and Yietor, entered into for the purpose of hindering, delaying,- and ., defrauding the plaintiff, who is .the principal creditor of Cox, not only by preventing the plaintiff from collecting 'the, claim he owns against Cox, or any part thereof bnt by intimidating, annoying, and .oppressing him; .by levying upon bis -property., .under the pretense that it belonged to. Coxand-that in pursuance of the jBonspirjcy,-Coxf agreed to-acttBe' representative and agent ot Vietor, and of the parties for whom Vietor stands as trus tee, and with the full knowledge and concur rence of Yietor, and that in pursuance of the said fraudulent conspiracy the levy upon the property at 220 Chestnut street was ueuiucu w uc uiauc. NOT A LEGAL TBTJTSTEE. The plaintiff avers that under these cir cumstances Yietor is not in law the trustee of a trust judgment, but as the agent of the judgment debtor becomes in law an assignee for the benefit ot creditors. The plaintiff believes and avers that tbe Sheriff's sale, to be held under the execution, is to be used and is intended as a means of transferring the legal title of Cox's property to Vietor, and which is thereafter to be held by Vietor, subject to the control and direction and for the benefit of Cox. The prayer of the billvis that Cox and Vietor oe restrained from ' further prosecu ting the execution; that the Sheriff be en joined Irom keeping possession of the goods at 1220 Chestnut street, and offering them for sale, and that tbe acts and doings of Vietor and Cox be declared to constitute an assignment for the benefit of creditors, with preferences contrary to the statute, and that a receiver be appointed by the court to take possession of all of Cox's assets, and to ad minister the same according to law and under the direction of the court. THE INJUNCTION GRANTED. Judge Gordon granted tbe special in junction prayed for, and fixed the security at $1,000, returnable within five days. A transcript of the $185,000 judgment note has been entered in the Montgomery county court, and the. Sheriff of that county has levied upon the residence and other property of Mr. Cox, at Ogontz.

Sunday evening be and his wife. attended Zion Colored Church, .on Fifteenth street,, and he created a, sensation during the serv ices by rising and telling the congrega tion that he felt as if he was going to die.

Poet wasne, lNrt.,December3. Quite a stir has.beed caused in church circles here by an attempt by some members of the Emmanuel Lutheran Church to prevent the funeral of John O. Goenges, a member of the congregation, from being ' conducted at tbe church. The deceased was a respecta ble citizen;- -and the objection raised grows out of the fact that he was a saloon keeper. The relatives, of the dead man made a stubborn fight- for their right, as they termed it,, and after repeated, meetings of the congregation it was decided, against the objections of a large minority, to allow the services to be held at the church. The case presents a novel featui e from the fact that the congregation of Emmanuel Church is composed wholly of German Americans, and their objections to the sa loon business is' thus, made public for the first time.

All the towns along the Naugatuck Valley have, been overrun with prire fighters for the past few weeks, and there has been a joint effort on the part of the police and the deputy sheriffs to put a stop to the business and to drive the fighters back to New York, whence most of them came. At the start tbe fights took place in the small villages in the dark hours of the night, while the sturdy grangers slept, and to apprehend the guilty parties would have been a uimcuic tasc as ice spectators were always selected from the right crowd.

Sir Julian, Pauncefote, the British Minister, and other members of the Diplomatic Corps' are -very indignant at the shabyb treatment which they received at the Capitol to-day, and it is quite likely there will be an in-' vestigation of the affair. One sec-' tion of the House gallery is re-. served for the use of the foreign visitors, and the seats in it are under, the control of the Secretary of State. On nearly every occasion of unusual interest,, the House gallery is reserved for the use of the -foreign visitors, and the seats in it are tinder the control of the Secretary of State. , ' On nearly every occasion of unusual inter est the members of the House manage to have this gallery thrown open to their families and friends, regardless of the rights of the diplomats. DECIDEDLY MOKE SZBIOI7S. t To-day the trouble over this matter was more serious than, usual, and the persons entitled to the seats, including Sir Julian and his friends, were rudely refused the opportunity to occupy them. When the crowd had become so great that every seat in the galleries was filled, 'the unfortunate , sightseers looked longingly upon the vacant places in the diplomatic gallery- A number sought the Doorkeeper, who, ; either in person or by written order, admit ted a sufficient number to fill the gallery, in violation of propriety, courtesy and the rules of the House, which provide that no one shall be admitted to the gallery except, upon presenting a card signed by the Secre tary pf State. Naturally, members of the' Pan-American Congress were anxious to be, present, and, to those who applied, orders; of admission had been issued by the Secre tary of State, and, they went to swell, the number of chagrined -foreign representa tives. SNUBBED SOUTH AMERICANS. A number of the South Americans, one of whom 'was Dr. Nin, of Uruguay,' went in . upon the floor of the House; -only to-be per emptorily ordered out. Two ladies; who were of the party, were told to stand their -ground by some member , of 1 Congress, and their very positive, refusal to budge secured tnem tne privilege 01 staying. . , - Mr. "Walker Blaine appeared upon the J4ku scene soon after Sir Julian. Pauncefote and "" 1 his party had gone, and promptly demanded an explanation of the Doorkeeper in charge, ' by whom he was referred to the Assistant Doorkeeper of the-House. LEADER JTKINLEI. A Straw That Shows Bow the Wind Blows Sir. Bayne Indicates the Drift of Els Party Toward the Ohio major's Leadership. SrZCIAI. TXXXOBAX TO TBI BU7ATCBU "Washington, December 3. The pro ceedings on the floor of the House to-day re- ) moved whatever doubt may have heretofore existed as to who would be chair man of the "Ways and Means Commit tee in this Con cress and leader of the Bepublicans. Tne Chairman of this Commitee is by long-established custom 'a member of the Committee onBules and leader of the party on the floor. Judge Kelley, of Pennsylvania, Was chairman of the committee in 1883, when the tariff act of March 3 was passed, and thinks his long term of service and devotion '' to the protection policy entitles him to the honor asain. There has been a general impression, however, that the old man would be shelved if Beed became Speaker, and this impression has now deepened into a general conviction that McKinley, the Pennsylvaman's protege, will be promoted over the head of his tutor. So general is this understanding that tha Bepublicans already recognize McKinley as the party leader on the floor, and the Ohian assumes direction as if it were a set tled fact- McKinley has never here-' tofore taken a very prominent .part in general debate on the floor, but he Jias thorough command ot himself, and the re spect ofhis colleagues, so tnat tne leader ship will fall upon his shoulders easily. The first indication of who would take Beed's place was given just after the read ing of the President's message, when Mc Kinley arose and moved its reference to the committee of the whole.' A mo ment later Tom Bayne, of Pittsburg, one of Beed's chief lieutenants in tbe Speakership fight, rose with a motion that when the House adjourned it would meet on Thurs- . day. As he spoke he turned from the Speaker to McKinley, to see if tbe motion met his approval, and on receiving a nod, proceeded with his remarks; The man ner in which Bayne performed this little act of courtesy to McKinley, paying no atten tion to Cannon and the other ex-Speakership candidates, showed plainer than words the' part McKinley was to play in the Pifty-first Congrtss.

By a' clause in the sundry civil appropriation bill passed last winter, the Speaker of the Fifty-first Congress was authorized to appoint a committee of five members, to act with the committee of tho Senate, in arranging for the centennial celebration of the first meeting of Congress. "Wednesday, December 11, was fixed as the date of the celebration. Speaker Beed to-day ap pointed Messrs. Bayne, Hitt, Culbertson, of Texas, Carter, ot Montana, and Cum mings, of NewYorkr This committee will meet with. the Senate Committee to-morrow afternoon. Elaborate invitations will be issued to the President, the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps, members of the Cabinet, General of the annyand staff, Governors of States and eminent ex-officials of the Government. The matter had been entirely forgotten. Had President Harrison known, of it, it is likely that he would have declined tbe invitation for the opening: of the Chicago Auditorium, Monday night, -Chief Justice Fuller is to deliver the ora tks, ad had to give up going to Chicago.
