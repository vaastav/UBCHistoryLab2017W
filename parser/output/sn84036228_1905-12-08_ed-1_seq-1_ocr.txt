County Attorney Ayers came out from Lewistown to conduct the case against Glratd, and the showing made by him was conclusive. Pioneer Prospector Dead. Charles E. Rhodes, one of the oldest prospectors in Fergus county, died at Maiden last Tuesday, aged 70 years. Mr. Rhodes had followed prospecting continuously for 40 years, spending about 25 years in this county. In his time he made ft number of important discoveries, but did not profit by them to any great extent. He was the dis coverer of the valuable copper deposits on Sheep mountain, back of Maiden, and with Otto Anderson, owned these at the time of his death. Mr. Rhodes was unmarried, and had no relatives in this part of the country. A broth er residing at Santa Rosa, Cal., has been notified of his death. Miss Cassie Dahl and Miss Edna Chatten, of the county high school, spent Thanksgiving at their homes here. Miss Mae Littlejohn, of Lewistown, was visiting friends here Thanksgiv ing, and also took in the masquerade dance. W. W. Badger, of the Gold Reef Min ing company, has been visiting his parents at White Sulphur Springs for a few days before their departure to California, where they expect to make their future home. F. A. Barnes and family returned from a visit to his parents in Missouri and says they had an exuelien^ time while gone. R. W. Jones and Deputy Sheriff Whitcomb were business visitors to Lewistown last Monday. Postmaster McKee was in Lewis town last Monday.

Phipps and daughter, Ed ith, left on Wednesday's coach for their ranch near Glasgow. A deed was given by Samuel Hur vitch, guardian of the estate of Alice Main Whitcomb, to Chas. Tholer, for 160 acres of land near Maginnis, for which some money was saved to the heir through the efforts of the Macca bee lodge. Mr. Whitcomb was a mem ber of the lodge, and when he died he left one heir in Nortport, Me. Mr. Whitcomb had taken up the homestead a short time before his death. The land was contested by H. C. Burnett for non-residence. The Maccabees took up the matter and appeared for the minor child, and Mr. Hurvitch was ap pointed guardian. The land was sold by order of the district court and the proceeds, less expenses, sent to North port, Me. Dr. Lakey, of Gilt Edge, Dr. Wilson and Mr. McClain, of Lewistown, re turned from a hunting trip. The par ty had been near Valentine Springs, and say they were comfortably locat es during the storm. They brought home four deer as trophies of the chase. Herder is Missing. Mr. Wilson reports that a herder by the name of James Twohig. who was working for John Roch near the Springs, was undoubtedly frozen to death, as he has been lost 10 or 11 days. Mr. Towhig is well known here by many of the old-timers. He was a veteran of the civil war and was also a pensioner. He also wore a Ma sonic pin and was known aB an hon est, hard working man, who did not seem to realize the value of money. The Gilt Edge and Billings stage line has been unable to make their regular trip during the storm. It took five days to make one trip from Gilt Edge to Musselshell. The ranchers along the line say there is more snow this year than there has been for several years. Woodmen's Masquerade. The masquerade given by the Mod ern Woodmen of America was a grand success, more than 200 persons at tending. The hall was decorated for the occasion and many fine costumes were worn. The supper was served by c. H. Dahl, which is a guarantee of its being first-class. The music «as furnished by the Du Clos orches tra, of Lewistown.

MURDER AT HELENA. Corporal in 24th Infantry Killed by Colored Woman. Helena, Dec. 7.—Early this morning, Nora Menzie, colored, living at 132 Clore street, shot Wm. F. Cyrus, color ed, a corporal of company A, Twenty fourth infantry, directly over the left eye, and then went to the police sta tion and gave herself up. Cyrus was fatally wounded and died at 3:30 a. Thomas Carroll, a private in com pany A, was in the room at the time the shooting occurred. He said that be did not hear them quarreling and he was not paying any particular at tention to thfem when the shot was fired. Carroll said the woman said to him, placing the revolver on the table: '■Well, I shot him. You go and get the police." When seen at the city jail the wom an was still crying, and when asked why she shot him, she said: "i shot him in self defense. He had abused me two or three other times. He came into my place while I was packing my trunk, getting ready to leave tomorrow, and began to abuse me. He came in this evening and be gan to raise hell. He jumped on me and I shot him." Dies at Insane Asylum. "Dad" Smith, the aged colored man who for years resided inthis city, and who was recently committed to the insane asylum, died at that institution early this week as the result of a gen eral breaking down of the system. The end was perhaps hastened by a bad fall which he had before being taken in custody here. He leaves a wife, who resides in Lewistown. Locates in Lewistown. Dr. R. L. Stokes, who for two years was on the medical staff at the state insane asylum at Warm Springs, and whose standing as a physician is high, has come to Lewistown to locate, be ing attracted by the bright future of this city, and its pleasant surround ings. The doctor has taken offices in the Bank of Fergus Cotanty build ing. SOUGHT PARDON FOR HUSBAND DEATH END8 EFFORTS OF MRS BOOTH TO SECURE HER HUS BAND'S RELEA8E. The funeral of the late Mrs. Ira Booth was held from Creel's under taking parlors Tuesday afternoon, Rev. H. G. Wakefield, of St. James' Epis copal church, conducting the services. Back of this death there is quite a story. Mrs. Boot was the wife of Ira Booth, who is now serving a term in the pen itentiary for grand larceny. Booth was arrested by Under Sheriff Ed. Mar tin for breaking into a cabin in the Musselshell country and stealing some things. He was convicted and nearly two years ago was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Wife 8ought Pardon. Mrs. Booth, who was the daughter of a. well known rancher residing on Willow creek, stood by her husband after his conviction, and made every effort to secure his release. Twice she visited Helena and waited upon Gov. Toole to try and induce him to extend executive clemency, and she had also called upon Judge E. K. Cheadle to enlist his sympathy. Her untiring efforts were unavailing, how ever, and the situation preyed upon her mind and had much to do with undermining her health. She died at her father's home on Willow creek. "HUTCH" BADLY INJURED. Well Known Freighter Meete With Accident at Kendall. Special to the Argus. Kendall. Dec. 7, 7:00 p. m.—William Hutchinson, familiarly known as "Hutch," who has been hauling freight into the Judith Basin for the past twenty years, was severely injur ed here today and at this time is still unconscious. He was coming into Kendall with a load of hay, and when near town the sleigh slipped and the load overturned, throwing him for ward. He struck on the icey road on his face and when found was uncon scious and bleeding profusely. He was at once taken to the hotel and physicians called. It is feared con cussion of the brain has been caused and the doctors are doubtful of his re covery. Two Bills by Dixon. Washington D. C- Dec. 7.—Repre sentative Dixon introduced bills in the house today appropriating $125,000 for a public building at Missoula and $300, 000 for a federal courthouse and a postaffice at Great Falls. Summary of State Paper That Deals With All the Principal Questions Before The Nation-Government Must have Supervision of Transportation Rates -Rebates Must be Stopped-The Insurance Business-The Great Trusts-Panama Canal-Restriction of Immigration a Washington. Dec. 6.—Following is a summary of the annual message of President Roosevelt to congress: Rigid economy in expenditures is of prime importance. The abolishment of the office of receivers of the land offices would effect a saving. Fewer documents by tens of thousands should be printed at the government's ex pense. Upon the national banks should be placed the burden of maintaining a cir culation of currency adequate at all times; the currency system should be made more elastic. Much of the "red tape" now a part of the work of the departments should be eliminated and modern business methods supplant antiquated systems. Stringent laws should be passed pro viding penalties for bribery in connec tion with federal elections. Campaign contributions are necessary and just, but often they take the form of extor tion. Publicity 1 b the remedy. Contri butions by corporations should be pro hibited; directors should not be per mitted to use stockholders' money. A second peace conference has been suggested and the suggestion acquies ced in by the principal nations. It will be held at The Hague and will deal with five subjects, generally re lating to armament and the law of war fare. Sometimes war is necessary. At this time the only means of preserv ing peace is the armies and navies of the powers that stand for justice. International arbitration is a first consideration. Since the end of the insurrection in the Philippines the army has been re duced one-third. The Monroe doctrine is an effective instrument for peace in its adaptation to changing conditions. All of the re publics on this continent must behave themselves and meet their obligations. The appeal of Santo Domingo was urgent and met with speedy response. The Army and Navy. Our small army should be brought to as high a state of efficiency as pos sible. Appropriations are needed for maneuvers of a practical kind. The number of posts should be diminished and those remaining made larger. Mer it should be considered in making pro motions. The coast artillery forces ought to be increased. Our navy, after many years, has reached a high standard of effiffciency. What is needed now is not a greater number of ships, but better ships. The officers and men must receive the very highest training. Naturalization laws are in dire need of revision. The criminal laws have, in many cases, become obsolete and require ex tensive revision. Breaches of trust in the public ser vice should be made punishable. The monopolizing of public lands should be rendered impossible. Pro gress is being made under the reclam ation act. The government should assume con trol of the open range. Gratifying headway is being made in the policy of forest reservation. The system of levees along the Mis sissippi should be given attention. The merchant marine is in a sad way and demands adequate and imme diate relief. The Jamestown tercentennial ought to be encouraged. The work of the bureau of pensions is deserving of commendation. Restriction of Immigration. Through the activity of foreign steamship companies hundreds of thousands of undesirable immigrants are landed on our shores. While de sirable aliens are welcome, stem re strictions should be imposed. The question of distribution is a grave one. No immigrants should be allowed to come in from Canada or Mexico, save natives of those countries. Violations of the contract labor law should be severely punished. The quality of the immigrant should be the test. There is no call for a change in the present Chinese exclusion law, but a more efficient inspection service should be inaugurated in China. The country continues to enjoy pros perity. Not even a panic would have a permanent evil effect. All men must work, the one of greater ability will receive the larger share of that which is produced, but, in proportion the less fortunate have a part in the sharing. The strike more often falls the heavier on the striker than upon the one struck at. The Great Trusts. Unfortunately some of the excep tionally gifted men, in the absence of government restraint, use their ener gies in ways that are not for the com mon good. The government should have power to control the conduct of great corporations. The makers of the constitution provided especially that the regulation of interstate com merce should come within the sphere of the general government. Experience has shown that it is use less to try to get any adequate regula tion and supervision by state action. If a law enacted by congress fails, if may become necessary ultimately to adopt a constitutional amendment. Great corporations now occupy the positions of subjects without a sov ereign. It is generally useless to try to pro hibit all restraint on competition. Where it is not useless it is usually hurtful. While the department of justice, during the last four years, has accom plished much by appeal to the courts iu of of iu an attempt to secure the enforce ment of the anti-trust laws, the effect has more of a moral character than of practical result. The chief abuse is over-capitaliza tion, generally itself the result of dis honest promotion. It means inflation and invites business panics. It is ruin ous to the small investor, discourages thrift and encourages gambling. Worst of all is the trickiness and dishonesty which it implies. Harm to morals is worse than any possible harm to ma terial interests. Railway Rate Supervision. The government must have supervis ion of rates of transportation. Rebates must be stopped. The supervisory power should be given to some administrative body created by congress. If given to the interstate commerce commission such commission should be made unequiv ocally administrative. There should be a minimum of tariff "tinkering." Especially should there be an entire absence of a tariff operat ing for or against any state or person. Commercial treaties with foreign na tions are highly desirable. In case of discrimination of any ship per, the commission should have the power to fix the already established minimum rate as the maximum. It would need only one or two such decis ions to cure railroads of the practice of giving improper minimum rates. It is not intended that the commis sion shall have the power to initiate rates, but to regulate a rate already fixed. A heavy penalty should be pro vided for a violation of the orders of the commission. The power to establish a maximum rate is the essential ; unless it is se cured, there is little use of touching the subject at all. The big shipper is equally to blame with the railroads. Shippers are often told by railroads to buy large quanti ties of a certain commodity. Then the railroad announces a reduction to take effect immediately, thus stifling all competition. Rebates of all forms, concessions, free passes, reduced pas senger rates, etc., should be made il legal. ^ Consideration might be given to the plan of conferring on the government tlie right to bring actions against the beneficiaries of rebates for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would tend to stop what is really black mail. Elevator allowances should be stop ped. The best possible regulation of rates can be secured by honest agreement among railroads themselves, but the commission should have supervision over such agreements. However, it may be inadvisable to take up this phase of the matter at this time. The vital need is the power vested in the government to fix a maximum rate, subject to review by the courts. Private car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges and the like should be put under the supervision of the interstate commerce commis sion. The missuse of these devices is as pernicious as rebates in other forms. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers. The books should be open to inspection by the government at all times. Agreements as to transportation within a state intended to operate as a fraud upon the federal law should be under the jurisdiction of the com mission. ExpediticAis action is the prime es sential. Delay is now the most for midable weapon in the hands of those who would violate the law. Many of the railroads are willing to be honest. They are at the mercy of those who are not. Government supervision will give all an equal chance. This government stands for man hood first and for business only as an adjunct of manhood. Therefore there is a high moral responsibility resting on the railroads and the big shippers as well as the public. The question of transportation lies at the root of all industrial success; but there must be a recognition of the principle of equal rights. The small town should be accorded the same privileges as the big city. It is not the intention to indicate to congress the exact terms of the law, but its most important provisions should be that of conferring upon a competent administrative body the power to decide whetther a railroad rate is just; if unjust, then to pre scribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall be unlawful to go—the maxi mum reasonable rate. This decision should go into effect within a reason able time and obtain subject to re view by the courts. The railroad is the highway of com merce of today and it must be kept open to all on equal terms. Under proper supervision there is no need of public ownership of rail roads; they can render better service when conducted by/ private individ uals. The men composing any supervis ory body must be possessed of the highest probity; they must be well paid. Otherwise such men cannot be secured. The (dock signal system should be established on all roads. The law pro viding for safety appliances has been successful in its operation. The hours of labor for trainmen and other railroad employes engaged in similar service should be limited by law. 75 .... . American citizenship should be con- j ferred upon the inhabitants of Porto ; Rico In general there should be an in-! increased liberality in the treatment of the whole insular franchise ques tion. Alaska is entitled to an elective del egate; if that be impossible an appoin tive delegate; Alaska Indians who are competent should have the right of citizenship. Indian Territory and Oklahoma should be admitted ns one state and New Mexico and Arizona as another; the question has already caused too much delay. The Panama Canal. The feasibility of the Panama canal route has been established; the en gineering difficulties have been solved. The type—lock or sea level—will pres ently be determined. The preliminary work of providing sanitary quarters has been completed. A further ap propriation to carry on the work is needed. The state department demands re lief. There should be general improve ment in the consular service. Our in creased foreign trade makes this im perative. An employers' liability law should be passed for all industries within the scope of federal power. There should be particular atten tion given to the District of Columbia respecting tenements, sanitation, pub lic parks ami playgrounds. Washing ton should be made a model city, in order that it may become an object lesson for states and municipalities. The power of the courts to issue in junctions in cases of labor disputes has been abused, but it should not be restricted; it is coexistent with the right to strike. The department of commerce and labor should investigate conditions in the various states as they affect child and women labor. There should be an investigation of the entrance of women into industrial life. The decrease in the number of marriages and berths is a menance to the nation. The wage worker and the capitalist should consult freely together and should regard each other as partners and not as enemies. The Insurance Business. The insurance business has grown too large for state control. Cannot the bureau of corporations constitu tionally hold supervision over the in terstate business of the great com panies? Little check is now placed upon unscrupulous men. Congress should consider the question of govern mental im wer in respect to domestic insurance. The system prevailing in foreign countries should be studied. Insurance is recognized as national in character. In The Phillipines. In spite of disasters,the greatest of which was the loss by rinderpest of 75 per cent of the cattle, the Philli pine islands have made progress. The improvements are being pressed and the educational system extended. The duty on all imports from the Phllli pines, except that on tobacco and sug ar, should be removed at once; that on the last named products should re main at 25 per cent of the Dingley tariff, to be removed entirely after July 1, 1909. The civil service should be extended. Removals for cause are now made without notice. Politics has been practically elim inated from the field of government employment. The copyright laws are confused anJ ought to be given prompt consider ation. Traffic in adulterated foods should be abolished. The gift of the Yosemite valley and Mariposa Big Tree grove made by Cal ifornia should be accepted without de lay. The Grand Canyon of the Colo rado should be made into a park. New York shate should give Niagara Kalis to the government. The herd of buffaloes on the Flat head reservation should not be per mitted to become extinct. The pension system forjhe life sav ing service is a matter that should not be longer neglected. The effect of the supreme court de cision declaring an Indian holding an allotment to be a citizen has been the cause of much intoxication among the trihsmen. More day schools for the Indians are urgently needed. The fortification of Hawaii is im perative; the islands are too heavily taxed; there is urgent need of im provements in the harbors and the schools must be extended; the stand ard of citizenship if the Islands must be elevated. Tragedy in the Philippines. Cebu, P. I ,D,ec. 3, via Manila. Dec. 5.—Lieut. Chas. Pendleton of the con stabulary ordered four native soldiers into the vehicle in which he was driv ing. A native policeman stopped him and ordered him to light the lamps on the vehicle, when Pendleton shot him dead. He then continued on his way, but returned later and obtained tlie body, which he delivered to the police, claiming that he had found the man dead on the road. The soldiers ac companying him confirmed his story, until today, when they broke down. Pt ndleton had been drinking. Pendleton's family hve at Atlanta, (la. He was formerly a sergeant in the Seventy-first regiment of New York. He has been held for murder. Illegal Fencing in Kansas. Topeka, Kas., Dec. 7.—The special United States grand jury, called to in vestigate alleged land frauds in Kan sas, commenced its work at Topeka today. Before taking up the alleged land swindles, the ^rand jury will investi K ate the fencing of public lands by the cattle barons of western Kansas. Unit ed States District Attorney J. S. Dean recently went to Washington to confer with officials of the department of jus tice. regarding the prosecution of the cattlemen. One of the important cases of this class will lie that of John A. Kelly, of Stevens county, who, it Is al leged. has fenceil in a single pasture containing about 54 square miles, ov er half of which is government land. New York Jews Have Parade. New York. Dec. 7.—One hundred thousand Jews, each wearing a band ol crepe on the left arm. marched lin der a myriad of black banners through the principal streets of the East side today accompanied by bands playing dirges in memory of the Jews massa cred in Russia. Hundreds of women and children joined in singing and hands were scattered throughout the long parade. A procession marched to the plaza in Union square, where It resolved itself into a mass meeting to formulate resolutions. Brief, terse resolutions were read by their leaders to the thousands of paraders. The voting was done orally with a great show, in which the reso lutions were adopted unanimously. After outlining the Russian atrocities, and calling upon the United States to interfere in behalf of the Jews, the resolutions continue: "To our overwhelming shame, dis appointment and sorrow, we realize that eternal vigilance is the price of the Jew's life, and we urge our peo ple to take up arms against their as sailants, and if need be to sell their lives most dearly. We call Jews ev erywhere to aid the defense of the Jewish people." FOR THE
