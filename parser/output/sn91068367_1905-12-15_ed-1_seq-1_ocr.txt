Washington, December 13. The "Washing of Democratic linen for the amusement of Republicans," as Mr. Williams, the minority leader put it Monday occupied the attention of the House for more than four hours today. The result accomplished way a deft thrown at the minority leader by Rep resentative Lamar of Florida, and an other by Representative Shackelford, of Missouri. The complaint of both re sulted from the failure of Mr. Williams to recommend their reappointment as members of the committee on inter state and foreign commerce. Both made long speeches in which Mr. Williams leadership was assailed from many points. Mr. Williams re - plied fo Mr. Lamar at some length and briefly to Mr. Shackelford. His de fense was that last session the Dem ocrats on this committee were divided and he deemed it necessary for the good of the party and the country that a united minority report should be made on the subject of railroad rate legislation. Speaking of the leadership of Mr. Williams. Mr. Lamar said he would recognize him as the party leader but not personally, "until he relieves me of an unjust charge on his part." Ho stated that he did not agree with Mr. Williams that Republicans would enjoy personalities between Democrats. Kmphasizing this he re ferred to the personal debate of last session between Mr. Sullivan, of Mas sachusetts, and Mr. Hearst, New York At that time he charged the minority leader had made no objection to the procedure. Mr. Lamar reverted to the great im portance of railroad rate legislation and reviewed the action of the House at the last session which included vot ing down the Davey bill, proposed by the minority. The Davev bill, he said had first been adopted by a Democratic caucus. The bill then contained but two sections. The committee added five sections. Kven after these sections had been added, he still thought and would con tinue to think the Hearst bill superior The minority leader, he said, was forced to amend the Davey bill on the lloor of the House or see it go out to the country in an imperfect condi tion., If that caucus was binding then he challenged the minority leader to deny tbf fact that no one could have amended it. Conceded that the mi nrHtv lpadpr should have power to make committee removals as well as appointments, but he must exercise that power in the face of moral obli gation and a reasonableness. He re viewed the fact that he had voted for Mr. Williams as leader, "and sustain ed him when his party turned him down on the Miles amendment." Mr. Lamar concluded with the state ment that he considered his removal from the commerce committee an act absolutely untenable and an aspersion upon his private character. He se cured the reading of correspondence on the matter between himself and Mr. Williams. Mr.' Lamar said it had gone to the country through the press that the minority leader would not tolerate fol-lo-erc of Mr. Hearst. He admitted he felt friendly to- ward Mr. Hearst and regarded his bilTa good pne. He then charged Mr. Williams with contributing more In one minut? to Democratic inharmony than, he (Mr. Lamar) had in a year. He admitted that on Monday he was in the heit of anger and glad that he had been stopped. However, his per sonal friendship for Mr. Williams had ceased. Mr. Williams was at once recognized to reply. "I am." he said. "aTsout to perform a very unpleasant duty and one the wisdom of which I have seri ous doubt?. The gentleman knows himself too seriously. He t thinks he can make a national issue out of a committee assignment, but he can't do it. He thinks he was removed but ho was not. There was no committee. Mr. Williams asked if he would not Tiave been lacking in moral ' courage and in every essential of a floor leader if he had made up a minority mem bership of the commerce committee which would have been divided four to two on the auestion. of railroad rates. "My trotheY would have gone off that committee under the same cir cumstances." said Mr. Williams and he added that had the Hearst bill re ceived the minority-support In com mittee he would have supported It in caucus. . 1 Comnaring Mr. Lamar to his great -nnele "L. q. C. Lamar' . Mr. " Williams ' ra!(i the uncle possessed Vsuperb ego tism, but he also possessed to conse crate it. a superb intellect," The conversion to the Hearst bill he j likened to the conversion of Saul on his way to Damascus. It was inspir ed. Long applause followed the state merit of Mr. Williams that he should Ignore the personalities of Mr. Lamar. Applause again followed Mr. Williams when he said he had not allowed per sonalities to influence his transaction of public business. And what he had done he said, had been approved by "almost the unanimous opinion of members of the minority of the House." , He referred to the committee ap pointments of Mr. Hearst labor and irrigation of arid lands and admitted he did. not love Mr. Hearst "why should I love a millionaire who owns many newspapers which he seems to be devoting to tearing me down?" Mr. Williams concluded with ex pressions of regret at the proceedings. Mr. Lamar at once appealed for recognition, as did Mr. Shackelford. Mr. Lamar was recognized for fifteen minutes. He spoke with visible feel ing and charged that the minority leader had called the rate bill caucus of last session because he was angry at being turned down by his colleagues on the Miles amendment. "It was not a en neiis: it was a gold brick." he added. Mr. Williams interrupted to cau tion Mr. Lamar and "to prevent un pleasant things from happening." say ing that "the gentleman is not permit ted to use insulting language on the floor of this House." Before he concluded Mr. Lamar re ferred to a letter of criticism of Mr. Hearst by. Mr. Williams. The latter denied -the criticism. During this de nial Mr. Shackelford was recognized and reviewed the history of rate leg islation. Mr. Shackelford commended Mr. Hearst personally and for his rate bill. He was glad to see that President Roosevelt in his message had "come around to the Hearst bill." Ho declared against "bosses" and "boss rule." Mr. Williams said he had had enough and did not desire to reply. The past had gone. He looked to the future and believed that this year there would be found six Democrats on a committee which would agree. He was tired of discord. "We are repre sented now in all the funny 'papers of the country as a donkey. "The trouble is." he continued, turn ing to the Republican side of the chamber, "that the people of the coun try are tired of you and are afraid of . , a i 1 J -C us and it is pariiaiiy on accuuiu "i surh thiners as happened here this morning, that it is afraid of us. The Democratic party. Mr. Williams aid. would vote for a Republican rate bill if it contained power to name a substitute rate, to put and keep it in force, and to regulate private car lines and other abuses. The House ad journed until tomorrow. Senate Proceedinss. HO
