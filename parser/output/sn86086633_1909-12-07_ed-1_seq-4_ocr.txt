The .mil-trust and Interstate com nn iee law are not touched upon In the message, the president preferring to deal with these In later special messages. The sugar scandal Is referr ed to, but a congressional investiga tion not advised at this time because of possible embarrassment to the pend ing probe. A similar reuson prompted the president not to recommend any amedm nts to the utui-trubt laws at present, fearing that In some way pending cases might be affected. The president shows excellent Judgment in his decision to let these matters go for a time and handle them later In special communications. No further revision of the tariff Is recommended until the tariff board's investigations reveal reliable facts upon which such revision enn bo Intelligently undertaken. Mr. Taft's Judgment in i this respect will meet with general' approval as there is nothing that so eomplt tely upfcets the country and mars the even tenor of business us tariff agitation. An interesting Item In the message is the announcement that the cost of the Panama canal, which will be com pleted by Jan. 1. 191.".. will be $373,201. 000. Many other matters of interest are tituhed upon, and legislation urged which will be recognized as timely and in most cases urgent. HOW IT 

WORKS. Many Americans have difficulty abojt understanding why the Hritish people stick to a monarchical form of government instead of adopting a re publican system similar to ours. The f.ict i that for many sane purposes the British system is more completely and quickly responsive to the will of the people than is our own. A short editorial article in th Ietroit News exp ;iins this, clearly In outlining what will follow the action of the house of lords in refusing to approve tin. bud get adopted by the lions.- of r ominous. ! is lure given: j:y turning down the luJ.if by a vol" of 330 to 73. tile lhitisfl house of 'ords- has put l!.e issue up to t,io peo ple.

My meeting w ith President IMaz and the trreetlng exchanged u both Amer ican and Mexican se.il served. 1 hope, to signalize the close and cordial rela tions w hich so well bjnd together this republic and the grejit republic Imme diately to the smith, between which there Is so vast a network of material Interests. I am happy to say that nil but out of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been nettled within the past few months and that, under the enlight ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. On July o", l!Hi., the government ol r.tiuima ji greed, after considerable ne- ; gotlation, to Indemnify the relatives of the American oillecrs and sailors who wero brutally treated, one of them having. Indeed, been killed by the ranaman police this year. This government was obliged to In tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nica ragua, which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of n protocol on Sept. IS, loot). Many years ago diplomatic Interven tion became necessary to the protec tion of the interests In the American claim of AIsop & Co. against the government or Chile. lhe govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligjitloii in the case and had prom Ised this government to Kettle It. There had been two abortive attempts to dej so through arbitral commissions, which failed through lack of jurlsdietion. Now, happily, as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations, tho gov ernments of the United States and ol Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain tlmse cordial and friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defin itive settlement by lib; llrltannle majes ty IM ward VII. Th Nicaraguan Trouble. Since the Washington conventions of 1J7 were communicated to the gov eminent of the I'nited States as a con sulting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one v another and In turn by nil of the live Central Amer ican republics to exert itself for tho maintenance of the conventions. Ne;ir ly every complaint h;is been ng.iin.st the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America in constant tension or turmoil. The re aponses made to the representations of Central American republics as due from the United States on account of its relation to the Washington conven tions have been at all times conserva tive and have avoided, so far as possi ble, any semblance of interference, al though It is very apparent that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very sub stantial American Interests in Central America give to the United States a special position in the 7.oue of theso republics and the Caribbean sea. I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these re publics, efforts which are fully appre ciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true Interests. It would be no less unnecessary to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were olh cers in tho organized forces of a rev olution which had continued many weeks aud was iu control of about half of the republic, and as such, ac cording to the modern enlighteiiej practice of civilized nations, they were entitled to bo dealt with us prisoners of war. At the date when this niessago is printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with tho Zelaya government for reasons made public In a communication to the for mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and is Intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with Its dignity, its duty to American In terests: cud Its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization.

In the far east this government pre serves unchanged its ioltcy of support ing the principle of equality of oppr tunlty niui scrupulous respect for the Integrity of the i'ldiuMe empire, to which iKiiley nre pledged the interest ed powers of both east and west. Ily the treaty of ItuKl China has. un dertaken the abolition of likiu with n nutlcrate and proportlouatw raising of the customs tariff along with currency reform. These reforms being a mani fest advantage to foreign commerce an well us to tho Interests of -(China, this government" Is oj alienor lug to facili tate these treasures and tho needful acquiescence" of the treaty powers. When It appeared that Chinese llkln revenues were to be hyiothocated to foreign bankers In connection with a great railway project It was obvious that the governments whose nationals held this loan would have a certalu direct Interest in the question of the carrying out by China of the reforms in question. The administration deem ed American participation to be of great national interest. Ilapplly, when t was as a matter of broad policy ur gent that this opportunity should not be lost, the Indispensable instrumental ity presented Itself when u group of American bankers of international reputation and gre;it resources agreed at once to share iu the loan upon pre cisely such terms as this government should approve. The chief of the.se terms was that American railway ma terial should be Umii an exact equality with tlntt of the other nationals Join ing in the loan In the placing of or ders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation, of Americans seems at last assured. ' In out; of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions of Sept. 1 of this year thera was a provision which caused consid erable, public apprehension In that upon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along the South Manchuriau and Antuug-Muk-den mi! roads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise, te take part In which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough exanilnalion of the conven tions ami of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed the conclusion that no such monop oly was Intended or accomplished. This government made Inquiry of the Imparl:1.! Chinese and Japanese gov ernments and received from ejich olll clal assurance that the provision had no purpose Inconsistent with the poli cy of equality of opportunity to which the signatories. In comnmn with the United Stjites. are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial, as usual. The arrangement of VMS for a co-operative control cd the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which -Is terminable in VM2 H already receiving the study of both countries. The Department of State. I earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress the esti mates submitted by the department of state ami most especially the legisla tion suggested In the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop aud make permanent the reorganization of tho department upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly ef ficient Instrument In the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American Interests abroad. Under a provision of the act of Aug. P, 11K)1). I have appointed three officials to assist the officers of the government iu collecting information necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of Aug. 0, t'.HJ!). As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of tho treasury department and as to matters of the needs and the exigencies of our manufacturers und exporters with the department of commerce and !alor In Its relation to the domestic nspoct of tho subject of foreign commerce. As a consequence of section 2 of tho tariff act of Aug. 1!)00, It becomes the duty of the secretary of state to con duct us diplomatic business all the negotiations necessary to place blm In a position to advise me as to whether or not n particular country unduly dis criminates against the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. Government Expenditures and Rev enues. Terhaps the most Important ques tion presented to this administration Is that of economy In expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The report of tho secretary shows that tho ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June yo, 1910. will exceed t ho estimated re ceipts by $31,075.(51:0. If to this deficit nre added the sum to be disbursed for tho Panama canal, amounting to $33, 000,000. and $1,000,000 to be paid on tho public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expendltureswlll bo In creased to a total deficit of $73. 075,0-0. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing tho Panama canal. I approve this pro posal. The Panama Canal. The policy of paying for tho con struction of the Panama canal not out of curreut revenue, but by bond Issue, was adopted In the Spooner act of VM2, and there seems to be no good reasou for departing from the princi ple by which n part at least of the burden of tho cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity, who are to enjoy It, aud there is all the moro rea son for this view becauso the actual cost to date of tho canal, which Is now half done and which will be completed Jan. 1, 1015, shows that the cost of engineering and construction will be $2J7,7(U'..00O Instead of $130,705.2O, as originally estimated. In addition to engineering and construction, the oth er expenses. Including sanitation and government and the. amount paid for the prHrllcs. the franchise and the privilege of building the canal, In crease the cost by $75. 135.M9 b total of $.".73,201,000. The Increase In the cost vt engineering and construc tion U due to a substantial enlarge ment of the plan of construction by. widening the canal 100 feet iu the Cu lebra cut antl by Increasing tho dl mcnsi.ms of the locks, to the under estimate of the quantity of tho work to bo done under the original plan and to an underestimate of the cost of la bor and materials, both of which haTe greatly enhanced .In price since the orlgjhal estimate was made. Government Economy. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year I directed the heads of departments In the prepara tion of their estimates to make them as low as possible consistent w ith Im perative governmental necessity. The result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of the treasury ,' that the estimates of the expenses of the gov ernment for the fiscal year ending June DO, lDU-that is, for the next fiscal year-are less by $55,003,000 than tho total of appropriations for the current fiscal year and less by $1)1.000,000 than the estimates for that year. So far as the secretary of the treasury Is able to form a judgmeut as to future income, there will be uo deficit in the year ending June 30, 11)11, but n small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs of the departments and of the gov ernment have been cut to the quick. For the purpose of securing Informa tion which may enable the executive and the legislative branches to unite In n plan for the permanent reduction ot the cost of governmental adminis tration the treasury department has Instituted an Investigation by one of the most sklllinl expert accountants In the United Stiites. The object of the Investigation li to devise ineaus to In crease the average efficiency of each employee. There Is great room for im provement toward this end, not only by the reorganization of bureaus and departments and in the nvoidance of duplicatiein, but also in the treatment of the Individual employee. Under the present system It constant ly happens that two employees receive the same salary when tho work of one Is far more difficult and Important and exacting Hum that of the other. Su perior ability is not rewarded or eu cou raged. Civil Pension. As the degree of efficiency In all tho , departments Is much lessened by the re- teiitlein of old employees who have out Jlvoel their energy and usefulness It Is indispensable to any proper system of economy that provision bo made so that their separation from tho servlco shall bo easy and Inevitable. It Is Im possible to make such provision unless there is adopted n plan of civil pen sions. We cannot, In view of the ad vancing prices of living, hope to save money by n reduction In the standard of salaries p.ild. Indeed, If any change is made In that regard an Increaso rather than n decrease will be neces sary, and the only means of economy will be In reducing the number of employees and iu obtaining a greater average of efficiency from those re tained In the service. Frauds In the Collection of Customs. I regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in tho collection of the customs rerenuo at New York city, in which n number of the subordinate employees In tho weighing aud other departments were directly concerned and In which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Kefining company and others. Tho frauds consisted In the payment of du ty on underweights of sugar. The gov ernment has recovered from tho Amer ican Sugar Refining company all that U Is shown to have been defrauded of. Tho sum was received In full of the amount due which might have been recovered by civil action against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an excess reservation In the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not Interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who was found to bo subject to the same. Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding against a number of the gov ernment officers. The treasury de partment an'd the department of Jus tice are exerting every effort to dis cover all the wrongdoers, Including tho officers and employees of the compa nies who may have been privy to tho fraud. U would seem to mo that an investigation of the frauds by con gress at present, pending tho probing by the treasury department and tho department of Justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and other wise prove nn embarrassment in se curing conviction of the guilty parties. Maximum and Minimum Clause In Tariff Act. Two features of tho new tariff net call for special reference. In order that the maximum duty shall be charg ed against tho imports from a country it Is necessary that tho executive shall find on the part of that country not only discriminations lu Its laws or the practice uuder them against tho trade of tho United States, but that the dis criminations found shall be undue that Is, without good aud fair reason. No ono is seeking a tariff war or a con dition in which tho spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. Tariff Readjustment. The new tariff law enables mo to ap Iolut a tariff board to assist me lu con nection with tho department of state lu the d ministration of the minimum and maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the government In tho administration of the entire law. I be llevo that the wjrk of this board will lo of prime utility and Importance whenever congress shall deem It wise again to readjust the customs duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a character as to show gen erally that tho rates of duties Imposed by the present tariff law nre oxcesslvo under tho principles of protection as described In tho platform of the sue-' cessful party at the Mate election I shall not hesitate to invite the atten tion ofcongrcss to this fact and ta the necessity for action predicated there on. Nothing, however, halts business and Interferes with the course of pros porlty so much ns the threatened rert slou of the tariff, and until the facts are at hand, after careful and deliber ate Investigation, upon which such re vision can properly be Undertaken, It seems to me unwise to attempt it. . War Department. In thojnterost of Immedlato econ omy I have required a reduction in tho estimates of tho war department for tho coming fiscal year which brings the total estimates down to an amount forty-live millions' less than fie 'corresponding 'estimates" for last I ear. This could be accomplished only hy cutting off new projects and sus pending for the period of one year all progress In military matters. l'or the same reason I have directed that tho army shall not bo recruited up to its present' authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than tenqiorary, for I nm sure that the In terests of tho military establishment are seriously In need of careful con sideration by congress. The secretary of war calls attention to a number of needed changes In the army. In all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most em phasis Is the need for an elimination bill providing n method by which the merits of officers shall have some ef fect upon their advancement and by which the advancement of all may bo accelerated by the effective elimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient. The military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that It would be unwise to make tho large expendi tures which at one time wero contem plated in the establishment of a naval base and station iu tho Philippine Is lands and huve expressed their judg ment. In which I fully concur, In fa vor of making nn extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not In the Philippines. The Navy. . Tho return of the battleship fleet from Its voyage around the world In metre efficient condition than when it started was a noteworthy event of in terest alike to our citizens and tho naval authorities of the world. The marked success of the ships in steam ing around the world In all weathers on schedule time has Increased respect for our navy and has added to our na tional prestige. It Is a regrettable fact that tho higher Officers are old for the respon sibilities of the modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate train ing in their duties as flag officers. Owing to tho necessity for economy in expenditures, 1 have directed the curtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are thirty-eight millions less thahvthe cor responding estimates of last year, and the request for new naval construction Is limited to two first class battleships and one repair vessel. . The secretary of the uavy has Inau gurated a tentative plan Involving cer tain changes in the organization of the uavy department, including the navy yards, all of which have been fouud by the attorney general to be In ac cordance with law. I have approved the execution of the plan proposed lie cause of tho greater efficiency and economy it promises. Department of Justice Expedition In Legal Procedure. The deplorable delays In the admin istration of civil and criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American liar association aud of many state bar associations ns well us the considered thought of Judges and jurlnts. In my judgmeut, a chauge lu public procedure, with a view to re ducing Its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating tho dis patch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases, consti tutes tho greatest need In our Ameri can institutions. I do not doubt for ono moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited In lynch ings are directly due to the uncertain ties and Injustice growing out of tho delays iu trials, Judgments and the exe cutions thereof by our courts. I therefore recommend legislation providing for the appointment by tho president of a commission with author ity to examine the law and equity proceuuro of the federal courts of first Instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to the supreme court and the costs Imposed In such procedure upon the privnto litigants and upon the public treasury and make recommendation with a view to simplifying and ex pediting the procedure as far ns pos sible and making It as Inexpensive as may bo to the litigant of little -means. The platform of the successful party In tho last election contained the fol lowing: Injunctions .Without Notice. "Wo. believe that the rules of proce dure In the federal courts with respect to the issuance of. tho writ of injunc tion should be more accurately deflued by statute and that no Injunction or temporary restraining order should bo Issued without uotlce, except where Irreparabio .Injury, would result from delay, in which-case a 'speedy hearing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that In compliance with the promise thus made appropriate leg islation bo adopted. Moreover, every such injunction, or restraining order issued without previous notice and op portunity by the defendant to be heard should by force" of the Rtatute expire and bo of.no effect after seven days from the Issuauce thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may tlx unless within such seven days or such less period tho In junction or order Is extcuded or re newed after previous notice and op portunity to be heard. Anti-trust and Interstate Commerce Laws. The Jurisdiction of the general gov. eminent over Interstate commerce has led to the passage of tho so called "Sherman anti-trust law" and the "in terstate eotntaerce 1 law' and its amendments. JThe developments In the operation of thoso laws call for a dl. eusslon and some suggestions s to amendments. These p,ofi.r u, f tody lu a special message. Poetoffice Department Second Clu.

I believe postal suvltigs banks to ho necessary In. order to offer a prope inducement to thrift and saving great many people of small meaiy, do not now have banking facility i to whom such n system wouldV.-,uu-opportunity for the accumulation of capital. They will furnish a satisfactory substitute, bused on sound piinciplo and actual successful trial in nearly all the countries of the world, for tho system of government guaranty of deposits now being adopted in several western states which, with deference to thoso who advocate It. seems to ine to have In it the seeds of demoraliza tion to conservative banking and cer tain financial disaster. Ship Subsidy. Following the course of my distin guished predecessor, I earnestly rec ommend to congress the consideration aud passage of a ship subsidy bill. Interior Department -New Mexico and Arizona. Tlit successful party iu the last elec tion in Its national platform declared In favor of the admission as separate states of New Mexico and Arizona, aud I recommend that legislation ap propriate to this end be adopted. Alaska. With respect to the territory of Alas ka, I recommend legislation which, shall provide for the appointment by the president of a governor and also of an executive council, the members of which shull during their term of office reside lu the territory and which shall have legislative powers sullielent to enable it to give to the territory lo cal laws adapted to Its present growth. I strongly deprecate legislation looking; to tho election of a territorial legisla ture iu that vast district. Conservation of Natural Resources. In several departments there is pre sented the necessity, for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national resources, and the sub ject Is one of such Importance us to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can bo entered upon In this communication. Tor that rea son shall take an early opportunity to send a special message to congress. The White Slave Trade. There 1 urgent necessity for addi tional legislation and greater executive activity to suppress the recrultiug of tho ranks of prostitutes from tho streams of immigration into this coun try an evil which, for waut of a bet ter uame, has been called "the white slave trade." Bureau of Health. There seems to bo no reason why all the bureaus and offices In the general government which have to do with the public health or subjects nkia thereto should not bo united In u bu reau to be called tho "bureau of pub lic health." Political Contributions. I urgently recommend to congres that a law be passed requiring that cuudldates in -elections of members of the house of representatives aud com mittees in chargo of their candidacy and campaign file in a proper ollice of the United States government a state ment of the contrihutious received und of the expenditures incurred in tu campaign for such elections and that similar legislation be enacted In re spect to all other elections which iro constitutionally within the control of congress. ' Conclusion. Speaking' generally, the country is in a high stato of prosperity. There 1 every reuson to believe that we are 011 tho eve of a substantial business ex pansion,. aud wo havo Just garnered a uarvest.uiicxampled in tho market val ue of our agricultural products.. The high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community; but,' ou the other hand, they mean a very considerably increas ed burden upon those classes In the community whose yearly compeusatioa docs not expand with the improvement Iu business and tho general prosperity. Various reasons are given for the hijja prices. The proportlotiato Increase iu the output of gold, which today is lm chief medium of exchange and Is some resects a measure of value, fur nishes a substantial explanation of at least part of tho Increaso lu prices. Tho Increase In population ond the. more expensive mode of living of tuo pcople. which have not been accom panied by a proportionate increase m acreage production., may furnish a fur ther reason. It Is well to note Hint tno Increase In the cost of living is i confined to this country, but Prcrfl' the world over, and thot those wjo would chargo increases lu prices to tno existing protective tariff must, mces tho fact that the rise In prices 1 nn taken place almost, wholly " 1 , products of the factory nnd farm m respect to which tbero has been eitner uu iiicieut iu iuv i. , Instances a very consldernblo rcduc-i tlon.
