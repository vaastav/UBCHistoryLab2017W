THE LEDGER Publüthcd every Saturday. BOWEN & BROTHER, EDITORS & PROPRIETORS, NEWARK, the go in its of to DELAWARE. Oue dollar and a bait a year In advance. Entered at the PosUiltlce at Newark cluaa matter. second Saturday, December 10, 1887. Considerable of our spaco is tnken up this week by wide-awake business men with advertisements. The columns of this paper are now ■eagerly sought after by those who appreciate how to increase their sales. It is a disastrous mistake for those engaged in any branch of in dustry to seek means of making known what they have for sale other than through the columns of some newspaper. Circulars promiscuous ly thrown around, may return a profit to the merchant, but in no comparison to a display advertise ment in the columns of a readable paper. Even business cards in large magazines do not catch the eye of the very persons who read the con tents of the magazine, but not so in a newspaper. Every line of" print, whether reading or advertisement, is brought clearly and forcibly before the reader. No chance of escape, and hence the advertiser reaps the greatest reward. So we say to those who contemplate spending money in the way of advertising their goods, —Use the columns of a newspaper. No other means will pay so hand somely. It is the only legitimate way. This issue of The Delaware Ledger closes volume X. On the first day of July, 1884, The Ledger became our charge, and the sheet was still in its swaddling clothes. We went cheerfully to work, and worked earnestly, and here Four years and over we have tried to make The Ledger bright and entertaining. Have we succeed ed? We don't know, as we have never heard a word. We take it for granted that our labors have been appreciated, as nearly all of the old subscribers still take the paper, and a host of new ones have been added. We have made enemies, and we have gained friends. To those who think we have harmed them inten tionally, they are mistaken. It nt ver shas been our intention to say aught against any honest man. We try to do our duty. Does every man do this? we are. a The Ledger is smiling, happyi and fat, and is going to re main in Newark until the last citi zen goes. During the coming year, we make no promises, but we want many more subscribers. Those who get the paper, show it to your neighbor get them to take it. Advertisers appreciate The Led ger as they know its circulation ex tends to those whom they are seek ing. We also suggest to our subscrib ers to keep each copy of the paper, and in after years it will afford much valuable information. Volume Ten closes with many thanks to all for past favors. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Message of the President of the United States was read before Congress on Tuesday. The docu ment is brief and to the point. It shows that Mr. Cleveland is eminent ly fitted for the position he fills. The document lias "caused more earnest comment than any one since the days of Andrew Jackson." It is not of the stereotyped expressions, but it is a vigorous, presentation of ideas that demand attention by Congress. The message says at one place: "This simple and plain duty which we e tlie people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economical operation of the government amt to re store to the business of the country the money which we hold in tiro treasury through perversion of governmental powers. These things can and should be done with safety to all without danger to the opportunity To remunerative labor which industrie orking need, and with benefit to them nnd sill our people by cheapening their means of subistence I increasing the ensure of their comfort. The comments of the press throughout the country speak highly of the docu ment: Neu > York Times, Mu y trump: There nothing hut praise for the document. is New York World: We congratulate the Democratic party and Mr. Cleveland himself upon his bold, sagacious and statesmanlike action. New York Eceniuy World, Bern.: The country and the Democratic party are to be congratulated on the President's sa gacity and courage in seizing upon and 'or.-ing to the front the paramount issue of our politics. Dh'dndclphia Record, Jnd. Dan.: Plant ing himself unreservedly upon the plat form of the revenue reformers, he advo cates tax reduction by an enlargement of the free list ami by lowering the duties on the sage is of more th not only because of the flange condition which embarrasses the busi ness of the country, but because it is a formal declaration* of the issue in the next Presidential contest. sauries of living.

There is no n them in any party which sustains Mr Cleveland. • go over to • room for Hotv amusing it is to hear some Republicans giving their views on the President's Message. The Chica go Tribum says: "The Message is able and statesmanlike, business in style, perspicuous in statement, clear in its reasoning and irrefutable in its conclusions. The message rises above party lines, and presents a common basis of patriotic states manships on which Republicans and Democrats are bound by every con sideration of the public • welfare and of political expediency to stand to gether," etc. How does this sound to those who are making such feeble cries about the messago for its "de fective information," and its "hack neyed arguments?" "Revenue Refonn" is what the people want, and President Cleve land, in his able message, asks Con gress to consider and act on this great vital question. It is no kid gloved message: it is a message written by a man who possesses the manhood to back np his honest con victions. . In respecting Jeremiah Harrigan instead of pardoning him, as he ex pected, he broke out into a fit of rago. He should be thoughtful that the Governor did not let the law take its course. The respite ends March 31st, 1891. Herr Most will pass a year in jail. It don't do for a man to use violent language in supporting his cause. The object of third and fourth class postmasters to secure more compensation for labor performed is certainly worthy of just considera tion. To pay them better salaries would no doubt be a good way to reduce the surplus in the Treasury. The nominations made by the recent Episcopal convention to name Bishops Lee's successor, have been rejected, and six month will elapse before another convention will con vene. James Donaldson, a passenger on the Alesia, so long quarantined at this port, died at his home at New Bedford, Pa., of a strange disease resembling cholera. In order to prevent the total destruc tion of game in Wisconsin, a deer park of 10,000 acres is to be laid out and pro tected in the northern part of the State. The Holidays And the colder winter weather are now rapidly approaching. The joyful season is eagerly anticipated by young folks in thousands of homes ; but in nearly all there are one or more older ones to whom the cold waves and the storms mean renewed suffering from rheuma tic back limbs.
