Practically th- t-ntire time of the senate today was de- j voted to the introduction of bills and f resolutions. i wo of these measures, relating to the suppression of anarchy and dealing with anarchists, were al lowed to lie on the table so that their authors. Mr. Mcl'omas of Maryland and Mr. Vest of Missouri, may bring them to the early attention of the sen ate. The isthmian canal report was transmitted to the senate by the presi dent and several bills providing for the construction of the water way. one r-i them by Mr. Morgan of Alabama, v.-ho has led the movement for the canal in the past, were presented. The Vest resolution directs the judi ciary committee to inquire if congress has power to legislate for the punish ment of anarchists who assassinate or attempt to assassinate a president o the United States, and if not, whether it is expedient to amend the federal constitution to enable congress to so legislate. ' Also whether it is necessary or expe dient to so amend the federal constitu tion as to empower congress to prevent by such means as may be deemed nec essary the teaching by anarchists of the doctrine that all governments should be destroyed: also whether it is necessary or expedient so to amend the federaJ constitution that congress shall have power to punish ali persona belonging to anarchistic associations, also what amendment, if any, is neces sary to the naturalization laws to pre vent the coplrjr trio tUi.i ountr' nt anarchists and their becoming citizens of the United States; also whether it is necessary or expedient to so amend tie federal constitution as to give congress power to establish a p-?nal colony on some suitable island under the jurisdic tion r-. f tho t'Tiif (r Ktn tR tn u'hir'i after trial and conviction, every chist holding the doctrine that all gov ernment should be destroyed by the assassination of their chief rulers shall be deported, and that the committee, after due examination and Inquiry, shall recommend to the senate such amendments to the federal constitution may be necessary to prevent th teaching and promulgation or anarchic- Hi;, many friends -will be pleased to al doctrines in the I'nited State..

At any rate I must do something, so I quit drinking coffee altogether and took on Postum, and also began the u:-:p f Grape-Nuts Tlreakfast Food. In a short time I began to enjoy life again.

That act, .whicii was approved May 5, ISirj, extruded the Chinese Indefinitely, but the Scott act of November 3. 1S93, limited the exclu sion to tn years. In case there is no legislation in the meantime the ten year limit will expire next May. In addition to Senator Lodge's bill for the continued exclusion of the Chinese, similar bills were presented by Senators Mitchell, Fairbanks, Stewart, Quuy and Penrose. Senator Mitchell's bill also applies to the exclusion of the Japanese and Filipinos and their descendants a well as to the descendants Chinese.

Wants Isolation In Sleeping Car The Difficulty of Establishing Moving Quarantine For Tuberculosis Pa tient On Account of Wrong Diag nosis of Disease. New York, Dec. 4. Agitation by th? Travelers' Protective association in a movement initiated by that organiza- courage the hope that any furth progress for the attainment of the ob j-tri ruugui can oe expecieu irom ir.e method adopted for that purjose. Prae ticuily the matter has been ignored by the Western Passenger association, to which the subject was fii-Kt presented. At least, that may be construed as being the effect of its action in deciding that the matter is one to be dealt with by the Pulhnan company alone, as tiiat 01 yorainiii u a as anu controls tne t sleeping cars. It is o be brought before the Trans i ontinontal Passenger association at its meeting next month, but the result will probubiy be the same as in the other vase. It Is understood that the sleeping car company has made p'ain the fact that it will not pay the slight est attention to the matter. That it doea not appreciate the importance and necessity of protecting its. patrons and is not doing ail in its power to provide scientific hygiene and correct sanita tion. Is not to be assumed, because it Is not disposed to introduce the departure asked for by the commercial travelers. It3 disposition is shown in the state ment of cne of its oi.Wts. who says: 'Every car is fumigated at the end of each trio and if a berth is foun.l that has been oc t-upit d by a person raftering from a contagious disease the tecding 13 destroyed.

However wise and prudent the isolation demanded. It must be rcmcmb-red that consumptives themselves would set up the strongest cf opposition to the measure, an ! doubt has been expressed that a law making t compulsory could be enforced. It would require the employment of a doctor to inspect passengers and such a r'gulation would mean delay and cetoi.Uon o.' trains. It would Interfere with the proper operation of railroads. The inspec tion could only be main tained at important points and con sumptive pa"", nil i s w ould be able to board a train nt other stations unn o-l"-t-d. Passengers would also rebel agninst such an e xamination. About the b-st tint can he done, it would ap pear, is to maintain the strictest clean liness possible, with proper sanitary regulations, not the least of which uld be the prohibition of th practice of n ing on car floors, which is now altogether too prevalent In railroad cn':- :f all descriptions, except sleeping and parlor cars. FOUNDER SMYTHE PLEASED Finds Especial Cause for Rejoicing In the Message. Pan Hlego, Oal.. Dec. 4. "William Tl.

"The day of non-political agitation i over. The day for political action is come. From this lime henceforth irri gation is to be a conspicuous issue In national politics, and I predict that In the west, particularly in California, it Is to he the overshadowing issue in state noiitirs. "The president's specific recom mendations are in line with the most enlightened ruldle sentiment, including the views o" scientific men in the gov ernment service and universities. "His roiiey for forest protection is beyond criticism. It will cave the tim ber and water supply for the use of the present and fiitur generations. Hi policy for national storage works is marvelously sound, since it provides for the reclamation of the rational domain without infringing upon the rights of the state. He wants the nation to store floods nnd regiilr the How cf streams, but he wisely stopped there. He recog nises thnt the distribution of water i the function o thi? slates. Inseparable from their toverignty. and still further and better, he sees tht the existing water laws in most states must be re formed before it will be safe for the nation to store their waters and mingle them with the common flood of the Ftrearn. "Otherwise existing rights would be imperilled and the public lands might be cheated of suoplies Intended for their use. Thus the national adminis tration lends its great influence to the Cause of state reform which has been waged unceasingly against the pow erful interests seeking to make a pri vate monopoly of this indispensable element of national wealth."

CUBAN RECIPROCITY. Governor Wood Points Out the Jus lice of It. Washington. Dec. 4. General Leo nard Wood, governor of Cuba, was at the capitol today conferring with sen ators in the interest ot Cuban rot rocity. He told the senators that some measure by reciprocity on Cuban sugar and tobacco, narticularly the former, was essential to giving the island that degree of stability of prop erty, which wan contemplated wTien the United States dispossessed it of Span ish rule. RAILROAD PROBLEMS Rates in the West and the Increisiagf ! Car Famine, I New York, Dec. 4. Representatives of practically every railroad running west cut of Chicago, with the exception cf the Great Northern, held a meeting today in this city. The business of the session was unusually brief. It was en tirely routine and had to do chiefly with the maintaining cf freight and passenger rates through the vast coun try traversed by these roads. Perhaps the most serious problem which has presented itself to railroad men is the increasing car famine which at this time taxes the capacity of all the more important railroads. No con clusion was reached on this point, but it was suggested that it might be nec essary to make a per diem charge in stead of a mileage charge for the use of cars. THE CHINESE COURT It Will Be In Pekin By January The Reason Given For the Delay Is the Illness of the Impress Dow agerSeveral Customs Disputes Have Arisen. Pekin, Dec. 4. An edict has been re ceived fixing January 11 as the date for the arrival of the court at Pekin. The reason given for the delay is the illnei'3 of the dowager empress. Prince Ching arrived at Paoting-fu today. He will meet there Prince Chun, brother of the emperor, who re cently returned from Germany. The latter is en route to Kaifeng-fu. Captain Brewster today handed over the temple of agriculture to the Chi nese. Major Kobertson was ill and touid not be present at the ceremony. Captain Brewster acting In his stead. Hu Yu Fen, military governor of Pe kin, in thanking the Americans, said that the temple Wii3 in a better state of preservation than any of tne prop erty that had been held by the allies. Its condition, he addec, was In marked contrast to that of the tern pie of hea ven, which thu Chinese declare the i:igliFh looted of bronze urns and other valuable. Since the temple of heaven was returned to the Chinese even th bronze hardware and nails in the build ing hai been stolen. The- temple of agitculture was the last important building held by the al lies in Peliin. The ministers have declined to an swer the .request made by Sir Itobert Hart, imperial commissioner of mari time customs, for an interpretation of certain paria of the protocol in regard to the customs. The question was brought up by the rimugsling into Chefoo of a cose of firearms. In furmr times th?se would have been confiscated by the Ch'.nse ofiicials, but such action now would deficit the intention of the protocol. There are alao several disputes in re gard to certain cargoes, the importers claiming that they are extmpt from ihe 5 per cent effective duty because they were shaped within the "limit of te.i days after the signing of the protocol and were delayed en route. There is a large margin for fraud in these mat ters. Sir Root rt Hart will instruct his subordinates in the customs depart ment to be liberal in their decisions of technical cjuestions. M.
