Contrary to our usual custom, lhe Democrat will issue no Christmas paper this year. Circumstances over which we exercised no control con spired to defeat our well-laid plans in that direction. The circumstances ore the same one which are causing a good many people of this state quite a bit of grief, viz: The switchmen's strike. We had planned to issue a holiday paper far superior to any ever pub lished in this neck o' the woods. It was to be printed on fine book paper. It was to be handsomely illustrated and to contain sixteen or twenty pages of specially prepared matter of more than passing local interest. The auts are here all right, all right, a dozen or more of them, including a full-page composite picture of Fergus aounty ranch and crop scenes, the finest thing of the sort ever pub lished here. The matter was in course of preparation and a number •f the business houses of the city had spoken for space in the publication. But somewhere in this frozen strike infested land between the Twin €ities and the Inland Empire freight car containing several hundred pounds of fine book paper. Switched •n to some far away side-track is very essential part of what was des tined to be a work of art and a joy forever. If wishing would scoot it along up this way, that car would hustle along in a hurry. If swearing would move it, we would even he tempted to induce some of our pro fane friends to let out a few cusses. But there she is, down in western Minnesota or Dakota or eastern Montana, unmoved, unmoving and, the roseate promises of the traffic man agers to - the contrary notwithstand ing, apparently immovable. We could get out a big paper on "•rdinary news print of which we al ways have on hand an abundant sup ply, but our cuts were built for book paper of the finest sort. We could get it out and eliminate the pictures but that would be contrary to the policy of the Democrat. If we are unable to exceed former efforts, we must content ourselves with the cruel mandate of fate and cut out the big umber. We would not be satisfied to simply repeat past achievements and ♦lie thousands of Democrat reader who have been taught . to look for something a lot better each year would not be satisfied. '* While we have abandoned our ef forts to get out a fine holiday number the next issue of the Democrat will contain a few things out of the ordi ■ary run. There will be some good •riginal stories by local friends and review of conditions for the year in ■the Judith Basin They will be well worth reading, and compensate, in a measure, for the splendid treat which we had so painstakingly planned for •ur readers. A GIGANTIC STRIKE. What promises to be one of the Most gigantic strikes of laboring Men ever seen in this country threatened' Unless concessions are made, before the end of the present week, practically every line of rail road in the United States will be tied up and the business of the country will be at a stand still. The strike started about a week ago when the switchmen of the northwestern railroads walked out after being refused a demand for an increase in wages. Now switchmen ea the eastern roads are preparing to quit work and there is extreme probability of other unions of railroad employes joining in the strike, thus completely putting out of business the transportation facilities of the nation. It is impossible to conceive the tre mendous and far-reaching influences on the commercial life of the country which such a strike will exert. It will close down thousands of factories and mines and necessitate the laying off of laborers in every walk of life from one end of the nation to the other. No action of any set of men could cause such a complete demoral ization of business. Whether or not the men win the strike will depend very largely upon whether or not they deserve to win. If the employes' demands are just they will command the hearty sym pathy of the great mass of American people despite any inconveniences which their action might entail. And backed by public sympathy, the rail road men can bring the railroad com panies to terms. There is said to be very serious unrest among all of the railroad work of the country and one does not have to go far to find the reason for that unrest. Within the last two years, the prices of the ordinary necessities of life have advanced from twenty five to forty percent. The wages of the working men have shown no such increase with the result that while men were able to lay aside some money on their wages two or three years ago, they now have difficulty in meeting the ordinary living expenses. This has naturally brought about this crisis and it is going to continue to bring about crises in the lives of laboring men and of the people who are operating the smaller business enterprises of the country until a rad ical change in conditions is made. Then, too, the railroad companies have been reporting prosperous con ditions. The volume of business has jumped upward by leaps and bounds, big dividends have been declared and immense sums set aside as surplus. No fair-minded American objects to having the railroad companies make good profit on their investments. What they object to is to see them declaring dividends on a capitaliza tion which represents tens of millions of watered stock. But for this wat ered stock which has been the means of adding millions to the already bulky fortunes of our great "captains of industry," the great corporations such as the railroads could pay better wages to their men, reduce the cost of hauling passengers and freight and make splendid money on the capital actually invested. Thus, exorbitant prices for the necessities of life, which is due largely to an unjust and discriminat ing protective tariff, and the practice of so conducting business as to be able to declare dividends on paper which represents not one iota of real value may be set down as the twin causes of a strike which threatens to throw hundreds of thousands of peo ple out of employment, stagnate the business of the country and bring the gaunt form of hunger into innum erable homes in every part of our nation. THE 

SESSION OF CONGRESS. Anaconda Standard: The federal constitution provided that congress must meet at least once every year, and that the meeting shall be held on the first Monday in December, but it was recited that congress "may by law specify a different day." The congtess that meets next Monday was organized soon after the inaug uration of President Taft and it deatl with the tariff work of the extraor dinary session. This congress will be in existence until March 4, 1911. The reasons which made December a suitable time for the assembling of the two houses disappeared long ago. It is a well known fact that December is, in fact, not a good time for the meeting. It has long been the habit to loiter along, on the presumption that ser ious work will not be undertaken un til after the holidays. But plans for a change of date are mixed up with other plans for a change in the time for the inauguration of presidents. The accepted opinion seems to be that to change inauguration day would require a constitutional amend ment. In anticipation of the business of the session, the arithmetic politicians are figuring out the numerical strength of the insurgent forces. One roster which has been widely quoted figures up a fighting force of forty five house member^ In this list fif teen states are represented, although Massachusetts and Connecticut are the only New England states account ed for; out our way Montana, Wash ington, Oregon, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah are left out of the reckon ing. The insurgent force is credited .'ith one California rescruit, one from Idaho and three from Nebraska. The Middle West shows up strong in all the estimates. It is figured that the insurgent force can count on seven Minnesota men, four from Illinois six from Iowa, eight from Wisconsin with two Kansans. New York's quota is five members. Mr. Fowler, of New Jersey, is counted in and two Ohio men are included. The leaders in the insurgent movement believe that they can muster a working f<.r. . <• fifty men strong. If they can do that, there is no doubt that the insurgents can put up successful fight against Cannotiism. They could keep after the speaker and, before the present session ends, break him down. But, of course, the serious question is whether there can be a roundup of forty or fifty repub licans ujion whom reliance may be placed to go up against the Cannon machine first, last and all the time. There is reasonable doubt whether an organization answering that des cription ca n be formed and main tained. The near future is liable to reveal the fact that some of these house members propose to be insurgent on certain propositions only. Unless things prove to be unlike what they were during the recent extra session, powerful agencies will work upon these men with the idea of compelling them to get in and drill with the ma chine. Probably toward that end white house pressure will be brought to bear before the new year is many weeks old. The president has interest in sev eral important measures. Before these are handled in the house, Mr. Taft will probably be told that he must deliver insurgent votes for Can non purposes in order to secure a ma jority for Taft measures However, the signs betoken a lively fight with a session of turmoil and personal con flict and the consequent delay of bus iness. 

BEHIND TARIFF BUILDERS. Butte News: With tihe admision of Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania that a "constituent of his," a watch works manufacturer, wrote the para graph of the tariff schedule covering the duty on watch works, the people are beginning to realize the chicanery of the tariff builders. A few days ago the sensational statement was made that the sugar trust, through its representatives, had written the sugar schedule. Now it looks as' though the whole tariff Dill was peddled about the country among the "constituents" of the mighty sen ators, that the document was pre pared and written by those valiant guardians of the rights of the people, the trusts, and the proof will be forthcoming. And this is the tariff bill that Joseph G. Cannon calls the best the country ever had; this is the tariff bill which President Taft says is acceptable while it might be improved on; this the tariff bill that Aldrich unqual ifiedly approves because he sent it about the country to be tinkered by his constituents. The people did not write any portion of it; the people were not consulted. This is the tariff bill which those true representatives of the people Dolliver, La Follette, Cummins and Clapp, denounce as an outrage, a be trayal of trust and a violation of th promise made in convention to the people. , The facts which have already been brought to light prove this tariff bill to be not the result of any honest ef fort to give the people what they de mand and what they are entitled to, but the simple carrying out of the will of the trusts and the high financial powers of the country to which the senators and representatives who shaped the tariff bill have sold them selves and whose active agents they have at all times proven themselves to be. Aldrich carried the tariff bill to the Standard Oil trust to be written; Smoot carried it to the sugar trust and the Mormon church, which is the partner of the trust; Penrose carried it to his watchmakers. It is only question of time before further facts will show that other senators carried the bill to the tobacco trust, tihe coal trust, the lumber combine, the beet trust and ajl the other monopolies \ which the American poeple have de termined to circumscribe and to quil ify because of their flagrant violations of the law. , The people who hoped their repre sentatives lhad contrived to reduce the extortion of trusts and trust prices have been hoodwinked again in the tariff bill and the trusts have added another load to the burden the peo ple are obliged to carry. Judith Basin Star: In all the world there is no country where such great, varied and valuable crops are pro duced as on the farms in the great Judith Basin. Markets are near every acre of this land. The railroads ab orb the surplus and transport it to he market centers of the country or world. And that which is left be hind will not be sold for a cent less than what it could be sold for farther away; or putting it in another way, nothing will be shipped away for less than it will bring at home. In other words good prices prevail every here. The good crop means an abundance of distributed new wealth in the Basin. The constitution of this country ex plicitly prohibits congress from do ing anything restricting free speech, nevertheless, a few federal judges are attempting to do that very thing by sending Mitchell, Gompers and Mor rison to jail because they exercised their constitutional right of speaking freely. But repeating a famous re mark, the officers of the Manufac turers' Association have doubtless asked these federal judges, "What is the constitution between friends?" Doctor Cook, of North pode-Mount McKinley fame, has mysteriously dis appeared. On two other occasions Dr. Cook mysteriously disappeared. On one occasion, he brought back a thrilling story of the ascent of the highest peak on the continent; on the other return he brought news of the great discovery of modern or ancient times. It is just possible that he will turn up within a few weeks with the scalp of that other elusive projectile, the south pole, dangling at his belt. Don't swear at the railroad switch men because their strike has prevent ed the arrival of holiday goods. The bluest Christmas of all will be for the wives and children of these same strikers who have walked out, not be cause they desired to inflict any in convenience upon the people of this country but in an effort to make the big railroad companies pay a living wage. One bunch of political leaders in New York affirm that there is a "plot" to make Theodore Roosevelt governor of the Empire state. The Taft sup porters say that there is a "plot" to make the same Theodore Roosevelt president of the United States, all of which indicate that the return of the mighty African hunter is not looked forward to with any immense degree of pleasurable anticipation by the anti-plotters. Walter Wellman says that Doctor Cook is a fakir and utterly failed to attain the north pole as he claims Wellman ought to be an authority on both points He is pretty generally looked upon by the American peo ple as a first water fakir and his num erous unsuccessful attempts to get started toward the north pole should acquaint him with the elements of a failure. When Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage, received the evidence of gross frauds being perpetrated against the government by the sugar trust, he says that he sent them to President Havemeyer with his compli ments. And without doubt, President Havemeyer sent word to his lar cenous agents to go ahead with the steal, wit h his compliments . Some crank has stepped to the front with the idiotic suggestion that inasmuch as our forests are being de nuded of several million growing bushes every year on account of the demand for Christmas trees, that de lightful adjunct to our great holiday pastime be dispensed with. There is yet work for the fool-killer. President Taft's message recom mends more legislation than congress could legislate into existence in ten sessions. It is extremely probable that the legislators will be so con fused by the assignment handed them by the president that they will chuck the whole mess and put in their time in the good old way, doing nothing. Andway, its fine weather for winter wheat. Mr. Would-be Ambassador Crane, of Chicago, has doubtless sent a mes sage of sincerest condolence to Pres ident Zelaya. Both were pasted with the same stuffed club. It is stated that President Taft's message to congress contains from fifteen to twenty thousand words. It would require several volumes of verbosity for the president to fully explain his reactionary attitude on public questions to the American peo ple. Is This Bank Your Bank ?
