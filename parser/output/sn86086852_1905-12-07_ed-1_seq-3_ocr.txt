ADMIT ALIENS 01 THEIR MERITS DECLARES THE PRESIDENT IN HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. INSURANCE SUPERVISION It Should Be Dene by the Federal Government —Better Care of Wo men to Guard Against Race Suicide —Contributions to Political Parties by Corporations Decried. Washington, Dec. 1. —in bis mes sage to congress President Roosevelt traversed the whole gamut of national affairs. He urged the admission of every foreigner, be he Jap, Chinaman, dago or what not entirely on his own merits; pleaded for better laws regu lating the employment of women that race suicide might not continue; damned the smoke nuisance at Wash ington and suggested prison sentences for violators of the anti-smoke law; declared that the power of courts to issue Injunctions must not be weak ened; believed that the notorious ex travagance in the government print ing at Washington should be reduced; favored the close regulation of rail ways and Insurance companies; asked for a federal pure food act; expressed satisfaction with the rise of the navy, spoke for loyal support for the panama canal and discussed a score of other subjects. The fortunes amassed through cor porate organization are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, ho said in opening, as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the government, some effective power of supervision over their cor porate use. In order to Insure a healthy social and industrial life, every big corporation should bo held responsible by, and bo accountable to, some sovereign strong enough to control Its conduct. Experience has shown that it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and super vision of these great corporations by state action. Such regulation and su pervision can only ho effectively exer cised by a sovereign whose jurisdic tion is coextensive with the field of work of the corporations—-that is, by the national government. The presi dent believes that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by congress. If this j proves Impossible, it will certainly bo : necessary ultimately to confer In full est form such power upon the national government by a proper amendment of the constitution. Rail Rates. The immediate and most pressing need is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents ‘of the government such supervision and regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country en gaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the Imposition of unjust or unreason able rates. It must Include putting a complete stop to rebates in every shape and form. The first considera tion to be kept in mind is that the power should he affirmative and should be given to some administrative body created by the congress. If given to the present Interstate commerce com mission or to a reoganlzed Interstate commerce commission, such commis sion should he made unequivocally ad ministrative. In the president’s Judg ment the most important provision which such law' should contain is that conferring upon some competent ad ministrative body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad Is reasonable and just, and if It la found to he unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investigation to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not he lawful to go— the maximum reasonable rate?—this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. It sometimes happens at present, not that a rate ts too high but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commis sion would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum; and it would need only one or two such decisions by the com mission to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper mini mum rates. The president called at tention to the fact that his proposal is not to give the commission power to Initiate or originate rates general ly. but to regulate a rate already fixed or olginated by the roads, upon com plaint and after investigation. A heavy penalty should be exacted from any corporation xvhlch falls to respect an order of the commission. The pres ident regards this power to establish a maximum rate as being essential to any scheme of real reform In the matter of railway regulation. The first necessity is to secure it; and unless It Is granted to the commission there is little use in touching the subject at all. illegal transactions often occur un der the forms of law It has often occurred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a large quan ttty of some commodity and then after It has been bought an pen raductlon lOWA 

COUNTY DEMOCRAT, MINERAL POINT. WIS„ THUKSHAY. DKCKMUKK 7. UUm. is made in the rate to take effect Immediately, the arrangement result ing to the profit of the one shipper and the one railroad and to the dam age of all their competitors; for it must not be forgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as any railroad in the matter of re bates. The law should make it clear so that nobody can fall to understand that any kind of commission paid on freight shipments, whether tn this form or In the form of fictitious dam ages, or of a concession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or payment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth while considering whether it would not be wise to confer on the govern ment the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would help stop what Is realty black mail. Elevator allowances should bo stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demor alizing and are used as rebates. All private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the interstate com merce commission or some similar body so far as rates, and agreements practically affecting rates, are con cern'd. The private-car owners and the owners of Industrial railroads are entitled to a fair and reasonable com pensation on their investment, but neither private cars nor industrial rail roads nor spur tracks should he util ized as devices for securing prefer ential rates. A rebate in icing charges or in mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. No lower rate should apply on goods imported than actually obtains on domestic goods from tho Ameri can seaboard to destination except in eases where water competition is the controlling influence. There should be publicity of the accounts of com mon carriers: no common carrier en gaged in interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the in spection of the government. Only In this way can violations or evasions of the law bo surely detected. The president declaed: "AVe wish to in sure as fair treatment for tire small town ns for the big city; for the small shipper as for the big shipper.” Block Signals. Roing to another subject the presi dent said that congress should pro vide, by appropriate legislation, for the introduction of block signals upon all railroads engaged In Interstate commerce at the earliest practicable date as a measure of increased safety to the traveling public. The exces sive hours of labor to which railroad employes in train service arc in many cases subjected Is also a matter which may well engage the serious at tention of congress. Child Labor and Women. The future of the nation depends upon the citizenship of the genera* lions to come; the children of today are those who tomorrow will shape the destiny of our land, and we can not afford to neglect thorn. The legis lature of Colorado has recommended that the national government provide some general measure for the protec tion from abuse of children and dumb animals throughout the United Stales. The president lays the matter before congress for what he trusts will he Us favorable consideration. The department of commerce and labor should also make a thorough in vestigation of the conditions ot wo men In Industry. Over 5,000,000 American women are now engaged in gainful occupations and there is need of full knowledge on which to base action looking toward state and mu nicipal legislation for the protection of working women. The introduction of women into industry is working change and disturbance in the domes tic and social life of the nation. The decrease in marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has been coincident with It. We must face accomplished facts, and the adjustment to factory conditions must ho made; but surely It can be made with less friction and less harmful < fleets on family life than Is now the case. This whole matter in reality forms one of the greatest ocinlogica! phenomena of our time; it Is a social question of the first 1m portance, of far greater Importance than any merely political or economic uestlon can he: and to solve it we need ample data, gathered In a sane and scientific spirit In the course of an exhaustive investigation. In discussing the labor problem the president said that, in addition to mere obedience to the law, each man. If he be really a good citizen, must show broad sympathy for his neighbor and genuine desire to look at any nuestlon arising between them from the standpont of that neighbor no less ban from his own: and to this end it is essential that capitalist and wage worker should consult freely one with •he other, should each strive to bring closer the day when both shall realize that they are properly partners and not enemies. Then he added: "This government Is not and never shall be government by a plutocracy. This gove nment is not and never shall be government by a mob. It shall con- Hnue to be In the future what It has oen In the past, a government based m the theory that each man, rich or ooor, Is to be treated simply and sole y on his worth as a roan, that all his ■ersona! and property rights are to c safeguarded, and that be Is neither o wrong others nor to suffer wrong rom other*.” Insurance. The great Insurance companies af ford striking examples of corporations whose business has extended so far beyond the Jurisdiction of the states which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by the parent states. Re cent events have emphasized the im portance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question, to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several states have boon to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has boon exposed, it has boon only too clearly shown that certain of the men at the head of those large corporations take but small note of the ethical distinction between hon esty and dishonesty: they draw the line only this side of what may be called law-honesty, the kind of hon esty necessary in order to avoid fall ing into the clutches of the law. Of course the only complete remedy for this condition must he found in an aroused public conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct in the com munity at large, and especially among business men and in the great pro fession of the law, and in the growth of a spirit which condemns all dis honesty, whether In rich man or in poor man. whether it takes the shape of bribery or of blackmail. There Is need of a far stricter and more uni form regulation of the vast insur ance Interests of this country. The United Slates should rti this respect follow the policy of othey nations by providing adequate national supervi sion of commercial interests which are clearly national In character. The lu* ability of a state to regulate effective ly Insurance corporations created un der the laws of other states and transacting the larger part of their business elsewhere is also clear. The eo-gross has already recognized that interstate Insurance may be proper subject for federal legislation, for In creating the bureau of corpora tions it autholzod It to publish and supply useful Information concerning interstate corporations. Including cor porations engaged in Insurance. It lls obvious that If the compilation of statistics he the limit of the federal power, It Is wholly ineffective to regulate this form of commercial In tercourse between the si at os, and as the insnralco business lias outgrown in magnitude the possibility of ade quate state supervision, congress j should carefully consider whether further legislation can he had. What is said above applies with equal force to fraternal and benevolent organiza tions which contract for life Insur ance. Federal Elections. j The president recommended the j enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption in federal elec tions and It should include severe pen alties against him who gives nr re- I oelves a bribe Intended to Influence I Ills act or opinion ns an elector; and ! provisions for the publication not only of the expenditures for nominations | and elections of all candidates, but al- Iso of nil contributions received and expenditures made by political com j mlttees.” If it is pm;alble to secure | by law the full and verified publication |in detail of all the sums contributed I to and expended by the candidates or | committees of any political parties the result can not but he wholesome. All contributions by corporations to i any political committee or for any political purpose should ho forbidden, I directors should not he permitted to i use stockholders’ money for such pur i poses; and, moreover, a prohibition of this kind would he, as far ns It went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at In corrupt practices acts. Not only should both the na tlonal and the several state leglsla lures forbid any officer of a corpora tion from using the money of the cor poration in or about any election, hut they should also forbid such use of money in‘connectlon with any legisla tion save by the employment of coun sel In public manner for distinctly legal services. Peace. The coming Hague conference was eulogized. The president declaring that “no object Is better worthy the attention of enlightened statesman ship than the establishment of a surer method than now exists of se curing justice as between nations, both for the protection of the little nations and for ’he prevention of war between the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not only to avert bloodshed, hut, above all, effectively to strengthen the forces of right." Speaking of the Monroe doctrine the president said that, In the first place we roust as a nation make It evident that we do not Intend to treat It in any shape or way as an excuse for aggrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. We must recognize the fact that in some South American countries there has been much suspicion lest we should Interpret the Monroe doctrine as in some way Inimical to their in terests, and we must try to convince all the other nations of (his continent once and for all that no Just and or dcrly government has anything to fear from us. This country he added, would certainly decline to go to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a Just oebt, on the other band, it is very Inadvisable to permit any foreign power to take pos session, even temporarily, of the cua tom-houses of an American republic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations: for such temporary occu nation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only escape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must ourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as possible of a Just obligation shall be paid. it is far better than this country should put through such an arrangement, rather than allow any foreign country to un derrake it; and This is what we are doing in Santo Domingo. The Army. Coming to the army and navy the president said that provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind so that the troops may learn how to take care of themselves under actual serv ice conditions; every march, for In stance, being made with the soldier loaded exactly as ho would be In an active campaign. Provision should he made for the exercise at least of a brigade and by preference of a divi sion in marching and embarking at some point on our coast and disem barking at some other point and eon tinning its march. The number of posts in which the army is kept In timo of peace should be materially diminished and the posts that are left made correspondingly larger. Promotion by mere seniority can never result in a thoroughly efficient corps of officers In the highest ranks unless there accompanies it a vigorous wood ing out process. Such a weeding out process—that is, such a process of so lection- Is a chief feature of the four years' course of the young officer at West Point. There ts no good reason why It should stop Immediately upon hts graduation. It does not seem to the 'president necessary that the navy should —at least In the Immediate future—-he In creased beyond the present number of units. What Is now clearly neces sary 1s to substitute efficient Tor Inef ficient units as the latter become worn-out or as It becomes apparent that they are useless, probably the result would he attained by adding a single battleship to our navy each year. There ts urgent need of pro vlding a largo Increase In the number of officers, and especially in the num ber of enlisted men. Recent naval his tory has emphasized certain lessons I which ought not to. hut which do, need emphasis. Seagoing torpedo boats or destroyers are Indispensable, not, only for making night attacks by surprise upon an enemy, hut even I' l battle for finishing already crippled ships. Under exceptional oiremn stances submarine boats would doubt less he of use. Fast scouts are needed. The main strength of the navy, however, lies and can only He in (he great battleships, the heavily armored, heavily-gunned vessels which decide the mastery of the seas. Naturalization. In regard to naturalization the pros j blent recommends: hirst. A fedcinl bureau of natural- Izatlon, to ho established tn the do | partment of commerce and labor, to ! supervise the administration of the naturalization laws and to receive ro turns of naturalizations pending and accomplished. Second. Uniformity ot nnturallza Hon certificates, foes to he charged, and procedure. Third. More exacting qunlifica Hons for citizenship Fourth. The preliminary declara tion of intention to he abolished and no alien to ho naturalized until at least ninety days after the filing of hla petition. Fifth. Jurisdiction to naturalize aliens to he confined to United States district courts and to such slate courts as have Jurisdiction In civil actions in which the amount in con troversy la unlimited; In cities of over 100,000 Inhabitants the United Slates district courts to have exclusive jur isdiction in the naturalization of the alien residents of such cities. Land Laws. The honest dsposal and right use of the remaining public lands Is of fun dunicntal Importance. The inlqult ous methods by which Hie monopolit ing of the public lands Is being brought about under Hie present Urws are becoming more generally known, hut the existing laws do not furnish effective remedies. The creation of small Irrigated farms under the re clamatlon act Is a powerful offset to the tendency of crtaln other laws to foster or permit monopoly of the land. Under that act the construction of great Irrigation works has been proceeding rapidly and successfully, the lands reclaimed are eagerly taken up, and the prospect that the policy of national Irrigation will accomplish all that was expi eted of It Is bright The act should be extended to include the slate of Texas. Merchant Marine. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets, and In casf of need to reenforce our battle line. It is not a good thing that American merchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters to South America via Europe If they wish security and dispatch. Immigration. The question of immigration Is of vital Interest to this country. In the year ending June 30, there came to the United States 1,026,000 alien 1m migrants. In other words, In tlx single year that has Just elapsed then come to this country a greater nun: her of people than came here during the 169 years of our colonial life which Intervened between the first landing at Jamestown and the dcclar at lon of independence. While much of thla enorrooua Immigration i* un doubtedly healthy and natural, a con slderahle proportion is undesirable for one reason or another, moreover, a considerable proportion of It, probably a very large proportion, including most of the undesirable class, do* not come here of Us own luiilatlve. but because of the activity of the agents of the great transportation companies. These agents are dls trlbuied throughout Europe. and by the offer of all kinds of Inducements they wheedle and cajole many immi grants, often against their best In terest. to come here. Perhaps It would be possible to limit the number of Im migrants allowed to come In any one year to New York and other northern cities, while leaving unlimited the number allowed to come to the south: always provided, however, that a stricter effort Is made to see mat only Immigrants iff tho right kind come to our country anywhere. As much as possible should bo done to distribute the Immigrants upon the land and keep them away from tho great cities. The prime need Is to keep out all Immigrants who will not make good American etli zens. Adequate means should he adopted, enforced by sufficient penal ties, to compel steamship companies engaged tn the passenger business to observe In good faith tho law which forbids them to encourage or solicit immigration to tho United States. It Is unwise to depart from the old American tradition and to dis criminate for or against any man who desires to come hero and become a citizen, save on the ground of that man’s fitness for citizenship. it Is onr right and duly to consider hts moral and social quality. Ills standard of living should ho such that ho will not, by pressure or com petition, lower the standard of liv ing of our own wageworkers; for tt must ever be a prime object of onr legislation to keep high (heir stand ard of living. If the man who seeks to come here Is from the moral and social standpoint of such a ennrne terns to bid fair to add value to t..e community he should be heartily wet corned. AVe can not afford to pay heed to whether ho Is of one creed or another, of one nation or anbther. \A r o can not afford to consider whether ho Is Catholic or I‘rotestnnt. .lew or Hen tile; whether he Is Englishman or Irishman, Frenchman or Herman, Japanese, Italian, Scandinavian. Slav, or Magyar. What we should desire to And out Is tho Individual quality of the Individual man, in the presi dent’s judgment with this end in view, wo shall havo lo prepare through onr own agents a far more rigid In spection In the countries from which the Immigrants come. The questions arising In connection with Chinese immigration stand by themselves. The conditions in China arc such that the entire Chinese coolie class, that is, the class of Chinese laborers, skilled and unskilled, legit 1 matoly come under the head of unde alrahlo Immigrants to Hils country, he cause of their num’oers, the low wages for which they work, and their low standard of living. Not only In It to Iho Interest of this country to keep them out, hut Hie Chinese authori ties do not desire that they should ho admitted. In the effort, to carry out the policy of excluding Chinese la borers, Chinese coolies, grave injust ice and wrong have been done by this nation to the people of China, and therefore ultimately In Ibis mm Mon ll self, Chinese students, business and professional men of all kinds not only merchants, but hankers, doctors, manufacturers, professors, travelers, and the like should bo encouraged to come hero and treated on precisely tho same footing Hint we treat sin dents, business men, travelers, and the like of other nations. Our laws and treaties should lc framed, not sn is to put these people In the excepted elasses, but to state chat we will admit all Chinese, except Chinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or un skilled laborers. Aa a people wo have talked much of the open door In China, and wo expect, and quite rightly Intend to In slat upon. Justice being shown us by the Chinese. But we can not expert to receive eqylty unless we do equity. We enn not ask the Chinese to do to ns what we are unwilling In do to ihem. They would have a perfect right to exclude our laboring men 1C our laboring men threatened to come Into their country In such numbers -is lo Jeopardize the well-being or 'he Chinese population; and as, mntalls mutandis, the-e were the conditions with which Chim-se Immigration act ually brought this people fare lo face, we had and havo a perfect right, which the Chinese government In no way contests, to net ns we have acted In the matter of resulting eo*lle Im migration. Adulteration of Pood*. Tho civil service law is praised, ihen the president says: "I recom mend that a law bo enacted to regu late Interstate commerce In misbrand <*d and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs. Much law would protect legit (mate manufacture and commerce, and would lend to secure the health and welfare of the consuming public. Traffic In foodstuffs which havo been debased or adulterated so ns to ln •ure health or to deceive purchasers should he forbidden.” The Philippine*. During the last year the Philippine Islands have been slowly recovering 'rom the serlf-s of disasters which, since American occupation, have •really reduced the amount of agrl ultural products below what was produced In Spanish times. The wai, he rinderpest, the locusts, the drought, and the cholera have been united aa causes to prevent a return of the prosperity much needed in the Islands. Tranquility Una existed dur ing the past year throughout the arch ipelago, except In the province of Cavite, the province of Batangas, and the province of Samar, and In the Is land of dole among the Moros. A year from next April the (list legislative assembly for the Islands will be held. On the sanity and self restraint of this body much will depend so far aa the future self-government of the tsiands Is concerned. The most encouraging feature of the situation has been the great Interest taken by the common people In edueac tion and the great tnereaae in the number of enrolled students In the public schools The Increase wae from 800.000 to half a million pupils. The average attendance Is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number of pupils seems to ho the capacity of the government to furnish teachers and sehoolhonses. The agricultural conditions of the Islands enforce more strongly than ever the argument in favor of reduc ing the tariff on the products of the Philippine islands entering the Pulled States. The president earnest ly recommends that the tariff now Im posed by the Plngley hilt upon the products of the Islands be entirely re moved, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be re duced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the Plngtey net; that after July 1. liiol>, the tariff upon tl baeeo and sugar promiceo tn me Is lands ho entirely removed, and that free trade between the Islands and the Putted Stales in the products of each country then be provided for by law. Hawaii. Immediate steps should he taken for the fortification of Hawaii. This la the most Important point In the Pacific to fortify in order to conserve the Interests of tills country. It would he hard to overstate the im portance of this need. Porto Rico, Advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicit!.* confer American elttgenshlp on all citizens of Porto Rico. There la, In Ida judgment, no exenso for failure to do this. Thw present form of government In Porto Hteo, which provides for the apinilnt men! by the president of the members of the executive council or upper house of the legislature, has proved satisfactory and has inspired confi dence In properly owners and Invest ors. The problems and needs of (ho Island are declared to )>< (mistrial and commercial rather than political, Alaska, The president asks that Alaska bs given an elective delegate and that the government should aid in the const ruction of a railroad from the gulf of Alaska to the Yukon river, tn American territory. The president recommends that Indian territory and Oklahoma he admitted us one slate and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted us one state. The Panama Canal. The treaty between Iho United States and the Republic of Panama under which the construction of (ho Panama canal was made possible, wont Into effect with Us ratification by the l lied SI aI oh senate on Febru ary 28. ill. The canal properties of the French Canal company were transferred to the United Suites on April 28, 100-1, on payment of $40,000,- 000 to that company. On April I, 1005, Hie commission was reorganized Acllvo work In canal construction mainly preparatory, has been In progress for leas than a year and a half. The point which remains un settled Is the question of type, whether tho canal shall bo one of several locks above the sea level, or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point the president hopes to lay be fore congress at an early day the I findings of (he advisory board of Amcilean engineers. The American people Is pledged to tho speediest pos | slide construction of a canal adequate 1 to meet the demands which tho com merce of tho world will make upon It, I and ho appeals most earnestly to tho ! congress to aid In the fulfillment of the pledge. (Jratlfylng progress has been made during the past year and especially during tho past four months. Tho greater part of the necessary preliminary work has be ) done. Actual work of excavation could be begun only on a limited scale till the canal zone was made a health ful place to live In and to work In. What Is needed now and without de lay Is an appropriation by congress to meet the current expenses of the commission. Tho first appropriation of $10,000,000, out Of tho $135,000,000 authorized by the Spooner act, was made three years ago. There Is bare ly enough of It remaining to carry tho commission to the end of the year. Unless congress shall appropriate be fore that time all work must cease. To arrest progress for any length of time now when matters are advanc ing so satisfactorily, would be de plorable, declares the president. 1/jrd Templemore, "the father of the house of lords,” sat In that body for twenty eight years before he de livered his maiden speech, and bis effort consisted of twenty-one words.
