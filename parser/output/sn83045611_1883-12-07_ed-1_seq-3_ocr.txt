Ixith I'arolinas, Mississippi, I Colorado, Indiana, and other delegates j are expected to arrive tonight The 1 President of theCongiess, Major 'I. H. | Hudson, of i.ainar. Miss., opened the I congress with an address of softie 1 ngth etting forth the demands and wants of ' agriculturists, especially the appoint ment of a commissioner of agriculture as a ruemtier of the President's cabinet. Such an officer, hesai I, could watoh our foreign relations in respect to this inter est, which must ever lie greatest: and he would be enabled to secure to farmers" latxirs a Imtter result. There is not a farmer in all this country who under stands farming as he should, and how ignorant must be the Cabinet and na tional oouuclls who have never stuiied it. Ihe prosperity of the country de pends on the progress of agriculture. Such being the stttei'f affairs, a'l de liberations of national b>dies should tend towards us salvation. I uis can not l»e secured until f irmers are brought into a body. I<et il* therefore teach tho farmers the r own interest and raise a crv that will reach the Federal Govern melit at Washington. We are in sad need wf scientific knowledge of farming. Such means should be sweured as would put this knowledge int*> easy possession of the tillers of the soil, lie said that there should be arranged t statement showing the cause of the prosperity of various products in various quarters: thus the farmer would know what land was best adipted to the piod ictiou of such crops as he desired. He wocld his owu povert as compared with the wealth of bis neighbor. One Stite would watch another, and the best interests would be en Lanced by the nv dry incited by th> se reports, which would be made monthly. The good re sults of such a system regarding cotton showed the gre.tt advantage of such a proceeding. At the conclusion of the president's address, and when commit tees had been appointed for the virions duties, the congress adjourned. It will probably be in session three days. - -«*»

PABIS, Dec. s. —Marquis Tseng com ments on the statement m ide berry in the Chnnibfr of Deputies uu the .list of October, that the French Government did not believe China would declare w tr, nor had France any intention of doing so; that France was desirous of tiruily est iblUhing herself in the lt -d river delta by y wuing pos ses-ion of Sontay and H icmnh, .ndthat when that was achieved nobody would be nble to drive her out: that, with patience, sangfroid and her fi»roes, she would be proof against everything, and that a prudent policy would lead to ttie settlement of the i'onquiu affair. I'he M irqilirt observes thai this statement produced a painful impression m l'on qtiin. If it became a question of pos session of I'onquiu, furtUer negotiu tlou would be unless, as it will be im possible for China to agree thereto. <hi November :suth Ferry declared that tlie French Government had not changed in the last three years the policy guided by tUe principles which formed the basis of the treaty of 1H74. The Gov ernment desired a consolidation of the French protector»te, tree navigation of the Song Koi river aud security for iu commercial relations in 'i'ouqum. M irquis Tsenj{ having received a pro |KHal to fix the liue of deui >rc ttiun be tween the armies and the Canton en oaiupments at Hanoi and at Sontay and on the bank of the lied river. Ferry pointed out that Marquis Tseng de clared ou the Ist of August that there were 110 Chinese troops 111 Touquiu : wheruupon ChalUm.l Leooar, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, re plied that there was consequently 110 danger of a conflict. If the Chinese forces occupied tUe fortress against which the trench were advancing they would run the risk of being considered Annamite auxiliaries. Since then the situatiou has remained unchanged by otir own act, and our plan of coiipaigu has not been mod 1 tied and c tnnot l»e modified, und the responsibility for a conflict will not rest witti 11s.

Lird Lorue concluded by HftyuiK that the Canadian iieople are thoroughly devoted to their connection with the mother country, otherwise they w uld long ago have discarded their alle.ii mee, of which they are proud.
