FOOD FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN. One of the little appreciated ditficultiesconnected with the high cost of food is the fact that although foodstuffs now cost "0 per cent more than they did a year aero, double what they did a few years past, the allowances made by states or cities to the homes where dependent children are lodged in most cases have not in creased. Whether the homes are under public or private supervision, as a rule no arrangement has been made to make the food budget correspond with the rise in prices. The result of this unseeing policy is that the quality and variety of food given to dependent children have suffered. If there is any (lass of citizens whose food supply ought to lie carefully and generously looked after it is that of the little folks whhave lost their natural pro viders. As soon as they are old enough to get working papers, they must face the world without the back ground of loing relatives to help them in a pinch. Fven more than the children of loving parents do they need all the help they can get to prow physically stron and well. Malnutrition of little ones by the state is nothing short of criminal. It is to be hoped that all that is needed is to hae the attention of those in charge called to the discrepancy between stationary allowances and shifting pfis to have the trouble remedied. allies eonie W af. THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM. Pres't Wilson's message to congress yesterday was such a marvel tor brevity as seldom marks state papers, having details to the reports and recommendations of the various departments, and causing those reports and recommendations to appear to have been matters of cabinet immoderation, and perhaps to have had admin istration approval. Aside from this, the president's chief cniKcrn, as he has l.tid it before the law making body, points to the completion of the eight-hour law prog! am. the enlargement of the interstate commerce . ommk-sion, advance investigation to precede railroad strikes, power to the president to operate railroads undtr c.-rtaan conditions, and the granting of greater "ret dent to husine engage m the promotion of J a v..ti BY AIR TO THE 

POLE. There is nothing remarkable about Capt. Uaoul Amundsen's project of reaching the north pole by air plane. The only remarkable thing is that no explorer ! has vet tried this method in either the Arctic or Ant- ii rctic. When Feary (or Cook, or both of them) tramped to the big nail, the airplane was but a doubtful experiment Fven when Amundsen won the south pole by the same primitive method, it was far from its present develop ment. Now there is no question of its utility for such a purpose. The machine must be strongly built to stand the buffets of polar storms, the metal strains of low temperatures, and the shocks of landing on rough ice packs. There must be a plentiful supply of fuel. But there seems to be no serious obstacle to success, either mechanical or human. Air Ilight to the south pole would no doubt be very ditTicult, because of the high mountain ranges to be crossed and the terrific gales that southern explorers have always had to face. Hut from all accounts, the north polar region is com paratively calm, and as level as the sea of which it forms a part. Amundsen is no bluffer and no dreamer. When he sjvs that lie intends to fly to the pole, he will probably keep bis word. He plans to take his airplane on a ship, and use it for general exploring purposes, with the ship as a base. Thus he can cover as much ground in an hour as the ordinary sledge party could cover in And then his mother, I recall. Wished she could keep him always two.

Rarely do they show any unusual clarity of mental visions in other directions than that of their specialty. Hut mental prod igies are far more numerous than we are accustomed to think.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING. (Asheville. N. C. Citizen.) Work is . not man's curse but his greatest hlessin. and to many it is life's supreme blessing. Without v.ork no man may be happy and he whose work is congenial is twice 1 lessed. The tendency of modern ucation is to discover in the child its natural inclination of mind that its full and quick development may follow the world's eificiency and its sum total of human happiness. It is no new complaint that ma ri val training in the school has been neglected for the study of lan guages, and that schools often lit their ltuiols for the universities but not lor the world. This complaint will not always obtain, however, for times are changing anil with them educational methods change, too. In Asheville is disc overed an increased interest in vocational stud'es, and in the already famous Gary schools the child's vocational Instincts are early discovered and developed. Thus are educators beginning to recognize the value of time, and of the distinction between education and instruction. Graduates of the Gary school will enter life's strife armed according to their peculiar needs. Some will go forth equipped to lircomc hrst-class carpenters, r brick-layers, or machinists. er en gineers. thers will leave the school with the essential foundation upon which to build ti'.eir future careers as writers, physicians, business men or artists. The Gary schools have al andoned the world-old idea of try ing to lit a square peg into a round hole. Its graduates will have saved priceless years and their steps will , have been guided along that path ' which their natural inclinations and personal characteristics make them best fitted to follow. In this way through the medium of congenial work the world's happi ness will be vastly increased no less than its efliciency. Instead of spend ing fruitless years groping through the mists of chance? for that open ing which shall reveal the path to congenial work and greater happi ness the chiid itself, in the Gary .schools, indicates th.it path and dur ing. Its school year? it is led easily und naturally to the foot of that mountain it must clmb without fur ther aid, but which it ha.s been pre pared to climb, and at whose sum mit it tinds success and happiness. For to become a competent engineer, or machinist or brick-layer, is no less a life success than to become a; world-famous artist, or surgeon, or) author. The world needs all. holds i its rewards for all, and all find their greatest happiness in congenial work not man's curse but his greatest blessing. oils Are Lxoensive This Year We have a large,, jointed, full bodied Doll beautifully dressed, that we are goin to give to some girl on De cember 23rd. j To the girl that collects the most advertisements about C.
