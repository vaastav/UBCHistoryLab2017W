THE INDIANAPOLIS JOURNAL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1895. THE DAILY JOUltNAL WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4. ISO 5. Those vrho thought that the President might so outside of New York for a Supreme judge gave him credit for too much breadth of view. lie did not even CO outside of the Peckham family. It Is complimentary to the legal profes-' ilon that It contains many lawyers fit to be Supreme Judges who are scarcely heard of outside of their respective States until they are nominated for the position. "Our foreign relations" cause Mr. Cleveland a good deal of, concern. This Is not surprising In view of the fact that under his administration all our foreign relations have assumed the bullying bis brother role. The practice of Congress in ordering a, few thousand copies of the President's message printed Is a perfunctory piece of legislative courtesy. Millions of cop ies of the message are printed In the dally papers before the few thousands ordered by Congress are printed. The alleged newly-discovered evidence In the Illnshaw case will probably prove to be no evidence at all. and per haps a fraudulent attempt to manu facture some. It Is incredible that "a warm friend of Mr. Illnshaw," as Asher Is said to be, should not only have failed to come forward at the trial with im portant evidence for the' defense, but should have refused to talk after Hin shaw's conviction, when a new trial might have been obtained If Asher's itory is true. The statement that Asher kept still through fear of his life is, in common parlance, "too thin." The whole etory has a flavor of country-side gossip. f Illnshaw is not guilty the Journal would rejoice to see him vindicated, but the deliberate verdict of twelve honest and intelligent men is not to be set aside on the strength of old women's talk. Dispatches from different quarters con cur In stating that the British minister at Constantinople has notified the Sultan that if an official permit is not granted by next Saturday for a British war ves sel to pass through" the Dardanelles, one will come, through without permission. This is In the nature of an ultimatum, and mean's that, with or without the action of other powers. Great Britain is determined, to adopt measures for the protection of British subjects and prop erty. The passage of a war ship through the Dardanelles would not nec essarily Imply hostilities. Indeed, the mis sion of the vessel would be peaceable, as It would go simply as a guard ship. But if Its passage, after being once de termined upon, should be resisted, or if the vesjel should be fired upon, hostlll . ties would almost certainly ensue. This latest step adds materially to the criti cal condition of the situation. Mr. Cleveland is quite right in recom mending that United States representa tives abroad should be provided with official residences.1 Republican simplicity Is all very well within proper limits, but when Its practice makes it difficult for the representatives to secure proper recognition for themselves and their country the case is altered. It is not i ! - r-- iA:r wr liihl inir t 1 1 1 iit ns1iiih Mini tyi in f t ct aVirtulA Vt oet r c n ftL In Via most costly and luxurious quarters, but they should at least be surrounded with sufficient official' elegance to Insure re spectful treatment of them by people tho are accustomed to Judge of a coun- A A - . . t iry s importance Dy tne manner in wnicn It serves its representatives. When the republic was young and poor, simplicity was Jn order.

BETTER FinB PROTECTION. Another Are, with an aggregate loss of at lea'st'half a million dollars, empha sises anew the inadequacy of the Indi anapolis . fire service. It is not the part of the Journal at this time to point out where; theV fault lies whether with the management; the apparatus or the water company.' Critics of each and all of these departments are numerous, but in the excitement Incident to such a conflagra tion spectators. Interested or disinterest ed, are not qualified to fix the hlame un erringly. That must be done by careful investigation and by. competent Judges. Few who watched the progress and man tsemenfof the fire on Washington street in September and that oi yesterday on Couth -Meridian street but will agree that grave defects in the service do exist. The Eastman. Schleicher & Lee building iras five stories, in height, the bank building adjoining four stories,, but no water could be thrown upon either ex cept from hose carried to fthp roofs of adjoining blocks, and the streams then lacked force and volume. The building In whlqh the fire of yesterday originated was less than four full stories and should have been drenched with water at once, bet with the strength of the entire de partment concentrated on it the flames were allowed to spread until buildings covering an acre of ground were destroyed.- At .-no. time during the day, according to the testimony of witnesses, were streams of water thrown above the third-story windows. The individual fire men worked hard and faithfully, but with Inadequate results. Something 1: radically wrong with the department It is the duty of the city authorities U find the defect without delay and to ap ply a remedy. The commercial interests of the city demand it. Business men must not be called upon to pay the cost of municipal negligence in increased in surance risks. Owners of blocks have a right to protection for their property, both for its own sake and for the sense of security afforded their tenants. Under present conditions neither proprietors nor occupants can feel secure, and the result will inevitably be to retard im portant down-town Improvements. Citi zens feel, rightfully enough, that their taxes are sufficiently high to Justify them In demanding the very best fir service possible,' and the disaster of yes terday, following so close upon that of September, will cause them to insist upon their rights. Investigation should be prompt and thorough. If the management was at fault, let no favoritism shield Ineffi ciency; If new apparatus is needed, pur chase the best; if tho water works are N in;iual to requirements, brlas the com pany to time. This duty is the most urgent and important now before the Mayor, the Board of Public Safety and the City Council. TUG 

PIICSIDEXT'S MESSAGE. Recent events have given so much prominence to International questions and national finances that the President owed no apology for devoting his entire message to these two toplc3. Probably no presidential message has ever dis cussed either topic as fully as this one does. Much of the discussion Is surplus age, and the message might have been greatly abbreviated without sacrificing anything of Importance. Mr. Cleveland's style is so heavy and his sentences so long that he consumes a great deal of space in saying comparatively little. Ills presentation of the riots and mas sacres in China adds nothing to facjs published In the newspapers many weeks ago. His statement of the Waller case, reduced to plain terms, shows that 'the French government has been playing a game of "bluff" against the . United States for months and still refuses to Submit a copy of the evidence on which Waller was convicted. Meanwhile he is in Jail, though the President says, in his polysyllabic way, that "his confine ment has every alleviation which the state of his health and all the other clr cumstances of the case demand or per mit." This is poor consolation for an American citizen confined In a foreign prison. ' ' The discussion of our trade relations with Germany and the exclusion of American meats is simply an exploita tion of the President's free-trade ideas, without any recommendation calculated to improve matters. The only recom mendation regarding the Bering sea question Is that Congress pay the lump sum of $425,000 In settlement of British claims, which it has already refused to pay. Of course, Congress will disregard this recommendation and insist upon an arbitration of the points in controversy. The two most interesting features In this part of the message are the, Ven ezuelan boundary dispute and the Cuban question. As to the first, the President's statement is clear and satisfactory. It shows that, in a" communication to the British government the administration has distinctly reaffirmed the Monroe doc trine, declared its opposition to any at tempt on the part of Great Britain to appropriate Venezuelan territory and In sisted that all the points in dispute shall be submitted to arbitration. As far as can be gathered from the President's statement, the position taken by the ad ministration qn this subject is firm, de cided and satisfactory. The treatment of the Cuban question will fall far short of meeting the approv al of those who belleVe that this govern ment should extend some recognition or encouragement to the insurgents. The President speaks of them as "struggling for larger autonomy and greater free dom," as If they had a particle of either. His treatment of the subject Is cold blooded, and he sees no obligation except that of enforcing' the neutrality laws. There is nothing American in this part of the message. ' The President's discussion of national finances is like a presentation of "Ham let" with Hamlet left out. He touches on many phases of the situation, but by great effort and with surprising circum locution avoids the vital one of increased revenue. He even makes the astonishing Statement that "in the present stage of our difficulty the amount of our revenue receipts does not directly affect It."- And with amazing stupidity adds:. 'The im portant question is not the quantity of money received in -revenue payments, but the kind of money we maintain." On some phases of the financial question the President Is sound, but In the light of the statements above quoted one is forced to think that his soundness on any phase of the question is purely, acci dental. Having shown his utter inability to deal with the financial situation, It re mains for Congress to adopt its own methods. IWAFrKECIATED 

GREATNESS AND CANCELED DATES. Among the most conspicuous posters that now decorate the bill boards and dead walls in this city is one that strikes the eye by Its flaring yellow color and big, black letters. It does not present the likeness of the latest theatrical star, the classic posing of some ballet girl or the striking features of a negro minstrel, but with all the emphasis that can be crowded into about six feet by eight of space it announces that "David B. Hill, the Noted Orator and Greatest States man of . America," will le:ture In Indi anapolis on the evening of Dec. 5. Whether Mr. Hill superintended the printing of the poster himself, or whether he authorized his agent to state that he was a noted ora tor and the greatest statesman of Amer ica, the public should feel grateful for the Information. If it had not been con veyed in the manner and form aforesaid the public might have remained forever Ignorant that Senator Hill was what the poster says he is. Reading and thinking people who keep in touch with current history and form their opinions for themselves have not regarded Sena tor Hill as either an eloquent oiator ot a great statesman, but the statement of the poster Is so positive that it is calcu lated to make the public think it has been mistaken. The public knows now that the main announcement of the poster Is not true. Senator Hill will not lecture here on the evening of Dec. 5, nor, so far as known, m any other evening. In theatrical par lance the date is canceled. In conveying- this sad information to an expectant public it was announced that the noted orator and great statesman had con tracted a severe cold, which compelled his Immediate retirement from the lect ure neiu ana return to iscw iorK. lie did Indeed encounter a killing frost in Minnesota, but his cold was not of the kind that settles on the lungs or ob structs the speech. It was simply a dis covery on the part of Senator Hill that a large portion of the United States lies west of New York and that he 'is not nearly as noted an orator or great a statesman west of the Alleghenles as he is beneath the shadow of Tammany. The fact that the Tammany standard of greatness did not prevail in the West was made so painfully apparent by the ridiculously small number of persons who attended his lectures that it chilled his blood and froze the genial current of his soul. It was a spiritual freeze, a moral cold that made it Impossible for him to continue his lecture tour. There fore he canceled all his dates and re turned to the bosom of Tammany. The posters still announce him, with glaring emphasis, . as "the Noted Orator and Greatest Statesman of America," but those who read between the lines know they are a big, yellow fake. 

COMMITTALS TO REFORM SCHOOLS. In the city columns of Tuesday's Jour nal mention was made of the bringing into the Circuit Court of a little orphan girl, ten years old, whose temporary custodians asked that she be committed to the Girls' Reformatory. She was a prepossessing child In appearance, and inquiry by the Judge elicited the fact that she was in no way vicious and not even obnoxious to the vague and much abused charge of incorrigibility. The Judge very properly declined to commit the child to the reformatory, and Instead cent her to another institution where she will be cared for until she can be provid ed With a home. . The incident illustrates the erroneous idea which many persons have, and which even some Judges seem to enter tain, in regard to the scope and object of reformatory institutions. Many seem to think that a reform school is a sort of orphans home or charitable institu tion for the reception of children whose parents cannot conveniently take care of them, or who are in somebody's way at home. There is reason to believe that under this loose and erroneous Idea many children of both sexes, and espe cially many girls of tender years, are committed to the reform school who never should be sent there. The managers of these Institutions know that not a few of the com mittals are uncalled-for. If not il legal, but they have no discretion but to receive all who are sent. Many Judges seeni to forget that the reform school Is really a penal institution and that none should be committed to it except criminal, vicious or Incorrigible girls. The best place for any child until it is past the hope of reform is its own home, if it has one. The next best place is In a good home with others than its parents. It should only be committed to a public institution as a last resort, and to a penal institution last of all. Some of the inmates of all reform schools are already vicious, while others only await an opportunity to become so. It is a shame and outrage to force inno cent little girls into such company and place upon them- a stigma which they have done nothing to deserve, and which may handicap them all their lives. For, admitting all that is claimed for reform schools in the way of beneficial results, the fact remains that committal to such an institution carries with it a stigma which is hard to get rid of, and a contin uing humiliation. For these and other obvious reasons Judges should exercise great care in making committals to such institutions that they be made only for strictly legal grounds and on clear evidence. The report of Coroner Castor published on Tuesday shows that of twenty-six rail way accidents in Marion county last year twenty of the people were killed on the tracks and six on the trains. A report for the State of Pennsylvania shows that out or a total of. 1,53$ persons killed by the rail ways during the year nearly three-fourth; came to. their death while walking on the tracks. These figures seem to Indicate that the perils of travel surround the pedestrian rather than the man who travels in the cars and is commonly supposed to be there by taking his life In his hands. Senator Hill wrote to the Waubansee Club, of Chicago, canceling his lecture en gagement, but expressing the hope that at some future date, when the weather was not so cold, he might visit their city and meet them all. Come to think of It, the at mosphere must be rather chilly around where David 13; but when does'he expect it to moderate? All the world admires pluck.

If One Ii Not Granted Then, It Is Re ported Nbat -England 'Will Force , t . t' the Passage tef the Dardanelles. DIPLOMATS REFUSE TO TALK niT IT IS RELIEVED THERE IS A BASIS FOR THE REPORT. Great Activity In Italian Naval Circles and Among: the Turk Stationed Along the Bosphorus. ' LONDON, Dec. 4. Dispatches from Con stantinople by way of Sofia, Rome and Ber lin, indicate that the real ..crisis in the Turko-Armenlan question is approaching. Advices from Berlin report that a dispatch has been received by the Frankfor: Zeltung from Constantinople, which says that Sir Philip Currle, the British embassador, yes terday had an interview with Tewflk Pasha, tho Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, during which the former notlaed the latter that Great Britain allowed Turkey until Saturday next In which to .grant the per mission for an additional guard ship to pass the Dardanelles for the protection of the British embassy at Constantinople. In tho event of a refusal, the Frankfort Zei tung's dispatch adds. Sir Philip Informed Tewflk Pasha that a British gunboat would be sent through tho Dardanelles without the permission asked for. It is further stated that Italy . Indorses the action of Great Britain In this matter. Inquiries made in official circles here In London failed to elicit a confirmation of the report. Neither could the report be confirmed in official circles at Rome. The news received there was similar to the dis patch printed by the Frankfort Zeitung. The dispatch from' Constantinople via So fia also said that Sir Philip had given the Sultan until Saturday to make up his mind about the firman, but that there was no official confirmation or denial of the rumor. The Vienna correspondent of the Dally News indicates there may be some basis for the story. He says that a telegram re ceived by the Turkish embassy , in Vienna last night (Tuesday) states that the Sultan has resolved to break all diplomatic rela tions If the powers force the Dardanelles. A dispatch from Rome to the Dally News says that there? is great activity in all the Italian arsenals to prepare the whole' naval force of the , country . The cruiser Pied- monte, the newest and fastest in the Ital ian service, her speed being twenty-one knots an. hour, has been ordered to the Le vant. The Porte Is not Idle, either, for a dispatch from Constantinople says the work of strengthening- the fortifications of the DardaneUes continues' night and day. The soldiers are busily at work throwing up fresh defenses and the most busy scenes are witnessed from the entrance of the Dardanelles to the other 'side of GalllpolL In addition, the Bosphorus entrance of the Sea of Marmora'ls being placed In condition for defense. Many torpedoes have been sunk in both passages,' and this work Is being pushed with a8ton.lsh.lng vigor. Tvie Dally News correspondent at Con stantinople says: "A letter from a Euro pean at Marsovan says that on Saturday after, the massacre , there waa, a.-ghastly a-yeciacie ai me eage or tne .Armenian cem etery. Corpses were brought by the wagon load and tossed on the . ground In heaps. Aside from the rifling of' the bodies by the perpetrators of the slaughter, a hyena-like horde of barbarians pounced, on these heaps and stripped the dishonored carcasses of what poor clothing they had, leaving them In all degrees of nudity. Finally, about noon, a score of Armenians, headed by a priest, were sent under protection of sol diers to bury tho corpses... Eighty-three of them were laid In a single trench. Probably about a hundred people were k'Hled." Cnnnot Stay In Turkey. NEW YORK, Dec 4.-The World, this morning, says: The persistent efforts of Proprietor Louis Klopsch. of the Christian Herald, to send relief to. starving Armeni ans through Mr. W. W. Howard, the(news paper correspondent, have been suddenly checked. The Turkish minister at Wash ington said very plainly that Mr. Howard was objectionable to the Sultan's govern ment. The reasons assigned wei-e Mr. How ard's dispatches describing the atrocities In Armenia. Considerable correspondence has been exchanged since on the mat ter of Mr. Howard's proposed, mis sion. Yesterday Mr. Klopsch received a letter from the Department of State at Washington, under date of Dec. 2, In which It was said: "I have -to inform you that our minister at Constantinople has been advised by the Turkish govern ment that Mr. W. W. Howard will not be permitted to proceed to Asiatic Turkey. The reasons given for this decision are Mr. Howard's alleged hostility to the Turkish government, and his attacks on It and the Mahommedan religion In newspapers of the United States." .. .. Mr. Klopsch regards this decision as final, and he has cabled Mr." Howard to return to this country. '" Work of Armlnjr Reserve Stopped. CONSTANTINOPLE, ( Dec. 2.. via Sofia. Bulgaria, Dec. 3. The work of arming and equipping the Turkish reserves has been al most suspended, although the troops are still kept at their mustering places. The Turkish authorities say that this is be cause there will be no use for their ser vices, as order Is being gradually restored la all the troubled districts. On the other hand, the Armenians claim that the govern ment cannot equip the reserves owing to lack of money. Letters have been received here from Har poot telling of the recent massacre there and the burning of the American mission buildings, but although they give fuller de tails, the facts in the main were all cabled a week or ten days ago. : So far as can be judged with th absence of definite news the most serious disturbances threatened or In progress is in Palestine, fresh out breaks being reported at Cesarea and at Konieh, and In the Mecca districts.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Mr. Hagop Bogiglan, the secretary of the meeting re cently held In Fancuil Hall, Boston, in the Interest of the Armenians, called on Secre tary Olney with a view to learning If the American funds collected for the relief of the sufferers could be distributed through the instrumentality of Minister Terrell. Th Secretary suggested the Red Cross So ciety as an agency best adapted to the work of distribution. Mr. Bcgtgian later called on iiiss Barton, the presiaent, and some or tne staff officers cf the society, regarding the matter. While the answers to his questions were rather noncommittal the impression he received was that If there was a popular demand or request that the Red Cross un dertake the work it would do sc.

The Reichstag was opened at noon to-day. The speech from the throne was read by Prince Hohenlohe, the Chancellor. After referring to the an niversaries of tho glorious victories of 1S70-71 and urging the Reichstag In con- Junction with the federal government to continue to build up the united empire, the foundations of which were laid twenty five years ago, the speech says: "The friendlv relations of the emnlra with foreign powers continue unchanged. In conjunction with Russia and France, Ger many has endeavored to crevent further complications which were threatened by me war Detwecn the two great east Asiatic empires. Our endeavors have been at tended with success thanks to the Judicious moderation displayed by the Japanese gov ernment, and will contribute to preserving and enlarging the field of peaceful labor for uermanys industry and trade.

After the Imperial Chancellor had de clared the Reichstag opened, the president of the Reichstag, Baron Von Buolo-Beren-berg, called for three cheers for the Em peror. In the budget, which was after wards submitted to the Reichstag, the revenues and expenditures balanced at 1.253,221,583 marks, against 1,239,250,441 last year. Von Koeller DismUaed. 

BERLIN, Dec 3. The report that Baron Von Koeller, the Prussian Minister of the Interior, has been dismissed on. account of the recent strong measures he had Insti tuted against the Socialists, ordering the closing of their clubs and the searching of their residences, is confirmed. Previous to his departure for Breslau, the Emperor caused Herr Von Lucanus; chief of the Civil Cabinet of his Ma1stv. to make a special report In the case of Professor Ddiorueck, who was to have been prose cuted for a very mild statement In the Con servative Preusslsche Jahrbucher. referring to the internal politics of the empire and criticising Baron Von Keller for his whole sale prosecution of Socialists. His Majesty afterwards conferred with Prince" Hohen lohe; the Chancellor, and the latter Is said to have informed tho Emperor that he would be compelled to tender his resigna tion unless Von Koeller was dismissed. Dr. Von Schoenstedt. the Prussian Minister of Justice, also offered to resign, but was not permitted to do so. i Sallnbury' Reply to Olney.

Result of the Municipal Elections ThrouKhont the Hay State. BOSTON, Dec. 3. New city governments were chosen in nineteen of the thirty-one cities of the Commonwealth to-day, and In three-quarters of them there was practically no enthusiasm whatever. In many places party lines were not drawn, and in Spring field, Somervllle, Gloucester, Brockton and other cities the battle was fought on the A. P. A. issue." The contest In Springfield was one of the warmest In the history of that city, and resulted In the overthrow ot candidates Indorsed by the A. P. A.

Members expressed surprise that no recommendation was made for the supply of the treasury deficit. In the discussion of forelgm affairs the portion devoted to the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine In con. nectlon with the boundary line dispute and the suggestions regarding Cuba attracted special attention, but the main Interest centered in the recommendations for the retirement of the greenbacks and tho ex tension of the national banking system. Several of the Democratic leaders who dif fer with the President on tho financial question refused to express their opinions for publication. The Republicans of the Senate do not ap prove the message so far as It concerns finances. It matters not whether they be silver men or not, they all have something o say against it. Many Senators expressed the opinion that the messagro was disap pointing because it did not provide a method for raising revenue. All f the Re publicans who are known as sound money men were especially disappointed on ac count of this feature of tho message. The silver men were, of course, very emphatic In their disapproval of the President's views on silver. For the most part, how ever, the Republicans spoke in terms of approval of the position of the President regarding foreign affairs, but moro espe cially as to what he cald about Venezuela. The silver Democrats had very little to say regarding the message, and It was for the most part a disappointment for them. There was a general impression in the Sen ate that the proposition of the President to retire the greenbacks would not bo suc cessful. A special to the Journal says: Senator Voorhees announced this afternoon that he did not share the views of President Cleve land on the financial question and that he for one would work against any bill to retire the legal tenders. For once Mr. Voorhees appears to have landed on the winning side, as it is the overwhelming opinion that no legislation for the retire ment of the legal tenders can be en acted. Comments of tbe London Press. 

LONDON, Dec 4- The newspapers this morning very generally contain editorial comments on President Cleveland's message to Congress. The Graphic says: 'The crudities and Indiscretions of President Cleveland's present pronouncements on for eign affairs might have been evolved by the late Mr. Blaine in his worst mood. Can anything be more absurd than the proposal that the Schomburg line (in Venezuela) should be submitted to arbitration? The reference to Cuba is lmlnltely more injudi cious. It is virtually an expression of sym pathy for filibustering." The Standard, the Conservative -organ, says: "We cannot but . regret the tone of President Cleveland's references to Ven ezuela. If we may Judge of the tone and substance of Mr. Olney' dispatch from the paraphrase thus ' imparted to Congress we-are not surprised that' no answer has been received and we further undertake to predict that when the reply reaches the White House it will furnish the Pres ident with a deal of matter for serious reflection. We must be pardoned If we venture to say that the whole passage re ferlng to Venezuela is a tissue of un real assumptions and unsupported deduc tions. If the Americans desire to carry out the views thus expressed they will do so after due calculation of the cost. Even if we are eager for arbitration the ex perience in the Bering sea controversy would hardly encourage us. It is not easy to argue calmly when we find that Pres ident Cleveland has already prejuded the merits of the dispute. But even strong states have rights and though Great Brit ain is able to maintain its dignity and in terests It ought not to be a mark for pub lic affront in a presidential message. We are not much impressed with his currency proposals. He suggests a palliative and not a cure." The Post (Conservative) says: "As re gards Samoa and Venezuela the message anDears to be framed on lines which Sen ator Chandler might approve. In regard to Cuba there are similar signs of a disposi tion to conciliate the feelings of popular agitators. These things are Incidents of every presidential campaign and President Cleveland never pretended to be superior to them." , lM The Times editorial says: "President Cleveland has drawn a startling picture of tho difficulties created by the vicious cur rency system, and we shall be greatly sur prised if the plans he suggests are not warmly welcomed by business men through out the States But. flushed by electoral victories, it is probable enough that the Re publicans will refuse to allow anything to be done In the direction indicated. Mean while, the remainder of the message, es pecially the references to foreign relations, will give tho fmpresslon that he Is marking time. Nothing, ho says, commits him to a new or aggressive foreign policy, while it will task the Ingenuity of his opponents to make out that he has in any way com promised the dignity or been careless of tho Interests of his country." The Dally News, the Liberal organ, says: "President Cleveland knows better than to trfat tho Monroe doctrine as if It were a rule cf international law. It Is neither dig nified nor politic for the administration to take up the quarrels of South American communities which do not observe the usages of civilized nations. America will find some day that this sort of patronage Involves a corresponding responsibility, and thev will not like that at all." An editorial In the Chronicle says "It Is very doubtful If Congress will accept Presi dent Cleveland's currency plan. The mes sage sounds cautious, but there is a wel come note in the direction of free trade. The reference to Armenia must be regarded as the definite adherence of the United States to the European concert. Few hon est critics can cay anything against Presi dent Cleveland's reference to Venezuela, We agree with him that the boundary dis pute is eminently suited to arbitration, and. undoubtedly, our government will take the same view. It must be remembered that this question Is quite distinct from that of the reparation due us by Venezuela for Injuries. When such reparation Is made, every Liberal In this country will acquiesce In President Cleveland's doctrine. Our. hands are full enough without increasing our bur dens In America, but especially at the risk of creating a serious strain between our selves and the one great power whose friendship Is more valuable to us than that of all the others put together.". The Chroni cle concludes its editorial by asking wheth er America is ready to undertake the re spons'billty thus incurred for the faithful discharge of their obligations by the Ameri can republics.
