Editor of Tbe Lexington Gazxttk: In the fall of 1860, the writer of this, then a child ' of about 7 years, in company with his little sister, mother ind other friends, wended their steps toward what was then called, if I remember correctly, tbe "Point," or landing (or the packet boats plying thea between Rich? mond, Lynchburg and the up-coun? try points?Lexington, Buchanan, etc, 1 was going unwillingly, for besides leaving theocly home lever knew up to tbut time, I left behind me a little play-mate of a dog, and I recalled for years afterwards the scene of the little animal standing on tbe wharf crying after us as tbe boat was pushed out into the stream. I mention this little personal inci? dent merely to show tbat 1 was once an inhabitant of your prettly little town, and, like so many others, perhaps, "roamed." I am glad to say, however that I availed myself ol an opportunity to revisit tbe scenes of my earliest childhood recently, on Thanksgiv? ing Day. But 1 felt very much like Kip Van Winkle! Poor Rip! How I sympathized with him, more than ever. Tbe poet bas said tbat a "fel? low-feeling makes us wondrous kind." True, I did not notice tbat my clothes were of a century-old pattern, nor did any ot your good people refuse to handle my coin be? cause of a wrong profile being on it: yet. when I commenced to look aim .. for some one I might know, or wbo might know me, I found tbat I was as much of a stranger in my old home as was poor old Rip. But fifty? one years is quite a sufficient length of time for any one to be forgotten in. I am sure. It was not a case of forgetting, however, but something else, to which I will refer later on. Ot course, among tbe first things one thinks of on returniug to the scenes of bis childhood is the old home, or what was called home, j Although Lexington has, of course, changed much in 51 years, yet I easily found tbe building in wbicb < we lived. And what a flood of memories came rushing back to me! There was the door in which little sister and I used to sit, supremely content with each other; there was the self-same street (then a road), in . which we wouldchase the lightning- j bugs on moonlit nights; there was ; tbe same window out_of which wei would watch the pattering rain as ii would splash up from puddles in j the street, forming, as we would childishly say to each other, "cups and saucers," and there was the' same back-yard in which your cor-; respondent would stand and look up at the assembled worshipers next door, proudly displaying his dumb watch and chain which bad come in the box from father. While I stood near the spot and my mind was dwelling in and run? ning over the scenes and faces of "away back yonder," 1 felt impelled to accost a passer-by with tbe re? mark, "My friend, pardon me, but do you know of any one wbo has been in this neighborhood for fifty odd years?" He thought awhile, and then slowly shook his head, but added that be himself had been a resident for fifty-two yet rs. Hard? ly enough to know me, I mused to myself. However, I thought I would inquire the gentleman's name. He proved to be a younger brother of one of the little boys I knew then. That was as near as I could come in finding anyone, though I made diligent inquiry. Name after name was called over of those whom I remembered something about? friends of my parents, etc.?but one answer came about all?they were all sleeping in the quiet little grave? yard yonder. Having a little time oa my hands I employed it in waining through the cemetery, to dis-over, if pos? sible, the last resting places of these old friends, and as I scanned the linea on tbe stooos I saw there, just aa you enter, was ono, off yootlar another, and so all around in silence they lit), iraltlatf* wait.ng.

HISTORIC SETTIN6 OF A GREAT SERMON - By Rev. M. D. Mitchell at Union Thanksgiving Services EGYPT WAS CRADLE OF WORLD Midway Between Eden and Caleary God Called Abram The historic setting; of tho sermon delivered by Rev.Murray D. Mitch? ell at the union Thanksgiving ser? vices. Trinity Methodist church. Lexington, November 30, 1911, from Psalm 97:1, "Tbe Lord reigneth; let tho earth rejoice", was as follows: "Egypt wan the cradle of the world. She, Jacob-like, held out of her order the birth-right of nations and wus a wayward, ignorant child. A nation should have been founded upon the direct family and tradi? tions of Noah. But Egypt organized government, such as it was. created forms and religious beliefs and culti? vated the primal arts. Menes was the founder of dynasty and Uruhk was their temple builder. The people studied philosophy, surveyed the heavens, carved in stone and wor? shiped every conceivable thing asGod. and believed in the transmi? gration of souls. Withal they were a stern, sedate and passionless race. "It is strange that the first ci viii zation of mankind took place in a country least conducive to the evo? lution of mobility in character?but so God permits. The monotony of landscape and the unyielding heav? ens made the character of the Egyptian what he wus. But a pro* found sentiment evidently swayed the minds of some of their greatest kings. "We must see and admit tbat the weakness of ancient civilization was its ignorance of the true God and the probationary and tempura 1 character of this present world. A very few of their greatest men saw the dim light of truth as the half blind behold thc light of dar. "The old kings looking from their palace windows in Memphis saw the sun set behind tbe western plateau that had parallel with the great river. Musing upon the decline of day, they conceived of building their tombs, the great pyramids, along the crest of the plateau as if they h-ped after death to travel in spirit towards the rising of a new life. Thus these people did the best they could for three thousand long years, and a civilization that occu? pied so long a time in rising and in falling evidently had some tenacious bold upon the essential rock of truth. "Let this be observed of Egypt: She took the world up unorganized, untutored?a mere struggling, scat? tered remnant of the old family stock?she groped forward for two thousand years before her weary shoulders gave out under her bur? den. In the year 2000 of the world's life God found a single man who met his purpose and with him he re [ lieved the people uf the Nile. This man was Abram of the Chaldees, a 1 race descended from Shem, tha sec? ond son of Noah and progenitor of | the Messiah- While whole sectiona j of Asia were sleeping, this virile ! blood of the house of the ark build? er surged through great hearts | that built homes aud cities and states. But they, too, were idola? ter*?in two thousand years of struggle toward the light the world had progressed no further than to plaintively worship the heavenly host?but this worship was pure if it were a tragedy of ignorance. "Here midway between Eden and Calvary God began direct, active ; work in the interest of Christian so? ciety. He called a man to found a people who should become the cus? todians of the written law and through whom a woman should come worthy of becoming the mothar of His only begotten Son. "Abram was God's first man in organized society. Beside many aa altar, under many a starry sky,this man's heart cried out in living I prayer- because upon him devolved | a world, all-time movement.

Tbis is obviously un? true. By its judgment every OOO tract and combination in restraint of inter-State trude made with the purpose of necessary effect of con? trolling prices by stifling competi? tion, or of establishing in whole or in part a monopoly of such trade, is condemned by the statute. The suggestion ts also made that ihe Supreme Court, by its decision in tbe last two cases (Standaru Oil ind American Tobacco) has commit? ted to the coort the undefined and unlimited discretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade s within the terms of tlie statute (Sherman Anti-Trust law.) This is wholly untrue. A reasonable >iraiut of trade at common law is well understood and is clearly de? fined. Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pending, but jur'es have felt averse to con? victing for jail sentence^, and judges have been mest reluctant to impose such seutences on tuen of respect able standing in society whose of? fense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, as tbe offense be? comes better understood and the cotnmittitig of it partakes more of studied aud deliberate defiance of tbe law, we convict individuals and that jail sentences will be imposed. In the recent decisions the Su? preme Court makes clear that there is nothing in the statute which con deuins combinations of capital or mere bigness of plant organized to secure econ >my in production and a reduction of its cost. I see no objection?and indeed I see decided advantage?in the enact? ment of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competi? tion which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose denounced in the Anti-Trust law. They (Federal corporations) should be subject to rigid rules as to their organisation and procedure, including enecti ve publicity, and to the closest supervision as to the issue of stock and bonds by un executive bureau of commission in the Department of Commerce ami Labor, to which in times of doubt they might well submit their pro? posed plans for future business. I recommend that the Federal [charters thus to be granted shall be I voluntary, at least until experience i justified mandatory provisions. Tbe Anti-Trust act is the expres i sion of tbe effort of a freedom-lovinn ! people to preserve equality of op | portunity. It is the result of the confident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by preserving uncontrolled and unrestricted the enterprise of 'the individual, bis industry, his ingenuity, his intelligence and his imiependect courage. panes in the world's literature than i any other, save the Son of Man.
