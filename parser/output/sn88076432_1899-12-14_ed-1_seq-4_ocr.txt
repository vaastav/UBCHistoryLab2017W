MESSAGE. In his messsage to congrees President McKinley to a certain extei.it defers making an author itative announcement of his im perialist policy as applied to the definite and permanent soluuon of the Philippine problem. "It does not seem desirable that I should recommend at this time a specific and final form of govern ment for these islands," he says. To congress is rightfully left the duty of constructing "a plan of government which shall establish aud maintain freedom and order and peace in the Philippines." The promise is made of a special message to b® transmitted to congress when the president shall have received the full report of the Philippine commission, now in preparation. The president's recommenda tions with regard to Cuba are equally evasive and unsatisfying. His message speaks of a new Cuba yet to raise from the ashes of the past"—which might be taken as meaning a free Cuba in accord with the pledge under which we went to war with Spain. But in another breath he expresses a doubt as to whether the ties that are to bind this government to Oubjt in the future "shall be organic or conventional," and de clares ominously that "our mis sion, to accomplish which we took up the gage of battle, is not to be fulfilled by turning adrift a loosely framed commonwealth to face the vicissitudes which too often atteud weaker states whose natural wealth and abundant resources .ire offset by the incongruities of their political organization and the ro carring occasion for internal rival ries to sap their strength and dissipate 'their energies." In other words, now that we have possession of Cub^, it is for us to decide whether we shall relinquish so valuable a possession, paying nn'y a conditional attention to our original pledge for Cuban in dependence. President McKinley's imperial ism is not improved by a mingling of typical Pharisaism. If we pro pose to deny liberty to the Filipi nos and to break our sacred promise to the Cubans, let's at least do it manfully, without any Pecksniffian make-believe. If we hold these islands as Americau colonies, we'll do so simply for thb reason that McKinley's repub lican friends aud backers want to work these islands for profit at the expense of taxpayers in the United States. 

MARK HANNA'S STYLE. Whoever writes the interviews which are credited to United States Senator Marcus A. Hanha should take some pains to make them fit the man. A stout, pep ery, brusque man, who has not enjoyed the blessing of a strictly classical education, such as Mr. Hanna, for instance, would never think of saying to a reporter: "It would be an ungrateful thing for me tn discuss whether or not I will 'in cept another term as chairman of the republican national committee. It would be audicious to discuss an offer that has not been riinde." He would state it in this way: "What, me resign the chairman ship? Don't you believe it, young niau. Homebody has been stuffing you. I'll quit when my time is up and not before, and you can say that for me in your paper, if you like. And you can say, too, that I don't believe Henry C. Payne or any one eise ever said I was too sick to hold the job. Henry nor anybody else would talk of me like that, unless I told them to. No, sir! I have got into this thing and I'm going to see it through." Now that would sound more like Mr. Hanna's style. It would fit his physique and newspaper readers would feel more satisfied that it came directly from the distinguished senator. It takes bat a minute to overcome tickling in the throat and to stop* a cough by the use of One Minute Cough Cure. This remedy quickly cures all forma of throat and lung troubles. Harmless and pleasant to take. It pre vents consiimptiop. A famous specific for irrippo audits after effects. N. B. McGruer. THE Census Bureau is to be the same old political machine the re publicans have invariably made it, and those who control the appoint ments don't care liow much it will cost the people. An indication of this has just been given by the choice of a tabulating machine to be used. The committee decided to use the same machines that were used ten years ago, although a new machine was offered which would do the work much faster. The decision is said to have been made because the new machines, if adopted, would have largely re duced the number of clerks re quired, which republican congress men protested against. DEATH OF MRS. CRAWFORD. An Early Resident Has Passed Through the Beautiful Golden Gates. Mrs. Joseph Crawford, one of the best kn»wn and oldaat residents of Langdon, having come here with her husband and family, in November 1887, died at the family home about 11 o'clock last Satur day night.

The funeral held yesterday Hfternoon was of a private character, beiujr held at the family residence by Kev. Doujjan, assisted by R«vs. Beer aud Robertson The house as tilled with friends, while the long line of carriages that followed the remains to the cemetery showed the respect iu which the deceased was held by the community at large.
