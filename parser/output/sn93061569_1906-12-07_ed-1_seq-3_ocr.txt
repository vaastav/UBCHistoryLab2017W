THE PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL PJIESSAGE TOJPERS Recommends Legislation on New and Important Subjects. INCOME -INHERITANCE TAX He Believes Such Laws Would Curb Growth of Fortunes to Dan gerous Proportions. Hi View on Negro Question Asks for Currency Reform, and Shipping Bill Would Make Citizens of Japs Many Other Important 8ubjects Discussed. Washington, Dec. S. The notable fea tures of President Roosevelt's annual message to congress are his appeal for the enactment Into law of several bills Introduced Into congress last winter and spring; his views on the negro problem; the scoring he gives those whom he terms "preachers of discontent;" the stand he takes for the control of corpor ations by the federal government under the interstate commerce clause of the constitution, and his recommendation for an Inheritance and Income tax law. Many other subjects common to mes sages of the chief executive are touched upon, but the ones mentioned are by far of the greatest Importance. He es pecially urges the passage of the bill prohibiting corporations lrom contribut ing to campaign funds, and also that one which would give the government the rleht of nnpeal In criminal cases. Of this he says: ' Another ulll which has just past one house of the congress and which Is ur gently necessary should be enacted Into law Is that conferring upon the govern ment the right of appeal In criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists In many of the states; It exists In the District of Columbia by act of the congress. It is of course not proposed that In any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently In one district where the government had Indicted certain per sons for conspiracy In connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant's demurrer; while In another Juris diction an Indictment for 'conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under It, and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be In real conflict with each other, but It Is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there Is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when It occurs, to tie solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of Justice re blocked without any real decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill In question. A failure to pass will result In seriously hampering the government in Its effort to obtain Justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the government from obtaining Justice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case where the Judgment of an inferior court has been against them. 1 have specifically in view a recent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district Judge, against what may be the Judgment of the Immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional," and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion." Injunctions. On the subject of the abolition of In junctions In labor disputes, he says: "In my last message I suggested the en actment of a law In connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention hav Ing been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply ing Injunctions In labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of Injunctions In such cases would stand the test of the courts; In which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe It would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of lniuncllons. It Is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands In upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence mere anouia oe no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some sucb law as 1 advocated last year. The Nsgro Problem. The negro problem Is given considera ble attention, after calling attention to the fact that no section of the country Is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynching, and especially as ap plied to the negro of the south. He says the greatest existing cause for mob law Is the perpetration by the blacks of the crime of rape, a crime which he terms even worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years .. ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re 1 cently, and then says: "Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race Is the negro criminal, and above all the ne gro criminal who commits the dread ful crime of rape;and It should be felt as la the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race In particular, for a colored man to fall to help the officers of the law In hunting down with all possible earnestness and seal every such Infamous offender. Moreover. In Aiv Judgment- the crime of rap should always be punished with death, as Is the case with murder: assault with In tent to commit rape should be mad a capital crime,. at least In the discretion of the court; and provision snnuld be jnade by which the punishment may follow Immediately upon the heela of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by Just so much a loosening or tne bands or civ Miration: that the spirit of lynching Inavltably throws Into prominence in tht community all the roul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No maa csn take part In the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means Just so much mora deterioration In all the children who have any knowledge of It and therefore Just so much additional trouble for the next generation pf Americans. "Let Justice be both sure and swift; but let It be Justice under the law, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. Capital and Labor. v On the subject of capital and labor the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says "to preuch hatred to the rich man, as such, . . . to seek to mislead and Inflame to mad ness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which will permit them to ap preciate the danger in the doctrines preached Is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every worthy principle and tradition of Amer ican national life." Continuing on this subject he says: "The plain people who think the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe It to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given pop ular government Is to elect an un worthy and- sinister agitator nn a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an Issue Is raised In this country nothing can be gained by flinching from It, for In such case dem ocracy la Itself on trial, popular self- government under republican forms Is itself on trial. The triumph of the moo is jusi as evil a tnmg as the tri umph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever ir we sucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man. whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal Justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing, or else performing nothing but evil, who would set on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptlonlst. who. lor his own ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by the very wealthy. If we ever let this government fall into the hands of. men of either of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America's past. Moreover, ine nemngog ana corrup tlonlst often work hand in hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prose cutes them when they violate the taw. or who seeks to make them bear their proper share of the public burdens, as being even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There Is nothing to choose between such a re actloniiry and sum an agitator; runda mentally they are alike in their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should join In opposition to anv movement of which the aim Is fearlessly to do exact and even Justice to all. Railroad Employees Hours, He asks for the passing of the bill llm? Itlng the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should be to steadily reduce the number of hours or iHiHir, with as a goal the general in troductlnn of an eight-hour day, but In slsts that on the Isthmus of Panama the conditions are so different from what they are here that the Introduction of an eight-hour day on the canal would be absurd, and continues, "Just about as ab surd as It is, so far as the isthmus is concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the work is done by alien black men or alien yellow men." He urce the enactment of a drastic child labor luw for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a rerteral investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. He reviews the work of the commission appointed to Investigate labor conditions in the coal news of Pennsylvania m iwk, and refers to the wish of the commission "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called the compulsory Investiga tion of controversies between employers and employes when they arise." Control of Corporations. A considerable portion of the message la devoted to the subject of federal con trol of corporations in what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat Inspection and food laws, and anvs that all f these have already Justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat Inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of Insiiectlon on the packers rather than on the government. Continuing on this subject of the control of corporations by the federal government ne says: "It cannot too often be repeated that ex perlence has conclusively shown the Im possibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but Ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state, in some memoa, wneiner y national license law or In other fashion we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at nresent over these great corpora tionsa control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel Hie disclosures bv each big corporation of its stockholders and of Its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the secur ing of Inordinate profits by favored Individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the waeeworkers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that It results In no harm to the people. The reactionary or ultracon servative apologists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism. As a matter of fact it Is these reactionaries and ultraconservatlves who are mem lv must notent In Increasing socialls tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of a dangerous agitation, which la 0 per cent wrong. Is to remedy the 10 per cent of evil as to which the agitation Is well founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental rananhin of railways la to secure by the government on behalf of the people a a whole aucn aaeouaie control sum regulation of the great Interstate com mon c lers as will do away with the evils which give rise to tne agnation against them. Bo the proper antldot in ih danreroua and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such Is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actaally do obtain In con-nn-tinn with the business use of wealth under our present system or rather no svstem of rallure to exercise any aue q'tiate control at all. Home person speak as If the exercise of such governmental control would do away with the freedom n iiwiiviriiiHl initiative and dwarf Indi vidual effort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fall to fiut a premium upon Individual Initiative, ndlvidual capacity and effort; upon the energy, character and foresight which It la so Important to encourage In the individual. Hut as matter of fact the deadening and dering effect of pure socialism, and especially of its extreme twm rommunlim. and the destruction of Individual character which they would bring about, are In part achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results In a single Individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of alt others until his or It rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competi tors to a position of utter Inferiority and subordination. Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer In some way to his belief In the necessity for the curbing of enor mous fortunes, and he has dune so by recommending legislation for both In come and an inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should Impose a graduated Inheritance tax, and. If possi ble, a graduated income tax. He says: 1 am wen aware thai sucn a subject s this needs long and careful study In order that the people may become famil iar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators can work out the project In necessary detail. But I feel that in the near future our nation al legislators should enact a law provid ing for a graduated inheritance tax uy which a steadily Increasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any Individual or corporation. it may ne wen to mane tne tax neavy in proportion as the Individual benefited Is remote of kin. In any event, In my judgment the pro rata of the tax should Increase very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one Individual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition Is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his chil dren well oft. This object can be attained by making the tax very small on moder ate amounts of property left; because the prime object should be to put a con stantly increasing burden on the inher itance or those swollen fortune whicn It is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There can be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thus de termining tne conuitions upon which any gift or Inheritance should be received. Exactly how far the Inheritance tax would, as an Incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or gift of the enormous fortunes In question it Is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress In this direction should be graduul. At first a permanent national Inheritance tax, while it might be more substantial than any such tux has hitherto been, need not approximate, either In amount or In the extent of the Increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately ue. Inheritance Tax Constitutional. Tldn species of tax has avaln and again been Imposed, altho only temporarily, by the national" government. It was Hrst imposed by the act of July ti, 17!7. when the makers of the Constitution were alive and at the head of affairs. It was a graduated tax; tho snuill in amount, the rate was Increased with the amount left to any individual, exceptions being made in the rase of certain close kin. A similar tax was again Imposed by the act of Julv 1. ISM: a minimum sum or $1,000 In personal property being excepted from taxation, the tax then becoming progressive according to the remoteness of kin. The war-revenue act of June 13, 1SH8. provided for an Inheritance tux on anv sum exceeding the value of JlO.OoO, the rate of tax increasing both In accord ance with the amounts lert and in ac cordance with the legatee's remoteness of kin. The supreme court has held that the succession tax Imposed at the time of the civil war was not a direct tax but an imnosc of excise which wus both con stltutlonai ami vana, more recently court, In an opinion delivered uy Air, Justice White, which contained an ex ceedingly able and elaborate discussion of the powers of the congress to Impose death duties, sustained the constitution ality of the Inheritance tax feature of the war-revenue act oi loca ls Income Tax Constitutional? In Its Incidents, and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue, an income tax stands on an entirely differ ent footing from an Inheritance tax, be cause it involves no question of the per petuation or iortunes swonen to an un healthy site. The question Is In Its essence a question of the proper adjust ment of burdens to benefits. As the law now stands It is undoubtedly dim cult to devise a national Income tax which shall be constitutional. nut whether It is absolutely Impossible Is an other nuestlon: and If possible It Is most certainly desirable. The first purely in come tax law was past uy me congress In ISfil. but the most important law deal ing with the subject was that of 1W4. This the court neia to be unconsiiiu "The question Is undoubtedly very In tricate, delicate, and trouble-some. The decision of the court was only reached by ono majority. It Is the law of Uie land, and, of course, Is excepted as such and loyally obeyed by an good citizens Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole In coming to a conclusion, when considered to gether with the previous decisions on the subject, may perhaps Indicate the possibility of devising a constitutional inenme-tax law which shall suhstan tially acccomplish the results aimed at. The difficulty of amending the con stitution Is so great that only real ne cessity can Justify a resort thereto. Every effort should be made In dealing with this suojeci. as witti tne subject nt the nroner control by the national government over the use of corporate wealth In Interstate business, to devise legislation which without such action shall attain the desired end; but. If this falls, there will Ultimately ne no al ternntlve to a constitutional amend menu" Agricultural Interest. He appeals for every encouragement that the congress can give to the agri cultural Interests of the country. He points to the good that is being done by the various iorms ui grange organiza linns, and savs: "Several factors must cooperate In the Improvement or tne farmer s condition. Ha must have the chance to be educated In the whlest possible sense In the sense which keeps ever In view the Intimate relationship between tne tneory oi edu cation and the facts of life. In all education we should widen our aims. It Is a good thing to produce a certain num. ber of trained scholars and students but the education superintended by the state must seek rather to produce a nun dred good citizens than merely one scholar, and It must be turned now and then from the class book to the study of the great book of nature Itself. This Is especially true of the farmer, as has been pointed out again anu again oy an observers most competent to pass prac tlcal ludsment on the problems of oui country life. All students now realize that education must seek to train the executive powers of young people and to confer more real significance upon the Dhrase "dignity of labor." and to pre pare the pupils so that In addition to each developing in the highest degree his Individual capacity for work, they may together help create a right public opinion, and show In many ways social and cooperative spirit, organization nai and It has accomplished much for good in the world of labor. It Is no less neces sary for farmers. Such a movement as the grange movement Is good In Itself and la capable of a well-nigh Infinite fur ther extension for good so long ss It Is ker-t to Its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for mutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological. Marriage and Divorce. As a means of bringing about national regulation of marriage and divorce he suggests a constitutional amendment, and says It Is not safe to leave these ques tions to be dealt with by the various sutes. Continuing on this subject be says: - When home ties are loosened; whe men and women cess to regard worthy family life, with all Its duties fully performed, and all its responsl- uiiies uvea up to, as tne life pest worth living; then evil days for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land, and classes of our population. W-ere the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. Surely It hould need no demonstration to show that wilful sterility la. from the tandpolnt of the nation, from me standpoint of the human race, the one sin for which the penalty Is national earn, race death: a sin for which there Is no atonement: a sin which Is the more dreadful exactly In propor tion as the men and women guilty thereof are In other respects, In char acter, and bodily and mental powers, those whom for the sake of the state It would be well to see the fathers nd mothers of many healthy children. well brought no in homes made haDov by their presence. No man. no woman, can shirk the primary duties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other cause, and retain his or her self-respct. Tne president nsks ror the enactment Into law of a shipping bill that will place American interests on the seas on a oar with those of other countries, and urges especially that something be done that will establish direct steamship commu nication wiin Boutn American ports. Currency Reform. Amendments to the present currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are Inadequate because of the wide fluctuation of Interest charges, he says: "The mere statement of these facta shows that our present system la seri ously defective. There Is need nf change. Unfortunately, however, mnnv of the proposed changes must he ruled rrom consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of compre hension, and tend to disturb existing rights and Interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially Impair the value of the United States two per cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, tne issue of which was made under conditions i. cullarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any special plan. Various Plans nave recently been nronosed lw expert committees of hankers. Among tne pians wnicu are possiniy rcasthle and which certainly should receive your cons deration Is that rcncateillv brought to your attention by the pres ent secretary of the treasury, the es sential features of which have been approved by many prominent hankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should he per mitted to Issue a specified proportion of their capital In notes of a given kind, the Issue to he taxed nt so hlirh a rate ns to drive the notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the Issue of currency to give hanks additional profits, hut to meet the emergency ure- senled by times of stringency. He again asks for rice trade with th Is country for the i'hillpplnes and In the same connection reviews the work done by this country in the islunds, and says "If we have erred In the Philippines it has been In proceeding too rapidly In the direction of granting a large meas ure or sen-government. American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan In Porto Klco should be dredged and Improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Klco should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the af fairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines, Hawaii and our other Insular possessions, should all be direct ed under one executive department; by preference the department of state or the department of war. I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provding for the naturalization or Japanese who come here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our in ternational obligations Is the fact tlr.it the statutes of the I'nlted States gov ernment are entirely Inadequate. They rail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through I'nlted States courts ami by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rights secured to them under selemn treaties which are the law or the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the I nlted otates be so amended and nd'led to as to enable the president, acting for the I'nlted Fsjites government, which Is responsible in our International rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un der treaties. Even as the Inw now is something can be done by the federal government toward this end, and In the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything thut It Is In my power to no will be done, and all or the forces, military and el II, of the I'nlted States which I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to perform and enforce Its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us Into war. The city by Itself would be power less to make defense against the for eign power thus assaulted, and If Inde liendent of this government It would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offend ing community lies in the hands of the I'nlted Stales government. It Is un thinkable that we should continue a pol icy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the I'nlted States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but, in the lust resort, to defending the people who have committed It against the conse quences of their own wrongdoing." Cuban Intervention. The rebellion In Cuba and the Inci dents leading up to the establishment of the provisional government Is reviewed, and the president ssys: "When the election has been held and the new government Inaugurated In peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the Imperative need of pre serving Justice and keeping order in the Island. The I'nlted States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that It shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their Independence. If the elections become a farce, and If the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed In the Island, It Is ab solutely out of the question that the island should continue Independent; and the United States, which has assumed the sporsorshlp before the civilized world for Cuba's career as a nation, would again have to Intervene and to see that the government was managed In such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-government Is always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the Cubans as they tread this difficult parth, I have the utmost sympathy with, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government Is started It shall run smoothly, and with freedom from fla grant denial of right on the opj hand, and from Insurrectionary disturbances on the other." Considerable space Is devoted to the International conference of American re publics and the visit of Secretary Root to South America, and points to the fact that our efforts In behalf of the nations of that country are appreciated by them. On the subject of the Panama canal he promises a special message In the aear future. 

LEGISLATORS O'-'-TilD. New Election Ordered to Be' Hi'd ir Cuba. ' Havana. "By a decree to be Issued noon under specific authority of (ha President of the United States, the seats of all members of the second series of the Cuban Congress elected in 1905 will be declared vacant." This was the announcement made by Governor Magoon Sunday to twenty Ave senators and i3rabcrs of the Honse of Representatives whom he had invited to attend a conference In the palace. After reviewing all the facts devek oped by the peace comniisslou sent tq Cuba by President Roosevelt In re Kponae to President Palma's appeal for Intervention, Governor Magooa called, the attention of tbe members to the fact that the determination as to the stalus of the Congress hud been re served by the peace commission for consideration at Washington. He then communicated to them tho final determination of President Roose velt thut the wats of all senators and, representatives elected' in 1905 shaiL be considered vacant from October 12th, 1906, the vacancies thereby cre ated being filled by an election under the provisional government in accord ance with the proclamation of Secre. tary Taft. Tho first series of senators and rep resentatives elected in 1904 will be con United In office if moral peace, tranquil' lily and public conildeuco be restored lo such an extent that an election for the vacated seats may be held during 1907, and there may be at the same time an election of the successors of representatives whose terms expire De centner 31, 1907, without shortening ; these turma, thus avoiding the necew - sity for two elections. The salaries of i the ousted members will be paid to On- , lober lith, the date fixed by thd peace commission. General Hula Rivera, formsrly secre-. lary of the interior, said to the Asso ciate:! Press that he realized the decrea mer?!;' carried out an obligation of In terest to the peace commissioners, but he greatly deplored it, believing its ef fect would be disastrous. f He said he was firm in the belief that the only means of establishing peace ful conditions consist In tbe election of an entirely new Congress, whereas tho proposed election, which would result In turning over the government to Ub eral control, could result in a new in surrection the moment the American troops were withdrawn from the Island. Tho fact was, said General Rivera that the United States had ignored this, which was patent to all Cubans, and pointed irresistibly to the conclu sion that if the United States withdrew it would be with the full recognition of the necessity for a speedy return antl the consequent extinction of Cuban In dependence. , 

RAILWAY COLLISION.! President of the Southern Railway Company Killed. Lynchburg, Va. Samuel Sp-neer, president of the Southern Railway Company, and recognized as ono ol the foremost men In the development of the Southern states, and six other persons were killed and eleven mora injured early Thursday morning In a rear end collision between two fast patsenger trains, the Jacksonville ex press and the limited, ten miles Eoutli of Lynchburg and a mile north of Lawyers depot. Philip Schuyler, a retired capitalist of New York, was among the killed, to gether with other gucets of Mr. Spen cer. Of those on Mr. Spencer's car. only Mr. Spencer's private secretary, E. A. Merrill of New York, and one of three porters survived the accident. The Jacksonville train came to stop at the crest of one of thd heaviest grades on the road between l'neh burg and Danville. If the trains had come together a mile further Bouth it Is believed that hardly a person on either train would have como out of th? wreck alive. Ten minutes later tho speed would have been upward of sixty miles an hour, and the incoming train, instead of plowing only through President Spencer's private car, probably would have gone through the entire train. One of the worst phases of the ac cident was the heartless manner in which a few passengers and some ot the a t aches, especially some of the porters of the Atlanta train, ran sacked tbe wrecked cars for plunder. Holland Colony Coming. Colorado Springs. A deal was closed Saturday whereby a half Inter est In tbe Fountain Valley Land and Irrigation Company was sold to Hol land capitalists for $150,000 cash. Tbe company, of which W. C. Johnson of Denver Is president, Is an Interest of tho Castlewood Dam Company, also, of Denver. Tbe Holland capitalists will next spring send 1,000 Holland Bet tiers to the valley, which Is south of here. Several thousand more will be scut out druing tbe succeeding years,, and colonization will start on a large' scale. Tbe Irrigation company owns. 12,000 acres In the valley. Japa Coming to Honolulu. Honolulu, T. H. The largest Influx of Japanese laborers tq these Islands: since the treaty between Japan and the kingdom of Havana was made years ago, Is anticipated within tbe next few months. If the present plans of the Japanese Immigration com panies and Japanese hotel keepers are successful at least 20,000 Japanese wilt he landed at Honolulu by next June. There are now between 5,000 and 8,000 young Japanese men who are waiting In Yokohama for the opportunity of coming to Honolulu. -.
