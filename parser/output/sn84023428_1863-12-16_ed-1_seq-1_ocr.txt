The bright sun was just gilding the tall spire of St. Patrick," and from its dome cam i forth, full and clear, the mat in ohue of its hells, striking the hour of 8'even, as I emerged from the door ay of a house where 1 had passed the long hours of the night at the eick bed of a friend. 1 drew my cloak around mo, tied mv "Nubia" ticht over mv ears, and proceeded along the comparatively silent street to my boarding-place, a few blocks distant. I walked briskly along, watch ing the various shopmen, as one after another they removed the shutters, and rearranged for the day's display, the va rious articles of finerey which their win dows contained ; but they failed to inter est, and my' eyes wandered off to the dis tance, where through the bright autumn foliage, I caught glimpses of the noble old stone mansions and palaces of the rich and noble, surrounded by their ex tensive parks where among the many tint ed leaves which strewed th turf, the gen tle deer, just opening their bright eyes to greet the morning, sported and gambol ed among the flowers,' and sunshine; I felt in heart the stirrings of envy, and I wondered, could Paradise have been more sweetly beautiful ; when between me and my fairy vision .loomed up the Court House and I noticed that there hud al ready begun to assemble, crowds of men eager to hear every iota of the impending trial of a man for the murder of a wom an and three children. - This doomed man's home was in one of those same princely palaces; wealth , rolled in streams at his feet, but alas, even into Eden, sin entered, and left his slimy trail on every shrub and flower,- even so into the beautiful home of the rich man the Devil entered, aud he fell! Shuddcringly I turned away, and my eye fell upon the dark robed furm of a 'sisterof charity," just emerging from one of those low white-washed cottages which are thickly interspersed over the city, and which are inhabited by the more respectable class of the poor, and whose low humble walls in contrast with the homes before mentioned, seem to whisper distinctly in one's ear the wordb of our Lord, " The poor ye have always with you." As she passed me, I looked in her face, almost expecting to seo gleams of celestial glory encircling her, but I saw only the faded brow bound round by the white 'kerchief and the black veil and gown of her order, and from my inmost heart I said " God bless thee, Sister of Charity.' " Roman Catholic though they are, I would give honor to whr.ru honor is due, and I believe hearts true and wom anly, beat in their breasts, prompting to deeds st which angels might not blush; entering the chambers of sickucss, and pestilence, moistening . the feverish lips, and aching brow, in silence closing the eyes of tho dead, raising the languid head their presence falls on many hearths like sunshine on the walls of ,a prison. Blessed are the "Sisters of Charity." Though I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not chari- " ... i . j ty; I am become as sounding Drags ana tinkling cymbal." " I cannot eat it Mother, it isn't good. but i am very hungry, I am." I turned in the direction from which the voice pro ceeded, and saw that it came through the broken panes of a low cellar window at my feet, and a soft trembling voice an swered " well, my angel, if Toronto will Af ford bread, you shall have it,"; the door opened, and a woman ascended the stairs leading . to the street, and passed me quickly; a few steps down the walk .1 ' . '; saw her stop before the open windows of 5 baker's shop and taking a loaf of bread turned to retrace her , steps, when' the heavy hand of fi policeman fell upon her shoulder. ' 1 $h dropped this loaf as the cold voioo ell upon lie ear, " well done, YAA lint vAti' r.' Anniyb f.

I beg that you : OA ' J ! w.ll allow me to execute my business un- assisted." , This was a severo rebuff. but!wbo11? -interesting to your readers. But I felt that the case demanded all my pow ers of persuasion, else the child might be left to starve alone. " At least" said I " if I cannot per suade you, come with me to her home. It is only a few steps, and as I pointed out the place " ; he consented, and as the poor woman pushed open tho rickety door and displayed to our eyes the low cellar room, and its contents, the man started with surprise. The floor was faultlessly clean, and the room was lighted by two small windows opening even with the pavement, and contained no furniture save at one end of what appeared to be an old packing-box set up on end to serve for a table, to hold two or three coverless books and a large Bible. The walls were damp and black with mildew, and no fire though the day was cold. In one corner least ex posed to the wind fiom the door and win dows, stood one of those old fashioned bed-steuds made like a camp-slool, to open or shut at pleasure, and on this, without mattress or covering save a thin worn quilt, lay a girl of about sixteen years of age, dying of consumption, the transpar ent 6kin barely held the large blue eyes in their sockets, and tho spirit looking out through them from its skeleton prison bouse was struggling painfully for release. She raised her thin hands quickly, and grasped the bread, eating heartily. It was a death-hunger, for she soon fell back exhausted, and a fit of coughing came on und as it ceased, we heard the death-rattle in her throat, I saw the gasp, and, she ceased to breathe. Meanwhile I had not noticed the policeman, who stood by the window, his back towards us, but as he turned to leave the house, I saw a bright drop fall upon the gilt buttons of his coat, and then another, as he laid a five pound note on the open Bible, and stepped into the street. I now for the first time addressed the woman, and learn ed from her, her sad story. She was a Ger man by birth, of good parentage and well educated; but being left a widow without means of support, she had come with her only child to America to seek a living by teaching musio. The daughter was frail, and us she drew on toward womanhood her strength decreased until consumption settled upon her, and forced the mother to quit her employment to at tend upon her child ; exposure, fatigue, and over exertion, brought on parylsis and the right arm of the mother became useless. Books, music, and musical in struments all went for food and rent; and when uo more remained, they had remov ed to the cellar to starve in silence, and alone. Poor woman t as she bent above the remains of the last link which bound her love to earth. She f pressed the life less head to her bosom, and meekly bowed her own and murmered, "father I thank , tlipf. " 1 All wns ini)ril now ! th bone, the four, and the sorrow. ; all the dull deep pain, and the constant anguish of patience ; all was over. The : bells of the city were ringing the hour of noon, as 1 stepped once more into the crowded street, and swept onward by the surging muss. I had small chance to moralize, j 'but t could; hut blessed be death j .!... it Ar.n ontox nihora. if 11 VS more since it often enters' where it is even more welcome than life !

National Hotel. Washington, U. V., Deo. 6th, 1863, Mr. EniTOR : It being my fortune to' be detained in this city for a few weeks, just at this time, when Congress is to meet in one of the raoBt mP"t sessions that rcu lu 118 "uule nwwry, i PertaPs f odental jottings m? V. upon the occurrences of the 0ca8IOn' nd the doings of " P0we.rs tba be' m,Sht not Prove as congress does not meet until to-morrow, it will be necessary to compile my present letter from outside matters. I left Chicago, one week ago to night, and arrived here on the morning of the first instant, finding the city presenting a far more lively and business like appear ance, than it did on my former visit three months ago. The president is keeping himself strict ly out of sight, and is engaged in cora- pleting his message, which report says will be quite radical in its character, and will probably be delivered next Tuesday morning. You have undoubtedly heard of Meade's rccrossing the Uapidan. Probably it will be stigmatized as another failure, and many papers are predicting Meade's re moval thereupon. But there is scarcely a doubt that this forward , movement of meade was simply a feint to assist indi rectly our operations in the vicinity of Chattanooga, by drawing off Longstreet from Burnside, aud so compelling Bragg to fall back toward Dalton. I do not be lieve from all the information I can gath er, that Meade's intention contemplated J any further object than this; except that in case ho should find by this rcconnoi sanco iu force, that Lee's poitiou and force were sneh as to warrant an attack : then of courne, he was prepared to do so. So as far as the rumor of Meade's removal goes, it is simply a supposition of those who have entirely misconceived the real intention contemplated by this movement. And here I bring this introductory epis tle' to a close. W. E. M. Dbatu op Major Jarvis. A letter to the Boston Traveler from Beaufort, N. C, Dec. 2d, gives this account of the death of Major Jarvis : Major Jarvis, of the Ninth Vermont Infantry Regiment, a part of which is stationed at Newport Barracks, on the line of the Beaufort and Newborn Rail road, was killed by a secesh cavalry man, yesterday. The Major was in command of a scouting party, and when in the vi cinity of Whiteoak Kiver, himself and Or derly being somewhat in advance of his party, struck tho trail of horsemen, aud sodn came in sight of three "cavaliers," fleeing for dear life. The Orderly, a mem ber of the .'id New "York Cavalry, first overhauled them, and engaged ons, and the Major soon came to his assistance. Both parties were firing their pistols at each other, until the last cartridge was discharged, during which Major Jarvis received two bullets, and lived but three hours after. One of the secesh was killed, an anttther escaped, and the third, who I killed the Major, was finally captured by the N. Y. Cavalry boy John Henry who commenced the fight 1 he prisoner said his party had been home on a fur lough, to a point within our lines, and were returning to their regiment. Major Jarvis was an excellent officer, and much beloved by his regiment and all who knew him We have received the following, sent us by Lieut. C. ll. Hodge, of Stowe:' ' Whereas, it having plcasd an all-wise Providence to remove from us.our esteemed friend and brother in arms, Major Charles Jarvis, who fell mortally wounded iu an ' cucounter with the enemy near Cedur Point N.
