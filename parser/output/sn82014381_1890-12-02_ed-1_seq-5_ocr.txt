He was ou bis way to Sitting Bull's camp, w hen a courier overtook him with dispatches countermanding his 7.revious oiders. It appears that the Interior Department, acting under the advice of Agent McLaughlin, would not permit the arrest of fcitting Bull. General Milei and Buffalo Bill were cf the opinion that his arrest would end the agitation. McLaughlin believes that the present cold wave will stop the trouble. The mi'itary is strong enough at all points, it is now believed, to protect the settlers, and the trouble is believed to be over. -NF.IVOHi.BLE

Schaefer won, making SOO points, when Slossou bed only scored 609. In the seventh inning Schaefer made a run of b. points, amii great applause. Slossou was evidently a little nettled by thia. but succeeded in makirg 42 before he stopped. Schaefer made 1-0 in the eighth innings, and Siosson 19. The thing went on then without any larger runs until the seventeenth inning, when Jake by beautiful playing, .cored 7:1 points. The score then stood. Schaefer 247, Slossou 162. In the nineteenth Schaefer gave a wonderful display, getting the ivories on the line. He played them back and forth as if on a wire. He reached and passed the hundred mark safely, and still kept oa gently ticking the iV-iieß The audience sat breathlessly waiting, and Schaefer finally stopped after making 12s. paints. Siosson looked feverish, and he missed an easy shot after making ten points. From this time on the wizard's excellent play ing seemed to have rattled Slossou sadly. At the end of the twenty-second inning the score stood: Schaefer 413, Slcsson 223. Betting was three and four to one against Siosson. In the twenty-fourth Jake scored 7_ mere points, while slossou mad? four. In the twen ty-seventh Schaefer made 27 and Slossou 42. The score at the end of the twenty-ninth was: Schaefer, 543; Siosson, 324 In the thirty-sec ond Schaefer gave another great exhibition of nursing, and rolled up eight pomts. Siosson seemed to play hard, and yet some of his errors would have shamed au amateur. Afterward he did better than Jake, but it was too late. He made two runs of 60 and one of 59, but in the forty-first inning Schaefer ran out the eight hundred, leaving Siosson at 600. The averages were: Schaefer, 19 21-41: fcloseon, 14 26-41. SENATOR STANFORD. He is a Candidate for No Office Except Senator. Washington, December Ist.—The California Associated Press correspondent called upon Senator Stanford to-night. He said he could not pass an opinion on the President's message, because he had not read it carefully. The cor respondent called his atteutio i to the report that a "Blame and Stanford" ticket would be one of the possibilities for I.L-2. He responded: "You can say for me that I am uot a candidate lor any office except that of Senator." When csked if he expected the Farmers' Alli ance in the Convention at Ocala. Florida, to in dorse his land loan bill or something similar, he said he had no mode of ascertaining what the sentiment of the Conventioh would be, but ex pressed confidence that the farmers generally would ultimately indorse just such a scheme as he had proposed. Senator Stanford thinks the country is begin ning to appreciate what at first was regarded as a visionary and chimerical financial scheme. He announced his intention of pushing it again during this session. Senator Stanford will offer in the Senate to morrow a memorial from the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, urging the establishing of a training ship in San Francisco harbor, and recommending the United States ship Hartford for this purpose. Stanford will also present a memorial from the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, asking for the protection of San Diego harbor by mili tary fortifications. . •

Irish Members of the Commons Discuss the Situation. Losiios, December Ist.—The meeting of Irish members of the Commons to consider what action the Nationalist party shall take lv regard to the leadership took place at uoon. Parnell was the first to arrive. He took the chair aud called the meeting to order. Telegrams from the delegates in the United States and from Archbishop Croke were read. An adjournment was then taken for luncheon. Prior to the meeting Parnell held a conference with his supporters. Joseph Nolan. Kennv, John Red mond, William Redtno.d, Edward Harrington, Power, Shiel aud o'Kelly were present at the .conference. The proceedings of the meeting were cf the stormiest character. Parnell's supporters strove hard to secure another adjournment, urging that the meeting to decide the question of lead ership of the Irish party should be held in Dub lin. Bexton hotly protested against an adjourn ment. The majority of the party, he aeelared, desired to keep the leadership of the pirty un sullied ard unstained. Sexton's remarks were frequently interrupted by tremendous cheering from Parnell's opponents, who composed the majority of those present. r.edmond made a passionate appeal to the members to pause before they deposed from his rightful positiou the leader of the Irish nation, who by his unparalleled services had earned the gratitude ot the Irish people. Alter K?dmond bad finished Parnell ad dressed the meeting, spying :u substance: "The time has come when 1 must speak out ogaiust the opposition within our party, wbicn has been created by Gladstone's letter. The men whose ability has been most conspicuously ex ercised against me—Healy and Sexton—will have to bear the responsibility. Healy has been trained in this warfare. Who telegraphed to him in America to come back? Who gave him his first chance to enter public life, and get him a seat in Parliament? Mr. Healy reminds me of his services. He hasn't been slow to re mind me of them at any time. I understand he attended a recent meet ing in Lublin, calling on me not to re tire. Who asked him to uo so? Who asked McCarthy to travel to Dublin and say he would be ai' c to give information which would throw a different complexion op the hidden events. Where was Sextou at this same meetine? Where were you all 1 Why did you encourage m. to maintain the leadership in- the face of tbe world il you were not going to stand by me? Why did my officers encourcg. me to take a position on the bridge, if they were going to act as traitors and hand me over to another commander-in-chief.' I Cid not ask them for a certificate of character given at the Dublin meet ng." Referring to the Hawarden proposals, Parnell said Gladstone told him none of them were final. "J*or me," ssid Parnell, "it was a ques tion oi drafting a bill. It was a question of weak judgment on the part of an J-'nglish poli tician. It was a question of dealing with . garrulous old gentleman, who monopolized the conversation, and with whom, as everybody who knew him knows, it is difficult to get in a word edgeways. Before jou vote for my desposi tion, be sure you are getting the value for it. On Saturday we were al! agreed thai we would not have this Gladstone bill. Not a man here has snid a word in favor of it. Are you sure you will be able to get anything better? If Healy or Sexton or McCarthy see the way clear to get anj thing better, for God's sake let them get it. I won't stand in their way." Joseph Nolan submitted an amendment to the effect that the question ot retirement should be postponed until the members personally aseer taine I the views of their constituents, the pa- ty then to meet in Dublin and decide the matter. Parnell ruled cut of order any reference to his conduct in the G'Shea case, acd this brought him into frequent collision with diflerent speak ers, especially Healy. wi'h whom Parnell ex changed hot words. He displayed great passion throughout. At midnight the meeting ad journed until noon to-morrow. British Grain Market. Loscos. December Ist.—The .Var .. Lane Ex press says English wheat is firm.

In view of these conditions, I refrain from bringing before you at this time some sugges tions that would otherwise be made, and most earnestly evoke your attention to the duty of perfecting the important legislation now well advanced To some of those measures, which setm to me inoit important, I now briefly call your attention. 

AM-RICAN STEA._S.IIP LUTES. I de.-ire to request, with added urgency, the recommer datiou contained in my last annual menace i_ relation to the development of American steamship lines. Tho reciprocity clau-.e of the tariff bill will be largely limited, and i'.s benefits retarded and diminished, if a provision is not contemporaneously made toen eoorag- tte establishment of Sub-class steam inic&tlon between our ports and the ports of such nations as may meet our overtures for enlarged commercial exchanges. The steam ship carry::..- the mails steadily and frequently ,-.:. .. fttnng to passengers a comfortable, safe ami spec ly transit, i:. tbe first condition of for eign trade. It carries the order o the Luver, but not al! that is ordered or bought. It gives to int.- sailing v. sseis such cargoes as are not ir.:- Dt or perishable, and indirectly, at least, promt tes that import adjunct of commerce. Here i* now, both in this couutry and ia the nations ot Central aud South America, exnecta ti.-n.nd confidence as to the iucreased'tr.de that trill give a double value to your [romp; action upon this question. The present situa tion of our mall f o__municatiou with Acstralia illustrates the important-.- of early action by Congress. The Oceanic Steamship Company maintains a line of steamers between Sau Francisco, Sydney and Au.kland, coushting of three veFsels, two oi which are of United ..tates registry and one of foreign registry. For the service done by this line iv ca: ryiug the mails, we pay annually the sum of f46,000, being estimated the full tea acd Cnited Mates inland postage, which is the limit iixod by law. The colonies of New South Wales and New Zealaud have been paying an nually to those lico ti7,OCO forcarryiug the mails from Sydney and Auckland to San Kran c;>co. The contract under which this payment has beeu made is nov.- about to expire, and tho^e colonies have refused to r.-new the con ir_cii nnless the United States shall pay a more equitable proportion ot the turn necessary to hold the service. 1 am advised by the Postmaster-General that Ihe United States received for carrying the Australian mails brought t_ San Francisco in these steamers by rail to Vancouver, au esti mated annual income of 175,000, while, as I have stated, we are paying bnt for the support o: the steamship line that brings this mail to us Gnly :-16,000, leaving annually a surplus re sulting irom this service oi $19,0 0. The trade of the United States with Aus tralia, which is in a considerable part car ried by these steamers, and the whole cf which is practically dependent upon the mail coni muniea.sc.ii which they maintain, is largely in oar favor. Our total exports ot merchandise to Australian ports during the fiscal year ending June SO, 189), were 511.266,1.4. while the total imports of merchandise lrom these ports were oniy S_,-.7,6:6. Ii we are not willing to see this imt»rtcnt Steamship line withdrawn tr continued, with Vancouver substituted for sau Francisco as the American terminal, congress should put it in the power oi the Postmaster-'.eueral to make a liberal increase in the amount now paid for the transportation of this important mail. The South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a very favored position towards the new and im portant commerce which the reciprocity clause of the Tariff Act and the Postal Shipping bill aie designed to promote. Steamship lines'from these po:ts to some northern poit of Booth America will almost certainly effect a connec tion between the railroad systems o.'the conti nent loug before any continuous line of rail road can be put iv operation. The very large appropriation made at last ses sion for the harbor of Galveston was jU'.Uii-.d, as it seemed to be by these considerations that the great Northwest wiil feel the advantage of a trunk iine to the South, as well as to the Fast. and ot the new markets opened for the supply of food products and for many of their manufact ured products. 

INTE_KATIO..\_I. AMEI.tCAX BANKS. I had occasion in May last to transmit to Con gress a report adopted by the International American Conference upon the subject oi the ineor.Kiration of an international American bank, with a view to faciiitatiug money ex change between tne States represented in "that conference. Such an Institution would greatly promote the trade we are seeking to develop. I renew the recommendation that a earef.i and well guarded charter be granted. I do not think the power granted should include those ordinarily exercised by true guarantee and s_fe deposit companies or that more branches in the United States should be authorized than are strictly necessary to accomplish the object pri marily in view, namely, convenient ioreisu exchanges. It is quite important that prompt action should be taken in this matter, in order that any appropriations for better communication with these countries, and any agreement that may be made for reciprocity of trade may not be hindered, acd for the convenience of making exchanges throughout Europe, and the money centers widened by the tribute which is an event of Hint method of business. A bill forthe relief ot the Supreme Court has, after many" years of discussion, reached a posi tion when finsl action is easily attainable, and it is hoped that any differences of opinion may be so merged as to save the essential featu-es of this very important measure. In this connec tion, I earnestly renew mv leeommeudation that the salaries of Judges of the Cnited States District Courts be readjusted, that none of them shall receive less than 15,006 per auuum. MEXICAN LAND GRANTS. The subject of adjusted Spanish nad Mexican land grants, and the urgent necessity for pro ducing some Commission or tribunal for final treatment of the question growing out thereof, was twice brought by me to the atteution of Congress at the lis' session. Bills have been re ported from tbe proper Commissions aud both Houses on the subject, and I very earnestly hope that this Congress will put aneudtothe delay which has attended the settlement of dis putes as to titie-bcaring settlers and claimants under these grants. Tnese disputes retard pros perity aud distract the peace ol large and im portant communities. SMALL HOLDXHGS OF FALM LANDS. The Governor of New Mexico, in his last re port to the Secretary of the Interior, suggests some modifications of the provision of pending bills relating to small holdings of farm lauds. I commend to your atteution the suggesiionsof the Secretary of the Interior upon this subject. National eankk.ft law. The enactment of a national bankrupt law I still regard as very desirable. The Constitu tion having given to Congress jurisdiction of this subject, it should bo exercised and uniform rules provided for the administration ol the af fairs of insolvent debtors. The inconvenience resulting from the occasional and temporary exercise of this power by Congress and from the couilicting State codes of msolvtncv, which come ints force intermediately, should bs re moved by the enactment of a simple, i .ex pensive and permanent national bankrupt law. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. I also renew my recommendation in favor of legislation affording just copyright protection for foreign authors on a footing of reciprocal advantage for authors abroad. ■anOOIBM ALAINST RAILWAY ACCIDENTS. It may still be possible for this Cojgress to inaugurate, by suitable legislation, a move ment looking to uniformity and an increased safety iv the use of couplers and brakes upon freight trains engaged in interstate commerce. 'Ihe chief difficulty in the way is to secure an agreement as to the best appliances, simplicity, effectiveness, and cost being considered. The difficulty will only yield to legislation which should be based upon full inquiry and impar tial tests. The rurpose should be to secure the co-operation of all well disposed managers and owners: but the fearful fact that every years delay involves the sacrifice ot _:,..0 lives, and the maiming of 20,000 young men. should plead both with Congress and managers acaiust auy needless delay. WJ.TCB BOTFLY. The subject of the conservative and equal distribution of the water supply of arid re gions has had much attention irom Congress, but has not as yet been put up in a permanent end satisfactory basis. The urgency of the subject does not grow out of any large preseut demand for the use of the lands for agriculture, but out of the danger that tbe water supply and the sites for the necessary catch basins may fall into the hands of individual or private corpo rations, and be used to render subservient large areas dependent on such supply. The owner of water is the owner of the lands, however the titles may run. Allunappropriated water sources and all nec essary resurveys should be held by the Govern ment for equal use, at fair rates.'of the home stead settlers, who will eventually take up these lands. The United States should not, in my opiuion, undertake the construction of dams or canals, but should limit all work to such sur veys and observations as will determine the water supply, both surface and subterranean, the areas capable of irrigation, and the use of the storage capacity of reservoirs. This done. Ihe use ot the water and of the leservoir sites might be granted to the respected States or Territories, to individuals or associations, upon the condition that the necessary works should be constructed and the water furnished at fair rates, without discrimination, the rates to be subjected to provisions by tee Legislatures, or by Boards of Water Commi.sioner', duly con stituted. The essential thing to be secured is the common and equal use, at fair rates, of the accumulated water supply. It were almost bet ter that these lands should remain and, than that those who occupy them should become the slaves of restrained monopolies controlli.g the essential element of land values and crop re sults. FOSTAI. TELEGRAPH. The use of the telegraph by the Postoffice Department as a means for the transmission of written communications is, 1 believe noon proper terms, quite desirable. The Government does not own or operate the railroads, and it should not, I think, own or operate the tele graph lines It does, however, seem to be quite practicable for the Government to contract with the telegraph, as it does with the railroads, to carry, at specified rate 3, such communicetiins as the sender may desiguate for this method of transmission. I recommend that such 'egisla tion be enacted as will enable the Postoffice De partment fairiy to test, by experiment, the ad vantages of such a use of the telegraph. FREE AND HONE.T ELECTIONS. If any intelligent and loyal companyof Amer ican citiz ns were required to catalogue the essential human conditions of national life, I do not doubt that with absolute unanimity they would begin with "free and honest elections,'' and it is gratifying to know that generally there is a growing and nor. partisan demand fbr bet ter election laws. But against this sign of hope and progress must be eet the depressing and un deniable fact that the election laws and meth ods are sometimes ennningly controlled to in sure minority control of the whole volume and complete the shortcoming of fraud In my last annual message I suggested th&t the adoption of the existing law providing a FeCeral super vision of Congressional electors, offered an effective method of reforming these abuses. The need of such a law has manifested itself in many parts ol .he country, a_<J its wsojesoßs restraints and penalties will be useful. In all the con.titutionaiity of such legislation has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. Its prob able effectiveness is evidenced by the character of the opposition that is made to it. It has been as pionounced as if it were a new exercise ol Federal power and an invasion of th-rights of the States Nothing could be further from the truth. Congress ha? already fixed the time for the election of members of Congress. It has de clared that the vote for members of Congress must be by written or printed ballot: it has pro vided for the appointment by the Circuit Court \ in certain cases, upon the petition of a certain number of citizens, of election supervisors, and made it their duty to supervise the registration of voters conducted by ihe Stste officers; to challenge persons offering to register; to pers_>n- Blly inspect and scrutinize the registry lists, and to affix their names to the lists .'or the purpose of identification and the prevention of frauds. to attend at elections, and remain with the boxes until the votes are all cast and counted: to attach to the registry lists a.id election re turns any statement touching th>' accuracy ard fairness of the registry ana elections, and to take and transmit to the Clerk of the Hon. c of Representatives any evidence of fraudulent practices which may bt. presented t - them. Tbe same law provides for the appointment of a Deputy United States Marshal to atteud at the polls and support the Supervisors in the dis charge o! their auti.s, and to arrest persons v;o- ; lating the election laws. The provisions of this familiar title of the revised stitutes have been put into exercise by both the great political par ties, ar.d in the North as well as in the _ rath, by the filing with the Court of the petitions re c.uirt Iby law. Itis not, therefore, a question whether we shall have a Federal election law, for we now have one, ard have hed for near!v twenty years, bu. whether we shall have an ef fective law. The present law stops jast short of effectiveness, for it surrenders hi tbe local au thorities ail control over the ceitifieation which establishes prima lacit right to a seal in the House of Representatives. This defect should be cured. Equality of representation and the purity of the electors must be maintained, or everything that is valuable in our svstetn of government is lost. The qualification of an elector m 1 st be sought in tne law, not in the opinion, prejudices or fear of any class, how ever powerful. The path of the elector to the ballot-box must be free from ambush of fear and the enticement of fraud: the count so true and open that none shall gainsay it. Such a law shall be absolutely non-partisan and impartial. It should give the advantage to honesty and the control to ma j.rites. Surely there is nothing sectional about this creed. If it shall happen that the penalties of laws intended to enforce these rights fall here, and not there, it is not because the law is sectional, but because, happ.lv. crime is local, and not universal. Nor should it be forgotton that every law, whether relating to elections or any other subject, whether en acted by tbe Estate or by the nation, has force behind it. The Courts, the Marshal, or Con stable, the posse ?oinitatus, the prisons, are all and always behind the law. One cann-.t be justly charged wih unfriendliness to any sec tion or elan who seeks oniy to restrain viola tions of the law and of personal rights No conimu-iity will find lawlessness profitable. No coreniunity can afl. ret to have it known that the officers who are ch.rgtd with the preserva tion of the public peace, and the restraint of the criminal classes, are themselves the product of fraud or violence. The magistrate is then with out rest and the law without sanction. Tne .ioods of lawlessness can be levied and made to run iv one channel. The killing of an United States Mars.nl, carrying a writ of arrest for an election offense, is full of prompting and offense to men who are pursued by a City Marshal fir a crime against lite and property. " But it is said that this legislation will revive animosities, and some have even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made impossible, they may be supplanted by intimidation ar.d violence. If the proposed law gives auy qualified elector by a hair's weight more than his equal imiuence. or detracts by so much from any other unqualified elector, it is fatally impeached. But il the law is equal, and the animosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors bave been accustomed to exercise the franchise for others as well as for themselves, then these animosities ought not to be confessed without shame, and cannot be given any weight in the discussion without dis honor. No choice is left to me but to enforce with vigor the laws intended to secure to the citizen his constitutional rithts, aud to recommend that the inadequatenes. of such laws oe promptly remedied. If to promote with zeal and ready interest every project for the devel opment of its material interests, its rivers, har bors, mines and factories, and the intelligence, peace and security under the law of its com munities aDd its homes, is not ae.eDted as suffi cient evidence of friendliness to any State or section, I cannot add connivance at election practices that not ouly disturb local results, but rob the election ot other States and sections of their most priceless political rights. 

EX-ENMTI'RES SHOVI.P BE SCRUTINIZED. The preparation of the general appropriation bill should be conducted with the greatest care and closest scrutiny of expenditures. Appro priations should be adequate to the needs of the public service, but they should be absolutely free from prodigality. I venture again to remind you that the brief time remaining ior the consideration oi the im .mrtant legislation now awaiting your attention offers no margin for waste. If the present duty is discharged with diligence and courage, the work of the Fifty-first Congress may be confi dently .übmitted to the considerate judgment of the people. Ben.iamis Harrison.
