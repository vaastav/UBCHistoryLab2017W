THE LEXINGTON INTELLIGENCER, SATURDAY DECEMBER 15, lfOQ Intelligencer. L. W. OKOVES, Editor awl Publisher, TERMS. I I II. CQ A YEAR (Inly such bills have H anna's O. K. will be passed by tho present Con gress. Congress ou passed a bill lo Include cherries lo lb list of frnit horn which brandy may be distilled. The l,ooiaiana Frees comes to our tal.le this week la holiday attire. Tbr Frees is always la lb (root. Bob While says everyone .should read the president's message. We would like lor him to tell us wby. The Missouri Telegraph has com pleted lis sixty-first year of usefulness and we trust It may flourish as much longer. A Monroe oounly woman recently kitted twelve wild ducks at one shot and now people are wondering what she was shooting at. Saline county lost 6 in population durine the last decade land her people ironsolc themselves by thinking ol Cooper county's greater loss. The Democrat-News is dissatisfied with the population given Marshall by the recent census and proposes to take a census on in own account. A negro in St. Louis bet that a sound of feathers was heavier than a pound of lead and dropped them on his feel to prove it. He knows. What is the value of a kiss Adel Kelson, a stenographer in San Fran- ciaoo, Is suing her employer for 910,000 because he slipped up behind her and kissed her, It Is said that some Chicago preach ers are thinking of Introducing vaude ville feat ores In their church services to make them draw bettor. Why not try bettor sermons t The newspapers in Saline eountj report the Jail empty and still Insist I bat I he county ought to build a Dew one. What does such a moral com ruunirj need with a Jail P The Kevsda Director has been pur chased by II. E. Smith and its name changed to the Vernon Connty lemo orat. We wish tho Democrat a long and prosperous eiistenoe. In a case that went up from Tennes see the supreme osurt of the United States bas decided that a state baa the right to regulate or prohibit the sale of cigarettes within Its boundaries. Newt Bryson says be would rather lose a postoflioe and be for Bryan than to hare one under McKlnley. If all democrats were as trne to their princi ples as this we could be for Bryan and win. - Geo. W. Trigg, of the Richmond Conservator, is an applicant for rail road commissioner. Mr. Trigg claims to have discovered Mr. Dockery and i surely ought to be in on the ground floor. Kooeevelt is starting a small boom for president for 1904. Better be sure that Mark Haana is not to enter the field. He would make Teddy look like thirty cents In less than twenty minutes. The most eipensive hickory nuts in the world are raised In Cooper country. At least one man has sued another for 10,000 because be received a postal card from him warning bin not to remove any more hickory nuts from Ms land. A justice of the peaoe lo Callowey ounty used the whipping post ia lien of a jsil sentence and thereby saved the county about (200 in costs. A whipping post for minor offenses would save tbe state of Missouri thoussods upon thousands of dollars annually, and we hope the day Is pot far distant when we may have such a law. The Kansas City Independent bas disoovered that;Joepb Flory la entitled la hold over as railroad commissioner until 190J or else should be succeeded by the republican candidate for the position. In case of McKinley't death before March ilb we suppose then that Iiryan should be president, as having received tbe next highest vote tor the office. The Independent should guess again. A Sbelbina bachelor, out of patienoe with tbe flies which invaded his room, got two sheets of sticky fly-paper which be placed upon chairs near a window. Returning late that evening he forgot the tanglefoot and.sat down la one of the chairs. He soon got np and proceeded to pick tbe paper off the south end of his trousers. Ai It was a bad place to get at be took the pantaloons off, and while cloaning I hem unoonsclously sat down in the other chair and then stood up and meditated. An Everyday Ueenrrenee. A newspaper man was asked to publish an article roasting" a oitisen. Certainly" be said to tbe caller, what shall I say" He was furnished with aa outline of what he w anted aod wrote aa article that was a scorcher. "That's splendid," eiclaitned the frisud when tbe article was read to him, "that is right and it'll make his old hair crinkle." All right," ssid the editor, let me see, what are your initial" Good Heavens," said the cltlsen, you are not going to sign mv nsois to that!" "Why notf "asked the editor. "I wouldn't bsve auyone to know 1 had anything lo do with that for tbe world. I can't afford lo get Into a scrap with my neighbors. " The 'litor sailed benevolently and Midi Why should I mil np io a scrap that does sot eoneern mtt Wby should I aeaain the blame for tbe publication ol aa article lo which you are afraid to sign your kamer" The auau stopped bis safer sat went away mad. THE 

YIXLOW PERIL. Tbe current number ol the Cosmo politan contains one ol the most Interesting and instructive articles on tbe Chinese question that we have read since lbs memorable Boxer movement of tbe past summer. It comes from the pea of Sir Robert Hart, an Kn gliahman, who has been prominent in Chinese matters fur a quarter of century. If we accept bis statements aa true, and we certainly could not accuse him of a partiality for China, we are forced to tbe conclusion I bat tbe Chinees acted much as any other nation mien! have done under similar eucumstaucee. The Boxer organisation, in its Inoep tion, was purely patnotio and Iheie is o doubt but that it began active operations from purely patriotic motive. That Its attack upon tbe legations was mistaken leal and puts China in the class of barbarians is not disputed, bnt tbe desire to preserve China tor Chinese is the same motive that would call to arms every man in America should the European powers attempt to force on us conditions simi lar to those that have been fastened on China io recent years. China may or may not be Civilised according to our cannons, but H is a civilised country according to Chinese cannons and the spirit that moves her people to preserve tbe empire is worthy one The disturbance baa been lulled for a time and what bow? We will sop pose that the present trouble shall be amicably arranged and things shall go on as they were. Tbe Chinese have diseoved that lo do effective fighting 'they must lay aside their primitive weapons and adopt tbe modern gno. This they have done in a measure and will do more and more. They are imitating much from western civiliza tion and adapting it to eastern sur rounding. The Boxer patriot of the future will possess tbe best guns that money can buy. It has already been demonstrated that they respond to tbe call for duty to a man. Then indeed will the "Yellow Peril" be a serious matter. Wen Huang, the celebrated prime minister of China during tbe minority of Tung Cblb in the early sixties, often said: "You are all too anxious to awake us and start us on a new road, and you will do it; but you will all regret It, for, once awaking and started, we shall go fast and far farther than you think much farther than you want" Tbe Chinese seem to be waking and when they become thoroughly aroused they may well be reckoned as a factor in the world's affairs. It will not then be a question of whether China Is to be partitioned, but bow to keep China from overrunning others. H1H 

KATE. Tbe Honorable George Robertson of Mexico is one of those simon-pure democrats who could not follow bis party in It fight for principle and went off after Mark Haanaiam. Ml. Bobertsoa Is a attorney and has for many yean been tbe local' attorney ol the Wabash and C. A. systems and now out of job. Ue tell in the Mexico Ledger why be is out, and in view of tbe fact that it is only the logi cal sequence of the principles be has been advocating for four years, we sup pose be Is well pleased with tbe result. My relation with both companies have always been very pleasant and I nave taken great interest in this par ticular kind of professional work. The railroads are now concentrating every thing so far aa possible In tbe cities, nnder one bead, and the place of local attorney in tbe country Is becoming one of such subordination, that a law yer witb any ambition io his profession, cannot afford to continue in it. Cor poration law, in many of it branches, has become a special business rather than a profession and a great deal in one line of work may be done by s single man at a minimum expense. Tbe expense has become the great matter of consideration and, except in the highest places, qualification I not tbe controlling factor." Tbe Prohibition Vote. Editor lnlelllfeucer, You are conducting a paper in tbe interest of the democratic party, but I hope you may not consider it Incon sistent with that calling to publish, for the benefit of "whom it may concern," tbe following as to tbe prohibition vote: USA woo Lafayette County U GO Mlasoerl 2,0 6,963 le Us United Bute. 132,000 25,000 In nearl; every state the vote has) been doubled over that of four years ago, and that is the face of a very bit ter contest between tbe two old parties. Prohibitionists are greatly encouraged and by the next general election expect to see great numbers of good men who are now indifferent on this subject, speaking through tbe ballot box for the destruction of the legalited saloon, and regarding the whole a) stem as Im moral, lawless and anti-Christian.
