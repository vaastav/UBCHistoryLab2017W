At the meeting in th' evening Judge Jewett wan introduced by a committee that bad been sent to wait on him, and desire from him any communication he might have to make, of his willingness to aid the new enterprise. ' Fresh from the purchase of iron works at 1000,000, and a railiHtad ai a million, the broad shouldered, ratlr r corpulent, full f.iced and massive bended President of the Pan-handle breathed rather heavily, and rubl'ed his head wearily, as he took the chair set for him; and, in response to some kindly inquiries, confessed that he was growing old and fleshy. The subject that had' brought them to gether was then introduced by the gentle men pres lit, and Judge Jewett listened to their statements as to the prospects of the enterprise, and the hope they bad that he would foster it for a feeder -of the roads in which he is interested.

I THE 

PROPOSED NEW ROAD. This enterprise was tirst projected six teen years since, by the New York and Krie -Rath-ond, for a Southern connection. They made a survey throiiftli the eastern counties to Maysviilc, and lingered over it about a year, but that was the end of that. The matter was dropped, and was not Ruitated until last spring, when a few persons, listening to the suggestion of the Pan-handle (Pennsylvania.) C'oiup my, that, if the people would build the road- j bed from, say Dresden to Maysville, they j would lay the iion, equip the road, build . the bridge over the Ohio at Maysville, and 1 thus sceure the northern connection. :Tliis j company now owns west to Newark from Philadi lphia; tiiey nlso have control from llllllllll'IW IO ' UllflllllBll, HIM HIP USB Ol Hie gap from Newark to Columbas. j 111 accordance with the suggestions above mentioned, meetings were held of people I of Brown, Highland mid Fayelte Counties, at Circleville, in July lust, the result of which was the appointment of committees ' of those counties ! to have a survey made, j Mr. J. (Jore, of Adams County, was ap- pointed to make the survey, which work lie commenced on the lllth of August, at Aberdeen, opposite XIa3-ville, on the Ohio River, sixty-four miles ahove this city. Mr. Gore carried the survey from Aber deen;0 west of north to liipley eijrht miles; thence via Rusliville, Fincastle and New Market lo Hillwboro, about thirty five miles 18 enst of north; thence by Ieesburo; to Washincton, the capital of Fayette Comity, twenty-four miles, in about the same course, or. perhaps. 2 or more of a deflection from due north. j As our readers know. Washington is on the Cincinnati, Y ilminuton and Zanes- vilie Hailrnad, which fact is siKniricant, and accounts for.the inemion of another interest in this article. From Washing- urvoy takes la Uloominburg, ii mi i 1 1 ii ,T"ni,iinhMiJi.Tij3WiM'JI" "fi'mrm Mount Sterling, Palestine and Harrisburg to Columbus, .-thirty-seven and a half miles, making a total of one hundred and seven mi:es from Aberdeen to Columbus The alignment of the road has the merit of great directness, almost an air-liue,as fol lows ; The maximum grade is fifty feet to the mile, which is necessary in order to reach the table bind. From Aberdeen to Ripley it is very direct; from Ripley, through the Ripley basin to the table-land, about eight miles, seven miles of which has a grade of fifty feet to the mile, overcoming an alti tilde of three hundred and fifty feet, it is quite circuitous. . Thence, four - miles to Kussellsville, on an air line; thence to Fiu castle, nine and a half miles, is an air line, through a generally even, though slightly undulating country, encountering a Ringle instance of extraordinary expense, say one mile, at Eagle Creek; thence, to within two and a half miles of New Market, is an airline of sevcu miles, with only surface grading; thence to the crossing of the Hillsboro Railroad, n mile and a quarter west of Hillsboro, the graduation will be rather expensive, with rather heavy cuts and fills. Thence to Hillsboro one and a quarter miles alongside of the Hillsboro and Cincinnati road, the cost will be slight. From Hill -.boro to the table-land north of Clear Creek, about four aodl a half miles, the road will be expensive with its graduation and masonry. These table-binds reached, there is an air line ol rive miles to lesburg. with only surface grading. From Leesburg, crossing Lee's Creek, and for a distance of a mile and a half, heavy expense will be required. The creek lies one hundred feet below the table-land. Tii'e table-land ' having been reached ae-afh, there is an air line of thir teen miles to Washington, . with surface griding throughout save at the crossings of Rattlesnake and Sugar Creeks, where there will bo additional expense, but not very heavy. At Washington, the road will connect with, and crass the Circinna ti. Wilmington and Zanesville Railroad, sixty-nine and one half miles fiom Aber deen. Thence is continued the airline to Blooininglinrg, live and one half miles, through a level, even country, with sim ply snrfiice gra-dimr. crossing Paint Creek, say a. milesouth of Bloomingburg. Thence by an air line the. road will run, deflecting 20 to the east, by Mount Sterling and Palestine, to Harrisburg, ' a distance ol nineteen miles. Thence the d"flection Is seveii degrees west for 6,000 feet across Darby Creek. : For three miles here the cost of the road will be heavy. Having crossed Darby Creek and reached the table-land there is an air line of . fourteen miles to Columbus, in the same course as that to Harrisburg, connecting with the Hocking Valley road. 1.300 leet north of Ihelr eastern bridge over the Scioto. GENERAL IDEAS. A portion of the general plan Is to con nect with the Hocking Valley Railroad. of the best coal-liulds in Ohio; and to con tinue, by an arrangement with them, if possible, around to the Columbus and Cleveland depot. The iiMst prominent local advantage to be derived from this enterprise, is to ac commodate the grain and stock" business of these counties. There will thus be af forded a new' opening to the Eastern mar ket. It is a rich "country, and it wants a market to develope its resources. All of these counties are very productive of grain, and feed a large amount of cattle and hogs. It is as good a corn country as can be found in the State. This also gives these counties access to coal, of which they have been in need. They pay to-day, live cents more per bush el than is charged in the Cincinnati mar ket. Should this road be built it will stand as a'norlh and south line lor connection by way bf Maysville and Lexington, with the Soul hern States. GENERAL IDEAS. For the Newn.

Adjourned. . CHAMBERS BAIRD Chra'n. W. R. Smith, Sec'y. ! Chilltcothe & Maysville R.R. The prospects of this enterprise are not particularly brilliant just now, judging from the tone of the Chilli- cothe papers. The old fogies of the ... . ,. r Ancient metropolis, it appears, reruse to come down with the needful. Hear the Advertiser pitch into them: A Mistake. The Portsmouth Trih'ine imagines that the reason the old Fus.-tilizcd Cap italists of Chill icot he refuse to assist the O &. S. Railroad is that they pre fer the route down the valley. All a mistake. With them, it is simply a matter of squeezing their funds and making .them produce a certain per cent. They don't take, risks. They have enough for themselves and chil dren, and don't care a curse for the struggling barbarians. They would not take stock in a railroad to Heaven, with the tender of a free pass and wel come admission when they get there, if you couldn't insure them twenty per cl-nt. cash on the capital invested. With aslight alteration Watts' hymn is our only consolation: . - "Tlmy ennaot live alwayf Ak ut tliHt they nay." Perhaps the true reason why your "old fossils" hang back, brother Put nam, is because they have discovered the fact, which is :iiow apparent to everybody else, that there is no chance for your road, since our Maysville & Columbus short line has been started. You may as well give up the contest and save further trouble. The Bright Side for December is received and is brighter than ever. It is thoroughly imbued with- a childish Cheerfulness, which makes it very pleasant as well as profitable to look at. We do not wonder it is attaining such popularity. Its merits, as well as its price, ought to niakeit popular. AhsX)NLed- M.
