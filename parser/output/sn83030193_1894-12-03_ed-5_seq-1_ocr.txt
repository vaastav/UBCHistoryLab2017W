At the threshold of such labor ttow to bo undertaken by the Congress tK.the United States, and in the dla JShirB of an executive duty enjoined by $! Constitution, I submit this communi dCatlao, containing a brief statement of She .condition of our National affairs, find recommending such legislation as citterns to me necessary and expedient. JftTha history of our recent dealli.gs with JjpU'.er nations, and our peaceful relations teWith them at this time, additionally dem onstrate the advantage of consistently Jadhsring to a Ann but just foreign pol ucy, free from envious or ambitious Na tional schemes and characterized by en l lira honesty and sincerity. y r During the past year, pursuant to a 'Y law ot Congress, commissioners were v appointed to tha Antwerp Industrial XV-j Exposition. Though the participation i WC of American exhibitors fell far short of I (r completely illustrating our National In jrnL, genulty and industrial achievements, yet IpJ It was quite creditable In view of the UL p. brief, time allowed for preparation. Vkk have endeavored to Impress upon MM tha Belgian Government the needless-IR- ness and positive harmfulness of its W 9b restrictions upon the importation of cer- ''Ht tain of our food products, and have I ;-Bf; strongly urged that the rigid supervision I B d inspection under our laws are amply Ii HJ sufficient to prevent the exportation 1 m from this country of diseased cattle and 1 7MS unwholesome meat. A serious tension of relations having HP arisen at the close of the war between Brazil and Portugal, by reason of the 1 law escape of tbe Insurgent Admiral da Mt, Gtuna and bis followers, the friendly na onlces of our representatives to those KHHcountries were exerted for the protec SKf tlon of tha subjects of either within HHSr the territory of the other. IftmaW Although the Government of Brazil HBPfr ra duly notified that the commercial J; arrangement existing between the 1B United States and that country, based fBK on tha third section of the Tariff act Vof 1880, was abrogated on Aug. 28. 1KM. EBB or tha t'Alng effect of the Tariff law ElB now in force, that Government subse kquently notified us of Its Intention to .Vitannlnate such arrangement on the first fBV d5y of January, 1893, In thu exercise of BH the right reserved In the ugreement TKC between the two countries. I invite BHft attention to the correspondence between mW tbe Beoretary of Stats and the Brazilian If Br Minister on tbla subject.

I BBtT ' f 1. 0, HAVEMEYER TALKS OUT. a He Says Some Bharp Things About the President's Message. Tho Sugar Trust Has Got to Have Protection night Along. The President's message was In the hands of tho Sugar Trust officials long before Its publication In the afternoon papers. When an "Evening World" reporter saw the secretary, John E. Eearles, at the offices, 117 Wall, street, the latter was visibly excited. He had Juet come from a conference with Theodore A. and H. q. Havemejer. "You must see Mr. Havemeyer cither of them will do," he said. "I have noth ing to say concerning the President's message." President 11. O. Havemeyer, of the American Sugar Kenning Company, this afternoon gave out the following signed statement: "If any one will fairly and dispassion ately consider the President's recommen dation about sugar, it will become ap parent that It comes down to this: The Sugar Company has taken action, the re sult of which Is to deprive temporary of work 25,000 persons employed In tbe vari ous Industries dependent upon the refin ing of sugar, together with the members of their families. I recommend such ac tion as to deprive those persons of work permanently. If the Industry is lan guishing, the proper course Is to destroy "There are some things which can be established through a demonstration. A comparison of the duty put by the tariff bill upon various articles will show that while the maximum protec tion accorded to sugar Is S per cent., other and more favored articles receive protection up to 40 per cent and CO per cent. "Why this discrimination should be made against a large number of persons who hold the stock In the Company and are employed In Its rennerles. It Is im possible to say. They protest against It. The answer to this protest In the President's message la that, as the present protection Is Inadequate, It ought to be removed altogether. Iteasonable legislative'1 aid requires that the sugar Industry shall be treated as other Important Industries. If this a done the Industry need not languish and "thousands of discharged workmen" will havf. remunerative employment. "The country has already pronounced Its Judgment upon the mode In which the last Congress dealt with the Inter ests of workingmen. The President ap parently has not learned the lesson. It ought not to require much time for work men to appreciate that the President In a bid for personal popularity Is willing to strike a death b'.ow at their Interests. "H. O. 

HAVEMEYER." Isaac Sellgman, of the firm of J. Si W. Sellgman & Co., brokers, 21 Broad street, said: "President Cleveland's attitude on the drain on our gold reserve. Us cause and remedy, is perfectly sound. His remarks On the lack of elasticity In our currency circulation and Its 'freq'uent concentra tion In financial circles, when It Is most needed In other parts of the coun try, are equally sound. "I believe that Congress should promptly authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a gold bond, say a 3-per-cent. bond. This would relieve the drain upon our gold reserve and make solid our credit" Henry Clews said: ," The President's message Is of com paratively little Importance. It will have but little effect upon legislation during the present short session of Congress, as under the peculiar clrcmumstances, the measures that may be Introduced will be Inspired by members of Congress and not by the Executive. " No pop-gun legislation, or other dis turbing measures can possibly become law during this term of Congress." "If they are Introduced they will be killed by being talked to death. It Is for that reason business people are no longer scared by threats of object les sons, or any other similar Intimidations. Hereafter business men wUl have a voice In National legislation, which will take away the monopoly power exercised during last session by the politicians. This Is as it should be, for the country's good." Washington E. Connor: "I have only read a, digest of the President's message that camo In on the tape. I may say, however, that the general feeling on the street Is. that the President Is sound In his views, without regard to party. Republicans and Dem ocrats alike, have great faith in his financial policy."

"It only shows to what an astonishing extent fraud can go under what Is popu larly believed to be a good government. "I have never known of such a sys tem of corruption tn London, and do not think It could exist for even a snort time. As we say over there. 'We manage such things- better tn England.' "Of course. I heard but a few wit nesses, and It may be but one side of the case; but 1 never conceived even surh allegtlons of corruption possible." Mr. Burns spoke of Mr. Goff aa "a brilliant man and one of the very best crnrK-examlnera he had ever heard." Mr. Je-nme. who haa been SJ much en gaged with the affair of the LXX. that he could not attend tha hearings before election, was In his old place again.

"We shall certainly sit as many days as we can get together during the month and so tur as 1 know, the Investigation will continue on the lines which have uready been taken up," said he. "1 do not know exactly what plans Mr, Goff has for our opening hearing, but I think tnoro testimony will be received on the qutstlon of pollco protection to dls oiderly housea." A number of flashily dressed women had come In mean time, and had been escorted to scats In the witnesses' corner by Sergeatit-at-Arms Scliram, which gave ground for the Chairman's supposition. A large number of policemen In uniform wore also on Imntl, but no prominent of ficials of I he Department had appeared.
