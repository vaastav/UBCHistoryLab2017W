He has arranged with Kiee -it Perkins for about tluOO pho tographs, cabinet size, of all the play ers in the eompany. Beginning with this evening- every lady patron of the tin -a i er will be given a coupon enti tling tlie holder to one photograph. The coupons wiil be given as each lady en ters the theater, after tickets are pre sented. As there are about fifteen members of the company, an excellent oppor tunity is given to the ladies of Hono lulu to acmire a full set of these pho tographs. There are many handsome- looking men and some particularly Hid the trustees ot possibility whii-h the President s IK-tits for Hawaii Irom onress, should i delegation of workers to to Washington by trie next sie.imei. Tin- interests at stake are too great to he left, as resets ways and means f,f dealing with them, to the derision of one man, even Mr. Hatch. Findino that the question of whether a delegation shall he sent or not is m to him, Mr. Haf-h may very easily ,-on.lude that a dilieren.-t- of opinion exists anion his employers "and that it would be better for him. if he errs at all, to do it on the side of economy. Furthermore, a man who is employed to represent our public bodies before Cou-ress, as Mr. Hal eh is, would naturally be loath to admit that he needed help when his employers, knowing all the circumstances, had discussed the matter and come to no conclusion. Upon the question of courtesy to Mr. Hat.-h we Lave but one opinion. "When he was Hawaiian Minister at Washing on. our people sent on delega tion after delegation to aid him. Other Hawaiian envoys were similarly helped, i v,.r.. the,, dit.lo'iiats offended, nor was the service misconstrued. Instead they welcomed every material evidence from home that their positions striking; women in the Buhler company were beim' backed up by their constituents.

New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California all the States and sll the mainland Territories send representative men to Washington to aid any great Congressional measure which may be vital to them. Xo question of courtesy is raised or thought of and the need' of massing all the influence pos sible before Congress is conceded as a matter of course. The suggestion that the President, having commended certain things in the interests of Hawaii, will see that the Territory gets them from Congress, would , be strange indeed, coming from an American. From gentlemen of foreign birth ! and nationality or of foreign leading, it is excusable, but it would not be ex- j cusable for an American community to accept such advice. We do things j somewhat differently at Washington than is done abroad. In Europe a "gov- j eminent" may control the legislative branch, the two kinds of authority act ing as a unit. In America the executive and legislative branches have no such definite cohesion. Often the President may get what he wants from a Congress of his political faith, especially it his request is backed by the party platform, but he has no way to command it. The adverse fate of Mr. Koos- evelt's much-prized reciprocity treaties is an example in point. e know of these photographs will make a nice souvenir of the Buhler Company's visit to Honolulu. hgleTTectIew officers fob year The following officers -were elected by Honolulu Aerie 140.

The President likes those who help themselves. He has too much to do in connection with the affairs of a world power, to shoulder the fight of small localities for appropriations, nor is he likely to appreciate the -public spirit which asks him to do so. Recurring to Mr. Hatch, this paper would like the opinion of the gentle- j men who carried on the debate yesterday, as to how he will be able to reach ninety senators and 357 representatives, 417 legislators in all, with the argu- j ments needed to convince them that Hawaii should have a rebate-of -tariff priv- J ilege never before given to any other part of the Union, and why', if such ; Chas.
