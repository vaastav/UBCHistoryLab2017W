WELCOME HOME JOURNAL. Assuming that the Minneapolis Journal meant what it saidand we do not question but that it did when in a recent issue it declared it would join in the extra session de mand if proof were produced to show that the senate would pass a reap portionment bill assuming this, the Pioneer welcomes the Journal back into the reapportionment fold, for the Pioneer feels that it has the proof. We quote the following editorial expression from the Journal: The Bemidji Pioneer claims to know of more than four State Senators who would change their votes on reapportionment, and adds that they are under pledges signed in mk. But the Pioneer carefully conceals the names of these Senators who have changed their minds since the last session The Journal is not opposed to an extra session ot the legisla ture, if it can be shown in ad vance that a fair reapportion ment bill will be passed. If the Pioneer or anyone else can come forward with the proof that enough Senators have pledged themsel\es to join with the re apportionment forces to put the bill through, The Journal will gladly support the extra session proposal. But so far not a single Senator has thus declared him self. Of course, practically every member of the Senate would promise to vote for "a fair reap portionment bill," if the defini tion of what such a bill provides is left to him. Such promises are worthless. There were many such that were broken under one pretext or another in the last session. What is necessary is the written pledges of a majority of the Senate to a definite and well understood scheme of reap portionment. To go into an ex tra session with anything less than that would be futile. From time to time The Daily Pio neer has printed expressions from southern senators indicating beyond doubt their determinationseven senator or no seven senator amend mentto vote for a reapportionment bill as provided for by the state con stitution. In this issue we call the Journal's particular attention to the attitude of Senator A. J. Rockne. \'d The Journal understands the pow er Senator Rockne wields. The Journal knows he was at one time speaker of the House and that today he is one of the strongest men in the senate. Senator Rockne not only say#: "If an extra session is called I will vote for a fair reapportionment bill," but he lets the public cleai'ly understand what he means by a "fair" bill. "I drew the so-called Hanson bill," he says. This measure gave practically ev ery county in the state a representa tive. It was drawn in accordance with the constitution. That is what the senators mean when they say they are in favor of a "fair" bill, judging from those who have writ ten the Pioneer, and this number is large enough to swing the balance. Tomorrow, on the eve of the North ern Minnesota Development associa tion's convention at St. Cloud, The Daily Pioneer will assemble and pub lish the names of those senators pledged to a fair reapportionment bill at an extra session. It is up to the Journal to make good on its assertion, for it is rea sonably certain that a reapportion ment bill can be passed at an extra session this winter of the Minnesota legislature. Catholic Church in America. Editorial From the Outlook. The Roman Catholic church is not a peril to American institutions, its growth in the United States is not a menace. On the contrary, its deca dence would be a peril, and the ces sation of its labors, if that were con ceivable, would be a menace. It does not, and cannot, minister to the in tellectual and spiritual needs of all the American people but neither could the Protestant churches, nor any one of them, minister adequate ly to the large sections of the Amer ican people who belong to the Roman Catholic church. And its service to the social well-being of America is certainly not overstated in the fol lowing paragraph, which we quote from Cardinal Gibbons: "In her view, labor has rights as well as dignity, and included in these rights is that of organization. So cialism is abhorrent to her teachings and is condemned. She has contend ed always that labor, like every oth er commodity, has a fair price, and that if workingmen received a fair wage under humane conditions of employment, and capital a moderate and reasonabl profit} this grave ques tion would be solved. Opposed to strife, she disapproves boycotts and favors arbitration as a means of set tling labor as well as international disputes. Striving to maintain the home, that unit of a strong nation, she has vigorously condemned di vorce, permitting only that kind of dissolution of the marriage bonds which is known as separation from bed and board." Such a church is not to be met with a mere spirit of tolerance by those who do not accept its dogmas, share in its worship, or acknowledge the authority of its head. It is to be cordially welcomed, not merely be cause its ministers to the higher life of its own members, but also because it is promoting the moral order and the social welfare of the entire com munity.

Mr, Taft Champions the Anti trust Statute. NEW REMEDIES SUGGESTED. Not Repeal or Amendment, but Sup plemental Legislation NeededThe Tobacco Trust Decision an Effective OneFederal Incorporation Recom mended and a Federal Corporation Commission ProposedThe Test of "Reasonableness*" To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: This message is the first of several which 1 shall send to cougresvs during the interval between the opening of lis regular session and its adjourn ment for the Christmas holidays. Tbe amount of information to be commi. nieated as to the operations of the government, tbe number of important subjects calling for comment by the executive and the transmission to con- 5 gress of exhaustive reports of special commissions make it impossible to in clude in one message of a reasonable length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the attention of the national legislature at its first regular session. The Anti-trust LawThe Supreme Court Decisions. In May last the supreme court hand ed down decisions in the suits in equi ty brought by the United States to en join the further maintenance of the Standard Oii trust and of the Ameri can Tobacco trust and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch making and serve to advise the busi ness world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust act of 1890. The decisions do not de part in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court in con struing and applying this important statute, but they clarify those deci sions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal con struction of the act. By the decrees they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to pre serve the benefit, freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. No Change In the Rule of Decision, Merely In Its ForrW of Expression. The statute in its first section de clares to be illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the* sev eral states or with foreign nations" and in the second declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nations." In two early cases, where the statute was invoked to enjoin a transporta tion rate agreement between inter state railroad companies, it was held that it was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonable at common law, be cause it was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and com binations in restraint of trade, whether reasonable at common law or not. It was plain from the record, however, that the contracts complained of In those cases would not have been deem ed reasonable at common law. In sub sequent cases the court said that the statute should be given a reasonable construction and refused to, include within its inhibition certain contrac tual restraints of trade which it de nominated as incidental or as indirect. These cases of restrant of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were instances which at common law would have been call ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil and tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the tests of the com mon law and in defining exceptions to the literal application of the statute only substituted for the test of being incidental or indirect that of being reasonable, and this without varying in the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way if the court had originally accepted in its construction the rule at common law. It has been said that the court by in troducing into the construction of the statute common law distinctions has emasculated it. This is obviously un true. By its judgment every contract and combination in restraint of inter state trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition or of establish ing in whole or in part a monopoly of such trade is condemned by the stat ute. The most extreme critics cannot instance a case that ought to be con demned under the statute which is not brought within its terms as thus con strued The suggestion is also made that the supreme court by its decision in the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade is within the terms of the statute. This Is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law is well understood and Is clearly defined. Tt does not rest in the discretion of the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which in order that it shall be enforceable at all it must be incidental. If it exceed the needs of that contract it is void. The test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at comman law to contracts or combinations or con spiracies in restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to con trol prices or establish monopolies The courts never assumed power to say that such contracts or combina tions or conspiracies might be lawful if the parties to them were only mod erate in the use of the power thus se cured and did not exact from the pub lic too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that many theorists and others engaged in business violating the stat ute have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts, but no court of authority has ever attempted it Certainly there is nothing in the deci sions of the latest two cases from which such a dangerous theory of ju dicial discretion in enforcing this stat ute can derive the slightest sanction Force and Effectiveness of Statute a Matter of Growth. We have been twenty-one years mak ing this statute effective for the pur- po&e fo wc i Knight casnei wasw discouraging and seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the e\ils of the trusts Slowly, howev er, the en or of that judgment was cor rected, and only in the last three or four jeaii, Lias the hea\y hand of the law beeu laid upon the great illegal combinations that ha\e exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our industnes Cumiual prosecutions tune been brought, and a number are pend ing. but janes ha\e telt averse to con victiug foi jail sell fences and judges have been most reluctant to impose such sentences on men of respectable standmg in sotietj whose offense has been regarded as meiely statutory Still, as the otfeuse becomes better un derstoud and the committing of it par takes more of studied and deliberate detiauce of the law we can be confi dent that juries will convict individu als and that jail sentences will be im posed The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution.
