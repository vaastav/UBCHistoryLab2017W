A MINISTER'S FALL. His Wife too Unsuspecting of His Shameful Hypocrisy. Pious Meditations with Stepdaughter Which Ended in Her Ruin and His Own Flight From Home. Ft. Rons, Mo., D c'inber fv The pro. pie of Carondelet are terribly iicen-ed ut the doings of the Rev. Jacob Shlit-tler, fis tor f the Ciernian Lutheran Cluircn, w hich have just come to light. Jacob arrived in Carondelet eight years ago and gave out that be was from Chicago. He married n rich widow named Westvrman, and she had n daughter, a handsome young lady just budding into womanhood. Shlituer lor some time, it appears, has hail his wife com pletely i;nderhis control. He built mi or atory in his parlor, and three times a day her daughter was brought in there, where her spiritual adviser and steplather pre tended to be praying with her. Super natural man i testations reduced Mrs. Schlittler to a state ol practical imbecility. Annie lound the paths of goodness pleas ant to walk in, and tor som months every thing went well. In the middle watches of the night Schlittler would arise and call the unfortunate girl to devotions. Her mother would applaud the pair and thank Heaven tor such a husband and such a daughter, A week ago Annie's aunt, a lady named Alstorolf, culled upon the Shlitllers and at once suspected that some thing was wrong. In spite ot herself the girl w as seized by her mother and her aunt and the truth discovered. Finuily, g'tiini; free from her aunt, nhe Htrm k her a blow in the face wuicn sent her reeling over a chair, and, rushing into the front parlor hall clad as she was, she threw herself jnto her father's arms, crying, "Protect me from mother and Aunt AisioroiF!" The two women bil lowed her in, realized tne sit ual ion at once, and the mother tell in a dead faint. 'I he Rev. Jacob, as soon as she was re stored, confessed his crime and begged for giveness. Annie followed, confessing, and asking pardon. The aunt began to denounce and threaten tar and leathers. A scene fol lowed, and the wife took the part ot the erring husband and daughter, and drove her sister from the house. Tho latter smothered her rago nnd held her own counsel until to-day, when she in formed the authorities. Otlicers imme diately set about investigating the matter, and tound that Schlittler and his step daughter had iled the city, Mrs. Schlittler, strange as it may seem, having consented to his taking her daughter to Chicago. To your correspondent she said: 'l have still laith in my husnand's purity. He confessed to me, but said that he must huve com mitted the crime when in a semi-unconscious state. Cod forgives, wtiv should not I? 1 love Annie. 1 love him. He will take good care of Annie. They will come buck all right." She hud just received a letter from her husband, whose departure for Chicago was made last Wednesday. He writes: "Annie is doing as well as could be expected. What do people say about us in Carondelet:-" lie also says that he and Annie are stay tng in Chicag'o with his sis ter, Mrs. Mary licyder, at io. 4." Mohawk street.- The Legislature of Virginia.
