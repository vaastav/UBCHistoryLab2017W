REDUCTION OF TAXATION ThtH who read the presidents message yesterday will notice that he deprecates the steady accnmula tion of surplus revenues More thin this he suggests measures to oiviate snch accumulations rightly deeming a u = ele cash balance an evil rather than a blessing There can be little doubt but congress will heed the presidents suggestions and that during the present session there will be legislation providing for a diminution of revenue taxation Democrats and republicans may not be fully agreed as to the details of = uch legislation but democrat and republicans alike will concede that it is in order and once there is harmony on this point it will not be difficult to unite on the details May we not hope that here in Texas the presidents sagacious suggestions will be repeated Our state government is accumulating ha already accumulated a sura of money wrung from overtaxed peo ple that 1b altogether useles and idle We have a million of dollars rusting in the treasury at Austin that is inapplicable to any constitu tional requirement It cannot be returned to the people who paid it nor can it be applied to the reduc tion of the states bonded indebted ness save at extravagant rates The experiment ou ht to satisfy those who are iu power The democratic party ought to present some better policy than piling up hundreds ofthousands of useless money and that too without reducing taxation It is true theadvalorem tax has been dimmihed but onerous occupation taxe till exist There is a remedy and if Governor Koberts has true moral courage he will a sc the legi Uture to apply the remedy It is to ubmit constitutional amend ments to popular vote providing for a repeal ot that article iu he organic law making the rate of county and local taxation
