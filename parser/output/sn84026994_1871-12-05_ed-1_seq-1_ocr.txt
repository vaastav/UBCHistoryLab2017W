Mr. Stanberry, for the defence, ? moved to quash the indictment against Cros? by and others. The grounds of the motion were: That the name of the person injured was not mentioned la the indictment; that only three of the qualifications of a voter were named; that the grand jury had come to a concludion as to the law, Instead of as to the facts; that voters received their qualifica? tions under the State laws only; that the In? dictment was defective In stiling the deprivation of the right to vote as taging place at a future date; that the United States Constitution and laws do not secure to any .Citizen the right to vote; that the bnrglary counSf la the Indictment was defective as being stated to be against the "dignity of I the State of South Carolina." instead of J against the "dignity of the United States;" that the fifteenth constitutional amend? ment does not secure to colored persons the right to vote except as subject to the State laws; that the Indictment ls not specific In stating mere intimidation; that the State Courts and not the United States Courts must redress personal grievances, such as security -from search, Aa; that lt was not shown In ^tae indictment that A.

OUR FINANCIAL MUDDIK What a Vow Torie Business Journal Thinks of the Finances of South Caro? lina-The Report of the Citizen'? Com? mittee. - .[From the New York Bulletin.] We eh&ll not venture to prejudge the ac? counts of the financial agent, bat that he should control such an enormous amount of bonds, and that nothing should be known at the State treasury respecting the nature of J his operations, the condition of his accounts, or the extent to which he has involved the credit of the State, Is a matter which, to say the least, demands the promptest remedy. Mr. Ktmpton's promised statement should not be delayed one day, nor do we see why it need be; and lt is due to himself that he snould In? vite, at once, a lull examination of bis account a by parties who would coniktand public confidence. The pub? lic very properly ask, how ls lt that | the State authorities know, or profess to know, so little ol the operations or the New York agency, when all the debt operations have been conducted through it? There ls either gross neglect or something worse In this apparent Ignorance; and the public can. only be expected to discredit the State officials until the mystery is cleared up and everything told. If people distrust the government, and, as Governor Scott complains, the press has protested and the people have begun to mut? ter the foul word "repudiation,'* what wonder, when the most extraordinary Irregularities are v.rapt up In profound secrecy ? Until the Governor gives the public a full and fair statement of everything, ne can only expect to be distrusted, and all who hold positions of financial trust under him. . ?.*.* # # t We understand that the citizens' committee was unable to Balls fy itself of the incorrect? ness of a report current here that bonds re? ceived for redemption, or In the way of con? versions, have been used SA collateral for loans. Respecting the $300,000 held In the sinking fund (also deducted from said state? ment ot the debt,) the report makes a darkly suggestive remark. . ? * * * . . . Tbue the committee suggest a grave doubt that not only has the sulking fund been divert? ed from Its proper use, but that retired bonds have been reissued. What have the State officials to say to these Imputations* How long do they suppose the bondholders and tax? payers will keep their patience under the dark suspicions thus Inevitably suggested ' Their reticence ls naturally construed aa an evidence of guilt; and yet Governor Scott, lu an official bulletin, assumes an slr of injured virtue ! The committee deserve thanks for what they have done; bnt some explanation ta required of the reaaona which prevented them from ex tending their examinations to the office of the financial agent, where only they could expect to find the information about which the public ?UM most concerned. -The Chicago Journal considers the de? struction of about a cart-load of " original poetry" in lu office-as the most gratifying fea? ture of the fire. THE SCHOOL FRAUDS. A Last Word from Kx-School Commlf sloner Emery. COOPER KITER, December 2. TO THE EDITOR OP THE NEWS. Sir-I must beg again, and for the last time, to be heard through your columns in reply to Mr. E. Montague Grimke's communication of yesterday. He says that if I will establish the truth of my assertions through any three unprejudiced citizens of this community he will be among the first to acknowledge my innocence. In? deed! It is generally believed to be a maxim of law that one ls Innocent till proved guilty. When he can establish the truth of A ts asser? tion I will be among the first to acknowledge that he is not a calumniator. He calls upon me, if innocent, to unite with him in fixing the guilt. Why did he net ex? tend this invitation before rushing into print to asperse me? I have met him frequently in conversation, but never a woid of explana? tion did he ask. In my previous communication I. clearly explained my connection with the school? house transaction-that it was confined exclu? sively to approving an order which I believed at the time to be just, and to receiving for the same through the board of trustees, .wno drew the order, what I supposed, to be the voucher of the person in whose name lt was drawn. I took the official word of that board, and he the word of I's successor. I *do not lind that he ever went to examine for himself, nor did I go. If he, In his perturbed yet magnani? mous soul, cannot allow me average honesty, can he not at lea?t acquit me of the Imputa? tion of stupidity ? If he bestows upon the re? cords of the office but a lithe of the time he has devoted to my disparagement, he can very easily ascertain whence came the irreg? ularities. Mr. Grimke's only conception of hts sworn duties seems to have .been not to organize schools and look after their welfare, out to Ery into my conduct, and subject me, if pos'i le, to reproach. His chief business during the past year, according to his own sho winer, has been to put to every teacher entering his office the question, "Did Mr. Emery offer to purchase your claim ?" and from but one did he receive a negative answer. How unfor? tunate to have missed that one ! . I have already stated how aud under what circumstances 1 took the' certificates of those who were in my debt, and refused the certifi? cate? of those who were not, and, in view of the fact that Mr. Grtmke, in his peculiarly bland manner, had informed me that he would establish no schools issue no books, nor be responsible for any acts of mine, I ask in common fairness how else could I have done to protect m ya ell f Why such spite ? Was be shut out from prospective profits ? Every book and document properly belong? ing to toe office I turned over to Mr. Qrimke. That which contained my book accounts with the State and the teachers was my own pri? vate properly, bought with my own money, and was in no way essential to a proper knowl? edge or performance of his duties. In retain? ing my own private property, involving as it did my own personal liability, which did not cease on my retirement from office, I did nothing different from what every accounllng official always does. If he is perplexed at not knowing what he has no right to know, let bim condole himself with the reflection that ?cry - probably be ls not the only sufferer In th's world from a morbid curiosity. Mr. Grtmke in his private business may treat bis customers with perfect sat? isfaction to them, but some busy-body next door, actuated by. " proscriptive . venom, " or perchance the deBlre to demonstrate to the ruin of Broad street brokers the prac? ticability of the hitherto Impossible lest of "ealing one's cake and yet having it," im? pugns his integrity and demand? his books. What answer, I ask. would he give to such impertinence ? Touts, ic. MOULTON EMEUT. . THE PASSIVE POLICY. Letter from John (lainey Adams Warm? ly Approving lt. The Hon. John Quincy Adams, of Massa? chusetts, has written a letter to the Missouri Republican, warmly approving tile so-called passive policy of the Democrats in the next Presidential election. In the course of the letter Mr. Adams says: I am satisfied such a course will be wise and patriotic, and should be glad to see the Dem? ocracy concur In such resolution. I regard the present administration as a national calamity, and Its continuance should be avert ed at any sacrifice, not because Republican in politics, but because lt ls mean in character, sordid in tone, and ignorant,. corrupt ano arbitrary; because more than any administra? tion we nave had, lt has disappointed the hopes and deade:.el the generous aspirations of the good men of all pa* ties; because lt ls doing more to permanently disunite'the Stales than the government of Jefferson Davis ever did; because Us chief conceives there ls no means for a free government but military loree; no public action but private ;.rofit. Font years more of such education, family Eat mnage, and martial .law, will so blunt the een sensibilities of popular .liberty that our Ignoble incubus might well remain a fixture. Mow, I believe the Democratic party to be powerless alone to relieve us, and I think lt ls wAbout hope of carrying the next election. No doubt ii the votes ol any States lately In re? bellion were necessary to elect a Democratic candidate, they would be thrown out in the counting. A mere majority, even could lt be mustered, would not he permitted to elect a Democrat tor next President. Nothing then remains but civil war or submission to the usurper, and it ls difficult to decide which al? ternan ve will inflict the moro irreparable In Jury upon the habit of free government. To dismiss an Incompetent official, and avoid a governmental crisis, the Missouri policy offers the only reasonable possibility which bas been presented; but while I frankly avow a partiali? ty for the object, I do not blink the very seri? ous obstacles to ita adoption. We must sub? due the pride of party and break the bonds of party discipline. There are' few more - obstinate passions than the sentimental devotion which men offer to the vague abstraction, party glory; not many creed', Including theology, which are as des? potic as ''pla' form." ' lt will be a difficult task to bring a party, yet glowing with recollec? tions or a mighty past, and but now burning with anticipations of a great future, to yield the head of the column and the command of the field to allies who were but yesterday ene? mies. Nor ls there any strong guarantee that these allies will not flinch at the last. Party leaders are seldom famous for high moral courage which can abide unshaken the stern pressure that forbids a rupture of party ties: but If they dare fling down the gauntlet-duel to death with the Pr?sident, it might be possi? ble for the Democracy to rise to the height, where humiliation of a pan i-an is '.ost IQ the satisfaction of a patriot. But lt Is charged that a sacrifice will be In vain or worse still-it will surrender the whole scheme of Democratic - liberty, bare and bound, to Its enemies. I do not so forebode the event, and can? not believe that a protest against a Dicta? torial government can be weakened by Joining with a band which deseriB lt because li ls hos? tile to civil liberty, and which will compel the enemies to corruption In office to disband, be? cause they unite with those who have sick? ened and turned away from the sight of cor* ruption. Can friends of the constitution pre? serve or protect it more strenuously than by refusing to hold up their hands, who nave for? saken their own friends rather than deface lt further. It seems to me on the contrary that the strength of the support which this move? ment would bring to the rescue ot the princi? ples of Democracy would be in exact propor? tion to the severity of the blow to the pride of the Democratic party; tor these principles must be dear Indeed to men wno can abandon for them an ancient and honored name, and not less precious to those who dare follow them even through the scorn, contempt and obloquy which await political treason.

Lan? sing, Cox, Beck, Van Trump, Waddell. Robin sou and Hanks. Mississippi Levees-Morey, Waldron, McKee, Gentry and Duke. A call of the roll showed that two hundred and one members were present. Beck offered a resolution asking the President certain ques? tions regarding the execution of the Ku-Kiu:: law, which, meeting with a storm ot objec? tions, was referred to the committee' on the Insurrectionary States. Conner and Hancock, of Texas, were sworn In. The other Texas credentials were re fused. In the Senate, Blair offered a resolution of inquiry the same as Beck offered In the House regarding the enforcement of the Ku-Kiux law, which went over under objection. The message was read, and the Senate adjourmd. The President'* Message. In his message the Preeldent slates that the relations of the United Slates with foreign powers continue friendly. He refers to the settlement of the Alabama dispute by the Tr-at y of Washington, and says that the ex? ample thus set may be followed by other elvi - Ized nations, and, finally, be the means of re? turning to productive Industry millions' of men who are now retained to settle national disputes by the bayonet and broadside. He commends the United Slates minister and consul at France for their course In protect? ing the Interests or German subjects In Paris during tba war. He informs Congress that, in conformity with the established precedent, he has recognised the change of government la Rome and the < Italian States. He speaks ot the continued, .friendly rela? tions between Russia and the United States; referring to the visit of the Grand Duke Alexis, and to the hospitable reception elven to him. In relation io Mr. Catacazy, the Preeldent says that the Inexcusable course of the Russian minister had rendered lt neces? sary tor the President to ask that minister's recall, and to decline to receive that function? ary, any longer. He says that lt was impossi? ble tor'hlm, with self-respect or with a Just re? gard to the dignity of the Dallon, to pei mit Mr. Catacazy lo continue to hold intercourse with this government, after bis personal abuse of government officials, and after hia improper Interference, by various means, in the rela? tions between this country and other powers. The. government had, therefore, been released from further Intercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and another minister had been com? missioned who was entirely unobjec? tionable. He recommends the education ot four American youths In China, and he gives the history of the difficulty In the Corea, and leaves the subject to the action of Con? gress. As to Coban affairs, he says that he bas Instructed the American naval commandera lo Cuban waters to protect the lives and liberties of bona fide citizens or the United States, and the dignity of the flag, and expresses the hope that all pending questions between the United States and Cuba may be adjusted, and the spirit of peace and conciliation which bas here? tofore guided both powers. He recommends Congress to take measures to support the lines of steamships between San Francisco and Cnlna and San Francisco and Japan; also, to take steps to bring about a return to specie payments; also, to unite the telegraphic sys? tem'with the postal system ot the United States. He defends the' policy pursued In reference to the stoppage of Ku-Klux outrages, and expresses the belief that, out of the vei y numerous arrests made, no Innocent person ls now in custody. In regard to po? lygamy in Utah, he relates the action of the Federal Courts and authorities there, and says that the Mormons will not be permitted to violate the laws auder the cloak of religion; but suggests whether children already born under the Mormon- system shall not be legiti? matized. He recommends the abol li ion of all In? ternal revenue laxes, except those on spirits, malt liquors, tobacco and stamps; also the revi? sion of the tarin*. He says that ihe Indian peace policy has, thus far, reeulted favorably, and he recommends the lormatlon of a territorial government in the Indian Territory. He sug? gests the removal of all political disabilities, under the fourteenth constitutional amend? ment, and says that it will be a happy time fur the fcoutbern States when their old citizens shall again take an interest in public affairs. He recommends a liberal appropriaiii>n for the District of Columbia and for public build? ings In Chicago. He reviews the question of civil service reform, and promises that the experiment ot reform shall have a lair trial. A 

HORRIBLE MURDER. [From the Uorry Rews.] On Thursday evening of the 9th instant, be? tween sunset and dark, as Jim Sessions (a col? ored man) was pasing the field ot the widow Cooper's, one mlle from this place, to Moses, Moore's, some person who was secreted In a pond near the path shot him. The unfortu? nate man was blt with thirteen shot, entering his right Bide and shoulder. On the night of the lyn- be died. A jury Of Inquest was held by Trial Justice Johnson, acting coroner. From circumstantial evidence before the Jury they rendered a verdict that the deceased came to his death by gunshot wounds, in? flicted by one Mack Burroughs, a colored man. Mack has been arrested and ls now In Jail. Jim was an innocent, Inoffensive negro; so harmless that he would not kill a bunch of flourishing crabgrass if he could help lt. THE MASSACRE AX HAVANA. HAVANA, December 3. Aleltereays the only desecration ol Caste non's grave consisted ia breaking a glass vase covering a niche, removing the Immortelles and substituting wreaths of garlic. For this eight students were shot and eleven sentenced to six years In the chain gang, and nineteen to four years la the chain gang and four to six months' imprisonment. The college instruc? tors asserted it was a mere frolic, but the vol? unteers ruled the hour and raided the s'reels all day. shooting eight Cubans. The condemn? ed students were not allowed an hour's re? spite to see their friends. Those executed were mere boys. The parents offered large Bums to save them-the father of one offering a million, but all In vain. Valmaseda was ab? sent at the time, but fully sanctioned the exe? cutions upon his return. THE OLD WORLD'S NEWS. LoNDoy, December 3. The Prince of Wales passed Sunday quietly, and the symptoms continue favorable.

There was a fire at Warwick Castle last night, which did irreparable damage to the great hail; the dining and other rooms being also gutted.

[Prom the Toledo (Ohio) Times.] In view of the attention which is being di? rected to the tlnancea of the State of South Carolina, it may not be amiss for us of the State of Ohio, the home of R. E. Scott, to say a word. That veracious statesman has bad a great deal to say on Wall street for some days past; and his sayings there have been very well advertised-better, probably, than he ex Ftented. He has also had a word or two to say n Ohio, without the benefit of so great a pub? lishing, and without any desire for IL We dislike, however, io see bis modesty ruin brm, and will do him thu favor of adven Ising an item or two that can do no harm tb anybody else, and may be of great advantage to him. It ls generally understood in this region that Mr. Scott, of Napoleon, Ohio, was not an overly wealthy man when he espoused the cause of the United States "against all foes, foreign or domestic" A careful cyphering, according to the most approved niles of arith? metic, show the reward of that enthusiastic espousal to be about as follows : Two years1 service as brigadier-general United States vol? unteers and chief ot the Freedman's Bureau for South Carolina, at about $3600 per year, $7000; three years' loyal and most valuable service as Governor of the State of South Carolina, at $W)0 per year, $15.000; making a grand total of the reward of loyalty to the extent of $22, 000, which is not too much lor the extraordi? nary loyal services which have been rendered to the government by inls soldier and states? man, and to show that this distinguished son of Ohio ls a financier as well as a states? man, we venture upon the ventilation of a few figures, just to show what prudent use he baa made of the twenty-two thousand above mentioned. Uf course we will pay no attention to I he ordinary expenses of himself and family du? ring this long period, for they are domestic affairs, and are none of our business, except as government money pays for (hem; and we may rest assured that government money, after it came Into Scott's hand', never paid for anything that he could avoid. So we can take lt for granted that our worthy South Carolina Governor, starting out in our great civil war without a penny, did not expend a Eenny during that war, .or the revulsions that ave followed lt, even for the maintenance of bis family. So we give him the advantage ot $22,000, the whole of his pay and emoluments since he began to be a brigadier general, in? cluding all the time that he has furnished dis? cipline for the State of South Carolina. What has he done with tbat $22,000 ? He has been In the State of Ohio since ihe expo? sition in tiie nubile press of the South Carolina bond frauds, and bas lovested bis $22,009 as lollows: He ls building in Napoleon, Ohio, where he expects lo live after bis South Car? olina contract has expired, a $10,000 honse for his Bister. He has taken stock In a new na? tional bank In the City of Toledo to the amount ot nearly Atty per cent, more than his whole pay as an officer of the army and Gov? ernor of South Carolina during the whole time that he bas occupied those positions. A prominent business man and ^capitalist from Canada, well known to capitalists in this vicinity, visited Williams County and other adjoining counties, since Governor Scott was here, tor the purpose -of purchasing timber land with a view of getting out large quanti? ties of ship timber. He found that all the available timber land ot the country round about bad been purchased only a few days previous by Governor Scott. It bas also transpired that, during his visit here, be left In the bands of some of his friends fu'iy $35,000. to be invested in safe real estate. That money ls, to-day, In the hands of business men In this vicinity, awaiting in vestment. And this makes about $100,000 .which Mr Scott, of Napoleon, Ohio, now actina as Gov? ernor of South Carolina, bas invested, within the last two months, In this immediate vlei ul ty, out of the $22,000 which has comprised the whole of his pay and emoluments since be began to be a govrrnment officer. Ttj* paltry sum Of $ IOC.OOO hr bo?-? begaPTTe lb comparison with the $9,000,000 extra fraud on the South Carolina bonds, lt is true. Bnt Gov ernor Scott denies having made anything out of the bonds; and, as far as his Ohio specula tlons are concerned, we give him the benefit of the doubt We will charge aim only the $22,000, which has come to bira In the snape of pay and emoluments-wbicb ls all he claims to nave received-and credit him with the $100,000 he bas saved out of lt to Invest In Oblo, at one pop, within the last month. We would merely suggest that lt isn't fair for one man to bave all the money; and that the Governor, having feathered bis nest, ought to stand aside and give some other loyal man a chance. THE BANK OF THE STATE. Decision of the Sapreme Court. In the Supreme Court In the case of Deb? ney, Morgan A Co. against the president and directors of the Bank of the Slat- of South Carolina, the decision of the court was filed on Saturday. The court decides that the bill bolder3 and the fire loan bondholders- are creditors of the Bank of the State and are en? titled to the assets of thc bank. That the fire loan stockholders are not creditors of the bank, so as to entitle them to a share of the assets. Should thy assets be insufficient to pay the bill hoi Jers and bondholders, then the Siate ls liable for the deficiency. The opinion (according to a correspondent) appears to be well received by the legal profession. THE

Seven Rounds In roar Honrs nod a I Drawn nattle-Hoi h Hen Afraid First Blood Vor M ace-Coburn Repeat? edly Throws Meuse Over the'jKopes Beautiful Sparring bnt no Henry Hitting. Aa already briefly announced in THE NEWS, tbe long expected prize fight between Jem Mace and Joe Coburn came off on Thursday last near New Orleans, and proved but a sorry contest After about four hours' sparring j both men were afraid to decide the result, and j the referee declared the so-called fight a "draw." A letter from New Orleans gives the particulars as follows: ? ??Fal S?j?s There ls a very general disappointment to? night over the result of the Mace and Coburn fight. The Mace men In particular are utterly demoralized, and many Claim the affair was a put-up fraud upon the public from the begin? ning. Sporting men generally speak bitterly against his conduct. The train which started from the city for the fight lng ground consisted of ten passenger coaches, containing some five hundred person-, <Jbe majority of whom were what are termed the better classes, in? cluding representatives of the bench and bar, thc medical profession and banking, cotton and mercantile establishment?. The sporting fraternity were out In force, with representa? tives irom all the principal cities. Among the notables of the prize ring present are Tom Allen, Ned O'BaldwIn, "the Irish Giant," Tom 'Kelly. Sherman Thurston, Jim Cuslck, Jim Coburn, and Pooly Mace. THE PPBLlMIN'ABIES. The ring was pitched about twenty rods from the railroad track, in the pine woods. At 11.30 A. M. Coburn shied his hat in the ring, and immediately followed In person amia great cheers. Mace a moment later stepped Into the ring. Tom Mcalpine and Larry Powers were Coburn's seconds, and Cuslck and Tom Allen, Mace's. Colonel Rufus Hunt, of New Orleans, who was selected as referee, entered the ring amid tremendous cheering. He eald the men came here for a mir light, and supposed the crowd came for the same purpose. If they remained quiet and let the referee and umpires do the talk? ing, no doubt they would see a good fight. Mace won the toss for the choice of corners. Coburn advanced and offered to bet Mace $600, which Mace accepted. The umpires were Al. Smith for Mace, and Jim Coburn for Coburn. A drizzling rain was falling. The betting was two to one on Mace. THE 

FIGHT. Time was called, and business began. At precisely twelve minute.' past twelve P. M. the men put up their bauds across the scratch. Coburn was perceptibly the better trained man, there being hardly a pound of useless flesh upon him. His l!mb3 and chest were firm as whlp-cotd. In comparison, Mace was flabby, and his skin jaundiced. Coburn's welgnt was one hundred and sixty-three and a half pounds; and Mace's one hundred and sixty-five. Ihe only call then made wes three hundred to ono hundred and fifty on Mace,' with no takers. The first round re? sulted In some light body thumping, then a clinch and fall, with Mace under, lime thir? ty-one minutes. Mace forced the fighting in Coburn's corner, (the southeast,) and the lat? ter adopted defensive tactics. In this round Mace surprised his friends by not taking ad? vantage cf t TO elegant openings Coburn gave him. Coburn's claim of first blood was disallowed. ' Ia the next round, Mace had another opportunity, which he failed to Improve, and. the crowd was con? vinced that he was shy or did not care to bring matters to a climax. This round Ia?ted tea minutes, and was closed by a magnificent coup of Coburn clinching and throwing Mace In the centre of the ring. The third was a repetition of the others, and the fourth continued to over halt an hour In sparring, when the referee ad vueorrneni to qntt lr, and ea to fighting. Mace at once got In a double ciow on coburn's right jaw and right eye, bringing tbe claret out in a stream. First blow allowed to Mace. Previous to this neither bad received any punishment. The rain began to fall heavily, and both men were shivering with cold-Mace more than the other. After a short rest Mace dotted Coburn's other eye, closing the round with a fall to avoid Coburn's righi. An offer of 300 to 100 on Mace was not accepted. Mace's last blow co?t him the use ot his left hand, it being broken. The fifth round closed by Co? burn throwing Mace over the ropes In Jim's corner, both striking upon their heads. Tn the remaining rounds tnere was no heavy hitting, but Coburn forced the fighting, following the doughty Englishman to bis corner. Coburn had much the better wind, and, except the protuberances above bis eyes, was as fresh ss at the start. Though his right hand was badly swollen. Mace was on the defensive, and lt was evident that the game was in Co? burn's hands If he pushed lt In the sixth a couple of plumpers were found In Coburn's right hand, and a claim of "foul" was raised, but the referee ordered the fight to go on. Thence out the affair was but a sparring ex? hibition. Mace was nearly played, and hugged his corner. Coburn's friends urged him to push It, but Joe would not. THE LAST ROCND, which lasted over an hour,. resembled the Canada fiasco last spring; not a blow was struck. They were repeatedly called to the scratch, and finally the referee stepped into the ring sad said : "Tb ls crowd came here to see a fight. You have had every chance offer? ed, but seem afraid of each other. I there? fore declare the fight a draw and all bets off." The shivering crowd as well as the men were glad of this. Mace stepped up and shook Co turn's band, saying, "Joe, you are the beet man I ever met In the ring." Neither was badly hurt. Mace bad a severe contusion on his lett hip and a bad left hand. The "Man of Armagh's" handsome face was disfigjred somewhat, and his left hand laid up, other? wise he was unhurt. Both are censured by the public, and lt is regretted that the fight was not brought to a more definite conclusion.
