President Wilson In his message to cnogress departed from his established rule by doubling the length of his ad dress, but there are matters of vital importance with which he deals and they deserved more than hasty treat ment or mere enumeration. In calling attention as he does in the opening to the fact that "the states of America are not hostile rivals, but cooperating- friends, and that their growing sense of community of inter est, alike in matters political and in matters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in international affairs and in the polit ical history of the world" he sets forth a doctrine of Pan-Americanism which is timely and sound. He points out that the acts and purpose of this nation relative to other American re publics are in no way selfish, but for the common cailse of national Inde pendence and political liberty in Amer ica. To such an end conditions de mand that greater efforts be made than ever. National defense is a subject on which the president dwelt at length with an endorsement of the plans put forward by the navy and war depart ments for protecting the interests of this country and it is a well recog nized fact that on this It was impos sible for him to lay too much emphasis. Whether the ideas set forth are the best should be considered with an open mind for preparation should be "fitted to our needs and worthy of our tra ditions." As to providing the means for meet ing the additional expenditures which the country faces the president will receive much support in his belief that they should not be pushed along onto the next generation, but provided for as we move along. With the exception of the retention of the tax on sugar the president does not sanction any readjustment of The tariff in the inter est of revenue to meet our needs bu the part which foreign business can contribute and the protection of our industries ought not to be overlooked while new federal taxes are being ad vocated. Even a tariff for revenue only policy ought to be broad enough to look to such a source when revenue has gotten to such a low ebb. It is certainly a time when foreign as well ns domestic industry should be looked to to- solve the problem. When the president deplores the grave threats which have been made against our national peace and safety that have been uttered within our own borders and points out the surprising fact that the country is without ade quate federal laws to deal with the situation it is readily recognized as a matter which calls for the serious con sideration and early attention of con gress. He has directed attention to it in none too strong terms and in this connection it is equally important that the industries and resources of this country should be available and ready for mobilization. Tho policy of se curity demands it. Other matters to which the presi dent calls attention are the merchant marine, tb Philippines and Porto Rico, rural credits and the railroad trans portation problem, all of which are of d-ep concern and call for non-partisan nction. The message is one which every citizen should read. 

PEACE TERMS. While peace Is being urged and therefore being talked in certain quar ters, though it comes at a time when all of the aliie3 have reiterated their determination not to conclude a sep arate peace, interest is naturally at tached to tho grounds on which Ger many and France would be willing to end the war. Germany, if the one speaking for it knows his ground, would be willing to reestablish the old lines on the west and possibly cede to France the French speaking portion of Alsace, but it ivould insist upon retaining control In the Balkans, Including Constantinople and Asia Minor, holding sovereignty over autonomous Poland and establish ing buffer states between Germany and Russia. Under-Secretary of War Thomas, of France declares there will be no peace until France gets back Alsace and Lorraine, and insofar as France would not agree to terms of peace along the lines suggested from Germany there are equally good reasons why Russia, Ilaly and Great Britain would not be satisfied for they are fighting for the restoration of Servia as well as Bel gium now. Italy will insist upon that portion of Austria for which- it is lighting, in cluding Trieste, while Russia will be no better satisfied with Germany at Constantinoplo than with Turkey there, and Great Britain would like wise strenuously object to the ad vancement of Germany into the east. Russia, it is likely, will insist upon extending to Poland whatever freedom it is given, while the idea of creating suffer states comes as a strange sug gestion from Germany in view of the experience of Belgium and Luxemberg. The whole matter of peace therefore appears to be far off. or at least until something more decisivo in the way of results has been obtained. EDUCATION IN MEXICO. Confident months ago that he would hold the position which he now occu pies Carranza sent a large delegation of sc f iol teachers to this country for the pf pose of making a study of the educational systems in use in the United States with the Idea of adopt ing those which are the most advisable in the reconstruction work which it was apparent then Mexico must un dergo. He gavo full recognition to the needs of his country in that direction and to the part which education must Play in the Mexico of the future and he must be given credit for the ad mirable course which he adopted. Those teachers have had an oppor tunity of exceeding great value and it is to bo hoped that they have been so fully in accord with the work which needs to bo done and the cause in which they are interested that they have made the best use of the mission on which they were sent. Tho introduction of some of the ideas on which the public school sys tem of this country is founded into Mexico is not only needed now, but has been called for for a long time. Education hns been one of the great requirements of that country which has been sadly neglected. The delegation of teachers which is about to return has completed only a part of its duty, if they have been good observers they are now ready to do more for Mexico than all its revolu tions ever accomplished or ever will, but there remains the still more diffi cult job of establishing the system which is best suited to Mexico's needs. That i3 by far their hardest task and it depends not only upon themselves, but upon the backing they receive how tvell they succeed. They have never theless by Carranza's direction made the proper start. RECALLING DIPLOMATS. Following closely upon the announce ment by this government that Captains Boy-Ed and von Papen, attaches of the German embassy in this country are no longer acceptable in such ca pacities and the notification that it is desired that they be recalled, Germany makes a demand for the reasons for such a request. Germany is acting in this matter as if it was necessary for this coun try, or any country for that matter, to prove to the satisfaction of the coun try which such officials represent that they are not acceptable, when accord ing to the law governing such a situa tion nothing of the kind is necessary. Diplomatic representatives are recog nized and protected as long as they conduct themselves in a manner that does not antagonize the country in which they are located, but when the time comes that they exceed their rights or their activities are such that they cannot be tolerated the demand for their recall Is considered sufficient ground for acting in accordance there with. That is the position which this coun try has taken in this and other in stances. There have been times where reasons have been given for re calling diplomats, but there is noth ing which makes it obligatory and in this instance the interests of this country are served by not doing so. There has been no precedent estab lished -which requires it, as Germany fully understands, and Secretary Lan sing by his refusal makes it evident that he does not intend to be fright ened into doing what the government in this instance considers inadvisable. It Isn't improbable that Germany knows as well as. If not better than, the general public of this country why fhey should be recalled. 

EDITORIAL NOTES. Those who are doing it know what the many advantages are in early shopping. The recall of Captain Boy-Ed will at least take one of the hyphens out of the country. What has become of the old fash ioned man who believed that congress could take care of itself? Can it be that Germany is pre paring to call Captains Boy-Ed and von Pa.pen onto the carpet when they get home? Plenty of endurance may be dis played in a six day bicycle race, but It is nothing compared with what Ser via is showing. For a vessel equipped with wireless it takes a long time to find out what is the matter with the Minnesota ex cept that it is disabled. It apparently takes some countries a long time to understand that the rights and laws of neutral nations must bo properly respected. Too bad Mr. Ford didn't think of the idea of impersonating Santa Claus and start something which would real ly bring joy to the suffering of Eu rope. The man on the corner says: There are some people who would not admit that they were happy even if happiness had a habit of breaking out like the measles. If there are such things as automo biles on the other planets the discov ery of dust clouds thereon would in dicate that there is little respect even there for speed laws. That Maryland girl who bagged three partridges and a rabbit in short order has a better claim to marks manship than the hunter who fires at a moving bush and. kills a human be Ing. When the supreme court of Missouri declares that newspapers are of great er public necessity than railroads, street cars, telephones and telegraph it is quite evident that someone has been shown. A 70 -year-old Rockefeller office hold er has given up a $30,000 a year job because he considers men past 60- are "silly and irritable." It is a lucky thing someone else didn't give him that reputation. CALLING HIS BLUFF "111 bet you didn't miss me at all!" began the young married woman who had just come back from a trip away from home. "You wrote such snippy letters that didn't say anything! And you were the one who was going to be so lonesome and mass me so much! " "I did!" asserted her husband. "Humph." the young married wo man remarked. "If I hadn't planned out such a lot of things to occupy your time I'd be good and angry, but if you followed that program of course you didn't have much time to write" "Oh, I got along all right!" said her husband vaguely. "Of course I wasn't as gay as you were, back home there among all your old beaux you didn't mention Albert Giddings at all, by the way! I never had any use for Albert e was so doggone conceited! I suppose he's moved away, though " "Oh, no," said his wife, emiling a little. "Albert is still on hand!" "He is. is he?" exploded her hus band, setting down his coffee cup with unnecessary violence. "Funny you never mentioned him! I suppose he made himself just as obnoxious as ever! He " "Why, I used to be quite fond of Albert," said his wife reminscently. "I am aware of that fact!" said her husband. "I never could see what there was in that lank, lop-eared crea ture to attract any one! Oh, yes, I got along very well indeed while you were gone so many new shows in town and then the boys "I'm so glad;" said his wife sweet ly. "Did you get Tom Printley to stay over Saturday and Sunday with you? I suppose you golfed and had a great time!" "Yes, Tom came," said her hus band enthusiastically. "I didn't have a chance to get lftesome for a min- "His sister had some girl visiting her," he continued, "real cute little girl. And Tom let me in on -his Sat urday night theater party. We danced afterward, and, oh. we had a great old time! We golfed Sunday. Tom is a great fellow for doing things. He ran our phonograph till the people be- Stories of the War Routed the Foe. No incident of the war has taken so strong a hold on t-ne irencn imagina tion as that ot tne soluier who, in the press of the lighting, when most ot his comrades lay deau around him, called upon them as the Germans re peated tneir attack, "Lp with you, ye dead men!" and with the help of their spirits, assisted by a lew wounded, routed tae loe. The story is told in the Echo De Paris: '"The Germans had swarmed into a Frenh trench and broken down the resistance of the defenders, whose bodies covered the ground. Sudden ly a man rose, and, seizing a sack of grenades, he snouted 'Ueuout les Alorts!' At this summons the wound ed in the trench staggered to their feet and drove the enemy out." The hero of the episode was Lieut. Pericard. a man of oS, "whose hair is already white." He started the cam paign as a sergeant, but was quickly promoted to the commissioned ranks. Pericard is a man of intense religious feeling. This is his own story, as re peated by the Echo's interviewer: "The trench was full of corpses, with blood everywhere. At iirst 1 walked delicately, uneasy. I alone with all these dead. Then, little by little, I grew bolder and ventured to look at them. The seemed to be watching me. From our trench be hind my men were watching me with terror in their eyes, thinking, 'He's sure to be killed'. It is true mat the Boches were redoubling their ef forts. Their grenades were pouring down ana the stream of them was rapidly getting nearer. Was their sacrifice to be useless.' "I was seized with a holy madness. Of what I did, of what exactly I said. I no longer remember. 1 know only that I cried out. Get up. Why won't you get up?' Debout les mort!" nas it madness? No. because the dead answered me. They said, 'We are following.' "And as I cried to them their souls joined my soul and made a glowing mass or it, a stream of fused metal. Nothing could astonish or stop me. I nad the faith that moves mountains, the exaltation of the worker of mir acles, who by his will causes the mir acle. My voice, which was hoarse and worn out with shouting orders iur two days and nights, came back to me clear and strong. I feared nothing. I felt I was master of destiny. One of the men of my section, wounded in the arm, kept on throw ing grenades that were stained with his blood. As for me, I have the im pression of having had an increased bodily size. 1 was a giant with su perabundant, limitless energy, an ex traordinary ease of thought, which let me have my eyes in ten places at once, to give orders to one, to dictate and order to another, to shoot with a rifle, and at the same time to avoid a threatening grenade. It was a prod igiously intense life, with extraordin ary circumstances. Twice we ran out of grenades, and twice we found at our feet saekfulls of them mixed with sandbags. All day we had gone over them without seeing them. But it was the dead who had placed them there "All that night I kept the religious emotion that had seized me when I called on the dead. I felt something comparable with what is felt after a fervent communion." Military "Enoch Arden." A curious military "Enoch Arden" case has become known at Geneva. There were two men in the same reg iment from Lyons, France, named Du bois. One was married, the other sin gle. In the fighting in Alsace one of the Emile Dubois was killed the sin gle one but the death was reported to the wife of the other. This was in August, 1914. Madame Emile Dubois came to Geneva and after a year's mourning she maried another French soldier who is at the front and went to live again at her home in Lyons. A few days ago her first husband, who had recovered from his wounds, came home on leave and found his wife. It it not known what legal arrangements will be made.

""Funny you never mentioned his name among your partners! I " "Did you go to the club party Mon day as I told you to?" "Huh?" Oh. yes!" said her hus band with a returning wave of enthu siasm.

The theater was stupid and I never saw such idiots as there were at supper! I I stayed home the other evenings by myself! Gee! I'm glad you're back again!"

Middletown Press. It is argued justly, that a boy, minus knowledge of English, would run poor chances after going out in the world of getting into company with the kind of people in a position to help him. Having knowledge only of an alien tongue, he is forced to seek a small circle or go without any com munication with those of his own na tionality. A knowledge of English and the train of ideas which would naturally result from becoming ac quainted with the customs as well as the language of the country, would naturally result in a better under standing and appreciation of privi leges which they might enjoy for the asking.

Xew York is endeavoring to solve a problem that thus far has baffled not only the metropolis but almost every city and town in the United States. Xew York is trying to stamp out the automobile homicide the chronic speeder and inveterate joy rider who drives recklessly through the public streets, leaving mangled men, women and children in his wake. It is the most difficult problem that the police authorities of Xew York had had to deal with, and they frankly acknowledge it as such. But they declare that it will be solved, and that the automobile ruffian will be stamped out. Therefore the pub lic must act. And the more mangled children left lying in the streets in the wake of speeding chauffeurs, the greater will this sentiment of public indignation become until it will be overwhelming. But the pity of it is that so many little ones must die hor rible deaths and so many bereaved fathers and mothers must mourn be fore the public rouses itself sufficiently to make its protest effective.

The possession of tax-bearing property in a community spurs the owner to take a greater interest in its civic affairs and is an encouragement to a sane conservatism. When a man has property at stake in his commun ity he is disposed to see that he has personal interest which is closely identified with the interests of the city and will realize that the value of his property depends on the prosperity of the latter. In the different communi ties throughout the state the savings banks are the principal agencies for helping working people to secure their own homes and become tax-payers.

THE WAR PRIMER By National Geographic Society "The way from Koprili and Prilip to Monastir constituted one of the most difficult tits of ground covered by the Servian troops curing the war of the Balkan League against the Ottoman Empire, and today presents one of the more severe ways before invading troops," says a primer Just issued by the Xational Geographic Society: "A road was planned here by Ger man engineers, over ;the hi and through the narrow passes, ior the Ottoman government before the Bal kan war, in which Turkey lost this part of Macedonia to Servia. It has been largely completed between Ko prili and Prilip, but little or nothing has been accomplished along the sec ond part of the way. Krom Koprili, the way climbs over the hills, and by its sides grow wheat and corn. Ita valley soon narrows bringing the sparce'y wooded hill-sides close in upon the road, until it plunges into the famous mountain pass, which the Servians defended so stubbornly and galantly against Bulgarian invaders. "Here, it winds in terpentine curves up over ever-hanging cliffs, a miser able road, narrow, soft and filled with ruts and hollows. Toward its summit, there is a last steep climb called Prissat Pass, which lies 3,200 feet above the sea, and more than 2.300 feet higher than Koprili lies. It was in this strong summit position that the Servian army made the de fense, which held the Bulgarians for days at bay. The way descends to Prilip into the stony, little-cultivated, plain, which spreads between an s-shaped fringe of hills down to the city of Monastir. This fairly level way continues belong the last Servian stronghold into northern Greece. "From Monastir. with its mountains on either side and two before it. roads run north to Prilip, west into Albania, and south to Saloniki. Two of the roads by which Monastir communi cates with the outside world, are still open, that to the west and that to the south, while the Bulgarians are ap proaching along the third.
