Canard, a notd runner cf Montana, was tecently killed t Denver. It appears that Cazurd had entered int a match race cf eighty yards with a man whom he knew he could de feat, and on the strength vl his knowledgo he induced a friend to back him to the extent of J18.000.

Thbt have an expeditious way of paying off the employes of the Hudson River rail road. The paymaster rocs over tho road, paying ont $150,000 in greenbacks and eld. Tho train runs at its highest speed. Fay of tho flagmen between stations is put in cn velopes, and, attached to sticks, is thrown at the various flagmen as their shanties are passed. In this way $15,000 has bsen thrown from the pay car as tho train was Roing at the rate of nearly a mile a minute Competent. The Uodia Staiulard-News says: Tbo Virginia Enterprise and several ther newspapers are indignant at the ap pointment of Mr. Maddrill to tho position of Stato Printer f Kovada, and charge the State Printing Commissioners with allowing in proper influences to have governed them in making the appointment in the face, as they state, of the well-known incompetency of tho appointee. In point of fact, wo know Mr. Mnddtill to bo fully competont to fill the po sition. Aa an expert, practical printer, he has ho suporior in .Nevada, and as an honest man and gentleman, he is a peer to any man in that State, and tho Board, having a proper regard for the interests of Nevada, did well in making the appointment, and will da bet ter by seeing to it that no outside pressure be allowed to forco them te vacate it. Tan ruissiDEJfT's Message. The annual message of the President is scusrallj too long for most people to read, and we srive a boiled down version for tho boneat of people who hare no time to waste. It recognizes tho rights of negroes in the South; dwell upon the faot that there is much opposition to the free exercise of their suffrage, and recommends increased educa tional advantages. m Advocates Civil Service reform. Wants Polygamy stamped out. Recommend a modification of tho Chinese treaty. Wants several hundred million of bonds redeemed, and recommends that the silver .dollar bo rocoined ao aa to make it equal with i?ld. Says that coat defence need atrentheaiB(r. BuUxixea the navy.

Recommends that the remainder of the public lands bo set aside for the education of the illiterate. Calls upon Concrete to improve the Pat aiao Flats sod erect s monument to Weaning ten. The Enterprise during the past few mouths has hardly been able to appear in the morn ing without getting in its column of squoaling. Under the intelligent editorship of Joe Good man, Rollin Daggett and Charley Goodwin, the paper was a political pewer in Nevada. It was the ring-master in the political arena. It is now the clown. A clown who cannot dis guise its brainless mug with cheap cosmetics, or even make the readers forget the fact that a buffoon is airing his antics simply to till in the time until some newer and better feature is introduced. The Enterprise of yesterday devoted a column to the proposition of trying to prove that the Appeal was in imical to the scheme of ercctinc reduction works In Carson. At the time the Enterprise article was written tho writer must have read the following from tho Appeal of Saturday : The subject of building reduction works in Carson is being agitated and it. is hoped that the live men of the town will see the advis ability of contributing enough capital to go ahead and build the werka. When the new Carson and Colorado road is finished on one side, and the Reno road to Hodie cn the other eido, it will leave the town in a bad tlx. If reduction works were put up it would give employment to a vast number of men and keep tho Mint supplied with bullion. There is enough refectory ore in roveral districts about us to wsrra:it euoh an enterprise. Yesterday the Appeal contained tho only full rtport rf tho meeting held at the Dis trict Court-room. This is not ilia tirst time that the Appeal, duritia the p.-ist ton y ars, has approvingly written f this very scheme. Tho vriginators of the proposition railed at this effioo, not to ask thtl papi'r to endorse tho project as thoy hr.d rd doubt upon the subject but to ontlino tho general plan, that comprehensive assistance- might be rendered. We do not believe that a journalist ever suc ceeded in carrying a peun when ho wrote what ha knew to b; false. Tan impression which he eucceds in creating is h more a substantial fact than the vapors which rise from tho ground in tho morning. The asser tion that the ArriUL in opposing tho project hardly needs this space in contradiction, as any intelligent reader in this city (and many etiil read the Enterprise for i!s very complete telegraph Jdispatches) will realise before ho had finished tho article that tha writer is masking real intentions. Tho Enterprise dots not want to see me!ting works erected in Carson because certain Virgini-i crpitilistn ars anxious to erect them in Virginia City. The proposition that the Appeal wields such a J powerful infleac3 r.s to prevent capitalists from investing in Money making schemes, may bo flattering to the pride of this small journal but it is tow absurd to btr.seri.ms'y considered. auo atpeal, nowever, believes tint u can show capitalist who reside outride of Carson that this city sff.mh vastly superior facilities for i eduction. The tcacme to erect the works in Virginia City can never bo furthered in the least by throwing mud r.t tho plan of erecting them here. The ArrEAL will not be in the least ruffled by the abuse i f a man who has lost his temper er his head, and tho re duction works will not experience tho slight est bad effect from the frothiags of a news paper whoso circulation in Carson is dtcreas ing daily. Tho smelting works will bo erected hero because men of energy and capital are moving in tho matter, and because this locality is acknowledged to ba the locality for so sensible a project. At present thero are parties in Virginia City who would like to see the works in their own town. This is natural ; but wa thixk that when they have mere thoroughly canvassed the question they will be willing to assist Carson in tho scheme. If they are not, Oarson capital is amply able to finish the enterprise which Carson brains has organized. We hope that every reader of the Appeal will pcruss tho common-sense article in an other column from the pen of r.n old prospect or. It is full of food for reflection and writ ten by a man who has lost fortunes because thero wero no facilities at hand to work his ores. The London correspondent of the Woild informs that journal that Mr. Gladstono will rewavo Parliament to reward tho British hero f Candahar with a gift of 25,000, England is caroful to reward her heroes. Thadbeus Stevens' estate is almost settled, and it is bolieved there will bo enough be quest of 65,0000 for the founding of an asylum for orphan children.
