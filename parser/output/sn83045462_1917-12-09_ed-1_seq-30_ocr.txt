It is indicated that a disposition pre cis in the House of Representatives to *0 at once and thoroughly into the matter of the departmental ray wale' with a view to a revision to bring it up to the mark of present day necessities. This is well. It is to be hoped that the inclination of members to do justice to the government employes will result in an early amendment of the pay scale from top to bottom ? particularly the bottom-so that the United States gov ernment will not stand conspicuously as the poorest paymaster in the country. Efforts to this same end have been made in the past, but they have usual ly resulted in reference of the question to commission or committee, with noth ing accomplished. There is no occasion for an exhaustive an.l time-consuming inquiry. The facts are patent. The pay scale speaks for itself. It is altogether out of proportion to the needs of the people. It has stood unchanged for hair a century. This fact alone stamps It as out of date. Everything needed by the people who work for the government, as well as by those who work for others, has risen in price. The co?t scale will never go down to the point which pre vailed when the present pay scale was adopted. Meanwhile the question of continu ing the bonus gTant of last session ap pears to have been settled in the af firmative. The only present doubt is as to the amount. Since the 5 and 10 per cent increases were given the cost of living has risen, even in the past few months. Corporations throughout the country have recognized the fact and have advanced wages, by giving bonuses or by actoally increasing the scales. The only consideration at present should be how much higher these pro visional increases should go, pending a permanent revision of the scale. Fif teen per cent for all employes below J1.800 a year is suggested as just. Whilo the government is spending money at an enormous rate in the wag ing of the war, it cannot with justice denv a living wage to the men and women who are toiling on responsible and important duties in the transaction of. the business which involves those heavy expenditures. The fact that the budget is big beyoad all precedent is no reason for an economy that keeps the departmental clerks down to the edge of actual penury. The Russian Movie Serial. These repeated overturns in Russia are most annoying to the travelers and officials who have lately gone to Rus sia for observation and are now back home telling of their experiences and giving their views of what Russia is go ing to do." The tale of the March revo lution is already ancient history. The story of the days of Kerensky's rise and fall is no longer of great interest. Even the tale of the bolsheviki movement seems now to be out of currency. Rus sia is the greatest moving picture pre- j sented in the world today. It is like one of the serial films, which give "epi sodes" from week to week, with each section ending in a thrilling situation, a dramatic climax .to lure the patron on to further indulgence. And this Rus sian serial , is baffling to even the shrewdest guessers. No one can venture to predict the next episode or what the fend will be. Were it not for the impor tant bearing of the Russian situation on the general war condition it would stand as a diverting and entertaining spectacle. *" > . The most modern and convincing study In "efficiency" is to be found in the American training camp. It is the %fficieney which develops and utilizes Jot only physical power, but mentality j and. morale. Advice is given to eat freely the perishable foods; which recalls the be ginning of the old recipe for welsh rabbit: "First catch your hare." Some of the Russians, accustomed to persecution, probably imagine there is nothing going on worse than the ordi nary -massacre. Women and the Hext House. This is from Albany: "Gov. Whitman has advised the Anti Saloon League that he favors an emer gency state-wide prohibition law during the war. The governor also said he would support for Congress a woman in place of any man opposed to a nation wide referendum on prohibition." An interesting suggestion in connec tion with .next year's campaign is that a number of women in states where women have the vote may offer for Congress. Miss Rankin has scored. She is diligent, and speaks welL The duties of. the office are within her rang*. She is a student of politics and government. Where else than in Con gress has such a student, man or wom an, a better ehanee to serve the pnblict There are many capable politicians among women. They 'have been de veloped hiy the "drives" for suffrage that have bees made in the past decade. bean active in polities, municipal, atata and national. Even in the south?the section conservative on that question? the influence of women, exerted in an indirect way, has appeared in election results. | Now, more than ever, there is a lure in polities for women ambitions of a public career. A new order is starting, and they want to start with it. The (rid order, with which they had little to do, is passing. New issues of great scope are appearing, and old issues, when not scrapped, are undergoing change. The new order may lead far, and, no matter how far, will contain much of marked concern for both sexes, and all creeds and complexions. American re sources of all kinds will come into play. A general purpose runs?^to make Amer ica greater than ever before, and fully equal to all opportunities. The presence of half a dozen women in the next House would add to interest in that body, and might show in the legislation that will be enacted on the eve of a presidential campaign. The Sixty-sixth Congress will meet in first regular session in December, 1919, and between then and the following sum mer much of what it does will go to the shaping of the two national platforms, and mayhap to the naming of the pres idential candidates. On every account, it is going to be a very interesting body; and all who serve in it are cer tain to find their work exciting to a degree. A Promising Journalist. Mr. Boosevelt is making progress as a journalist. That is to say, he is choos ing timely topics, and packing his meaning into a brief space. As the say ing is, he is getting the hang of the thing. He is entitled to the greater credit because of the fact that as the bolder of a pen he started as a writer of books. He learned his trade with plenty of elbow room. He could condense or elab orate as the fancy struck Mm?as his judgment dictated. He oftener elab orated than condensed. As he was free to choose his subjects, he chose such as appealed to him strongly; and, being a man of enthusiasms, when he got start ed he let himself go. As a journalistic commentator he must be brief. It is a rule of the game, and to succeed he must play the game according to rule. He is doing it, and doubtless will succeed in his new endeavor. What of the future f If his success is marked, wHl journalism hold himt He is suspected of a desire to retnrn to the White House. But suppose 1m misses that goal. Will he care for any other office f Would any other suit himf While he lives he will be all alive, and busy. Public affairs, and particu larly political affairs, are his specialty. He knows a good deal about them, and follows them closely. He must be either making history himself, or commenting on history made by others. So that if he has made his last history in the White House, he could hardly do better than set for himself the task of com menting on the history made there by others. Shall we see Mi. Boosevelt aspire to, and achieve, the editorship and pro prietorship of a great metropolitan daily t Look at Mr. Clemenceau. He has found profit, influence and pleas uro in journalism. Pen in hand, he has done some notable things in French pol itics. For the second time he haa writ ten himself into the premiership, and has written out almost a dozen cabinets. The chances are against long service in his present post; and when he yields place to another he will take up his pen again. And there was Lord Salisbury, who when young and poor was a leader writer for a London newspapei. In that place, as he afterwards confessed, he learned much which he p^ to good service when he became the leading figure in the British parliament. Had fate deprived him of both honors and fortune, Lord Salisbury might have re sumed "writing pieces for the paper." His early talent remained with him to the end. Lenine, of course, has his eye on the munitions shipped from this country, with the intention of placing them in the hands of the Bussian government. And Germany has her eye on Leaine as the possible recipient of go valuable a. consignment. ... . Chicago's chief of police proposes to put the cabarets out of business. He will find support in the great ?rt cen ter of the middle west, whether he speaks as a public official or a critic. If the dead German found near the exploded naval magazine was respon sible for the Halifax disaster, there is in his ease no room for debate on the old question, "Is suicide a crime f Col. House tried his hand very suc cessfully in a competition of marks manship abroad. Evidently the eolonel is more sociable in Freneh than he ia in English. New Yorkers in Retirement. Mr. Fitzgerald's step calls to mind a list of New Yorkers who have served in Congress, are stHl young enough to do excellent service there, and yet, for one reason or another, are now in private life. 1 One is an orator of extraordinary power. Bourke Cockran is of the Daniel O'Connell school. His vocabulary is rich, and his action energetic. He had not his equal as an entertainer when be served ia the House. The announee ment of a speech by him filled every I seat in the chamber, upstairs and down. But, in some way, he clashed with the | leader of Tammany Hall, and the clash Be ha* MA a* ?iH ' since, mad shows no dlrtre to rotvra to public service. Another victim of Tinuunj is Goocgo B. McClellan, who left Congress for the mayoralty of New York, clashed with Charles P. Murphy, aad lost out He has not hefd office since, aad is no longer mentioned for political prefer* meat. He is a man of excellent ability, and served his people well in the Honse. William Saber's fate is recent. ' He left Congress for thf governorship of New York, but held the office only a short time. He eiashed with Tammany, with the usual result. He figures no more in political gossip. Martin H. Glynn was a member of the House some years ago, but came to more distinction after he retired and entered state politics. Beaching the governor's chair through the failure of Mr. Sulser, he earried himself well in the office, but could not maintain him self against the drift to the republicans following the Sulzer failure. He is editing with ability a democratic news paper, and in that way assisting his party. James A. O'Gorman found one term in the Senate enough. He made repu tation in the chamber, and showed in dependence in the appraisement and discharge of his duty. For a man who had been trained for the bar, and had spent a number of years on the bench, he "took to" polities quite readily. But he has returned to the bar, and with the intention, it.is reported, of eschew ing active politics henceforth. Mr. Fitrgerald gives a good reason for retiring. For family uses he needs a larger money return for his labors. He brought no money into polities, and he is taking none out. He is a lawyer, and New York at present ia regarded as a paradise for those who arc well up in the profosison, and young enough, as he is, to strike, and keep, the prevailing pace. Saraj Day by Day. Besides raising funds for the govern ment for use in the prosecution of the war, the sale of 25-cent stamps to the people will encourage nation-wide thrift that cannot fall to b6 permanently holp ful. The two billion dollars that it is cxpected these certificates will bring will not be missed from the currency of the people. We are a rather prodigal nation in the matter of small change., Pennies, dimes and niekela are lightly considered. Ia the main we get little for our money. Now there is an op portunity placed at the very doors of all the people through the post office system to save daily the hitherto un considered trifles of cash wasted on worthless objects. Millions of children throughout the United States can save now with a purpose, and parents have a chance to teach them one of the most useftal lessons in life. A well filled war thrift stamp card will soon become an object of pride to a child who is striv ing to cover the squares and get a cer tificate. There are countless litHe jobs to be done by boys and girls in pay ment for small bits of money that can be quickly turned into a savings ac count with Uncle Sam as baaker. This form of war revenue affects business in appreciably and may be the means of turning the American people definitely Into thriftful ways. Now and then Washington, like every other city, is compelled to refrain for a day or two from boasting of her elimate. Even in declaring war, the considera tion asserts itself that Austria-Hungary is even more to be pitied than censured. Mas Harden says Germany must win or be crushed. He expresses a world wide opinion. Alien enemy members of orchestras find that music has irritations as well as charms. SHOOTnro

WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS Probably no year in the history ot the United States showed greater prog ress in the mineral In The dustrlee than the pres Tnilii.il- ent one> scoordlng to XnttUltry. officials of the bureau of mines. Although this progress was | undoubtedly stimulated by the War In Europe, which Is causing extremely high prices for some of the metals, yet the fact remains. It la pointed out, that mining Is being regarded more as a business and less as a speculation, and the benefits of business methods are becoming evident. Those who are in close touch with the mining Industry at the bureau say that practices that were almost uni versal a few years ago have been large ly abolished, the mining public has been brought to recognise the folly of wasteful and dangerous methods and there is a unanimity of opinion In re gard to the conservation of life and health, as well as of our mineral re [ sources. Besides, the people of the United States realise more fully than [ ever before the extent and value of the country's resources and the possibili ties that await intelligent and well directed efforts at utilisation. ' In the past, economic reasons caused deposits of valuable metals and Indus trial materials* to lie Idle; commercial reasons, many of them not truly eco nomic. led to the waste of valuable con stituents in many ores: the recovery of minerals from the ground was too oft en incomplete and accompanied by un oalculated loss, and the treatment of ores in mills and smelters saved alto gether too low a proportion of the metals sought. Now. it Is said by those who know, ? better methods are being tried on every hand, and the unparalleled record of the year In largely due to the success of these efforts. The bureau of mines is endeavoring to Increase the safety and health of workers In the mineral Industries and to promote greater efficiency and the prevention of waste In the mining, i preparation and utilization of the mln- j oral resources of the United States. Although many difficulties have had to be overcome, It is believed that the work accomplished by the bureau has kept paoe with the progress of the mineral Industry as a whole. The in crease of efficiency and the lessening of waste, quite naturally, are of high importance In mining, and Investiga tions with these ends In vletr have been furthered to the utmost, but such work, iiw Pointed out, must come second, when there Is opportunity for work that will Increase safety and health of the workers in mines and mills. * ' ? * * Th^t the responsibility for the keep ing qualities of apples must be shared equally between growers Storing an<5 handling . organlxa a t ions, on the one hand; and W cold storage warehouse men, on the other. Is the conclusion reached by specialists of the Depart ment of Agriculture as S. result of In vestigations to determine the factors of greatest Importance in successful storage of the fruit, so important at this time. The investigations disclosed that if the fruit is to be stored moat satis factorily. and is to be got into the hands of the consumer in excellent condition the grower's part should be. first, to produoe the beat possible fniit, sound, well colored and free from decay or blemlah of any kind; and, second, to have it carefully har vested at Just the proper degree of maturity. The handler's part should be so to handle the fruit in harvesting, hauling.. grading and packing that it will not be bruised, scratched or in jured. Growers, shippers and ware housemen Should co-operate to get the fruit Into cold storage as soon as pos sible after It Is harvested. Jhe ware housemen should then hold the ifrult at as low a temperature as possible with out subjecting It to the dangers of freezing. The fruit should be. care fully watched, with a view to dispos ing of It while in good market condi tion. The experts say that apples from orchards badly infected with disease, and apples generally that are borne on trees lacking vigor, are likely to decay early In their storage life, and well colored portions of the skins of apples seldom. If ever, develop scald. In experimental work carried on by the department, apples were stored un der similar conditions when picked Immature, mature and overmature. In all cases the apples picked at maturity kept beet. The best degree of matur ity, it was found, is something short of eating ripeness, but after the color has developed beyond the ? leaf-green shade. The importance of keeping the skins of apples unbroken was demonstrated. Every bruise and scratch furnishes a possible point of entrance for fungous organisms causing decay. Nail punc tures and other Injuries to the skin that are so small as to pass unnoticed by the average observer may result In serious loss through the entrance of decay organisms. * * * During the past year trajn accidents, comprising fifty-four collisions and twenty-six derall Investigating ments, have been] Train TIT. i__ investigated hy the Train Wrecks. bureau ln chare# of this work at the Interstate Commerce Commission, according to experts em ployed In this connection. In these ac cidents 174 persona, were killed and 82T were Injured; the collisions caused the death of 132 persons and the .injury of 638 persons, while in the derailments 42 persons were killed and 189 were Injured. Twenty-one of the collisions Investi gated occurred on block signal lines, eleven In automatic block signal terri tory and ten ln non-automatic block signal territory, while thirty-three of the collisions occurred o? lines oper ated by the train-order-and-time-lnter val system. Of the eleven collisions Investigated which occurred ln automatic block sig nal territory, eight were due to failure of enginemen to obey signal indica tions. This comparatively large num ber of accidents of that character em phasizes the necessity, the experts point out. for the development and use of Some form of automatic train con trol device to supplement existing block signal apparatus. Of the other three collisions investi gated which occurred in automatic block signal territory one was caused by failure of a switch tender to note the position of the switch indicatbr be fore opening a switch to permit a lo comotive to make a crossover move meat, ana the otl>?r two w** CMilt by Improper ? practices confined to a ltrge extent to the roads or localities where theee accidents oooarred. The Investigation of the collisions which occurred In non-automatic hlock signal territory has almost without ex ception disclosed lax observance or en forcement of rules- Nearly all of theee accidents which were Investigated dur ing the past year could have been averted, the officials say. by proper ob servance of the rules which were In effect. More than half of the collisions dur ing the past year occurred on lines op erated by the traln-order-and-time-In terval system. In some cases inade auate operating rules were found, and In other Instances It was found that practices^ not sanctioned by the rules were being followed. Many of these accidents wei-e due to Inherent week ness^p of the time-Interval method of operation, and a large proportion of them oould have been prevented, the experts declare, by a proper applica tion of the block signal principles. Those who are in closest touch with this accident work are urrln^ that the roads -be required to standardise oper ating rules. It is essential, they de clare. to the safety of train operation that rules be explicit and uniform, ca pable of being easily understood and applied, and. not liable to be misinter rupted. Such standardisation of rules can be accomplished only by federal legislation. Twelve of the twenty-sl^ derailments investigated were caused by defective condition of track and track equip ment. and three were due to defective car and locomotive equipment. In nine of the derailments speed was the direct cause or contributing factor; one was caused by failure to obey a signal In dication. and, one by the neglect of a train crew to make proper tests of brakes, resulting In a runaway on a mountain grade. The experts state that accident sta tistics demonstrate that a large per centage of the derailments occurring from year to year Is due to two causes, namely, defects of equipment and defects of roadway. ? * * More petroleum was produced In Kansas In 1916 than In any other year In the history of the Petroleum petroleum Industry In j that state, aeoordlng to in AU1IM. experts of the geolog ical survey. This Is interesting In view of the large quantities of this com modity that are being used in connec tion-with the war. According to the figures collected by the specialists of the survey, recently completed, 8,738.077 barrels of crude petroleum were marketed from wells In Kansas in 1016. This quantity Is nearly double the output in any pre ceding year and was 228 per cent more than the 1915 output. The average price received for this oil at the wells was $1.18 a barrel, and the total market value of the output was f10.330,958. These figures show a gain of 68 fents In average price per barrel and 507 ? per cent gain In the total market value of the oil sold over the previous year. The stimulus to field activity fur nished by the more favorable market for petroleum and by the existence in Kansas of. two prolific sources of new production resulted in the completion of 3.624 wells during the year. Of these 8,142 ware oil wells, credited with an average yield of seventy-nine barrels each during the.first twenty-four hours after completion. * * * The number of new teachers required annually to fill vacancies In the public and private elementary Training of and high schools In the T ' ' United States Is esttmat eachers. e(j officials of .the bu reau of education to be approximately 110,000, of which more than S5.000 are required by rural schools. The number of graduates from our normal schools and from classes, schools and departments of education in our colleges and universities is loss than S6.Q00 This "leaves nearly 100,000 positions to be filled each year by teachers who have not had the educa tion and professional training of these schools. It has been found by. Investigation thftt most of the graduates from the normal schools and of the graduates In education from the colleges and uni versities find positions as teachers In high schools, or elementary schools of cities and larger towna Only a small per cent, therefore, of the teachers In the rural schools of most states have any adequate professional training. As a partial remedy for this evil nearly half the states have provided for some degree of professional In struction and training of teachers In county normal schools of elementary grade or in public high schools. The growing recognition of the need that teachers In rural schools should have at least some degree of professional training has resulted In a rapid exten sion, the officials say, of this policy and a desire on the part of school officers, legislators and students of education for Information In regard to Its re sults. For that reason experts of the bureau of education have just com pleted a survey of the subject. There Is considerable difference of opinion, among, educators in regard to' the wisdom of preparing rural teachers In academic Institutions of secondary rank. Many fear that this may result In lower standards of academic work, while others insist that such teacher preparation will add dignity and a new sense of responsibility to the tasks of the secondary schools. A previous survey by experts of the bureau has shown that one-thir<J of the great army of JS0.000 rural teachers now in the service have little or no profes sional preparation for'their work. Ac cording to the same study. It appears that the average rural teacher remains In the teaching profession less than four years of 140 days each. This means that a number of teachers equal to the entire personnel must be brought Into the schools every four years, or that about 87,600 new teaph ers must be provided annually. Those who have made this study say that It seems certain to them that the normal schools and other higher pro fessional schools must begin In all se riousness to. work out the problem of adequate preparation for rural teach ers within their own Institutions, or secondary schools will become per manent teacher-training institutions. In sections of the country where the normal schools have been able to of fer specialised preparation for teach ers the demand for similar Instruction in the high schools is very limited. In sections where the normal schools have their hands full preparing teachers for town and city schools additional nor mal schools ought to be provided, the officials say. wherein to prepare strong teachers for the large number of farm community schools which are rapidly developing in every section of the country.

FIFTY YEARS AGO IH THE STAR 4 The subject of the Washington canal was one of considerable complication fifty years ago. being VaabJafton aS Canal. affecting Its maintenance *nd management. In The Star of De cember 2. 1867, is the following: "If our councils are not prepared to see the control of the Washington ca nal slip out of their hands altogether. It behooves them to take some prompt action In regard to Improving its condi tion. We learn that private parties have a bill prepared to be presented at the earliest moment in the Home, giv ing them the entire franchise of the canal and possession of Its borders, and Its passage will be urged on the ground that the corporation ofWashlngtonhas shown Its incapacity to deal with it. The bill passed by the boardr of alder men recently seems to afford the only effective remedy for the canal nuisance. It proposes to dredge the canal thor oughly and hereafter keep it well dredged. When once cleaned it can be kept cleaned for an annual sum of not more than 14.000. and responsible par ties guarantee to keep it well cleaned for that sum. It is not worth while to enter Into the question whether it will pay commercially to have the canal cleaned. We must look at the ques-1 tlon In a sanitary point of view. The canal- is and necessarily must be the great trunk for the sewerage of the j city and It must be kept In a condition | to promptly carry off the matter thrown Into it by the sewers, Whether the city derives any profit from it for canal pur poses or not. The necessity for this is becoming every day more imperative. In conseauence of the increased amount of matter finding Its way into the ca nal. At the rate connections are being made the canal, under the heat of the summer sun of next year. will be the most intolerable pestilence-breeding nuisance Imaginable. The only rem edy le the prompt and thorough clean ing of the canal this winter, and the councils cannot legislate, too .speedily to that end. In any event, the canal as the great artery of the city's sewers must be kept under the control of the city." * * * In view of the tense relations between President Johnson and Congress the annual message of the President's Chief executive fifty years __ ago was the subject of Message. tj,e keenest Interest. So eager, indeed, was the public that there was some anticipation of the formal delivery of the document, morning papers In Boston, New York, Cincinnati. Chicago, St. Louis and Philadelphia printing it in full or in part on the morning of the delivery. Naturally this created a sensation. It was made the subjeot of comment in Congress. The Star of December 3, 1S67, says: "When the President's message was received in the House this morning Oen. Schenck of Ohio called the at tention of the members to the fact that while the message was addressed to the Congress .of the Cnited States it had already been spread before the country In the newspapers. He said ha understood it had been sold to the newspaper correspondents by some lackey or hanger-on of the White House. Mr. Schenck accused the Pres ident of disrespect toward Congress and Intimated that on this account the House might refuse to have the mes sage read. He would not. he said, make that motion, though he might Justly do so Mr Covode exclaimed in an excited manner that the President had sold the message on the streets and that ne ought to be impeached. These proceed ings were received with significant winks in the reporters' gallery, espe cially among those correspondents ?ho telegraphed' the message last night. It is alleged by the transgressors that the correspondent of the Boston Post peddled the message yesterday bi' lf e graph through all the cities of the countrv, compelling them to send the message to their papers in self-de fense." ? * * ' In The Star of December 7, 1867, is a news item on the first page stating that the House that Impeachment afternoon had voted against the Impeach Defeated. ment of the President, which appeared to put an end to the proceedings. Subsequently the im peachment was voted. The Star article 8 "In the House this afternoon the question of impeachment was finally disposed^of by a vote of 57 ayes and 108 noes, on the motion of Mr. Lopan for the adoption of the majority report of the judiciary committee, favoring im peachment. This decisive vote puts an end to the matter beyond any chance of resuscitation. The vote was taken amid much excitement, and with pro found silence on the part of the audi ence. save when a busz ran along the galleries following upon some unex pected vote being given pro or con. The fate of impeachment was pretty soon settled when men of the promi nence in the republican or Messrs. Banks, Baldwin, Bingham, Blaine. Dawes. Eliot. Laflin. Ingersoll. Garfield, Poland, Spalding, Van T* yck. the Washburns, Welker. Woodbr.dge and James F. Wilson were found vot ing against It. Some vent to the ex cited feeling was afforded from time to time by the laughter occasioned by odd excuses and explanations made by dif ferent members. Mr. Broomall rose to say that his colleague, Mr. Schofield, was not here, but that if he were here he had no doubt he would vote right. Mr. Miller of Pennsylvania said he would vote no on the ground that the evidence was not strong enough to sustain Impeachment. Mr. Eldridge (dem.) said that was precisely the rea son why he voted against it. Mr. Stevens was not in the hall when the vote was taken, but came in subse quently and was the last or fifty seventh man to vote for impeachment. AH the four Washburns (Cadwalader C of Wisconsin, Elihu B. of Illinois. Henry D. of Indiana and William B. of Massachusetts) voted In a row against impeachment. The vote of ""y-seven for Impeachment is precisely the num ber estimated for it some days ago in The Star Had every member in favor of Impeachment been present, however. It would have secured sixty votes, and had every member opposed to it been present the vote against it would have reached the number of 124. The vote of 108 asjainst impeachment may be set down as composed of sixty-nine re publicans and forty-nme democrats. Mr Mvers of Pennsylvania stated that, having been prevented from offering a resolution of censure of the President he should vote aye. It was expected by some of the friends of Gen. Butler that when the test questfcn came he would vote no. but he seems to have felt himself committed with the impeach ment theory-"

HEARD AND SEEN, .The senators and representatives are back in town for the highest session of Congress perhaps that this country has ever seen. One and all they are determined to back the President. They are back, and they are back of Wilson. These are serious days, big days, days th&t in years to come will be regarded as epochal days. Yet We who are actually living in these "big- times" sometimes fail to feel that today is any different from any old day, or that yesterday was any different, or that tomorrow will have a different flavor frpm-past days. The little affairs of daily life intrude. In the hfstory books all we "get are the big events. Getting: up in the morning:, eating breakfast and hurryfng off to work never get into the history books. They leave the humor out of the hisfbries. But it Is not left out of our day-by day life. Even these busy congressmen are still finding time to relish all the fun that crops up. You can settle the fate of nations and still enjoy a joke. Truly, we need all the humor we've got in war time. It is serious enough business without making it any more serious than we have to. (President Wilson finishes sentences that way!) ^ One representative I know has a sense of humor as big as his body and kindly heart. He asked, me not to mention his name in connection with this recital, because he is tender re specting the feelings of "the folks back horned' ... . He just got back from the home state. Those constituents pf his hate sham and pretense of "all sorts. They hate affectation so much that sometimes? quite often, in fact-?they imagine peo ple are "putting on" when they are not. Some woman, moved away from the old town to a big city, for Instance, will -come home on a visit one day. She will be well dressed. The women of the town will look her-over and say: ".Doesn't she think she's smart!" Poor lady! That's the last thing she thinks she is. She has been to the city and knows she i* not particularly "smart." But those "horUe folks" know better. This congressman of ours changed trains at Podunk for Potato flollow. "Is Potato Hollow the terminus of tfcis line?" he casually inquired of the conductor. The old, gr*y-haired conductor looked him up ar\d down calmly and then with malicious enjoyment: "That's as fur as she goes." ? a a Commissioner Gardiner is KavtBtf more fun out of the job of being oM of the three "governors" of the National Capital than any other mat who held the office, I believe. It is a pleaa* ure to see and listen to a man whs seems to enjoy and rejoice In what ha is doing. He has an informal way of talking to citizens' associations that is making quite a hit around town with the mem* here of the various associations. For Instance, at a meeting or the Cw lumbia Heights Association the othe* night the Commissioner told about when he was a. young man, how ha went out on one of his first cases. Judge Bundy. who sat in the audiences was the magistrate who heard that case. The judge had a smile on hia face all the time Commissioner Gardi? ner was telling of t|r-gone days. "Judge Bundy had an office On 8th strajet then." said Mr. Gardiner. I came around al! prepared Xo win my case. I had on good clothes and my trousers were creased both front arid back, and I had three big books. X thought I was going to win easily. "The opposing counsel came in aftef* awhile. He wasn't at all stylish, and he carried no law books." The Commissioner grinned. "I found out afterward that his pe? culiarity was that he never wore * neW suit and he always wore a somewhat soiled collar." The Commissioner grinned agattk "But he certainly knew law." Picture a young man on a street can He holds his ticket out to the con? ductor. He profTers a perfectly good ticket for a perfectly poor ride. A full faro for a squeezed-up, jammed-in-the-ribs ride. Nevertheless, he held the ticket ou% to the conductor. (Let us change ou$ tenses, if not street cars.) He kept on holding it out. The conductor extended his han& He extended his hand languidly. When his hand was six inches frofll the ticket it stopped. Passenger's ticket and conductor** hand in repose. Neither hand nor ticket moved. The passenger could stand the strain no longer. "Say!" he roared, in a voice that filled the car. "Do you want me to feed it to you?"

The one with joy bubbles in his veice had enlisted upon the declaration of war. Before that lie was a traveling man. And his bouyant assurance that the cathedrals of Europe had nothing on South Bend, Ind., gave . token of how loyally a man may love his home.v The other had seen ? service in the Philippines. In his eyes was the know4edge that bolos give. And to hear his quiet voice was to understand how it is that a man dare follow wher ever a flag leads the way. Moreover, he could fry German potatoes by an other name. All of which, dear Everybody, .is to herald the fact-?not arrogantly, Cinder stand?that these sons of Mars Who had the right of way to any Thanks giving dance, play, banquet or other froMc which Washington hospitality could think up, deliberately decided In favor of the two old maids you must have read about?the ones who wanted to ask a small share of the Army to dine, but didn't dast for fear the guests might consider themselves stung. So they came?Would you mind bow ing three times? Just to show the fine training of earth-planet parents, before the war srod set his brown seal on the two, here's what happened when, the time came to expose the villainy of a soul less trust that had wished stogies on a guileless hostess, instead of well paid for cigars: Joy Bubble took a whiff, threw back his head, shut his eyes and breathed rhapsodic expectancy?you know hpw men go on?waiting for the smoke to spiral up. Which the smoke didn't. Then the bolo-man took a eulogistic sniff and helped himself to his own cigar ettes. There was a reason?you would' have guessed it at the very first puff, if you had ever kept company with tobacco crops from hills to hogsheads; counting in ground leaves, worms after the plants and turkeys after the worms, horncasters, gummy pink suck ers and the aroma that goes with stripping on a damp day in the barn? bless his heart, he didn't even change countenance when offered the left overs to smoke on the way to?never mind where. This is war time and you have to be careful. It would be fine if the festivity could stop right here, but?owing to the law which forbids the maligning of one's fellow man, the seeming poor taste of the guests in the selection of hostesses is hereby most reluctantly explained. They were family men, and, naturally, were too homesick for their wives and children to link up with any of the gay doodads of the day. And yoii know, as well as the next, that nobody on top of the earth could ever mistake an old maid for any gay doodad. Not if he lived on the street called Sane. Still, even at that, there's a differ ence between spinsters of the species, along with the other Kipling females? to wit: When the evening had become a mat ter of hail and farewell, one or the presiding elders?the one whose re sponses to every war need that comee along have already stocked her up with bond buttons, orphans, comfort bags, trench candles, war daddy Sammies ? and "Soldiers' French"?said unto the other?of whom the least said the soonest mended: "They seemed to stand us all right, Ann. Let's invite a couple of sailors." Unfortunately for the proposition, the trail of the stogie was making Itself home. The Ann one sniffed It. Any body could. "And after that, we can ask two' narines. And I hope Joy Bubble :he bolo-man will come back some time for supper, don't you?" The other one undoubtedly hoped so, too, but she didn't say it. Tou know iow It is when you have a stogte on four mind. Especially when yon >ought it yourself. .
