FOOD FACTS. How to Properly Feed the Body. Physicians nowadays realize how nec essary it is that the food contain the right elements that the body requires to rebuild itself, and replace the loss that occurs each day from activity and energy. If one lifts an arm, that means the expenditure of a small amount of en ergy, and the burning up. so to speak, of certain deposits from the food. This means a certain loss, and this loss must be made up each dav from food. If the food does not contain the things re quired, nature hoists a flag of distress; aches, ails, sickness of some sort sets in, meaning that there is something lacking in the food. The reason physicians so generally advise the use of Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food is that they know from what it is made and what it contains. The medi cal journals in various parts of the world have given the analysis. The fa mous "London Lancet" went so far as to make a very careful analysis by its own chemist- Its remarks axe worth repeating. "The preparatory process undoubted ly converts the food constituents into a much more digestible condition than in the raw cereals. This is evident from the remarkable solubility of the prepa ration. No less than one-half of it be ing soluble In water. The soluble portion contains chiefly dextrin and no starch. According to our analysis the following is the proportion: Moisture .02 per cent. Mineral matter 2.01 " " Fat 1.60 " Proteids 15.00 " Soluble Carbohydrates 49.40 " " Unaltered carbohy drates 25.97 " " The feature worthy of note in this analysis are the excellent proportion of proteids and mineral matter, and scal able carbohydrates. The mineral matter is rich phosphoric acid. Our analysis shows that it is a nutritive of high order, since it con tains the constituents of a complete food in the right proporitions, and in an easily assimilable state." Notice the carbohydrate total is about 75 per cent. These produce energy and warmth. The phosphoric acid in the mineral matter comes, as do all of the other ingredients, from the field grain, not one particle being introduced as a drug. Physicians know that the soft matter In the brain and nerve centers through out the body are made from the ele ments of albumen acted upon by phos phate of potash. Albumen is a very common article in almost every food, but phosphate of potash does not exist in all foods, nor is it found in easily digestible form always. However, in Grape-Nuts these elements exist, and are presented to the body in an easily digestible form, and explain the reason why users feel the new spring of life, the brain and nerve power increase, after they have been using Grape-Nuts tor a. time. There is a reason for it. The doctors know it, therefore they pre sKribs Giaie-NLs. of cruelty. She says he threw hot grease in her face.

He is the man who somewhat recently sold his elegant home in xo peka to the state for the governor's residence. According to the Kansas City Jour nal, the following is the latest scheme of the Kansas shale promoters: "In case the report of Professor Fahrig, of Philadelphia, shows that the Trego shale does not contain gold in quan tities sufficient to pay for mining, the promoters may adopt a new scheme to get money on it. A recent run showed 2Vb cents to three tons of shale. This would be five-sixths of a cent to the ton. It is estimated that there are 400,- 000,000.000.000 tons of shale in that dis trict. At five-sixths of a cent per ton this would make three and one-third trillions of dollars. The promoters are thinking now of just getting the gov ernment to accept their estimates and issue paper money against the amount of gold in the shale and leave the shale undisturbed.

Atchison, Dec. 5. A wholesale raid was made on the farmers ducks north of town a few nights ago, and it is es timated that fully 300 fowls were taken. Nothing but ducks were stolen. Among the losers are Ben Curtis, Mike Langan, Frank McCoy,, Henry Craw ford, Henry Franklin and J. Myers. As is well known, ducks roost on the ground. Therefore the thieves had nothing to do but pick up the ducks by the neck and make away with them. The thieves made a regular round-up, GIRL FROM DODGE. Daughter of Kansas Physician Seen at "The Crawford." ESifijQsiits ODD0 "We have heard a great deal about "heart to heart talks." The little talks where people get right down to honest reason, to common sense. Tou have no doubt at some time or other experienced the annoying and painul symp toms of indigestion. Digestion is the pro cess by which nature transforms our food, by means of various juices called digestants, into blood which is then carried throughout the body and used to make flesh, muscle, bone, nerve, brain and material of every kind of which the body is composed. Indigestion may arise from a variety of causes, but generally because some of the elements which make up the digestive juices are lacking. Undigested food gives you all kinds of trouble. In the first place you have a most distress ing feeling in your stomach, especially after eating. Soon this undigested food ferments, the gas distends the stomach, and in its ef forts to escape, it causes belching. It also causes a pressure against the nerves and arteries leading to the heart, giving rise in the mind of the sufferer to the idea that he has heart trouble. Nothing could be further from correct. Most supposed heart trouble is nothing more nor less than indigestion. Of course that is serious enough but you want to know where the seat of the trouble is, so you can treat it properly. Again, such food as should be digested in the stomach but is not digested there, passes into the intestines and bowels where it causes more trouble. The bowels become constipated or "clogged up", the waste matter is not passed off but is to some extent absorbed back in the system. This poisons the blood. Then what can you expect? Can any person think that this poisoned blood can make healthy flesh.healthy bone, healthy kidneys, healthy liver, healthy heart, or a clear, healthy, active brain? Is it any wonder that ninety five per cent of the American people have bodily afflictions? The whole point is this. If people would digest their food properly most human ills would disappear. You no doubt would cure your Indigestion if you knew how, wouldn't you? Certainly. Now if the digestive juices or fluids are lacking but we substitute something com posed of exactly the same elements or in gredients, isn't it common sense that the result will be the same? If a certain combination of elements will complete ly digest food in a glass tube or in a bottle, under proper conditions, isn't it common sense that the same elements will digest the food in the stomach? Of course It is; it can't help it. Several years were expended in perfecting a preparation that would do this very thing. The result was Kodol Dyspepsia Cure. It contains every element necessary to the complete and per fect digestion of all classes of food. It permits you to eat all the good food you want and digest every particle of it without any atdf whatever from the stomach, allow ing the digestive organs to rest aDd regain their normal healthy condition and strength. By digesting all you eat, Kodol Dyspepsia Cure tones up the entire system. It will give you life, health, strength, ambition, a good appetite, sound, healthful sleep and pure, rich blood that will enable nature to correct many ills to which the other organs of your body may be subject. Kodol Dyspepsia Cure never fails to cure dyspepsia, indigestion and stomach troubles, even after all other medicines have failed. Can there be any possible reason why it will not cure you? (Saniiiil IHlea.pt t Heapf . TaOiis. Dear Sirs: I had suffered for years with stomach trouble and after doctoring with several doctors who did me no good and af ter being in bed three weeks at' one time when I could eat nothing, and my heart troubled me and ached so at times that I thought I was going to die, a friend recom mended your Kodol Dyspepsia Cure. After I began taking the first bottle, I commenced to Improve at once and my apnetite began to improve. Now after taking'two bottles, I am so that I can eat anything and every thing. I cannot recommend too highly the Kodol Dyspepsia Cure to all sufferers with stomach trouble and indigestion, and would say to all that if you will only try it, you will be cured as I am now, after having spent hundreds of dollars with doctors and Getting no better, while a few bottles of Ko ol Dyspepsia Cure made me well. Tours most respect fully, Mrs. Julia Hursh, Butte des Morts, Wis. Dear Sirs: It gives me great pleasure to write you concerning the good qualities of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure. I had a stomach trouble of four years standing, which was so bad at times I was forced to abandon business and remain in bed. I had tried physicians and all k!nd3 of dyspepsia tablets in vain. At last through the recommendation of my druggist I tried a bottle of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure. The ef fect was highly gratifying, as I received im mediate relief and less than two bottles ef fected a complete cure. I never travel without a bottle of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure in my valise. It does the work quickly and thoroughly and I cannot say too much in its praise. Yours truly Geo. E. Colbath, Alpena, Mich. Luke J. Collins of East Windsor, New York deposes and says that he has been troubled with dyspepsia for two years, having acidity of the stomach (heartburn) and indigestion so that he took no comfort from eating any kind of food, but after having tried prescriptions from several physicians with out any permanent relief, by taking two bottles of Kodol Dyspepsia Cure he appears to be cured.

FOR OLD TELEGRAPHERS. - fN. Photo by Throbeck & Rundle, Denver, Colo.J Miss Grace Whitworth, the Dodge City Oirl Seen in "Sporting Life." There are few plays that come to Topeka in which Kansas is not repre sented in the cast and "Sporting Life," a clean play with a repulsive name, was no exception to the rule. ' Grace Whitworth, who played "Nora Cavanaugh" in "Sporting Life," is a Kansas girl. She is the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. H. Whitworth of Dodge City. Miss Whitworth has been in New York for the past three years studying for the stage. She spent two years at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, which is in connection with the E.-npire theater. New Tork, and controlled by theFrohmans. This is Miss Whitworth' first season on the road and although she says she is well pleased with the leading juvenile part in "Sporting Life" she prefers more quiet and romantic parts. Her ideal actress is Julia Marlowe and her hope is to be like her. . Miss Whitworth is a particularly pleasing and winsome young woman and her work on the stage is an index to her gentleness of character. If genuine sporting life has no better support than the five act melo drama its decline will be hasty. Only a fragment of an audience braved the first touch of winter to see the play fairly well given. There are a few strong characters in the production. The part Olive de Carteif t an English society swell, impressed one with the disgusting way in which a woman by the practice of guile can wrap half a dozen men around her finger at the same time. It was represented by Lillian Lamson. Lord Woodstock, the hero of it all, gets into and out of more scrapes than is scarcely possible in real life. Nora Cavanaugh, who figures as the youngest of all the lovers was well carried out by Grace Whitworth. Other parts were well supported. The horses were real but there was not much of a suggestion' of a capering race in their docile movements around over the floor, probably because tbere wasn't room. Carnegie Has Another Flan For Spending Some Money. New Tork, Dec. 5. Andrew Carnegie has under consideration the gift of a large sum of money to be used for the benefit of the aged telegraphers in this section of the country, and it is said that he intends, when satisfactory plans have been made, to extend his charitable bequest so as to include the telegraphers in all parts of the land. The above announcement appears jn today's Journal and American, and it will also contain a letter written re cently to a Pittsburg man, in which Mr. Carnegie says he would be glad to contribute to a fund for aged teleg raphers. The propositions which Mr. Carnegie has in mind ara the establishment of a combination club and hospital, a gen eral pension fund and the founding of an Arcadia in New Jersey. Mr. Car negie is said to favor the Arcadia idea. This includes the establishment of a town, with lots and houses to be sold at the maximum of $2,500 each. Rent als are fixed according to this plan at $15 per month, and the interest alone or 2 per cent, to go to the general fund. Libraries and co-operative stores are to be established in which everything is to be given to telegraphers at cost. HIGHEST POINT REACHED. Present Prices Have Not Been Equaled Since the Sixties. New Tork, Dec. 5. Dun's index nurn ber, to be issued December 7, will say: If a man purchased his supplies for one year on December 1 they would have cost $101.37, while the same quantities of the same articles would have aggre gated $72.45 on July 1. 1897, the lowest point on record, and $121.75 on January 1, 1860. These price records are com piled by multiplying the quotations of all the necessaries of life by the per capita consumption. Prices are now at the highest point in many years, and in fact surpass ail records since present improved methods of manufacture and distribution have been in use and agri cultural operations were first begun on the present extensive scale with labor saving machinery. BUCkLIN HAS 

ENOUGH. Anti Trust Legislator Beady to Re tire on His Laurels. J. A. Bucklin, of Thomas county, who led the fight against the grain trust in the last legislature, does not think he will return to the legislature of 1903. "The majority of the voters in the People's party," he said, "are against continuing a man in office more than two terms as a rule, while I have al ready served three terms in the legis lature, and I surely would not ask for a fourth term. Besides that, there is nothing in the job financially." Mr. Bucklin is opposed to the Popu list party going into the Democratic ranks. "When it comes time for action the mass of the people will hold a delegate convention and decide upon what they want to do," said Mr. Bucklin. "No body can tell just what it will be, but the rank and file of the People's party will not go into the Democratic party at least under its present leadership." A 

TRAGIC SUICIDE. Michigan Man Shoots Out His Brains in a Tree Top. Detroit, Mich.. Dec 6. A special to the Tribune from Holland, Mich., says: Nelson Culver, during a fit of tempor ary insanity, ran away from his home at Hamilton and climbed to the top of a tall tamarack tree. When he saw his friends at the foot of the tree trying to rescue him he pulled a revolver and blew out his brains. His body dropped to the lower branches of the tree about 50 feet from the ground and dangled there while his lifeblood ebbed away. MUST HAVE LOWER DUTY. General Wood Continues to Plead the Cause of Cuba. Washington, Dec. 5. Gen. Leonard Wood, military governor of Cuba, ac companied by his secretary and Gon zales Quesada, was at the capitol today conferring with senators in the interest of Cuban reciprocity. General Wood told the senators that some measure of reciprocity on Cuban sugar and tobacco, particularly the former, is essential to giving the isl and that degree of stability and pros perity which was contemplated when the United States dispossessed Spanish rule. Concerning the renewed reports from Havana that General Maso's friends complain that the United States influence is being exerted in favor of Estrada Palma's candidacy, General Wood says that every care is being taken to avoid such influence, the exist ence of which he believes to be much over estimated. SAW AGUINALDO. Congressman Weeks Gives Im pression of Ex-Leader. GOVERNOR STANLEY BALKS Mr. Byerson Ritchie Interferes With McKinley Monument Plans. There are breakers ahead of the Mc Kinley memorial monument fund in Kansas. An individual by the name of Ryerson Ritchie, of Cleveland, Ohio, 13 breaking in upon Governor Stanley's plans, and the whole enterprise may yet be wrecked. Ritchie is secretary of the McKinley Monument association, and after Governor Stanley has been requested to take charge of the move ment in Kansas and has started out to raise possibly double the quota assign ed to Kansas, he finds that Ritchie has been working along another line, trying to raise the money in Kansas through the postmasters. "Too many cooks spoil the broth," said the governor when he made the discovery, "and too many heads to the Kansas end of the monument project will kill it. Either Ryerson or I will have to quit, and I have written him so. I guess he is drawing a salary for his services and he wants to earn it." Governor Stanley has been sending out letters to school superintendents and others in order to interest the school children in the movement. He desired to have a special McKinley pro gramme rendered in the schools on January 29, the birthday of both Mc Kinley and Kansas. He has received replies to some of these letters telling him of what Ritchie has done. WON'T TALK OF DEPUTIES. San Francisco, Deo. 5.

He is not an intelligent man, and I think feels that he is inferior in in telligence to the Americans. He seemed to me not clever, but cunning. The gen eral opinion among the military men is that Aguinaldo should be allowed to es cape. He is a dead issue and no longer a menace to the United States. It is sup posed that he does not want to run away, as he would at once be assassinated by the friends of Oeneral Luna, whom he or dered to be killed. "The new method of educating the na tives as adopted by this government, is wrong. Refined, handsome young ladies from "Vassar and other colleges went down to the Philippines to educate these natives. They have had to put up with all kinds of privations and to eat native food, and in some places their lives have been in danger. I think this is entirely unnecessary. In place of these young ladies, discharged soldiers of education who had become acclimated, should be appointed and the ladies sent home.
