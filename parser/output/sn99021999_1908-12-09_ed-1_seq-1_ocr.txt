NEW TORK( Dec. .-The New Tork World, to which Delaran Bmlth. editor of the Indianapolis News, referred In his re ply to President Roosevelt's attack upon him. as the authority for the article on the Panama canal which appeared In his papers and railed forth tbe president's letter, says today: '"In rlew of President Rooeevelt'a delib erate misstatement or fact In hia scand alous personal attack upon Mr. Delavan Smith, editor of tha Indianapolis News, the World calls upon the congress of the Vnlted States to make Immediately a full and Impartial Investigation of the entire Panama canal scandaL The Investigation of 190S by the senate committee of the tnter-oceanlc canals was blocked by tha refusal of William Nelson Cromwell to answer the moat pertinent u '' ns of . mator gan f Jibama.

There Is no doubt that the government paid $4O,W0,0 tor the prop erty. But who got the money r "President Roosevelt's reply to this most proper question Is for the most part a stirring of abusive and defamatory epithets. But he also makes the following statements aa truthful Information to tbe American people: " The United States did not pay a cent of the 140.000.000 to any American citizen. The government paid the

World Ketaraa Compliment. "To the best of the World's knowledge and belief each and all of these statements made by Mr. Roosevelt and quoted above are untrue and Mr. Roosevelt must have known they were when he made them. "As to the detailed distribution of the Panama loot only one man knows It alL And that man la William Nelson Cromwell. Tatf two men who wtre most In Mr. Crom well s confidence are Theodore Roosevelt, president of the Vnlted Ststes, and Ellhu Itoot, former secretary of war and now secretary of state. It waa they who aided Mr. Cromwell In consummating the Panama revolution, arranged the terms of the pur chase of the Panama canal. made the agreement to pay 140,000,000 on the canal properties and an additional JIO.000,000 for a manufactured Panama republic, every penny of both of which sums was paid by check oft the Vnlted States treasury to J. P. Morgan Co. not to the French gov ernment, aa Mr. Roosevelt ssys, but to J. P. Morgan Co." The World tiien goes extensively into evidence brought out at the senate investi gation by Senator Morgan In 1 and says: "Mr. Cromwell applied to the canal situa tion the methods of American high finance by which a syndicate takes over the prop erty of a bankrupt concern, then createa a holding company and a recapitalization, keeping the majority control tn a syndicate trusteeship." It then continues: "Following that, to quote from Mr. Crom well's testimony, 'In May. 1H.

In the sfternoon County Attorney English will close for the state, probably taking the rest of the day. At the close of his ad dress Judge Sears will read the instruc tions, which will require a half hour, and then the fa'e of Charles E. Davis will be put Into the hands of the twelve -Jurors. . J. W. Woodrough. Dsvis' Junior counsel. scted out before the Jury In a dramatic manner one theory of the way Dr. Rustin might have come to his death. Taking a seat In front of he Jurors with the re volver which served as an exhibit In the case In his hand, Mr. Woodrough went through the motions of shooting himself In the abdomen, at the same time graph ically describing to the'Jurors the way Dr. Rustin probably sat tn the steamer chair on his front porch that fatal morning and thought over hia misdeeds. Weedreigk Exploits Satelde Theory. After declaring the defense did not hava to work out any theory of how Dr. Rustin was shot, the attorney pointed out alleged weak spots In Mrs. Rice's alibi and de clared no reasoning man could aay that Charles E. Davis and not Mrs. Rice shot Dr. Rustin. He deprecated the theory that Dr. Rustin waa thinking about his Insur ance and his family bees use he had let S35.OQ0 in incontestlble Insurance lapse a few weeks before his death. After calling attention to the dissolute life led by Dr. Rustin after his attentions to Abble Rica bexsji, Mr. Woodrough continued: "As he sat there In that steamer chair what thoughts must have come to his mind, thoughts that life was not worth living. He, perhaps, took the gun out of his pocket and looked at it. He held It in hia hands propped up on his knees pointed toward his abdomen. He pulled the trig ger and the deed was done. Then Is when he began to think of his wife and chil dren. It la then he thinks of his Insur ance. Then In that moment when his wife finds him propped up In that chair wounded she hss him to herself. If she says. They'll get nothing out of me what man could blame her. "If one of ua were found wounded on the front porch of his home by his wife, in iri ml vuu-j le crj tt ttaaif.r. i4ry murder" would have sounded down the street. If be said 'A man shot me.' there were reasons, good reasons why -that cry did not ring out that night." Mr. Woodrough declared a heavy man like Davis could not hava left tha front porch of Dr. Rustin without extracting tbe attention of Martin Meyer, whe waa In the room of the next house. Only a light, nimble woman, be aaid, could have gotten away without attracting attention if any one could. Wltaesa Dlsaatea Mrs. Allea. The chief witness In rebuttal of Mrs. Allen, who testified she saw Mrs. Abble Rice, the state's witness at Sixteenth and Farnam streets at 4 o'clock, waa Mrs. Mar garet Anderson, to whom Mrs. Allen swore she told the incident of seeing Mrs. Rice. Mra Anderson declared Mrs. Allen had never told her about the Incident and had only , told her she knew Dr. Rustin. Other evidence was offered to show that Mra. Allen had worked In a bouse of assig nation on Tenth street. Four verdicts are possible In the ease. The Jury may find for the defendant or may find him guilty of either first degree or second degree murder or manslaughter. County Attorney English had evidently Improved the opportunity overnight of working up hia case In rebuttal, for he had a number of witnesses on hand before court opened. Mrs. Etta L. Allen, the sensational wit ness tor the defense, was first called to me cnair ror further cross-examination by the county attorney. Mra. Allen admitted she had done some work for Mra Lovett and that Mrs. Lovett's principal business waa making dresses for women of bad cnaracter. Dut she denied making any salea for Mra, Lovett to such women. She also admitted she had worked for Bertha Huscn in a rooming house on Tenth street. one denied knowing it was a house of as signation and said Miss Busch had told her "a thousand times" It was a straight place. It was brought out that Stella Jones, another wltneas In the case and a maid at Clara Gleuaon's resort, waa work ing at the Busch place. Mrs. Allen became indignant when Mr. English asked her if she did not formerly run a "place" over the Hde bouse tn Lin coln, and he changed tha objectionable word to "rooming house," She aald ahe ran one over the Booth Packing company store. "Didn't Officer Bentley of Lincoln order you to leave town?" "He never did at any time," she an swered indignantly. Maaraey Cea trad lets Her. George A. Magney, deputy county attor ney, was the first witness in rebuttal He said Mrs. Allen had told him about seeing a woman at Sixteenth and Farnam streets on the morning of the murder and ahe said after learning of the developments of the ! murder that It must be Mrs. Rica He de- ; clared she did not tell hlra she knew the woman waa Mrs. Rice or that she had I ever seen the woman before. Mrs. Allen's testimony also brought Mra. Abble Rice hack to the witness stand. 8 he denied being on Farnam street at the time Mra. Allen aald she saw her or of buying 1 a paper there. Mrs. Allen described her ' wear-In m ( tit with I hanging down behind it. Mra. Rice said tbe did not wear a bat with any drapery on. She also denied Frank Salyarda' testi mony that he had aeen her standing at Fortieth and Farnam streets at 1:10 that morning. 8he aald ahe had no wrap or coat, as he had testified, but ahe had an umbrella, some books and some pictures of Dr. Rustin she wanted because of the associations. salyard A gala Hit.

The polke investi gators, take the other view, declaring that there was no evidence of the presence of the Intruder at the home. A trail of blood stains on the snow white stairway leading from the reception hall on the first floor indicate that Mr. Hlrsch berg was shot at the foot of these stairs and then turned over and walked back to his bedroom on the second floor. - From there he crossed a hallway and passed through his wife's room to the bath room. As he returned, stacgering into his wife's room, Mrs. Hlrschberg awoke Just In time to see hlra sink to the floor unconscious. according to statements made to the police. Mrs. Hlrschberg had her husband carried to his bedroom, where he died. He made no statement aa to how he waa shot. So far as the police could learn no member of the household wa on the lower floor. It was explained that deafness of long stand ing prevented Mrs. Hlrschberg from hear ing the report of the revolver.

MEET AGAIN IN OMAHA FRIDAY Mar Possibly "elect a SsereHsr to Chaarellor Aidrrwi at that Time -More Reports of State InstltatloaB. 'From a"etaff Correspondent.) LINCOLN. Dec. a (SroiaL) At a meeting of the members of the Board of Regents of the State university arid the members of the Slate Board of Education last night, the matter of finances for the schools was one of the questions discussed. After a talk by State Treasurer Brian on the matter of school tax, the regents finally agreed to ask the next legislature for the usual 1-mlll levy, but specify that when 95 per cent of the tax levied should be collected that would be the limit of ths appropriation. The regents, figuring on past experience, estimate that 95 per cent of the tax Is col lected. On a valuation of $."31,000,000 in rund numbers this would produce STlS.TtO for the blennlum on the 1-mill levy. So the university would ssk for this sum out of the 1-mlll levy. In his talk Treasurer Brian advocated a specific appropriation for. the university rather than the 1-mlll levy, and he as sured the regents that there waa no use apologizing for the sum necessary to con duct the university and normal schools. It was his idea that when the people knew Just how small an amount it meant to the Individual taxpayer to support these schools they would make no objections to the specific expropriation, but that at this time they did object to the uncertainty of tho amount the 1-mill levy would raise. At the present time the property owner whose property is assessed at IjuO, pays 10 cents a year for the support of the uni versity; t,V pays 30 cents a year; 10.000 pays t2 a year, and flOCi.OOO pays $J0 a year. Five hundred dollars pays 34 cents to the support of the normal schools each year. S1.000 pays 7 cents. SlO.uOO pays 70 cents and JlW.Ono jsys fl to the support of the normal school. The BOird of Regents of the State unl vers'ty will meet In Omaha next Friday.

It Is probable Regen.s Whltmore and Coupland will remain In Omaha throughout the show. While It Is not probable It is barely pos sible that a chancellor of tho university will be selected at the Omaha meeting. So far. however, this matter has been dis cussed very little between the board mem ters and no committee on chancellor haa been appointed, yet circumstances may bo shape themselves that the new chancellor may be named at the Friday meeting.
