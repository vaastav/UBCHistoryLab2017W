IMPORTANT.A lady was disapoint ecl the first time she used DeLand's Chemical Baking Powder. Her baking was yellow. The trouble was, she did not allow for the extra strength, which makes only about one-half the quantity necesary. She learned her mistake and now declares it to be the best she ever used. Aie not the ladies of New Ulm go ing to "receive" on New Year's day? Theie aie quite a number of young gentlemen in this city that would like to see the question answered af firmatively. ii At the Cong. Church, cor.

An exchange says that a meeting has been held to devise ways and means for draining Swan Lake. This is one of the largest lakes in inne sota. Who the parties are that pro pose this gigantic drainage scheera, report does not say. The whole St. Peter Tribune and Journal forces are looking for the Yankee gill who, it is said, came on from New Hampshire to marry one of -St. Peter's rich bachelors. So far the search has been unsuccessful, and the Tribune pronounces the whole thing a hoax. The President's message was deA livered to Congress on the fourth inst. It is an able, business like document and receives the commendations of the leading papers in the country. A supplement accompanies this issue of the 

REVIEW giving the message in its entirety, At the meeting of the Minnesota Valley Medical Association in Man kito, last week, Dr. C. Berry of this city was elected first vice president of the society for the ensuing year. Dr. F. Welcome, of Granite Falls, was elected a member. The next meeting of the society will be held at Le Sueur. Lute Ives rises to remark: I must say that the old story of the crucifix ion of Christ in effigy at New Ulm is, in my opinion, a humbug, as I was in the immediate vicinity of New Ulm at the lime, and never heaidof it until I saw it in some religious Boston paper several months after the Indian out break." Some physicians ascribe the pre valence of diphtheiia at the present day laigeiv to badly trimmed, smoky kerosene lamps, which are sometimes left burning in the chambers all night, turned down low, filling the room with their poisonous fumes in con nection with the fetid atmospheie of ill-ventilated aiiartments. There is no need ot anyone going or sending elsewheio for a nice Christ mas or New Year's present. Our mer chants have amply provided tor both old and young, and their prices are as low as the lowest. If you wish to place your money where it will do the most good for all concerned, patronize home institutions. The Lyon County News says its in formant of the doings in the early days at New Ulm "is a lespected man. and one esteemed by and inteiested in om own people." Now if the Ntivs m foim.mt will come right out and tell UL' all ho knows about that "effigy" he will do our people, in whom he is so much interested, a great favor. Some young "gentlemen" amused themselves last Sunday night by throwing stones through the win dows in Helman's residence, Hoin burg's machine agency ollice, Schno brich's and Brust's saloons. This sort of thing is getting to be a nuisance to the most patient oE our people, and it is about time a lesson was taught some one. After 

IJOI ing to a depth of 98 feet without finding water, the laihoad company has concluded that thei is more moistuie neaier the suiface of the ground and a force of workmen are now engaged near the Empire mill in excavating for a reservoir. Quite a nice stieain of water runs past the reservoir and this is to be utilized, provided the Eagle Mill folks will in terpose no objection. %*"Mean people take advantage of their neighbor's difficulties to annoy them." Mean diseases, such as piles, rhuematism, constipation, dyspepsia, malaria, lame backs, etc., take advan tage of people's exposures and attack them. It is then that Kidney-Wort appears on the field and by its timely agency puts to rout this flock of evil ailments. I is a friend in need and therefore a friend indeed. JVi? ii mi, i,^, The Tracy Trumpet says that Mr. Scbell has purchased the ice-house and ice, formerly belonging to Law rence Strait & Co. He will fill this building and the Hartigan ice-house this winter, and next summer, run an ice wagon. Mr. Schell is also sole agent for the sale of the celebrated Eagle Mill flour. Herman Seiter's 09 cent store is doing a thriving busi ness, we understand. Our New UlmSchwerzler boys are making their mark in Tra cy. From the report of the State Super intendent of Public Instructions it ap pears that Brown county has 3,144Reck scholars entitled to the apportion ment, and 93 not entitled to appor* lionmenb.

City Clerk Nix gives notice in an other column of a citizens' meeting, to be held at 0 o'clock this evening in Turner Hall. The call does not speci fy the object of the meeting, but we understand that tho city treasury has bcome depleted and that the meeting is called for the purpose of authoriz ing a loan of $4,000. Three thous and dollars of this amount has already been expended on street improve ments, the money having been ad vanced by the Citizens Bank, and the balance is needed for the payment of one of tho outstanding city bonds, which will mature shortly. Other matters may come up for considera tion, but the present condition of our city finances will be the main subject for discussion. E --^7^^^r*-^^^i* We are in receipt of copies of The Philadelphia Weekly Press and terms for 1884. The Press is unquestiona bly one of the best Republican news papers in the country, and deserves a patronage of all who want a first-class weekly. We will have copies of the Weekly Press at the 

REVIEW for in spection, or you may obtain a sample copy free by sending a postal card request to The Press, Philadelphia, Pa.

Nat ional Guard during the coming year. committee of the most influential business men was appointed to confer with Mayor Ludwig and the city council and solicit their co-operation in the matter. The Winona people have gone to work in this matter in a business like manner. Waseca and Faribault are also moving in the mat ter. The question will be decided at a meeting of the officers of the regiment to be held at Mankato January 0th. Commenting on the proposition to have Col. Tim Sheehan, ex-Sherlffof Freeborn county, appointed to the po sition of Adjutant General, the Pio neer Press gets off the following "good one" on Col. Tim: An old story and a good one can be told of Sheehan. He was afresh lieu tenant in command of raw recruits at Fort Ridgely when that post was be sieged by the Sioux in 1862. Capt. Marsh, his superior, was slain with a score of men while on the way from the fort to the relief of the Lower Agency. Lieut. Sheehan announced the death of Capt Marsh at parade on the day the news reached the fort. "Now," said he, when the sad fact was duly stated, "let us give three groans for the brave dead!" Victory would have called for cheers. Death to Sheehan's Hibernian mind, deserved groans. The whole company, under his Bashan-hke lead, gave three such howls as would have lifted the hair on the heads of Capt Marsh and his brave men, had any been left there by their slayeis.
