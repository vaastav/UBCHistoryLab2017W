and the Senate that the House a ready fo business and wound up by indulging in the biennial lottery of the seat drawing contest Speaker Reed was beyond question the star of the o sion His appearance was the signal for a most flattering and enthu siastic demonstration His inaugural was modest and full of good feeling but noncommittal a to policies How eer it was not expected that the speaker would ttouch upon questions to be dealt with by the House ExSpeaker Crisp assumed the > leadership ership of the minority and it was sig nificant that Mr Payne of New York mage the motion which usually de raves upon the leader of the majority Tnis is taken to mean that he is t be chairman of the Ways and Means committee and the recognized leader of the Republicans on the floor The Proceedings By 10 oclock the marole corridors of the hal of representatives were thronged wIt sight seers and place hunters and before 1 oclock the gal leries public and private were packed to the doors From the

was deafening Above this volume of sound came like pistol shots cries of Reed Reed Reed The Republicans cheered many of them wildly and the ladies in the gallery waved handkerchiefs For over a minute the demonstration continued Mr Reed arrayed in a long frock cat and wearing a dark fourinhand tie stood calmly and serenely with his haoids clasped in characteristic fashion behind his back until the House was I quiet S Mr Harmer Republican of Penn I sylvania the oldest member in contin uous service present came forward and I administered the ouith of office to the speaker The latter then turned to the house Looking into the sea of upturned faces he delivered his in augural Slowly and distinctly the words fell from his lips At many places his brief speech was punctuated with applause His Speech l will not be unbecoming in me I hope if I acknowledge t this assembly that it is very agreeable to me to stand I once more in the Pace I left four years ago Of the past however I shall not I speak for the past speak for itself in terms more fitting and appropriate than any words which could come from I my lips Nor shall I speak of the fu ture for we are not putting off the harness but putting it on Yet I think I may venture to say of the future in the light of the past that if we do something which for the moment seems inadequate it may be that time which has justified itself for ha just1ed us on so many occasions may do so again I Those who have acted with wisdom heretofore may be fairly expected to act with wisdom hereafter I SI am sorry to say the pleasure as sociated with the honor you have be stowed upon me am honor nO Ameri can citizen can fail to appreciate and for which I give thanks is but for a mo ment or so while the cares and respon sibilities extend over many days So far a the performance of my duties affects the whole people o the United States I invoke their considerate judg ment So far a it affects the members of this House I ask from bothsides of the chamber that cordial cordil coopera I tion without which I cannot hope to succeed assuring them that no effort on my part will be spared to aid them in the performance of their duties by that entire impartiality which is their just due At the conclusion of his speech the members came forward in squads a their names were called and with up liftsd arms swore to support and de fend the constitution against all ene mies foreign and domestic and faith fully discharge the duties of their of fice This proceeding occupied over half an hour Unanimous consent was given that Mr Newlands of Nevada and

formers motion that the rules of the Fiftyfirst Congress be adopted for the guidance of the Hyase Mr Cannon and Mr Dingley explain ed that the House was without rules and that the adoption of the proffered motion would furnish only temporary rules for the guidance of the House I until the committee on rules reported Mr Crisp withdrew his opposition I and the motion was carried Biennial Lottery

or hinder the work of re storing order the powers again appear unanimously resolved to insist upon the demand for extra guardships In consequence the ambassadors have ar ranged for a meeting tomorrow Mon day to consider what action is neces sary in view of the sultans continued objection to granting the firmans Meanwhile the impression is being conveyed to the public that the sultan has won a great victory This tends to make the matter more delicate to handle as to demonstrate that such rs not the case is almost certain to lead I to an outbreak even more serious than the one which gave a pretext for the demand for extra guardships A Turkish official discussing the withdrawal of the Dryad intimated that the powers objected to any power taking the lead in any action in Tur key In other words if action is to be taken it should be a combined action upon the part of the powers Thus it is Intimated that if the passage of the Dardanelles is to be forced it should be done by the warships of all the powers interested This was the orig inal understanding but Great Britain it appears was not disposed to delay matters beyond a certain point An other diplomat said it looked as if Great Britain had attained the object she had in view namely to show the sultan and the powers as well that while being desirous of acting in ac cord with the other powers her majestys government was prepared to act alone if a necessity should arise and if the powers desired concerted ac ton they must act promptly or Great Britain will take the initiative The socalled firing upon the British ship Loch Rannoch in theDardanelles is said by Turkish officials to be easily explained They say Loch Rannoch arrived after sundown and instead of anchoring attempted to proceed and was signalled from

NEW YORK Dec 2A dispatch to the Herald from Vienna says The ambassador of a great power said to a correspondent last night The first thing to be done is to strengthen the position of the sultan as the
