If il Governor-General Bissing let the cat out of the bag- when he stated that the Belgians were being deported in order that "the fewest possible Germans (might) be with drawn from our front lines to watch over Belgium;" favorable action on the United States protest against the practice would herefore seem a possibility very remote. -As long as Germany attempted to pal- iate her actions on economic grounds, there was a chance that she might bf brought to see the error o fher ways. But we now know it is not that the Belgians aren i worKin, u is mai uic uennans nccu The Germans were so severely workers ; it IS not that there IS nothipg f or I trounced on the Somme that they are me ueigians to ao in tneir native country, -e m .

Honest now, was that girl who bet some kisses on Hughes sorry he lost? Tampa is boycotting the eggs. Tampa knows a good thing when it sees it. GREETINGS. Welcome to Florida, Oh, Kentucky Hunting Party; welcome ' .to the Happy Hunting Grounds! When we think of the playfur trout and the driving quail and the dainty squirrel and the unassuming doves and the stal wart bear and the curving deer that will be yours, we have visions of the days when we fared forth in quest of game in other climes and came back empty-handed not havng the advantages which you have. We hope you will like our country as much as our people like your methods- This isn't a land selling excursions we know you have splendid and well establish- ed farms back in Kentucky, . here the julep beds are giving way to pasturage, and we know that you do .not contemplate giving them up but we would like to have you stay with us! 'Hie stories that Eubanks and Godfrey and Jennings and all the rest brought back show that you are the right sort. . . ' But tell your friends about West Flor ida; grub-stake your poorer relatives to a claim in pur' virgin opportunity; help your foremen who are thinking of branchings out for themselves, to establish themselves in what we are pleased to call God's coun-. try and hope you will do the same. Don't Jell them too much about our climate It has been overdone. We don't want sick people; we don't want quitters we don't want hardship dodgers. We want the strongest and bravest and most capable men in the country that's why we take such pleasure in welcoming you; that's the message we ask you to take back to Ken tucky when you have studied the work and play of Sunshine Land. . THE MARINA EXPLANATION. Germany has acknowledged torpedoing the Marina a fact we knew already! and has made indirect offer of reparation for the six Americans who were lost which is the very least that could have been ex pected. The Marina, it will be remembered, was trie vessel which was sunk without warn ing just on the eve of our election. That President Wilson did not make political capital out of an opportunty, at a time when he was most bitterly assailed for his peaceful, just methods, to take a truculent stand, solidify the country back of him, and as.ure his flection, then gravely in doubt, even if the price was war, is in accord with onr traditions of internationalism ; and Germany has given abundant proof subse quently of an apparently sincere desire to lespect neutral and non-belligerent rights at least so far as pertains to the United States. But the Teutonic explanation that the Marina was sunk without warnincr because the U-boat commander "thought" it .was a transport, while it is friendly, is not enough,4 nor can any amount of blood money, bring the dead Americans back to life. The German commander should have krown; his half-cock eagerness to loose the engines of destruction against innocent men simply proves that he is unfit for serv ice, and the least the United States can ex pect is that he be reduced from his com- rr.and. President Wilson has already spoken of the intolerable position of the neutral a -fact which is urging us to establish the League to Enforce Peace, and uphold its police powers with a strong army and a. mighty fleet; in the meantime, President Wilson must insrst that no vessel be tor pedoed without warning, whether neutral or enemy, not a ship of war. President Wilson has invited Bryan to take a lunch, with him. and the country is wondering whether any plums will be served for dessert. Linotype operators will learn to their horror that Count Szeptycki has been appointed commander in the Polish army. it is that the Germans need soldiers on their battlefields. Every thousand Belgians deported means that the army of occupation can be creased just that much; and the substitu tion of Belgian laborers for German means that the trenches .will be filled, as the say ing is, coming and going. A hundred thou sand Belgians have to date been torn from their homes, and the outrage is being con- union sf 1 fV. . , . . , . . . . .

THAT CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. , Of course you are going to dc that Christmas shopping early that's the fashion nowadays, and fashion is a good tiiiner to tollow. even when its amis are humanitarian and not selfish. Time was, and not so long ago, that the stores advertised the lure of shopping by night. Our scrap book yields up the yA that the old-fashioned fellow who used to wait at the church door after preaching and invite everybody to take dinner with him, now stays home to curse' the high cost of living; and the old-fashioned foot stamping ora tor refrains because of the high cost of leather.

Hiatt, Jackson county's new farm demonstration agent, is a live wire. That he is going to prove the right man in the right place is the belief of all who have taken note of the way he is taking hold of things.--Marianna Times-Courier. It Will Pay With the present shortage of food stuff there is no doubt but that Santa Rosa county farmers will be able to sell every article of food that they can produce in the next twelve months at a good price. With this fact settled there is no reason why every farmer in the county should not make his plans to raise a crop of things to eat. It will pay. Milton Gazette. Jobs Waiting Seventy-five thousand of the 250. 000 students in the institutions of higher learning of the United States are studying agriculture, according to President A. A. Murphree of the University of Florida. This means that 75,000 persons have keen fore sight. There is room for still others because more than 100,000 agricul tural jobs are waiting for this army of students. Punta Gorda Herald. Why Blood Impurities Show In the Skin .
