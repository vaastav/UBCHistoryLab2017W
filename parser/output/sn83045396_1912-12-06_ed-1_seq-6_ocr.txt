Possibly it is accounted for on the basis that they are "wiggly aldermen." It cost upwards of a million dollars to elect Governor "Wilson In bo Presi i dent. But according to Col.

TATT ON RIVER IMPROVEMENTS. ! J'rc.siilont Taft has put himself de cidedly on tho right' Hide of tho 'Mis sissippi rjver improvement proposition. ITo is in Tavor of tho appropriation of .130,000,000 to control tho floods in ; tho great river which were 3o disas trous last year, and which are a con stant thruat of destruction, llo inform ed tho National liivova and Haru'ors Congress, iu session at Washington, that the prevention of floods was tho great thing with him, and thnt this miiPt bo put boforo all other considera tions, and further, that his endorse ment of the improvements would be forthcoming only, if the work were placed iD tho hands of army engineers. So far as other waterway projects wore concerned, he said his approval would be lacking unless their backers could show as good a case and as dire a necessity as could the Mississippi Val ley States, and he expressed his idea that .50,000,000 was the proper sum to start with in- procuring the needed protection. In thus placing himself at the head of this great propaganda, President Taft has done tho whole country an immonso service. It -will be easy enough to show, as ho aakg to bo shown, that tho improvement of other rivors Tvill be the best and most per manent means of proventiug tho de structive floods on the lowor Mississ ippi. If tho flood waters can be hold back in the Ohio and tho Missouri, and their upper tributaries and m the upper tributaries of the Mississippi it self, tho floods can be eliminated to such an extont that they will no longer be dangerous, and the. impounding ot the 'flood waters of those tributaries will serve tho further purpose of re enforcing tho channel later ou in the season, when additional water is de sirable to make a zood depth of channel for navigation. It is to be expected that this grand proicct must bo the next great enter prise undertaken by our National Gov ernment. That it would be an eco nomic advantage fully justifying ilsch, there can be no doubt, for the de struction by floods along tho Ohio river every year amounts to millions of dol lars, and in some years to tens of mil lions. The floods in the Ohio and (he lower Mississippi, last spring caused loss well along toward tho sum fixed hy the' President as desirable to expend in the improvement of the Mississippi. But as stated, ir. is not tho Mississippi alone that has to be improved, and, further, thnt improve ment of the Mississippi will depend for its effectiveness upon tho handliug of the tributary streams above the Ohio, the Missouri, and tho uppor Mississippi. Along tho headwaters of the Ohio river there arc immeusc gorges where the flood waters could bo stored away and held until they are needed later in the season, aud thus tho destruction by spring floods wholly prevented. The same thing is true of the upper Mis sissippi, and in even greater degree on tho tributaries and headwaters of the Missouri. With the flood waters of that immense area impounded, there would be assured safety from spring floods aud abundance of water to make a good navigable channel in tho main streams at all times when the rivers are froe from ice. it is Tiot too .much to say that the endorsement by President Taft of these great river improvements (for we consider that all must go together in any effective National scheme) will be the stroko of statesmanship for which President Taft's namo will chiefly be honored in later generations. 

CANADIAN IMPORTUNITY. Canada always has a koon eyo to her own provincial interests. It will be re membered that in order to obtain ac cess to the northern Pacific ocean. Can ada insisted that when in our treaty with liussia at the time of the pur chase of Alaska, the boundaries wero described as sinuous, and following the course of tide water, running ton miles removed therefrom, that meant a straight lino drawn from point to point, which would give Canada as mauy ports as she liked on tho inlets from tho sea. But the English judge whose voice was tho deciding one in determin ing this matter, decided against Can ada, as naturally he had to do if ho would give tho JangTiage of tho treaty effect. This was very much to the dis content of Canada, but she had to sub mit. And now Canada sets forth her "right" to equal treatment with the I'nitod Slates in tho Panama Caual, which the United States has built. It seems curious indeed that Canada should consider that sho has any rights iu that canal, since ihc did not put up one cent for constructing it, and &ince the treaties which Canada refers to in her argument were expressly abrogated by the second treaty between Secretary Hay and Lord Pauuecfote. Indeed, the L". S Senate made it a condition thai the United States should have a frue hand in building and regulating tho ca nal before it, would agree to the treaty or to proceed with the canal enter prise. That, treaty, of cotirso, provided that nil nations ifhoiildbe on an equal ity in tho use of that canal, but as President Taft fairly points out, it is lmporfsiblo to consider that the United States would or did .stipulate against itself in its agreement lo treat all na tions with impartiality in the use of that, canal. The equality clause merely applies In nations other than our own, that wish to avail themselves of tho use of that caual. As a matter of fact, the United states is under uo obliga tion to build a canal; it can leave it unfinished if it ehooes; it van finish it to allow of the passage of my cer- I lain clnssos of vessels, and those ves i sols of our own use or build, The United Slates simply agrees that it will not discriminate as between other nations in tho use of I hut canal, and to hold othorwiso would .make ua the chump among nations. To be sure, Canada in this ense, just as in "its insistence that sinuousil.y meant a straight lino, will set forth absurd claims, lint it is no part of the duty of this government to pay any attontion to those claims; and wo do not imagine that the heat of Canadian Statesmen in regard. to this matter will have I he slightest effect' upon our gov eminent. ' THE 

MOTIVE OF THE LAW. In the discussion of the "rider" on the postoffice appropriation bill which was evidently partly designed for re venge upon the newspapers and partly as a censorship over them, the news papers of tho country have generally joined, and always with a keen, criti cal view of that legislation, which is by no means complimentary to tho persons who stood for ii. In all that discussion, wc have not seen anything more per tinent and direct as following the origin of that legislation to its propor source than the following editorial in a recent number of tho Portland Ore gonian: GETTING EVEN WITH THE PUESS. The Boston Transcript Is credited. In a paragraph grolnc; the rounds of tho newspapers, with the statement that Senator Bourne used his position as chairman of the Senate Committee on Postofflces lo get even with the newspapers by procuring the enact ment of the drastic newspaper Inquisi torial law. Senator Bourne's supposed motive for taklmr revenue on tho news papers Is that tlie press of Oregon gen erally opposed his re-election. It Is a fuct that Mr. Bourne Is chair man of the postoffice committee and was a member of the conference com mittee, that In the recent Congress ad justed a dispute with the House over tho postoffice appropriation bill, to which the obnoxious and Impossible publicity provision was attached us a rider. H Is a fact that tho press of Oregon was al most a unit In opposition lo Senator Bourno's re-election, nnd It Is a fact that the publicity amendment was slipped through without discussion and without the knowledgo of press or people. It Is a fact, too, that It contains provisions relative lo tho labeling of "advertise ments" that arc similar lo certain pro visions of Oregon's rcmarkablo corrupt practices act. But whether it is a fact lliat Senator Bourne was inspired by any vengeful motive of reprisal upon the newspapers the Oregonlan docs not know, and does not much care, if It shall seem to Senator Bourne worth while to dis claim any such purpose, wc shall accept his statement .at face value. The provisions of the new publicity law requiring the newspapers to pub lish at stated Intervals tho names of their owners and editors, and also their creditors If they have any. as well ns i Ihelr circulation, nre not objectionable In themselves, nnd most newspapers comply cheorfully. Tho public is undoubtedly entitled to know what Influences con trol, directly or indirectly, their news papers; and It Is to be observed thnt. while the new law has been taken into court to determine its constitutionality, nearly all have nevertheless fulfilled Uigbc con ditions; The offensive implication of the law is that tlie newspapers of the United States have been selling their news or editorial pages, or both an assumption that is groundless and liltle less than outrageous. The starching and particu lar 'demand Is made that the newspaper shall forfeit the right to tho malls unless It shall label as "advertisements" all no tices for which money is paid or any "valuable consideration " glvim an intol erable assumption of censorship over the columns of the press that is generally rn sentcd and Is being nowhere obeyed. iN'o honest newspaper . will deceive Its pa trons as to the character or inspiration for any Item or article or advertisement: lio other newspaper can hope to succeed in tho long run if It prints tainted news or opinions. But no newspaper whatever can maintain it-s Independence or self respect If It shall permit to be trans ferred to Government censorship control of Its columns and dictation as to the character of their contents. If a news paper must hear every day on its pages the stamp or Hie Government's approval, or suffer the stigma of Its disapproval, all constitutional guarantees as to free speech mean nothing and we shall have In this country a Russianized press that dares speak tho truth only when some upstart bureaucrat in Washington gives his consent or has his back turned. The wide sweep of tho Inquisitorial statute may be understood when it is said that under its terms- strictly in terpreted, a book may not be sunt to a newspaper for review, unless the opin ion of the editor, whether favorable or unfavorable, shall be labeled "adver tisement." Nor may a notice be given of a public performance of any kind, lo which admission Is oharged, and to which a newspaper representative mny have been Invited for purposes of criticism or report, unless It shall be designated "ad vertisement." A snorting editor Is given a pass to a footbnll game. The price of admission Is trifling, and the so-called courtesy on that account Is nominal or negligible; but the freedom of the field Is all-Important, nnd is not to be had for a price, but only as a matter of ac commodation. Yet Ihc Government would apparently require all newspapers to fasten upon a running account of a great sporting event the untrue mark of "ad vertisement." All this sounds ridiculous, of eourse: but the Postoffice Department, asked to interpret the law, has given out word that U will follow the strict lotter of its provisions. Yet the Solicitor General of the United Stales In his brief, filed be fore the Supreme Couvt the other day. plainly intimated that lie had no expec tation of thf "advertisement" feature of the law being pronounced valid. He seemed to rest his contention upon the desirability, from the standpoint of public policy, of knowing the names of news paper owners nnd creditors. He makes an appeal for the. court to sustain at least ho much of the proposed inquisition. Mr. Beck, an attornev for ope of the pub lishers, attacks the consiitnlioniill' v of the law as a whol. with powerful and convincing argument; and t seems to be clear that tho proposed Inquiry bv the Government into the affairs of news papers nlnnds upon donblful ground. To which it mav be proper to add that the people of Oregon gave Senator Houriic his walking papers at tho recent election iu excellent form and for pro per cause. ANOTHER DISCLAIMER. Once more wc havo an afi.-urancc that Colonel Ifoose.velt will not repeat ai(d be a candidate again for tho Presi dency' of the United States. This comes from .Mr. Charles; Sumner Bird, de feated Progressive cifudidatc for Gov cruor of Massachusetts, in an address made in Boston at the Progressive ban quet held on "Wednesday evening. No assurance like this, however, can be as direct and as positive as the pub lic disclaimer made eight years ago and repealed five years ago, by f'olonej Uoosevelt himself. lie stated, in fact, that his candidacy would be a calam ity to tho country, and such indeed it. has proved; and yet ho slated tho cal amitous result of that candidacy ns a reason why he should not enter the race. Bui he did enter the race, and tho calamity which he foresaw came upon tho Republican party with crush ing force. It i& pitiful to havo to say it, but the fact is thnt any assurance from Colonel Koosevolt or from anybody for him, can not bo expected to bind his notion; for ho has himself given tho most absolute proof that any Mich promieo will not bind him as against his own subsequent inclinations. In excuse for his candi dacy the present year, ho urged that what .he mount when eight years ago ho disclaimod a further candidacy, was a consccutlvo candidacy; but this was evidently nn afterthought and was not iu hiH first statemont at all. And since it will bo easy to persuade him that the Progressive party will be snuffed out if he docs not stand as its candidate four years hence, the probability is that he will again be n candidate at that time. "Indeed, a dispatch practi cally announces this with the evidont suggestion that ho wants to capture the Bcpublicnn pnrty for tho purpose of his candidacy, in spite of his do nnnciations of that party as corrupt and effete. The coming Progressive National Conference in Chicago, however, may possibly develop something on this line that will bo absolute, and that the pco plo can either put faith in or find reason to fully stigmatize Boosovolt as one in whom no faith can bo put. 

MISS BOARDMAN DECORATED. Iu tho circular which Colonel James A. Irons, of tho Twentieth Infantry, is sending to citizens hero in support of the movement for relief for tho Balkan sufferers, he quotes tho appeal mado by Miss Mabel T. Boardman, member of tho American Be.d Cross at Washington, D. C. Her appeal is in bohalf of the International Bed Cross committee at Geneva and each of tho Bed Cro-s societies of Turkey, Bulgaria, Servia, Greece, and Montenegro, which have asked aid from tho United States. Tier appeal is a strong and effectivo one. In this connection it is a matter of interest to learn that tho new Mikado of Japan has conferred a decoration on Miss Boardman for her valuable ser vices to Japau through tho Bed Cross. Tho iufluonco of this country in. amel iorating tho horrors of war is recog nized hy the Mikado iu his decoration of Miss Boardman, and thero is no doubt but that much has been accom plished both on land and sea in reliev ing combatants from hard conditions and protecting noncombatants, through tho iufluonco of the United States. It is recognized everywhere that "no other country has douo so much to use the Bod Cross organization for this mitigation of suffering ia remote coun tries as has tho United States," and tho official recognition by tho Mikado of tho philanthropic efforts of Ameri can citizens is most wolcome. Mis? Boardman, as tho leader in the United Slates of this move for- relicT for tho Balkan suffering, will naturally take great satisfaction in the decoration from the Mikado, with his recognition of tho leading influence of the United States in this-humane direction. Tho relief which Colonel Irons has in char go for tho bonefit of Balkau suf ferers is lo take the form of a concert in tho Tabernacle uext Tuesday even ing, at which ho .will have tho Twen tieth Infantry baud, with leading musi cians of this city who aro generously co-operating in this movement, which is expected to yield good, results; aud tho way that the peoplo of this city havo taken hold of it, leaves little doubt but that it will bo ono of tho most', successful musical events ever given in Salt Lake. DEMOCRATS AND CTIVIL SERVICE. There is a good deal of grumbliDg in the Democratic ranks, or as the Mugwumps would say, among th "spoilsmen," at the dreary prospect ol thero not being offices onough at3Prosi dent Wilson's disposal to go around. The withdrawal into the civil eervicu class bv President Taft of some 35,000 fourth-class postmasters' positions from the appointive class, appears tc create an aching void among fnithful Democrats, and tho Springfield (Mass.) Republican, in view of the grumbling, asks why the Democrats do not make a thorough job of it by repealing the civil service law while they are about it. It will be remembered that that precisely what the House of Represen tatives started to do at the rogular ses sion which began a year ago. The House passed a bill providing that the tenure of office undor the civil service should last ouly a few years, and thou tho incumbent should bo obliged to pass another examination, and so on successively until finally the Republi can occupant of the position could be got rid of. It is certain that the Democrats will not suffer themselves to bo thwarted in thoir desire to huvc control of tho public ollie.C3 by any obstacle that they themselves can remove; aud if thoy are able to so amend tho civil service law as to throw open tho competition at least, for all tho poiulious to Demo crats under the manipulation of a Dem ocratic civil servico board, it need cau.se no surprise to sco tho Democrats take that courso, or ovon repeal tho civil sorvico law altogether; for they are extremely desirous to have tho of fices, and naturally, ainco few Demo crats arc in office. The party mon would consider It a great anomaly to havo control of tho offices and not occupy them. Evidently some surprises arc in ttorc for thoso simplo enough to think that the Democrats will bo cou lent to remain out of office while their party is in power. A Chicago woman says the can't live on $10,000 a year. Well, for a woman that can't live oh ..10,000 a year, the grasc ought to yawn. .MaMjftMtfs if Now ii'OuTlw Homej lState A Now we have plenty of room to show p toys.
