Real Estate Sale. II. Gumberta sold at auction, on Saturday, about thirty-three acres of land, located just above the city, for $75 per acre. Plenty. If there is any one thing that is in extraordinary supply in our city, it ia the mud. We have oceans of it. The " oceans " arc scarcely navigable, however. fita" Dr. O'Leary, the physiological lecturer, has written to secure Masonic Hall for a scries of lectures, to be given in a week or two. 3f Tha doctors say that some of the green wall-paper3 contain enough arsenic to kill a person. We shouldn't wonder, provided any one should eat enough of tbo nourishing food. , I, . This is a poor market for skates. We ought to have a rink, and roller skating. The National Hall would do first-rate, if large enough, and we believe it is. lSFSome chap, with an eye to a good meal, " yanked " a very nice venison-ham off the rack, in front of the New York Grocery, one day Itst County Board. The Board of County Commissioners will meet in regular session this morning. Among the first business to be transacted is the drawing of a new Grand Jury. Left. Quito a large party of citi zens from New Darmony, who had been sojourning in our city for several days, left for their homes on the steamer West Wind on Saturday evening. ' Returned. Wo are pleased to note that J. G. Kennedy, Cashier of the Evansville National Bank, and Philip C. Decker, of the firm of Ben nett & Decker, have returned from New Orleans, after an absence of sev eral weeks. Fatal. It seems that Edward Ruder, aged six years, who was scald ed by accidentally falling into a kettle of hot water in Union Township, early last week, which we noted at the time, died oa account of the injuries received. Congress. This important body win convene to-day, ana we may jooe for the President's Message shortly. We understand that it is not very lengthy. It 13 hardly probable that CoDgresa will transact much business of importance untilfter the holidays. Educational. Prof. A. M. Gow, our excellent Superintendent of Pub lic Schools, will deliver an address before the Stat3 Superintendents' Association, at Indianapolis, on De cember 27th, entitled " Ethical cul ture in our Common Schools." He will, no doubt, do the subject justice Fell In. We learn that the roof over tho ice house at Kroner's old brewery, in Jjamasco, cavea in on Saturday night, crushing the walls somewhat, and otherwise injuring the building. We did not learn the cause of the disaster, or the probable amount of loss by the same. Sample Licessz. We notice in an exchange that Covington. Ky.. has decided to charge all persons who eel goods by samples a license feo of twenty , dollars. It will be rcmem bered that an effort was made to im pose a license similar to the above in our city, but the Council voted it down almost unanimously. Post Office Change. Sounders ville, the name by which the Post Office at Ingle's Station, oa the E. & C. Railroad, Vanderburgh County, has beea cabled, has been cbauged to Ioglefield, and Charles Morris is ap pointed postmaster, in place tf John Ingle, Sr., resigned. Mr. It gle was, probably, the oldest postmaster in the United States, hav- ine been aDDointed by President Monroe, forty-five years ego, and has held the office continuously up to the 1st day of December, 18G9, haviDg occupied his official position through the administrations of eleven differ ent Presidents. It is the best testi monial that can be presented of hi3 fidelity to his trust and the confidence and esteem of his neighbors. When be entered on duty, his office did a larger business than that at Evans ville, and Shawneetown was the Dis tributing Office for all this rcg:on of country in the three States of Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. Mr. Ingle is now in his eighty-second year. How great are tho changes he has wit nessed in the society and progress of v anderburgh County ! Too Poor to Lote. A young man in this city, whose exchequer was not in as plethonie a state as he could wish, and who had been "waiting'' upon a young lady for some time, finally made up his mind to "pro pose," but didnot have tho nerve to make a declaration in propria persona, so he sent a highly perfumed note conveying to the lady the information that he would bo "forever and truly happy" if she would only say "yes" to the momentous question he bad propounded. He waited patiently for tho answer, which was also written on "doubla extra" perfumed paper, pur chased at the Journal office, and was as follows: I'd give to thee this hand of mine If thon but had'st the dimes ; Bat parses short and slim as thine "Won it do for these hard times. , I leave thee In thy wretchedness, AS one too poor to mate; For love, you know, can only bless When based on real estate. Carmi Survey. From Robert A. Hill, Esq., who returned from Carmi very early yesterday morning, we learn that Mr. Ilartwell's party reached Carmi on Saturday night. The distance from the Wabash River to Carmi, by the survey, is about eleven miles. On to-morrow the sur veyors will start on the return, and will survey from the Little Chain, on tho Wabash, to Mt. Vernon, and thence to this city. It will take them 1 a a, -1 a 1 1 rr uuout two weeits to get tnrougu. lao people at Carmi seem to thiik that the subscription of $100,000 will probably carry at the coming election. The indications appear to be favor able. Got Loose. A young man bau- tered Master Hcary Wheeler, one of tbo "Von Bomelswitzens," on Sat urday, to let him tie him with a rope, and agreed, if he got loose, that he would make him a present of ten dol lars. Having accepted the offer, he was tied up in such a manner that it was not thought possible for him to get loose. But he went to work with a will, and af ter one hour's hard la bor, stepped out of the ropes free. He refused to take the money, but it is understood that tho loser will settle the ecore " for a supper for a small party. These young Davenport imitators are certainly " no slouches" in getting out of the ropes. Union Prater Meetings. The daily Union Prayer Meetings will be held this week in the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, corner of Wal nut and Second Streets. As this loca tion is the most central to the busi ness men, the hope has been expressed that they will endeavor to be present as often as possible. The meeting is opened at 8 o'clock, and continues for three quarters of an hour. This morning it will be lei by Rev. Mr. Kumler, and the subject of prayer and remark " Young Men." Circuit Court. In the case of Wm. . P. Mills vs. John B. Mills, the jury gave a verdict in lavor ot the plaintiff, awarding judgment in the sum of $2,550. It will be remembered that the plaintiff brought suit against the defendant for his interest and in surance in the Picayune Mill, de stroyed by fire in 18G5. A motion was made for a new trial, but has not yet been decided. Judge Baker, of Vinccnnes, pre sided over tho Court on Saturday af ternoon ; but little business was trans acted. Til 3 Census. The Congress that meets to-day will soon pass a bill or- . ganizing a census liureau lor the census of 1870. When this is taken, j we will know exactly the population of this city, and will bo able to make accurate comparison with New Al bany, and other places that claim to be as big as Evansville. It is proba ble that the census committee will recommend to Congress a provision for the enumeration of the different religious sects, which has never been done heretofore. Not Changed. The question of changing the hour of the meeting of the Trinity M. E. Sunday-school, from 9 A. sr., to 2 P. jr., which has been talked about for some time, wa3 finally settled yesterday. A vote of the teachers was taken, and it was de cided by a large majority not to make a change; therefore tho school will meet at 9 A. M. as heretofore. Muss. We learn that a high old fight took place, yesterday, at the sa loon of John Schoeftcr, near the creek, in Lowei Lamasco, in which an old German, named John Bitter, was badly beaten. Who the other parties were that had a hand in the fisrht we did net learn, but we under stand that " things were lively" around there for a while. Preaching. There will be preach ing services in the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church every night dur ing the present week, commencing to-night at 7 o':lock. .Tbo Pastor will be assisted "'by Rev. W. M. Chce ver, of Terre Haute, one of the most popular and effective preachers of the West. He will doubtless be welcom ed by good congregations. "Knucked." Two men, whose namt s we did not learn, had a quarrel yetrday afternoon, and one was struck over -the eye with a pair of brass knuckles. There was no ar rest, a3 the injured man belorged on a fHtboat, and he thought it would not pay to remain to prosecute. Council. The City Couacil meets this evening. We suppose the qu s tion of makinz an appropriation to pay the expenses of the delegation to Washington City will be eettled in some manner. We are informed that it is probable the delegation will be reduced, as it is thought that it is hardly necessary to send a committee of five. More Spinners. Tho proprietors of the Evansville Cotton, Mills find ing it necessary to add more machin ery, two new sets of spinners have been purchased, which arrived on Friday, and were hauled to the mill yesterday. This mill has already ac quired an excellent reputation, and a very fine article of domestic is turned out in largo supply every week. We learn that further improvements will be made before a great while. Closed. Nearly every saloon in the city was closed yesterday. We understand there were one or two exceptions in Lamasco. A number of saloon keepers say they would be willing to close every Sunday, law or no law, if the others would do the same. Since it is impossible for the " old nippers " to get any beer on Sunday, the demand for " ale by the bor," sent to tlie houses, ha3 largely increased. One saloon was kept open, but noth ing was sold except cider and hot cof fee. There was an occasional de- mand for "lager," but tho proprietor would only shake his head, and point to a huge card on tho wall labeled ' Q,im J... T . m tt . nJ nnncl-iiil pTt;, black crapa. No further explanation wa3 necessary. Societt Anniversary. Yester day afternoon was observed by the (Jermau Catholics as the anniversary of St. Francis Xavier, but was mere especially celebrated as th9 anniver sary of the organization of the Society of the "Sanct Franciscus Xaverus Orphan Asylum." The Society num bers about four hundred members in this city, each of whom gives twenty five cents per month towards support ing the Orphan Asylum at Vincennes, to which all orphans in this Diocese are sent to be taken caro of. There are about two hundred and fifty orphans at the Asylum at present, twelve of whom six boys and six girls came down to this city on Saf urday, and marched with the proces sion fiom tho Trinity Catholic Church to 8t. Mary's. The Crescent City Silver Band marched at the head of the procession, and attracted a large crowd by their fine music. The fit. Mary's Church was densely packed, and the exercises were very interest ing. Theodore Richsten has been the President 0: this Society, in this city, the past year, but his successor was to have been chosen yesterday evening. Personal. Gen. James C. Vcatch passed through the city . Saturday night en route to Rockport, and is in excellent health. Gen. Alvin P. Hovey, United States Minister to Peru, is in tho city stop ping at the Sherwood House. He leaves to-day for Indianapolis, where he will stop for a few days, and then leave for Peru via Washington City. Hon. Robt. T. Glass, Representa tive from Henderson County, Ken tucky, was in the city on Saturday en route to Frunkfort. Tom Collins, editor of the Mount Vernon Democrat, was in the city on Saturday. Caleb Tolman, of Livermore, with J his dog Vengeance, or the Black Re venger, wss in the city, at the Amer- I ican House, on Saturday. He left by ! the Morning Star Saturday night. A. H. Cardin, of Marion, Ky., was in the city on Saturday to renew his subscription to the Evansville
