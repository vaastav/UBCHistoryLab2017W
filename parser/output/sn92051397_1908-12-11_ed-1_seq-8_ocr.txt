In the various discussions, which are provoked from time to time over the rates of taxation Imposed by govern ment, It appears to be Impossible to interest 111" ronibatiints In the equally important issno of government ex penses. The close connection between the (wo Is overlooked, and with an ob stinacy that suei"M an Interest only In an escnpr from some sbar of the burden Imposed by the tax. This is all the more stransie because the question of just and equitable taxation In na Hon, ftnte and town will never bf set tled until It Is studied froni the point of view of Royernmeut expenses. In his annua report to'ihe onnuress, Secretary of the Treasury Oortelynn makes the Interesting and Important suggestion, thnt tf A whole session of that body was Riven over to thn con sideration of the ways and means to reduce expenses. It would b possible to roiidtn't thn affairs of the federal Government at n saving of several mil lions a. year and without In any way Impairing the eftlelency of government. The 'Washington correspondent of the fprlngfleld Republican, commenting upon the suggestion, says: "In a very rnlld and diplomatic way he has stated what every intelligent person, who knows anything whatever about, th" methods of the congress, knows to op true. The present manner of making tip the national budget Is haphazard, exrept where It Is worse. In the fact of a big deficit for the yeHr and wllh an apparent lack of any other practical problem seriously considered for the winter's work, It Is beyond question that congress should devote Itself primarily to the reorganization and co ordination of the national finances, Adopting for Itself rational and modern business methods Just as these have, already been largely Introduced In th executive departments under President lioosevrlt." These statements carry conviction with them. The congress of the United f tales, like every other American legis lative body, Is a human Institution. Being human II bad fallen Into ft rut sfi far as expenses are concerned. There has been no pressing necessity, as there would be in a commercial un ilertnkln.g. to watch the pennies, and In consequence expenses have been con stantly Inereasing without regard to needed economies. It has been every body's business to spend, of to suggest methods In which money could be spent, hut It. has been nobody's busi ness to economize except In refusing new expenditures. A general Inquiry Into the business methods of the gov ernment, especially In the. legislative department, for the purpose of ascer taining whether the public business could he carried on more cheaply, and more effectively has not hrn under taken within the memory of man. In other words, no one knows or has ever undertaken to learn whether the na tion's money Is being spent with the recklessness of n drunken Bailor or not. If It Is a good Idea, as Secretary Cor tlyou suggests, to reorganize and co ordinate the national finances, It la relatively Important thing for Connec ticut and New Haven to undertake the Rama Inquiry. Connecticut apont In the last year far more than her revenues supplied. New Ha.vnn Is restive under what. Is believed to he nn excessive tax rate hut neither political Institution has the remotest. Idea whether the cost of government. Is greater than It should be, or whether the business methods employed are modern and sultef to the conditions. True, eight, years ago a competent commission made, a report, with regard to the receipts and ex- penses of the stats government and In that report It wa stated that thou Bands and thousands could be annually saved without In the .least Impairing the efficiency of government. No at tention was ever paid th report, which at, the time was taken to mean that any interruption of prevailing methods would Interfere with tlie political game as It was then played and Is still played Connecticut cannot be called prudent slate when It finds outlay ex I'neiliiiL In. nme and does nothing to rectify the siiuation.

ROOHFAKI.T. As time goes on the obvious compari son, naturally suggested, between the man Roosevelt and his methods and the man Taft and his methods becomes not only Interesting but. Instructive and vital. It is evident that they were not cast from moulds at all alike. Their methods of thinking on nearly every subject are quite dissimilar and on not a few fundamentals they are diametri cally the reverse of each other. The Washington correspondent of the Springfield Republican has long sines shown himself (o be H man of ex ceptional lusl;jht. tine of the most Interesting "stories," as newspaper men are wont to call them, which Mr, Honker has .sent bis paper In some time Is a comparison of Taft and Roosevelt, In whl.'h he conies much nearer arriving at the real truth than do most men. It Is freely pronhesi,"d that Mr. Taft will never prove himself such nn apt pupil at the merry game of politics n.t Mr. Roosevelt, who "lias a positive genius for politics." Where Mr. Roosevelt has beep Inclined to "Jolly," If for no other purpose Ih.m fo keep hnrnvui) in the rmks of his party, Mr. Taft har already on several occasions shown a readiness to speak right out In tnentln' and to give vent t" his en tire conviction. No one Incident to date, perhaps, has Illustrated this fundamental difference between Hoikseveltioni and Taftlnn than th attitude of th two men to ward Mr. Cannon and the speakership. Says thn story referred to: "Whether or not there is to be a peace pact, it is now history that since the election Mr. Taft has made no concealment of the feeling that hetween him and the speaker there Is a direct antagonism. This contrasts sharply with President Roosevelt's treatment of Mr. Cannon. Although speaker and president have been a far apart ns the poles on cer tain Issues, Mr. Roosevelt has never enred, or never dared to make general war upon the vigorous old man from Danville. Representatives have been called to the White House and urged to vote thus and so on Individual is sues, hut at lenst the outward form of hnrmonlous relations between Mr. Can non and Mr. Roosevelt has always been maintained. Kaeh has always been ready to "Jolly" the other along, al though at the very time pnsslhly en gaged In nn active effort to defeat the other's alms In some given matter of legislation." Mr. Hooker Is not quite prepared to say that Mr. Taft may not Koniewhat change his tactics after he has had some more familiarity with the work ings of the presidential office, and af ter he h'is been administered the copi ous potions of "advice" he Is sure to get, from those politically near to him. He la certain, however, that Mr. Tail will never be another Roosevelt and that assertion has Its elements of great Htlraotlveness. He sees In him a sort of second Orover Cleveland, "the type of mnn who, though genial and Mossed with a sense of humor, must hammer things out on more direct and simple lines (than Mr. Roosevelt). " The qualities of such another as ,is the much beloved drover will be much appreciated In the White House, one thing Is certain. It Is that If Mr, Tafl Is another Cleveland, and l here, is iriueh reason to believe he Is, he is not the sort of man to be ea.ily changed, either by the exigencies of office or by the ear-counsels of those who have personal axes to grind.

IIRIU I I,OMS fftfiftKSTIUS. 7n the great and creditable, world flght which Is at present being waged on tuberculosis, nothing can bring about better results than universal understanding among the masses of the people of the conditions which tend to encourage thnt dread mnlady nnd of the effective means which have been discovered by science to cheat It of Its victims. That being the case, few undertakings can lie conceived to better bring about this result than the present tuberculosis exhibition at. the Museum of Natural History In New York. II might be supposed thai such an exhibit, would prove of Interest only to the medical men and a few other curious ones, but. that has not 1 u the ease, Mlcer since the first day when that exhibit, opened Its doors New Yorlicis have Ihroligeil lo it to an extent far beyond any one's ex pectations or hopes. An attendance of live thousand a day I in . I been predicted as something extraordinary; but fifty Ibousnnd dny would come much nearer the reality, In one af ternoon, between the house of 2 and a o'clock, as many as ti t ) -t liree Little Civic Sermons, No. 27, The Music of 1 HE music of the hammer in construction did it ever seem like music something beyond the din of the clamor ? It says again and again that somebody has work; the dinner pail is not empty. But, best of all and most of all, somebody is to have a home. When the hammers are busy the wheels of commerce are turning to their strokes. The bunting was swaying in the breeze the other day; the flags were flying and the bands and singing societies were marshaling in tune. Way up in a housetop, with their heads among the sheltering boughs of the trees, the hammers were pounding away without cessation, They had a livelier ring than the strains of the band, and they sang a merrier lay. Somebody was to have a home. Columbus Press-Post. thousand persons visited the exhibit rooms. The practical results which are sure to come, will be consider- able, Not frequently Is such co-operation to be observed 111 any exhibit of this kind. Not less than two hundred as sociations and Individuals have ex hibits, notably among the latter be ing Nathan Straus, whoso system of providing pure milk for the poor has i proved Itself on of the best philan thropies of New York oily. Every sort of effectual means to instruct I hope who attend is used. Three en tire doors are occupied nud almost, all the larger cities In the Cnlon are co operating, besides fifteen foreign countries. There is a model dairy with real cows and there nre health-! ful and unhenlthfiil slokrnoms with wax figures. All make the b. st sort of object-lesson and the sermon (hoy (each Is aided by I be lectures (if ex pert demonstrators. It Is n surprising f,n ( to those who, do not realize It that every minute and a half a human life Is snuffed nut In this country from tuberculosis alone, enough so that If I he bodies of those who die within one year were placed three feet apart along the rail road track, they would extend from New York to Hartford: This fact Is strikingly Illustrated on a chart to every visitor as he enters and n row of electric lights is switched off ami o.i again as caeh death occurs to Impress the fact. No one knows how long this exhibit will remain in New York. It should reni.iln there s long ns It Is ac complishing thi' results It Is ncconi plh blng now. Hut sooner or later It Is pro4oP,ed to lake the exhibit to other cities i it her in Its entirety or In sections. It would certainly prove worth the investment could It be dup licated many times and shown every where from ocean to ocean. New Ha ven should at once lake the necessary Steps to get the exhibit for a while as soon ns possible. Wo offer th pertinent suggestion to those who have already aroused such n hearty interest In the tight on tuberculosis locally that they begin the necessary negotiations. There will be many other communities to want It, but those which show the greatest Inter est will piobahl get It tlrst, after New Yoik has bnrned its valuable lessons. M I V Utll MM U.

IV. Ward writes of the many Journalistic conlllcls and conquests that liie print, with which h" has associated himself for half a century, has lakeii part. It, is fi'i'ii tliat The Independent has been represented in the fore on every occasion. Connected with Tile Independent in one way or another have been many well known men.

Professor Woolsey of Yale, one of the niost notable authorities, if nt the most notable authority, In America to- day on the absorbing subject of Inter national law, has stated thnt there Is absolutely nothing In the talk of war between this country and .lapan.
