The sun rose- up In the morning Through his door in the Eastern sky;, And he flung back his curtains of purple and red To look out on the world, and he laughed as he said, "There's nothing so bright as IV Hut he never had seen my baby's smile, That is brighter than sun- shine ull the while. The moon stole out In the evening From the cloud; and up, up she rolled Through the wonderful blue of the Autumn night, And phe said, "Ah, the sun may be never so bright, Still there's nothing to match my gold!" Well, the moon, she's gold- en and soft and fair, F.ut she couldn't have seen my baby's hair. The stars peeped after tlje twilight: And when they were sure It was gone, They all flocked forth in a glit- terlng show, Singing. "No one can dance like this below, Though we've nothing to dance upon!" So they twinkled In mazes light and fleet, Eut they never had watched my baby's feet Barrington McGregor. As a matter of truth we acted the rolo of a masked highwayman tow ards Colombia. Instead of buying the territory which we could have done snd kept our conscience clear we "Imply held our neighbor up with a gun while another fellow acting In our behalf "frisked" his pockets. With that record standing against us we have no cause to wail much about the German Invasion of Belgium and Luxemburg. We reported to the same species, of ruthless aggression our selves not many years ago. The only difference is wo picked upn a coun try that did not have any big brothers to fight for him.

It is doubtful if one college student In a thousand knew of the existence of this school until a year ago.

But it is not true this nation has always refrained from aggression and conquest. When Roosevelt was pres ident this country' manifested towards Colombia all the traits of a German kaiser. We could have purchased the canal zone from Colombia for fifteen million dollars. But we were un willing to pay that sum though we were willing to pay fifty million, and did pay that amount, to the defunct and corrupt French company that had previously worked on the canal. So this country became the chief factor in a plot to rob Colombia of Its vauable piece of property. It has been exposed and proven time and again that the Panama revolution in I Itself amounted to nothing. It was a mere fake and would not have suc ceeded and would not have occurred had this coutry not beeii in on the Job. Colombia had 4,000 aoldlera available for quelling the so-called rebellion. But under orders from Washington our marines took charge of the Panama railroad and refused to allow the road used in carrying troops of the nation owning the ter ritory. The revolution was at the Pacific end of the (one and the Co lombian aoldlera were on the Atlantic side. Because of our course they were placed in a predicament where they could not reach the scene of trouble without going through Im passable swamps and Jungle. While Colombia was thus hampered we hastily recognized the ao-called republic of Panama and agreed to a ready-made treaty under which we took over the canal zone for a cer tain sum, nil those who were in on the trearhery being rewarded of Course with fat profits. It was noth ing more nor less than a straight hold up. At the time the canal sone was gotten this country thought little of the matter. We wanted the terri tory and got It. so were satisfied. Colombia was a little country and could do nothing more than "holler." Co nothing (Mine of the affair, though our reputation with South American nations was badly damaged. One of the speakers at the annual meeting of the Academy of Political Science yesterday ad Govcmnunt Is vanced the theory Nol Business, thnt "a constitutional government is a cor poration organized to carry on public business" and that "the managers of a public corporation have much the same kind of business problems as the managers of private corporations." There could be no greater error. Government is not business, and business is not government. If busi ness were managed the way govern ment has to be managea, It would be in the hands of a receiver. If gov ernment were managed the way bus iness is managed, there would be a revoution. There are certain technical busi ness problems In government; but, curiously enough, the men who are most successful In solving them are not business men. The business man is usually a failure in government because he treats government as a business. And for a similar reason, the successful statesman Is rarely a competent business man. The great secretaries of the treasury, for ev ample Hamilton, Gallatin, Chase and McCulloch were notably deficient in so-called business ability, and with very few exceptions millionaire busi ness men who reach the United States senate found themselves fully out of their element. Lincoln could savehe Union, but the Illinois Central rail road regarded his legal services as practically worthless. The business of business is to show a profit; but the business of govern ment is to promote the general wel fare, and the general welfare cannot be reduced to dollars and cents or to any tangible matter of bookkeeping.
