Cankers, debarred from ex chanins certificates of small denomination for certificates of large denomination, would resort to the trick of presenting preat stacks of the Fmaller bills for gold und then turning In the gold In exchange for gold certificates of large denomination. This would be an endless chain in a way, and would caue unnecessary trouble to the treasury- Holders of silver certificates would get bv indirection what they are prevented ft en getting directly, and then when the time might arrive to make it desirable to reconvert the gold certificates Into small bills, the process would be tedious.

Express Companies Said to De Doing a Large Exchange Banlness. WASHINGTON", Dec. 9. Col. J. C. Boyd, assistant attorney general, gave a hearing to-day to John A. Carver and others, rep resenting a committee of the American Bankers" Association, and John J. McCook, representing the Wells-Fargo Express Com pany, and Charles Steele, of the Adams Ex press Company, on the question of tho tax ability of express companies as brokers un der the war revenue act. The Question has been before the commissioner of internal revenue for some months, tho bankers claiming' that the express companies not enly do a Urge business In domestic ex change, but also In foreign exchange, and Vinder the wording of the war revenue act are clearly liable to a tax as brokers. Mr. Carver contended that the express companies, or some of them, at least, did a larga foreign exchange business, and that owing to the fact that they had hitherto heen exempt from the tax, they had been able to cut rates to such an extent as to drive banks out of tho exchange business, lie Insisted that checks, orders, drafts, and all Instruments of that character were In effect bills of exchange, and therefore clearly within the scope of the law. Some time ago Commissioner Wilson de cided that express companies engaged in buying and selling foreign coin were sub ject to the tax. The question of their lia bility, however, for Issuing travelers checks, cable transfers of money or do mestic exchange was not decided, and the whole matter was referred to the attorney general for an opinion on the questions In volved. Mr. McCook and Mr. Steele asked per mission to file briefs, which was granted. Mr. McCook maintained 'briefly, however, that if express companies were declared liable to the tax, telegraph companies must tlso be Included. Thus, about 101.000 of flees of these companies, representing largely the business activity and industry of the whole country would be practically closed to the public. The business men of the country, he said, would not consent to any such restrictions on their methods of doing business. Large areas of the coun try .depended almost entirely on tho ex press and telegTaph companies for the transmission of funds. Colonel Boyd stated that he would receive briefs any time be tween now and Jan. 1. RECIPROCITY TREATIES. Scope of the Agreements rltlx Great nrltnln and France. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The reciprocity treaties negotiated between the United States and France and between the United States and Great Britain during the past Bummer, the terms of which have been carefully guarded, have at last been printed. They were transmitted to the Senate on Tuesday and via be taken up for conspiration by tho Senate Committee on Foreign Relations at the first meeting of that committee, which probably wlh be held next Wednesday. The treaty with Great- Britain covers the dependencies of Jamaica, Bermuda, Barbadoes, British Gui ana and Turks and Calcos Islands. All the agreements Include lists of arti cles on which concessions are made by the respective parties. Those with Great Brit ain are signed on the part of the United States by John Kasson and on the part of Great Britain by Mr. Reginald Towers. The French treaty is signed by Mr. Kasson and Ambassador Cambon. The list of re ductions In each case is followed by treaty articles giving the general terms of the stipulation. The French convention Is made applicable to Algeria and Its products as It is to France and its products. The general terms of all the treaties are practically the same, the stipulation being in most cases, that "In case either of the contracting parties shall, during the con tinuance of this convention increase the duties upon the importation of merchan dise, the increase shall be without discrim ination or prejudice against the products of the other." There are variations of this provision. 'For Instance, in the case of Jamaica, it is stipulated that the lncrea?e shall In no case exceed 50 per cent, of the present duty. In the case of France It Is provided that "Any reduction 'of the duty of the tariff act of 1SD7 upon sparkling wines or upon certain articles of woolen manufacture. Im ported Into tho United States from any other European country shall be imme diately extended to the articles when Im ported from France."

The various publications coming from European sources touching the decision of the powers to meet the United States re quest for a formal written undertaking to maintain the "open door" in China are giv ing satisfaction to the officials here as in dicating the success of this important dip lomatic negotiation. However, It may be stated the responses of the European gov ernments have not yet reached the State Department. It Is realized thoroughly that In a matter of this Importance the negotia tions must be conducted with the greatest circumspection and deliberation. Hence it is no matter for surprise that the re sponses havo not yet been received. It is hoped that the final success of the negotia tions can be communicated to Congress in the shape of a special message from the President, accompanied by an explanatory statement from Secretary Hay, soon after the hoIIdays; The Department of Agriculture will begin its distribution of seeds a little earlier this year than last, shipping them South the beginning of January and perhaps sending a few shortly before the 1st. This year tne seeds for distribution to all parts of the country will consist of 13.OW.0uO packs of vegetable seeds. 1.5&3.000 of flower seeds, besides field and lawn grass seeds. The annual report of General F. C. Alns worth, chief of the record and pension ofllce of the War Department, shows that tho enormous business of the office has been promptly dispatched, more than 96 per cent, of the cases received during the fiscal year, aggregating 1S3.018, having been dis posed of within twenty-four hours after they reached the office, and not ono case re mained unacted upon at the close of busl ress hours at the end of the fiscal year. On the recommendation of the chief of the office a reduction of CC0 was made in .the clerical force in IS) I. a further reduction of fifty was made in 1SD, and a still further reduction of twenty-five in 1S97. In the es timates submitted by General Alnsworth for the coming year a still further reduc tion of thirty-two Is provede' for, making a total reduction of 407 clerks, representing a permanent saving of JfGO.OOO annually In the appropriations for the clerical force of the office. Adding to this the saving ef fected In contingent and other expenres. It Is shown that the cost of maintaining the office has been permanently reduced by fully $500,000 annually.

Market Conditions Offer More Attrac tions than the Government Re demption Offer Money Situation. NEW YORK, Dec. 9. United States gov ernment bonds touched, this week, the highest prices of the year. To-day's quota tions were from Uc higher for the 3 per cent, bonds, to lic higher for the four per cent, bonds of lOZo, than a week ago. It be came known, to-day, that several large in surance companies, seeking to do business in Cuba, had made heavy purchases of the bonds during the last week or ten days. Each company's deposit represents holdings of 1100,000 in the various issues, and this, with demands from other quarters, has' had an important influence in raising the price for securities above the rates named In the treasury circular. One of the most im portant bond houses pointed out to-day that the government issues were always in demand at this season, because they were exempt from taxation and persons, by buying the bonds, could easily effect a transfer of their funds so as to escape the ordinary charges. Since the government's purchases had lessened by 518,000,000 the supply of such securities, the price natu rally advanced as the demand increased. A large, dealer In government securities said It was ridiculous to suggest that blocks of government bonds were being held by per sons In this city for the purpose of forcing the treasury to increase its bid for the 4 and 5 per cent, issues, the fact being that under prevailing money market conditions it costs a half per cent, a month to hold the bonds. This precluded the posibllity of profits from such transactions and ought to dispose of the theory in the minds of well Informed persons. Another authority pointed out that if tne marKci price iur hnnHa la hicnor than tti Governments offer, the government cannot buy the bonds or continue disbursements at tnis center. The interest rata would be thus left un affected and the possibility of sterling ex- . . . t & change touching tne goia exporting pomi removed. Considering the stringency pre vailing at European money centers, such calculations might not be absent from 'the minds of financiers in more or less control of the local situation. GRIDIRON CLUB FUN. Niagara had a cargo of lumber and shin gles and was bound from Georgian bay to Buffalo. Senators Fairbanks and Beverldge Witness a Funny Initiation. WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. The December dinner of the Gridiron Club was given to night at the Arlington Hotel, where about 130 guests were entertained In character istic manner by the forty correspondents who compose the famous organization. Gen. 11. V. Boynton presided. He took part in an interesting burlesque election. In which members of the club imper sonated well-known statesmen and poli ticians, and participated in a Kentucky Philadelphia election on plans of the most exaggerated type. General Boynton was unanimously voted out, but he called In the "army" and "navy" and was again seated. The initiation of Rudolph Kauffmann, of the Evening Star, was made the text of a clever skit. The candidate appeared as "Aguinaldo," running for safety and pur sued by three members of the club repre senting Generals Lawton, MacArthur and Wheeler. "Aguinaldo" - was captured by these three "aScers" and then "General Otis," another member of the club, stalked In with military pomp and after some con versation received the report of the offi cers, each claiming to have captured the Filipino chief. After reading each report he dictated a dispatch to his "orderly," cabling Adjutant General Corbln that "the army under my command presents the Na tion, as a Christmas gift, Aguinaldo." The club took In the candidate, saying as he had done most of his fighting in the news papers he was entitled to belong to a correspondents' club. "General Otis" was presented with a "house" for his great victory. Another incident was the reading of an alleged dispatch from South Africa detail ing a great victory which the English had achieved over the Boers. This was fol lowed by a number of British soldiers run ning the whole length of the room, pur sued In a leisurely manner by "Oom Paul Kruger," who cracked his whip in great glee. There were many other features sandwiched in with the bright and witty speeches, making the entire evening one of thorough enjoyment. Among the promi nent guests present were Senators Fair banks and Beveildge, of Indiana. 

WEEKLY GERMAN BUDGET. Count Von Dnelow to Speak In the Reichstag on Tuesday. Coryrljcht. ISM, by the Associated Tress. BERLIN, Dec. 9. Next Tuesday will be a great day In the Reichstag. The budget debate will open and Count Von Buelow will make a full presentation of the pres ent status of Germany's foreign policj. He will dwell particularly on Samoa and the Transvaal and will frankly acknowledge the high value he attaches to the fully established cordial understanding between Germany, the United States and Great Britain. He will also show the need of a powerful navy. It Is probably not too much to say that President McKinley's message will have a lasting effect In cementing German-American friendship. A pronounced cordial and amicable tone toward the United States has become general in the German press. Dispatches received here to-day from Apia, Samoa, m?der. date of Nov. -7. say the news of the final settlement of the Samoan question has been hailed with sat isfaction by the German residents and a large majority of the Samoans. The dis patches add that the Malietoa Tanus people are depressed over the matter and that a majority of the English residents begrudge Germany her success. The Berlin University shows 6.473 enroi.ed students, besides 4.4S3 auditors, 120 enrolled Americans and 406 female auditors. The Emperor Is now causing the erec tion of a high iron fence behind monuments in the Sieges Alle, to protect them from mutilation. The severe cold snap continues through out Germany. In Berlin there is skating everywhere. The Emperor had special sporting at the hunt in Bacekeburg, killing sixteen stags, of which one was a slxteen-pronged. Henry J.
