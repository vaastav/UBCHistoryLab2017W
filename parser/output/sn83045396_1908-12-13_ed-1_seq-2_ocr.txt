UNABLE TO SOLVE MYSTERY N OP THE PACKAGE OF MONEY, tf Special to Tho Tribune. V OGDEN. Dec. 12, No' real solution of I ; tho mystery surrounding tho mysterious pnekage containing $2-110 in bank notes i which was received at tho Five Points . li postollico Friday 'afternoon by Charles H Price, living at 192 Second street, has r? been reached by tho postal authorities J4 who are investigating the caso. ')( When Mr. Price was seen at his homo , ho appeared not to be rho least con ' corned over tho small fortune- which K may fall to him. IIo refers to the wad M of money received by him in the news- t -paper in tho most matter of fact way. lsOf course tho money was not meant J for me," ho declared, "but I suppose it will bo mtno if nobody else comes! n forward with a claim to it. When I saw the money in the newspapor as I i ', tore off the wrapper I was so completely surprised that for a minute I could not say anything.. Then I told tho boys 1 standing around that they could not fool me with their jokes, I soon re-. y alized that they were as ignorant as I about tho money, and then I was con vinced that it was bogus. I finally de 'l cided to como to tho city and seo Mr, i.'j Piugree at tho Pingree National bank, . with whom I do business. Mr. Pingree told me the bills were real and I left tho wholo amount on deposit there un til the matter is settled. When. I tore j. opon the- package and saw the news paper was a Dcserot News I couldn t undorstaud. as I am not a subscriber. I "thought the paper was a San Fran cisco Examiner before 1 opened it, as N ' I take that paper. I was on the point of throwing it into tho coal scuttle when , ( something told mo to open it and the J ' money fell our. I don't know of any 'I other' Charles Prico living hero." ' Postmaster Albert Shaw at Five li Points was equally surprised at the I- largo amount of eurrencj' which fell ' K from the folds of the paper. ''The paper, came out with the regular after- 'i noon mail for tho Fivo Points office ' from Ogden," he said. "I had dis tributed all the sack when Mr. Price ' came up and I handed him his paper without any idea of tho big surprise which would follow the opening ol- the . jj package. The wrapper bore no letter ing except the simple address, and thorc j was .no postofiice stamp or date to tell ' from whore it was posted. 1 reported the mutter to the postal authorities just as soon 'as I recovered from my sur V ' prise." ' Charlos Price,, the, probable bone- ficiary'of tho mysterious package, is. a pla3torcr and carpenter,. He has a wife ! ' ' and" several small children and is 50 1 ' years of age, , , " Two secret service men from the . postal department are in the city and ' , ' are at work on the case. Both. the post- 14 S office at Five Points and in the city arc . being kept under close surveillance. J t .'Many theories have been advanced "v concerning the posting of the valuable 'vi package. One. theory which is coll ie Bidcred probable is tliat-the money may be a portion of loot taken by train rob k j bcra and mailed in this unusual niaii- FiJ ner when tho thief found that he was jj liable to be detected. Ii I HOTEL TELEPHONE ,W BOOTHS ARE ROBBED Xn N Continued From Pago One. t with the steel money box attachment, ljy but instead of removing them at the m time thev remedied tho matter at the m Xuutsford, tho instruments were allowed ' to romain, to the sorrow of the com- . lit puny. They will now be replaced with the "wall phones; j' Tho man is described as being about : fe-j the same ago as the woman, a little over , tfc medium height, dnrk, and wearing a tS long black overcoat and black derby. 1! It- is supposed that as soon as ho had w removed tho telephone ea&h box he , ift slipped it under his coat, despite the .If- fact .that they arc vary heavy, and as- rjjM suming to place his hand in his over- nl .coat pocket, carried the prize away as va easily as one could a bundle. Tho vSw "boxes happen to bo fitted with a steel , handle, and this made it vastly easier ' f5 to carry the box than othorwiso would jl have been the cat-e. The boxes taken are supposed to have contained in nick- ?n els, dimes and quarters in tho noigh- i "borhood of $30 each. U From tips which had been received here, it is believed this is the fcamo if- pair which has been operating in Spo m kanc, Seattle. Portland, San Francisco, In Sacramento and .Denver. A few days )kj ago Detective Leonard Do Lue of Dcn- vh vcr was in this .city, and although it IjU was said by him that he was merely Pi k liere on a vacation, it was believed at I Jn tho time that he was in quest of some- ( V body. This is low considered certain, im ' as it has become known that ho was jl looking for tho couple who had been I '? touching tlje telephone company in - Denver and the hotels as well.

WILL PUSH FIGHT TO CHANGE RULES Continued From Pago One. ton of Alabama; Hughes, Now Jorsoy, and Do Armond, Missouri. In tho opinion of Mr. Henry it was going too far "to tako a circuitous route and confer on aliens rights which havo not been conferred on them b3' tho constitution." Tho bill was loo radical, ho said. Alien Has a Bemody. Mr. Clayton Kaid thero was not an alien' in tno country who had not al readv a romed3' in caso ho is injured or threatened. Mr. Sherloy took issue with Mr. Henry, and said thoro was no law granting tho aliens rights su perior to citizons. After further discussion tho bill was passed. 100 to 99. The voto was so closo that the speaker ordered a re capitulation at tho suggestion of Mr. Henry, Texas. This disclosed that tho voto actually stood 100 to 100. Tho tio was broken by the voto of the speaker in the affirmative, which' again passed the bill.' Mr. Do Armond challenged tho speak er's vote on the ground that ho had no right to cast it after tho voto had been closed. Ho contended that tho only duty of tho speaker in such a caso was to announco tho rostilt of tho re capitulation. In an claboralo decision, supported by precedents which ho read, tho speaker held that ho had the absolute right to vote, and ho declared that his voto would stand. From tho spcakor's decision Mr. Do Armond appealed, but in tho mcnutimo Mr. Jenkins movod to ad.iourn. On that proposition a roll call was forced, reso lution aj-eB 99; nays, 95 j and the house accordingly at 5:27 adjourned. HARD TO FORECAST WHAT SENATE WILL DO WASHINGTON. Doc. 12 Tho action to be taken by tho Senate in nsserting its displeasure becauso of President Roosevelt's messngo in regard to the secret service, has "not been outlined with any defiuitcness. It has been un derstood that a resolution would bo of- fercd by somo Democratic Sonator pro viding ior an investigation by the coin- ( mittco on appropriaions of tho. prcsi ; dent's language. It was argued that I as a Republican introduced a rcsolu- I tion in the House, tho selection of a I Democrat for tho same purposo in the Senate would give a nonpartisan flavor to the course being pursued. Conferences today developed .that a number of" lenders believe the action should be taken br a Republican, and it was suggested that Senator' Burrows would be tho proper person to offer tho resolution. Senator Burrows has not yet consented to do so. It is likely that tho resolution will be tho same as that of the House, providing for the appointment of a select committco of fhfo to consider the wholo subject. It is evident that tho House does not intend to take any hnsty action in re buking tho president for'the statements in his message regarding the civil service action of the Congress. Tho com mittee appointed yesterday, of which Mr. Perkins of Now York is chairman, did not meet today, but is expected to cqme together on Monday. The under standing is, however, that no report will be made until the latter part of the week. The members of tho select committee are determined to present their recommendations boforo adjourn ment before the Christmas holiday.
