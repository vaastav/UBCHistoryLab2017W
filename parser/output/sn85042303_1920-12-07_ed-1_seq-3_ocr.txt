TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1920. DAILY ARDMOREITE PAGE THREE .. ft. RKSIDRNT WllOVS ME8. SAGK TO TUB 66TH CONGRESS (Continued From Page One) ,L.on(l of the war came when the Oer- iiiuu peopiu iouiiu inemseivea race 10 face with the conscience of the world ana realized that right was everywhere arrayed against thu wrong that, their Kovernment waa perpetrating. Thou, therefore, it is right to nay this wan thu faith which won the war. Cer tainly this la the faith with which our Kullaiit men went into tho firld ami out upon the seas to mako buro of victory... This !h Uie mission upon which de mocracy catno into the world. Democracy is an assertion of thu riKlit of tho Individual to live and to be treated Justly as against any attempt on tho part of any combina tion of 'Individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy' his equality among; his fel lows in the matter of right or privi lege, and I think that we all realize that the day has come when democ racy is being put upon its final test. The old world is Just now suffer ing from a wanton rejection of tho principle of democracy and a substitu tion of tho principle of autocracy ns asserted in the name, hut without the authority and sanction of the multitude. This in the time of all others, when democracy should prove its purity and its splrltunl power to prevail. . It Is surely the manifest destiny of the United Slates to lead In the attempt to make this spirit prevail. . There nre two ways in which the l ulled States can assist to accorn- pIlHh this (treat object. First, by offering the example with in her own borders of the will and power of democracy to make and en force luws which nre unquestionably Just and which nre equal In their ad ministration laws which secure its full right to labor and yet, at the H.'nne time, safeguard tho. integrity i'f pmperty and piirticulnrly of that property which is devoted to the do wliipinent nf Industry and the ln 'creaso of the necessary wealth of the world. Second, by standing for right and Justice ns towards individual nations. The law of democracy Is for the pro tection of the weak, and In the Influ ence of every democracy In tho world should be for the protection of the weak nations, the nation which Is struegling towards its rights and to ward its proper recognition and privi lege in the family of natlonB. The United Stntes cannot refus this role of champion without putting the stlgmn of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought Its government into existence and estab lished it In the face of almost uni versal opposition and Intrigue, even In the face of wanton force, as, for example, agnlnst the orders in coun cil of Great Britain and the arbi trary Napoleonic elements which In volved us In what we knew as the war of 1812. I urge you to consider that the display of an Immediate disposi tion on the part of congress to remedy any injustices or evils that may have shown themselves In our own national life Will nfford the most effectual nffsct to the forces of chaos and ty ranny which nre playing so disastrous u part In the fortunes of the free peoples of more than one part of th world. The United Slates Is of necessity the sample democracy of the world, and the triumph of democracy depends H'ipon Its success. n F.. 1. ,. ,lli.t.V.Iic find Itecover) mini iih- inmui w.np, sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow cn Ihe olher side of ihe water and has given promise.

I reluctantly vetoed the hud i:et bill passed by tho last session of tho congress because of n constitu tional objection. The house of representative sub senuently modified ihe bill in order to meet this objection. In the revised form f licllcve thnt tee bill. oupl"d with action already taken by the cen tres to revise Its rules end proced ure, furnishes the foundations for on effective national budget system, t earnestly hope, trust, thnt one of the first Steps taken by the present ses sion Of tho congres will he to pass the budget bill. The nation's finances have shown marked Improvement during the pnst ear. The total ordinary receipts of tn.CHOnO.OAO, for the fiscal yonr 1920 exceeded those for 1919 by I1.S42, nan while the total net ordtnnry ex penses from IU.514.000.000 to $M3. (WO.flOO.

Tills fortunate result hns relieved the banks and left them freer to fi nance Ihe needs of Bgrlculture. In- lustry and commerce. It has been due In large part to the reduction of the public debt, especially of ths flnnilnir debt, but more particularly o the Improved distribution of gov ernment securities among permanent Investors. The cessation of th. fov ernments borrowing except through lOiort term certificates of Indebtedness n-.iiT i- I' ll- ut has been a matter of grout conse quence to the people of the country at largo as well or the holders of lib erty bonds and victory notes, and has had an important bearing on tho matter of effective credit control. The year has been characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the treas ury from the domestic 'credit market and from a position of dominant in flucuco in tliut market. Tho future course will necessarily depend upon thu extent to which economies are profiled una upon the burdens placed upou tho treasury, im well as upon Industrial developments aud tho main tenance of taJt receipts at u suffi ciently hljfh level. The fundamental fact which at present dominates tho government's fi nancial situation is that seven and a half billions of its war indebted ness mature within tho next two ftnd a hulf years. Of this amount, two and a half billions are floating debt and five billions victory notes and war savings certificates. The fiscal program of the government must bo determined with reference to these maturities. Sound policy demands that Uie government expenditures be re duced to the lowest amount which will permit the various service to operate efficiently and that government ro celpts from taxes and salvage be maintained sufficiently high td pro vide for current requirements, includ ing interest and sinking fund charge on the publics debt and at the samo time retire the floating debt and part With rigid, vigorous salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation a surplus of current receipts over current expenditures can. be released and should bo applied to the floating debt. All branches of the government should co-operate to see that this program is realized. I cannot over emphasize the necessity of economy In government expenditures and prac tices which take money from the treasury by Indefinite or revolving fund appropriations. The estimates for the presont year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were authorized by the last congress in ac cordance with the amounts showed in annual compiled statements of appropriations. This strikingly illustrates the im portance of making direct and spe cific appropriations. The relations be tween the current receipts and current expenditures of the government during the present fiscal year us well us dur ing the last hiiJJ of the last fiscal year has been distributed by the ex traordinary burdens thrown upon the treasury act, In accordance with the return of the railroads to private control. Over $600,000,000 has already been paid upon the railroads and this act $350,000,000 during the present fiscal year; and it is estimated that further payments aggregating approx imately $050,000,000 must still be mode to the railroads during the current year. It is obvious that these large payments have already seriously lim ited the government's progress in re tiring the floating debt. Closely connected with this, it seems to me, is the necessity 'for an imme' diato consideration of the revision of our tax table. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immedi ate necessity. These taxes performed an Indispensable service during the war. The need for their simplifica tion, however, is vpry great, in order to save the tax payer inconvenience anil expense and in order to mako his liability more certain and definite. Other and nioro detailed recommenda tions with regard to taxes will no doubt he laid before you by the secre- i liirv of f)ie treiiMiirv find the eommiM- sioner of internnl revenue. It Is my privilege to draw to the nttention of congress for every sym pathy considcralon tho problem of providing adequate facilities for the ' care nnd treatment of former members I of tlio military and naval forces which I are sick or disabled as a rusult of j their participation in the war. I These heroic men can never be paid t In money for the service they pa triotically rendered tile nation. .Their i reward will lie rather In realization ! of the fact that they vindicated the . rights of their country and aided in safeguarding civilization. Tho nations ! gratitude must be effectively revealed to them by the most ample provision , fur their medical care and treatment as well lis for their vocational train- Ing iiinl placement. The time hay come when a more complete program ; can be formulated anil more satisfac i torily administered for their treatment ' and training, and I earnestly urge , that Ihe congress give, the matter its I early consideration. The secretary of the treasury and ! the board for vocational education will i outline in their annual reports pro I posals covering medical cure and re- habllitatlon, which I tun sure will en I gas' your earnest study nnd com ! m uni your most generous support. 1 Permit me to emphusir.e once more the need for uctlon upon certain mat ters upon which I dwelt at some length In my message to tho second session of the sixty-sixth congress. i The necessity for example, of encour t using the manufacture of dyc-tuffs i and related chemicals; tho Importance of doln-; everything possible to pro mote agricultural production along economic lines, to Improve agricultur al marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful; the ned for a law regulating cold stor age in such a way as to limit the time durlug which goods may be kept In storage, prescribing the meth od of disposing of them if kept be yond the M-rmltted period and requir ing good released from storage In nil cases lo bear the date of their receipt. They .will ulso be more serviceable If it wag provided that all goods re leased from cold storage from inter state shipment should have plainly marked upon each package tho sell ing or' market price at whleh they went Into storage, In order that tho purchaser might be utile, to learn what profits stiSKl between him nnd the producer or the wholesale dealer. In deed It would bo very serviceable to tha public If the goods destined for Interstate commerco were made to carry upon every pnekngo case whose form made It possible a plain state ment of what left the hands of the producer, I respectfully call your at tention also to tho recommendations of the message referred to with re Hard to n federal license for nil those engaged In interstate commerce. In brief, tho Immediate reed Is the removal of all obstacles to tho reali sation of the best ambitions of our peopls In their severs I classes of em ployment and tha strengthening of all I rUNlK NlXJVE GOT (s NEKVE.PERl, "0 ..

Try them. instrumentalities by which difficulties are to be met and removed nnd justice dealt out, whether by law or by some form of meditation and conciliation. 1 do not feel It to be my privilege nt present to suggest the detailed and particular methods by which these objects may be attained, but I have faith that the Inquiries of several committees will discover the way and the method. In response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout tho United States, I earn estly suggest that the congress au thorize the treasury of the United States to mako to the struggling gov ernment of Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the other al lied governments during the war; and I would also suggest that it would be desirable to provide in the legisla tion itself that tho expenditure of the money thus loaned bo under the sup ervision of a commission or at least a commissioner from the United States in order that the revolutionary ten dencies within Armenia itself might not be afforded by the loan a further tempting opportunity. Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of tho Phil ippine Islands have succeeded in main taining a stable government since the last action of tho congress in their behalf and have thus fulfilled the con dition set by the congress as prece dent to a consideration of granting independence to the islands. I re spectfully submit this condition pre cedent having been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them the inde pendence which they so honorably covet. I have not so much laid before you a wries of recommendations, gentle men, as sought to utter a confession of faith, of tho faith in which I was bred and which it is my solemn pur pose to stand by till my last fight ing day. I believe this to bo the faith of America, the faith of the future, nnd of the victories which await national execution in the days to come whether in America or elsewhere.

FAMILY IN NKKD KKCKIYKS 1 1 KM" HKKK CAUSE OF DESERTION Washington, Dec. 7. Drunkenness continued to be the principal cause for enlisted men of the navy for de sertion or overstaying leave during the past fiscal year, according to the unnual report of Hear Admiral George R. Clark, judge advocate general, to Secretary Daniels today. Of 1,723 such excuses during the year, pleas of drunkenness were entered in 384 cuses, says the report. The excuse of "having a good time" was given in 3C2 cases. Home sickness caused 90 sailors to take "French leave," and in eight cases the plea was entered that the work on board ship was too hard. More than 41,000 cases were tried by court martial during tho year. The tempering of Justice with mercy was urged by Admiral Clark. i , WANTED, SOME ONE TO IIAIX OFF THE SLOP. APPLY AKDMORE HOTEL.
