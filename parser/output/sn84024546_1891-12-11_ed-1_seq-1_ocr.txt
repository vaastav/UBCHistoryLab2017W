Bcueau of The Dispatch. ) WASHHtoiror, D. C, Dec. 10. Speaker Crisp is not spreading his confidences around piomiscuously just at present, but enough has been intimated in the past 24 hours to indicate what will be his policy in the important matter of tariff reform. It seem1! now pretty well assured that Mr. Springer, of Illinois, and not Mr. Mills.will be the head of the "Ways and Means Committee ior the next two years. The significance of this is that the purpose of the Speaker is to have tariff reform, without substituting an entirely new measure for the McKinley act. It is known that Mr. Mills favors action by this Congress in the shape of a compre hensive revision of the tariff on the lines of tho former Mills bill. It is of course understood that such a measure, no matter how favorably received by the House, would not pass the Senate, nor be approved by President Harrison. But it would de fine the tariff istue specifically as it exists between the two parties, and upon these lines the Presidental battle of next year would be fonght. Springer's Ideaof aNeTrTarlfrBlIl. Mr. Springer is committed to another plan, namely, the parage of separate bills to reach what he regards as proper to be repealed in the McKinley act atthissession, but to proceed carefully in the preparation of a general bill. "My Met of a tariffbill," lie said to-day, "is to have the Committee on -Manufactures sub-divide itself into commjttees, and make a tour of the country early next year, collecting information respecting all manu facturers and the respect in which they are benefited by protection, or by the introduc tion of the free raw material. After all this infoimation has been gathered it can be passed over to the "Ways and Means Committee, and used in formulating a tariff bill that can be prepared during the recess and be ready for presentation at the lirst day of the next Fession. If the elections, which will then have passed, result in Re publican success, w e will not present the bill. If, on the other hand, a Democratic President is elected, as I think one will be, we will push the measure at once. ".Inpuficlu-ers to Ho Cotiulted. "I think the Committee on Manufactures, with able in estimators on it, should consist of IS members, tea Democrats and five Re publicans. This would make five sub-com-m'ttees of three each. They should divide the work, one investigating textile indus tries, another iron production, another glassware and pottery, and so on. This committee would be a sort of adjunct to the Waj s and Means. Committee, whicli could go on with its work, and then subsequently get all the testimony without a long list of hearings. "These sub-committees could go on dur ing the session and also during the recess. Their inquiries should not be conducted with a spirit of hostility toward the manu facturers, but with a view to ascertain the bottom facts, and ascertain in each case what, If any, degree of protection is needed, as I have a suspicion that frequently it is represented that they need a great deal more protection than is really the case. Information to Fight Tariff With. "It should be ascertained what is the labor cost on things produced; the wages paid; whether the work be steady or not; the profits on actual capital and not on 'watered' stock; the relative cost of pro duction here and abroad; whether there are tacit or direct agreements to limit pro duction, and much more information of a practical character. This information is not now to be had. The party could then fight the McKinley bill."' It is assumed that Mr. Springer reflects the position of the Speaker. The sug gestion of Mr. Springer was made bv friends ofthe Speaker, who seemed inclined to sound public sentiment before appointing a Chairman of the Ways and Means Commit tee. So fjr there has been general ap proval, and the Speaker feels that his choice will satisfy the party. 1 Iit 31111s Is Not Counted in It. Mr. Mills does not appear to desire the place, his ambition being now directed to ward the United States Senate. Early in the spring the Texas Legislature will be called to elect a successor to Senator Reagan, resigned, whose seat is now filled by the Governor's appointee, Senator Chil ton. Mr. Mills expects to oe cnosen to rep resent his State in the Senate. To place him at the head of the "Ways and Means Committee of the House, with a reasonable expectation that he would be able to serve but a short time in that capacity, would in vite complications and embarrassments when it came to transfer the work of the committee to other hands- From the manner in which he has started out it is evidently the purpose, of Speaker Crisp to conduct his office on a broad, na tional basis. As rpidly as possible he is informing himself on the views of the new members regarding what are known as tho general issues. His office at the Capitol ii practically open to all comers, and 'there ii no exclusion ofthe humbler members of his party or of those who opposed him in his canvass. He is honestly endeavoring to get the sense of the country through the mem bers of the House. A Change In Committee Naming. Speaker Crisp is discussing with the older members a scheme which will embrace a, change in the practice relating to the ap pointment of a Committee on. Rules. The practice has been to have this committee composed of fire members, the Speaker being the chairman ex-officio, and the other two members of the majority being the chairman of the "Ways and Means Com mittee and the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. This practically put the control ofthe business in the hands ot these three persons. It is suggested and the suggestion comes from the Speaker that a Committee on Rules be created, composed of a reasonably lnrge number of the members, and these will, for legislative purposes, be the equiva lent of the steerinir committee. Under such an arrangement the party leaders would share with tho Speaker in the control of legislation. The result would doubtless be beneficial, and if the Speaker can satisfy himself that such an arrangement would facilitate business the experiment will be tried. Other Novelties Contemplated. Another change tlfat is in contemplation relates to appropriations. There are many appropriations, such as for rivers and har bors, the naval establlshmentacriculture, etc., which are not passed upon by the Ap propriations Committee, but by the com mittees having those special matters in charge. The separation of the appropria tion bills wasdone some years since, to cur tail Mr. Randall's power when he was at the head of the Appropriations Committee. The apparent effect has been to increase the aggregate appropriations. It is proposed to reunite these separated appropriations by having them all restored to the regular Appropriations Committee, which will be presided over by Mr. Hol man, of Indiana. "With the mention of that name no more need be said. His platform is to reduce the appropriations 5100,000,000 from what they were last year. Evident Purpose ofthe New Speaker. The above comprises the principal changes which the Speaker is now considering. Nothing has been definitely determined upon, and the newly elected presiding officer of the House is open to receive sug gestions from any quarter. He is carrying no revenges with him, but seems to be ds sirou9 of impressing the country that the Democracy is a national and not a sectional party. One of the first subjects to occupy the at tention of the Foreign Affairs Committee, after the organization of the. committees of the House by Speaker Crisp, says the corre spondent of the Associated Press, will be that of hari treatment of Hebrews by Russia. This question will b; earnestly pressed upon the attention of the commit tee, and it will be urged to go ns far as pos sible in cvprcssinc its sympathy with the Russian Hebrews in their distress, and to take sucli measures, consonant with the usages of diplomacy, as will tend to secure. u auicuuruiiuu ui lueir cuuuiuua. xms Government will be asked to continue the use of its good offices as an intercessory with the Czar in behalf of the Hebrews. Dea! In Line With the Message. The President in his message devoted some space to the question of wholesale banishment of Hebrews from Russia, and to the endeavors which this Government had thus far put forth in their behalf. The sub- I ject will be brought to the attention of the committee, prooaDiy y me miroaucuon oi a formal resolution, but the customary dis tribution of the various portions of the President's message will bring the matter before the committee in the absence of any resolution whatever. Representative Rayner, of Maryland,wbo was one ot the more prominent of the new members of the House in the Fiftieth Con gress, said this morning that he should not feck the chairmanship of any committee, but that he earnestly desired a position as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He tool: a deep interest in the question of the Russian treatment of the Hebrews, and wished to be in a position where he could do the most effective work. He did not think his Coneressional experience entitled him to a chairmanship when there were older members in his State Congressional delegation, and he would be content with his two rocmittee assignments in the Fif tieth Congress, namely, places on the For eign Afiairs and Commerce Committees. An Idle Day 1 ilh Congressmen. About two score members of Congress were in and about the House of Represent athesthis morning, answering correspond ence, chattering, and listening to appeals for office and considering the now-absorbing topic of committee assignments. The House not being in session, it was comparatively an idle day for the members, but for the new Speaker it was one of arduons and un remitting toil. Mr. Carlisle, when he became Speaker, departed from the custom of selecting mem bers of the Committee on Rules regardless of their committee assignments, and made its membership go as a matter of course to the chairmen of the two most important committees, namelv, "Ways and Means and Appropriations. Speaker Reed followed the same course. The previous Speakers, Messrs. Randall and Keifer, had selected the Rules Committee with regard to other considerations. Messrs. Blackburn and Alexander H. Stephens being the former's associates and having otherwise special committee prominence. A number of Dem ocratic Congressmen urge a return to this policy, and represent that its effect would be to strengthen the Speaker. Keeping In Touch A itji His Party. The "Ways and Means and Appropriations Committees now have prior rights under the rules over other committees, and with their respective chairmen on the Rules Committee, which is the guiding or "steer ing" body of the nouse, the result is repre sented to'bc disastrous to other committees, whose business may be important. Mem bership on this Rules Committee, it is urged, should be high enough honor with out other committee assignments except of a very Ordinary character, such as the chairmanship perhaps of some minor com mittee. Moreover, as the chairmen of the two principal committees would be the managers of work originating with their committees, the Speaker would have these men as his active lieutenants in fiscal and revenue affairs, and the Rules 'Committee members as lieutenants in other proposed legislation, and altogether would have n excellent opportunity to keep thoroughly in touch with his party. It has been presumed that ex-Speaker Reed would be one of the minority repre sentatives on the Rules Committee, but under this policy such, perhaps, would not be the case, as Mr. Reed might prefer to lead the minority of the Commit tee on "Ways and Means. There are two sides, however, to the proposed method of constituting the Rules Committee, and the Speaker also heard the objections that were urged against the plan. The King or Gxoeoa lias Smallpox. Athens, Dec. 10. The illness from which King George is suffering, which was at first stated to be chicken pox, is now pro nounced smallpox. 

HOPES rlUBERTY Held Out to Mrs. Maybrick, the Fair American Now in an English Jail, BY HER NOBLE MOTHEB. An Affecting Meeting, in Which the Prospects Are Talked Over. MB. MAEIUS MAKES ADMISSIONS, The St John Divorce Case Enlivened fcy Evidence of Quarrels. ENGLISH EDITORS JDMP ON OUR BEN London, Dec. 10. One of tho seldom granted privileges to life prAners in Brit ish prisons was allowed to-day to Mrs. Flor ence Maybrick, the American woman who is serving in Woking Prison a sentence of life imprisonment on the charge of poison ing her husband, James Maybrick, a Liver pool merchant. This privilege was permis sion for her to receive a visitor from the outside world. For months this young woman has been immured in her dreary prison, and her feel ings may be better imagined than describ'cd as the time approached for her to gaze into the face of a friend and to hear something of what was going on outside of the walls. The time allowed by the prison regulations is but an hour. As the time for a friend to visit the pris oner approached, Baroness Caroline de Roque, the mother of Mrs. Maybrick, left her home in Rouen, France, and came to England. She at once proceeded to "Woking, and as soon as the officials allowed her to do so she entered the prison, andjn, a short time wasJe'r;nltt&.lo!3lurtlaughter., Holding Ont Hope for-Xlberty. Theh-meotinjr was most affectionate, and though the visit was made in the presence of a prison officer, the Baroness conveyed to her daughter intelligence of tbe efforts being made to restore her to her children and 'the world. She told her of the money that had been contributed by tbe people of the United States to pay counsel to procure her release, and of the Manchester fund which has been raised for the same purpose. 'J.he pale face of the beautiful convict lighted up with joy as she heard ofthe sym pathy of the women of America for her. Milch passed between the mother and daughter that does not concern the, outside worm. Y nen me prison omcer notiuea tne Baronness that her hour was up, and that she must leave the prison, she and her daughter, amid tears and sobs, tenderly em braced and kissed each other. The Baron ness then withdrew, and Mrs. Maybrick re sumed her usual prison employment. Caunot Endure Her Prison Fare. After the Baronness de Roque had left the prison she was interviewed regarding Mrs. Maybrick by a reporter. The Baronness said she found her daughter looking ill. She is intensely weak, and frequently an inmate of the prison hospital. She is unable to sleep, or to eat the coarse food given to the pris oners. During the course of their short con versation to-day Mrs. Maybrick said in de spairing tones to her mother: "I have done nothing. Nothing has been proved against me. "Why do they keep me here? Is it because I am apoor, little Amer ican girl? I cannot understand why they will not give mercy or pardon, and let you take me away. I feel deeply grateful to my American friends for all they have done in my behalf." Baroness de Roque said that Mr. Mat thews, the Home Secretary, and the prison officials always gave her the greatest facil ities when she "visited the prison. She de clared that Mrs. Maybrick is treated with the utmost courtesy by those in whose charge she is. Mr. liumley, tne solicitor, nas nad and is still having many conferences with Sir Charles Russell to "discuss new points in re lation to arsenic and arsenical poisoning. These points were not submitted at Mrs. Maybrick's trial. They are regarded as having such an important bearing on the case that both Mr. Lumley and Sir Charles Russell believe they will be sufficient to bring about the release of Mrs. Maybrick. A CASE OF MOTHER-IN-LAW, Mr. Marios Talks on the Stand or His Quarrel "With Miss St. John. London, Dec. 10. Mr. Marius, the de fendant in the St. John divorce suit, was still on ibe stand to-day. He denied the testimony given by Miss St, John that he had thrown his watch at her. He said he and his wife had had a quarred and he be came so angry that he threw the watch on the floor and smashed it. He denied most emphatically that he had slapped his wife's face or pushed her. The witness admitted that once, after a quarrel with his wife, he .tried to force his way ont of the door, threatening to leave the house. He said his first wife had been divorced from him on the grounds of immorality and de sertion. Mr. Marius declared that if it were not for Miss St John's mother and brother he and his wife could live happily together. He denied that he went to the Gaiety The ater and demanded 100 from his" wife. He hid no need of asking for that or any other sum. HOI BH0T FOB HABBIS0N.

In the meantime, the calculations of tbe supporters of the McKin ley bill are working out much better than anyone in England had reason to expect. The Globe sarcastically comments on the message, which it says is adroitly' traced on catch-vote lines. In some passages spread eagleism is served up hot: in others nervous J Yankees are assured that the Government knows how to climb down, as. in the cases ot Chile and the Bering Sea dispute. Lord Salisbury, the Globe adds, need not be much frightened at President Harrison's tre mendous menace and expression cf 'concern at foreign encroachments on territories con trolled by American Governments. If Venezuela passed uuder American control, the least that could be expected would be that the suzerain power would forthwith guarantee the Venezuelan debt. The Globe disputes the statement made in the message that the prosperity of the United States is entirely due to the McKinley bill. On the contrary, ,it says the prosperity of the country is' due to an exceptional harvest there at a time when Europe is short of grain. 

KHXED AND BOBBED HEE 805. An Awful Doable Tragedy In a tittle Tillage in Austria. Vienna, Dec. 10. The son of, a" peasant couple living in Wieselburg recently re turned to them after an absence of 16 years in America. He was much changed in looks, and, thinking to give his parents a pleasant surprise later on, did not disclose his identity, supposing that neither of them recognized him. This sup position was correct as regarded his mother, but his father recognized him, although he concealed the fact. The seeming stranger's request ior en tertainment was granted, and during a con versation which followed he showed his en tertainers the contents of a bag in which he carried 600 sovereigns. The sight violently aroused the peasant wo man's " covetousness, and - after her supposed lodger had retired for the night and was asleep, she cut his throat in order to secure the money. "When told by her husband that she hod not killed the stranger, but her own son, the shock she experienced was so great that she herself fell dead. KILLED BY A CORPSE. THE DEATH GRIP OF A WOMAN STB AN GLBS HEK MOTHER, Strange Affair That Occnrred In a Western Hamlet An Aged and Foeblo Woman's Terrlblo Fate The Awful Discovery Mado by Her Elderly Son. Cincinnati, Deo 10. Special. One of the strangest affairs occurred.Jast night at Elizabethtown, an insignificant hamlet on the Ohio river, ten miles below this city. The McDole family has lived for years in the most abject poverty. The mother is past 80. Besides her the family consists of son and daughter, each about 60 years of age. The son is a veteran, and greatly en feebled by wounds received in the war and aggravated by insufficient and indifferent food. Mother and daugnter slept together, the mother being very feeble. The daughter was the most robust ofthe three. The family retired as usual, lost night, and the son noticed nothing out of the ordinary, until early this morning, when groans from ".his; mother's room,calleuhim,ther.to"vtitnessA blood curdJing-sigut. ' " During the night the sister had been taken mortally ill. In her despair she had caught her aed' mother in her arms and pinioned her tight against her breast. At the same time the mother's head had been pulled down under the covers and partly bent downward, causing partial suffocation. The horror of the situation had caused her to faint, and while thus unconscious the daugh ter had died, hugging the mother. The icy arms had stiffened and the aged victim was held as if in a vise. Help was summoned, but it required the united strength of two men to remove the dead woman's arms and release the mother, who is so low from the shock and choking she re ceived that it is scarcely probable she.-can recover. SABGENPS F0BTBAIX 01 TOM HEED Attractlns More Attention Than Anything Else Now In the Capitol. Washington, Dec. 10. Serial. Sar gent's oil painting of ex-Speaker Reed at tracts more attention at present than any thing about the Capitol. To-day the por trait was removed a few feet from its former location, and now hangs between the crayon pictures of ex-Speakers Randall and Car lisle. Almost every member of both Houses of Congress has been to inspect it, and hun dreds of visitors stand before it daily, giv ing their opinions as to its value as a like ness and a work of art. The opinions vary widely, but' the con sensus seems to be that the portrait is most artistic, even if the likeness is not as cor rect as it ought to be. The chief criticism is that the expression of Mr. Reed's face is one that those who have seen him in the House are not familiar with, and there is no doubt this criticism is well founded. A

HARBISON'S BOOMERS TAKING HEART rSrECIAL TOLXOIUIT TO THE CISr-ATCTT.1 Columbus, O., Dec. 10. State Auditor Poe .returned to-day from Washington, where he called upon and had two inter views with Secretary Blaine. Mr. Poe says so far as Blaine's physical condition is con corned, he will be abundantly able for the fatigue of a Presidental campaign, and that the cry of ill-health cannot of itself oper ate to prevent his nomination, if he is will ing to accept. Mr. Poe is disinclined to ex press an opinion as to the probabilities in the matter, however. "I found," he said, "that Mx. Blaine's memory, which has always beon exceptional, remained good. He recalled having met me in 1884, during his Presidental campaign. He was passing through the State en route to Detroit, and I boarded the train on which he was traveling at one of the stations in Wood county. It was the day before our State election, which was then held in Oc tober. I introduced Mr. Blaine to the crowds that gathered at a couple of stations at which the train stopped, and he urged them to be loyal to their party, telling them that as Ohio went in October the country would go in November. Blaine Says He Was Counted Out. "Mr. Blaine spoke of this incident of his trip as familiarly as though it. had occurred but yesterday, and he also talked quite freely of other matters pertaining to his campaign. He made the remark that he was counted out in New York. This opin ion is, of course, shared by many who have not the same information on the subject that Mr. Blaine has. "I rode out from Washington in company with Congressman J. D. Taylor, and we be came acquainted with a Dakota gentleman who was a Democrat. We got to discuss ing Blaine, and the Dakotan said to us that he did not think the Democrats could nominate anyone able to defeat Blaine next year. He believed that he would unify and enthuse the wavering Republicans of the Northwestern States-.as. j,, no. othr man could.' ij- --$y??'.r' "Sc' , Ehepard's 'Paper Keeps K Up. The Now York Mail and Express has the following this afternoon from Chicago: "The Washington dispatch yesterday foreshadowing an authoritative announce ment of Secretary Blaine's future course In regard to the Presidental nomination has attracted a great deal of attention here to day. It was telegraphed from New York to all the morning papers and reprinted here this morning. Substantiating as it does the frequent publications of the rela tions and understanding existing between President Harrison and his Cabinet chief, yesterday's publication is regarded here as virtually takinir Mr. Blaine out ofthe race. as certainly as did his celebrated letter from Florence to B. F. Jones in Februarv, 1888. "Chicago is full of ambitious people, politically as well as in other ways, and with hundreds knocking at tne doors of only a score of public offices it is no wonder that President Harrison has had to decide in a way that has left heartburning and dis appointments rankling in many breasts. Hence the movement against his renomina tion, which the disgruntled ones started some months ago in many parts of the country, under the guise of a Blaine boom, has had some support here. Dismay Among- Blaine's Friends. "It can be imagined, therefore, how great was the consternation among them to-day when they read the Washington special. It was a bombshell in their midst, for despite the frequent warnings they have had that Mr. Blaine could not be made a consolation candidate for disappointed office-seekers, they have continued their efforts to drag him into a position of disloyalty to his chief, and nothing short of such" announce ment as that made yesterday could make any impression upon them. To-day, how ever, they find themselves in the position of boomers with nothing to boom, and some of the more discreet among them are beginning to fall into line with dominant sentiment here that Presi dent Harrison is entitled to a renomination. Thev now realize that it would be political suicide to stand in the way of the time-honored custom of the party to reward work well done, whether of the chief magistrate ofthe nation or ofthe lowest officer in their own local government at home. "Here in Illinois the unselfish and patri otic Republicans who want to win the great battle of next year are as solidly arrayed in favor of President Harrison's nomination, as in New York and other Eastern States. They are not trumpeting the necessity for him in the Democratic and Mugwump newspapers, but they recognize that the masses of the party are for him and stnnd with them in favor of his renomination." 

STANDING BY PROHIBITION. Iowa Temperance Folks Urge Republicans to Stick to Their Pledges. Des Moines, Dec 10. The fate of pro hibition in this State is a matter of con cern with politicians and people at the pres ent time, and a meeting of the Executive Committee of the State Temperance Alli ance was held here to-day. The result of the meeting is the issuance of an address to the people of the State of Iowa, declaring their loyalty to prohibition, and expressing a belief that the election was not a repudiation of prohibition. The address says that the Republican members of the General Assembly cannot go back on the platform on which they were elected, and also asserts that all votes against Boies were prohibition votes, ana that therefore the majority ofthe State is for prohibition. The address further says that prohibition has been a source of otrength to the Repub lican party, and expresses the belief that the Constitutional amendment of 1882 was legally addpted, and, further, that the Su preme Court will finally so declare. The address closes by urging all temperance people to renewed activity for the enforce ment of the laws. San Francisco Wants the Convention. SAN Francisco, Dec 10.

Collector Warmcastle's friends who are confirmed in the opinion that the Collector must either-resign his office or be turned out, are already booming Mr. Warmcastle for Congress in Mr. Dalzell's district. They believe that in their fight for Warmcastle ior Congress they will have the assistance of both Quay and Macee. Many of -the workers who heretofore were opposed to Mr. Warmcastle are now in the field work ing for him for Congress. A telegram from Washington last night said: "Collector Warmcastle called upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue just before the department closed this after noon There had been some sort of an un derstanding that he would be informed at that time as to what disposition the Presi dent would make of his case. It trans pired, however, that the President had not reached a decision, or at least was not pre pared to announce one at that time. The Commissioner intimated that the Pres ident .and himself would probably hold another conference before final action w'ould be made public '.'On all hands it is rumored that Mr. Warmcastle will have to go This seems to emenatefrom the Internal Revenue Bureau, but official confirmation is withheld. An additional rumor has gained circulation (that the successor of Collector Warmcastle will be ex-Collector Frank Case, and that the appointment will be dictated by Con gressman Dalzell. In that event it is inti mated that Senators Quay and Cameron would appeal to Senatorial courtesy and have the nomination held up." 

SOKE FREIGHT RATES REDUCED. Important Action Taken by tho Central Traffic Association. Chicago, Dec 10. Special. The freight department of the Central Traffic Association has authorized the Pacific Com pany to reduce class and commodity rates between Chicago and various Indiana and Ohio points to the same basis now in effect between those points and Cleveland, in order that the company may forward traffic to and from Cleveland over its own route via Alliance. Chairman Blanchard was re-quested-to arrange an early meeting oflines interested in ice traffic for the purpose of fixing winter rates on ice from the various producing points to points in the territory of the association. It was decided that the same rates may be applied from Chicago to Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, Mich., that are in effect from Benton Harbor and St. Joseph to Chi cago. These are: First-class, 22 cents; sec ond, 18; third, 13; fourth, 10; fifth, 8; sixth. 7; grain and lumber, 7. These rates will take effect December 15. MISHAP TO A WHALEBACE.
