There was no difference upon this point. The next question, and this was unanimously suggested, was the introduction of a bill in the Gen eral Assembly for a road law with special reference to Obion County, embracing the points brought out at this maeting. Senator-elect Dr F. M. McKee, presiding1 at this meeting, and Representative-elect Keqney being present, it was sug- bridges by the ton and having them put up by home mechanics. A con siderable amount of graft is im posed upon counties making con tracts for the construction of steel bridges by the manufacturers.

These parts can be bought by the ton, and any man can tell what Ihe prrce- are by ex amining the prices of steel products. Every speaker present dwtlt upon Roads Convention Develops Much Interest.

This 6tove complete, with vessels, stove-pipe and handsome stove board, will be given away at 4 o'clock Dec. 2. Beginning Fri day, Nov. 30, each cash purchase of $1.00 will entitle the purchaser to a numbered ticket, which gives the holder a share in this contest. Mr. Walter Howell, cashier of the First National Bank, has selected from the numbered tickets one number, known only to himself, and placed it in the vaults of the First Na tional Bank. The holder of this lucky number will get the 6tove, complete; or if the ticket bearing this number is not presented, the one nearest to the number selected by Mr. Howell will be awarded this handsome and useful children's Xmas present.

Farmers who have been feeding their porkers long after they have attained the desired degree of Has Never Been Better Than Now. That the credit of the state of Tennessee is better to day than it has ever been before and is con stantly improving is abundantly evidenced bv the increase in the price of the State's interest-bearing obligations. Two years ago bonds in any sum could be readily purchased at 95, but this is no longer the case. Recently the Funding Board authorized the pur chuse of $000,000 of bonds for payment from the treasury surplus in January. This fact was exten sively published, but so far there have been very few bonds offered the State at 90-i and accrued inter est and the indications now are that the bonds will cost at least 96$ and it is not improbable that they will be 97 before the alotted amount is obtained. The condition'of the State's fi nances and its high credit in the fi nancial centers of the country should be a source of much grati fication to its citizens. The fol lowing letter from one of the lead ing banking firms of the United States is a high tribute both to the credit of the State and to the very I efficient manner in which the finan cial affairs have been administered: "New York, I)ec.3, 1906 Iteau E.

MESSAGE Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 7. Com menting on President Roosevelt's message, m. J. Airy an says that there is much that is good and much that is bad in it. But it may be regarded as the President's most important state paper. Mr. Bryan says: "The messege contains much that is Democratic and for which the general public may well thank him.- It contains some things that ought to arouse severe criticism, boldly appropriates some of the doctrines which the Democrats have been advocating, and, on the other hand, be announces some doctrines that are so absurd as to excite amusement if the sugges tions came from a less prominent source. In some cases he takes advanced ground; in some cases he retreats from ground already tak en." Mr. Bryan complains that what the President says on the subject erf government by injunction will not be satisfactory to the laboring men or to those who respect the right of trial by jury. The Presi dent's stand on child labor is com mended, as is also he position he takes on the eight hour law and the right of people to criticize a judge. Referring to Mr. Roosevelt's reference to the Japanese question Mr. Bryan says: "He pays a deserved tribute to the progress of the Japanese na tion and asks legislation which will enable Congress to protect the treaty rights of foreigners. That there should be such legisla tion cannot be generally disputed, but a great deal depends upon the character of the legislation. If any bills are presented in regard to this suggestion they must be carefully scrutinized to be sure that they do not deny to the va rious States the right to protect themselves and their people in matters purely local." Finally, Mr. Bryan deplores what he calls the President's war like attitude. He says in this con nection: "There will be general disap pointment at the warlike tone of his message where he discusses the army and navy. He speaks of the f navy as the surest guarantor peace which this country possess es. Shame upon the Chief Execu tive that he should place an instrti ment of brute force above the na tion's sense of justice as a guaran tor of peace. The best guarantor of peace is our nation's principle to deal justly with other nations, War ought to be a last resort, not a first consideration. It is bad enough to have a few professional soldiers. It is not necessary that the whole nation shall be keyed up all the time to the fighting point." What's worth doing is worth doion well.
