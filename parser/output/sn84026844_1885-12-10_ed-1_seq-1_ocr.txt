A Washing ton liiupatcli rei'iiea mo iuuuwiuk; although tho Democratic caucus at Richmond lias nominated Daniel as 8enator, to succeed General Mahone.the Bourbons here are disturbed by rumors they have received to the effect that the Barbour men feel so sorely they talk of bolting the nomination, and ahould thirty oithem hold out against Daniel it would be possible to elect an independent candidate, that is, if the bolters would combine with the Republicans. i Cait. Hulk's resignation as a member of the Hoard of Gas Trustees, affords an opportunity to do what should have been done in ttie first place, place a Republican upon the Hoard. This Republican should be, as everybody not governed by selfish 1 motives will admit, Dr. T. H. Logan. Dr. 1 Ljgan would represent not so much the ' Kepublican party as the business interests of the city, liis name stands not for mi- j nority representation on the Board, but for experience, capacity and faithfulness ' to the trust. Of these Capt. Rolf lacked 1 only experience; nobody questioned his fl nets for the position. He was accept- 1 a'-ile to both parties, but since he sees lit to resign peremptorily, the only, prop< r thing to do is to appoint Dr. Logan to tLe vacancy. Is the argument before the Supreme ! Court of Ohio, the counsel for the Republican Senatorial candidates in the Hamilton county frauds pertinently puts the questions at issue asfollows: "Since that ?1st day of October, 1885, until this hour, every public and private inUreat has been 1 set aside or subordinated to the trial of these cases, and we are here to-day to j ontinue the work of solemnly arguing, at a disputed question of law, whether fraud, forgery and crime, the will of this g&ug of robbers, la to have legal and judicial sanction, is to be counted as the legal returns of this election, or whether the will of the people is to be rcspected; whether conceded fraud, forgery and crime are to bo legalized as the will of the pso\)\o by the fiat of this Court, or whether 1 the will of the people, not only in this election, but for all time to come, is to triumph.''

In fact, what follows is a very different thing. The extract from tha Treasurer's , report dealt with the circulation. The I hole in the President's message, if it had not been j\ hole, would have dealt with tho interesting subject of our trade with < foreign countries. The two subjects are as wide apart as the full and accurate treatment of the message of thelumuOKM-sa and its savage emasculation by tha fogitter. Is it for this that we have waited ?oh, so impatiently?for a quarter of a century for the coming of a Democratic ; President? Perhaps the President may have escaped this treatment if he had j made some other disposition of the postoffice. Horn the London and the New York tnamma lelt yesterday tne shock 01 vanderbilt's death, but the shock was not of long continuance and nothing like a panic was developed. Had ho fallen dead early on Tuesday, instead of the middle of tha afternoon, the shock, coming suddenly* would have been mueh greater, and a serious slaughter of prices in the stock market would undoubtedly have followed. As it was, there was time for reflection, and, what was more important, time for the so-called Vanderbllt houses in Wall street to arrange for the support of their specialities. With this advantage In their favor they were able to turn the tide of prices upward immediately after the first onslaught on the market, and consequently quotations at the close were higher than at the opening. 1 There was really no reason why a panicky feeling should have followed the death of this modern Crojsus, inasmuch *1 his large holdings of securities were not to come on the market as if be were insolvent, but wero safely lodged with his own, as were tfcose oi ins ricn predecessor, but an occurrence of this sort is always the opportunity of the ,#bear" element in Wall street, and it was their name to create a fight and induce timid people to sacrifice their property. In this game they aeem to have been fortunately defeated. There is but one man whose death, even with an intervening night for reflection, would thoroughly convulse Wall street, and his name is Jay Gould. Not even the sudden death of the President of the United States would create anything like the;.same/%shock in Wall street. He is vastly more of a factor in the loan and security market than ever was Vanderbilt, even with the greater wealth of the latter, and his death would mean a great deal more to every interest represented in Wall street, especially to holders of shares in those properties which ho so exclusively controls.

It is ascertained, however, that under rule Bix all nominations not acted upon when the Senate adjourned in the Spring are dead and new nominations must be made. It is expected the President will announce his policy in reference to these appointments in a few days. Mr. Cleveland stated this evening to callers that he intends in the future to Bend in his nominations in batches of twenty-five, and it is expected McGraw's name will be among the last. A distinguished Republican who stands tigh in the councils of his party was on the floor of the Senate to-day, and stated to some of bis frienda this evening that he is satisfied "there will be no concert of action on the Republican side in opposition to the President's appointments."

Washington, D. Q^Jiec. 9.?'The President's message is variously received imong Democrats. The free traders are simply disgusted with it, and declare that the President has consulted Sam Randall on much in getting up his tariff views, rhey declare also that his views on the subject will not receive much consideration from them. It was noticeable that when the message was being read Randall and his friends were smiling and happy, upparently congratulating each other, while Morrison and Mills, both of whom l>n?? t%?nno?in? elonro favnrina <aMfl reduction, coufd not conceal the contempt they fait. Many consultations were held in the Democratic cloak rooms over the matter. The Republicans, of course, greatly enjoyed looking over to the Democratic side and seeing the discomfiture of their opponents. It was not expected that what the President had to say on the subject of silver coinage could pleaso many of the Democrats, and their leaders openly asBerted that nothing would be done iu the way of silver legislation the present session. The maddest lot, however, are the oflice-Reekere about the hotels who do not like the drubbing they received at the hands of the President. Ills allusion to "whining cleiks" was language hardly dignified enough for a President's inesaage, and be will gain no yespujt, therefore, from tho large army of Government employ* n.

ATTORNEY GENKHAL'8 REPORT. The I)naln*M of tha Supram* Court?Advo. ntu Couvlct Labor* Wabhisotok, D. C? Deo. 9.?The annual report to Congress of Attorney General Garland gives a detailed and succinct statement of the operations o( that department throughout the country during the past year, including the business of the Supreme Court, Court of Claims and Court of Commissioners of the Alabama claim*. During the year 1,058 civil suit* and It,977 criminal prosecution* vera terminated in various United States Court*, leaving 2,14(1 of the former class and 2,808 of the latter doss pending at the close of the year. The aggregate of the amount of judgment* rendered in favor of the United State* in civil suit* during the year wa* $077,383, and theamount that was collected on these Judgment* wa* $170,467, while $37,020 wa* obtained daring the year on judgment* in former years for the United bitates and $143,452 wa* otherwise realised in civil suits. The aggregate amount of fine*, forfeitures and penalties imposed during the year in criminal prosecutions wss $481,850, and the amount of these fines, forfeitures and penaltlea collected daring the year was $02,123, while $6,107 wa? retlijed oo fin**, forfeitures and penalties imposed in former years. The aggregate amount of court expenses paid during the year was $2,874,733. The Attorney General suggests the advisability of building jails at each place in the country where the United States Courts are held. The necessity of building a Government penitentiary where all persons are convicted of United States offenses could be confined is strongly urged. Such convicts, he said, could be employed on the manufacture of supplies, exclusively for the government, which work would assist in making the institutions self sustaining. A Bill to b* Introducer! Looking to Its Ke lalon?How the Tax la Evaded. Washington, Dec. i>.?Representative Caswell, of Wisconsin, intends to introduce a bill as soon as the same is in order for the purpose of correcting the tariff on tobacco. The revised tariff of 1883 provides that "leaf tobacco, of which 85 percent is of the requisite size and of the necessary fineness of texture to be suitable for wrappers, and of which more than one hundred leaves are required to weigh a pound, if not stemmed, [shall pay a duty of] 76 cents per pound." The most of this leaf tobacco at which the tariff is aimed comas from the Island of Sumatra. The importers of the.article have systematically evaded the law by seeing to it that the leaves "of tho requisite size and of the necessary fineness to bo suitable for wrappers" have not amounted to 85 porcent, and that loss than one hundred leaves shall weigh a pound. When the importations fail to come up to the standard given above, the tariff is only thirtytivo cents per pound. It is easily seen that there is an inducement to the ovasion of the law by the great difference in the duty imposed, while at the same time the importations are almost the same. As said above, most of this kind of to- 1 bJcco, coming into this country from I abroad, is irom aumaira. dir. uaaweu hopes to have the law amended so that it will specifically guard against Sumatra | tobacco by either directly naming it in the law or by correcting the grading of the importations as to prevent the wide i differences that now exist. It would be a violation of the law to specifically namo 1 Sumatra tobacco in the act, were there any I treaty between this country and the gov- 1 eminent controlling the island, but , investigation shows that no such treaty exists, and there is no ' hindrance to an amendmont to the law so as to specifically tax the importation of Sumatra tobacco. To show now the law is being evaded, it {it* only necestary to atate that the importatons for the ' last fiscal year were 23,000 pounds in this 1 Sumatra which paid a duty of 72 cents a { pound, and 2,300,000 pounds of the article which paid a duty of 30 cent* a pound, and yet the latter importations were scarcely 1 of less real value per pound then thoso < which paid the higher duty. It is against j the plain loophole for evading the tariff ' that the tobacco growers of the country 1 want relief. ' I Labor CangrciN. I Washington, D.

MORE EXPLOSIONS OF TBEACQXROU8 NATURAL GAS. The Great Philadelphia Llue SufTert a great Inconvenience?An Upheaval at Can* nonabnrg Completely DUtroya a Private llealdenoo. Pittsiubqh, Pa., Dec. tf.?About half past ten o'clock this morning a dispatch was received at the ollice of the Philadel* phift Gas Company which states that there had been an explosion of gas at the valve house of the company at Sandy Creek. The valve house was burned down, and a largo force of men had been at work till nearly noon putting out the tiro. Inquiry at the office was made, when it was learned that a force of workmen had been making some new valve connections at Rnnrlv flrA#>W. J nut. Imw thn Ainlnninn occurred no one could tell. None of the workmen were hurt, but the valres were totally destroyed, and all thn supply from the lines there was cut oil*. Ihe main line of pipe from Muiraysville comesJa Sandy Creek. The valve connections are made there. One pipe crosses the Allegheny river and comes down along the West Penn and the other comes down the Allegheny Valley. The force of men at work at the station were kept busy covering up the fire with dirt, as it was the only way that the dames c juld4be subdued. The valves are < thought to be rendered perfectly useless, but that cannot be determined till they aro uncovered. lu consequence of the leak and explosion, both pipes to the city are useless to-day. Tho Lawrencevillc mills and glass houses were shut down shortly before eleven o'clock, when tho 1 t^as went entirely out. An olKcial of tfee L-ompany suited that the connections would be made by evening on one of the pipe lines to the city, and by to-morrow morning the other would be got into working order. From a pressure of 70 pounds at Handy Creek it fell to 2J pouuds here after the break. The supply will bu short only at the mills along the Allegheny river. The break is an expensive 1 one for the company. j "It is well that it happened in weather , Like it is to-day," said one of the oilicials , of the company. A riiokt luppi'y. Users of large quantities of gas in the jlty were notified by the Philadelphia Porapany this afternoon that the supply ivae likely to be cut oif at auy time, and that they might prepare for it. At the Hotel Anderson they made arrangements to use coal whenever it would be necessary. Mr. Gillespie, of the Philadelphia Company, went up on tho noon train to Sandy Creek. Valves for the necessary repairs were sent up, and the line will be gotten into Bhape as soon as possible. The explosiou at Handy Creek caused tome little trouble iu Allegheny, which is supplied from the Philadelphia Co.'s mains. Early in the morning the pressure was twelve pounds, but it suddenly ceased, ind the supply from one main was cut off entirely, when the cause of tho trouble was learned. No serious inconvenience was occasioned, as the Allegheny company last night joined up their mains with that of the Chambers Company at Lindsay & McCutcheon's mill, and when the uipply from the Westinghouse Company fau short, the g&s from the Chambers Company was turned on, and there was abundance for the entire city. .

Esq., the family making an ; almost miraculous escape. About 4 o'clock, when the family were Bound asleep in their beds, the house was suddenly shaken as by an earthquake. The roof was literally blown off of it and hurled into an adjacent opfin lot, while the walls of the house bulged in were tottering, ready to fall at almost any moment. Mr. Greer knew iiothingof what had happened until he suddenly found himself in the street surrouuded by debris from the house. Around, lying on the ground, were hit wife, mother and three children. So suddenly had they been aroused from their slumbers that, they could not tell how they got upon the street, and their only explanation is that tfyey were blown clear < out of the rooliess building and alighted upon the Btreet. Mr. Greer escaped with a sprained back. His mother was severely burned about the face and hands, and his wife waa also slightly burned. His i children escaped with a few alight burns 1 and bruises. All were in their night ; clothes, but the crowd that had quickly 1 gathered soon provided them with shelter. : After the explosion the houBe took tire and ; in n varv ithnrt time wail comDletelv burn ed to the ground.

The defendant was one of the policy holders in the American Insurance Company of Chicago, which, the 1st of January, 1884, sold Its business to the Home Insurance Company of New York, the terms being tbe payment of $118,000 and tbo acceptance of premium notes given by the policy holdew in the first named-company. There were about 400 policy holders in Indiana, and in behalf of the defendant representing many of these, it was contenued that the American Company was insolvent and had gone out of business, and that, therefore, the policy holders were not bound to I continue paying their premiums, but were free to insure where they pleased. The verdict decided that the premium notes were still valid, and maintained the rights of the Home on all points. THE

Depew Dmorlbea Vanderbilt'* ^ Charactcrlatloa. 61 Nkw York, Dec. 9.?Chauncey M. De- 01 pew, president of the New York Central F railroad, has had more intimate relation w with Mr. Vanderbilt than any other per- a] non in the world. He has been his adviser J for twenty years. Mr. Depew talked 0I freely to a correspondent at his home, in ti East Forty-fifth street, this evening, and iaid: "I don't think that Mr. Vanderbilt ^ bad any idea that he was about to die. He al told an intimate friend of his about two ki weeks ago that he thought that if he passed his <>5th birthday he would be good for twenty years more of life. There was jome thing about the age of 65. which he leemed to consider a critical period? ai something connected with the family his- w tory, I believe. Mr. Vanderbilt was always a hard worker, and his large frame cr and immensely vigorous physique were the results of the work he did on his farm b( )nStaten Island. "He used to get up at 4 o'clock every iay, and he has told me that he had often come into the city and been back on the farm ploughing by 7 o'clock. When he went to the New York Central at the age if 43, he knew nothing about railroads fei and had to work very hard. He still kept ]ft ip his early rising, was always at work at ), and worked all day long and almost ? always until late in the evening. He was tho simplest of eaters at the table, and Cf never drank anything, except an occasional c0 glass cf claret. Nor did he ever use p tobacco in any form. He was extremely . * oiid of a good horse, and was one of the it jest drivers that ever lived. He became, be >y study and attention, one of the best judges ot pictures in thia country, as is :estilled by his gallery, which undoubtedly :ontains the best collection of modern all Daintinua in tho world. fh fKARLKSS OH 

ASSASSINATION. m "Another of his peculiarities was bis he fearlessness. He was constantly in re- Ti :eij>t of letters, informing him at what to liour and place ho would bo shot or stabbed or otherwise killed, but they never in- aR timidated him. His habits were rogular w und he drove out daily at a certain hour K along the same roads and by the same p{ places, went to his olllce at the same hour "f\ and entered and left in the same way. ol The letters he received never stopped him ttr from these journeys. He always handed Iheso lettera to me, but he would never ^ permit me to investigate them. w: Mr. Vanderbilt was a great family man, ^ was fond of his children and of having pg family gatherings at his home. He never ft cared for large parties or dinners. He liked to have a few friends drop in and ps talk with him or play iwhiat or euchre. His reading was conlined entirely to the m daily press und to the events of ttie pres- tu ent. He was a philosopher on the subject of misrepresentation in the pub- <Ji lie prints, his iuea of his relation to the reBtof the world was to act according to ^ his own standard, which he believed good _ or as near right as he knew how. He recognizad the fact that his wealth and the character of his investments neoesaa- jj rily subjected *bi*u to criticism and dis i;ipniuw, ^uuocijucuwjr no ucuauiu ucuua* jy torned to abuse, and, while not affected 0f by it, he waa always pleased when nice p, things were printed about him." "l'he changes have been rang ? thoaBand times," continued Mr. Depew, "up-. ^ on that 'public be d?d' expression. The fact is that hp payor said it in the sense q attributed to him and it hurt him very ? much. He was not a coarse, loud or vul- ? gar man, and all reports to that elTect are uutrue. He was a gentleman, and always ^ dressed and behaved as such." jr He neyer gave in Uis wannw of treatmentany indication that he knew the dif- qi ference between a man worth five cents jfr and one wortk five millions. In talk he jj was a (air man, but exceedingly frank and p. blunt. With all his wealth he had not pride of opinion, bqt intinitely preferred to discuss questions of moment before acting. He was a capital judge of men, and rarely made a mistake in them. He 01 inherited his father's manner of jumping e? at shrewd conclusions, though not by lop- bo ical processes or regular Methods. His iQ frequent remark would be, "Now what 1 want is not what you think I want you to m think, but what you think yourself/' He ly Ww|l sUatinghandiiimd saying, fr: "How tte you, old follow," which made him very pleasant. _ "I do not think," conclnded Mr. Dopew, "there is any earthly reason why hia de?th ahqnld cause any disturbance in e the fluamilol world.

The report was untrue, and hac was not even probable that Lord Salis- ma iry would take such action as yet, for wil e following reasons: He had persuaded himself tbat an liance with Parnell would estrange from e Troy party all the Orangemen and a i any moderate British supporters. Thus ) would still be left without a majority. ( lerefore he believed that a better pay- the g game is to put no obstaclo in the way tell the pending intrigue between the reE adicals and Parnellites; to even encour- wa ;o that coalition to carry a motion of sea ant of conlidence in his government, Fri id then to expoae the intrigues and ap- hei ial to tbe country on an anti-Irish cry. to i tiis programme involves tbe retention of res lice by the Tories, at least until Febru- pai y 5th. sue .During all the shifting and hedging, stn o combinations and intrigues which del ill orowd the interval, they will control ate: e Treasury purse strings and the vast Th itronage of the British Government, ulo [lis fact should not be overlooked in es- wa mating the probable strength of the for irties two motnhs hence. tio: Auother element of the sitnation which awi a7 have a potent influence is the atti- ere de of the Queen. It is known that her ligl ajesty is disgusted with the present con- snc tion of affaire, and it is certain that she cot 111 afford every facility in her power for bis rrying oat the above outlined pro- all; amine if it is decided on by Lord Sails- sea irr. wa Mr. Parnell la still coquetting with the wa berals. All the parties are plaving a the >ep game to discredit their rivals. Mean- ach bile the Liberals are carrying every one mil the remaining British seats, and will wh obably outnumber the Tories and Par- aid jllites combined. This fact makes them ins iffer in their demands for the price of hel eir favors. A member of Mr. Gladone's late Government informed the * ible News correspondent that the pro- < arnnie recently sketched by Mr. Hugh ior , Ohilders. late Chancellor of the Ex- .

It was on Sat urday evening tliat tlio announcoinent was made that an election Mould bo held on Saturday, January i?, and four candidates were named to be voted for. The eoinmitteH uh appointed Jaat year conaiated of A.N. Williams, J. B. I)orley, L. B. Dellicker, 0. C. Martin and F. Jenkins. W. J. Hill was appointed but would not havo it, and John B. Doraey (V'4h appointed au hia substitute. The election notice waa signed by only 0. 0. Martin awl F. Jenkins, of the committee, md Col. W. J. Hill. It appears that Mr. Dellikor, who ia chairman of the commitee, and Mr. Doraey, know nothing of the :oaferenco with Senator C'amdon or had he slighteat inkling of the echomo until hey read the notice for the election, pur>orting to come from their committee, iu lie State Joumnl of Saturday. Tho candi-. latea named in this notice were, Urat, Llf. N. Williams, who ia understood to >e Camden's favorite for tho poatoilice, ud to whom he would give the plum rare it not that ho fears that such a proeeding would call down on him the ureea of generationa yet unborn, and it rill alao be observed that Williams is a aeinber of the committee; ho waa also reently defeated, aftcrapending about $1,500 rying to ha Sheriff of Wood county.

It ia reported that tho manner in which be heathen raged and uttered vain things II day 8unday and Mondny was awful, 'his tumult coming as it did after a paitiil silence of nine months, during which ime each candidate secretly imagined that e had the oflice "dead sure, 'made tho acket all the more noticeable. There rere groans, hisses and curses in Demoratic circles, and candidates who had eon ignored by this wonderful, self-con* Litnted committee ciacked their heels as tiey pranced aud declared that tho rising f tho nun on January U would find bein and their friends at the polling laces and there they would remain until 10 going down of tho same. The scenes i the forum (Court House square) are aaid ) have been wildly picturesque. As time ew on new candidates sprang up like the reeds of the night, until Monday noon mnd the following naraod in line: Mrs. Walters. Sands, Mrs. Mary L. Murphy, lies Lettie Stinchcombe, A. N.

In the meantime it was given out that [orner and Gambrill would novor consent ) the election scheme. Horner' runs a ewspaperthat has on numerous occas>ns proved itself capable of becoming a ery sharp and largo sized thorn, and aerefore it was nectssary that something mat h? dono to und<j what had already een done. Then also, the members of tho commit* je who had not been consulted were makig something of a disturbauce. The relit was, that late ou Monday evening a lanifesto was issued, this time from the ruo iuuuimu uenu, ij illuming wm?reB68 and resolves of Saturday. This was jllowed by another riot and all was not >velv. Major L. N. Logan waa a andidate not recognized in the imous order of Saturday. As soon as e saw that ho notified Seuaior Camden liat he was in the field; that ho came -om a family of braves that had stayed rith the senior Senator in all his politial rackets nnd now to be cruelly deserted ras more than he or his friends would land; they would make it deuced hot for ame one at the polls.
