The news from New York yesterday that all hope of saving the Hecla mine has been abandoned, and that the property cannot be placed in working order again under two or three years is an admission that the supply of Lako copper will be reduced to one-third the recent output for that length of time. There is every reason to believe that copper will continue to ascend until the figures attain the highest value yet re corded for the metal. The mines of Butte will have all they :an do to meet the re quirements now thrown upon them. The bill to limit immigration introduced in the Senate on Monday lacks only one additional provision to make it the most sensible piece of legislation projected in a long while. In addition to the require ments specified in the passport from an American consul which each immigrant must obtain that he is not a convict, pau per, idiot or insane person, and can sup port himself out of the means he brings with him for six months after landing here, it should also be certified to that he is not an Anarchist or Socialist, but has a sincere respect and admiration for the Constitu tion and institutions of the United States, and is perfectly satisfied to be allowed the privilege of living under the wise and lib eral system of Government therein pro vided for. The Republicans have thrown down the gage of battle to the President's message in the bill introduced by Senator Farwell on Monday to repeal the internal revenue tax on tobacco in all forms. They accept Mr. Blaine's assurance that it is not a luxury, but one of the necessaries to tLe sustenance of human life. The tax at present is 8 cents a pound on smoking and chewing to bacco and $3 a hundred on domestic cigars. If any man who smokes a pipe or cigar honestly believes that he will get his tobacco for less than he now pays with the internal revenue tax removed he is too gullible an individual to beallowed to wan der far from home without a guardian. The men who manufacture the tobacco in to forms for general use are the individuals who would reap the major part of the prof it and the retail dealer would get what was left. The tax on this luxury, which every one except Mr. Blaine regards it, is one of the most easily borne in the whole list of taxes, and the argument that it should be removed because it was put on during the war is as specious a piece of claptrap bun combe as was ever used. 

PEACE TO HIS ASHES, A brilliant light of Montana journalism was extinguished yesterday in the death of J. E. Hendry, the Helena Inde pendent's bright and versatile managing editor. Our special from there gives full particulars of the sad event. He was a young man with a brilliant destiny before him. In his all too short career he had made his mark as a lucid, graceful writer, a thinker, and a courteous gentleman incap able of treating an antagonist with the smallest approach to unfairness. His loss will not soon be re placed.'^! The growing Northwest can illy spare a man the beginning of whose career gave promise of so much that is needful in shaping thought and directing energy, and whose elevation of ideas helped to raise the standard of journalism in the Territory. Calm, temperate and self-pos Bessed, abreast of the times in all that is best in modern thought, modest and unassuming, quietly humorous, gifted with keen common sense which he clothed in ex cellent English, the paper he so ably served and the friends who knew him but to ad mire him sustain in his death a severe blow. WANTED—A BIG HOTEL. The Omaha papers ascribe their defeat in securing the Republican National Conven tion to tlieir lack of hotel facilities. They are doubtless correct. In the important point of railway communication, Omaha is sufficiently supplied with a network of roads in every direction to briDg the crowds attending a national convention to her with ease. Chicago with her enormous first-class hotel accommodation can hau die the biggest crowds of any city west of New York. The hotel accommodations of the city have always kept pace with its growth, and the traveller can visit it with the certainty of finding ample hotel ae commodation at all times and of all de scriptions. At the present time Helena comes nearest of any town in Montana to meeting the requirements of the age in the way of hotels. Though in no way supplied with such natural res <r r-s as Butte, Hel ena has three excell, n* L is, all of which are successfully con mud. Butte, which will, for the next two or three years cer tainly, be the spot in the world upon which all eyes will be turned as the main souree of copper supply, to which every one will look as theplaeof eupremest importance in the copper market, has not a hotel that for size or appearance is fit to be mentioned in the same breath with thoBe of Helena. They suited the requirements of Butte when it was first .incorporated, but the village has grown to a city and what was good enough for th«se days is scarcely up to the requirements of the present time. There are two or three projects on foot for the erection of a hotel to cost in the neigh borhood of a couple of hundred thousand dollars next spring. These rumors have been heard here before and they have come to nothing. But at the present time conditions exist in Butte which make it imperative that the erection of a first-class hotel of good size, and conducted in a style commensurate with its pretensions, should be actively undertaken early in the spring. No one of sense or intelli gence denies that Butte will enter then upon the most prosperous era of its existence. Forces are at work that are inevitably bound to give this town the greatest boom it has yet experienced. The days of supine inertness and waiting for the trade that is bound to come to you have passed. Railroads are coming in here which will make Butte a center to which travel will be attracted as flies are by a sugar barrel. Men will come here to secure the trade of its merchants, to see the won ders of the greatest copper camp on earth, to invest their money in the rich field that awaits the prospector. Butte's richness as a mining camp is only beginning to be known in the centers of speculation of the land, and capitalists will make this their Mecca. They must be lodged suitably. They cannot be now. Our hotel accomwo* dation now is limited and inadequate the present, let alone the coming need« of town. Of the projects spoken of at present for the erection of a large hotel, there three different locations mentioned. In existingcondition of the projected undertak ings, it would be premature to mention Bites selected. There can be no question however, that a hotel which is to most fectually subserve the interests of town must be located on or neai Main street. The presence of the street care cilitatee access to the upper portion of city as easily as the lower, it is true, yet etrangers the labor of climbing to the up per part of the town is something they not take to with avidity. For this reason a site in the lower central portion of the city would be most advisable. The pro jects now being discussed may be expected to assume definite shape in the near fu tare, and should Butte next spring see un der way more than one hotel enterprise, will simply be taken ae evidence that the cap' italists of this city are alive to the coming rush of travel which will inevitably set next year. THE 

INTER MOUNTAIN CHESTNUT. Our evening contemporary entirely nores the bad break it made on Monday comparing the source of supply of the Butte water worke with that of Ottawa, Canada, which ie, as yesterday explained in The Mines, the River Ottawa into which a creek, impregnated with the filth of a slaughter house, empties immediately above where the water is pumped iato the mains of the city. The Inter Mountain said "these conditions, it appears, are very similar to those in Butte," only that the sources of the Butte water supply were worse contaminated. No one reading the Inter Mountain's article in its Monday sue would infer anything else than that the water supply of Butte ie taken from a fouled river similar to the Ottawa river, and whether that "conscientious journal intended to mislead its readers to the tent stated or not, no other inference was possible. There is not a line in the article that fairly states the actual facts as gards the source of supply of the new waterworks. It was simply a misleading untruth and as such The Mi.nek character ized it. This paper was justified in doing so by the facts, and when it called a spade a spade, the public could Bee that in doing so it indulged in no "frightful exhibitions of irascibility'' or "nervous excitement as the Inter Mountain is pleased to term this paper's strictures upon such a palpa ble departure from the truth. This paper, in its conception of duty as a "conscientious journal," is actuated solely by the welfare of the community, It does not believe that it renders a service to the community by imagining a condi tion of affairs that can only have the effect of creating unfounded alarm and injuring the fair name of the city. It knows that nothing can hurt a town more than declar ing the water in use in it full of impurities such as will produce an epidemic of typhoid fever. The conditions existing at Ottawa, Canada, are such without question. The conditions in Butte are not, aud The Miner condemns the attempt of the Inter Moun tain to lead people to believe that there the slightest similarity in the two cases willfully and knowingly untrue, and it be lieves it comes nearer performing the duties expected of a "conscientious journal" contending for the truth than in the mere tricious publication of a sensation that has no foundation in truth. The public will think so, too, and prefer truth at the expense of a sensation which is so utterly untrue, being purely imaginary, as well as doing the community incalculable injury. In the local columns of this paper will be found a full aDd accurate description the sources of supply of the water that drunk by the citizenB of Butte. By this the Inter Mountain can become better in formed as to where the 90,000 gallons comes from that "flows into the well each day," etc. By this it can learn that the "leading mining men" to whom it refers were simply misled by the health commit tee in the statements of the latter which they took on trust and did not derive from personal observation in assisting them in their investigations as the Inter Mountain states. The "leading mining men" are said to have personally inspected the portion of the valley north of Grove Gulch and "accepted as true the state merits" of the Council Committee relative to the source of supply of the new water works. They never inspected the pump house, or the wells from which the water supply is drawn and the inspection of the committee must have been a curiously faulty one when they could speak of the hermetically closed box in winch the water is conducted from an iron pipe and a carefully enclosed well as a "trench." By referring to the local page of this paper the Inter Mountain can Bee what amount of "traction" the pumps of the waterworks exert in dra ining up that subterranean supply. All the "traetion' exerted is simply to take into the pumps water that, when they are idle, flows off into Silver Bow creek, three feet lower than the surface of the well, in a volume equal to fifteen inches miners' measurement. It will see that the water in tbe.wells from which the p urnps draw their supply is an under ground spring that forces its way to the surface whenever given vent, and that it no more possible for seepage from the marsh it gloats over to affect it than if it was on the other side of the divide, and that its ghoulish reference to the slaughter house aDd its filthy corral is superfluous and purely sensational. As to the Inter Mountain's assertion that Professor Chand ler's analysis was insufficient to detect typhoid poison in water, we have that analyst's statement, after making the analysis, that "the water does not show any evidence whatever of contamination. Seeing, then, that a man of science pro nounces this water perfectly free from the least impurity now, and that there ie no possibility of any of the contamination that the Inter Mountain "rolls like a sweet morsel under its tongue" in its allusions penetrating to the sources of supply, The Miner declines to indulge in speculations about a supposititious state of facts that have not now, and never can have, any existence. The reprehensible scare that the Inter Mountain has endeavored to foster is based simply on the supposition of a non-existent condition of facte. Its hobby is the seepage theory. That theory is knocked higher than Beecher's "Life of Christ" by the simple statement of facts contained in the local columns of this paper to-day. That being so, all discussion of wliat would happen if se and so were the case is as profitable as an argument upon what would occur should an irresistible force encounter an immovable body. The Inter Mountain should drop the water sub ject. _ It is becoming a chestnut. People are tired of theorizing. The Inter Mountain should not withhold from the community the name of the water company in the interest of which it has pub lished so many malicious misstatements about the existing supply, with a view to scaring off consumers. Delegate Toole has bestirred himself to procure additional help lor the over worked Helena postoffice. Now let him turn his efforts in the direction of Butte. If he can even get one additional clerk for the postoffice here it will be an immense help. The petition of Montana for the repeal of bo much of the alien land law as affects mining was presented on Wednesday. Sen ator Mitchell has alr3ady introduced a bill having that object in view, and there is very little doubt that it will pass, to the great relief of one of the principal industries of the West. How much stock will the "conscientious journal" get in the new water company it hints "may be organized to meet the de mands of the public health?" To judge by the able-bodied manner in which it has thrown truth to the winds and plunged into a sea of reckless misstatement, its services deserve a good slice of the stock— At its present Yftlue.

HORSEWHIPPED BY GIRLS. An Editor Gets a Thrashing for Traduc ing High-School Pupils. Hammond, Ind., Dec. 13.— S. B. Towle, editor of the Echo, published here, wae horse-whipped as he left his office last night by three young school girls, whom he had slandered in yesterday's issue of his paper. The high school girls had petition ed for an additional stove in their study room, which petition the Echo character ized as brainless and silly, and the girls returned in kind in the columns of the Hammond Independent of Tuesday.. Yes terday the Echo devoted three quarters of a column to the most vindictive abuBe of the girls in question and intimated that they were of doubtful character. This eo enraged them that they armed themselves with CAYENNE PEPPER AND HORSEWHIPS, and three of them, Miss Birdie Hammond, Miss Julia Parlier and Mise Guthrie, took up positions in front of the Echo office. As the editor came down the sidewalk they threw pepper in bis face and then be labored his head and back with whips until he begged for mercy and ran up the street to escape. The young ladies follow ed bim about half a block and continued to lash him until he broke away across the block between the houses, falling into the ditch and losing his hat. Into the yard they still followed him, where be threatened to shoot them. He finally got away, but is badly used up. The young ladiesareabout 15 or 16 years old and are highly respected. DEMPSEY STILL CHAMPION. Reagan Defeated in Fort 7-Fire Bounds of Hard Fighting. The Bing Pitched Twice on Account of the advancing Tide. Terrible Punishment of the Vanquished Gamely Endured. Dempsey, Though Often Hit, Shows No Signs of It. The Fight Lasts One Hour and Nine Minutes. New York, December 18.— Jack Dempsey and Johnny Reagan met this morning up the Hudson and fought to a finish for the middleweight championship of America and $2,000 prize money under tho London prize ring rules. The ring was pitched near the shore, and the fight began about 8:30. Terrific fighting was done from the start, clinching and pounding being the order. In the secoud round Dempsey claimed Reagan wae fouling him by spiking, and the referee cautioned Reagan against it. In the third, however, Reagan accidentally spiked Dempsey in a terrible manner in the left leg. The cut wae eo deep the bone could be seen. There was much wrangling, Dempsey's um pire claiming the fight. The -eferee over looked it. however. In the fifth round the tide, which was on the flood, began to creep into the ring. Dempsey wae compelled to move partly out of hie corner. Still the men fought in a desperate manneruntil the eighth round| which wae fought in water three inches deep all over the ring. Demp sey's leg was now in a terrible condition, and as it pained him the more, lie seemed to fight the more desperately if possible than before, punishing Reagan quite se verely. There was no doubt by this time that Reagan wae NO MATCH FOB DEMPSEY in the matter of wrestling, as the latter had thrown his opponent with ease and vigor eaeh time they clinched. At the close of the eighth round the referee stopped the fight until another ring could he pitched 011 dry land. Time occupied during these eight rounds, eighteen minutes. All went to the boat and the principals went to bed. Wrangling between the parties con tinued loud and long. At 12:10 p. m. the fight was resumed in a much better place Dempsey went right at Reagan and a clinch ensued during which terrific in-fighting was done. It ended by Dempsey backheeling Reagan and going down with him heavdy. In the tenth Dempsey smashed Reagan on the ribs with his left and on the nose with his right with terrific force, drawing blood, which wae claimed but not allowed for Dempsey, as Reagan had got first blood in the second. REAGAN FOUGHT HARD and fast, and elicited much praise. In the eleventh and twelfth Dempsey pounded and threw Reagan again. It was evident the latter had the worst of the bargain in agreeing to the London rules. He went on, however, like a Spartan. On the thirteenth Dempsey attempted again to back-heel his opponent-, who went down on his knees to avoid a fall. Reagan was thrown hard in both the fourteenth and fifteenth, while the infighting was of the most savage charac ter. In the sixteenth and seventeenth were two more falls for Dempsey, who also gave Reagan a terrible smash on the nose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth the same thing was kept up, although Reagan fought gamely and did the best he could. In the twentieth Dempsey kept up a tattoo on Reagan's ribs until oozing blood made the body appear raw. When Reagan went down to avoid a fall Dempsey cursed him and told him to get up and fight. Reagan came up angry for the twenty-first, and the fighting was furious, Dempsey receiving some heavy blows. Rea gan received a terrible thump on the ribs. Tn the forty-first both men at the same in stant fetched each other various clips with the right and left. Dempsey had scarcely a mark on him at this time, besides a swol len left eye. Rounds forty-two, forty-three and forty-four practically ciosed the battle. Dempsey unmercifully punished Reagan, whose lips were puffed and his left eye closed. He Was voted by spectators as game a man as ever stood iu the ring. He never cried quits. At the beginning of round forty fifth, at the solicition of Reagan's friends who saw he had no chance, his second jumped in'o the ring and threw up the sponge. The fight lasted one hour nine minutes. In the first ring there was eighteen minutes' fighting, and in the sec ond forty-one minutes'. The fight ended at 1:01 p. m.,leaving Dempsey still cham pion middleweight. Both men weighed 147. Dempsey has won thirty fights and had six draws. He has never been defeated. Reagan only fought 1 wo battles previous to this, winning both. OUR SPECIAL SERVICE AFTER LIFE'S FITFUL FEVER. Death of J. E. Hendry, Editor of the Helena Independent, at 28 Years of Age. Helena, M.T.,December 13.—[Special to the Miner by the Rocky Mountain Tele graph.]—J. E. Hendry, managing editor of the Independent, died at noon to-day. Six weeks ago he contracted a cold, but no one thought it was serious. The day of the Manitoba celebration he was out for an hour or two, but was compelled to re turn to ht3 home. About two weeks ago typhoid fever set in which after several hopeful rallies culminated in his death. Kind friends and his business associates were untiring in their efforts to alleviate his sufferings, and nurse him back to his life of usefulness, but it could not be. Mr. Hendry was born in New Brunswick March 21,1859, and when a youth went to Minnesota, where he edited a weekly paper. Later he came to Montana and was con nected with the Billings Herald, was one of the founders of the Livingston Enterprise, and later edited the Butte Town Talk. In April, 1886, he became connected with the Helena Independent, and about a year ago assumed editorial charge. He was univer sally acknowledged to be the brightest writer on the Montana press, with a fund of information surprising in a man so young.

Cartersville, M. T.. December 13 [Special to the Miner by Rocky Mountain Telegraph.]—Sunday night, the 11th, a man named J. A. Burton, formerly a soldier at Fort Shaw, became involved in a quarrel with a man named Paluiatier, who is re garded as a vicious character. The parties clinched and Burton was handled rather roughly which enraged Burton, whereupon he struck Palmatier, who drew a knife and attempted to stab Burton. The blow was warded off and Burton received the cut in the arm. Palmatier then threw the knife at Burton and then ran out doors and, picking up a stone, threw it at Burton, who was hit over the left eye, cutting an ugly gash and probably fracturing the skull. From the appearance of the wound it is more likely it was done by the knife when warding of! the blow which cut his arm. The man ie unconscious and is not expected to live. _ Great Falls Happenings.

Said constitutional power is ample either to pass a general law lor all the States, < ne applicable to a number of States or a spe cial law in respect to any particular State.

Esmonde and O'Connor Given a Recep tion at Washington. A Distinguished Audience Assembled to Greet Them. Ingalls Recalls England's Equivocal Course During the Rebellion. Ireland Has Twice the Population of the Thirteen Colonies. O'Connor Speaks Eloquently of Ire* land's Centuries of Misrule. Washington, December 14. — Sir Thomas Henry Grattan Esmonde and Hon. Arthur O'Connor, leaders of the Irish Home Rule cause in the English Parliament, arrived in the city this afternoon and were tendered a reception at the Masonic Temple by the Irish societies of the city. 

SHERMAN'S SPEECH. When the distinguished guests arrived at the Temple they were escorted to seats on platforms where a large number of Sena tors and Representatm s were present to do them honor. Senator Sherman was chosen chairman. He was greeted with loud applause and in acknowledging the compliment said he believed he spoke the general voice of the people in every part of the union, when he said to the distinguished guests the sympathy of America went forth fully and heartily in a strong desire that they might have home rule in Ireland to the full extent demanded by Parnell and Glad stone. He wanted Ireland to possess the same rights ns those enjoyed by the people of the United States. Why was it the Brit ish Government denied to the gem of the British Empire what was conferred on all the colonies of this great empire? Irish men had led in advance in a I! the great battles which England had fought for two centuries. Irland had furnished the De niosthenes and Ciceros of modern times Ireland had produced great men in every branch of life. He hoped the pleading voice of Gladstone, the greateststatesman of the age, would induce the British Parliament to grant home rule. 

SENATOR INGALLS, after the applause with which he was greeted had subsided, said two illustrious Irish members of the British Parliament have crossed the ocean to tell the story of the wrongs of Ireland. They are here for the purpose of ascertaining the sentiments of the American people upon this great question, which is now occupying the at tention of men all over the civilized world We have assembled this evening for the purpose of saying that the cause of Ire land is the cause of America and the cause of humanity itself. If we are called upon to choose between expressing our sympathies for Great Britain or for Ireland in this contest, no American citizen wiil long lies! täte as to what his preference shall be, Great Britain should not forget that seven millions of people determined to be free can never be enslaved. Great Britain should not forget that three millions of people in the original thirteen colonies re volted and ACHIEVED INDEPENDENCE under far less provocation than seven mill ions of Irish people have endured for cen turies. He did not desire to intrude upon the comity of nations, but he could not for get that a brutal and degraded British soldiery within the memory of men who might be now within bearing of his voice had sacked this capital. Ho could not forget that- in every great, crisis of American his tory we have had to contend with the ill will and malevolence oî the governing classes of Great Britain. That she consorted with the South and equivocated with the North and continued everything short of actual hos tility to secure the downfall of the Auieri can Union. During that awful period there was not a battlefield for American liberty which was not illustrated by Irish valo and consecrated by Irish blood. He then introduced SIR ARTHUR O'CONNOR, who was received with cheers, said he was sensible of the greatness and sacredness of the cause which he had the honor to repre sent. Here in Washington, the headquar ters of freedom, t lie capital of the grandest and freest community the world had ever seen, no cause which was not just could call for such a distinguished audience Ireland was attempting by force ftf organ ized public opinion, by constitutional and peaceful means to secure the repeal, not of law, but of a conquest. It was at tempting to repeal the conquest of Ire land. Mr. O'Connor spoke eloquently of the wrongs endured by Ireland during 7U0 years of English rule since that couquest and proceeded to give a picture of the oppression and hardship to which the Irish people were compelled to bow. He detailed the demands whieh the Home Rule party made upon the English Gov ernment. They had come here to thank America for her past aid and to ask for its continuance until the crisis, now im pending, is passed. Senator Hawley, the next speaker, said the speech of Mr. O'Connor was a statement of a terrible fact,a terrible arraignment. Hu manity everywhere would say that he had stated wrongswhich must be remedied. He joined very gladly in the welcome to these distinguished representatives of the Liberal party of the Great British Empire. RESOLUTIONS were unanimously adopted extending hearty greeting to Messrs. Esmonde and O'Connor, protesting in the name of hu manity against the Tory policy toward Ireland, being subversive of liberty, of right, of justice; declaring that the people of Ireland may well arraign their oppres sors before the civilized world—in the words of Thomas Jefferson: "You have destroyed the lives of our people with cir cumstance of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, aud totally unworthy a civilized nation,"—ex pressing admiration for Parnell and the Irish Parliamentary party, thanking Glad stone for his course toward Ireland and pledgingli .ami.il aid to the Irish people. «500,000 DAMAGES.
