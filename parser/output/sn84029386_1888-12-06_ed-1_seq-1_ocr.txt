President Cleveland Addresses Congress on National Affairs He Reiterates His Views on the Tariff and Condemns &3 Short-Sighted the Policy of His Opponents. The Fisheries Treaty and the Sackville Incident Public Lands Department Matters Etc Washington, Dec. 3. Congress opened &t 1:30 to-day for its second session. The President's message was presented to both houses and read. ' President Cleveland opens his message to Congress by calling attention to the fact that with the expiration of the present session of Congress the first century of our constitutional history is completed. The time admonishes us to soberly inquire whether in the past we have always closely kept in the course of safety, and whether we have before us a way plain and clear which leads to happiness and perpetuity. When the experiment of our Government was nndertaken the chart adopted for our guidance was the Constitution. Departure from the lines there laid down is failure. It is only by a strict adherence to the direction they indicate, and bv restraint within the limitatlo s they flx, that we can furnish proof to the world of the fitness of the American people for self-government. The equal and exact justice of which we boast as the underlying principle of our insti tutions should not be confined to the relations of our citizens to each other. The Government itself is under bond to the American people that in the exercise of its functions and powers rtwill deal with the body of our citizens in a manner scrupulously honest and fair and abso lutely just. We view with pride and satisfac tion the bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny de velops a somber shading. Upon more careful inspection we find the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness. A crowded and constantly increasingurban pop ulation suggests the Impoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural pur suits. We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturerers are no longer solely the re ward of sturdy industry and enligbted foresight, but they result from the discrimi ating favor of the Government and are largely built upon un due exaction from the masses of our people. The gulf between employers and employed is constantly widening and classes aro rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and pow erful, while In the other are found the toiling poor. Corporations which should be the carefully re strained creatures of the law and the servants of the people are fast becoming the people's masters. StiU congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our country, and complacently contemplating every Incident of change Inseparable from the conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citi zens to inquire at the present stage of our pro gress how the bond of the Government made with the people has been kept and performed. Instead of limiting the tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities of its economical ad ministration, the Government persists in ex acting from the people millions which, unap plied and useless, lie dormant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation add to extortion the danger at tending the diversion of the currency of the country from the legitimate channels of busi ness. Under the same laws by which the results are produced the Government permits many millions more to be added to the cost of living of our people and to be taken from our con sumers, which unreasonably swell the profits of a smaU but powerful minority. The people must be taxed for the support or the Govern ment under the operation of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of our citizens are Inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose, and for the bene fit of a favored few, the Government under a pretext of an exercise of its taxing pow er, enters gratuitously into partnership with these favorites to their advantage and to the Injury of a vast majority of our people. This is not equality before the law. The existing situation is injurious to the health of our entire body politic It stifles, in those for whose ben efit it is permitted, all patriotic love of country and substitutes in its place selfish greed and grasping avarice. When to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under our laws there shall be added the discontent of those who suffer from such discrimination, we wiU realize the fact that the beneficent purpose of our Government, dependent upon the patriotism and contentment of our people, is endangered. Communism is a hateful thing, and a menace to peace and organized government. But the communism of combined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of overweaning cupidity and selfishness which insidiously undermines the justice and Integrity or free institutions, is not less dangerous than the communism of op pressed poverty and toil, whlcii. exasperated by injustice and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the ctadcl of rule. He mocks the people who proposes that the Government shall protect the rich and that they in turn will care for the laboring poor? Any intermediary between the people and their Government, or the least delegation of the care and protection the Government owes to the humblest citizen in the land, makes the boast of free institutions a glittering delusion and the pretended boon of American citizenship a shameless Imposition. A just and sensible revision of our tariff laws should be made for the relief of those or our countrymen who suffer under present condi tions. Such a revision should receive the sup port or aU who love that justice and equality due to American ciuzensnip; of nil who realize that in this justice and equality our Govern ment finds its strength and power tft protect the citizen and his property; of all who believe that the content ment, competence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our institutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered in the hands of a few; of all who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity among our people, which recognize the value of every Ameri an interest are the surest guaranty of our national progress, and of all who desire to see the pro ducts of American skill and ingenuity in every market of the world, with re sulting restoration of American commerce. Existing evils and injustices should be honestly recognized, boldly met and effectively reme died. There should bo no cessation of the struggle until a plan is perfected, fair and con servative towards existing industries, but which wHTrednce the cost to consumers of the neces saries of life, while it provides for our manu- r factnrersthe advantage of free raw materials and permits no injury to the interests of Ameri can labor. The cause for which the battle is Waged Is confined within lines clearly and dis tinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It Is the people's cause. It can not be denied that the selfish and pri vate Interests which are so persistently heard when efforts are made to deal In a just and comprehensive manner with our tariff laws, are related to, if they are not respons.ble for, the sentiment largely prevailing among the people that the General Government is the fountain of individual and private aid; that it may be expected to relieve with paternal care the distress of citizens and communi ties and that from the fullness of its' treasury it should, upon the slightest possible pretext of promoting the general good, apply pnblio funds to tho benefit ' "' of localities and individuals: nor can it be de ? t K xMA that there if growing assampUon that, fts 'against the Government and in favor of private of private claims and Interests, the esual rules and limitation of business principles and Just dealing should be waited. These ideas iave been unhappily much en cam-aged by legislative acquiescence. Belief Xromowtractt owfe with the Garferasn&tig easily accorded in favor of the citizen, as the failure to support claims against the Govern ment by proof Is often supplied by no better consideration than the wealth of the Govern ment and the poverty of the claimant Gratui ties in the form of pensions are granted upon no other real ground than the needy condition of the applicant, or for reasons less valid, and large sums are expended for public buildings and other improvements upon representations scarcely claimed to be related to public needs and necessities. Tlie extent to which the con sideration of such matters subordinate and postpone action upon subjects of great public importance but invovig no special, private or partisan interest should arrest attention and lead to reformation. A few of the numerous illustrations of this condition may be stated: The crowded conditlo-i of the calendar of the Supreme Court, and the delay to suitors and de nial of justice resulting therefrom, have been strongly urged upon the attention of the Con gress, with a plan for the relief of the situation approved by those well able to judge of its mer its. Wniie this subject remains without effect- ive consideration, many laws have been passed , providing for the holding of terms of inferior courts at places to suit the convenience of loc a ities or to lay the foundation of an application for the erection of a new public building. Repeated recommendations have been sub mitted for the amendment and change of the laws relating to our public lands, so that their spoliation and diversion to other uses than as homes for honest settlers might be prevented, j While a measure to meet this conceded neces- I slty of reform remains awaiting the action of the Congress many claims to the public lands and applications for their donation in favor of States and individuals have been allowed. A plan in a.id of Indian management, recom mended by those well Informed as containing valuable features in furtherance of the solution of the Indian problem, has thus far failed or legislative sanction, while grants or doubtful expediency to railroad companies, permitting them to pass through Indian reservations, have greatly multiplied. The propriety and necessity or the erection or one or more prisons for the confinement of United States convicts and a post-office build ing in the National capital are not disputed, but these needs yet remain unanswered, while scores of public buildings have been erected where their necessity for public purpose is not apparent. A revision of our pension laws should be made, which would rest upon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant. But while our general pension laws remain con fused and imperfect, hundreds "f our private pension laws are annually passed which are the sources of unjust discrimination and pop ular demoralization. Appropriation bills for the support of the Government are defaced by items and provis ions to meet private ends and it is freely as serted by responsible and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for public in ternal improvement would fail to meet with favor, unless it contained items more for local and private advantage than for public benefit. These statements can be much emphasized by an ascertainment of the proportion of Federal legislation, which either bears upon its face its private character or which, upon examination, develops such a motive power. And yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representatives such patriotic action as will advance the welfare of the entire country and this expectation can only be answered by the performanoe of public duty with unselfish pur pose. Our mission among the nations or the earth and our success in accomp i-hlng the work God has given the American people to do, require of those intrusted with the making and execu tion of our laws, perfect devotion, above all other things, to the public g od. This devotion will lead us to strongly resist all impatience of constitutional limitations of Federal power and to persistently check the increasing tendency to extend the scope of Federal legislation into the domain of State and local jurisdiction upon the plea of subserving the public welfare. The preservation of the partitions between proper subjects of Federal and local care and regulation, is of such importance under the Constitution, which is the law of our very ex istence that no consideration of expedience or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubtful ground. We huve undertaken to dis cover and proclaim the richest blessings of a free Government with the Constitution as our guide. Let us follow the way it points out. It will not mislead. And surely no one who has taken upon himself the solemn obligation to support and preserve tho Constitution can find justification or solace for disloyalty in the excu e that he wandend and disobeyed in search of a better way t reach the public wel fare than the Constitution offers. What has been said is deemed not inappro priate at a time when, from a century's height we view the way already trod by the American people and attempt to discover their future paths. The seventh President or the United States the soldier and statesman and at all times the firm and brave Mend or the people in vindication ol his course as the protector ot the popular rights and championship or true American citizenship, declared: "The ambition whichleads me on is an anxious desire and a fixed detcrmi ation to restore to the people, unimpaired, the sacred trust they have confided to my charge to heal the wounds of the Constitution and to prevent its violation. To persuade my countrymen, so far as I m y. that it Is not in a splendid government supported by powerful monop olies and aristocratic establishments that they will find happiness or their liberties pro tected, but in a plain system void of po p protecting oil and granting favors to none, dis pensing its blessin.s like the dew of Heaven, unseen and unfelt save in the rreshness and beauty thev contribute to produce. It Is such a Government the genius or our people requires such an one only under which our States may remain for ages to come united, prosperous and free." rORKIGN 

ATFAIRS. The President annonnces that the close of the year finds the United States in the enjoyment of domestic tranquility and at peace with aUthe Nations. Foreign relations have been strength ened and improved by performance of individual good offices and by new and renewed treaties of amity, commerce and reciprocity and extradi tion of criminals. The Fisheries question has not been satisfactorily adjusted, but since March 3d, 1S8T, no cases have been re ported to the Department of State wherein complaint has been made of unlawful or unfriendly treatment by Canadian authori ties in which reparation was not promptly and satisfactorily obtained bv the United States Consul-General at Hali ax. I continue in the opinion that the treaty or February last, which failed to receive the approval of the Senate, did supply "a satisfactory, practicable and final adjustment, on a basis honorable and just to both parties, to the difficult and vexed ques tion to which it related," and having subse quently ad unavailingly recommended other legislation to Congress which I hoped would suffice to meet the urgency created bv the rejection of the treaty, I now again invoke the earnest and Immediate attention of the Congress to the con dition of this Important question as it now stands before them and, the country, and forthe settlement of which I am deeply solicitous. The "West Incident Is treated as follows: "Near the close of the month of October last occurrences of a deeply regrettable nature were brought to my knowledge, which made it my painful but imperative duty to obtain, with as little delay as possible, a new personal chan nel of diplomatic Intercourse In this country with the Government of Great Britain. The correspondence in relation to this incident will in due course be laid before you and will disclose the unpardonable conduct of the offi cial referred to In his Interference by advice and counsel with the suffrages Tf American cit izens in the very crisis of the Presidential elec tion then near at hand and also In his subse quent action, superadding impugnment of the Executive and Senate of the United States in connection with important questprp now pend? tag In controversy bp;rn he twq govern ments. TJie offense thus committed was most grave, lnrolying disastrous possibilities to the good relations of the United States and Great Britain, cohstitating s gross breach of dJckunatlc nriiHeee and an invasion ot the purely domestic affairs and essential sore 1 re4grtyef.tto GamaMtt tevkte fee woy was accredited Having first fulfilled the Just demands of international comity, by affording rull opportunity ror her Majesty's Government to act in relief of the situation I considered prolongation of the subject to be unwarranted and therefore decUned to further recognize the diplomatic character of the person who"e con tinuance in such function would destroy that which is essential to the good understanding of the two Governments, and was inconsistent with the welfare and self-respect of the Govern ment or the United States. The usual inter change or communication has since continued through her Majesty's legation in this city. The Presi ent calls attention to the need of measures to prevent the destruction of fur seals in Behring's sea. for a survey or the Alaskan boundary, to prevent new complica tions with England for measures to alleviate loss of life and property on the great lakes, especially a concession from Canada allow ing American vessels to go to the assi-tance of wrecks In Canadian waters, as Canadian ves sels are allowed to com into ours; the protec tion of citizens of French origin from demands formllttary service when they return to France; the return to German steamship lines of inter est upon tonnage illegally exacted The Presi dent calls attention to our relations with Samoa: says the fund to recompense Chine.e citizens for injuries received in this country awaits acceptanc by China, and the exclusion of this class will probably prevent repetition of such troubles Japan still wants our good offices in helping her establish her right to con trol her own commerce: the establishment of consulates in Corea is recommended; the United States is looking after her citizens in Hayti, but is endeavoring to main tain proper neutrality the treaty with Hawaii having been extended caUs up the rommercial ixnpoitance of a sub marine telegraph to Honolulu. A commercial treaty should be concluded with Mexico and appropriation made for a pre cise relocation of our boundary with that coun try. The Mexican Government shows a very friendly spirit in its co-operation in the main tenance of peace along the international bound ary. The President then caUs attention to our relations with Central and South American States and the claims of certain of our citizens against Chill, Ecuador and Venezuela As authorized by the Congress, preliminary steps have been taken for the assemblage at this capital during the coming ear of the rep resentatives of South and Central American States, together with those of Mexico. Hayti and San Domingo, to discuss sundry important monetary and commercial topics. Excepting in those cases where from reasons of contiguity or territory and the existence of a border line in capable of being guarded, reciprocal commer cial treaties may be round expedient, it is believed that commercial policies inducing Ireer mutual exchange of products can be most advantageously arranged by independent but co-operative legislation. In the mode last men tioned the control of our taxation for revenue will be always retained in our hands, unre stricted by conventional agreements with other Governments. 

IMMIGRATION. With the rapid increase of immigration to our shores and the facilities of modern travel abuses or the generous prlvileees offered by our naturalizati n laws call for their careful revision. The easy and unguarded manner in which certificates or American citizenship can now be obtained has induced a class, un fortunately large, to avail themselves of the opportunity to become absolved from alleg iance to their native land and yetby a foreign residence to escape any just duty and contribu tion of service to the country of their proposed adoption. Thus while evading the duties of citizenship Xo the United States they may make prompt claim for its national protection and demand its intervention in their behalf. International complications of a seri ous nature arise and the correspondence ot the State Department discloses the great number and complexity or the questions which have been raised. Our laws regulating the issue or passports should be carerully revised and the institution or a central bureau or registration at the capital is again strongly recommended. By this means rull particulars or each case or naturalization in the United States would be secured and prope Iy indexed and recorded, and thus many cases ol spurious citizenship would be detected and unjust responsibilities would be avoided. The maritime powers have also been invited to confer in Washington in April next regard ing uniform rules for the security of life and property at sea. THE CONSULAR SERVICE. The reorganization of the consular service is a matter of senous importance to our National Interests. The number of existing principal consular offices Is believed to bo greater than is at all necessary for the conduct or the public business. I repeat the recommendations here tofore made by me that the appropriation Tor the maintenance or our dinlomatic and consular service should be recast, that the so-called no tarial or unofficial fees which our representa tives abroad are now enabled to treat as per sonal perquisites should be forbidden: that a system or consular inspection should be insti tuted, and that a limited number or secretaries or legation-at large should be authorized. THE WASHINGTON CENTENNIAL. Preparations ror the centennial celebration on April 30, 1BS!, or the inauguration of George Washington as President of the United States at the city of New York have been made by a voluntary organization or the citizens or that locality, and believing that an opportunity should be afforded ror the expression or the in terest relt throughout the country in this event, I respectfully recommend fitting and co-operative action by Congress on behalf of the people or the United States. THE 

TREASTJRT. The report of the Secretary or the Treasury shows that the total ordinary revenues of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1S8S amounted to 8379,266,074 76, of which 821f.091,174.G3 was received rrom customs duties and tl!M,S6,671 93 rrom internal taxes The total receipts from aU sources exceeded thoso for the fiscal year ended June 30, 18S7, by $7,802,797.10. The ordinary expenditures of the fiscal year ending June 3", 18S8, were S9,C53, 85S.G7, leaving a surplus of 1119,6 '2,116.09. The decrease In these expenditures as com pared with the fiscal year ended Juno 30, 18S7, was 88,278,221.31, notwithstanding the payment or more than 83,000,00 ror pensions In excess or what was paid ror that purpose In the latter mentioned year. The revenues or the Government ror the year ended June 30, 16S3, ascertained for tho quarter ended Sep tember SO, 888, and estimated for the re mainder of the time, amount to 8"i77,000, and the actual and estimated ordinary expendi tures for the same years are 8273,00 '.00, leaving an estimated surplus of 1104,000,08. The estimated receipts for the year ending June SO, 1890, are 8377,000,' CO, and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the same time are 8275,767,483.34, showing a surplus or $101,23', 511.66. The foregoing statements oZ surplus do not take into account the sum necessary to be expended to meet the requirements of the sink ing fund act, amounting to more than 847,000,000 annually. The cos tot collecting the customs rev enues for the last fiscal year was .44 per cent.; for the year 18S3 it was 3.77 per cent The excess of internal revenue taxes collected during the last fiscal year over those collected forthe year ended June 30, 16S7, was 85,489,' 174.26, and the cost ot collecting this revenue decreased from 3.4 per cent. In 1837 to less than 3.2 per cent, for the last year. Bonds of the Government not yet due have been purchased up to and Including the 30th day of November, 1883, amounting to $9J,700,4'.O, the premium paid thereon amounting to $17,508,613.03. The premium, added to the principal of these bonds,, represents an investment yielding about 2 per cent. Interest for the time they still had to run, and the sav ing to the Government represented by the dif ference between the amount of interest at 2 per cent, upon the sura paid for principal and premium and what would iare paid for interest at the rate specified in the bgnds. U they hid run to thajr maturity is about" fST.ltelqpO. At s$ sight this wpulo; seen to be a profitable and sensible, transaction on the part of the Govern ment, but' as suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury the surplus thus- expended for the purchase of bonds was money drawn fasafe people in excess of any actual geed, oi tiie Gov ernment and was o expended father thai; aow. It to remain in the treasury! " At the close of the flssal year ended June 3T, W7, there fed icgisdisdartheejJr sory Silver Coinage act t26G,9?S.SS0 in silver dol lars, 85ii0,50l,310 of which nere in the hands of the people on the 30th day or June, 1SS8. There had been coined S.'M.TiWX and or this 8829, 303 was in circulation in coin and SJ00,327.376 in silver certificates, for the redemption ot which silver dollars to that amount were held by the Goverdment. The Secretary recommends the suspension or the fcrther coinage of silver, and in such recom mendation I earnestly concur. THE ARMT. The Secretary of War reports that the army, at the date of the lat consolidated returns, con sisted of 2,180 officers and 24,549 enlisted men. The actual expenditures of the War Depart ment for the Heal year ended June 30. 1888, amounted to 8tl, 165,1 7.i'7, of which sum 9. 58, 514.63 was expended for public works, including river and harbor improvements. I earnestly request that the recommenda tions contained in the Secretary's report, all ol which are, in my opinion, calculated to in crease the usefulness and discipline of the army may receive the consideration of the Congress, among these the proposal that there should be provided a plan for the examination of officers to test their fltne;s for promotion is of the ut most importance. This reform has been before recommended in the reports of the Secretary, ana its expediency is so fully demonstrated by the argument he presem sin its favor that its adoption should no longer be neglected, The death of General Sheridnn in August last was a National affliction. The army then lost the grandest of its chiefs. The country lost a brave and experienced soldier, a wise and discreet counselor, and a modest and sensible man. Those who in any manner came within the range ol his personal association will never fall to pay deserved and willing homage to his greatness and the glory of his career, out they will cherish with more tender sensibility the loving memory ot his simple, generous and considerate nature. THE NAVY. The report ot the Secretary or the Navy demonstrates very intelligent management in that important department and discloses the most satisfactory progress in the work of re constructing the navy made during the past year. Of the ships In course of construction, five, viz.: The Charleston, the Baltimore, the York, the Vesuvius and the Petrel have in that time been launched and are rapidly approach ing completion. The Philadelphia, the San Francisco, the Newark, the Bennington, the Concord and the Herreshoff torpedo boats aro all under contract for delivery to the depart ment during the next year. The progress already made and being made gives good ground for the expectation that these eleven vessels will be incorporated as part of the American navy within the next twelve months. The report shows that, notwithstanding the large expenditures for new construction, and tho additional labor they involve, the total ordinary or current expenditures of the de partment Tor the three years ended Juno 30, 1SSS, are less by more than 20 per cent, than such expenditures for the three years ended June 30, 18S1. The various steps which have been taken to improve tho business methods of theDepaitment are reviewed bv the Secre tary. The purchasing of supplies has been con solidated and placed under a responsible bu reau head. This has resulted in the curtail ment of open purchases, which in the years 18S4 and 1833 amounted to over 50 per cent, of all the purchases of the department, to less than 1 per cent.: so that at the present time about 90 per cent, ol the total departmental purchases are made by contract and after competition. As the expenditures on this account exceed on an average of 2,000,000 annually, it is evident that an important improvement on the system has been inaugurated and tuns tan tial economies introduced. ' THE POST-OffFICX. The report or the Postmaster-General shows a marked increase of business in every branch or the postal service. The numberof post-offices on July 1, 1SS8, was 57,370, an Increase of 6, 124 In three years and of 2,210 ror the last fiscal year. Free delivery offices have increased rrom 189 in the fiscal year ended June 3, 18S7, to 35 in the y-ar ended June 30, lsS. In the railway mall service there has been increase in one year or 163 routes, and in tbe number or miles traveled per annum an increa-e or 130,195.917.43. Tho estimated increase or railroad service for the year was 6,06' miles but the amount of new railroad service actually put on was 12.704.50 miles. The volume or business in the money order division including transactions In postal notes, reached the sum of upwards of 143 millions for the year. During the past year parcel post con ventions have been concluded with B.irbadoes. the Bahamas, British Honduras and Mexico and are now under negotiation with all the Central and South American States. The in- rease for correspondence with foreign countries during th past three years is gratify ing and is especially notable and exceptional witb the Central and South American States and Mexico. As the greater part of mail matter exchanged with these countries is i om merclal in its character this increase is evi dence of the increased business relations with them. The practical operation or the parcel post convention so fir as ncgoti.-ited has served to fulfil the most favorable prediction as to their benefits. In January last a general postal con. vention was negotiated with the Dominion or Canada, which went into operation March 1 and which practically makes one postal territory or tl United States and Cunada. Under it mer chandise parcels may now be transmitted through the mails at fourth class rates or post age. It is not possible here to touch even the lead ing heads of the great postal establishment to illiterate tho enormous anil rapid growth of the lit :s and the needs for legislative readjust ment of much or its machinery that it has out grown. For these and valuable reccommenda tions or the Postma ter General attention is invited to his report. A department whose revenues have increased from 19,772,0 0 in 1870 to $-12,7 0.000 in 1838, despite reduction of post age which bave enormously re need rates or revenue while dally increasing its business de mands the careful consideration of the Congress as to all matters suggested by those familiar with its operations and which are calculated to increase its efficiency and usefulness. Or the total number or postmasters 54,874 ar or the fourth class. These, of course, receive no allowances whatever for expenses in the ser vice, end their compensation is fixed by per centages on receipts at their respective offices. This rate of compensation may have been and probably was. at one time, just, but the stand ard has remained unchanged through the sev eral reductions in the rates of postage. Such reductions have necessarily cut down the com pensation of these officials while it undoubtedly increased the business performed by them. Simple justice requires a mention of this sub ject to the end that fourth-class postmasters may receive at least on equivalent to that which the law itself fixing the rate intended for them. Another class of postal employes whose con diton seems to demand legislation is that of clerks in post-offices, and I call especi 1 atten. tion to the repeated recommendations of the Postmaster-General for their classification, Proper legislation of this character for the relief of carriers in the free delivery service has been frequent. Provision is made for their promotion for substitutes for them on vaca tion; for substitutes for holidays, and limiting their hours of labor. Seven million dollars has been appropriated for the current year to pro vide for them, though the total number of of fices where they are employed is but 358 for the past fiscal year, with an estimated increase for the current year or but forty, while the total appropriation for all clerks in offices through out the United States is 85.950.ooa 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, The transactions or the Department of- Jus tice for the fiscal year ended June 3 , 1888, "are contained In. tiie epon'ol the "Attorney-General, as wen," as a number of valnable recom mendations.' the most of which are repetitions ol those previously made and ought to recejjn consideration. It is stated In this rcftrV1.! though judgments in civil ujt. Amounting to, r$.021. 8. were. af$-ft"ta,taYoi'o.tth'e Gpf-ern-ne.niTjdunag theT year, only the sum of $132, fcil tj-as cpllefcted thereon":' and that though fines, penalties' and forfeitures were, imposed amounting to RU,8W 43, only &$ of thai sum was paid on actjaffct thereof. These fact l W finish, a Uluttratien of the KatijBi Ytucb MtMstfcir prevails that a tr '9 " debt due the Government should cause no in covenience to the citizen. It also appears from this report that though prior to March, 1835. there had been but six convictions In the Ter itories of Utah and Idaho under the laws of 1SC2 and IS32, punish ing polygamy a d unlawful cohabitation as crimes, there have been since that date nearly six hundred convictions under the laws and statutes of 1837. and the opinion is expressed that under such a firm and vigilant execution of these laws and the advance of ideas opposed to the forbidden practices, polygamy within the United States is virtually at an end. Suits instituted by the Government under the provisions of the act of March 3, 1SS7, for the termination or the corporations known as the perpetual Emigrating Fund Company and the Church of Jesus Christ or Latter Day Saints have resulted, in a degree, favorable to the Government, declaring the charters of these corporations forfeited and escheating their property. Such property, amounting in value to more than f 600,0.0 is in the hands or a re ceiver, pending further proceedings, an appeal having been taken to the Supreme Court of the United States. PUBLIC LAND MATTERS. In the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which will be laid before you, the condition of the various branches of our domestic affairs connected with that Department and its opera tions during the past year are fully exhibited. But a brief reference to some of the subjects discussed in this able and interesting report j can do nere maae, out i recommend tne enure report to the attention or Congress and trust that the sensible and valuable recommenda tions it contains will secure carctul considera tion. I can not too strenuously insist on the im portance ot proper measures to insure a right disposition of our public lands, not only as a matter of present justice but in forecast of the consequences to future generations. The broad, rich acres or our agricultural plains have been long preserved by nature to become her untrammelled gift to a people civilized and free upon which should rest. In well distributed ownership, the numerous homes of enlightened, equal and fraternal citizens. We came to Na tional possession with the warning example in our eyes of the entail of inequities of landed proprietorship which other countries have per mitted and still suffer. We have no excuse for the violation of prin ciples, cogently taught by reason and example, nor for tbe allowance ot pretexts which have sometimes exposed our land to colossal greed. Laws which open a door to fraudulent acquisi tion or an administration which permits the rapacious seizure by a ravored few of the ex panded areas that many should enjoy are ac cessory to offenses against our National welfare and humanity and can not be too severely con demned or punished. It is gratifying to know that something has been done at last to redress the Injuries to our people and check the perilous tendency of tho reckless waste of National domain. That over eighty million acres have been wrested from illegal usurpation. Improvident grants and fraudulent entries and claims must afford a profound gratification to right feeling citizens as it is a recompense for the labors and struggles of the recovery. Our dear experience ought sufficiently to urge the speedy enactment or measures of legisla tion which will confine the future disposition or our remaining agricultural lands to the uses ot actual husbandry and genuine homes. Nor should our vast tracks of so-called desert land be yielded up to the monopoly of corporations or grasping individuals as app -ars to be much the tendency under tbe existing statutes. The lands require but the supply of water to become fertile and productive. It is a problem of great moment how more wisely for tho public good that factor shall be furnished I can not but think it perilous to suffer either those lands or the sources of their irrigation to rail into the hands or monopolies which by such means, may exercise lord.-hip over areas dependent on their treatment for productiveness. Already steps have been taken to secure ac curate and scientific information of the condi tions which is the principal basis of lntell'gent act on. Until this shall be gathered, the course of wisdom appears c early to be in a suspension or further disposal which only promises to create rights antagonistic to the common in terest. No harm can follow this cautionary conduct. The land will remain, and the public good presents no demand lor hasty disposses sion of Nationalo.mershlp and control. I commend also the recommendations that appropriate measures be taken to complete the adjustment of the various grants made to the States for Internal improvements and of swamp and overflowed lands as well as to adjudicate and finally determine the validity and extent of the numerous private land claims. All these arc elements of great Injustice and peril to the settlers upon the localiti s affected, and now that their exitenci" can not be avoided no duty is more pressing than to fix as soon as possible their bounds and terminate the threats of trouble which arise rrom uncertainty. THE 

INDIANS. The condition of our Indian population con tinues to improve and the proofs multiply that the transforming chan e so much to be desired, which shall substitute for barbarism enlighten ment and civilizing education, is in favorable progress. Allotments in severalty have been made on some reservations, until all those en ti led to land thereon have had their shares assl ned, and the work is si ill continued. As soon as possible community in land should cease, by opening up such as remain unallotted to settlement Contact with the ways of industrious and successful farmers will perhaps add u healthy emulation which "ill both instruct and stimulate. But no agency for the amelioration of this peopl- appears to be so promising as the ex tension urged by the Secretary or such com plete facilities of education as shall at the the e.irliest possible day embrace all teach able Indian youths of both sexes and retain them with a kindly and beneficent hold until their characters are formed and their faculties trained. The Apache Indians at Mount Vernon bar racks. Ala., are being well cared for and their children carerully educated, and there is no good reason why they should he returned to the reservation. Thi-y should be kept in restraint. MEN310NS. The number of pensions added to the roll during the fiscal year ended June 30, 18S8, is &252. and incieaseof pension was granted m 45,716 cases. The names of 173 pensioners were dropped from the rolls during the year for various causes, and at the olose of the year the number of pensioners was45i5"7 Or these there were Stf survivors or the war or 112, 10.787 widows or those who served In that war: 16.000 soldiers ot the Mexican war and 5.101 widows or said soldiers. One hundred and two different rates of pen sions are paid to these beneficiaries, ranging from 12 to 416.66 per monh. The amount paid for pensions during the fiscal year was 878,775,651.91, being an increao over the pre ceding year of 8 ,00421 .'. The expanses at tending the maintenance and operation of the Pension Bureau during that period was $3,V62. 52,67, making the entire expenditures of the bureau $82,038.2 7. being 214 per cent, or the gross income an I nearly 31 per cent, or the to tal expenditures ot the Government during the year. I am thoroughly convinced that onr general pension laws should be revised and adjusted to meet, as far as possible in the light of our ex perience. all meritorious cases. The fact that one hundred and two different rates of pensions are paid can not in my opinion be made con sistent with justice to the pensioners or to the Government, and the numerous private pen sion bills t at are pausd, predicated upon the imperfection, ci general laws, while they in crease I.A many, cases existing inequality a&d.'lnjustice, lend additional force to tne' recommendation for a revision of the general laws on this subject. The laxity or ideas prevailing amosg a large numberof our people regarding pensions is be coming every dajr mexe marked. The principles upon which, they- should be granted are in dan ger t being altogether ignored, and already pensions are often claimed because: the appli cants are as much entitled a ether successful applicants, raUiP? than upoa any disabil ity' reasonably attnbtatei to mii HJTleo, " the estabU.- -J YariQM precedents mtfi?Z, .l theeraatlnsofpeo-- ' jtined. side- ot"er uuworthy and irrelevant con- lions, and the honorable name ot veteran Kufcuriy becomes by these means but another term for one who constantly 'clamors for the aid ot the Government there is danger that injury will be done to the fame and patr otism of many whom our citizens delight to honor, and that a prejudice will be aroused unjust to meritori ous applicants for pensions. AGRICULTURE. The Department of Agriculture has continued with a good measure of success in its efforts to develop the processes, enlarge the result and augment the profits of American husbandry. It has collected and distributed practical information, introduced and tested new plants, checked the spread or contagious diseases or farm animals, resisted the advance ot noxious insects and destructive fungus growths and sought to secure to agricultural labor the highest reward of effort and the full est immunity from loss. Its records or the year show tbat the season ot 1S83 has been one df medium production. A generous supply of the demands of consumption has been assured and a surplus for exportation, moderate in certain products :ind bountiful in others, will prove a benefaction alike to buyer and grower. Four years ago it was found that the great cattle Industry of the country was endangered and those engaged In it were alarmed at the rapid extention of the European lung plague of pleuro-pneumonio. Serious outbreaks existed in Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky, and in Tennessee animals affected were held in quarantine. Five counties in New York and from one to four counties each in the States ot New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland were almost equally affected. With the great danger upon us and with the con tagion already in tbe channels of commerce; with the enormous direct and indirect losses already being caused by it, and when only prompt and energetic action could be success ful, there were in none of these States any laws authorizing this department to eradicate the malady or giving the State officials power to co operate for this purpose. The depart ment even lacked both the requisite ap propriation and authority. Bv securing State co-operation in connection with authority rrom Congress, the work of eradica tion has been pressed successfully and this dreaded disease has been extirpated from the Western States, with the exception ot a few re stricted areas which are still under supervision The danger has thus been removed and trade and commerce have been free I from tho vexatious State rcstr etiona which were doemed necessary for a time An exhaustive study has also within the same period been undertaken of the subject of food adulteration and the best analytical method for determining it. A part ot the results of this work has already been published by the department, which, with the matter in course of preparation, will make the moat complete treatise on that "sub'ect that ever has been published In any country The de partment seeks a prorress.ivc development. It would combine the discoveries of science with the economies anl amelioration of rural prac tice. A supervision of the en owed experi ment tl station sy.-tcm recently provided for, is a proper function of the depart ment and is new in op' ration. This super vision is very important and should be wisely and vigilantly directed to the end that the pe cuniary aid of the Government in favor of in telligent agriculture should be so applied as to result in the general good and to the benefit ot all our people thus ju-tlf in tho a; propna tions made from the public treasury During the past four years the process of dif fusion as ap; lied to tho manu'.icture of ugar from sorghum and sugar cane has been intro duced into this country and fully perfected by the experiments carried on by the department. This process is now universally considered to be the most economical one, and It is through it that the sorghum sugar industry has been established upon a firm basis and tbe road to its future success opened. Thp adoption ot this diffusion process is nlso-ettciiding in Louisiana and other sugar producing parts of the country and will probobly be the on y method employed for the extraction ot sugar rrom the cane. The Government's relations with land grant roads arc taken up and the District or Columbia affairs treated at length. The President con cludes: The consciousness that I have presented but an imperfect statement ot the condition or our country and its wants occasions no tear that any thing omitted is not known and appreciated by the Congress upon whom rests tho responsibility or intelligent legislation in behalf or a great Nation and sx confiding people. As public ser vants we shall do our own duty well if we con stantly guard the rectitude of our intentions, maintain unsullied our love of country, and with unselfish purpose strike for the publio good.
