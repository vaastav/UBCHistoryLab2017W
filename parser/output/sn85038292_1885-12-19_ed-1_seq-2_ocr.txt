®Uc Jcmocvatic gutiwat*. WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19,1886. Christmas. This joyous season is the greatest festival of the year. It conies at its close, when all its labors have been finished, the crops of the husbandman gathered in, and Nature herself in a state of repose. The forests are bare, the fields have put olf their garniture of green and donned a robe ot sober russet which they ; will wear through the winter, and until the vernal season restores to them again their ( emerald hue. Man has leisure for retrospec tion. He can look back over the events of the year, and count up his losses and his gains. He can sec wherein ho was wrong, and how far he was right; and from the light of experience he can mark out his future course, determining meanwhile to avoid the one and pursue the other. Christmas is a time for the reunion of fam ilies. The aged heads of the household hail it with joy on that account. Some loved one has been absent from the old homestead for a twelvemonth, and is expected to return again beneath the parental roof, and to min gle, it may be, with brothers and sisters, who like himself have gone out from the home of their childhood to build a home of their own, leaving the aged parents the sole occupants of the family roof-tree that sheltered them from infancy until now. How this hallowed season knits and unites in the bonds of the tenderest j affection those who have thus been sundered, j The bosom swells with delight at the return j of the season, and the heart overflows with its richest treasure of love. Children hail the time with an intensity of delight unapproachable by their seniors. They anticipate the good cheer which it brings in its train. They hove learned the old, old story of good Santa Claus, and their thoughts are busy with the good things they expect the Saint to bring them. Their mirth and mer- j riment are contagious. It runs through all | the household, and seizes upon father and mother in particular. Their hearts overflow with the kindliest feeling and it manifests it self in gifts which gladden the hearts of the children in turn. Nor is this feeling confined to the home circle alone. It flows out to neighbors and friends, and to the poor, who j are made glad by these Christmas offerings, i while the donors themselves realize that it is , “more blessed to give than to receive. The devout Christian, perhaps, has the j liveliest appreciation of the holy season of all j More than eighteen hundred years have passed \ away since the groat event which the recur- | rencc of Christmas commemorates, and yet its influences upon the heart and mind are as , fresh and strong to-day as they were then. More than eighteen hundred years have passed since the shepherds upon the plains of Judea heard with wonder and delight, from celestial visitants, “glad tidings of great joy" on the advent of the Messiah, and yet the theme is as dear to the heart to-day as when it was first heralded down to earth by the songs of the angels. Guided by a strange peculiar star, the magi came to pay him homage, and to otter gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. As they were moved to offer their adoration to the Rube of Bethlehem, so does the devout Christian, on the return of this glad festival, adore him with an intensity of feeling which language may but feebly express. The loftiest ascriptions of praise and adoration fall short of the soul s desire when filled with gratitude for the infi nite condescension and immeasurable love set forth in the scheme of man's redemption. Even the song of the angels—“ Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will to men”—fails to measure up to the sublime height of the soul’s yearnings and aspirations for fullness of utterance under a proper reali zation of this great boon to the human race. The advent has been the theme of the poet through all the centuries since. Pope and Pollock, Milton, Young and others, stirred by the divine afflatus, have sung of the Mes siah, attuning their harps to the loftiest min strelsy; but nothing we can now recall to memory exceeds in fervor of spirit and charm of poetic numbers, the sacred eclogue of Pope’s Messiah, extracts of which we append, byway of close. Rapt into future times the ban] begun. A virgin shall conceive, a virgin bear a Son, From Jesse’s root behold a brunch arise, Whose sacred llower with fragrance tills the The ethereal spirit o’er its leaves shall move. And on its top descends the mystic dove. Ye heavens! from high the dewy nectar pour, And in soft silence shed the kindly shower; The siek and weak the healing plant shall aid. From storms a shelter and from heal a shade. All crimes shall cease, and ancient frauds shall tail. Returning Justice lift aloft her scale; Peace o’er the world her olive wand extend. And white-robed innocence from heaven descend. Swift 11 y the years, and rise, the expected morn . Oh, spring to life, auspicious Habe, be born ! Hark! a glad voice the lonely desert cheers; Prepare the way ! A God, a ( iod appears I A God, a God, the vocal hills reply, The rocks proclaim the approaching Deity . Lo! earth receives Him from the bending skies. .Sink down, ye mountains, and ye valleys rise, With heads declined, ye cellars, homage pay; He smooth, ye rocks, ye rapid floods, give way. The Saviour comes! by ancient bards foretold . Hear him, vc deaf, and all ye blind, behold; He from thick Aims shall purge the visual ray, And on the sightless eye ball pour the day ; Tis he the obstructed paths ot sound shall clear, And bid new music charm the unfolding ear; The dumb shall sing, the lame his crutch forego, And leap, exulting, like the bounding roe. No sigh, no murmur, the wide world shall hear; From every face he wipes oil’every tear: In adamantine chains shall death be bound. And hell’s grim tyrant feel the eternal wound. ♦ * ‘ * * * Rise, crowned with light, imperial Salem, rise! Exalt thy towering head, and lift thine eyes . See a long race thy spacious courts adorn; Sec future sons and daughters yet unborn, in crowding ranks on every side arise. Demanding life, impatient for the skies. Sec barbarous nations at thy gates attend. Walk in thy light and in thy temple bend; See thy bright altars, thronged with prostrate kings And heaped with products of Sabcan springs. For thee Idnme’s spicy forests blow. And seeds of gold in Ophir’s mountains glow. See heaven its sparkling portals wide display, And break upon them in a flood of day ! No more the rising sun shall gild the morn, Nor evening Cynthia till her silver horn: Rut lost, dissolved, in thy superior rays, One tide of glory, one unclouded blaze. . O’erflow thy courts; the Light himself shall slime Revealed, and God’s eternal day be thine. The seas shall waste, the skies in smoke decay, Rocks fall (Lo dust, and mountains melt away; Rut lix’d his word, his saving power remains, Thy realm forever lasts, thy own Messiah reigns . The effort to form a new county from por tiona Of Prince Georges, Montgomery, Anne Arundel and Howard counties, with the conn ty seat at Laurel, which is now being mad( by residents of that village and vicinity, wil likely come to naught. Howard is smal enough now, and the populations of the other are none too large'. TT the people to be em braced in the new county would stop to con eider the cost of their undertaking, they wouh speedily drop it. There is no doubt som occasional inconvenience to those remot from their county seats in attending courts kc., but that is a small matter when compare to the excessive taxation that must be borne fo some years in erecting county buildings. A all times the taxes must be high, for the tax able basis would be small, and the populatio could not be made large, because other conn ties could not be reduced much. The forma tion of another county would add to the mem bership of the Legislature, which is now er tirely too large. The Maryland Senators and Democrat! Representatives are working as a unit a Washington in all important matters of legis lation and as to securing appointments t office. Last week they visited several of th departments In the interest of applicant for position. In Boston, Massachusetts, on Tuesday th Democrats elected their candidate for Mayo by,a majority of 9,000, the largest majorit, ever given a mayoralty candidate in that city The Democracy is growing stronger all ove the country. With the last issue the Enquirer , of Uppe Marlborough, Md., closed its third volume It is always entertaining, bright, newsy, has i large advertising patronage, and Us cireula tkm is rapidly increasing. Schemes to Lessen the Surplus. It has been said that it is impossible to con duct the government honestly with an over flowing treasury. In order to build up and maintain manufactories and monopolies, Con gress keeps up high tariffs, and robs the peo ple annually of many millions of dollars not needed for the economical uses of the govern ment. While the government collects a sur plus, the generosity of our national legislators is unbounded and often oversteps constitu tional limitations. There arc two schemes now on hand to absorb some of the excess revenue and more will be invented. One is to grant Gen. Grant's widow an annuity of 

S3OOO and Hie franking privilege, and another is to establish a home for disabled ex-Confed erates. Next, it is likely, will be a proposition to pay to Mrs. Hendricks her husband’s salary up to March 4th, next, with perhaps an annual pension. There is no warrant for any such expenditures, and no necessity for making them. Mrs. Grant is rich, havingover §300,- 000; the ex-Confederates have managed to get along for over twenty years without govern ment aid, and Mrs. Hendrick's is abundantly provided for. It is time for economy now, and a reduction of the unnecessary burdens of the people. ____________ In discussing the new code of joint rules on Tuesday, the Senate drifted into a discussion on the use and sale of liquor in the Capitol. The former rules forbid their sale, and the new code reenacts the prohibition. Senator Cockrell, of Missouri, remarked that the rule was a farce, and read the list of liquors and wines from the menu of the Senate restaurat eur, then added that he had been brought from the Prohibition State of Maine by Senator j j Frye, of that State, who, as chairman of the j | committee on rules, at all times had power to - enforce the rule and repress the sale of liquors and wines. Other Senators alluded to the immoderate use ot stimulants, and one went . so far as to say that the Senate occasionally j had to adjourn on account of the inebriated i condition of some ot the members. Ihe old | rule was perhaps a blind to delude the people, i and it is likely the new code will include the j rule against intoxicants, as a further blind, while those who believe in taking a little wine for the stomach s sake will continue to tip the glasses. From the tone of the debate it is quite evident that very many of the learned i Senators are not camels, and can t go two weeks without drinking. \ The Supreme Court of Ohio has reversed ! the decision of the Circuit Court ot Hamilton I county. The effect of this decision is tc give ■ the Democrats three majority in the Senate. I In the House the Republicans will have six | majority, and a majority of three on joint bal lot. The Senate being Democratic, the Re publican scheme to re-district the state, in i order to secure more Republican members in Congress, will be thwarted. Senator Sher | nl an, too, may find some difficulty in securing his re-election to the United States Senate. ■ There is an effort being made to oust him. If i two Republicans refuse to support him, they | can, bv obtaining the Democratic vote, elect some other Republican. It is said that more ■, than two arc opposed to his return. I hese, | however, may be holding oil for a reward. - j \ number ot bills were introduced in both houses of Congress this week, many of only ' j local importance. The Senate passed a bill j providing for members of the cabinet to suc , j ceed to the Presidency in the event of the death or inability ol both the President and • j Vice-President, the Secretary of State stand . ; ing first in the line of succession, then the | Secretary of the Treasury, and in succession to the other members. The House it is thought, will pass the hill promptly. Both I i houses have spent most of the week in dis ! cussing a new code ot rules, and very little . will be done until after the holidays. The : i House committees have not yet been made up. Two or three weeks ago the Ahvocatk pub ; fished an interview with a Philadelphia re [ ( porter of Frank Thoma, who spoke of frauds I in the Agricultural Department at Washing ton, and how he had received an appointment . ; as clerk through the influence of Thomas C. i i Morrow, editor and proprietor of the \V ash i ington Gazette. Thoma also said that he never f was in hut one room at the Department, and , that was when he drew his salary twice a month, which was paid over to Morrow, and | never rendered any service for the salary. On Saturday Morrow was arrested, and Gen. Carmen, chief clerk during the lime 1 homa was carried on the pay roll, and from whom he received his appointment, has also been arrested. ____________ Notwithstanding the unjust attacks of the Mugwumps, Dudes and Republicans, who joined forces last fall, on the municipal gov ernment of Baltimore, the city’s credit is high. Recently bids were advertised for §500,000 of the city’s water loan, bearing a low rate ot interest. The bids were opened on Tuesday, and aggregated nearly live millions of dollars. The successful bidders were Blake Brothers & Co., of Boston, who take the whole §300.- i 000 at §113.03, which is a large premium and aggregates §0,323. Gov. Hill, of New York, is said to be as able a manager and organizer as Mr. Tilden was when in his prime, and is the great leader |of the New York Democracy. He and his j lieutenants are now preparing for the election ■ next year, and are confident of securing | enough members ot the legislature to give the I Democracy a majority on joint ballot, and , I thus secure a United States Senator. " I _ The Publication of the Laws. | From the Hagerstown A ewe. VV e are glad to see that two of the ablest and most influential exponents of progressive Democracy in Maryland, the estminstei i Advocatk and the Cambridge Chronicle, have raised their voices in favor of disseminating among the people the laws that they are ex pected to observe. “Ignorance ol the law excuses no man is an legal maxim, but it is very poor consolation to an unfortunate r ‘ citizen, who, through ignorance of a law e passed a few weeks before, may find himsel i- behind the bars of the county jail, mulcted it , heavy damages or compelled to pay a tine 6 This would be a rather unpleasant state o II circumstances, but one not at all unlikely tt .11 occur under the present condition of attain rs which causes laws to be enacted, and thei leaves those to be affected to find them out ii the best (or worst) way they can.

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Comments of tlie Press-A General Ex pression of Commendation. New York Times, (Rep.): “The confidence of the country in President Cleveland s sound judgment, in his practical good sense, and in his firm grasp of great public questions will be confirmed and increased by his first mes sage to Congress. It is something more and higher than a business message. W ithont conscious effort, apparently, and certainly without visible straining after either the lofty or the profound, the President has impressed on his message the stamp of a broad and sin cere patriotism.” New York World, (Dem.); “It is seldom that a document has issued from the Execu tive so full of information and instruction for the people. It is free from verbiage, is writ ten in a plain, business-like manner, treats of a large number of subjects and is positive and outspoken in the expression of opinions on the important issues of the hour. Ibe mes sage is a safe, clear, conservative paper, and upon the whole is an able state document. New Y'ork Sun, (Dem.): “The message is encyclopaedic in its presentation of details, full of information and of interest to every citizen, written with admirable clearness and with some variety of style.” New Y'ork Tribune, (Rep.); “The first mes sage of the President is a creditable paper. On some of the most important questions ot which it treats it deserves hearty praise.” New Y'ork Star, (Deni.): “As a whole the message will be received by the people with approval, and by the Democrats of the coun try with satisfaction and pride. From the first sentence to the final one there is no men tion of those differences which lately involved the land in war, and which afterward gave a long life to hatreds that became a food upon which a great party lived. Under the be nign rule of a Democratic government the land finds peace and rest from turmoil, and the happiness of a recreated patriotism. New York Mining Journal, (Ind.): “flic I President’s expression of Executive opinion j is like himself—frank, honest, clear-sighted, j statesmanlike and comprehensive. There is ]no uncertain note upon any key. It unites | in one harmonious symphony the glories, needs and duties of the republic. Hie Con gressman who studies this able state paper to advantage is thoroughly equipped for the i work he has on hand.” Boston Evening Traveller, (Rep.): “Ihe I message is an able one, and evinces on the | part of President Cleveland a comprehensive j grasp of the great questions of public policy | now before the people.” Hartford, Conn., Times, (Deni.): “The country will read the message and feel its ini- I portance and its excellence. | The Philadelphia Press (Rep. ) admits that the message is sound on most points, but adds: “His treatment of the tariff is not so satisfac tory." Philadelphia Enquirer, (Rep.): “Excepting alone upon the silver question the entire mes sage is of the most conservative character, it is not what may be called a brilliant one, but it is both instructive and interesting, and is likely to give very general satisfaction, and tend to give confidence to the representatives of the great manufacturing, commercial and financial interests ot the country. It is clear, direct and manly in manner and exhaustive in matter." Philadelphia North American (Rep.): "It is a paper well worth reading, and though very long drawn out, it is a creditable state paper, and will favorably compare with an nual messages since the government was founded. In its discussion of subjects upon which legislation may be required it is full, it • not exhaustive." Philadelphia Times (Ind.): "President Cleveland gives the most positive assurance to business and industry. 1 here is no am biguity in his language. \\ hat he believes he says; what he says he means, and he meets the question of revenue reform with a degree of candor and fidelity to our great business j and industrial interests that must command the general approval of business circles and the cordial trust of the whole nation. Pittsburg Dispatch (Rep.): "The message will add to the general conviction that Presi dent Cleveland is a sensible, safe and ex tremely cautions public man, who can be relied upon to do nothing to cause alarm dur ing his executive term.’ Pittsburg Commercial-Gazette! Rep.): "Ihe message is a plain, carefully considered and strikingly conservative document. Pittsburg Post (Dem.): “The message is broad and non-partisan in tone, thoroughly American, and shows a man at (he helm who has the needed faith in himselt, as well as the courage of his convictions. Philadelphia Ledger (Ind.!: "It is a clear, frank, vigorous document in its style, and business-like in its methods.” Washington Post (Dem.): “Upon the whole, | the President's message will please the peo ple. It will come to them as a fulfilment ol their most ardent expectations. It is set to a key of lofty and patriotic statesmanship and | breathes a love of country which is at once admirable and encouraging." —e -■ Vanderbilt’s Will. • j The provisions of the will of ffm. H. \an derbilt have been made public. Instead of j following the example of his father and leav -1 ing the vast body of his estate to a favored 1 son, the late Mr. Vanderbilt has divided his property into three parts. He leaves to his widow the magnificent mansion, so lately built and occupied, for the term of her life, and an 1 annual income ot two hundred thousand do!- i lars in lieu of dower. Forty millions of dol , hirs in United States and railroad bonds and stocks are bequeathed to the eight children ol 1 the deceased, share and share alike, in trust, j during their natural lives, with the right tc apply the income of the same to their respec ' live uses. They are prohibited from using - any part of the principal, but at the deatii ol i the beneficiary the sum accruing to them re '. spectively may be left in such shares or pro portions as they may devise to their children. 1 I Forty millions additional are to he divided in . equal shares among the eight children, with absolute power over their respective portions. Two millions of dollars, over and above tin R share allotted to him, is bequeathed to Cor nelius Vanderbilt. The minor and charitable I bequests reach, it is estimated, two and a-hall millions more —Mr. Depew estimates them at a much greater sum—making the total be quests about ninety-six millions ol dollars. • s The residue of the estate, supposed to hi i about as much more, is lo go in equal part; 1- to Cornelius and Win. K. \ anderbilt. The . wife and sons of the deceased are made exec s utors and trustees of the estate withou II charge, with provision for the appointment o g , other trustees during the continuance of tin e j trust fund in the event of any contingency j 1 arising that might make such uppointmeni I necessary. As briefly stated by Mr. Depew : ■ “Take the will in its broadest terms, and sel | aside the amount given in charity and tin amounts necessary to take care of the various annuities, which might he between §3,090,001 and §0,000,000, it leaves his eight childrei it §80,000,000, §40,000,000 of it in absolute own e er.ship. Then it leaves Cornelius and his r eldest sou §2,000,000 besides. Then it divide; e all the residue and remainder equally betweei g Cornelius and Win. K.” It is further statei -by him that the two brothers, Cornelius am v Win. K., who get the larger share of the es it tate, “are in the railroad business to stay,’ e and the inference is that the railroad proper iv ties they hold in trust, or have to manage fo If themselves, will be kept intact, and that con n sequently the death of their father will inak no change in the character of the securitie >f he held, or produce any serious disturbanci 0 in Wail street operations in those or othe •s stocks. n * * ■* u Views of the Maryland Senators ant n Representatives on the President’s 1- Message. s, i- The Washington correspondent of th ie Baltimore Sun the following as th y. i views of the Maryland Senators and four o j- i the Representatives on President Cleveland' 3- } message, after its first reading in both houses iv [ Senator Gorman said the President ha j"l | pleased the Northern and Eastern men by hi to ! utterances on the tariff and silver questions e.- j but his views on these questions were nc of | relished by some of the Southern and Wesl ly j ern men. So far as be is concerned indivit. s; j ually he considers the message a very satis 01 I factory and carefully drawn paper, perhaps ip | trifle too long, because too much space : a { given to details. se ! Senator Wilson, of Maryland, said he wa in ; unable to bear the reading throughout, hi ;h j the portion he did hear convinced him tin lie the President had given considerable tim and attention to public affairs, and was prett well informed on the subjects touched upo and discussed in the message. Representative Findlay said the Preside; 1(e adheres strictly to the principles set forth i ja the Chicago platform of 1884, and is sound o i., the silver question. Mr. Findlay said he w; in unable to hear all of the Ejcecqtive commuu as cation. iv- Representative McComas said the roessaj or was too general respecting the tariff, but al was sound ns to silver coinage and civil se b vice. “It is very long,” said he, “perha; s- because the problems of administration at je new to the President.” at Representative Gibson said he had bee ’,,1 unable to pay strict attention to the readic x- of the message. „ Representative Shaw said so much of it : U he heard sounded thoroughly statesinanlik n- and contained the ideas of a man who ha ly given careful study to the subjects under di cussioii, Maryland Affairs.

A colored youth named Courts shot and killed another colored boy named Brown, aged 16, in a quarrel in Anne Arundel county last Saturday night. The short crops in Frederick county during the present year and the low prices obtaina ble for cereals is causing considerable tight ness in financial circles in Frederick City, i Henry Crusay, a carpenter, at Pikesville, Baltimore county, dropped dead last week while walking along the turnpike at the vil lage. Apoplexy was the cause. He was To i years old, and leaves a wife and two children.

This is an increase of about 1 : i ten tons per day over previous operations. ! Employment is given to a large number of workmen. The company have in contempla ‘ tion the building of a railroad track from the ; furnaces to Mechanicstown, a distance ot several miles, to connect with the Western ( j Maryland Railroad at that point. The convention of the Diocese ol Easton s on Thursday elected Rev. Chauncy C. Wil * liams, of Augusta, Georgia. Rev. Chauncey , C. Williams is about 57 years old. He enter . ed Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., Septem ber 18, 1897, and graduated in July, 1871, not only taking the highest honors of his class, J i but"receiving the prize medals olfered by the college. He afterwards graduated at Berkely Divinity School, Middletown, Conn., under | 1 I Bishop Williams. He then went to Atlanta. | f Ga.. where he assisted Bishop Elliott, now of , Western Texas, and from there to Macon, I where he soon built up a languishing parish. . He is regarded as a “conservative" as distin guished from a “low" churchman. A short time ago Mr. James Sellers, living near Rising Sun, gave employment on his farm to a tramp. On Tuesday evening, dur | ing the absence of Mr. Sellers, the tramp f ! stationed himself behind the door with a club, i and as Mrs. Sellers entered attempted to strike ,1 her over the head with it. She protected s herself with her arms, and, being a large stout i s woman, grappled with her assailant and dis t j armed him. He retreated up stairs threat ening to get the gun and shoot her. . She fol lowed him, grappled with him again, andsuc i. eeeded in ejecting him from the house and j barred the door against him. He went away, ,r threatening to return and burn the premises: but has not. done so yet. 0 John Nash, aged 9 years, son of Joseph •- Nash, residing on the Baltimore county side g of the I’atapseo. near Woodstock, was shot if and, it is thought, fatally wounded by Alex ■- I under Walker, aged 8, with a shotgun tit that 1 place on Tuesday. At the time of the oecur i. rence there were several children in the room n engaged in play, when young Walker picked h up a shotgun, and, upon its being taken away !. from him by young Nash’s sister, seized an e other which was in a corner of the room, and ■- before it could be taken from him it was dis e charged, the whole load lodging in young If Nash’s right arm near the shoulder, almost it ; severing it. Drs. Jas. T. Williams and T. Z. ;• Otfutt were summoned, and the arm, which s. hung only by a small portion of tlesh, was e amputated. Joshua Troup, aged about 45, residing on e the farm of his father, John Troup, four miles west of Hagerstown, committed suicide Tues ■t day morning by shooting himself through the d temple with a large-sized revolver.

A singular case in surgical science is re , • ported from Hillsborough, Carroll county. 1 Wm. E.

The r ’ disease finally reached his brain and unsettled J1 his reason, and he lay for months an imbecile. J " 1 Eminent physicians from Baltimore opened ‘ u j his skull and found a diseased brain, but they f s ! pronounced the case hopeless. Thousands ' e _ 1 of dollars were expended for the merchant’s er j restoration. Meanwhile a local physician, i Dr. Thomas Holt, declared he could effect a j ! cuie by extracting the teeth of the pitiable a sufferer, The eminent medical men did not * agree with him, but after they had abandoned i all hope he was permitted to make his experi i meat. He drew a few of the teeth at a time lc ‘ as the patient’s strength would permit. Bc llr. \ fore all of them were extracted, there was a ?* i preceptible improvement noticed in his con ® i ditiou. Necrosis bad hollowed the teeth and s ; I most of them were filled with matter. Strength l . j was daily gained by Mr. Fleming, and he 115 i showed signs of returning reason. He was s [ i sent to a hospital last week and his friends ” I believe he will come home a well man. d- | Commodore- Charles Lowndes, who was is- i paralyzed at his beautiful residenoo, “The a J Anchorage,” on Miles river, Talbot county, is on the 28th of November, died on Monday i morning, December 14, aged 87.

Malignant scarlet fever has broken out 1 among the pupils of the public at Marion, a western suburb of Jersey City, New Jersey. Five children of Joseph Hanley died of the disease during last week. The outbreak is attributed to the filthy condition of the school. The epizooty has appeared among the horses in Chicago. Fifty horses of one street railway are reported sick, and six have died. A number of teamsters have also suffered through sickness among their horses. The animals have been improving since the weather became cold. The funeral of William H. Vanderbilt took place on Friday of last week, in New A ork. 1 Services were held in St. Bartholomew’s Pro testant Episcopal Church, and the interment took place in the Moravian Cemetery at New Dorp, Staten Island. Everything was simple and unostentatious. The dry goods store of D. AV. Lewis at St. 1 Clair, Penn., was blown up with dynamite at three o’clock on Saturday morning. The out rage is ascribed to liquor agitation, Lewis be ing a prominent member of the Law and Or der Society of St. Clair.

All skating rinks in Madison, Wis‘, are to close indefinitely, under an ordinance of ; Councils passed under a popular pressure that resulted from a succession of scandals and domestic troubles traceable directly to the rinks. Doubling and quadrupling license fees did not accomplish the purpose, and the crusade against the rinks became so great that their extermination was determined upon. A man named Drum was sent to the lowa penitentiary six years ago and has since been a prisoner there, under conviction of having robbed a lightning rod agent in the woods of Bedford, in the same State.

B. Gratz Brown died at St. Louis, Missouri, | ! rather suddenly, on Sunday, aged 59 years. . j He filled important positions in his life time, 1 and played an important part in the politics j of the country. He was once United S ates Senator from Missouri, and afterward led an , 1 independent movement in the Republican ' party in his state in 1870, being elected gov t j ernor by a very large majority. That was i the beginning of the independent movement j j that nominated Horace Greely for President, i and Mr. Brown was selected for Vice-Presi , I dent. The ticket was not successful, but it J made a breach in the Republican party that s j finally ended in its national overthrow. In Lancaster, Penna.. on Saturday, Abo s i Buzzard, Isaac Buzzard, his brother, George . ; Brimmer, John Frankfort, John Lippincott, ; James Clifford, and Alexander Lehman, the y i men who participated in the escapes from s Lancaster county prison in 1882 and 1883, and j better known as the “Buzzard Gang,” were sentenced to fifteen months each in the peni i tentiary for jail-breaking, and were also or -4 dered to serve out their unexpired terms. Lehman was sentenced to the county jail. „ The other prisoners have from four to fifteen . years to serve in the penitentiary. Before y being sentenced, Isaac Buzzard made a state ment that the escapes were effected through e the connivance of the jail officials, who fur e iiished them with impressions of keys an 4 c with acids to eat away the locks; that the j prisoners were in collusion with certain olli ,jp cials as far back as 1881; that it was arranged that on the night that the new keeper, Burk holder, took charge, all the prisoners should g leave; that everything was arranged, but that e Burkholder changed the locks and frustrated i. the attempt. When the escapes occured in ii 1882, the time of midday was fixed by an ofti , cial, who also furnished them with ropes to e sqale the wall. The celebrated ‘bird ca<p’ if escape in 1883. was planned by an official who opened Ike Buzzard’s cell and, leaving the e keys in the door, went to another part of the corridor, where he was followed and irapris ’ oned by the escaping prisoners. Letter from Kansas. [Correspondence of the Democratic Advocate. 1 Avoca, Jackson - County, 1 December 17, 1885. j Messiis. Editors: —Many, many days have passed since your correspondent last, favored your columns with a brief from the “Jay hawker” state, hard work night and day hav ing prevented. But as ho has again assumed his pedagogical campaign, will try and de vote a few hours lo the interest ol Maryland readers. Exceedingly fine weather prevailed up to the 4th inst., when things presented a differ ent aspect. The wind changed to the north west early in the morning, and raged with perfect fury the entire day. On the Bth u light snow fell, and at present the ground 15 adorned with a mantle ol white. The corn crop, of which there is about an average, is well nigh gathered. Ihe wheat, owing to the dry lull, is not looking as well as it should, although there is no complaint of the Hessian fly. Like the ever-shifting sands ol [ho deseit, the writer again finds himself wafted to an other locality. Such is the peculiarity ot his occupation —one that can be reformed to the advantage of all concerned. In this, like all other countries, there is quite a contrast be tween different neighborhoods. M Idle one contains large ranches, with widely scattered residences and immense herds of cattle, an other will contain small farms of a quarter j section and up, with their necessary domestic ! animals, and ornamented by handsome, neat little dwellings, where the proprietors gather j about them their children as a hen gathered] I her brood. The above contrast the writer | finds in bis recent change. On the 3d inst., while a gentle breeze was blowing from the south, a fire was started on the prairie adjoining the east side of the res ervation, midway between its north and south boundary. By the next morning it had kin -1 died a head fire of over two miles in width. At that time, as stated before, the wind chang- I ed to the northwest, and with the hurricane I the work of destruction commenced. It was | only extinguished by coming in contact with | cultivated land, after having consumed every j thing that lay in its way, except several I dwellings that were well fire-guarded. i lie j devastation was confined to about twelve j square miles. About a thousand tons of hay, i with a number of sheds and a great deal ol machinery were destroyed on the Svvlnburi ranche. P. Mclnerney lost all his sheds, hay and machinery, the house and granarj only being saved. ’ Ed. Countryman, James Seeper and a Mr. Berry, employes on the above named ranch, while attempting to back fire around some buildings on the windward side of a barb wire fence, were caught by the flumes and seriously burned. Countryman died the next day: Seeper and Berry at last accounts were convalescing. After having started the tire, the wind in its terrific fury lighted the grass on the opposite side of the break—the side they stood—which compelled them to crawl through the fence. Before they could do this everything was ablaze around them. Thinking they could not kee| out of the way of the fire, Countryman and Seeper attempted to crawl back, all the time being in the blaze. Berry ran a long distance with the very fire at his heels, and was not burned quite as badly as the others. On November Btb a freight train of the U. ! P. Railroad, bound lor Kansas City vvitli about twenty-five carloads ot Colorado cattle, struck a cow near Rossville and was thrown from the track. Upon leaving the track the train separated in three divisions. The middli division on leaving the track was hurled down an embankment, and by its velocity the cars were heaped one upon the other. None o: the train hands were hurt, while the cars ol the above named division were demolished, and a number of the cattle killed or wounded. ; By the assistance of the section men and cit izens, after a delay of from 4 p. in. to 2 a. in., | the train again started tor its destination. I When a steer was taken from the wreck hi would turn upon his rescuers, and theywouk have to flee for refuge. J. F. E. A 

RETRACTION. Westminster, Mu., Dec. 14th, 1885.
