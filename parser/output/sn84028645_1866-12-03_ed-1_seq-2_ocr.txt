' of la the To-Day! To-day the second session of the 30th Congress tonvenes and to-day the Presi dent wilt submit to It his annual message, wherein, in obedience to the mandate of the Constitution, be will "give to the Con gress information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their considera tion such measures as he shall judge nec essary and expedient." Humiliating It Is, that the majority of Congress convenes In a temper and frame of mind that will cause It to pay no heed to the President's recommendation of "such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient" One year ago, In his annual message, written., la language the most courteous and deferential, he called the at' tentloo of Congress to the fact that the .Union bad been maintained by the Feder al arms, so far as It was in the power of military force, to maintain it; that Us maintenance brought with it 'the support of the State Governments in all their rights;" that It had been his "stead fast ob ject to escape from the sway of momenta ry passions, and to devise a healing policy from the fundamental and unchanging principles of the Constitution;" that be had "found the States suffering from the ' effects of civil War ;f that "resistance ' to the General Government appeared to have, exhausted itself;" that "the United States had recovered possession of their forts and srsenalaj and their armies were In the o'cett pa to .. . . . ' i pationoi every state wnicn nau attempted secede;" that whether , the territory within the limits bf those States should be held as conquered territory, under military authority emanating from the Presidents the head of the army, was the first question , that presented Itself for decision." Proper reflection conylnced him that "military governments, established for an indefinite period, would have offered no security for the early suppression of discontent, "would hive divided the people into the vanquish era and the vanquished,, and would have envenomed hatred rather than have restored affection," which "once established, no pre else limit to their continuance wasconcelv able;" that "they would have occasioned an incalculable and exhausting expense;" that "peaceful emigration to and from that por tion of the country is one of the best means that can be thought of for the restoration of harmony, and that emigration ' would have been prevented ; for what emigrant from abroad what industrious citizen , at home would place himself willingly Jin der military rule f that "the chief persons who would have followed in the train of the army would have been dependents on the General Government, or men who ex pected profit from the miseries of their er ring fellow-citizens;" that, "besides, the policy of military rule over a conquered territory would have implied that the States whose Inhabitants may have taken part In the rebellion had, by the act of those In habitants, ceased to exist;" that he had "gradually and quietly, by almost imper ceptible steps, sought to restore the right ful energy of the General Government of the States. . To that end provisional Gov ernors had been appointed for the States, Conventions called, Governors elected, Leg islatures assembled, and Senators and Rep resentatlves chosen to the Congress of the United States." He knew that "this policy" was "attend ed with some risk ;" that for Its success It required at least the concurrence of the States which it concerned ; that It Implied "an invitation to those States, by renewing their allegiance to the United States, to re. sume their functions as States in , the Union." To the end that the "risk" should not be an unfortunate one, he had felt it in. eumbent on blm to exercise one other pow er confided to blm by the "General Govern ment the power of pardon;" that "as no State can throw a defense over the crime of treason, the power of pardon Is exclusively TMted h Executive Government of the l-niiea oiaies." iuo next siep ue ok 'to! restore the ConsUtutional relations of the States was to Invite "them fi r Ffilna tai In rliA rtl rrfi rifflnl nt minl I to participate In the high office of amend ing the Constitution, In so far as it provided for the total and continual abolition of sla very," and he thought In return for the adoption ot this amendment " a general amnesty" should be exchanged. He had cherished the belief that "the adoption of the amendment" would reunite "us all be yond all power of disruption." After the adoption of this amendment only one thing more. In his judgment, was needed to "completely the work of restoration," and wU for Mtho gtateg) whose powert have been so long in abeyance, to resume their places in the two branches of the Na tional Legislature." . Instead of the last Congress regarding what the President had sq well done In the grand work of restoration, they treated It with contempt and spat upon It. They pre- vented complete restoration by denying "the States, whose powers had been so long in abeyance, to resume their place in the two branches of the National Legisla ture." . And to-day Congress meets ani mated by a determination to indefinitely put off the completion of restoration. The line of policy the President pursued has worked marvelously well. While it might have been looked upon one year ago doubtfully, to-day Its wisdom must stand confessed. The President's risk "bis putting to one. side the idea of ruling the South by the military arm, or through a territorial conditionbas resulted most fortunately for the good of the country. Had Congress united with the President one year ago In taking the " risk " to finijr up restoration by allowing the Southern States to resume their constitutional right representation, to-day the country would be in a far better condition than it Is, There would not be In business that depres sion that there now is. If Congress and the President shall not start out to-day with a, determination of finishing up the work of restoration without any more ado without insisting upon the adoption any more amendments to the Constitu tlon the probabilities are that distress In business will Increase Instead of diminish. To-day, therefore, every Interest In the country demands that the Southern States should be permitted Immediately to resume their co-equality in the Union. to It The publication or tue nrhip poorvillL t very creditable little monthly, published In this city by Masters VVilsos L.

The following "rules of the road" are based upon legal decisions, and ought to be universally known: The courts have decided that applicants for tickets on rail roads can be ejected from the cars If they do not offer the exact amount of their fare. Conductors are not bound to make change All railroad tickets are good nntil used, conditions "good lor this day only," or other admitting time of genuinenessv are of no account. Passengers who lose their tickets. can be ejected from the cars unless they purchase a second one. "Passengers are bound to observe decorum In the cars, and are obliged to comply with all reason able demands to show their tickets. Stand Ing on the platforms or otherwise violating the rules of the company renders a person liable to be put from the train, No person has a right to monopolize more seats than he has paid for; and any article left in the teat while the owner is temporarily absent, entitles him to his seat on bis return. Masonic Fraternity—An Act of Justice. At the sacking and burning of the city of Atlanta, Georgia, after it had fallen into the hands of Sherman's victorious army, the Masonic LodgeNo. 69 was entered by some of our soldiers, and the Bible and jewels belonging to the Lodge Were taken away. The Bible feu Into the hands of a soldier who was not a Mason, and was sent by' him to Mr. W. S. Newman, of Toledo Lodge, No. 144. Mr. Newman presented It the Grand Lodge of the State of Ohio, with a request that it be returned to the Atlanta Lodge. We saw the Bible yes terday, in the hands of Thomas Sparrow, Esq., Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of the State of Ohio, who was about sending by Adams Express, to Mr. John Harris Master of Atlanta Lodge, by whom it will returned to the sacred keeping of Its original owners. This is but a simple act j ustlce ; yet It shows the fraternal feeling which exists among the members of the mystic tic.

SIXTH NIGHT. ! : ' ' The Fair for the benefit of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, was well attended on Saturday night, and everything appears to ludicate a very successful termination The Plaho auction sale did not come off, but It will be offered to-night, when It Is confidently expected that the . Hall will be crowded. The ladies connected with this enterprise have shown a zeal In the competition' for patronage which Is com , mendable, and we sincerely hope that they maT meet with the success which thev so richly deserve. The fesent Indications are that the Fair will close on to-morrow evening, at which , time it is expected the articles remaining on hand will be disposed of at auction Opera House. ' The announcement of a benefit for Man. ager Raymond at the Opera House on Sat urday night, drew a large and fashionable audience but the severe Indisposition of Miss M. E. Gordon caused a change to be made lu the programme, and "Camiile" was substituted for the play entitled "Nan cy Sykes." Although not anticipating ft change, Miss Western, and in fact every member of the company, were well pre pared to render their different characters in most admirable style. Mr. Raymond takes his company, including Miss Lucille Western, to Chicago, to play an engage ment in Crosby's Opera House. - We hope Mr. Raymond will meet with success In the great city of the West.
