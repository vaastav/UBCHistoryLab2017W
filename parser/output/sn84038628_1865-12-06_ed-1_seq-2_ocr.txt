DAILY ARiiUS. Wednesflsy ETenlng Dec. 6. PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S MESSAGE. The first annual message, of President Andrew Johnson, to be found in these columns, will be read with great interest by all the people. The two principal and most Important topica discuss ed are, the reorganization of the states, and the finaoces of the country, in both of which, we are happy to say, he firmly and vigorously maintains the doctrineaof the old democratic party. Oa a careful perusal of the message we find no word or line to censure, and we trust that the patriotic views set forth by the president will be sustained by congress and the people. 

MESSAGE or THE PRESIDENT OF THE CXITED STATES TO THE Two Houses of Congress at the Com mencement of the First ses sion of the Thirtj ninth Congress, Fellow-citixena of the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: To express gratitude to God. in the name of the people, tor tne preset vation of the Uu; ted States, is my first duty in addressing you. Oar thoughts next revert to the death of the late president by an act of parricidal treason. The grief of the nation is full fresh ; it fiads some eolace in the considera tion that he lived to enjoy the highest proot ot its confidence by entering on the renewed term of the chief magistracy, to which he had been elected ; that he brought the civil rar sabitantiallv to a close ; taat his loss was deplored ia all parts of the Union ; and that foreign nations have rendered justice to : preum authority ot the constitution of the his memory, liis removal cast upon me a ' United States. The perpetuity of tue c .nsti heavier weight of cares than ever devolved tution brings with it the perpetui y of the upon any ona of his predecessors, lo fultill j states ; their mutual relation makes us what my trust I need the support and confidence j we are, and ia our political system tueir con of all who are associated with me in the var- j nexion is indissoluble. The whole cannot ious departments of government, aud the exist without the parts, nor the parts without support and confidence of the people. There j the whule. S long as the constitution of the is but one way in which I can hope to gain . Unite i States eudures, the states will endure; their necessary aid : it is.to state with frank- j ness the principles which guide iny coadopt, ; and their application to the present state of : affairs, well aware that the elSsiency of my j labors will, in a great measure, depend ou j your and their undivided approbation. ! The Union of the United Spates of Ameri- j ca was intended by its authors to last as long j as the states themselves shall la-t. 'The j Ujuox shall bi perpetcal" are the words i of the confederation. "To roan a more per- j fect U.vios," by an ordinance of the people i of ttie United States, is the declared purpose i ot tne constitution, xae nana ot jJivme Providence was never more plainly visible ia the affairs of men than in the framing and the adopting of that instrument, ft is, be yond comparison, the greatest event in Am erican history ; and indoed is it r.ot, of all events in modern times, the most pregnant with consequences for every people of tbe earth? Ttie members of the convention whisa prepared it, brought tj their work the i experience of the confederation, ot their eev- eral etar.es, and of other republican goveru- : menu, oil and new ; but they needed and they obtained a wisdom superior to exper- lence. Ana wnen lor its validity is required ; the approval of a people that occupied a large part of a continent and acted separate ly in mny distinct conventions, vtiit ia more wonderful than that, after earnest con tention and long discussion, all feelings aud all opinions were ultimately drawn in one way to its support ? The constitution to which life was thus iaparud contains withiu itself ample re sources for its own preservation. It has power to enforce the laws, puuish treasou, aod ensure domestic tranquillity. In cae of tbe usurpation of the giverninaut of a state by one man, or an oligarchy, it be comes a duty ot the United States to iu ike good the guarantee to that state of a repuoli- ! can form of government, iind s to maintain ' train of the army would have been depend the htimogeneousness of all. D es the lapse i ents on the gen-ral government, or men who of time roveal defects? A simple mode of ; expected profit from rhe miseries of their er- atnendmsnt is provided in the constitution : itself, so that its conditions can always be made to c inform to the require uents ot al vaocing civilization. No room is all j wed even for the thought of a possibility of its co uing to an end. And tnese powers of self preservation have always been asserted in their complete integrity by every patriotic chief magistrate by Jefferson and Jackson, not less than by Washington and Madison. The parting advice of tbe father of his coun try, while yet president, to the people of the United States, was, that "tbe free constitu tion, which was the work of tbeir hands, might be sacredly maintaiued ;" and tbe in augural words of President Jefferson held up "the perservation of the general government, in its c institutional vigor, as the sheet an chor of our peace at home and safety abroad." The c institution is the work of "the pepple of tbe United States," and it should bs as indestructible as the peo ple. Jt is not strings that the fratners of the constitution, which bad no model in the past, should not have fully comprehended the ex cellence of their own work. Fresh from a struggle against arbitrary power, many pa triots suffered from barrasing fears of an absorption of the state governments by the general government, and many from a dread that the states would break away from their orbits. But the very greatness of our coun. try should allay the apprehension of en croachments by the general government. The subjects that came unquestionably with in its jurisdiction are so numerous, that it must ever naturally refuse to be embarrassed by questions that lie beyond it. Were it otherwise, the executive would sink beneath the burden , the channels of justice would be choked ; legislation would be obstructed by excess ; so that there is a greater temptation to exercise some of the functions of the gen eral government through tho states than to trespass on their rightful sphere. "The ab solute acquieserjee ia the dicisions of the ma jority" was, at the beginning of the century, enforced by Jefferson "as the vital principle of republics," and tbe events of the last four years have established, we will hope forever, that there lies no appeal to fof ce. The maintenance of the Union brings with it "the support of the state gouernments in all their rights ;" but it is not one of the fights of any state povernmeat to renounce own plnce m tbe Uuion. or to nullify tbe Vws oi tbe Union. The lareeat lihrr i. i,- Maintained in the discussion of the aot of the eralovernmenf; but there, i. appeal of that government itself, or to the people, j woo grant to tne members ot the legislative and of tbe executive department! no tenure bat a limited one, and in that manner always retain the powers of redress. ' The sovereignty of the States," is the language os the Confederacy, and not the language of tbe Constitution. The latter contains the emphatic words : "The Consti tution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the coutrary notwithstanding." Certainly the government of the United States is a limited government; and so is every state government a limited govern ment. With us, this idea of limitation spreads through every form of administration, general, state and municipal, and rests on tbe great distinguishing principle of the re cognition of the rights of man. The ancient republics absorbed tbe individual in the state, prescribed his religion, and controlled his activity. The American system rests on the assertion of the equal right of every man to life, liberty and the pursuit ot happiness ; to freedoui ot conscience, to the oulturo and exercise of all his faculties. Asa oonee queries, the state government is limited, as 1 1 the general government in the interest of Union, as to the individual citixen in the int erest of freedom. Scales, with proper limitations of power, are essential to tbe existence of the constitu tion of the United States. At the very com mencement, when we assumed a place among the powers of the earth, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by states; so also were the article- of defederation ; and when "the People of tbe United States" ordained and established the constitution, it was tbe assent of tue states, one by one, which gave it vitality. Ia the event, too, of any amend ment to the constitution, the proposition of congress needs the confirmation of states. Without states, one great branch of the leg islative government would be wautiog. And, if we look beyond the letter of the constitu tion to the character of our country , in ca pacity for comprehending within it! jurisdic tion a vast continental empire is due to the system of elates. The best security for the perpetual existence ot the states is the 'su- the destruction of the one is the destruction of the other ; ihe preservation of tha om is the preservation of the other, I have thus explained my views of the mutual relations of tiie coustitutiou aud the states, because they unfold the principles on which I have sou zht to solve the momentous questions a: oulties that tud overcome tbe appallinc diffi- met roe at the very coracneai:n- cnent of my administration. It has beeu my steadla-u obitct to escape from the sway of momentary passions, and to derive a healing policy from the fundamental and unchanging principles of the constitution. I found the state- suffering froai the effects of a civil war. Hesistauce to the general government appeared to have exhausted it self. Tha United States had recovered pos session ot their torts and arsenals ; and their armies were in the occupation of everv state ; which hid attempted to secede. Whether I the territory within the limits of those stales should be held as cmquered territory, under military authority AuiitnatiDg from tbe presi dent as the head of the army, was the first question that presented itselt for decision, Now, military governments, established lor an luaenuua perioj, wiuu nave onere! no security for th ) early suppressiou of dis content; would have divided the people into the vanquishers and tiie vanquished; and wouM have envenomed hatred, rather than have restored a'Jec.ion. Oace established, no precise limit to their continuance was con ceivable. Ttiey would have occasioned an inctlculabte and exhaustive expeoe Peace ful etnigr ttiun to a;. J f rom that portion of the country is one of tbe best m-ans that can be thought of fr the restoration of harmony ; aud that emigration would have been pre vented; for wnat emigrant from abroad, what industrious citizen at home, would place hnu-elt willingly under military rule? Ihe chief persons who wjuli have followed in tbe riuz t-ilow citizens, ine powers ot patruo- ae ana rule wtiien wouia nave oeen exer cised, under th president, over a vast aod pepulous, nd naturally wealthy region, are greater thai;, unless under extreme necessity, I should be willing to entrust to any one man ; they are such as, for myself, I "could never, unless on occasions of great emergen cy, couaeut to exercise. Trie wilful use of such powers, if continued through a period ol ye-irs, would hve" endangered the purity of the general administration and the liber ties of tbe states which remained loyal. Besides, the policy of military rule over a conquered territory would have implied that tbe states whose inhabitants may have taken part in the rebellion had, by tbe act of those inhabitants, ceased to exist But the true theory is, that all pretended acts of secession were, from the beginning, null and void. The states cannot commit treasou, nor screen the individual citizens who may have com mitted treason, any more than they can make Valid treaties to engage in lawful commerce with any foreign power. Tbe states attempt iug to secede placed themselves in a condi tion where their vitality was impaired, but not extinguished their functions suspended, but cot destroyed. But if any slate neglects or refuses to per form its offices, there is the more need that the general government should maintain all its authority, and, as soou as practicable, re sume tbe exercise of all its functions. Oa this principle 1 have acted, and have gradu ally and quietly, and by almost impercepti ble steps, sought to restore the rightful en ergy of the general government and of the states. To that end, provisional governors have been appointed for the states, conven tions called, governors elected, legislatures assembled, and senators and representatives chosen to the senate of the United States. At the same time, the courts of the United States, as far as could be done, have been re opened, so 'bat tbe laws of tbe United States may be enioiced through tbeir agency. The blockade has been removed and the custom houses re established in ports of entry, so that the revenue of the United States may be collected. Tbe post office department renews its ceaseless activity, aod the general gov eminent is thereby enabled to communicate promptly with its officers and agents. Tbe courts bring seourity to persons and proper ty ; the opening of the ports invites the res toration ot industry and commerce; the post office renews the facilities of sooial inter course and of business. And is it not happy for us all, that the restoration of each one of brings with it a blessing to the states over which they are extended ? Is it not a sure promise of harmony and renewed attachment to the Union that, after all that has happen ed, the return of the general government is known only as a beneficenoe? I know very well that this policy is attend ed with some risk ; that for its success it re quires at least the acquiescence of the states which it concerns ; that !t implies an invita tion to those states, by renewing tbeir alle giance to the United States, to resume their funotions as states of the Union. But it is a risk that must be taken ; in the choice of difficulties, it is the smallest risk ; and to diminish, and. if possible, to remove all dan ger, I have felt it incumbent on me to assert one other power of tbe general government the power of pardon. As no state can throw a defense over the crime of treason, the pow er of pardon is exclusively vested in the exe cutive government of the 'Uoited States In exercising that power, I have taken every precaution to connect it with the clearest recognition of tbe binding force of the laws of the United States, and an unqualified ac knowledgement of tho great social change of cooauion in regara to slavery wnicu baa grown out of the war. The step which I have taken to restore tbe constitutional relations of the states has been an invitation to them to participate in the high office of amending the constitution. Ev ery patriot must wish for a general amnesty at the earliest epoch consistent with public safety. For this great end there is need of a concurrence of all opinions, and the spirit of mutual conciliation. All parties in the late terrible conflict must work together in har mony. It is not too much to ak. ia tbe name of the whole people, that, on the one side, the plan of restoration shall proceed in conformity with a willingness to oast the die orders of the past into oblivion ; and that, on tbe other, the evidence of sincerity in the fu ture maintainaucs oi tne Union snail be put beyond any doubt by the ratification of tbe proposed amendment to the constitution. which provides for tbe abolition of slavery forever within the limits of our country. So long as tbe adoption of this amendment is de layed, so long will doubt, aud jealousy, and uncertainty prevail. This is tbe measure which will efface tbe sad memory of the past; this is tbe measure which will most certainly call population, and ctpital, and security to those parts ot tbe Lnion that need them most. Indeed, it not too much to ak of the states which are now resuming their places in the family of the Union to give this pledge of perpetual loyalty aud pa;e. I'ctil it is done, tbe past, however much we may desire it, will not be lorn-men. The adoption of the amendment reunites beyond ull power of disruption. It hea.s the wound that is iu!i imperfectly closed ; it removes slavery, the elaoient which has so long perplexed aod di vided the country ; it luiuen f us once more a united people, renewed and strengthened, bound more than ever to mutual affection and support. The ameudui-nt to the constitution being alopted.it would remain for the btatcs,whose powers have beeu so long in abeyance, to re sume tbeir place- iu the two bruooes of the national legislature, and thereby complete the work of restoration. Here it is for you, fellow- citizens of the senate, and tor you, fet citizens ot the h use of representatives, to judge, each of you for yourselves, nf tbe e!eo tioos, returns and qualifications ot your own members. The full assertion of the powers of the gen eral government require the holding r-f cir cuit courts of the United States within the districts where their aullwritv ha 1 been in terrupted. In the present pjoture of our public affairs, strong objections hive been urged to holding those courts in any of the t:es vhre thn rebellion had existed ; and it was ascertained, by inquiry, that the cir cuit court of the United Slates would not be held within the district of Virginia during the autumn or early winter, nor until ccn gres should have "an opportunity to consid er and act on the whole subje;t " To your deliberations the restoration of this branch ot .be civil authority of the United States is therefore necessarily referred, with the hope that early provision will be made for the re su'upti a of ail its functions. It is mani fest that treason, most Hsgrant in character, has been committed. Persons who are charg ed with its commissien should have fair and impartial trials ia the highest civil tribunals of the country, in order that the constitution and the laws may be fully vindicated ; the truth clearly established and affirmed, that treason is a crime, that traitors should be punished, and the offeuse made infamous : and. at the sume time, that the question may be juiicially settled, finally and forever, that no state of its own will has the ri-ht to re nounce its pUce iu the Uoi m. The relations of the general government towards tbe four millions of inhabitants whom the war has ca'.Ied into freedom, have enga.red my most serious consideration. On the propriety of attempting to make tbe freed men electors by the proclamation of the exec utivs, I took for ray counsel the constitution itself, the interpretations of that instrument by its authors aud their contemporaries, mnd recent legislation by congress. When, is the first movement towards independence, tbe congress of the United States instructed the several states to institute governments of their own, they left each state to deoide for i self the conditions fjr the employment of the elective franchise. During the period of the contederacy, there continued ti exist a very great diversity in the qualification ol electors in tbe several states ; and even with in a stato a distinction of qoaliScatio is pre vailed with regard to the oibcers wl,u were to be ehoeon. The constitution ot the United States recognizes thri-e diversities when it en joins that, ia the choice o! member of the house of representatives ol the United States, "the electors in each st-ite shall have the qualifications requisite fr electors of the most numerous braucu ot the s'ate legisla ture " After the formation of the constitu tion, it remained, as before, the uniform usage for each state to enlarge the body of its electors, accordiug to its own judgement ; and, m.der this system, one state after an other has procee lei to increase the number of its electors, until now universal suffrage, or something very near it. is the eeneral rule. So CxeJ was this reservation of power in the habits of tbe people, and so unques tioned has been the interpretation of tbe con stitution, that during the civil war the late president never harbored the purpose cer tainly never avowed the purpose of disre garding it ; and in tbe acts of congress, dur ing that period, nothing can be found which, during tha continuance of hostilities, much less after tbeir close, would hsvi sanctioned any departure by the executive from a policy which has so unit rmly obtained. Moreover, a concession of tbe elective franchise to the freedmen, by the act of the president of tbe United States, roust have been extended t all colored men, wherever found, and so must have established a change of suffrage in the northern, middle and western states, not less than in the southern and southwestern Such an act would have created a new elaa of voters, and would have been an assumption ot power by tbe president which nothing in tbe eonstitotioi or laws of the United States -" ' J On the other hand, every danger of con- fliot is avoided when the settlement of the question is referred to the several states. They can, eacn tor itselt, decide on tne meas ure, and whether it is to be adopted at once and absolutely, or introduced gradually mnd ith conditions. In my judgement tlie freedmen, if they show patience and manly virtues, will sooner obtain a participation in the elective franchise through the states than through the general government, even if it had power to intervene. When the tu mult of emotions that have been raised by the suddenness of the social change shall have subsided, it may prove that they will re ceive the kindliest usage from some of those on whom they have hereto ore most closely depended. But while I have no doubt that now, after the close of the war, it is not competent for the general government to extend the elect ive franchise in the several states.it is equal ly clear that good faith requires the securi ty of the freedmen in their liberty and tbeir property their right to labor, and tbeir right to claim tbe just re:urn ot tbeir labor. 1 can not too .strongly urge a dispassionate treat ment of this subject, which should bs careful ly kept aloof from all party strife. We must equally avoid hasty assumptions of any nat ural impossibility tor tbe two races to live side by side, in a state of mutual benefit and good will. Tbe experiment involves us in no inconsistency ; let as then go on and make that experiment in good faith, and not bs too easily disheartened. The country is in need of labor, and the freedmeu are iu need of em ployment, culture and protection. While their right ot voluntary migration and expa triation is not to be questioned, I would not advise tbeir forced removal and colonization. Let us rather encourage them to honorable and useful industry, wbere it may be benefi cial to themselves and to the country; and, instead of hasty anticipation of the certainty of failure, let there be nothing wanting to the fair trial of the experiment. The change in their condition is the substitution of labor by contract for the status of slavery. The freed men cannot fairly be accused of unwilling ness to work, so long as a doubt remains about his fresdom of choice in his pursuits, and the certainty of recovering his stipulated wages. In this the interests tf the employer and the employed coincide. The employer desires iu bis workmen spirit and alacrity, and these can be permanently secured in no other way. And if the one ought to be abK to enforce the contract, so ouht tbe other. The public interest wiil be best promoted, if the several states will pro. Me aJequate pro tection and remedies f ir the freedmen. Un til this is in some way accomplished, there is no chance for tho advantageous uso of their labor ; aud the blame of ill success will not rest ou them. 1 know that sincere philanthropy i- earnest for tbe immediate realization if their remo test aims ; but time is always an clement in reform. It is one of the greatest acts .n rec ord to have brought four millions ot" people into freedom. Tue career of freo industry must Le tsitly opened to them ; aud then their future prosperity and condition must, after all, rest mainly on thernselve. If they tail, uud so perish away, let us be careful that the failure shail not ba attributable to cay denial of justic -. Ia ail that relates to the destiny of the freedmeu, we i:eed not be too anxious to read the iuture; many inci dents which. from n speculative point of view, might raise alarm, will quietly settle them selves. Xj that slavery is at an end or iier its enl, the greatness ot its evil, in the point of view of publio economy, becomes m..re and more apparent. Slavery was essentially a mouop.lv of lab .r, and a- s:ic!i loclie-d the states wbere it prev ailed ucainst the incom ing of free indutry. here Ubor was the property of the capi uh?t. tho white m.-.a was excluded from employment, or had out the second best chatice vf rinding it; asd the for eign emigrant turtle J away lrom the region waere his condition would be so precarious. With the destruction of the monopoly, free labor will hasten from all parts of the civil ized world to assist in developing various and immeasurable resources which have hitherto lain dormant The eight or nir.e states near est tbe Guif of Mexico have a soil of exhu berant fertility, a climate friendly to long life. and can eustaiu a deuser population than is tound as yet in any part of our county And tbe future influx ot population to them wiil bs mainly fro.u the north, or from tbe most civi.ized nations in Europe. From the sufferings that have attended them during our late struggle, let us look away to the fu ture, which is sure to be laden for tlitin with greater prosperity than has ever before breu known. Tbe removal of the monopoly of slave labor is a pie Jge that tuose regions will be peopled by a numerous and enterpriaiug popuUtion, which will vie with any in the Union iu c tnpactrsess, inventive geuius, wetltb, and industry. Our government springs from and was made for the people not the people for tbe government. To them it owes allegiance ; lro u them it must derive its courage strength and wisdom. But. while the government is thus bound todef-rt the people, from whom it derives its exigence, it should, from the very conideration of its origin, be strong in i'.a power of resistence to tbe establishment of inequalities. M oopoliee, perpetuties, and class legislation, are contrary to tbe genius jf free government. and ought not to be allowed. Here, there is no room for ftvore i classes or monopolies, the priuciple of our government is tbat of equal laws and freed -.in of indus try. Wherever mou poly attains a tooth M. it is sure to be a source of danger, discord and trouble. We shall but fulfill our duties as legislators by according "equal and exact justice to all tneu'specisl privileges to none. The government is subordinate to tbe people; but, as the agent ami representative of tbe people.it must be held superior to monopolies, which. iu the usel ves.ougbt never to be grant ed, aod which, where they exist, must lie subordinate and yield to the governtnont. The constitution confers ou congress the right to regulate commerce among the several states. It is of the first necessity, for tLe nisintainaccs of the Union, tbat tbat com-' merce should be free and unolietrueted. No stste can be justified in any device to tax the transit of travel and commerce between states. The position of many states is such tbat, if they were allowed ti take advantage of it for purposes of local revenue, the com merce between states might be injuriously burdened, or even virtually prohibited. It is beht, while tbe country is still young, and while the t ndency to dangerous monopolies of this kind is still feeble, to use the power of congress so as to pieveot any selfish impe diment to the free circulation of men and merchandise. A tax on travel and merchan dise, in tbeir transit, constitutes one of the worst forms of monopoly, and the evil is in creased if coupled with a denial of the choice of route, When tbe vast extent of our coun try is c meidered, it is plain tbat every obsta cle to the free circulation of commerce be tween the states ought to be sternly guarded agsinst by appropriste legisIation,witbin the limits of the constitution. Tbe report of tbe secretary of the inUrior explains the condition of tbe public lands.tbe transactions of the patent office the pension ynrmaJLAbm. nnimn( pf pity Jntian j the progress made in the Construction of the Facihc railroad, and furnishes information in reference to matters of local interest ia the District of Columbia. It also presents evi dence of the successful operation of the home stead act, under the provisions of which 1.160,613 acres of the publio land was enter ed during the fiscal year more than one fourth of the whole number of acres sold or otherwise disposed of during that period. It is estimated tbat the receipts derived from this source are sufficient to cover the expen ses incident to the survey and disposal of the lands entered under this act, and that pay ments in cash to the extent of from forty to fifty per cent will be made by settlers, who may thus at any time acauire title before the expiration of the period at which it would oth erwise vesJ. The homestead policy was es tablished only after long and earnest resist ance; experience proves its wisdom. The lands, in the hands vf industrious settlers, whose labor creates wealth and contributes to the publio resources, are w rth more to the United States than if they had been reserved as a solitude tor luture purchasers. The lamentable events of the last four years, and the sacrifices made by tha gallant men ot our army and navy, have swelled the records of tbe pension bureau t-o au unpre cedented extrnt. On the 30th day of June last, tbe total t. umber of pensioners wts njc. :.: r.-.i,: i - I -oo, rciiuiiiiiK ur tucir itiiuum iKiy.e&t.-iulvO number ot applications tout have beeu allow ed sinus that date will require a large in crease of this amount for the next fiscal year. Tbe means for the piymcnr of the stipends due, under existing laws, to our disabled sol diers and sailors, and to the families of such as have perished in the servic of the country, will no doubt be cheerfully and promptly granted. A grateful people will not hesitate to sanction any measures having for their ob ject the relief of soldiers mutilated and fami lies made iatberless iu tbe efforts t preserve our national existence. j The report of the postmaster general pre- i sents an encouraging exhibit ot the opera- 1 tions of the post office department during the 1 year. The revenues ot the past year from ' the loyal state alone exceeded tho maximum ' annual receipts from ail the states previous i to the rebellion, in ti.e sum uf 'J.t.'8. tJl : ' the annual revenue .luring tue last four years, compare.! witb tbe revenues t the lour years iminuiediatciy proceeding the re bellion, was .Soo,!- Tbe revenues of tbe last fiscal year amounted to ld.ooG.l-oH, and the expenditures to $13,G'J1.7lI. leaving a surplus of receipts over expenditures of i 56 1,420. Progress bus been made in restor ing tbe postal service in the southern elites. Tbe views presented by the postmaster gen eral against the policy ol granting subsidies to ocean mail steamship lines upon establish ed routes,and in fav. r of continuing the pres ent system, which limits the co.-npeusation for ocean service to the portage earnings, are recommended to the careful consideration of Congress. It appears fro-o the report of the secretary of the navy, that whiie, at the commencement of the present year, there were in commission o30 vessels of all classes and discriptiotis armed with 3.000 guns and manned by 51, 000 men. the number of vessels at present in commission is 117, with 830 guns and 12.128 men. By the prompt reduction of the navi.1 force the expenses of the govercmer.: have been largely diminished, and a number of vessels, purchased, for naval purposes from the merchant marine, have been returned to the peacelul pursuits d commerce. Since the I suppression f active hostilities our f rein ! souadrnns have been re cstah'.ishod, and c n- I si its of vessel- much more efficient than tboe employed on similar service previous to the rebellion. The suggestion for the enlarge- i mfti f the navy yards and e-peciallv for the j establishment of one in fresh water f ir iron j c!al ves-eis, is deservsng of consi icr.ttiou, ts I is also the recommendation for a different lo- cation aud more ample grounds for the naval J academy. i Concluded in our next.

SPELXH OF MK. COLFAX. ! j Mr. Speaker Colfax, after being conduoted ' j t the chair, addressed tbe house as follows : Gektlchck or tut House or REr-arsEKTATivct The reassembling f congress marking, as it does, the progress ot our national history is al ways regarded with interest by the people tor j whom it is to legislate ; but it is not unsafe to say j that millions more than ever before north, south, I east and west are looking to the congress which j opens its 6rst session to-day with an earnestness i and solicitude onequaled on similar occasions in the past. The 3.n congress closed Us constitu tional existence with the storm-cloud ot war stilt hovering over it, and, alter a nine month's ab sence, congress renames its legislative authority n these council halls, rejoicing that lrom shore to shore in our isnd thero is peai e. lis duties are as ubvious as the auc's patbway ia the heavens. Representing i: as to biancbes the slates and the people, its first and Ligbest obligation is to guarantee to every stale a republican form ot government. The rebellion having overthrown ir.r roislitulinnar slit governments in many stales, it is tour duty to matuie and enaet legislation which, with tbe concurrence of such a stste of enduriLg j uatire as st ill guarantee all necessary safe-fuards lo the people, will aflord what our magna charts, the declaration f independence, proclaims the chief object of government : protection to all men ia their inalienable rights Applause. The world should tkitneis, in this great or , the most indel ible fidelity, the mast earnest devotion to the pria cip.es ol liberty and; humanity the truest patriot ism and tbe wisest slat smanship.
