"3- 2 l| -f f! II I" h&k> m* W 4jt,t i. .' Washington, Dec. 17.—The president today sent to congress the following special message on the Panama canal: To the Senate and House of Repre­ sentatives In the month of November I visited the isthmus of Panama, going over the canal zone with considerable care and also visited the cities of Panama and Colon, which are not in the zone or under the United States flag, bat as to which the United States govern­ ment, through its agents, exercises control for certain sanitary purposes. I was three days ashore—not a suffi­ cient length of time to allow of an exhaustive investigation of the iment pearl minu­ tiae cf the work of any single depart­ ment, still less to pass judgment on the engineering problems, but enough to enable me to get a clear idea of the salient features of the great work and of the progress that has been made as regards the sanitation of the zone, Colon and Panama, the caring for and housing of the employes and the actual digging of the canal. The zone is a narrow strip of land and it can be in­ spected much as one can inspect fifty or: sixty miles of a great railroad at the pcint where it runs through moun­ tains or overcomes other natural ob­ stacles. The president then details the pro­ gramme he carried out during his stay on the canal zone. He says it rained almost continually during that time and that conditions were at their jworst when inspected. Continuing, the says: At the outset I wish to pay a tribute the amount of work done by the French Canal company under very ^difficult circumstances. Many of the Ibuildings they put up were excellent land are still in use, though, naturally, jtlLe houses are now getting out of re­ pair and are being used as dwellings tally until other houses can be built, and much, of the work they did in the lebra cut. and some of the work did in digging, haB been of direct lid real benefit. This country has aver made a better investment than le $40,000,000 which it paid to the rench company for work and better its, including especially the Pan kma railroad. Preliminary Work Being Done. The wisdom of the canal manage has been shown in nothing more rly than in the way in which the foundations of the work have been paid. To have yielded to the natural impatience of ill informed outsiders and begun all kinds of experiments in fcfork prior to a thorough sanitation of Isthmus, and to a fairly satisfac working out of the problem of and keeping a sufficient labor •supply, would have been disastrous. rThe various preliminary measures had rto be taken first and these could not She taken so as to allow us to begin tthe real work of construction prior to Jan. 1 of the present year. It then be «ame necessary to have the type of Ithe canal decided and the only delay been the necessary delay until the day of June, the date when the Icongress definitely and wisely settled Ithat we should have an 85-foot level icanal. jmmediately after that the rwork began in hard earnest and has Ibeen continued with increasing vigor ever since and it will continue so to progress in the future. When the con­ tracts are let the conditions will be such as to insure a constantly increas .ing amount of performance. •has I |28th Wnn Successful Sanitation. The first great problem to be polved, upon the solution of which the success of the rest of the work depended, was he problem of sanitation. This was Irom the outset under the direction of Dr. W. C. Gorgas, who is to be made a full member of the commission. It must be remembered that his work was not mere sanitation, as the term is understood in our ordinary munic­ ipal work. Throughout the zone and in the two cities of Panama and Colon, In addition to the sanitation work proper, he has had to do all the work that the marine hospital service does isg regards the nation, that the health 'department officers do in the various states and cities and that Colonel Waring did in New York when he cleaned its streets. The results have been astounding. The isthmus had been a byword for deadly unhealtbful- Now, after two years of our occupation, the conditions as regards sickness and the death rate compare favorably with reasonably healthy lo­ calities In the United States. Espe- ... and yellow fevers. Equal care is taken men and 'black men are treated exact­ ly alike and their treatment is as good as that which could be obtained in our first class hospitals at home. All the patients that I saw, with one or two exceptions, were laborers or other employes on the canal works and rail­ ways, most of them being colored men of the ordinary laborer stamp. Not only are the men carefully cared for whenever they apply for care, but so far as practicable a watch is kept to see that if they need it they are sent to the hospitals, whether they desire to go or not.- From no responsible source did any complaSit come to me as to the management of the hospital service, although occasionally a very ignorant West India negro when he is first brought into the hospital becomes frightened by the ordinary hospital routine. Health Showing Remarkable. Just at present the health showing on the isthmus is remarkably good— so much better than in most sections of the United States that I do not be­ lieve that it can possibly continue at quite its present average. Thus, early in the present year a band of several hundred Spaniards were brought to the isthmus as laborers and additions to their number have been made from time to time yet since their arrival in February last but one of those Span­ iards thus brought over to work on the canal has died of disease, and he of typhoid fever. Two others were killed, one in a railroad accident and one by a dynamite explosion. There «g been for the last six months a well nigh steady decline in the death rate for the population of the zone, this being largely due to the decrease in deaths from pneumonia, which has been the most fatal disease on the isthmus. In October there were ninety nine deaths of every kind among the employes of the isthmus. There were then on the rolls 5,500 whites, seven eights of them being Americans. Of these whites but two died of disease and as it happened neither man was an American. Of the 6,000 white Amer­ icans, including some 1,200 women and children, not a single death has oc­ curred in the past three months, whereas in an average city in the United States the number of deaths for a similar number of people in that time would have been about thirty from disease. This very remarkable showing can not of course permanent­ ly obtain, but it certainly goes to prove that if good care is taken the isthmus is not a particularly unhealthy place. In October of the 19,000 negroes on the roll eighty-six died fpom disease, pneu­ monia befing'the mctet destructive dis­ ease and malarial fever coming sec­ ond. The difficulty of exercising a thorough supervision over the colored laborers is of course greater than is the case among the whites and they are also less competent to take care of themselves, which accounts for the fact that their death rate is so much higher than that of the whites, in spite of the fact that they have been used to similar climatic conditions. Even among the colored employes it will be seen that the death rate is not high. Diminution of Mosquitoes. In Panama and Colon the death rate has also been greatly reduced, this' be­ ing directly due to the vigorous work of the special brigade of employes -who have been inspecting Houses where the stegomyia mosquito is:to be found and destroying 'W'ytSfWe and breeding places and doing similar work In ex­ terminating the malarial mosquitoes— in short, in performing all kinds of hygienic labor. A little over a year ago all kinds of mosquitoes, including the two fatal species, were numerous about the Culebra cut. In this cut during last October every room cial care has been devoted to minimiz Ins the risk due to the presence of.able to perce-ve.

Since that time the new res ervoir back of Mount Hope has been practically completed. I visited this reservoir. It is a lake over a mile long and half a mile broad. It now carries some 500,000,000 gallons of first class water. I forward herewith a photograph of this lake, together with certain other photographs. of what I saw while I was on the isth­ mus. Nothing but a cataclysm will hereafter render it necessary in the dry season to haul water for, the use Of Colon and Cristobal. Special Message from the President Covering Conditions on Isthmus—Satisfied with Situation—Declares Himself Convinced of the Success of the Stupendous Task One of the most amusing (as well as dishonest") attacks made upon the commission was in connection with this reservoir. The writer in Question usually confined himself to vague gen­ eral mendacity but in this case he specifically stated that there was no wiiter in the vicinity fit for, a reser­ voir (I drank it and it was excellent) and that this particular reservoir would never hold water anyway. Unjust Criticism. Care and forethought have been ex­ ercised by the commission and nothing has reflected more credit upon them than their refusal either to go ahead too fast or to be" deterred by the fear of criticism from not going ahead fast enough. It is curious to note the fact precisely opposite reasons, some com- plaining bitterly that the work Is not in a more advanced condition, while the others complain that it has been rushed with such haste that there has been insufficient preparation for the hygiene and comfort of the'" employes. As a matter of fact neither criticism is Just. It would have been impossible to go quicker than the commission has gone, for such quickness would have meant insufficient preparation. On the other hand, to refuse to do any­ thing until every possible future con­ tingency had been met would have caused wholly unwarranted delay. The right course to follow was exactly the course which has been followed. Ev­ ery reasonable preparation was made in advance, the hygienic conditions in especial being made as nearly perfect as possible while on the other hand timid refusal to push forward the work because of in­ ability to anticipate every possible emergency, for, of course, many de­ fects can only be shown by the work­ ing of the system In actual practice. 6are of Employed. Next In importance to the problem of sanitation, and Indeed now of equal importance, is the problem of secur­ ing and caring for the mechanics, la­ borers and other employes who actu­ ally do the work on the canal and the railroad. This great task has been under the control of Mr. Jackson Smith and on the whole has been well done. At present there are some 6,000 white employes and some 19,000 colored employes on the isthmus. I went over the different places where the different kinds of employes were working I think I saw representa­ tives of every type both at their work and in their homes and I conversed with probably a couple of hundred of "them all told, choosing them~at ran­ dom from every class apd including .those who came especially to present ^certain grievances. I found that' those •who did not come specifically to pre­ sent grievances almost Invariably ex­ pressed far greater content and satis­ faction with the conditions th^n did those who called to make complaint. Nearly 6.000 of the white employes had come from the United States. No man can see these young, vigorous men energetically doing tjleir duty without a thrill of pride In' them as Americans. They represent On the average a high class. "Doubtless to congress the wages paid -thefia will seem high, but as a matter of fact the only general complaint which I found had any real basis among the com plaints made to me upon the isthmus was that, owing to the peculiar sur roundings, the cost of living and the distance from home, the wages were really not as high as they sbqjuld be. In fact, almost every man spoke to felt that* he ought to be receiving ,befog furnished free to I that many of the most severe critics the United State§, it has not so far of the commission criticise them for laborers from the United States. 1 1 air Chinese and Other Labor. Of the 19,000 or 20,000 day laborers e™pl°y,ed10n,the c^nal.a few_h.un!!r!(! are Spaniards. These do excellent work. Their foremen told me that thQy did twice as well as the West In­ dian laborers. They keep healthy and no difficulty is experienced with them I In any way. Some Italian laborers are also employed in connection with the drilling. As might be expected, with labor as high priced as. at present in proved practicable to get any ordinary American wageworkers on the isthmus are the highly paid skilled mechanics of the types mentioned previously. A steady effort is being made to secure Italians, and especially to procure more Spaniards, because of the very satisfactory results that have come from their employment and their numbers will be increased as far as possible. It has not proved possible, however, to get them in anything like the numbers needed for the work, and from present appearances we shall in the main have to rely, for the ordinary unskilled work, partly upon the col­ ored laborers from the West Indies, partly upon Chinese labor. It certainly ought to be unnecessary to point out that the American workingtnan in the United States has no concern what-, ever in the question as to whether the rough work on the isthmus, which Is performed by aliens In any event, is done by aliens from one country with, a black skin or by aliens from an­ other country with a yellow skin.. Our business is to dig tie canal as effi* ciently and as quickly, as possible provided always that nothing is dona that is inhumane to any laborers, and nothing that interferes with the wages should not leave ourselves at the mercy of any one type of foreign la­ bor. At present the great bulk of the unskilled labor on the isthmus is done by West Indian negroes, chiefly from Jamaica, Barbados ahd the other Eng lish possessions. One of the goverd ors of the lands in question has shown an unfriendly disposition to our work and has thrown obstacles in the way? of our getting the labor needed and it is highly undesirable to give, any out­ siders the impression, however ill founded, that they are indispensable and can dictate terms to us. more money—a view, however, which the average man who stays at home have now dealt with the hygienic In the United States probably likewise oonditlons which make It possible to holds- ,as regards himself, '{'.(append figures of the wages paid, so tjihat the congress can judge the tpatter, for it­ self.

All to whom I spoke agreed that the supples were excellent,' and all hut two stated that there was no complaint to be made these two complained that the prices were ex­ cessive as compared to the prices in the States. On investigation I did not feel that this complaint wis well founded. The married men ate at home. The unmarried men sometimes 9te at private boardinghouses, or pri­ vate messes, but more often, judging by the answers of those whom I ques­ tioned, at the government canteens or hotels where the meal costs 30 cents to each employe.

This is: under the-di­ rect control of the chief engineer, Mr. Stevens, who has already shown ad qiirable results, and whom we can safely trust to achieve similar results in, the future. '^Ther work is now going on .with- a vigor .and efficiency' pleasant to wit­ ness. The three big problems of the canal are the Ml Boca dams the Gatun dam and the Culebra cut. the Cfule bra -cut must be made, anyhow but»of odwrte jchangses as ta the or at least to the locksadjacent to the-dams, may ?till occur. The .La Boca d^qas offer no problem, the. bottom material heing tfo good that there is a practical certainty, not merely as to what can be achieved, but- as to. the time of •achievement. -The Oatuo dat^ offers the moat serious problem that waJuLtfi 'K hi'iifliVrfiiii to solve: and yeT the ablest men on .the isthmus .believe that this problem !s certain of solution along the lines proposed although, of course, It ne oessitates great toil, energy and intelli­ gence, and although equally^ of course, there will be some little risk in con-1 nectiou with the work. The risk arises from the fact that some of the mate rial near the bottom Is not so. good as could be desired. If the huge earth dam now contemplated is thrown across from one foothill to the, other we will have what is practically & ,low. broad, mountain ridge behind which will rise the inland lake. This artifi­ cial mountain will probably show less seepage, that is, will have greater re­ straining capacity than the average natural mountain range. The exact lo­ cality of the locks at this dam—as at the other dams—is now being deter­ mined. In April next Secretary Taft, with three of the ablest engineers of the country—Messrs. Noble, Stearns and Ripley—will visit the isthmus, and the three engineers will make/ the final and conclusive examinations as to tj.e exact site fl.r each lock. Meanwhile the work is going ahead without a break. The Culebra cut does not offer such great risks that is, the damage liable to occur from occasional land slips will not represent what may be called ma­ jor disasters. The work will merely call for intelligence, perseverance and executive capacity. It Is, however, the .. work upon which most labor will have to be spent The dams will be com. posed of the earth taken out of the cut and very possibly the building of the locks and dams will take even longer than the cutting in Culebra Itself. Main Work at Culebra. The main work is now being done in the Culebra cut. It was striking and impressive to see the huge steam shov­ els In full play, the dumping trains car­ rying away the rock and earth they dislodged. In the rainy season the steam shovels can do but little in dirt, but they work steadily in rock and la the harder ground. There were some twenty-five at work during the time 1 was on the isthmus and their tremen­ dous power and efficiency were most impressive. As soon as the type of canal was de­ cided this work began in good earnest The rainy season will shortly be over and then there will be an immense in­ crease in the amount taken out "but even during the last three months, in •the rainy season, steady progress is shown by the figures: In August 240, 000 cnbic yards, in September 291,000 cubic "yards and in October 325,000 cubic yards. Passing through the cut the amount of new" work can be seen point has now been sunk about 200 feet below what it originally was. It will have to be sunk about 130 feet farther. Throughout the cut the drill­ ing, blasting, shoveling and hauling are going on with constantly Increas­ ing energy, the huge shovels being pressed up, as if they were mountain howitzers, Into the most unlikely look­ ing places, where they eat their way Into the hillsides. Critics and Doubting Thomases. It is not only natural, but inevita­ ble, that a work as gigantic as this which has been undertaken on the isthmus should arouse every species of hostility and criticism. The condi­ tions are so new and so trying and the work so vast that it would be ab­ solutely out' of the question that mis­ takes should not be made. Checks will occur. Unforeseen difficulties will arise. From time to time seemingly well settled .plans will have to be changed. At present 26,000 men are engaged on the task. After a while the number will be doubled. In such a multitude It is Inevitable that there should be, here and there a scoundrel. Very many of the poorer class of la­ borers lack the mental development to protect themselves against either the rascality of others or their own folly and it is not possible for human wis­ dom to device ft plan by which they can invariably be protected. In a place which has been for ages a by­ word for unhealthfalness and with so large a congregation of strangers sud­ denly put down and set to hard work there will now and then be outbreaks of disease. There will now and then he shortcomings, in- administration there will be unlooked for accidents to delay the excavation of the cut or the building of the dams end locks. Bach such Incident will be entirely natural-and even though serious, no one t^em.will mean more than a little extra delay or trouble. Yet each, when discovered by sensation mongers and retailed to timid folk of little faith, will serve as an excuse for the belief that the whole work is be­ ing badly managed. Experiments will continually be tried In housing, hy­ giene, in, street repMring, ty drfdglng and in digging earth and rock. Now' and then ail experiment will be fc fait*1 ure and among those who hear of it fc oertain proportion of- doubting Thomases wjll at once believe that the whole work,is a failure.,• Doubt­ less herejwd .there some minor, r£* cality wiil be .uncovered but as' to U£5X« to «yrj_h&t jg&r ta§oft pai'nsfaEtng inquiry, "B&kh tit able to find a single reputable person who had jso much «as. heard of any serious accusations affecting the hon­ esty of tljie commission or of any re sponsible officer under It. I append a letter dealing with the mOrit serious 'charge, that of the ownership of lots in Colon the charge was not ad vanced by a reputable man and is utterly baseless. It is not too much to say that the whole atmosphere of the commission breathes honesty as it breathes efficiency and energy. Above all the work has been kept'absolutely clear of politics, khave hevfer Jieard"^' even a suggestion pf sjoils» politics iri^ connection wit|i it. Jff' I have investigated eVery complain£\* brought to me for which there seemed tv to be any shadow of foundation. In^ j. two or three cases I came to the conclu*~j* sion that there was foundation for the"5 complaint and that the methods of the commission In the respect complained, of could be bettered. In the other instances the complaints pfoved ab­ solutely baseless, save in two or three Instances, where they referred to mis­ takes which the commission had aV' ready Itself found out and corrected. H- Slanderers and Libelers. So much for honest criticism. There remains an immense amount of reck­ less slander as has ever been pub­ lished. Where the slanderers are of foreign origin I have no concern with them. Where they are Americans I feel for them the heartiest contempt and indignation because, in a spirit of wanton dishonesty and malice they are trying to interfere with and ham­ per the execution of the greatest work of the itind ever attempted and are seeking to bring to naught tho efforts of their countrymen to put to the credit of America one of the giant feats of the ages. The outrageous accusations of these slanderers con­ stitute a gross libel upon a body of public servants who, for trained in­ telligence, expert ability,,high charac­ ter and devotion to duty have never been excelled anywhere. There is not a man among those directing the work on the-isthmus who has obtained his position on any other basis than merit alone and not one who has used his position in any way for his own per­ sonal or pecuniary advantage. Plan to Build by" Contract. 1 After most careful consideration we have decided to let out most of the Work by contract if we can come to satisfactory terms with the contrac­ tors.. The whole work is of a kind suited to the peculiar genius of' our people and our ijreople have' 'devev oped the type of contractor best fitted to grapple with it. It is of course much better to do the work in large part by contract than to do it all by the government, provided it is possible on the one hand to secure to the con­ tractor a sufficient remuneration to make it worth while for responsible contractors of the best kind to under­ take the work and provided on the other hand it can be done on terms which will not give an excessive profit to the contractor at the expense oi the government After much consid­ eration the plan already promulgated by the secretary of war was adopted, tills plan' in Us essential features wau drafted, after careful'and thorough study and consideration, by the chief engineer, Mr. Stevens, who, while in the employment of Mr. Hill, the pres­ ident of the Great Northern railroad, had personal experience of thid very type of contract. Mr. Stevens then submitted the plan to the chairman of the commission, Mr. Shonts, who went carefully, over it with Mr. Rog­ ers, the legal adviser of the commis­ sion, to see that all legal difficulties were met. He then submitted copias of the plan to both Secretary Taft and myself. Secretary Taft submit­ ted it to some of the best counsel at the New York bar and afterwards I went over it very carefully With Mr. Taft and Mr, Shonts. and .we laid the plan In its general features, before Mr. /Root. My exclusion is that it combines the maximum of advantage with the minimum of disadvantage. Under it a premium will be put upon fthe cspeedy and economical copstruo tion of the canal and a penalty im­ posed on delay and waste. The plan as promulgated is tentative doubt­ less it will have to be changed in some respects before we can come to a sat lsfactory agreement with responsible contractors—perhaps even after the bids have been received and of course it is possible that we can not CQiqe the to an agreement, in which esse government will do th* work, it self.
