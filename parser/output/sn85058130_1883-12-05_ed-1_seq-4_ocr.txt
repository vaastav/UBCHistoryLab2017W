= i V i i I IEIiALDrWEPJnSSDAY DECEMBERS 1883 SALT LAKE DAILY hf f I which 1632 were eitabliehed duinu the last fi cI year The number officers existing under the system ot free delivery sca 154 At the laitr officcee the po taKH or local m itter Ui amounted to 41952 30522 sum S exceeding by 102189401 tbe entire I v oot of tho carrier service of the coun V 1 try Tbe rate 01 iiOttge on drop I letters passing through taese offices I i3 now fixed by law at 2 cents per f half ounce or iracton thereof In offices where the carrier Bvsem ba I not been efatabliehed tbe rate is ocly half ae large It will be remembered that in 1863 when the free deliver U waa first established by law the nni 4 k form singlerate postage upon local b letteia was 1 cent audso it remaind J until 1872 when in those cities where I the carrier service was established H i 1 was increased to defray the expense of such service It seems to me that the old rate may now with proprie 1 be restored and that too even 4 at tbe ritsk of diminishing for a time i 1 at least the receipts of postage upon I local letters I can see no reason why r t that particular air of mail matter t I ghonld be held liable for the entire cost not only of its collection and de I livery but for tho collection and de livery of all other classei and lam jq confident after full consideration of the subject that the reduction of the rate would ba followed by such a i iI i growing accession of businE3 as to i occasion but slight and temporary t loss to the revenues to the postoffice department i J The Telegraph The Postmaster Geneial 1 devotes much or bis report to the considera I I tion in its various aspects ol tbe rela i tion of the gcvernment to the tele graph The great reflection that I have been able to give this subject since my last annual message bas I not led me to change the view which j I there expressed dissenting from the 3 recommendation of the Postmaster Genera that the government agmme iL d the same control over the telegraph i which it baa always exercised over the mail Admitting that its author j ity in the premises is as ample 33 has t ever been claimed for it it would not t i t in my judgment be a wise use of that authority to purchase or as sume the controol of existing tele 4i graph lines or to construct others with a view of entering into gen I eral competition with private enter I prises The objection wnich may be justly urged against either of f these projects and indeed against any system which would n q lire an I I enormous increase in the civil ser vice list do not however apply to I some of the plans which have lately provoked public comment and dis sension It has been claimed for example that Congress might wisely authoriza the Postmaster General to contract with some pri vate person or corporation for the transmission of messages at speci I fied rates and under government supervision various such schemes of tile same general nature but widely differing in their special characteristic3 have been suggested in the public prints and the argu ments by which they have been supported and opposed have doubt I less attracted your attention It is I likely that the whole subject will be I considered by you at ths present F J session In the nature of things it L invests so many questions of detail that your deliberations would prob I ably be aided but slightly if at all Tjy any particular suggestions which I might now submit I avow my be lief however that the government I I should be authorized by law to ex ercise some sort of supervision over interstate telegraph communica tion and I express the hope that for I mining that end some measure 1 J s < devised which will receive I youi probation Fees J The Attorney General criticises in his report the provisions of existing A i law fixing the fees of jurors and witnesses I I nesses in the federal courts The J provisions are chiefly contained in j I the act of Eebrugry 26th 1853 < 1 Though some of them were intra r ducea into that section from statutes ri l which had been passed many years previous It is mani fest that such compensations as I I might when these lawswere enact 4 i ed have been just and reasonable would in many instances be justly q regard at the present day as inad I equate I concur with the At 1 F J torneyGeneral in the belief that tI I the statutes should be revised by r fl which these are regulated so should the laws which regulate the compensation I j pensation of district attorneys and I marshals They should be paid I wholly by salaries instead of in 1i part by fees as is now the case j The change would prove to be a Li measure of economy and would i discourage the institution of need i l less and oppressive legal proceed ings which it is to be feared have f in some instances been con ducted for the mere sake of per i sonal gain J S The Interior Departments Much interesting and valued in formation is contained in the re port of the Secretary of the In i S terior I particularly call your at tention to his presentation of cer tain phases of the Indian question I f to his recommendation for the i repeal of the preemption and tim f ber culture acts and for more strin gent legislation to prevent frauds t under the pension laws The stat utes which preserve the definitions i ana punishments of crimes relating I to pensions could doubtless be made t more effective by certain amend j ments and additions pointed out in i < tha secretarys report I have pre fl viously referred to the alarming 3 1 > state of illiteracy in certain persons I of our country and again submit I for the consideration of Congress I I j whec 2m g l ic1 hould be extended to public primary educa tion where adequate provisions therefor Irive not already been made The Mormons The Utah Commission has sub mitted to the Secretary of the In terior its second animal report in full of its labor In supervising tbe recent election in that Territory pursuant to the act of March 22 1833 It appears that the persons by that act disqualified to the number of about 12000 were excluded from the polls This fact however affords little cause for congratulation and there is fear that it is far from indicating any real and substantial progress toward I the extirpation of polygamy All I of the members of the Legislature are Mormons and there is grave reason to believe that they are in I sympathy with the practices that this government is seeking to sup I press and that its efforts in that re I gard will no more likely encounter their opposition than receive their encouragement and support Even L if this view should happily be er roneous the law under which the I Commissioners have been acting should be made more effective by the incorporation of some such stringent measures as they recom mend as were included in the bill No 2238 on the calendar of the Sen ate at its last session I am con vinced however that polygamy has become so strongly intrenched in the Territory of Utah that it is pro fitless to attack with it any but the stoutest weapons which Constitu tional legislation can make I favor therefore the repeal of the act upon which the existing government de pends the resumption by the na tional legislature of the entire poli tical control of the Territory and the establishment of a commission with such powers and duties as shaH be delegated to it by law Agriculture The department of agriculture is accomplishing much in the direction of the agricultural development of the country and the report of the commissioner giving the results of his investigations and experiments will be found interesting and valuable At this instance a con vention of those interested in the cattle industry of the country was lately held at Chicago The pre valence of pleuropneumonia and other contagious diseases of animals was one of the chief topics of discussion < cussion A committee of the con vention will invite your coopera tion in investigating the causes of these diseases and providing meth ods for their prevention and cave Alaska I trust that Congress will not fail at its present session to put Alaska under the protection of law Its people have repeatedly remonstrated against our neglect to afford them the maintenance of protection ex pressly guaranteed by the terms of the treaty whereby that territory was ceded to the United States For sixteen years they have pleaded in vain for that which they should have received without the asking They have no law for the collection of debt the support of education the conveyance of prop erty the administration of estates or tbe enforcement ot contracts none indeEd for the pun shment of crimi nals except such as are offered against certain customs commerce and navigation acts The resources of Alatka especially in fur mines and lumbr are con siderable in extent and capable of large development while in its geo graphical I situation it is one of politi cal and commercial importance The promptings of interest before as well as considerations of honor and good faith demand the immediate establishment of a civil government in that Territory InterState Commerce Complaints have lately been presented and urged that cer tain corporations controliag in whole or in part the facilities for the interstate carriage of persons and merchandise upon the great railroads of the country have adopted in their dealings with the public divers measures unjust and oppressive in their character In some instances the State governments have attacked and suppressed these evils but in others they have been unable to af ford adequate relief because of the jurisdictional limitations which are imposed on them by the federal cor poration The question of how far the National government may law fully interfere in tbe premises and what if any supervision 01 control it ought to exercise is one which merits your careful consideration While we cannot fail to recognize the im portance of the vast railway systems of the country and their great and beneficial influences upon the developments of our material wealth we should on the other hand remember that no individual and no corporation ought to be in vested with absolute power over all of the interests of other citizens or class of citizens The right of a railway corporation to demand any profitable return upon their invest ments and to reasonable freedom in their regulations must be recog nized but it seems only just so far as its constitutional authority will permit that Congress should pro tect the people at large in their interstate traffic against acts of in justice which the state governments are powerless to prevent In my last annual message I called attention to the necessity of pio tecting by suitable legislation the forests situated upon the public do main In many portions of the west the pursuit of general agricul ture is only made practicable by a resort to irrigation while such use ful irrigation would bo impossible without the aid afforded by forests in contributing to the regularity and constancy of such a supply of water During tee past year severe suffer ing and great loss of property have been occasioned by periods of un usually low water in many of the great rivers of the cjuntry The IrregularItIes in g eat measure were caused uy the removal from about the source of the streims on question ot the timber by which the water supply has been nDurished and protected The preservation of such portion p f the forest on the national domain as will essentially contribute to the equitable flow or important water courses is of the highest conse quence Important tributarie3 of the Missouri Columbia and the Soskotchewan arise in the moun tains of Montana near the northern boundary of the United States be tween the Blaekfeet and Fiathead Indians reservations This region is unsuitable for settlement but I upon the rivers which flow from it depends the future agricultural development of a vast tract of country The attention of Congress is called to the necessity of with drawing from the public sale of this part of the public domain and estab lishing there a forest preserver The industrial exhibitions which have been held in the United States during the present year attracted attention in many foreign countries where the announcement of these enterprises had been made public through the foreign agencies of this government The industrial ex hibition at Boston and the southern exposition at Louisville were largely attended by the exhibitors of foreign countries notwithstanding the absence of any professional character in those undertakings the Centennial expos tion to be held next year at New Orleans in commemoration u of the century of the first shipment of cotton from a port of the United States bids fair to meet with like gratifying success Under the act of Congress of the 10th of February 1883 declaring that exposition to be national and international in its I character foreign governments with which tbe United States maintain relation have been invited to partici pate The promoters of this import I ant undertaking have already re I ceived assurances of the lively inter est which is excited abroad I District Columbia I The report of commissioners of the District of Columbia is hereunto transmitted I ask for it your care ful attention especially for those por tions which relate to assessments oi arteries of taxes and water supply The commissioners who were ap pointed under the act Of January 16th 1883 entitled An act to regulate and improve the civil service of the United States entered promptly upon the discharge of these duties A seres of rules framed in accord ance with the spirit of the statute was approved and promulgated by the President in some particulare wherein they seemed defective these rules were subsequently amended It will provide that they discoun tenance any political or religious tests for admission to the offices of the public service to which the sta tute relates The act is limited in its original application to the classi fied clerkship in the executive de partments at Washington number ing 5600 and to similar positions in the customs districts and postoffices Where as many as fifty persons are employed a classification of these positions analogous to that existing in the Washington offices was duly made before the law went into effect Eleven customs districts and twentythree postoffices were thus brought under the immediate oper ation of the statute Civil Service The annual report of the civil service commission which will soon be suomitted to Congress will afford the means of a mQre definl e judg ment than I am now prepared to express as to the merits of the new system I am persuaded that its I effects have thus far proven bene ficial Its practical methods appear to ba adequate for the ends pro posed and there have been no serious difficulties in carrying them into efftct Since the IGth of July last no person as far as I am aware has been appointed to the public service in the classified portions thereof in any of the departments or any of the postoffices and customs districts above named except those certified by the commission to be more com petent on the basis of the examina tion had in conformity to the rules Presidential Succession Ai the time when the present ex ecutive entered upon his office his death removal resignation or inS ability to discharge his duties would have left the government without a constitutional head It is probable of course thata similar contingency may again arise unless the wisdom of Congress shall provide against its recurrence The Senate at its last session after full consideration passed an act relating to the subject which will now I trust commend itself to the approval of both houses of Congress The clause of the condition on which must depend any law regulating the presidential succession presents also for solu tion other questions of paramount importance These questions relate to the proper interpretation of the phrase inability to discharge the powers and duties of said office Our organic law providing that when the President shall suffer from such Inability the presi dential office shall devolve upon the VicePresident who was him self under like circumstances To giveto such officer as Congress may by law appoint to act as President I have not sec forth numerous in > teresting inquiries which are sug gested by these words of the Con stitution They were fully stated in my first communication to Con gress and have since been the sub ject of frequent deliberations that body It is greatly to be hoped that these momentous questions wil find speeay solution lest the emer gency may arise when long delay will be impossible and may furnish cause for anxiety and alarm Miscellaneous For the reasons fully stated in my last annual message I repeat my recommendation that Congress propose an amendment to that pro vision of the Constitution which prescribed the formalities for the enactment of laws whereby in re spect to bills for the appropriation of public money the executive may be enabled while giving his ap proval to particular items to inter pose his veto as to such others who d not commend themselves to his judgment The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution confers the rights of citizenship upon all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof It was the special purpose of this amendment to in sure members of the colored race the full enjoyment of CiVIl and political rights Certain statu tory provisions intended to secure the enforcement of those rights have been recently declared unconstitu tional by the Supreme Court Any legislation whereby Congress may lawfully supplement the gqarantees which the Constitution affords for the equal enjoyment by all the citi zens of the United States of every right privilege and immunity of citizenship will receive my unhesi tating approval Signed
