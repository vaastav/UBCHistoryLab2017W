Mvoh talk there is of the "mediocrity' of M. Sadi-Carnot. This means prob ably that he is a plain, common sense. man, of fair intelligence and strong integrity. "With these qualities teadi Carnotwilldo. A week from next Monday is the city election in Boston, and Mayor Hush OT.rien is again the Democratic candidate. As usual, the preachers are taking a hand. These "rum, Romanism and rebellion" fellows sometimes do wonders.

Democracy are in the as cendant, and this is the way to keep the column in line and moving on. Truth is mighty and will prevail. The President on Tuesday sent to the Senate the following nominations: Lucius Q. C. Lamar, Miss., associate justice of supreme court of United :-States; Wm. F.

As .a general rule Democrats are opposed to anything that savors of an honest and free expression of the will of the people, i ne democrat is no excep tion to the general rule. (JJevejana Leader. It is impossible for the Leader to ispeak of a Democrat truthfully "on general principles." f The thing is to get "an honest and free-expression," as well as an honest count. TniCXew York Sun announces its intention to support Cleveland next year. .This is the paper which ealled Grover .horrid names three years ago and -said he couldn't carry New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Having (discovered that Grover is a statesman and .a. gentleman, the Sun is manly -enough toio the right thing, hence its (conversion. And this journalistic change of :heart is in the nature of a good-sized political straw. Thousands and hundreds of thousands will vote for Cleveland next year who refused him support in 1884. The exports and imports of the United States the past year nearly bal ance each other, the exports amounting to 724,tfc25.735, and the imports to 707, Ot!2,4!(i. This ma-kes a total foreign trade for the year of 1.431,fe8,233, against a foreign trade of 1,352,8'J5,4C4 in 1881, an increase of nearly $80,000,000 in the last twelve months. Substan tially all this trade is carried in foreign ships, because underour tariff and nav igation laws Americans cannot com pete with foreigners in the carrying trade. Chairman Niswonges, has a rather lengthy card in Tuesday's Repository, in reply to the Masillon Independent, in explanation of his course in adjourn ing the Farmers' Institute. In his card Mr. Niswonger says: a "MeGrecor heinsr nresent and on rocrramme. I managed with him for a I ialf hour talk. He found no fault with this, but had there been time he would have prolonged his address. He talked until he voluntarily quit, made a bow and retired to his seat. Without wishing to find fault, Mr. N. should have said, "I limited him to a half hour." Mr. N. will also remember, no doubt, that, during some applause he told Mr. McGregor he would have to quit, when the speaker said he would wind up with a few closing words, which was done. Of course Mr. McGregor cheerfully obeyed orders, for he was invited, and he had no wish to Intrude, and makes no complaint so far as he is concerned.

WONDER IT WASN'T WORSE. Meagre Account of a Wreck on the Delaware & Hudson Railway. Troy, N. Y, Dec. 7. Special. Information was received here .this morning that the Montreal express on the Delaware & Hudson Canal railroad, which left Troy at 12.05 a. m., ran off the track when near the station of Whaleneburg. The station and cars were set on fire. The wires are down and no details can be had; hut it is feared that many passengers have been killed, as the train was heavily loaded. Albany, N. Y, Dec. 7. Special . Superintendent Hammond, of the Dela ware & Hudson Canal Railway Com pany, says that the Montreal express going north was wrecked at an early hour this morning while exactly oppo site the Whalensburg Btation. The accident was caused by a broken axle under the tender. The station, a bag gage car, an express car and one pas senger coach were destroyed by fire. At first it was reported that an old lady was seriously hurt by being thrown from her berth in the sleeping car, but later information . states that no one was injured. The wires are down, and it is impossible to obtain any definite news at the present time. No Jury Yet. Ravenna, O., Dec. 7. Special. The grind commenced again this morn ing in the Hulligan murder case, num ber three, and it looks very much as though the defense were going to exhaust all of their peremptory challenges. Forty-eight men were on hand when court opened and A. D. Beardsley was the first man who quali fied himself as a juror. The defense have exercised seven peremptory chal lenges and still have sixteen in reserve. In General Debility, Emaciation.
