PASO HERALD Editorial and Magazine Page Monday, December Ninth. 1912. An Army Engineer THEODORE ROOSEVELT -during, his term as president nearly always mani fested a happy faculty for picking out strong men to do his work. The chief members of his cabinets were as a rule men of uncommon force; their intellectual equipment, experience in affairs, and executive ability were beyond the average of presidential cabinets. His appointments to high posts in govern ment service were as a rule not open to criticism on the ground of the incompetence of the appointee. Roosevelt surrounded himself with strong men and that, after all, is the principal source of strength for any chief executive, in business or political life. Which is merely preliminary to a testimonial to the tremendous accomplish ments of one of president Roosevelt's appointees, CoL Goethals. When the govern ment was ready to begin construction on the Panama canal, eight or nine years ago, a board of the greatest civil engineers to be found in the country was appointed to perfect the plans and start work. The first commission split up in a general row, and was succeeded by a second commission of railroad executives and civil engineers, with some army and civilian representation. A board of European engineers representing the principal countries was constituted to consult and advise with the American commission upon the broad plans and details of the work. Things moved slowly. Money was flying. The canal strip was not efficiently governed. Sanitary conditions were hardly better than under the French regime. The death rate was terrible. It became almost impossible to keep laborers. Thousands of workmen were brought over from Cuba, Porto Rico, and the other West Indian islands, negroes who were thought to be acclimated and proof against tropical disease. They died or became sick and weak. Even Chinese and Japanese were tried, with no more success. The civil commissions split all to pieces. There was no head or tail to the organization. The attempt had been made to create a seven headed organization, with the usual result. One chief engineer after another was tried, without any improvement Salaries of $25,000, 540,000, $75,000 a year did not seem to bring out the Man For toe Job. Things were looking gloomy. Original estimates had been thrown aside, so rapidly were the unit costs running ahead of estimates. Accidents were frequent. Losses multiplied. Strikes threatened. The bureaus and politicians at Washing ton were all trying to take a hand in running the canal business. The large com missions were reduced. A three-headed organization wa's tried. It failed. The civil engineers threw up their hands and quit. The civil engineers and the others on the early commissions did splendid work. It is a mistake to assume that they were unfitted for the work they had to do. Their plans are the ones being followed today. Their plans have been approved by hundreds of the greatest engineering experts in the world. They blocked out the work, made the estimates, decided on the type of canal, outlined every detail in the form it is now assuming in the finished construction. The men were appointed to those commissions from posts of the highest technical and executive achieve ment in great industrial and public enterprises, and they have gone back to private employment wherein they rate at the very top of their profession, some with salaries of $100,000 or more a year, which no doubt they earn. They were working for the government under extremely discouraging conditions. Politics dominated everything, congress would not keep hands off, everybody was trying to ran the thing to suit himself, real power was withheld from the commission, and no single individual, though he might be fitted for efficient executive work, could be held responsible when there was no centralization of directing force. The commission schemes were all right for counsel and planning, but they lacked the first essential of an organization formed to carry out any great project. The only safe rule of conduct of any important undertaking is to find the right man to lead and direct, make him totally responsible, and then give him powea equal to the responsibility. To carry through the Panama canal, the responsible executives must be free to act, and not be kept forever sitting in committee rooms answering fool questions about immaterial details. Any big man doing big work wants to go his own gait, so long as the final result is in line with the desires of those who employ him. The conditions of the Panama work in those earlier days jsrere intolerable to any man of pride, spirit, and executive ability. To the cabinet one day Theodore Roosevelt unburdened his troubles. "What in h Panama is the United States army for?" he inquired somewhat petulantly. "What is West Point for? What do we train engineers for? Is there no man in the whole army establishment that can take this thing up and put it through? Two hundred million three hundred four hundred million what's the odds, we want a canal and we want it now." The president sent for one of the modest fellows in khaki, with whose kind we in El Paso have become tolerably well acquainted. George Goethals had just been promoted from major to lieutenant colonel of engineers. He had done some work on river protection and fortifications, and knew a thing or two "about cuts and fills. He also was that unusual and efficient type of executive, known, not as a driver of men, but as a leader. Goethals was just one of a few thousand West Point graduates that had been plodding along in the usual way, but Goethals spent rather less time than some in studying the army register and inquiring after the health of officers above him in line of promotion. He was a worker, by choice as well as circumstance. The president liked his looks; he was a trim, well built, keen eyed fellow with a twinkle that relieved the half grimness of the veteran soldier. Goethals was made chairman and chief engineer of the isthmian canal commission, April 1, 1907, after three civil chiefs, Wallace, Shouts, and Stevens, had stepped out one after another. All the other members of the previous commissions had retired, including even Hains, Ernst, Harrod, andJEndicott, representing the army and navy. The field was clear. The president named on the commission two majors of engineers, a bureau chief, two or three civilians, and CoL W. C. Gorgas of the army medical corps. "You are the boss, and the only boss on that job," said Roosevelt as her sent Goethals away; "Now go to it" The Isthmian Canal commission nowadays is seldom heard of. Once a year it makes an elaborate report to the president, which is transmitted to congress. Between times the commission attends to a multitude of details of administration, and travels occasionally for inspection. Every now and then a member gives a. stereopticon lecture in Washington or New York to show people how the work progresses. After he had been thoroughly tried out, Goethals was made a colonel of engineers. He has had under him from the start an army of 30,000 to 45,000 men. He is directing the expenditure of $400,000,000 of the people's money. When the president asked him five years ago when he thought he could have the ditch com pleted, Goethals replied that the canal would be ready for ships on January 1, 1915. All the arrangements for the formal opening, the unprecedented international naval display, the great expositions at San Francisco and San Diego, have been arranged for 1915. Now comes the joke: The scientific world hooted at the idea that the canal could be finished in so short a time. Foreign engineers called us fools. "More likely 1935," they said. In the senate and house of representatives, men got up and said that the canal would bankrupt the United States and take a generation to build. But the Man For the Job had been found at last In a little speech at Port land, Oregon, a year ago, president Taft said he had been assured by Col. Goethals that the canal would be open for passage by the Fourth of July, 1913. A year and a half earlier than his best expectations had been when he began, and a geological age ahead of the expectations of some of the chronic croakers. The canal was begun by the French half a century ago. When the Americans took hold of the work, 30,000,000 cubic yards had been excavated; nearly 150,000,000 cubic yards remained to be excavated. The Americans began work May A, 1904. When Goethals took hold in 1907, about 9,000,000 cubic yards had been taken out, leaving 140,000,000 to go. Goethals will have the work done in another six months, his average being more than 20,000,000 cubic yards per year, or 600 times the bulk of the ten-story Paso del Norte hotel removed every year twice the bulk of the 12-story Mills building every day. President Taft recommends in his message to congress that CoL Goethals be made a major general and placed in line for appointment to be the next chief of engineers. There is another modest fellow down there, from the army. He is CoL Gorgas, medical man, who has spent 515,000,000 to make the isthmus a fit place to live in, anil has reduced the death rate below that of almost any city in the United States. The isthmus of Panama is a model of perfect sanitation, though it has 12 feet of rain every year and used to be the worst pest hole in the world. Neither of these feats is to be classed as in any sense miraculous. Each is just a good example of the results to be expected from a combination of wellf direcetd thought with hard work, and never a thought of personal gain or personal glory.

(New Tork Press.) A lie that comes from nowhere can go everywhere. A man's idea of the government being all right is if his own bank account is. A man lies a little to keep out of trouble and then a lot to get out. The average man who wants to be generous begins with himself so strong ly he can't go any further. a One of the most unique events in the whole history of ban- . ;uft giving will take place in Wash ington on the evening of January 11, when the Xaticnal Geographic society will give its eighth annual banquet. Here the intrepid Amundsen and the undaunted Peary, the two men who , conquered every obstacle that had , thwarted generations of explorers and ' discovered the north and soilth poles, i will meet in the presence of the mcui- 1 bers of the organization from many ! parts of the country, one as the guest , of honor and the other as the toast- j master of the evening. A ever before in the history of dinner giving has such a thing taken place, and it is only recently that such an event has been possible. Norway and the United States will jointly celebrate the splen- did achievements of their gallant ex- J i"wicio v iiuiii kite perns ul ciernai cold, perpetual snow and never dis appearing ice could not baffle in the quest of the poles. Another Medal for Amundsen. This is not the first time that Capt Roald Amundsen has been honored by the National Geographic society. On December 14, 1907, he was awarded the society's gold medal one of the rarest tronhies in nil fif-Tail honors for the discovery of the north west passage. He will now be awarded a special gold medal for his achieve ments in south polar exploration, and it will be placed in his hands by the man who has stood at the other end of the earth, himself a medalist of this organization. Many hundreds of society members, the president of the United States, the members of the cabinet, the justices of the supreme court, the diplomatic corps, members of the senate and house of representa tives representing the society's mem bership in every state and territory and a number of foreign geographers will witness this -unique ceremonial. Membership Totaln 1C5.0O0. The National Geographic society Is the most extensive in its membership and the richest in its scientific pro jects and resources among all the geo graphic organizations of the world. With a membership of 165,000 resid ing in all parts of America and reach ing to all parts of the world, no other organization anywhere nearly ap proaches it in that respect; and with a sinking fund of nearly 

J'JO.OOO. a fund that does not represent the gift of a few rich men, but the contributions of thousands and tens of thousands of American citizens who thus testify their interest in geographic matters, no other organization approaches it in the character of endowment. Next year the society will celebrate the first quarter century of its exist ence, and a great effort is being made to bring the total membership up to 200,086 by that time. Growing a thou sand folfi in 25 years is an achieve ment of which any organisation might be proud, whatever its character or its aims. And, if the National Geo graphic society reaches its coveted 200,000 mark next year it will have grown a thousand fold in 25 years, for when it was organized in 1S8S it had about 200 members. The society was not always the popu lar geographic organization that it is today. At its beginning it was a so ciety of technical geographers. They had not come to understand that there are hundreds of thousands of people who have as deep an interest in geogra phy as they,, and that the interest of other hundreds of thousands might bo quickened. There are so many thousands of peo ple who are interested enough in geo graphic matters to read a magazine devoted entirely to the subjects of travel, the commercial sciences and the world's people, that onlv a com- 5 paratively few magazines in America nave a greater circulation than has the National Geographic Magazine. It is a magazine, however, whose profits do not find their way into private pockets; they go into the treasury of the society, and, in fact practically support it. It stands out unique in magazine making and in scientific so ciety hi3tory. Instead of being sup ported by a society, the society is largely supported by it. Aids Many Expeditions. In TecenC years the society, through its research committee, of which pro fessor Henry Gannett is chairman, has been contributing substantially to di rect geographic research. It began this line of work first by sending smal: expeditions to study the volcanoes of Mont Pelee and La Soufriere, a trained geologist to Sicily to study the earth quake causes and effects, and later sent representatives into the Arctic regions on several expeditions, also contributed financially to the Pear? expedition resulting in the discovery of the north pole. More recently it has maintained a special expedition en gaged in the study of the glaciers of Alaska. There is being enacted today in Alaska where the finest glacial sys tem in existence is to be found, the same sort of natural phenomena that took place in the glacial epoch, and there for three years a special expe dition under the directions of professor jtaipn a. uarr. ot uorncii, and pro fessor Lawrence Martin, of the Uni versity of Michigan, has been sup ported by the society. This represents the most important step yet taken by a geographic organization In the di rection of mastering the geography of the geologic past. During the present year the society had joined hands with Yale university in the maintenance- of a large expedi tion in Peru, headed by professor Hi ram Bingham, for the purpose of mak ing geographic, geologic and archaeo logical investigations in the Vilcamba valley and around "Cuzco. The civili zation of the Incas, contemporary with that of the Aztecs and the Mayas, represents the highest development to which any American people ever reached before Columbus sailed and the archaeological work of the expedi tion promises to clear up some of the doubtful points in the history of these remarkable people. Furthermore, the region ardund Cuzco has a most re markable geologic history. Last summer the society sent George C. Martin, geologist of the United States Geological survey to Alaska to study the big' volcanoes there, the famous Katmai in particular. This work was preliminary to a general study of the volcanoes of Alaska, which the society will undertake next year. It also assisted W. E. C Todd, of the Carnegie museum, of Pitts burg, in making a biological survey of the region east of Hudson bay. Winter Course of Lectures. For a number of years the winter course of addresses delivered before the National Geographic society in Washington have been a feature of the life of the national capital, but those this year are attracting unusual attention. The series was opened by Viyijalmur Stefansson, who discovered the blond eskimo of Coronation gulf. There are three or four lectures in the series dealing with various phases of the war in the near east; a number of mountain climbers will tell of their ad ventures; president Eliot, of Harvard, will tell how to establish a strong gov ernment in China; Dr. Yamei Kin, the leading woman physician of the orient, will give the story of the new woman in China: O.

GEORGE FITCH. Author of "At Good Old Slivnsh." JAMES ABRAM GARFIELD was a young man wLo Lad a magnificent start as a canal pilot and could have risen to the top of the profession, but who ruined his chances in this line by quitting work ami going to college. Manv of the oldest canal men on the old Ohio canal back, in the late forties pleaded with young Garfield to stick to his work and rise until he had a canal boat of l-is own aitd could smoke all day on the after deck, but he was headstrong and would not do so. Instead he "went to college and joined a Greek letter so ciety, raised whiskers and helped duck freshmen in the president's horse trough. I li ik aiiected his mind so that he be came president of a college himself for a short time. But his frivolous nature made him resign once more, just as things were coming his way, and become a lawyer. Xo sooner had young Garfield done this than he got himself elected to the Ohio senate, thus eluding a client who had almost decided to retain him. And Dear AVinifred Black: I would be greatly obliged to you if jou would tell me how I can cure my husband of doling out his money to mc. We are fie in family and of course T am obliged to ask for money every daj or two when it is given to me In such small sums. On every occas ion I have to listen to things that woud not look well in print, but oh. how they do hurtk Now. he is a business man, and can well afford to give me $1S in one lump each week, which is all I want, and out of which, I told him, I would pay the rents and gas bill. But it's no use. He says I could not take care of the money. Love him? Of course I do. I just think he's one of the best fellows in the world except when I have to ask for money. This thing has made a theif of me. I have taken money out of his pocket many times when he was asleep. He never misses it. but, oh, how I hate myself for it! Wife.

HERE, there's a letter from one ' 1 of them, and it looks like a let- lot "Joined a fraternity, raised whiskers and helped duck freshmen in the presi dent's horse trough." he had no sooner become a power in the senate than he threw away his chances once more and went south as lieutenant colonel of an Ohio regiment in the civil war. Young Garfield had now frittcrca away his life until he was 32 years old and everybody said it was a pity that he had no stability, having given up five good chances in ten years. But he persisted in his course and no sooner had he become a major general than he resigned once more and went to con gress. This was a fine opening for Garfield and he stuck to his job until 1SS0 against tne express wishes ' ot many . uemocratic candidates in his district. In 1880 he became United States senator and all would have been well had he not gone to the Chicago convention to help nominate Sherman for president and ac cidentally got nominated himself. He was elected president that fall and was just getting settled in the office the next July when he was shot by a more than ordinarily offensive office seeker and died the following Septem ber. Garfield was not quite 50 when he died and had bright prospects. In fact, he could have made a good success in any one of his ventures if he had not been so restless. Restlessness has spoiled many fine farmers, lawyers and soldiers by making presidents out of them. Copyright by George Matthew Adams. ter from a sure enough woman, too.

Love a man like that! You must be a very affectionate crea ture. I'd want him to take himself and his money so far away that I never would even hear of them again. Leave him? No, I don't think I would do that.

Put him face to face for once with the daily task that is yours, the task that takes all vour brain, all vour T energy, all your ingenuity to manage and see what he will do about it. Don't let him suspect you for a min ute! don't scold, don't cry, just be helpless, and wondering and "im pressed."

These two extremes attract such a monopoly of attention that there is little heed given the great big array of Christmas shoppers who buy in a spirit of sanity.

Be Individual. And so I say to my girls: Don't say "I can't be economical, because I have never joinea an economy club.

Then the majoral proposed a toast to his old friends whom, he was pleased and happy to see at his table. The glasses were raised, filled to the brim with a very precious wine, which had been brought in an old and dusty bottle. Romana. with a supreme effort, suppressed her sobbing, but tears were glistening in her eyes and her hand trembled violently as she raised the glass to" her lips. Then the ma joral's words were interrupted of three resounding Mows on the front door of the house. The dogs barked and the rain poured down. Heavy steps were heard, the door opened and a figure wrapped in a heavy cloak appeared. "Have I come in time?" a vo-ce asked. Everybody umped up with cries cf surprise and joy.
