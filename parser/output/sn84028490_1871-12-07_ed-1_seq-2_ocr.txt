An exchange gives a careful digest the business awaiting the action of this, the Forty-Second Congress, at its present session. About eight hundred oiiis mm ber up the files of the Senate and House. Over two hundred and fifty relate to pen .- . .-4 nnintu claims, and about one oiuiio u . hundred to railroad, canal and steamship jobs. Political wire pulling will occupy the attention ef the members generally and but little iudicious legislation may be looked fjr. The lobby this session will be an important department of Congress and ir.rilv thev shall have their rich reward. The schemes that will bring to them the rich harvest are.financial legislation ; reve nue customs; the reissue of the national currency ; the repeal ; the reduction ; or the imposition of certain taxes ; the abolition of the naval and military academies ; the regulating of the rights of corporations to transact business in the several states ; the issue of writs from the Federal courts; the remodelling of the' judicial cUstajicta ; the suppression of the "Ku-Klur ; the re moval of political and civil disabilities ; labor statistics; the Alabama claims; pen sions; homestead laws; bounties ; reminis cences of "Bleeding Kansas ;" Indian af fairs ; special legislation apart from land grants and other subsidy schemes ; inter nal improvements and communication ; French spoliation claims ; the new postal pension, and other codes; the appropria tions demanded for new public buildings ; the next Congressional apportionment ; specific, remedies and special jobs relating to the maritime-interests of the-conntry .; immigration ; land and submarine", tele graphy ; and a bewildering variety of schemes. It will be marvellous i at scores of loopholes thieves do not break through and steal. The railroad bills alone now pending number forty-seven-At least thirty-five of these ask for land grants to the amount of $30,000,000 acres, and provide for the construction of 12,0QO miles of railroad. Visions of fat jobs arise that might well overpower the most grasping cupidity. The.prizes that temp ted Tammany pale their , ineffectual fires before those which dazzle ambitious Con gressmen. "'I . ' . The Washington - correspondent of the Savannah (Ga.) iVVus has the following about city affairs : ' ' ' THE 

WASHINGTON RING. In my next letter I propose to pay my respects to the. "Washington Ring," which .is- formed - after the exact fashion .of tbe Tammany Ring of New York.. In. doing this, I shall have to say something about an institution known here as the Fjreed men's Savings Bank and Trust Company, an institution whose branches extend throughout the entire South. These branch beuses are established for the pur; pose of collecting the hariearninjs of tbe treedmen, and sending tbem here to head quarters, to be used for speculative purpo ses, and to enrich the managers. The correspondent then goes on to speak of "tho conduct of these people in dealing with the finances of the Freedmen's Sa vings Bank, and promises in his -next letter some matters that will be quite in- " teresting and exciting. IN discussing the financial afuirs of South Carolina, the Nation gives' the case of the State Treasurer, NilesG.,Parker, who, it says, kept a bar In Haverhill, Massachusetts, before the war. He en tered the army ; settled as a carpet-bagger in Chaileston ; opened another grocery- "went into politics;" was made an alder man ; cultivated the negro ; failed in busi ness; paid thirty cents on the dollar; rose rapidly in politics; became State Ireasu rer, and is now reputed to be wortn a millinn. and has Dlentv of diamonds. Put behind such men the' most corrupt and ignorant Legislature that ever caricatured free government in a civilized State, and we see why the financial condition of tbe State is suspected. Of the twenty-four millions raised by . onifrnmtnt of Ohio six and a half millions, over a fourth of it, goes to the support of tbe Public Schools. So much for the school-master. . Now, contrast with th General Government. Of three hundred and twenty-three millions expen dml, during the last two years, omitting all payments for principal and interest on the Pub!ic Debt, one hundred and forty millions, almost one half has been paid to support the army and navy. Instruments of force, are the expensive parts ef the general goverameot We prefer the school- master and tbe scnow marm. .

The third annual message of President Grant will be found in this paper. Like predecessors, it is brief, and that may the greatest merit. He recommends that internal taxes, except those upon all SDirita and tobacco be abolished. This is borrowed from the National Reformers. He is rather in favor of general amnesty, but thinks the more prominent rebels should still be disqualified to held office. The message is a clumsy bungling, ua- atatemanlike document and is wholly un like those able documents that used to emanate from our Presidents prior to 1S61. General Grant claims to have executed the laws everywhere! Is it according to law this thing of sending his son, a sub ordinate army officer, to Europe in a gov ernment vessel, win. u the law expressly forbids it? The law also forbids army of- ficers holding civil offices, and yet tnree such are in positions at the White House-! t?t unr nf Internal Revenue. 8th -r -kt v ;a. ..,f f ,; district, . ...ii : j.

Let all read the message. General S. G. Bcrbridg struck Col. O'Neal a blow in the face on December 1st in Covington, Ky. It seems O'Neal called Burbridee a liar. The same day O'Neal nmia m. note to B.. saving love for his family prevented a challenge. B. replied he (O'Neal) need not consider his family and the correspondence so that O'Neal might get satisfaction, each party referring all arrangements to mutual friends in Captain Tisdale and Colonel Terrell. When all came to all, Tisdale wro;e a note say ing his iriend O'Neal's demand for satis faction had no reference to the "code of honor." Terrell was taken by surprise and declared he was not a "peace com missioner." O'Neal's courage, like Bob Acres's. oozed out at the palms of his hands, and so there was not even a bit of a ficht after all and no prospect. The correspondence reminds us of Bombastes "The man that dare these boots diaplaee, Miut meet Bombeatee taee to face." I

ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS. To the Senate and i House of Representatives : In addressing my third aunual message to the law-making branch of the Govern ment, it is gratifying to be able to state that during ihe past year success has gen- rarvj attotuS?d the effort to execute all laws found upon the statute-books. The policy has been not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent and to en force them accordingly. .. 

DISASTERS BY STORM AND FIRE. The past year has. under a wise Provi dence, been one of general prosperity to ed with mofe tJjan agual chastisements, ja the loss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have serv ed to call forth the best elements of hu- man nature in our country, and develop friend8hip for us on the part of foreign nations which goes far toward alleviating tbe distresses occasioned by these calami- ties., lne benevolent who have so gener- 0U8'V 8hred their means with the victims of these mislortunes, will reap their re ward in the consciousness of having per formed a noble act, and in receiving the grateful thanks of men. women and chil dren whose sufferings they have relieved. OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS. The relations of the United States with foreign pesters continue to be friendly. The year has been a? eventful one, in wit nessing two creaniations. speaking one language and having one lineage, settling by peaceful arbitration disputes of long standing, and liable at any time to bring tbase nations into bloody and costly con flict. An example has thus been set which, if successful in its final issue, may be loiioweaoy oinercivuizea nations, ana the means of returning to pro- ... 1. .. -1- !

I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty I alluded to, which has been concluded since tbe adjournment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty, aud a copy of the Pro tocols of the conterences of the Lumrais sioners by whom it was negotiated. The treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between tbe two na tlons. Various Questions are to be ad justed by arbitration. I recommend Con gress at an early day to make the neces sary provision for the tribunal at Geneva. for the several commissions on the part of tbe United btates, called for by tbe treaty. His Alaiesty. tbe King of Italy, the Jrres ident of the Swiss Confederation and his Majesty the EmpTor of Brazil, have each consented, on the joint request of the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the tri bunal at Ueneva. 1 have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has pleased to comply with the joint request of the two governments, and has consented to act as tbe arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and Great Britain. The contracting parties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between themselves certain principles of public law for which the United States have contended from the commencement of their history They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of other maritime powers and to invite them to accede lo them. Negotiations are going on as to the form or tbe mode by whicn tbe invitation is to be extended to the powers. I recommend the legislation necessary en the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries and to the other matters touching tbe relations of the United states toward the isntieh INortn American provinces, to become operative so soon as tbe proper legislation shall be had on tbe part of Great Britain and its possessions, as it is much to be desired that this legislation may become opera. tive before the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrangements for the coming season, 1 bave addressed a communication, bf which a copy is transmitted herewith, to the Uovernors el iNew lork, Pennsylva nia. Ohio. Indiana. Michtcran. Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon the Governments of tnose states respectively the necessary action on their part to carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of tho canals on either side connected with the navigation of tbe lakes and rivers forming the bound. ary, on terms of equality by the inbabi iants of both countries. It is. hoped that the importance ot tbe object and the ben efits to flow - therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanction ot tbe estates concerned I THE FORTY-NINTH PARALLEL. I renew the recommendation for an ap propriation for determining the true posi tion of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it lorms the boundary between tbe United States and the British North American provinces, between the Lake of the woods and tbe summit et the Kocky Mountains, ibe early action ot Congress on this recommendation would pnt it in tbe power of the War Department to place a lores m tne Held during the next sum mer.

(w. mans in, rrance, by tbe diplomatic and nnn.HUr rnut;- f ka jiAitA States in that country. It ia iust to add that the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the Minister and Consul General at Paris and the various Consuls in France under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well aa with prudence and tact. Tbeir curse has received the commendation of the German Government, and has wounded no susceptibility of the French. GERMANY STILL FRIENDLY. The Government of the Emperor of uermany continues lo manifest a friendly leenng towaraa the United States, and a desire to harmonize with the moderate and just policy which this Government main tains in lU relations with the Asiatic powers, as well as with the South Ameri can- ivepuDUcs. l nave given assurances tnat tne Inendly leelings of that govern ment are fully shared by the United Sutes. I he ratifications of the consular and na turalization conventions with the Austro- Ilunganan Empire have been exchanged. ITALY. I have been officially informed of the annexation of the States ef the Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of that kingdom to Rome. In conformity with the established policy of At- It.. . "l . , T I .... me uuueu auues, i nave recognized tms change. The ratifications of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged. The two powers have agreed in this treaty that private property at sea Bhall be re spected during a war between the two powers. Ihe United fe tales bave spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into me congation oi nations. CLAIMS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS AGAINST SPAIN. The forty-first Congress, at its third session, made an appropriation for the or ganization of a mixed commission for ad judicating upon the claims 'of citizens of tbe United States against Spain, growing out of the insurrection in Cuba. That commission baa since been organized. I transmit herewith the correspondence re. lating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It ia to Ije looped that this commission will aaoru -.u? cJuu,i, pvuip.ew reiueay . .. - - - - . . luc" RESTORATION OF PEACE BETWEEN SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICA. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a con- ference at Washington between the pleni potentaries of Spain and the allied South American Republic, which has resulted in an armistice with iho reasonable asauJ ance of a permanent peace. 

RUSSIA—THE GRAND DUKE—CATACAZY. The Intimata friendly relations which bave so long existed between the United Statee and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor ii a proof that there ' ia no desire on the of his government to diminish the cordiality of these relations. The hospi table reception which has been given to Grand Duke is proof that on our part share the wishes of that government. inexcusable course of the Russian Minister at Washington rendered it ne cessary to ask his recall, and to decline to longer receive that functionary as a di- plomatic representative. It was impossi ble with sell respect, or with a iust regard lo the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. latacazy to continue to hold inter course with this Government, after his personal abuse of Government officials and during his persistent interference through various means wuu me relations between the bnited States and other powers. In accordance with my wishes, this Govern ment nas been relieved of further inter course with Mr. Catacazv. and the manage mem oi tne auaiis ot the imperial lega tion uaa passea into me nanus ot a gentle' man entirely unobjectionable. OUR INTERCOURSE WITH JAPAN. With Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado has, since the close of tbe last ses sion of Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of import ance in several aepartments ol tbe liov- ernment. X nave reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The cor respondence transmitted herewith shows th.it there is no disposition on the part of this Lrovernment to swerve from its estab lished course. THE WAR WITH COREA. a to put an to the barbarous treatment of our shipwreck ed sailors on tne uorean coast. 1 instructed our Minister at Peking to endeavor to con clude a convention with Corea for securing the safety and humane treatment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to protect him in case of nee. A small surveying party sent out. on reaching the coast, was treacherously attacked at adis- aavantage. Ample opportunity was given lor explanation ana apology to the insult. Neither came. A force then landed, and I after an arduous march over a rugged and I difficult country, the forts from which the outrages were committed were reduced by a gallant assault, and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the honor of tbe flag, the expedition returned, finding it impos sible under the circumstances to conclude tbe desired convention. I respectfully re fer to the correspondence relating thereto nerewun submitted, and leave tbe subject for such action as Congress may see fit to take. THE MEXICAN FREE ZONE. The Republic of Mexico has not repeal ed the very objectionable laws established, relative to what is known as the Free Zone, on the frontier of the United States. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and that more stringent measures may be taken by the Republic forrestraining law less persons on its frontiers. 1 bope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon re lieve this Government of the difficulties experienced from these causes. THE SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS. Our relations with the various Republics of Central and South America continues. with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by Uongres regarding the overdue install ments under the award of the Venezuela Claims Commission of 1866. The internal dissensions of this government present no justification for their absence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratification of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua baa been exchanged. 

EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES IN BRAZIL. It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory step towards the abolition of slavery. Out relations with that Empire, always cordial, will naturally be made more so by this ict. It is not too much to hope that the government of Brazil may hereafter find it for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance towards entire emancipation more rapidly than the present attempt contemplates. 1 he true prosperity and greatness of a nati n is to be found in the elevation and education ol its laborers. It is a subject lor regret that the reforms in this direction which were volnntarily promised by the statesman of Spain, have not been carried out in its West India colonies. The laws and regu lations for the apparent abolition of slav ery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave moat of tbe laborers in bondage with no hope of release until tneir lives become a burden to their employers. 

AMERICAN CITIZENS OWNING SLAVES ABROAD. I desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens of the United States, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, are large holders in foreign lands of this species of property, forbidden by fundamental law of their alleged conn- try. 1 recommend to Congress to provide by stringent legislation a suitable lemedy against the holding, owning or dealing in slaves or being interested in slave property in foreign lands, either as owners, heirs or mortgagees by citizens ol the United States THE CUBAN INSURRECTION. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the Island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory. without apparent prospect of an early termination, cannot be other than an ob Mrt nf concern in a neaD.e who. whila ah. "t"ng i"m intenerence in tne anairs oi I other powers, naturally aesire to see every countrV in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, prosperity and the blessings of free I " I Cuban waters nave been instructed, in case i bould become necessary, to spare of bona fide American citizens, and to maintain tbe dignity ol tbe nag. It is hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of that affairs in Cuba may be adjusted in tne spirit of peace and conciliation which has hiUierto guided the two powers in tbeir treatment of such questions. EDUCATION OF AMERICAN YOUTH FOR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE IN CHINA AND JAPAN RECOMMENDED. To give importance and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and Uhina, and to further aid in re taining tbe good opinion ot these people. and to secure to the United States its share of tbe oornrneroe destined to flow between thoaa nations and tbe balance ot the com mercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least tour American youtns in each oi these countries, to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers there. Our representatives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the repre sentatives of Great .Britain and of some other powers. As now situated, our ren- resentatives in Japan and Uhina have to . . . . . - depend lor interpreters and translators upon natives oi tnose countries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the'services of employees in foreign business houses, or the inter preters to other foreign Ministers. I would also recommend liberal measures tor the purpose of supporting the Ameri can lilies of steamers poy plying between San Francisco and Japaq and China, and the Australian line, almost our only re maining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their service. THE NATIONAL DEBT to extent of eighty- six millions, fifty-seven thousand, one nundred and twenty-six dollars and eigh ty cents during the year, and by the ne gotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for interest accounts is nearlv i v vii vuum Miuiivuo vi uvj seventeen millions of dollars less than on tne firBt of March, 1869. It was highly dssirabla that this ramddiminnt. inn ahnnM I take place, both' to strengthen Ihecredit 0f the country and to convince its citizens of r, enure apuity io meet every dollar of wituout oanarupung mem. DIMINUTION THE BURDENS OF TAXATION. But in view of the accomplishment of deairable ends, of the rapid develon. mett of the reaoureea of tha enuntrv ii. jncreasiog ability' to meet large demands and the amount already paid, it is not de- ajraWe (hat the present resources of the country should oontjnue tp he taxed in or- der to continue this rapid "payment. J therefore recommend a modification ot both tho tariff and internal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from internal somrees be abolished, except those collec ted from spirituous, vinous and malt liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and for stamps, in readjusting tne tana, l suggest that ft careful estimate be made of I the amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing for current expenses of the government, the interest account and a sinking tunc, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. there are many articles not produced at home, but which enter largely into general consumption, I tnrougn articles wmcn are manufactured at home, such as medicines compounded. etc , etc., irom wnicu very nine revenue is derived, hut which enter into general use. All such artistes I recommend to be placed on the tree list. bnouid a lurtber reduc tion prove advisable, I would then recom mend that it be made upon those articles wbicb can best bear it, without disturbing home production or reducing the wages oi the American laborer. 1 have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat what will be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. 

SALARIES OP COLLECTORS OF CUSTOMS. The present laws for collecting the rev enue Dar collectors of cu-toms small sala ries. but provide for moieties or .shares in all siezures, which, at the principal ports of entry particularly, raise tbe coin pens t ion of tbese ornciais to a large sum. Jt has always seemed to me as it this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possession ot these offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods enter ed, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this a -carrying 

GOLD AND THE CURRENCY. The continued fluctuations in the value of gold, compared with the national cur rency, has a most damaging effect upon tne increase ana aeveiopniem oi tne coun try, in keeping up prices of ail articles necessary in -every day lne. it losters a spirit of gambling prejudicial alike to na tionai morals and the national nnances. If the question can be met as to how to give a fixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformly approach- ing par with specie, a very desirable oh ject will be gained THE ARMY. For the operations of the army in the nastvear. the expense of maintaining it. the estimates for the ensuing year, and for continuing sea coast and other infbrove ments conducted under tbe supervision of tbe W ar Department, 1 reler you to tbe accompanying report of the Secretary of War. 1 call your attention to the provi sions of the act of Congress approved Marcn 3d, loov, wmcn aisconunues pro motions in tbe Btaa corps of tbe army until provided for bv law. I recommend that the officers infeach grade in the staff corps be fixed, and that whenever the number in any one graae ians Deiow tne number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled bv promotion lrom the grade below. 1 also recommend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant, tbe place may be tilled by selection from the corps in which tbe vacancy exists THE NAVY. The report of the Secretary of the Na vy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency ot the naval force, without material increase in the expense ol sup porting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and is being ex tended as fast as material will admit, ot using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By this means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising grounds, to visit more freauentlv the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable, and generally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace, with out exceeding the numbers ot men or tne expenditures authorized by law. 1uring tne past year tne navy nas, in auuiuon to its regular service, supplied the men and officers for the coast survey, and, and has completed the surveys authorized by Con gress of the Isthmus of Darien and Tehu an tepee, and under like authority has sent out an expedition, completely luraisueo and equipped, to explore the unkuown ceau of the North. The suggestions oi the report as to the necessity lor increas ing and improving the material of the navy, and the plan recommended for re ducing the personal of the service to a peace standard by the gradual abolition ol certain grades of officers, the reduction ol other, and the employment of some in the service of tbe commercial marine, are well considered, and deserve the thoughtful at tention of Congress. I also recommend that all nromotions in the navv above tbe rank of Captain be by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in the hieher grades greater efficiency, and hold out an incentive to young officers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their proleasion. lne present cost oi maintaining the navy, its cost compared with that of the preceeding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year are con tained in the accompanying report of the Secretary of the JNavy. THE 

POSTAL DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the Postoffice Department, as shown by the accompany ing report of the Postmaster General, ex hibits a gratifying increase in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the growth of education and of the pros perity ot the people, two elements nigniy conducive to the vigor and stability of re publics. With a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, but all re quiring the services of the mail, it is not at present to be expected that this De partment can bemaaeseii-su8taining; but c ji JTi;j T .t!j C1 I jr 40 wuiwuuu v", - j, .not far distant when the Postoffi.ce Department of the Government wil prove a much greater blessing to tbe whole peo ple than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaf ter General for improvements in tbe Department presided over by him, are earnestly .recommenaea to your special attention. Especially do 1 recommend the favorable consideration of the plan for uniting the telegraphic system ot tbe United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a coarse the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well if not better ren dered. It would secure the further ad van tage of extending the telegraph through portions of the country where private en Urprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above all, tbe efforts to bring a people widely separated into a commu nity of interests, are always benefitted by a rapid intercommunication ; education, the grand work of republican institutions, encouraged, by increasing the facilities to get the news speedily from all parts of the country. Tbe desire to reap the ben efits of such improvements will stimulate education. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of the operations of last year, and for com parative statements of results with former years. THE 

POSTAL DEPARTMENT. THE KU-KLUX LAW-ITS ENFORCEMENT. There has been imposed upon the Exec utive branch ol tbe Uovernment the ex ecution of the act of Congress, approved April 20, IfifO. and oommqnly Ifuowq a the Ku Kim law, in a portion, of the State of south Carolina. The necessity of the course pursued wfu be demonstra ted by the report of the committee to in vestigate Southern outrages. Under the provisions of the above act. L issued a proclamation, calling the attention of the people ot the United States to the same, and declaring my reluctance tq exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in case of im perative necessity, but making knows my purpose to exercise such powers, whenev er it should become necessary to do so, for the purpose of securing to all citizens of tne United States tne peaoeiui enjoyment of the rights guaranteed to them by the constitution and tne laws. Alter tne pass age of this law information was received from time to time that combinations of the character referred to in this law exist ed and were powerful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in cei 1 11 counties in the State of South'Caro lina. Careful investigation was made, and it was ascertained that in counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient por tion of the citizens to control the local authorities, and having among other I things the object of depriving the eman- I oinated class of the substantial benefits of freedom and of preventing the free politi- ca' actions of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views. Among tneiF operations were frequent scourging and occasional assassinations geaeraUy perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all case being citi- zensof different political sentiments from their own, or treed persons who bad shown disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well-disposed citizens were tbe suffer- ers by this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the 12th of October, 1871, ft proclaraa tion was issued, in tbe terms of the law. calling upon the members of those combi nations to disperse within five days, and to deliver to the Marshal or military offi cers of the United States all arms, ammu nition, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used by them for out their unlawful proposes. This warning not having been heeded, on the 1tn ol Uctober another proclamation was issued, suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties in that State. Direction was given that within the counties so designated persons supposed, upon creditable information, to be members ot sucn uniawtul combina tions should he arrested by the military forces of tbe United States and delivered to the Marshal, to be dealt with according to law. In two of said counties. Yoik and Spartanburg, many arrests have been mane, at the last account the nuraber-ot psitsoRs thus arrested was one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred, whose criminality was ascertained t be of an inleriur degree, wt-re released for the pres ent. These have generally made confess ions of tbeir guilt. Great caution has been observed in making these airesU.and notwithstanding the large number, it j believed that no innocent person innw in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial, m the judicial tribunals of the United blates. As soon as it appealed that the authDrities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures toi enforce the law, many persons absconded. ana inese is gooa grounds for supposing that all of such persons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Con gress by the Attorney General. of the as see. of in 1 of us of THE MORMON QUESTION. a of barbarism, repugnant to civilization, to decency, and to the laws of the United States. Territorial officers, however.have been found who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equality, and with a due sense of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither polygamy nor any oth er violation of existing statutes will be permitted within the territory of the Uni ted States. It is not with the religion of the self-styled Saints that we are now dealing, but with their practices. Thev will be protected in the worship of God, according to the dictates of their con sciences, but they will not be permitted to violate th laws under the cloak of re ligion. It may be advisable for Congress to consider what, in the execution of the laws against polygamy, is to be the status of the plurality wive3 and their offspring. The propriety of Congress parsing an en abling act, authorizing the territorial leg islature of Utah to legitimatize all chil dren born prior to a time fixed in the act, might be justified by its bumanity to the innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation. THE INDIAN POLICY. The policy pursued towards the Indians has resulted favorably, as can be judged lrom the iimitea time auring wmcn it has been in operation. 1 trough tbe exertions of the various societies of Christians to whom has been entrusted the execution of the policy, and the Board of Commission ers authorized by the law ot April 10, 1So9, many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations, to cultivata the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civilization. They are bcin caved for in such a way, it is hoped, as to induce those still pursuing their old habit j of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. 1 rec ommend liberal appropriations to carry out the Indian peace policy, not only because it is Humane, Christian-like, eco nomical, but because it is right. I rec ommend to your favorable consideration ..1im, the policy of granting a territorial government to the Indians, in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas and Missouri and south of Kansas. D ing so, every right guaranteed to the lmiians by treaty should be secured. Such a course might in time be the means of collecting most of the Indians between the .Missouri and the Pacific and 8uth of the British posses s ons into one Territory or one State The Secretary of the Interior has treated uion this subject at length, and I recommend to you this suggestion. THE PUBLIC LANDS FOR ACTUAL SETTLERS ONLY. I renew mv recommendation that the public lands be disposed of only as requir- I ed for occupation and to actual settlers. I Those already granted have been, in great I part, disposed of in such a way as to se I cure access to the balance by the hardy I settler who may wish to avail himself of I tbem : out caution snouia oe exercisea even in attaining so desirable an object. Educational interests may well be served bv the grant of these reads and the sale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as recommending in the least degree a curtailment of what is be ing done by the General Government for the encouragement oi education. BUREAU REPORTS. The report of the Secretary of the Inte rior. submitted with this, will give you all the information collected and prepared for publication in regard to the census fatten during the year 1S70, the operations of the Bureau of Education for the year, the Patent Office, the Pension Office, the Land Office and tbe Indian J3ureau. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. j The report of the Commissioner of Agri culture gives the operations of his depart ment lor the year, as agriculture is tne groundwork of our prosperity, too much importance cannot be at ached to the la bors of this department. It is in the hands of an able head, with able assistants all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the nation all suoh products adapted to any of the various climates and soils of our yast ter ritory, and to giving all useful informa tion as to the method of the cultivation of the plants, the seed and other products adapted to peculiar localities. Quietly but surely tha Agricultural Bureau is working a great national good, and if lib erally supported the more widely its' in fluence will be extended and the less de pendence shall be upon the products of foreign countries. COMPENSATION OF OFFICIALS. The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus, and officials holding po sitions of responsibility, and requiring ability and character to till properly, is an to whioh your attention is invited But few of the officials receive a compen sation equal to the respectable support of a lam.ly, wnne tneir auxien are sucu aa to involve millions of interest. In private life services demand compensation equal to the services rendered. A vise econo my would dictate the same rule in the Uovernment service. THE ESTIMATES FOR ENSUING YEAR. I have not given the estimates for the support ol the government W tag ensu ing yeaf, nor the coroparaUyti st&tefuent between the expenditures lor the year just parsed and the one just preceding, because all tbese figures are contained in the accompanying report, or in those pre sented directly to CongrebS. Theae esti mates have my approval. THE QUESTION OF AMNESTY. LJorp than six years the last hostile gun was fired between the armies then arrayed against each other one for the perpetuation, tbe other for the destruction of the Union it may well be considered whether it is not now time that tho disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment should not be removod. That amendment does not exclude the ballot, but only, imposes the disabilty to hold office upon certain classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not ste the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office, merely because they were, be fore the rebellion, of standing and charac ter suffloient to be elected to positions re quiring them to take oaths to support the Constitution ; and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely the same views, but of less standing in their com munities, it may be said that tho former violated in oaths while tha latter did not have it in their' power to. do so If they had taken this oath, it cannot be doubted they wou d have broken it, aa did the former clasa. U there are ny great crim inals distinguished above all others for the part they took in opposition to the government, thep might, in the judgment Congress, be excluded from inch an am nesty. This subject is submitted for yonr careful consideration. The condition of Southern States is nnhappily not such all true patristic citizens would like to Ostracism for opinion's sake, threats personal violence toward persons enter taining political views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, prevents immigration and the flow of much needed capital into the States lately in rebellion. It will be a happy condition of the country when the old cit izens of these States will take an interest public affairs, promulgate ideas borestly ntprinlnr1 pnta f, , i- mi v..-. , - - " w ... v. (cpic.ciibUI) their views, and tolerate the same freedom expression an4 ballot in those enter taining different political convictions. Y. I. ; Rice, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Under the provisions of the act of Con gress, approved February 21, 1871, a ter ritorial government was'organized in the District of Columbia. Its results have thus far fully realized the expectations of aavocatea. under the direction of the territorial officers, a system of improve ments has he'en inaugurated, by means which Washington is rapidly be coming a city worthy of the nation's cap ital. The citizens of the District having voluntarily raxed itiemselves to a Inrgn amount for the purpose of contributing to the arra'ig-mnt of the ieat of govern ment, I reoinna'-nd several appropria tion on tbe part of Congress, in ordr that the guvi-muieiit ni iy bear iis just share of the expense of carrying out a ja dicious system of mi jrov-ement. GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN CHICAGO' By the great fire in Chicago, the most important of the government buildings of that city were consumed. Those burn ed had already become inadequate to the wants of the government in that growing city, and, looking to the near future, were totally inadequate. I recommend, there fore, that an appropriation be mad.t im mediately to purcoase the remainder of the square on which tbe burned buildings stood, provided it can be purchased at a fair valuation, or provided that the Legis lature of Illinois can pass a law authoriz ing its condemnation for government pur poses; aua aiso an appropriation ot as much money as can properly be expended toward the erection of new buildings dur ing this nscai year. Y Y. Ills. ler, B-ck. C; ury the tho of by to PROTECTION OF IMMIGRANTS. The number of immigrants ignorant of our laws, habits, c, coming into our country annually has become so great, and the impositions practiced upon them so numerous and flagrant, that I suggest Congressional action for their protection. it seems io me a iair subject ot legisla tion by Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire the natnre of the com plaints made by immigrants of the treat ment they receive, but will endeavor to do so during the session of Congress, par ticularly it tbe subject should receive your attention. HONESTY AND EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC OFFICES. It has been the aim of the administra tion to enforce honesty and efficiency in all public offices. Every public servant who has violated tbe trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the vigor of tne law. If bad men have se cured places, it has been the fault of the system established by law, the custom of making appointments, or the fault of those who recommend for government po sitions persons not sufficiently well-known to them personally, or who give letters indorsing the character of office-seekers without a proper sense of tbe grave re sponsibility which such a course devolves upon them. A civil service reform,' which can correct this abuse, is much desired In mercantile pursuits, tbe business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally re sponsible for the integrity of his friend and bis ability to meet bis obligations. A reformatory law, which would enforce this privilege against all endorsers of per sons for put lie place, would insure great caution in making recommendations. A salutary 1-ssen nas been taught the care less ana tne aisnonest public servant in the great, number of prosecutions and con victions of the laat two years. It is grat ifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout tbe coun'ry in b'-inging to punishment those who have proven recreant to tbe trust confided-to th-in. and in elevating to pub lie ofhee none bui those who possess the confidence of the hunest an 1 virtuou who will always be found to comprise the majority oi tne community in wmcn they live, THE CIVIL SERVICE BOARD. my message one year ago, 1 urgently recommended a reform in the civil service of the country, in con formity with that recommendation Con gress, in the ninth section of an act mak incr appropriations for sundnr civil ex pends of the Government and for other purposes, approved March 3d, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Executive to inaugurate a civil ssrvice reform, and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so. Under the suthoritv of said act I convened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified for the work, to devise rules and regulations to enect tbe 'needed reform. Their labors are not yet completed, but it is believed that they will succeed tn devis ing a plan which can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, the heads of department and members of Congress, and which will redound to the true inter est of the public service. At all events the experiment shall have a fair trial. I have thus hastily summed the opera tions of the Government during the last year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your consideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined action will be wise, statesman like, and in the best interests of the whole U. S. GRANT. EXECUTIVE MANSION, December 4, 1871. 42D CONGRESS—2D SESSION. SENATE. Washington, December 4. The Sen ate met at noon with nearly a full atten dance.
