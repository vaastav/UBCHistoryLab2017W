Treasury Secretary Urges ! , Congress to Deny Every Appropriation for Expen diture In New Fields. : ' Washington; Dec. 3. No appre ciable reduction in' taxes for the next fiscal year is to be thought of, Secretary Glass declared in his an- iNial report sent today to congress. Government receipts mugt be kept at their present figure, he said,, in J order to bring government borrow- i S to an end. 'racing expenditures estimated aj -$5,629,486,359 for the vear ending June 30, 1920. and $4,473,696,358 for the year ending June 30, 1921, the government ' must enforce rigid economy. Mr. Glass, declared. He placed the deficit for tlie -current year at $3,905,000,000 and for the year ending June 30, 1921, at -ap-' proximately $2,005,000,000. Oh this basis, Mr. Glass urged congress , to deny "every appropria tion for expenditure in new fields." He said the same policy should ob-t.-.in until the government had its ' sinking fund well under wav and re payment of the war debt "satisfac-' torily begun." . Foreign Relations Discussed. Relations between conditions in Kuiope and those in the United States were discussed also by Mr. Glass. '.He said that, undoubtedly, - there was a very great need in Eu rope for financial assistance, but that the' situation had been much ; exaggerated. i , . .'We must all feel deep sympathy lor Europe today," he said, "hut we inustnot, allow our- sympathy to warp ""oti judgment and, by exag gerating European financial needs, make them more difficult to fill. . , . . The problem of financing Europe belongs largely to the ex porter because industries cannot be i reopened without, raw stocks. Gov ernment financial assistance in the past and talk of future government or banking aid to finance exports have apparently led. our industrial . concerns to the erroneous expecta tion that theiy" war profits, based, largely on exports, will continue in definitely without any risk on their 1 parti 'To them will "fall the 'profits of exports and upon them will fall the consequences of. failure to make the exports." ' - The treasury-, will continue its policy, in effect since the armistice, to restore private initiative and re move governmental control and in terference with respect to the na tion's foreign trade, Mr. Glass said. ? Only through this means, he argued; .could a "healthy economic ,&c be v gained."' He added that removal of any influence by the government should provide the incentive for American comm Vce to go into the world, markets and establish itself. Ratification of the peace treaty will measurably stimulate export trade, Mr. Glass declared, because opera tion of the - past would eliminate ' numerous political risks and provide ' a suref investment basis., 1 w" .'Military Gets Most.

Universal Service presents herewith the third and final installment of the most sensational expose of German se cret diplomacy on record, the sum mary of documents unearthed and compiled for the German govern ment by Deputy Kautsky. though suppressed in Germany In the opening chapter of the revelations it was shown how the kaiser, two days after the assassina tion of the Austrian archduke, at Sarajevo, wrote now or never on the margin of a note ser-t by the German ambassador at Vienna tell ing of the feeling there that there must be a reckoning with Serbia, Jottings on the margins of these documents in the War lord s own handwriting, show how he planned and ordered the mobilization of Germany's naval and military forces to . prepare for the coming of war and berated the "civilian chancellor' for not comprehending the idea of his movements. , The kaiser personally was with trie uerman fleet and viciously re buked his chancellor for questioning his actions with the navy. Declared England Mobilized. The chancellor's message said the British navy was not taking any un usual measures contrary to the carrying out of dispersal after the maneuvers. On this the kaiser com mented the British navy had no need of taking extraordinary measures. since it was ready for war and mobilized. - ' ' . Ihe chancellor urged that since Sir Edward Grey, for the moment anvway. had not prepared to inter vene in a European war, the kaiser might be well advised not to give any premature orders, for the return of the fleet. I he kaiser remarked "If Russia mobilizes, my fleet must already be in the Baltic so it's Koinsr home." On July 27 the kaiser returned' to tferhn. Count Szoegyeny telegraphed to Count Berchtold regarding a state ment by Chancellor von Bethmann- Hollwesr. . "The secretary of state,"" so the count's message ran, "informed roe in strict confidence very ernphat icallv that durinir the next few days mediation proposals on the part of England might perhaps be commu nicated to your excellency Dytne German covernment. in connection with wlnVti the latter offered the ab solutely unqualified assurance that it did not identify itselt with such pro posals but that, on the 'contrary, it was decidedly opposed to their con sideration and that it would trans mit tlem merely to conform with the English request." Urged Immediate War. In Vienna, meantime, Count von Berchtold drew up a memorandum for the ( Austrian emperor urging immediate declaration of war on Serbia, in viey of Pashitch's (Ser bian premier) "skillfully worded" note, in order to forstall arfy at tempt' by the triple; entente to se cure a peaceful settlement. ' Count Berchtold sent this mem orandum to the Austrian emperor at Bad Ischl, with a draft of the pro posed declaration of war in which specific references v were made to acts of hostility by, Serbian troops near Temeskubie, on the Danube. On the morning of July 28, the Serbian reply was communicated to the kaiser at Neues Palais in Pots dam, and upon his copy of this doc ument he wrote: "A brilliant performance for a time limit of 48 hours. This is more than could be expected a great success for Vienna. Herewith .every ground - for war , disappears and Giesl (the Austrian minister to Ser bia) might quietly have stayed at Belgrade. It would' never have or dered mobilization on the strength of this." f At 10 that same morning, the kaiser indited a .lengthy note to Chancel lor "Von Bethmaun-Hollweg in which he urged that While Serbia had ostensibly capitulated the Ser bians were "Orientals" and, there fore, , "liars." Consequently, he went on, it was necessary to apply "douce violence" to them in order to guarantee the fulfillment df the Serbiaiuassurances. Above all the kaiser said in his note to the chancellor, some "satis faction d'honneur" was due to the Austrian . army which otherwise would have mobilized three times without having anything to show for it. S ' Temporary Occupation. "If your excellency shares my view," the kaiser added, "I suggest that Austria' be told that Serbia has been compelled to withdraw and jve offer our congratulations on this re sult. We should further say, of course, that a state of war no long er exists, but at the same time a guarantee is needed for-the fulfill ment of the Serbian promises. This guarantee presumably can be se cured by temporary occupation of n part of Serbia, just as we in 1871 left troops stationed in France until the milliard (indemnity imposed by Prussia on France after the Franco Prussian war) was paid. ' "On this basis I am readv tn mt- 'diate peace with Austria. Any pro- posals in a contrary sense-Q pro- tests from other quarters I should unconditionally reject, all the more so since everybody is1 more or less openly appealing to me for help to maintain peace." i' ... The German chancellor thereupon telegraphed to .Tschirschky (Ger man ambassador at -Vienna), point ing out that the' Serbian reply was conciliatory and that lest- public opinion in Europe be antagonized, Austria ought clearly to define her aims. It was absolutely imperative, the chancellor added, that the odium tor an eventual world war should fall upon Russia. . Fifteen gypsies, men and women, boys and girls, fled from the custody of Police Officer Robert P. Samar dick after he had oorraled them with five other gypsies near Thirteenth and Douglas streets yesterday after noon. The five Samardick was able to retain were taken to Central po lice station and charged with va grancy. Samardick was acting under the general order of Chief of Detectives Dunn to "clean out" 'the band of gypsies that had infested lower Douglas street and .ether points about the city and the South Side. . He took Carmen John. Steve John. Eli Yaiiko, Adolph Yanko and Tom Thompson from a fortune telling room at 518 South 1 enth street. On his way to the police station with them he raided 203 South Thirteenth street and took l.i more pt the gypsy clan.

After exhaustive discussion Wed nesday -of the recommendations made by President Wilson, in his message to congress arid a tenta tive program prepared by Herbert Hoover, vice chairman, with the assistance of other delegates, the conference decided that means .for peaceable settliMneiiN of industrial disputes should head the list of work to be done. The subject will have numerous divisions, incl'iding es tablishment of a permanent tribunal to maintain industrial peace, - all of which will be studied from every, ingle before the final 'report is ready.! The conference -will require sev cral weeks at least t complete the If Russia did not acquiesce in the patroi the 15 pewcomers deserted occupation (by Austria) of Belgrade and other points as a guarantee, the chancellor continued, "European public opinion would swing definite-J-iy against her." The chancellor cautioned Tsch irschky "carefully to avoid giving rise to the impression that we desire to restrain Austria." "The point is," continued von Bethmann-Hollweg, "simply; to find a line of procedure Which will ren der possible the desired aim of Aus trianamely, to sever the vital nerve of greater Serbia propaganda without at the same time pro voking a world war, and which pro cedure, if such a war should ulti mately prove inevitable, will as far as possible improve for us the con ditions under which it will have to be waged." Berchtold Dictated Declaration. Emperor Francis Joseph signed the declaration of war upon Berch told's , dictation. But upon his re turn fo the ballplatz (seat of the Vienna foreign office) Berchtold deleted from the document signed by the emperor the references to Serbian acts of hospitality. The declaration of war, thus ab breviated, arrived in Nish at 1:20 p. m. At 9:40 that night Berchtold received from Ambassador Szoegy eny at Berlin), information to the effect that the German government had declined the "inopportune" British proposals for a conference in 'London. Herr Kautsky then recounts the now generally known exchange of telegrams between the kaiser and the czar, and also Prince Henrv's letter, wun the report of a promise of King George that the latter would try to keep British out of the conflict. ; - On July 29 the kaiser conferred with his leadinsr generals and chan cellor at Potsdam. Growing furious over the inability to insure British neutrality, he5 penned a memoran dum t the chancellor attacking, the Ingush, i The czars suggestion, contained in his second telegram, that the whole matter be referred to the Hague tribunal, was rejected bv the chancellor after it had been shown to the, kaiser. This telegram was concealed trom the uerman people. un July ju, trom 6 m the after noon, .Bethmann-Hollweg became profundly impressed with the pros pect that in the event of war Eng land and Italy might make common cause with France 'ancf Russia. So hV began to make frantic efforts to induce Berchtold to accept Grey's offer of mediation. He ureed Tschirschky to represent to the Vi enna government that it the latter refused to exchange views - with .Petrogfad it would become almost impossible to impute to Russia the responsibilitysfor the war which was then already threatened. ' ' Inflame Mohammedan World. The kaiser meanwhile penned a further memorandum to the .chan cellor charging England, France and Russia had seized upon the Austro Serbian conflict "as a pretext to em bark on a war of destruction against us: that is to say, that we rriust either shamefully betray our ally, thereby breaking the triple alliance, or, for our loyalty to our ally sub mit to being chastised by the whole triple7 entente." " This," the kaiser added, "is the true, naked situation, initiated by Edward VII and . completed , by George V. "Edward VII. is dead, but he is still. stronger, in his grave than J, who am live." , , The kaiser further declared in his memorandum: The machinations must be laid bare. We. must inflame the Moham medon world into a savage uprising f we are to bleed to death, r-ng.- land (at. lest) must lose India." At 9 in the evening ' Chancellor Hollwee sent a fresh telegram to Vienna uring the Austrian govern ment (through the German ambas sador), not to provoke suspicion him and took refuge on a Council Bluffs street ' car.
