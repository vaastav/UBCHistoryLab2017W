2 THE VERMONT PHOENIX, BRAT jL jEBORO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1893. i THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, Annual Statement of Our AH'nlrs. The WNnii Tariff Hill Fully Endorsed. Mr. Clurlnml Would ltestnre the lln vvitllnn (liirrn Pension) Oie Pns, Of fice llrimrliitriit! tlir liiillntix. Ktc. The message opeii9 with the usual re view of our relations with foreign countries. These are amicable ami satisfactory with no serious exception. An impartial atti tude has been maintained in regard to the rebellion now In progress in Brazil, and there has seemed to bo no occasion to rec ognize the insurgents, who consist of the officers, men and vessels of the navy, so far as active operations are concerned. It is believed that, under the recent amendment to the Geary law, Chinese la borers In this country, who refused to com ply with the law last sprlnc, will avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of acquiring a legal right to remain here, and the necessity for enforced depor tation will thereby be avoided to a great extent. The Nicaragua canal company has be come financially embarrassed, and has been compelled to suspend work, but the Presi dent earnestly hopes that this great enter prise may bo completed eventually under American auspices. In response to urgent protests made by out government the Turkish government has made, or promised to make, reparation for the work of a mob In that country in attacking and partly destroying Anatolia college, established at Marsovan by citizens of the United States, and also for attacks on our missionaries, who are doing legiti mate work in Turkey. With regard to the Hawaiian question the message says : llav nil. It Is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused serious em barrassment. Just prior to the installation of the present administration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation liad been negotiated between the provisional government of the Islands and the United States, and submitted to the Senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination, and despatched James H. lilount of Georgia to Honolulu, as a spe cial commissioner, to make an impartial investigation of the circumstances attend ing the change of government, and of all the conditions healing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaus tive examination, Mr. lilount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that govern ment, and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our min ister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me that the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that bad been done by those repre senting us and to restore as far as practica ble the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention. With a vie- of accomplishing this result within the constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations and responsibility growing out of any changed conditions brought about by our unjustifiable interference, our present min ister at Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no in formation of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received from him. Additional advices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly sent to Congress, together with all information at hand, accompanied by a special execu tive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of" all the material events leading up to the pres ent situation. Arbitration. Great Britain has responded favorably to the resolution of Congress, declaring that all differences between nations ought to be settled by arbitration. illllllt-lnl Mutter. The amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was larger than in any pre vious year In the history of the govern ment, amounting to S-lOS.tiSO.-J-l, and ex ceeding the amount exported during the preceding year by $5S,-4S."i,ol7. The sum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty was fi),;17."),130.8S, an increase over the preceding year of -J,0;!3,0j3.00. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the gov. eminent for the j-ear ending June 00, lt0-l, will be S"430,121,o(w.P.S; and its expendi tures $-15K,l:ll3(l.'.::; resulting in a de ficiency of $28,000,000. The purchases of silver under the law of July 14, 1800, during the last fiscal year, aggregated 54,O0S,ltlJ.5i) fine ounces, which cost $45,S31,u74.,"3. The total amount of silver purchased from the time that law became operative until the repeal of its purchasing clause, on the first day of No vember, 1803, was 108,074,500.-10 fine ounces, which cost $irri,030,040.84. It is estimated that on the first dayof July, 1803, the metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin aVid bullion, amounted to S-l,'213,.")0,100, of which ?vj07,007,OS."i was gold and ftil.1, S01.4S4 was silver. One hundred and nineteen national bauks were organized during the year ending October 31, 1803, with a capital of $11, L'30,000. Forty-six went into voluntary liquidation and 1.18 suspended. Sixty-live of the suspended banks wero lnsolvent,80 resumed business, and seven remain in the hands of bank examiners, with prospects of speedy resumption. The total number of national banks in existence on the 31st day of October, 1803, was 3700, having an aggregate capital of $005,558,120. The net increase in the circulation of these banks during the year was $30,380,072. Till- Silver tlurstliili. The repeal of the silver purchase law has made an entire change In the complex Ion of our currency affairs, and I do not doubt that the ultimate result of this action will be most salutary and far reaching. In the nature of things, however, it is impos sible to know, at this time, what supple mentary legislation may prove to be essen tial or expedient. When, however, through restored confidence, the money which has been frightened into hoarding places Is re turned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a permanent sound cur rency, abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing population and business. In the pursuit of this ob ject we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedients, deter mined to be content with nothing less than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In these circumstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay In dealing with this subject will Increase the probability of wise action. Tlir War Department, The secretary of war reports that the strength of the army on the 30th day of September last was 2.1,778 enlisted men, and 2144 officers. The total enrollment of the militia of the several states was, on the ' 31st of October of the current year. 112,507 officers and enlisted men. The officers of the army detailed for the Inspection and Instruction of this resent- of our military force repoit that increased interest and marked progress are apparent in the dis cipline and efficiency of the organization. Neither Indian outbreaks nor domestic violence has called the army Into service during the year. Tlir Clilrkniuntign llnllli flt Id. The work on the projected Clilckaniauga and Chattanooga national military park has been prosecuted with zeal and judg ment, and its opening will be celebrated during the coming year. Over nine square miles of the Chickamauga battlefield have been acquired, 2.1 miles of roadway have been constructed, and permanent tablets have been placed at many historical points, while the invitation to the states to mark the positions of their troops participating in the battle has been very generally ac cepted. The work of locating and preserv ing the lines of battle at the Gettysburg battlefield Is making satisfactory progress on the plans directed by the last Congress. I'o.t-orllt r Irinrtinrnt. The business of the mails indicates with absolute certainty the condition of the business of the country, and depression in financial affairs Inevitably and quickly re duces the postal revenues. Therefore a larger discrepancy than usual between the post-office receipts and expenditures is the unavoidable result of the distressing strin gency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessor that the deficiency on June 30, 180."., would be but a little over a million and a half dollars. It amounted, however, to more than five mil lions. The post-office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $7-1,800,033.10, and Its expenditures to $-U.074,101.HO. This post-office deficiency would disappear or be immensely decreased if less matter was carried free through the malls, an Item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. The total number of post-offices in the United States on the 30lh day of June, lf03, was 08,403, an increase of 12S4 over the preceding year. Of these 3300 were presidential, an increase in that class of 204 over the preceding year. I am decidedly of the opinion that the provisions of the present law for the free delivery of mails permit as general an in troduction of this feature of mail service as is necessary or justifiable, and that it ought not to be extended to smaller com munities than are now designated. There are now connected to the post-office estab lishment 2.",324 employes, who are in Un classified service. The head of this great department gives conclusive evidence of the value of civil service reform wheij, aft er an experience that renders his judgment on the subject absolutely reliable, he ex presses the opinion that without the benefit of tills system It would be impossible to conduct the vast business intrusted to him. I'rlittlmtH. On the 30lh day of Juno, 1803, there were on the pensiou rolls 000,012 names, an increase of 80,044 over the number on the rolls June 30, 1802. Of these there were 17 widows and daughters of lleolutionary soldiers, 80 survivors of the war of 1M2, 542.1 widows of soldiers of the war, 21,518 survivors anil widows of the Mexican war, 3S2 survhors and widows of Indian wars, 2.4 army nurses, and 475, (U.I survivors, and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sail ors of the war of the Iiebelllon. The lat ter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 1MI3, who were pensioned under the act of June 27, IsOO, which allows pensions on account of death and disability not charge able to army service was 4.10,155. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123,104, and the number dropped was 3:1,000. Although the law of 1M0 permits pen sions for disabilities not related to military service, yet as a requisite to its benefits a disability must exist, incapacitating appli cants "from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support." The execution of tills law in its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true intention, but toward the close of the last administration an authoritative construc tion was given to the statute, and since that time this construction has been fol lowed. This has had theeffect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pen sion roll by means of wholesale and gigan tic frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthor ized, pending a complete examination, giv ing notice to the pensioner!), in order that they might have an opportunity to estab lish, if possible, the justice of their claims, notwithstanding apparent invalidity. This, I understand, is the practice w liich lias for a long time prevailed in the pension bu reau; but after entering upon these recent investigations the commissioner modified this rule, so as not to allow, until after a complete examination, interference with the payment of a pension apparently not altogether, void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than that authorized by law. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Kvery name fraudulently put upon these tolls is a wicked imposition upon the kind ly sentiment in which pensions have their origin; every fraudulent pensioner lias become a bad citizen; every false oath In support of a pension has made perjury more frequent, and undeserving pensioners rob the people not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war, fought for the preser vation of the Union, ought to inspire. Thousands of neighborhoods have their well-known fraudulent pensioners, and re cent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pen sion frauds, liy no means the least wrong done Is to brave, deserving pensioners, who certainly ought not to be condemned to such association. Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should not be accused of enmity or indif ference to the claims of honest veterans. The sum expended on account of pen sions for the year ending June 30, 1803, was 150,740,407. 14. The commissioner estimates that $10.1,000,000 will be requir ed to pay pensions during the year ending June 30, 1804. The Indiana. Our Indians number about 248,000. Most of them are located on 101 reserva tions, containing 80,110,531 acres of land. About 110,000 of these Indians have, to a large degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands in severalty have been allotted to 10,000 individuals, the allotments during the last fiscal year amounting to about 100, 000 acres. The number of Indian govern ment schools open during the year was 105, an Increase of 12 over the preceding year. The total number of Indian children en rolled during the year as attendants of all schools was 21,138, an Increase of 1231 over the enrollment for the previous year. I am sure that secular education and moral and religious teaching must be Im portant factors In any effort to save the In dian and lead him to civilization, I be lieve, too, that the relinquishment of tribal relations and the holding of land in sever alty may, in favorable conditions, aid this consummation. It seems to me, however, that allotments of land In severally ought to be made with great care and circum spection. If hastily done, before the In dian knows its meaning, while yet he has little or no idea of tilling a farm and no conception of thrift, thero Is great danger that a reservation life In tribal relations may be exchanged (or the pauperism of civilization, instead of its independence and elevation. Tlir Agricultural Dipnitmrlit. On the 7th day of March, 1803, there were upon the pay rolls of this department 2480 employes. This number has been reduced to 1850 persons. In view of a de pleted public treasury, and the Imperative demand of the people for economy In the administration of their government, the secretary has entered upon the task of ra tionally reducing expenditures by the elim ination from the pay rolls of all persons not needed for an efficient conduct of the affilrs of the department. The regulations of 1802 concerning Tex as fever hae been enforced during the last year, and the large stock yards of the country have been kept free from Infection. While contagious pleuro-pnetimonia in cat tle has been eradicated, animal tuberculosis, a disease widespread and more dangerous to human life than plcuro-pncumonla, is still prevalent. Investigations have been made during the past year as to the means of its communication and the meth od of its correct diagnosis. This work ought to be extended, in cooperation with local authorities, until the danger to hu man life arising from this cause Is reduced to a minimum. The agricultural exports show a falling off of about 25 per cent from the preced ing year, the decrease occurring entirely In the last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due to an increase in the price of American export cattle. Tlie exports of acrlcultural products from the United Males for the fiscal year eniiing.iune ;i, imij, attained the enor mous figure of $00.000,000 in round num bers, being 7.7 per cent of our total ex ports. In the last fiscal year this aggre gate was greatly reduced, but, neverthe less, reached Mtl.l.OOO.OiK). being 75.1 per cent oi an American commodities export ed. Kliiirmiiiia DUlriliiillim uT St-ril. Under the sanction of existing legisla tion there was sent out from the agricult ural department during the last fiscal year enough of cabbage seed to plant 10,200 acres of land, a" sufficient quantity of beau to plant 4IKK) acres, beet seed enough to plant 2.100 acres, sweet corn enough to pi mt 7800 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2025 acres with vines, and enough muskmelon anil watermelon seeds to plant 2075 acres. The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was contained in more than 0.000,000 packages, and they were sufficient, if planted, to cov er 80,500 acres of land. In view of these facts this enormous ex penditure, without legitimate returns of benefit, ought to be abolished. Anticipat ing a consummation so manifestly in the interest of good administration, more than $100,000 has been stricken fiom the esti mate made to cover this object for the year ending June 30, 180.1; and the secretary recommends that the remaining $3.1.000 of tlie estimate be confined strictly to the purchase of new and improved varieties of seeds and that these be distributed through experiment stations.. t'lill Srrvlre ltrftirm. The continued intelligent execution of tlie civil service law and the Increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gr.Uifing. Tlie recent extension of its limitations ami regulations to tlie em ployes at free delivery pot-o!lices, which lias been honestly and promptly accom plished by the commission, witli the hearty cooperation of the potmaler general, is an immensely important advance in the usefulness of the system. 1 am, if possi ble, more than ever convinced of the in calculable benefits conferral by the civil service law. not only in its effect upon the public service, butao, what Is even more important, in its effect in elevating the tone of political life generally. The course of civil service reform in- this country in structively and in erestingly illustrates how strong a bold a movement gains upon our people which has underlying it a senti ment of justice and right, and which at the same time promises better administration of their government. The law embodying this reform found its way to our statute book more from fear of the popular senti ment existing in its favor than from any love for the reform itself on the part of legislators, and it has lived and grown and flourished in spite of the covert as well as open hostility of spoilsmen and notwith standing querulous impracticability of many self-constituted guardians. Beneath all the vagaries and sublimated theories which are attracted to it, there underlies this reform a sturdy common-sense princi ple not only suited to this mundane sphere, but whose application our people are more and more recognizing to be absolutely es sential to the most successful operation of their government, If not to its perpetuity. Tariff Hi fin in. After a hard struggle tariff reform is di rectly before us. Nothing so Important claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents itself as both an opportunity and a duty an opportunity to deserve tlie grat itude of our fellow citizens and a duty im posed upon us lw our oft-repeated profes sions and by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full discussion our country men have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have confided tlie work of Its ac complishment to the ban Is of those who are solemnly pledged to It. If there is anything in theory of a repre sentation in public places of the people and their desires, if public officers are real ly the servants of the people, and if polit ical promises and protestations have any binding force, our failure to give the relief so long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort until this reform Is accomplished by wise and careful tfrzm&s folk 

CHICAGO. . I FOR INFANTS' FOODS. f legislation While wo should stanchly adhere to the principle that only the neces sity of revenue jiwtlfles the Imposition of tariff duties and other federal taxation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we catinoi close our eves to the fact that conditions have grown up among us which In justice and fairness call for dis criminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as the emergencies of our government actually demand. Manifestly, if we are to aid the peo ple directly through tariff reform, one of its most obvious features should be a reduction In present tariff charges upon the necessaries of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be palpable and substantial, seen and felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions of a govern ment whose highest function is the promo tion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our people's prosperity and well-being Is the removal of restrictions upon the Importation of the raw material necessary to our manufact ures. The world should be open to our national Ingenuity and enterprise. This cannot lie while federal legislation through the Imposition of high tariff, forbids to American manufacturers as cheap materi als as those used by their competitors. It Is quite obvious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured products re sulting from tills policy not only confines the market for these products within our own borders, to the direct disadvantage of our manufacturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labor are certainly, though indirectly, Involved In this feature of our tariff system. The sharp competi tion and active struggle among our manu facturers to supply thellmlted demand for their goods soon fill the narrow market to which they are confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills and fac'.ories, a discharge of employes, and distress .in the homes of our workingmen. Even if the often disprovixl assertion could be made good, that a lower rate of wages would re sult from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the Intelligence of our workingmen leads them to quickly disc iver that their steady employment, permitted by free raw materials, is tlie most important factor in their relation to tariff legislation. Tlir Xevr Tallir Hilt. A measure has been prepared by the congressional committee, embodying tariff reform on the lines herein suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative action. It is tlie result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I hvlieve it deals with Its subject consistently and as thor oughly as existingcomlitlons permit. I am satisfied that the deduced tariff duties prc vided for in the proposed legislation, added to existing internal reenue taxation, will, in the near future, though perhaps not im mediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. The committee, after full consideration, and to provide against a temporary defi ciency which may exist before tlie business of the country adjusts itself to the new tariff schedule, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corporite investments. These new assessments are not only abso lutely just and easily borne, but they have the further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable business dis turbance whenever the necessity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only lie attained by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform, and as a result of their willingness to subordinate person al desires and ambitions to the general good. The local interests affected by the proposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all are insisted ujion tlie leg islation embodying the reform must inevi tably fail. riiiiii'. In conclusion, my intense feeling of re sponsibility impels" me to invoke, for the manifold interests of a generous and con fiding jx-ople, tlie most scrupulous care, and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the advancement of the greatness and prosperity of our beloved country. Gniivtit Ci.i:vi:i.axh. Executive Mansion, Washington, Dec. 4, 1803. A HemiM-ratlf Opinion. From tlie Ne York Sun J In what he has to say about the reform of the tariff, Mr. Cleveland recognizes "the emphatic verdict of the people," but he is very careful not to say what that emphatic verdict was. There is not a word about the constitutional limitations on tlie taxing power of the government, as affirmed by the Democratic platform on which he was elected. The generalities and half-truths and solemn nothings which are so charac teristic of his rhetorical stvle. are emnloved No hide tlie naked Iniquity of his proposi tion that the platform shall be repudiated by the party, and that the Democracy shall now engage in the construction of an avow edly protective tariff, differing from the MeKinley tariff in the degree of Its Me Kinleyism, but not in kind. . . . The personal note sounds as usual throughout the message, swelling in the last paragraph to an impressive acknowledgment of the President's "intense feeling of responsibil ity," not only for his own share in the management of tlie nation's affairs, but also for the doings of the Congress. A I'rolilrm in .tlnlliriuaf iia. From the New York Tribune Mr. Cleveland does not seem to grasp the meaning of the treasury reports which he submits. Regarding these, lie says that the estimated revenue for the cutrent year falls short of estimated expenses by $38, 000,000. As the decrease in revenue for only five months has been over $31,000,000, the statement seems singularly out of place in such a state paper. The present tariff law, under Democratic conduct, yields less by about $70,000,000 yearly than it did last year, and the proposed tariff will cut off, according to Chairman Wilson, about $50, 000,000 yearly from last year's revenue. It is not to tlie President's credit that he avoids the problem thus presented.
