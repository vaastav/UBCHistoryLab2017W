The Senate. opening scenes?floral tributes to senators? i the body promptly proceeds to BUSINESS. Many of the Senators were present in the cham- j ber to-day sometime before the hour of noon, and the exchange of pleasant greetings, comparison of I notes about the past fall's campaign, and other subjects kept up a perfect buzz of conversation in the chamber. As Is usual on the first day of a session, everybody was In good humor. The chamber, with the handsome new carpet lately laid, new chairs and desks, freshly Jvarnlshed, wore a bright and cleanly appearance. Some of the desks were decorated with floral tributes, which added to the pleasant surroundings. Senator Voorhecs was the* favorite among the senders of boquets. lie had no less than three on his desk. The prettiest was a mammoth horseshoe, composed of rare flowers. There was also a large boquet and a handsome collection of flowers, inclosed In fine straw, made Into the shape of a shock of wheat. Mr. Logan's desk was almost covered with a bank of flowers, having his Initials in blue, set In a surrounding of white flowers. Senators Ingalls and Lnpliam were also the recipients of tributes of this kind. Immediately after the prayer, the usual committees to wait on the House and the President wrere appointed. Business was then proceeded with, in its proper order, the sometime custom or taking a short recess after the appointment of committees to visit the House and the President, that Senators might employ the recess for handshaking, being omitted. This was a manifestation of the business s-plrit with which Congress meets, the all-prevailing Idea being that every moment must be utilized. After disposing or documents on the Vice President's table, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of bills on the calendar, under the Anthony rule. In all the history or Senate proceedings seldom has such promptness been displayed in getting down to the work of the session. regular record of proceedings. The Senate was called to order at noon by the President pro tem. Senator Davis, of Illinois. After prayer by the Chaplain, the customary resolutions were adopted for the appointment of committee!} to notify the President and the House of Representatives respectively that tho Senate had convened and was ready for business. The President pro tem submltte*4he reports of the secretary, the sergeant-at-arms, and the finance clerk of the Senate, which were laid on the table. A resolution to print 20,000 copies of the report of the tariff commission was referred to the committee on printing. Mr. Harris (Tenn.) presented memorial of the board of health of Memphis, approving the action or the national board of health, and asking adequate appropriations to sustain the ejime, which as ordered referred to the committee on epidemic diseases when appointed. On motion of Mr. Conger (Mich.), the testimony taken by the Joint committee on blilpplng and navigation was ordered printed. new bills. Bills were Introduced and referred as follows:? By Mr. Hale?To relieve ships and vessels from compulsory pilot fees; referred to the commutes on commerce. To Increase the number or Judges ! of commission of the Alabama claims from 3 to 5; referred to the committee on Judiciary. By Mr. Hill?To provide for coinage at the branch mint at Denver; referred to the committee on finance. By Mr. Miller (by request)?For the relief of the Continental and other fire insurance companies of New York; referred to the committee on claim?. B/ Mr. Voorhees?To regulate the Jurisdiction of federal courts in cases against railroad corporations while in th? hands of receivers; referred to th? * emmlttee on Judiciary. Granting a pension of $50 a month to the widow of Rear Admiral Scott. Referred to the committee on Derisions. j At the conclusion of the morning hour the Senate proceeded to the consideration of the calendar under the Anthony rule, which requires that bills and resolutions on the calendar not objected to shall be taken up In their order, and restricts each senator t > a single speech of flve minutes upon each question. I A bill upon the calendar providing for the reinstatement of Wm. Beebe, Jr., in the army, with the rank of second lieutenant, was taken up, and the memorial and other papers were read. Mr. Edmunds was unable to see any substantial distinction between this case and the cases of other gentlemen who had lert the army for civil life. The bill proposed to take one case out of 125 similar ones and make It an exception. Mr. Sewell (as a member of the committee on military afTalrs) explained that this gentleman might have taken a second lieutenancy under the act of 1870, but preserred not to do so; and remarked that Congress had heretofore made many similar exceptions to the general rule. - I Mr. Edmunds admitted such action by Congress and condemned It. He was opposed to tills kind of special legislation and in favor of a Just general rule. He knew that this kind of talk was not very likely to have much effect, though there was some reason for supposing thatconslderable dissatisfaction exists throughout the country about something or about everything that Congress had done of late. i After some further discussion the bill, on motion of Mr. Edmunds, was Indefinitely postponed. At l o'clock the Senate, on Motion of Mr. Allison, took a recess for half an hour. the president's message. At 1:30 the Senate was again called to order. Mr. Anthony, from the Joint committee appointed to wait upon the President, reported that the committee had performed that duty, and that the President would immediately communicate with both houses In writing. The President's secretary then appeared and delivered the message, which was read. 1 House of Representatives. the opening pr0cebdin68 to-day. In conse quence of the unresclnded order of the last session, fixing at 11 a. m. the hour for the daily assembling of the House, the second session of the 47th Congress of that body was to-day opened by the Speaker at that hour. The galleries, though not crowded,were comfortably filled and on the floor the bustling throng of members engaged In friendly greetings and In exchanging Jocular remarks in reference to the recent election. The appearance of the chamber Is not changed, the same dingy carpet covering the floor, though the revarnlshlng of the desks tends to make the hall loox somewhat brighter. The desk occupied, during the last session by the late Representative Uptiegraff, of Ohio, was tastefully dressed In black and ornamented with a basket of flowers. In his opening remarks the chaplain of the House alluded to the deaths of Representatives Lowe and UpdegrafT, and gave thanks that the others mombers had been preserved during the recess in health and prosperity. The Speaker then formally declared the session opened, and the clerk proceeded to call the roll of I members. The call disclosed the presence of 92 members. NEW 

MEMBERS SWORN IN. The following named gentlemen were then sworn In as members of the House, to fill vacancies: R. R. Hltt, of Illinois, to succeed Mr. Hawk; Seaborn Reese, of Georgia, to succeed Mr. Stephens; Chas. M. Shelley, of Alabama, to succeed himself. Mr. Calkins (Ind.) presented, by request, a memorial against the swearing la of Mr.,Shelley, but asked for no action beyond the reference of the memorial to the committee on elections; which was done. Mr. Moulton (111.) presented a petition from John P. Calne, claiming to be elected as a delegate from Utah. Referred to the committee on elections. A resolution was adopted providing for the appointment of a commlttec to Inform the President and the Senate that the House is now re.idy to proceed to buslnesa the tariff commission report. The Speaker laid before the House the report of the tariff commission,-and Mr. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, moved Its reference to the committee on ways and means. [The report Is submitted In manuscript, making a very voluminous documentor about 2,000 pages.] Mr. Cox, of New York, Inquired whether It was a complete report. ?Mr^KeUey.?It Is a finished work. Mr. Cox.?dlacfcargathe commission? Mr. Kelley.?That Is the of the commission. The secretary leaVes Washfflgtrs 4b-day en route for Europe. Mr. Cox.?I am very happy to bear 1L {Laughter.] I Tne report was referred to toe committee on ways and means, and ordered printed. Mr. Ryan, from the committee on appropriations, reported the Indian appropriation bill, and It was referred to the committee of the whole. nbw bills introduced. The Speaker then, as the regular order, proceeded to call the states for bills, which were Introduced and referred as follows: By Mr. Herbert, of Alabama?Further to protect executive ami employes o? tifce* ustted Washington News and Gossip, Government receipts To-day.?Internal revenue, 1722,437.90; customs, 1647,628.33.

"None whatever," replied the Senator. "Most of the members elected to the legislature as antl- | monopolists, are republicans, and will vote for a republican Senator." I Senator Van Wyck could not undertake to say ?hin<r^0,ih* ie ?}ecte<1' but he said that such a thing as the election of any but a republican was not thought of in his state. SenaRSS a candidate for re-election, also sail to the reporter that for the election of Senator the republicans will have all the votes they need in the Nebraska legislature. ? ? ?

There was a ripple of excitement about the rooms occupied by the Garfield fair committee at the Capitol, about li o'clock this morning.' Mrs. M. A. Butler, the founder and manager of the Aom in's Labor Exchange and Co-operative store, had an interview with Gen. Swalm and Col. Corbln, which resulted in the lady leaving the office in a rather excited state, It being said that the gentlemen threatened to have her removed by a policeman. I Mrs. Butler, It appears, visited the rooms for the purpose of obtaining articles left over at the fair for the benetlt of the exchange.

The successor of Hon. Aleck Stephens looks very much like ex-Senator Gordon.of Georgia. A curious coincidence, too, Is the fact that Mr. Stephens as Governor of Georgia certifies to the election of his own successor. The wreck of the Garfield monument fair is being cleared away to-day as rapidly as possible. Up to late this afternoon all of the portable exhibits had not been removed, and the stationary fixtures had not been touched. The House committee on the District of Columbia Is called to meet on Thursday next. Quite a number of members of Congress were remembered by their lady friends with handsome boquets. The desk of ex-Representative Updegraff, of Ohio, was draped In mourning, and upon it was placed a boquet of immortelles. The employes of the office of Sergeant-at-Arms Hooker of the House this morning presented him with a magnificent boquet of azellas and other rare exotics. THE 

REPORT Or THE TARIFF COMMISSION, as well as the Commissioners,reached Washington yesterday. The report -was to-day transmitted to the Speaker of the House. It te a voluminous document and makes some Important recommendations on all artlclesjof general consumption. The report recommends a reduction of 25 per cent. The commissioners are somewhat surprised to find that the report had been prematurely printel In a New York newspaper in advance of its receipt In this city. the presidential succession. Senator Lapham, of New York, said to a Star reporter to-day that he sincerely hoped Congress would at this session pass some law definitely settling the question of the presidential succession. Said he: "I think the bill pending in the Senate to place the members of the Cabinet in the line of succession Is the best yet offered for the solution of that question. The passage of that bill would render a special session of the Forty-eighth Congress unnecessary. You see, unless we pass some Taw of this kind, a special session must oe called, as without It there will be no Speaker of the House, no President of the Senate, and the lire of President Arthur only would stand Detween the country and such anarchy as would ensue from the aosence of any occupant of the executive chair. Now the bill I have spoken of not only provides amply for the succession, but It would perpetuate thd* policy of the administration, as Cabinet officers generally understand and are in sympathy with the policy of the executive whom they serve." the nicacragcan canal project. It Is the Intention of the projectors of the Nlcauraguan canal to push that matter with industry a 1 this session of Congress. Their bill, obligating tlr* government to guarantee 8 per cent Interest on $75,000,000, Is set for the special order in the Senate on the 12th instant. Captain Phelps, of this city, has returned, and will devote his attention to pushing this bill this winter. civil service reform. The House to-day, by almost a unanimous vote, assigned the 12th Inst, to the committee on civil service reform to report some bill looking to the reform of the civil service, the order to continue after the 12th from day to day until the subject is disposed of. Mr. Cox (N. Y.) made a witty speech, congratulating the republicans that they had at last woke up to a realizing sense that reform in the civil service is needed,

MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT. fto the Senate and Uousr qf Rrirre*entati*rf of tht United Statex It Is provided by the Constitution that th- President shall from time to time glee to the Confreei Information ot the state of the Union, and reoocnmend to their consideration such measures as hi shall Judge necessary and expedient In reviewing the event* of the year whMi has elapsed since the commencement of your s. sstons, I first call your attention to the gratifying condition of our foreign affairs. Our Intercourse with other powers has continued to be or the mast friendly character. Such "lltrht differences as hare arisen during the year have been already settled or are likely to reach an early adjustment. The arrest of cltlssna of the I nlted States in Ireland under recent laws which owe their origin to the disturbed condition of that country has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with the government of Grsat Britain. A disposition to respect our rights has been practically manllested by the release of the arrested parties. The claim of this nation In regard to the super, vision and control of any Inter-oceanlc canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the sub> Ject of conference. It Is likely that time will be more powerful than discussion In removing the divergence between the two nations, whose friendship is so closely cemented by the Intimacy of their relations and the community of their Interests. Our long-established frtcndlluess with Russia hRs remained unshnken. It nas prompted me to pr< ffer the earnest counsels of this government that measures be adopted for suppressing the pro. scrlptlon which the Hebrew race In that country has lately suffered. It has not transpired that any American citizen has been subjected to arrest or Injury, but our courteous remonstrance has nevertheless been courteously received. Thereto reason to believe that the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to secure toleration to all faiths within her borders. At an International convention held at Paris In I?8?: attended by representatives of the I nlted States, an agreement was readied In respect to the protection of trade marks, pr.tented articles, and the rights of manufacturing firms and corporations. The formulating into treaties of the recommendations thus adopted Is receiving the attention which it mert?~&. The protection of submarine cables Is a subject now under consideration bv an International conference at Paris. Relieving that It isH ariy the true policy of this government to favor the nout munition of this means of Intercourse, 1 requ< sled our minister to France to attend the convention as a delegate. 1 also designated two of our eminent scientists to attend as our representatives at the meeting of an international committee at Pans, for considering the adoption of a common unit to measure electric force. In view of the frequent occurrence of conferences for the consideration of important ma iters of common interest to civlllz d nations, 1 resbectfully suggest that the Executive be inv<-st??d by t'ongress with discretionary power to send delegates to such conventions, and that provision be made to defray the excuses incident thereto. The difference between the I*nlted stabs and Spain as to the effect of a Judgment and oeri float* of naturalization has not yet been adjusted ; hut It Is hoped aud believed that negotiations now in progress will result In the establishment of the position which seems to this government so reasonable and Just. I have already called the attention of Congress to the fact that in the ports of Spain and Its' colonies onerous tines have lately been imposed upon vessels of the United States for trivial technical offenses against local regulations. Efforts for the abatement of these exactions have thus far oroved unsuccessful. I regret to Inform vou also that the fees demanded by Spanish consuls In American port* *"* * In some cases solirge, when compared with the valu" of the cargo, as to amount In t ff.rt to a considerable export duty, and that our remonstrances in this regard have not as yet received the attention which they seem to deserve The German government has Invited the United States to participate tu an International evhlbltlon of domestic cattle, to be held at Hamburg In July, 1888. If this country Is to be represented. It is Important that,ln the early days of this session. Congress should make a suitable appropriation for that purpose. The death or Mr. Marsh, our late minister to Italy, has evoked from that ^ovornineut exnrem Blons of profound respect for his exalted character and for his honorable career In the diplomatic service or his country. The Italian government has raised a question as to the proprl ty of recognizing in his dual capacity the representative of this country recently accredited both as secretlry of legation and as consul-gcueral at Rome. He has been received as secretary but his exequatur as consul-general has thus fur'been withheld. The extradition convention with Belgium,which has been In operation since 1874, has Wo lately supplanted by another. The Senate has signified Its approval, and ratUlcations have been duly exchanged b"tween the eontrictlng countries. To the list of extradltablecrlrnes has been added that of the assassination or attempted assassination of the chief of the state. Negotiations have been opened with Switzerland looking to a settlement by treaty of the question whether Its citizens can renounce their allegiance and become citizens of the United states without obtaining the consent of the Swiss Government. I am glad to inform you that the Immigration of paupers and criminals from certain of the cantons of Switzerland has substantially ceased and to no longer sanctioned by the authorities. Ihe consideration of this subject prompts tht suggestion that the act of August a, 1S82. which has for its object the return of foreign convicts to their own country, should be so modified as not to be open to the Interpretation that It affects the extradition of criminals on preferred chaftree of crime. # ^ The Ottoman Porte has not yet assented to the * Interpretation which this government has nut upon the treaty of 1830 relative to Its Jurisdictional rights in Turkey. It may well be, however, that this difference will be adjusted by a general revision of tne system of Jurisdiction of the I nlted States In the countries or the east?a subjoct to which your attention has been already called by the Secretary of state. In the interest of Justice towards China and Japan, I trust that the question of the return of tht: Indemnity fund to the governments of those countries will reach, at the present session, the satisfactory solution which I have already recommended, and which has recently been fore* shadowed by Congressional discussion. The treaty lately concluded with Corea awaltn the action of the Senate. During the late disturbance In Egypt the timely presence of American vessels served as a protection to the persons and property of many of our own clt zens and of citizens of other countries, whose governments have expressed their thaukl for this assistance. The recent legislation restricting Immigration or laborers from China has given rise to the question whether Chinese proceeding to or from another country may lawfully pass through our own. Construing the act of May 6, 1882, in connection with the treaty of November 7,1890, the retrlctlon would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrant* coming to the United Slates as laborers, and would not rorbld a mere transit across our territory. I ask the attention or Congress to the subject for such action, II any, as may be deemed advisable. This government has recently had occasion to manliest its Interest in the Republic or Liberia br seeking to aid the amicable settlement of the boundary dispute now pending between that republic and the British possession of ftterrn Leone. The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become terminable utter September 8. 1883, on twelve months' notice by either party. While certain provisions ot that compact may have proved onerous Its existence has rostered commercial relations which It Is Important to preserve. I suggest, thererore, that early consideration be given to such modifications or the treaty as seem to be demanded by the Interests or our people. In view or our Increasing trade with both Haytl and Santo Domingo, I advise that provision be made for diplomatic Intercourse with the latter by enlarging the scope of the mission at Port-aife Prince. I regret that certain claims of American citizens against the government of Haytl have thtm far beeu urged unavalllngly. A recent agreement with Mexico provides for the crossing or the frontier by the armed foroeeoC either country in the pursuit of hostile IndlaM. In my message of last year I called attention te the prevalent lawlessness upon the borders and is the necessity or legislation for Its suppression. I again invite the attention of Congress to the enhJect. A partial relief from these mischiefs has beam sought In a convention, which now awaits the an> (troval of the Senate, as does also another toocn* ng the establishment of the international bonndary between the United States and Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action of Congress will be required for establishing suitable commissions of survey. The boundary dispute between Mexico and Guatemala, which led this government te proffer Its friendly counsels to both parties, has been amicably settled. No change has occurred In our relations with Venezuela. I again invoke your action In the matter of the pending awards against that republic to which reference was made by a special message from the Executive at your last session. An invitation has been received from the goveminent of Venezuela to send representatives in July, 1883, to Caracas, for participating In the centennial celebration of the birth of Bolivar, the founder of South American Independence. In connection with this event it is designed to commence the erection at Caracas of a statue of Washlrttori, to conduct an industrial exhibition whlok will be open to Acrtcan products. I recommend that the United States Dr represented, and thai suitable provision be made therefor.
