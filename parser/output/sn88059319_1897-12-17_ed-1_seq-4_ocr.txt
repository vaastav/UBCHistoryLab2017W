1 It ps? iff*-" fair Y'ik *r$w, Sii mi Secretary Gage to Embody Bis Views in One Bill. 4^ COMMITTEE TO REPORT A MEASURE. 3W1U Embrace Fcnturci Recommend ed by tlie PrcNldcut In 111B MO» rA iage» Senate and House Hold Short Se*Hiou». Washing-ton, Dec. 15. 'Secretary Gage will appear before the house uoiu xalttec on banking and currency on Thursday and submit lo them in the form of a general bill his reccmiinenda Along recently made to congress. The determination 01" Secretary. Gnge .to appear on Thursduy and to submit one general financial bill instead of a number of separate bills, brought out many expressions of satisfaction. It had the effect of clearing up a situation .which was becoming strained, and gave promise of an early report to congress on financial bills. The understanding was reached as a result of a visit to the capitol of the solicitor of the treasury, Mr. Council, representing Secretary Gage. He talked with a number of the republican leaders and, it is understood, was advised by Mr. Dingley and others that it would be desirable to em brace financial subjects in one general bill. Later the solicitor met Chairman 1 Walker and other members of the com mittee on banking and currency, and & general conference was held as to what should be done. It was, made known that Secretary Gage preferred to let the subject go over until after .the holiday recess. The committee urged, however, that it desired to take the Gage bill and also that submitted by the monetary conference under con sideration^ tiring the holidays, in order to be in a position to report progress when the house reconvened after the re cess. It was decided, therefore, that Sec retary Gage should submit his meas ure on Thursday and Appear in person to explain and argue its merits and an swer questions from the committee. It was also made clear that the secretary would cover all his proposals in one genjeral bill, instead of cutting the sub ject up. This arrangement gave gen eral satisfaction, and having accom plished this much, the members of the committee canvassed the course they would take as to making an immediate report to the house on the currency questions. The Committee's Plan. It was decided that the first thing to be done was to report a bill embody ing the three features recommended by .the president, viz.: A reduction of the tax on circulation to one-half of one ... per cent. the issuance of circulation up to the par value of bonds deposited, »nd the establishment of small banks jln rural communities. While these will !be embodied in the Gage plan, yet as (they were specially advised in the president's message it was felt to be advisable to give, the house the oppor tunity of acting on them at once, with put waiting for the report on the Gage [bill. B*or these reasons the full com imlttee will be asked to report on the ', president's plan at once. The draft of A bill has been prepared by Mr. Brosius, of Pennsylvania, and this was given to the solicitor of the treasury, who is to trertnrn it in time for action by t"he com jmlttee, with such suggestions as the (treasury authorities may wish to make. iAs to the comprehensive Gage bill, this end the monetary conference bill will !be gone over with care during the holi days, and as a result of the better feel created members of the banking .and currency committee say there is no further doubt that action will be re ported to the house soon after the holi days. A Bankruptcy Dill. Washington, Dec. 15.—A national bankruptcy bill similar in its sub stantial features to the Henderson Culbertson bill passed by the house last session, will be reported to the bouse this week by the judiciary com mittee. The bill provides for both vol untary bankruptcy and involuntary ^bankruptcy. By its provisions any pne may file a petition and go into vol untary bankruptcy, except a corpora tion. The latter may be forced Into it, but not otherwise. Wage earners, la borers and farmers cannot be forced Into it. All others are subject to in voluntary bankruptcy for certain designated causes. In general these in yoluntory causes relate to fraudulent ronduct on the part of the bankrupt. The clause in past measures providing that a man who permits his commercial paper to go unpaid for 30 days shall be an involuntary bankrupt is eliminated. (Che general effect of the bill is to dis charge the bankrupt of all debts after Jibe estate has been administered and it fias been found that there has been no fraudulent Conduct. The bankrupt measure Is so framed sa to make its administration simple p.nd inexpensive. It involves only two officers, referee and trustee- ,,j Senate. v:i-!Wa8hingt°n, Dec. 15.—The senate was in session just 15 minutes Tuesday, adjournment being taken until to-day out oi respect to President McKinley, who was in attendance upon the funeral ot his mother.

The time of the session was devoted to the consid eration of the legislative, executive and Judicial appropriation bill. It was de cided to postpone the consideration of the item providing for the maintenance pf the civil service commission until titer the other features of the bill had •been concluded. It was apparent from the remarks made that the entire sub ject will be exhaustively debated. There (s seemingly no disposition to curtail ithe discussion, and it probably will not be concluded before the holiday recess. So absorbing is the topic that almost it-he entire time Tuesday, despite the ifact that the consideration of the ques itlon had been technically postponed, (was consumed in debate upon it. Will Not Be Changed. Washington, Dec. 15.—The Dingley [tariff law will not be changed in any of Its custcvns features at the pres-. ftbt MMion of cotutreM, A general im­ derstandlng to this effect has been reached among the republican mem bers of the ways and means committee, who feel that it is most desirable to avoid what is generally known as tar iff tinkering.

IS.—While the family tnd friends and neighbors of the late Mrs. Nancy Allison McKinley were pay ing their last tribute of respect, and while tbe earthly remains were being laid to rest In beautiful West Lawn cemetery at the side of her husband and others of her family who have preceded her over the river of life, all else was abandoned in Canton.

By jthe time the remains arrived at the I church there was no longer possibil I ity of guiningadmission,and the people lined the sidewalks all about the church, waiting for the time when those within had viewed the remains and passed out to make room for them to pass through the church and take a last look at one whom all had loved and admired. The church was beautiful with the wealth of flowers sent by the people of the na tion and with the rich drapery of inournlng with which It had been ar ranged by the officers of the church, The chancel rail and the pulpit was buried in a cluster of flowers and the pulpit proper was entirely hidden by delicate blooms from many hot house*. As a backing to all of the flowers there were drapings and festoons of somber black, caught np here and there by cords and bows of white. The large loft, ordinarily occupied by a chorus choir, was occupied on one side by the officers of the church and on -the other by the clergy of tbe city. 1 The. Presldent. i^' '^. President McjClnley occupied tbe first pew of the central section of the church, directly in front of the pulpit. The same remarkable self-possession char acteristic of his whole life was mani fest on this occasion. He showed no outward evidence of the sorrow he ex perienced In this, his hour of bereave ment. He, with the other male mem bers of the famjly, Bat with uncovered beads, ignoring the old-time custom for church funerals under which thelmme aiute mourners sat during the whole ceremony with heads bowed down and covered with crepe-bound hats.

As the casliet containing the remains fvas tenderly placed in fropt of the shancel rail the Aeoliau quartette, composed of Mesirs. William R. Heed, Thomas J. Malloy, Alfred Baehrens »nd Harry Lawson, chanted "Still, Still with Ihee." Itev. K. P. Herbruck, of Trinity Ueforiued church, whose pas torate in Canton id of the longest in the local clergy, offered a fervent prayer. This was followed by the reading of hymn: "Jesus, Lover of My Soul," I by Rev. Milllgan, of the First Presby terian church, and the singing of the by the quartettes Rev. Dr. Hall, of Trinity Lutheran ihurch, rend a Scriptural lesson from Firjt Corinthians, part of the fifteenth chapter. Former Mayor R. A. Casidy then read the memorial adopted by the S[other oard of officers of the church of which McKinley had so long been a piember, und the quartette sang: "Lead, Kindly Light." Rev. Dr. Manchester, who was a com rade in arms of the president during Jhe war as a member of the famous fwentyrthlrd Ohio volunteer Infen fry and who has been the pastor pf the first M- B. church for some years, de livered an oration in which he dwelt upon tbe character of the departed and ipoke of her as she was known by tbe neighbors and friends in Canton. Ealovr of Dr. Manchester. The eulogy in part was as follows: "I think the first feeling- that conies to us ill to-day li pne of personal bereavement. Bhe whe has pone out from us was a friend. The nation knows her as the distinguished mother we of the home city know her is one whose kindly word and smile hav« jeen a cheer and a benediction to many heart and home. "For her 'the long, long night' has passed. The morning breaks at last But ber place upon this earth will be vacant forever, liers Is unspeakable gain, but turs Is an unutterable loss. It Is given only tow and then to a pilgrim to spend so many rears upon the earth, and she wrought for herself a place In life that can never be Oiled by another. "It Is not given to many to have such trace of life, such perfection of character crowned her whose going out from imong us we mourn to-day. If I were to filQWffhfer of Blrda for Plumage. fa phe.consignment, recently, a feath er dealer in London received 0,000 bird# of paradise, 360,000 birds of various kinds from the East Indies, and 400,000 humming-birds. In three months an other dealer imported 366,398 birds from the East Indies. A Better Way. "If you want a thing well done, why do It yourself," A ridiculous proverb, I vow I The most sensible way Is to find and to pay Some more oompetent man who knowi how. •n't .. jattulMft UM. Indulge In an analysis of her chsraoter, think I would place llrst of all her glorious motherhood. The wisest man said of suab as she: 'The heart of her husband doth safely trust In ber. Bhe will do him good and not evil all the days of her Ufa. ptrength and honor are her clothing and phe shall rejoice In time to coma. She openeth her mouth with wisdom and In her tongue is the law of kindness. Bhf lookcth well to the ways of her household and eateth not tbe bread of Idleness. Iter children arise up and call her blessed. Q!v« her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her In the gates.' "It irorth all the care and trial and sorrow to be worthy of such divine por» tralture as this, and she was worthy of It. Ber motherhood was the crowning glory of ber days. Bhe was, by divine right, tha gentle mistress of her own house. Always tender and true In her loving sympathies, self-poised and sturdy In her personal up rightness. she ruled like a queen over her own home. Tbe law of kindness was the law of her life, and none knew her there but to feel the genial Influence of har pres ence. She might have been a proud mother, but I think no one heard her say so. Her great loving heart throbbed with tenderest anxieties for those whom tbe kind Father had given her and 'her children arise up and call ber blessed.' "Another characteristic of Mother Mc Klnley was her unvarying cheerfulness. When her pastor suggested to her once that the way must be growing brighter as she advanced toward her^ffavenly home, she replied that It had been bright all the way. And yet there had been many bereave ments. Bhe trod for weary years the path of widowhood. "A career that It closed becomes a Arm possession—a completed power. The arch Is imperfect until tbe hand of death has Used the keytsone.' "It Is the end of the Journey that gives character to the way, and now, life's suc cessful journey ended, she rests well. 'TIs hard to part when friends are dear Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear Then steal away, give little warning. Choose thine own time Say not good night, but In some happier clime Bid me good morning." After the singing of "Nearer,My God, to Thee," benediction was pronounced by Rev. Dr. MacAfee, of Columbus, pastor of the Broad Street Methodist church of Columbus, which the presi dent attended while he was governor of Ohio. View the Remains. The lid ot tbe casket was then lifted, and the large congregation, as well as many who bad been unable to gain ad mission to the church, filed past to take a last look at all that was mortal of Mother McKinley. The family and tbe friends entered the carriages and, followed by thousands, proceeded to West Lawn cemetery, where the body was laid to rest in the family lot. This service was preceded by brief private services at the house attended by tbe immediate family and the Wash ington guests. The house services con sisted of a prayer by Rev. Manchester and the reading of the Twenty-third Psalm by Rev. MacAfee. Members of the Cabinet Attend. The members of the cabinet who came to Canton to attend the funeral reached here on a special train over ths Pennsylvania lines at 9:25 in the morn ing, having left Washington at 7:S0at night.
