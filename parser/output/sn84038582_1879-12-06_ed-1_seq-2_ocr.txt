PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of lieprcivntatirc: The members of the forty-bixth congress have assembled in the fust regular session, under circum stances culling for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledgment to the Giv er of a! lliood for the largo and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs Biuce my last annual message to congress are connected with the linanci il opera tions of the government directly affecting the business interests of the country. I congratulate congress upon the success ful execution of tne 

KKSU.MITION act. At the time iixed and in the man ner contemplated by law, Hie notes ot the United Mates began to be redeemed in com. Since the lirst of January last they have been promptly redeemed on lrottuntiiiimi. :ind in all business traiisiu!- tions, public and private, in all parts the country, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The de mand upon the treasury for gold and sil ver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of com ami bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals depos ited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is about 1(),(hk;,(Mio. Tlie re sumption of specie payment has been fol lowed bv a very great revival of business. "With a currency equivalent in value to the monev of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal com petition with other nations in trade ami production. The increasing foreign de mand for our agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our fa vor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last to Nov. to the amount of about S"U,(tl)0,Oofl. Since the resumption of specie payments there has been a marked and gratifying improve ment of the public credit. The bonds of the government bearing only 4 percent, interest have been Bold at or above par, 8utlicient in amount to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemable un der present laws. The amount of inter est saved annually by the process of re funding the delit since .March 1, 1S77, is f 14,l2'.i7.177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the nuinberwf our cit izens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which ma tures in less than two years is S7!U,11, 700, of which isino.iMKVXiO hear interest at the rate of 5 per cent., and the balance is in bonds bearing 0 per cent, interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent, bonds, and Iy the reduction of interest which will thus be effected about ?!1,ooo,Oim) can lie annually saved to the treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to bo paid by the United States further legislation is re quired, which, it is hoped, will be provid ed by Congress during its present session. 

TIIK COIN AUK of gold bv the mints of the United States during the liscal year was $lo,(lsii,!ili'. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the a t tor that purpose, up to Nov. 1, 1sV.i. was l.-.(Hi(),K."il.of which ?12,7(i()..'il I have been issued troni the treasury and aie now in circulation, and SoLViuoiOOiiro still in possession of the government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action hetween the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the rec ognized money of the world leads me to recommend that congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions, which mav well be awaited before attempting further ex perimental measures with the coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon con gress the importance of ..uthorizing the secretary of the treasury to suspend the coinage of .silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the sil ver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus de feat the desired object, w hich isa currency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of the world. Tne retirement from circulation of I nited Males notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contract is a step to he taken in our progress toward a sale and staMo currency, which should be accepted as the policy and the duty of the government and the interest and se curity of tde people of it. Ii m my linn conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money based wholly upon the au thority and credit of the government, ex cept in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the constitution and a viola tion ot sound linancial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war. with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals, was not authorized except as a means of res cuing the coiintiy from imminent peril. Ihe circulation of these notes as paper money tor any protracted period of lime atu-r the accomplishment of this purpose was not contemplated by the framers of the law under which they were issued. 1 hey anticipate! the redemption ami withdrawal of th-se notes at the ear liest practicable period consistent with the aUai!.me(jt ,,f the object tor which they were provided. The policy of the L nited Mates, sieadily adhered 'to from ttie adaption of the constitution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when, from necessity in time or war, debts have been created they have been paid off on the return of jace as rapidly as possible. U ,th this view and for this purpose it .Hn-coiniuHided that the exist ing laws for the accumulation of a sink ing fund suthcient to extinguish the pub lic debt within a limited period he main tained. If any change of the objects or rates ot taxation is deemed necessarv bv congress it is suggested that experience .as shown that a duty can be placed on tan,irCMr,'e W,i,dl wil1 "'hance the pnc of those articles to the consum er, and which w ill add several millions of dollars annually to the treasury I he columned deliberate violation l,y a large number of the prominent and in fluential citizens of the territory of Utah of thelawHot the United Slates for the prosecution and punishment i f iV.Uga iny merits the attention of every d7i.-?rt-nient of the government. ThbUerr lory has a population Millicient to entitle it to admission as a state. This imuoruiit change will not, however, tV?ni K?iS by the country while the diiSnS'uV Utah in very considerate numbers uphold 1 practice which is condemn T'cr mt by the laws of all civilized commi.Ea throughout the world. The C SS Bnppression of the offense was enacted with unanimity by Conres, mow thin seventeen years ago, but has remained antil recently, a dead letter In the terrl torjr of Ulah. because of the peculiar dif ficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among the citi- rena of Utah that the law was in contra vention with the constitutional pruaran tee of religious freedom. This objection Is now removed. The supreme court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of con gress, binding as u rule ot action for all who reside within the territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesi tation in its enforcement. It should be lirmlv and effectively executed. If not suilic'ietilly stringent in its provisions, it should lie amended, and in aid or the purpose in view I recommend that more comprehensive and more searching meth ods for preventing as well as punishing this crime bo provided, if necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoy ments and exercise oi the rights of citi zenship in the territories ot the United States may be withheld or withdrawn from those who oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject. 'line iM.ia TioNS of the past year, though occupied only with state olliccs, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which attend ed them all over the country new and de cisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the pro gress of the country towards a more gen eral and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many top:cs of politi cal concern demand great attention irom our people, both in the sphere of nation al and state authority, 1 liud no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interests of govern ment, however urgent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in de fense of the primary rights of citizenship and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices and all sectional and state attachments. In de manding that all over wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United Stales shall mean one and the same thing and carry with them unchal lenged security and respect. 1 earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be di vided in opinions on other political sub jects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws, aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon congress to supply any delects in these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the coopera tion of the executive and legislative au thorities of the states in this great pur pose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be sel at rest on this par amount question of popular rights, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacilication of the country or retard the general diffusion of prosperity- In a former message I invited the at tention ot congress to the reformation of 

TIIK CIVII. SKKV1CH of the government, and expressed the in tention o! transmitting to congress as early as practicable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the civil ser vice commission. In view of the fac that, during a considerable period, the government of (Jreat linUin has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses, in various particulars analo gous to those presented in this country, and that in recent years the measures adopted were understood to have been effective mid in every respect highly sat isfactory. 1 thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairman of the civil service commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. 1 lie result, lias neeii an eiauo rate and comprehensive report. The re port sets forth the history of the Partisan spoil-svsteui in (ireat ltritain and id' the rise and fall of the parliamentary patron age and of oilicial interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that af ter long trials of various kinds of exami nations, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are. carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have with great ad vantage been established as conditions of admission to almost every oilicial place in the subordinate administration of that country and of Ib itish India. The completion ot the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its prepa ration, ami the omission of congress to make any provision either for the con pensation or the expenses of the com mission, has been postponed until the present lime. It is herew ith transmitted to congress. While the reform measures of another government are of no author ity to us, they are entitled to influence to Hie extent to which their intrinsic wis dom and their adaptations to our consti tutions and social life mav commend them to tuir consideration. The views 1 have heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil ad ministration remain unchanged, except In so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty lioth of ollicers and of the people themselves to cooperate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoil system of appointment to office and of the ollice tenure are now generally recognized. In the icsolutions of the great pai ties, in re ports of departments, in the debates and proceedings of congress, the messages of executives, the gravity of the evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been admitted. To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must be compatible w ith the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essenti 1 in a free state. When the people have ap proved a policy at a national election congress' confidence in the ollicers they have selected and the advisers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be consulted as to the policies w hich it is their duty to carry into effect, is unquestionable. It is eminently prop er that they should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their duties. It hard ly need be pointed out that very different considerations apply to the greater num ber ot those who lill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their respon sibility is to their superiors in oilicial po sition. It is their duty to oliey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and theirpublic ser vice consists in the dischargeof their func tions irrespective of pailisan politics. Their duty is the same, whatever party is in power, and whatever policy pre vails. As a consequence, it follows that their tenure of ollice should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the su premacy of any party, but should be de termined by their capacity to serve the l;ople most usefully quite irrespective of partisan interests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure should also prevail in the apK)inlment, discipline ami removal of these subordinates. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perqui site which may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be ex ercised in the public interest under all the sanctions which attend the obligations to apply the public funds only for public purposes. Every citizen lias an equal right to the honor and prolit of entering the public service of Ins country. The only just ground of discrimination Is the measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most useful to the people, except in cases where, upon just and recognized principles, as upon the theory of pensions, ollices and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past services. Their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal merit is an act of in justice to the citizen as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appoint ing power is held. In the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to provide just and adequate means, es pecially for every department and large administrative ollice where personal dis crimination on the part of its bead is not practicable for ascertaining those (jii.ili lications to which appointments and re movals should have reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to d-ny the opportunity of ascertaining facts up on which the most righti s claims toof- lice depend, but of necessity to discour age all worthy asiiiiMuts 0y handing over appointments ami removals to mere intln ence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gam the ap pointment, and the interest of the people to bestow it upon biin.it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertain ing personal litiicss for ollice must needs be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government. It has long since become impossible . in the great oriices, for those having the duty of nomination ami appoint nl to person ally examine into the individual qualifi cations of more than a small proportion of those seeking ollice, and with the en largement of the civil service that pro portion must continue to become less. In the earlier years of the government the subordinate ollices were so few in num ber that it was quite easy for those mak ing appointments and promotions to per sonally ascertain the merits of the candi dates. Party managers and methods had not then become powen ui agems w co ercion hostile to the free ami just exer cise of the appointing power. A large and responsible part ol the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and clliciencv rests upon the president; and it has been my pur pose to do what is in my power to ad vance such prudent and gradual incis ures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our adminis trative methods satisfactory to a free and intelligent people by a proper exercise of authority. It is in the power of the ex ecutive to do much to promote such a reform, but it cannot be too clearly tin derstood that nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operation on the part of congress and considerate an I intelligent support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally accepted theories of parties ami demand changes in the methods of departments are not the work of a day. Their perma nent foundation must be laid ill sound principles and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Lvery worthy olliccr desires to make bis oilicial action an honor to bis country. Hut ti e people themselves, far more than the.r ollicers in public station, are interested in ii pure, economical, and vigorous a: ministration. Hy laws enacted in lsi! and Hh, ami now in substance incorpo rated in the revised statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the sevenl subordinate grades in the great depart ments was condemned, and examinatioi s as to capacity, to be conducted by the departmental boards of examiners, were provided for and made conditions of ad mission to the public service. Then? statutes are a decision by congress that examinations of some sort as to attain ments and capacity are essential to the well-being of the public service. Tht important questions since the enactment of these laws have been as to the charac ter of these examinations, ami whether oilicial lavor and partisan inilucnee or common right and merit were to control the access to the examinations. In prac tice these examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish to be examined. Oilicial favoritism and partisan inllueiice. as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates very dillicult to resist. As a consequence, the standard of admission fell below that which the public interest demanded. It was almost inevitable, that a system which provided for various separate hoards of examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and more radical change w.is obviously required. In the annual message of December, 1S70, my predecessor declared that 'there is no duty which so much embarrasses the executive and heads of departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on senators and representatives as that of tiuding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and'often not even lit men, lor the public places. The elevation and purti cationof the civil service of the iovern inent will be hailed with approval by the whole people id' the United States." Congress accordingly passed the act ap proved March .'!. 171. "To regulate the civil service of the United states, and promote the elliciency thereof," giving the necessary authority to the executive to institute a civil service reform. Act ing under this statute, which was inter preted, as intended, to .secure a system of just and practical examinations under uniform supervision, a number of emi nently competent persons were selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, pre pared, with an intelligent appreciation of the requirements of the service, the reg ulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in their capacity as a board, have been known as 

TIIK CI VI1.-MCUV ll'IC COMMISSION. Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the commission. It appears from the report of thecominission, siibmitte ! to the president in April, Is7 1, that examin ations had been held iii various sections of the country, and ttiatau appropriation of $J"i,ooo would be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries, in volved in discharging the duties of the commission. The report was transmitted to congress by special message of April is, 1S7I, with the following favorable comment upon the labors of the commis sion : "If sustained by congress, I have no doubt the rules can. after the experi ence gained, lie so improved and enforced as to still more materially benclit the public service, and relieve the executive, members of congress, and the heads of departments from iniluences prejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the meinliers ot the cabinet and their subordinates in the depart ments, and in that opinion I concur.'' And In the annual message of December of the same year similar views are ex pressed and an appropriation for contin uing the work of the commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, and, as a consequence, the active i. 41.1a n.irtmltiulnn wuq autitifinilftfl. 

WUIA Ol 1.1113 VWIII Ulin(i4ui ...... , .. leaving the commission still in existence without the means, therefore, of causing (publications to he tested in any system atic manner, of securing for the public service the advantages of competition upon any extensive plan. I recommend ed in my annual niessagcjof December. 1H77, the making of an appropriation lor the resumption of the work of the coin mission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many embarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres m the executive departments in Washington, and in a number.of the custom houses and the postollices of the principal cities ol the country, with a view to further test, then effects, and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they have heen staled to have been under t he ad ministration of m v predecessor. I think the economv, puriiv and elliciency of the public service would be greatly promoted bv their systematic ini roduct ion. wher ever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the g ivel llllient, together with ample provision for their general supervision, in order to secure consist ency and uniform justice. Reports from the secretary of the inte rior, from the postmaster general, from the postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations have been for some time on trial, and also from the collector of the port, the naval olliccr and the surveyor ol that city, and from the post in islet s and collect' i s in several of the large cities. show that the compet itive system, where applied, has in va rious ways contributed to improve tne public service. The reports show that the resu.ls have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules cannot fail to be id' de cided be fie lit to the s-rvice. The reports of the government ollicers in the city of New Yoik especially bear decided testi mony to the utility of 

OI'HX ( OMl'iniTIV K KXA Ml NATIONS in their respective ollices, showing that these examinations, and the excellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previ ously in the service, ami particularly on those aspiring to promotion. There lias been on the part of these latter an in creased interest in the work, and desire to extend acquaintance with it beyond a particular desk, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised. The ex aminations have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests, and the method of determining the results, and these visit ors have, witlio.it exception, approved the modes employed, and several of them have publicly attested their favorable opinion upou such consideration. 1 deem it my duty to renew the recom mendation contained in my annual mes sage of December, 1S77, requesting con gress to make the necessary appropria tion for the resumption of the work of the civil-service commission. Kconoiny will be promoted by authorizing a moder ate compensation to persons in the public i.BrL'i'M u'lm mav tiei'form extra labor upon or under the commission as the ex ecutive may direct. 1 am convinced that if a just ami definite lest of merit is en forced for admission to the public ser vice and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and partisan and oilicial interference with the proper exercise of the appoint ing power will in a large measure disap pear. There are other administrative abuses to which i he attention of congress should be asked in thisconnectiou. Mere partisan appointments an I the constant peril of removal without cause very nat urally lead to an absorbing and mischiev ous political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with the discharge of oilicial duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elec tions, not without warrant in the view of several of my predecessors in the piesi deiitial ollice directly in accordance with the law of 1S7I, already cited. I endeav ored, bv regulation made on the li-d of .June, 1S77, to put some reasonable limits to such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never, perhaps, be necessary, to deline with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of federal ollicers. lint while their right to hold and freely express their opinions cannot be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the proper discharge of their oilicial duties, nor to use the authority of their ollice to enforce their own opinions, or to coerce tne political action of those who hold dif ferent opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy quite analogous to those which forbid' the use of oilicial power for the oppression wf the private citizen im pose pipon the government, the duty of protecting its otlice.isand agents from ar bitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered ti c practice of making levies for paity pui poses upon the salaries of ollicers ishighlv demoralizing to the pub lic sei vice and discreditable to the eouu trv. Though an olliccr should be as free as" any other citizen to give bis own mon ey in'aid of his opinions orhisparty.be should also be as tree as any other citi zen to refuse to make such gills. If sal aries arc but a fair compensation for the time and labor of the ollicers. it is a gross injustice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an indirect' robberv of the public funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of the present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade ot oilicial life or public employment the pro tection with which a great and enlight ened nation shall regard those who are faithful in its service.
