GREATER NAVY. Always Looked to It as Our First and Chief Line of Defense. .The program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary of the navy is similarly conceived. It Involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out. but It does majte definite and ex- a program whwh has hofre been only implicit, held in the mds of the .committees on naval affairs and closed in the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or for- mally adopted. It seems to ine very clear that It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan . for putting the navy upon a' final footing of strength and efficiency and to "press that 'plan to completion within the next ' fi ve years. We have always- looked to the navy? of ithe country as our first and chief (line of defense; we have always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence' W . be strong', on -the, seas. Tear by yearvwe have been creating a navy which now ranks very high in deed among the na vies of the maritime nations. We should now definitely de: termine how we shall complete what I we have hee-nn 'and how soon. The 'program, to be laid before you contemplates, the construction within .five yfears of ten, battleships, six, battle cruisers. , ten scout .cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen , fleet f '-submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of .this, number, we shall' the first year provide for the construction of two battleships.. fifteen destroyers,, five fleet submarines. twenty-five coast submarines.' .two ; gu n boats and, one hospitalNshipi the second year two- battieships, one scout cruis'er. ten destroyers; , fotir ' fleet ; submarines.' fifteen , coast submarines, one gunboat and one fuel oil ship; the third year two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout era isers. five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma- ? tines;, the fourth year two battleships.

It is also necessary that the number of midshipmen at the Na val academy . at Annapolis should , be increased by at least 300 In order that the force .of officers should be more rapidly added to. and authority is ask , , .1 . . j,,i-c ed -to appoint.

' ' COUNTRY SHOULD : HAVE FINE MERCHANT MARINE. , ;., j ':- " United States Should Be Its Own Car .' ,;. ,..; rier on the' Seas. .' -',' If this full program should be carried out we should have built or building in 1921, according to the estimates of sur vival ; and standards of classification followed - by the general board of the department,- an effective navy consist ing of 27. battleships of the first line, 6 battle cruisers, 25 battleships , of the second line. 10 armored cruisers. 13 scout cruisers. 5 first class cruisers, 3 second class cruisers: IO third class cruisers. 108 destroyers. IS fleet sub marines. 157 coasr sqhtnarines. 6 mon itors, . 20 gunboats. 4 supply ships. 15 fuel ships. 4 transports. 3 tenders to torpedo vessels. 8 vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would be a riavy fitted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. ' But armies and instruments of war are only part of what baa to be con eidered it we' are to consider the su preme matter of national self sufficien cy and security in nil its aspects There are other great matters -which will be, thrust upon our - attention whether we will or not. . There is. foi example. very pressing question -; trade' and shipping involved' in thi great problem of national adequacy It is necessary for many . weighty rea sons of national efficiency and jdevc-i opment that we should have a grea merchant marine. The great merc-hau fleet we once used to make us rich. that great body of sturdy sailors who used to i carry our nag Into every sea. . and who were the pride andvoften the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It is high time we repaired our mistake and, resumed .our commercial Independence on the seas. For it is a question of Independence. If other nations go to war or seek to hamper each other's commerce our merchants, it seems, are at-their mer cy to do with ns they please. We must use their ships and use them as -they determine. We have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own commerce on the seas. Our Inde pendence is provincial, and is only on 'arll and within our own borders. We are not likely to be permitted to use even the ships of other nations In ri valry of their own trade and are with out means to' extend our commerce vf where the doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a situa' tion is not to be endured. It is of capi tal importance not only that, the Unit ed States should be Its own carrier on j ..pendent the spas and enjoy the economic inde- e. which Only an adequate merchant marine would give it. - but also that the American hemisphere as a whole should enjoy a like independ-' enee and self sufficienpy. if it is not to be drawn' into the tangle of 'Euro pean affairs. . Without suchx independ enc 'the whdle'question of' our polit ical unity and self determination, is very seriously clouded and complicated indeed. Moreover, we can develop no true' or effective American policy without ships cf our own not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and car rying much more; creating friendships and rendering indispensable services to all interest on this side the water. They must move constantly back and forth between the Americas. They are the only shuttles that can weave the delicate fabric of sympathy, compre hension.. ; confidence and mutual de pendence 'in which we wish to clothe our policy of America for Americans. The task of building up an adequate merchant marine for America private capital must ultimately under a ke and i achieve,' as it has undertaken and achieved every other like task among ns Jn the past, with admirable enter prise, intelligence and vigor, and it seems to me a manifest dictate of wis-J om that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may stand in the, way of this much to be desired re vival of our old ,; independence and should facilitate-in every possible way tfce building, : purchase and .'American registration of ships. But capital can not, acomplish t this great task of a sudden. ' It must embark upon it by' degrees, as the onnortunltien of trade ! develop. Something must -be done jet'j once, done to open routes and develop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped, done to open the. arteries of trade where the1 currents have not yet learned to run. especially ' between the two American continents, 'where they are. singularly enough.: yet to be created and quickened.; and it is evi dent that only thevgovernment can un derta"ke such -beginnings and assume the initial financial risks. ' When the. risk, nas passea ana private capital De-.-; gins to find Its way in sufficient abun- i. dance into these' new channels the gov ernment may withdraw. But it can; aot ontt to begin'. It should take tho first steps, and should take -them at once.

I recommend these proposals to yon Jor your prompt acceptance with, the more confidence because every month that bas elapsed since the former pro posals were made- has made the ne cessity for such action, more and more manifestly Imperative. That need was then foreseen. , It is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. 1 am not so much interested in the par ticulars of the' program as I am in taking immediate advantage . of the great opportunity which awaits ns If we will but act in this emergency.. In, this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevaiUVand out of it should come an early solu tion of this pressing problem. . 

SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY IN THE PHILIPPINES Recommends Early Adoption of Meas ures Giving Them Fuller Justice. . There is another matter which seems to me to be very intimately associated with the question of national safety and preparation for defense. v That is our policy toward tbe Philippines and the people of- Porto Rico. Our treat ment of them and their attitude to ward us are manifestly of the first con sequence in tbe development of 6ur duties in the world and in getting a free band to perform those duties. . We must be, free from every unnecessary burden or embarrassment, and there is no better way to be clear of em barrassment than to fulfill our prom ises and promote the interests of those dependent on us to the utmost. ?BiUs for the alteration , and . reform of Jhe government of th? Philippines s.nd for rendering fuller political justice to the people of Porto Rico were, submitted to the Sixty-third congress. They will be submitted also to you. "; 1 need not particularize' their details. ' You are most of you already familiar with them. But I do recommend them to your early adoption -with the sincere conviction that there are few measures you could adopt which would more, serviceably clear the way for the great policies by which we wish to make good, now and always, our right to lead in enterprises of peace and good will and economic and political freedom. The plans for the armed forces of the nation which 1 have outlined and for the general policy of adequate prep aration for. mobilization and defense Involve, of course, very large addition al expenditures of money, expenditures which will considerably exceed the es timated revenues of the government. It is made my duty by law whenever l"e esT 1 expenu.rure eceeo. attention of the congress to the fact H BS V v . ' 8 sible for me to suggest. I am ready to believe that it would be my duty to do so in any case, and I. feel particu larly bound to speak of the matter when.it appears that the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the congress of measures- which I my self urge it to adopt. . Allow me there fore to speak briefly of the present state of the treasury and of the fiscal problems which the next year will probably disclose. ; v " ; ., On the SOtii of June last there was an available, balance in the general fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78. Tlie total estimated receipts for the year 1916. on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by the last congress will not be extended beyond its present limit, the 31st of December. 1915.' and that the present duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after the 1st of May. 1910. will be Sfi70.3G5.500; The balance, of June last 'and t?ese estimated rev enues come tberefo.re to a grand total of $774,535,605.78. The total estimated disbursements for : the present fiscal year. Including twenty-five millions for the Panama canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations and $50,000 for miscellaneous debt redemp tions, will be $753,801,000. and the bal ance in the general fund of the treas ury will be reduced -to $20,644,605.78. The emergency , revenue act if contin ued beyond its present time limitation would produce during the half year 4.rn.lntA 1 f L II ong. , The duty of ., per pound A ,r ' ofl sugar if continued would - produce during the two (months of the" fiscal year remaining after the 1st of May about fifteen millions. These two sums, ,mnHnlr tn,.thr tn. nf.ot-r- mu.'

We are ; frequently reminded that there are many millions of bonds which, the treasury is authorized under existing law-40 sell to reimburse the sums paid out of current revenues for the construction of the Panama canal, and it is true that1 bonds ' for the amount of $222,432,000 are now avail able for that; purpose.

But I for one do not believe that the people of this country .approve of postponing the payment of their bills. Borrowing . money Is shortsight ed finance.'. It can'; be justified only When - permanent things are to be ac complished which many generations will certainly benefit, by and which It seems hardly fair that a single genera tion should pay for- The objects we are now proposing to spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the sense that everything wisely done may be said to be. done. ln the interest of posterity, as, well , as in' our own. It , seems to me a clear-dictate, of . pru dent statesmanship and 'frank finance that in what we are now, I hope, about to undertake 'we should pay as we go . The people of the country are entitled to know Just what burdens of taxation they are to carry and to know from the outset now. The new bills should be paid by internal .taxation. , To what - sources,: then.. - shall we turn? This is so -peculiarly a question which the gentlemen of the bouse of representatives are. expected under the constitution to propose an ' answer to that you will hardly expect me to do more than discuss it iii very general terms. We should be following an al most universal : example Of modern governments if we werev to draw tin greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from' the Income taxes. By somewhat lowering the pres ent limits of exemption and the figure ad which the surtax shall" begin to be imposed and by Increasing, step by step, throughout the present graduation the " 4 ,,-. itself, the income taxes as at present apportioned 'would yield Bums sufficient to balance the books of the treasury at the end of the fiscal year 1917 without anywhere making the burden unreasonably ; or oppressively heavy. The precise reckonings are Tully and accurately set out in the re port of the secretary of the treasury which will be Immediately laid before you. And there s are many additional aources of revenue which can Justly be resorted to wlthout hampering the in- dustrles of country or putting any charpre upon individual ex- A V cent tax per gallon gasalme nd naphtha would yield. at , the present estimated production $10,000,000. a tax of 50 cents per horse power on automobiles and internal ex plosion engines $15,000,000. a stamp, tax on bank checks probably $18,000. 000. a tax of 25 cents per ton on gig Iron $10,000,000, a tax of 50 cents per ton on fabricated iron and steel proba bly $10,000,000.'

NATION'S SECRET FOES SHOULD BE CRUSHED. Gravest Danger to Country Cornea' ' From Within Our Own Borders. j I have spoken to you today, gentle- men, upon a' tingle theme, the thr-! ough preparation of the nation to care j for its own security and to make sure of entire freedom to play the impar tial ro!e:in this hemisphere" and In th world -which we all belie Ve to have been providentially assigned to it. l have ; had in my mind no thought of J any immediate ' or particular danger arising out of our- relations "with "other 'nations. : We are at peace with all the j nations of the -world, and there is rea- ! son to hope that no question in con- ! troversy. between this and other ftov-1 ernments will lead to' any serious ' breach' of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attltnde and policy have been and may yet turn out to b. I am sorry to say that the gravest i threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our j. 'f "e citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, bom : under other flags, but welcomed under1 our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of (Amer- -ica, who have poured the poison of dis loyalty into- the very' arteries of our national life, who- have sought to bring the authority and good name of our vernment into contempt, to destroy vur luuus"le? wue"!,w ujousut It ' effective- for. their vindictive pur- promptly make use of processes of law- the -government and: people who naa f' welcomed and nurtured them and. seek were suspicious- of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! But the ugly and Incredible thing has actually come about, and we are witjiout adequate, federal laws to deal with It. I urge j von to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that In doing so I am urging you to do nothing less . than save the honor, and self respect ' of the nation. Such creatures of pas-, sion. disloyalty and anarchy must be ' crushed 'out. They .are not many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the' ' hand of our power should close over . them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality, of the government, they have sought to pry into every confidential trans action of the' government in order to serve interests alien to our own. It is ? possible to deal- with Jbese things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in. which they may be dealt with. I wish that it could be said that only a few men. misled by mistaken senti ments of allegiance to the governments under which they were born, had been guilty 'of disturbing the self possession and misrepresenting the, temper and principles of the country during these days of terrible war, , when it would seem that every man who was truly an 1 American would instinctively make it his duty and his pride to keep the -scales of judgment even and prove hini--self a partisan of no nation but his -own. But jt cannot. There are some men .-among ns ' and many resident abroad who. though born and bred iu the United. States atad calling them selves "Americans, have 60 forgotten themselves and their honor as citizens , as to'pnt their passionate sympathy with one or tho other stde in the great European conflict above their regard for the peace and dignity of the United States.. They, also preach and practice disloyalty. No" la"ws. I suppose, can f reach corruptions of the mind and heart, but I should not speak of others without also speaking of these and ex pressing, the even deeper humiliation and scorn which every self possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel when he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily bringing upon us. 3 !
