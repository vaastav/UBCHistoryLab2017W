Tho trouble Is a discovery by City Hnsl boor Ilosowater that the property supposed to bo transferred to tho city by tho railroad In exchano for streets and alleys, amount InR to 110 lots, Is not all that It at fir (it appeared to ho. A distinct confusion bus fcjocn discovered In ninny of tho so-called titles and nbsoluto Invalidity In others. Quit claims arc Klvrti to Omaha by tho Union Pacific covering property which It ilocs not own, nnd some of the disclaimers avowed nro so conditioned that their ulti mato result would be to contlnuo tho tltlo In the namo of tho railway company, In stead of transferrins It nB nurecd. I'riiltnlily .tllNtitUcn. It Jfl tho opinion of both City KiiKlnror Kosowatcr and City Attorney Connell that nil theso discrepancies uro merely mistakes on tho part of tho railroad representatives 'and not Intentional errors. They think, too, that tho cntlro affair ran bo satisfactorily adjusted to tho city's taste, that tho rail road will consent to all chants sUKijestod end to all additional definition of technical descriptions of property required.

On Thursday Mr. Connell sent him tho contract lor ilual checking tip. Tho next day ho began tho scrutiny of tho Itoms nnd quickly found that Homo of tho property In lots which tho Union Pacific protonded to transfer to Omaha was not owned by tho railroad, tho quit claims offered bolns mero farces. Anothor discrepancy occurred In connec tion with tho Missouri river levee, which tho city Intends to keep. Thcro Iihb been rtlsputo for many ycarH between tho two parties over portions of this, nnd in regard to this contract tho city lias Insisted from tho ilrst that it bo given a quit claim to tho district. In tho preliminary conferences tho rullroad acreed to this, but balked when it came to making out tho papers, falling back upon a proposition to kIvo a disclaimer Instead of u quit claim. In explanation of this tho railroad mou united that they lld not wish to glvo too many quit claims, lor their people In tho east would think that they wore- kIvIub uway too much prop erty.

It pro yldcd for tho exception from tho disclaimer of that part of tho levco given to tlio rail road by tho deed of 1SG3. Mr. Ilosowatcr looked tip tho deed and found that U fiavo tho Union Paclllo tho cntlro levee. This wis conditioned upon tho mnlntonanco of ihn terminal within 11 mllo and o half of tho place. Later, however, tho supremo court decided that tho terminal was in Council llluffs, which Is moro than that dls tnnco away, bo tho deed became void. That was twenty years nco nnd now tho rall- tjroad was about to rovlvo that deed. Tho city cnKlnoor cites anothor oxamplo, JTho railroad gives among others a quit claim to Fourteenth street down through (the main business portion of tho city. Mr, Jtosowator Hays that It was In ISfiC that tho road was given permission to bring Its tracks up through that street. It nover took advantago of this privilege, howovor, nnd has long slnco forfeited tho right, tho city's paving, building nnd other established institutions along there constituting a prior right. Just why tho Union Pacific should wish to glvo n. quit claim to this property Is dlfllcult to understand, In tho opinion of Mr. llosownter, unless It bo to emphasize tho Idea that It onco had a right In there nnd thus to enhance Its privileges upon North Fourteenth street. Yesterday morning the grand Jury began nn Investigation of tho charges of corruption which members of the Omaha Hoard of Education made ogalnst city ofllclals. Robert Smith, member of the Hoard of IMucatlon, asked some time ago that ho bo given nn opportunity to appear before tho grand Jury and tell what ho knew con cerning the charges. Ho testified beforo tho Jury yesterday. Louis Goldsmith, tho owner of property In tho proscribed district, was nlso summoned beforo the grand Jurors. Jettlc Reynolds, Annie Wil son anil several other women who have houses In tho district were called yesterday morning, but most of them were excused and told that they will be required to ap pear beforo tho grand Jury a little later In tho session.
