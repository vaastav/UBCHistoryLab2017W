Pet?. 14.?Secretary Gage will ap? pear before ?he House Committee on Ranking and Currency' on Thursday and submit In the forn of a p.-neral bill his recommendations re? cently made to Conirress. The (?..-termination of the Secretary to submit on.- general financial bill. Instead of a number of ?*?ps?mte bills, brought out many sxpress4?oos of satisfaction. It had the effect of clearing up a situ?t:on which was becomlnir strained, ajid gave promise Of an early report to Om-resa on financial bills. The understanding wan rea??hi ?'? a. a result of a visit to the Capitol by the 'Solici? tor ?'f the Treasury. Mr. Connell, representing Mr. Gage. He talked with a number of the Re? publican leaders, and, it is understood, was ad? vised by Mr. Pingley and others that It would be desirable to embrace financial subjects In one gt aeral bill. Later the Solicitor met Chairman Walker and other members of the Committee on Ranking and Currency, and a general conference was held. It v?as made known that Mr. Gage pre femd to let the :iubject go over until after the holiday i tes? The committee urg.-d, however, that it desired to take Mr. Gages bill, and also that BUl.mltted h y the Monetary Conference, un? der coii.-..d. ratli '? during the holidays, In order lo be In a position to report progr?s*! Whan the il nag reconvened after the recesa it was de ;. therefore, that Mr. Gage should submit | rs on Thursday and appear In person to explain and argue Its merits and anSWi r QUas ti< r.s fr..111 the commute**. It was also made char that the Secretary would cover all bis proposals In one general bill. Instead of dividing the subject This arrange? ment gave g.-neral satisfaction, and. having ac . Lished this, the members of the committee dtpi ussed the course they would take as to mak? ing an immediate report to the House on cur? rency questions. It was decided that the first thing to be done was to report a bill embodying the three features recommended by the Presi? dent?-a reduction of the tax on circulation to one-half of 1 per cent, the Issue of circulation up to the par value of bonds deposited, and the Mtabliahmant of small banks in rural r-ommu* nltli a While these features will be embodied in Ml Gage's plan, yet, as they were specially advised in the President's Message, it was felt to be ad? visable to give the House the opportunity of acting on them at once, without waiting for thi report on Mr. Gage's bill. For these reasons the full eommlttee will be asked to report on the President's plan? at once. The draft of a bill has ben propared by Mr. Broslua of Pennsyl? vania, and this was given to the Solicitor of the Treasury, who is to return It in time for action by the committee with such suggestions as the Treasury authorities may wish to make. Mr. Gape's bill and the Monetary Conference Is-?! 11 will be gone over with care during the holi? day*, and as a -esult of the better feeling created to-day. memb??rs of the Ranking and Currency Committee say there is no fui doubt that a bill will be rer-orted to the House soon after the holidays
