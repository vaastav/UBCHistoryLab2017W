IT IS being told that prices of real es­ tate and residence property in the Twin Cities have lately dropped with a dull thud. That residences of modern con­ struction in desirable locations are offered for cash at prices less than the lots cost. That much business property is paying but a small interest on fhe in­ vestment and scores of stores not paying anything. A visit to the leading hotels shows a Sabbath-like quiet of rest and recreation prevailing there instead of the once inspiring and excited train of strangers and speculators. Every at­ tempt to realize in cash for the greater portion of this over-boomed property only shows more clearly the shrinkage. There are more people in the Twin cities than there is business for them, and many have already left. Not only in St. Paul and Minneapolis are these things observed, bat it is the same in Omaha, Kansas City and other places that have witnessed phenomenal and brilliant growths. The cities are ahead of the country surrounding them. The towns in the Pacific northwest are now only closing up their records of mushroom expansion to await the in­ evitable reaction. There is an outcome to all of this of course, but it will be a slow one and will leaye many indiscreet investors in the lurch, pending its ar­ rival. In the meantime good farming lands in North Dakota are now sold at prices much below their relative value. The first revival of property values will be noted in this kind of real estate. North Dakota stock and grain lands are the best and cheapest on earth. Their steady rise in value cannot be doubted for a moment. The next purchasers of these fertile lands will not be non-producing speculators. The farms will be worked for a profit that has not been possible for years. Th6 prices of farm produce are on the rise as well as the farms. THE impression seems to prevail that Senator Pierce made a pretty strong case of citizenship in his reply to the charges that he paid no taxes, and that he was not a bona fide resident of the state. The senator shows that for 1888 he paid taxes to the amount of $140 on Bismarck prop­ erty and $1*23 for the following year. For 1890 they are about the same as ia 1889. His interests at Jamestown are almost as much, and by the organization of the Jamestown loaning company he brought $1,000,000 capital to the state. He has been paying taxes at Jamestown since 1877. He went out of the governorship in January, 1887, and has never thought of moving from the state since that time. Senator Pierce owns a residence at Bis­ marck which cost six or eight thousand dollars. He has also aided his son Gerald to start a horse and cattle ranch, in which the investment is several thous­ and dollars- After fully disproving the charges of not being a resident or tax payer, the senator says: "I do not believe that any ha man be­ ing who has ever had dealings with me can or will point to an instance of dis­ honesty on my part, and I say in all frankness and sincerity that my reputa­ tion in this respect is worth more to me and my wife and children than any office on earth. For nearly seven years I have been the persistent advocate of North Dakota, her interests and her people. All I have in world is here. I hope 1 have not been a bad citizen. I certainly have not intend­ ed to be. Whether I shall represent the people at Washington is for them to say. But at least I hope it may be vouchsafed to me to live in the state and not be driven out because for two years out of the seven I happened to serve as gov­ ernor of the territory." Six of the principal postoffices of the state yet remain in the hands of demo crate. They are Fargo, Grafton, Grand Forks, Hilsboro, Mayville and Valley City. The terms of office in nearly all of them do not expire for over a year or more. There is a growing sentiment in both parties that as these positions are awarded on the result of politics, their tenure should not extend beyond that of the administration that is responsible for the appointment. President Harri­ son is evidently in accord with this pol­ icy and will follow the advice of leading party men ia this matter. If the demo­ crats win in the next election it is ex­ pected that they will do the same as soon as possible. The position of post­ master in any office of any salary or in­ fluence is certainly not a civil service one. 

ELSEWHERK is published a card relat­ ing to the sensational and criminal charges made against Dr. Harcourt of Steele, Kidder county, some time ago. It will be seen that the accusations made against the character of the doctor are wholly retracted. It is understood that after the first excitement had died out Dr. Harcourt returned to Steele, where explanations followed that convinced the accusing parties of their mistake, and exonerated the doctor, whose friends consider that he has been harshly treat­ ed, and who desire publicity given to the truth which has been sifted from tlje con fusion and exoitement attending the the event. Dr. Hurcourt announces that he will hereafter practice his profession in Bismarck. CANADIANS are quick to foresee the benefits the American tariff bill will con­ fer upon the Americau farmers. Nat­ urally, in the Domiuion, the McKinloy bill is not at all popular, for the old time profits of many articles that have been going into Canadian coffers will now be received by the industrious producer on this Bide. In retaliation Canadian far­ mers threaten to feed barley to their cattle instead of buying western corn, of which that country imports annually some threo million bushels. American traveling men are required to pay a li­ cense in Victoria: and various other measures are being considered to get even. But the American producer is going to be way ahead on the deal. IF Jay Gould gets control of the Union Pacific it will be good-bye im­ provements and railway progress. Gould is the arch enemy of railroad competi­ tion in this country. People living along the Northern Pacific can rejoice that Henry Villard is in power and that his liberal policy is likely to retnaiu not­ withstanding the stock raids on the company. To the observers of the tre mendous business this road is doing there is no warrant for the falling off in its stocks. Through trains are loaded both ways and the cars for hauling out wheat are not to be obtained. The road's business is the largest in its history. THE re-election of President Muir as the chief officer of the Farmers' alliance was complimentary enough forauy body. The platform and resolutions were fervently in line with the national war whoop of the organization, but under President Muir's faithful guidance the North Dakota alliance will not skin alive any other political party, neither will it drop into an abysmal tomb of oblivion. The president and the newspapers will save it from that. The alliance has done well in its choice of chief for lfe!)l. 

WASHINGTON and Oregon farmers are feeling the oppression of the elevator wheat monopoly even worse than their Dakota brethren. The crop in those states is a large one. It is claimed there is an elevator and railroad combine to secure the bulk of it and move it after­ wards. Prices at the principle points are 42 to 43 cents a bushel. The pro­ ducers cannot get cars and the elevators treading upon their necessities are low­ ering the prices until there is nothing left for the farmers. IN the Burleigh county legislative dis­ trict the seats of both members of the house will be contested. On the face of the returns, Ward, rep., and Yegen, ind., were elected. Tuesday Philbrik, de­ feated republican, served notice of con­ test on Yegen, victorious independent, and within two hours Hare, independent, filed a contest against Ward, the repub­ lican elected. These are the only two house contests so far reported. It is said that six seats in the senate will be contested. THE official returns show a total vote in round numbers of 36,500. Johnson received 21,365 votes and Benton 14,830 —Johrson's majority, 6,535 Burke's plurality, 6,439 Allin's majority, 11,696 Flittie's, 1,969 Bray's plurality, 8,054 Booker's majority, 10,236 Spencer's 3, 670 Ogden's, 3,697 Helgesen's, 12,280 Carey's, 12,039. For railroad commis­ sioners, Harmon received 19,058, Walsh 18,590, Slotten 25,531, Low 11,965, Stevens 16,796, Kinde 12,500, and Turner 4,601. EVEKY Twin city newspaper is against Donnelly and will attempt to defeat his election as president of the Minnesota Farmers' alliance. This is because the papers forage on the corporations, who in turn demand the services of the press in insisting that no surplus authority or influence among farmers be rested in the able champion of the alliance. The far­ mers have many foes in the big cities, but none more relentless and powerful than the big newspapers. THE North Dakota legislature is ex­ pected to do something handsome for the World's Fair exhibit. Everybody here is interested, or should be, in obtaining the best display of cereals at the fair. North Dakota can take the honor if she tries. It is thought that 825,000 in addition to whut the railroad companies will con­ tribute will not be an unDrofitable in­ vestment. The appropriation should be made this session iu order to obtain the oest results. THE St. Paul bar has spotted some at torneys who have been instigating law suits, and officiously inter-meddling for a "divy." Cases where lawyers take fees if they win personal damage suits against railroads are the most frequent. The statement is made that this class of at­ torneys is not exclusively confined to Minnesota. Every reputable lawyer de­ clines to go foraging around among the ignorant, vicious, or avaricious for legal business. IN his message President Harrison points with evident pride to the success of the anti-lottery law. The vigor of its prosecution, is, no doubt, a presidential fad. But the president seems to think that himself and congress were responsi­ ble for this moral renovation. It may be unkind to rudely disturb this little fancy but the people of the United States understand that all the credit for the law belongs to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. THE coming democratic house in con­ gress promises to be a gorgeous public benefactor in its way. Every species of free lunch legislation is to be passed, knowing it can never get by a republican senate 

KIHI president. "Anything that anybody wants" will be the democrats' rallying cry until the next presidential election. It is already about decided to pass a free coinage bill. The next move will bo fiass an in't gi\ing every man a mine. 13 lesions buying up about all the sheep offered for sale in Montana, North Da­ kota is furnishing that state feed. The Northern Pacific has made a special tariff rate on hay of 30 couts per hun­ dred from Dickinson to points in Mon­ tana. This is large reduction from the old tariff rate, says the Dickinson Press, and is a matter of considerable interest to that section, as large amounts of hay are constantly being shipped west. 

IGNATIUS DONNELLY desires to be presi­ dent of the Minnesota Farmers' alliance For along time Mr. Donnelly has worked hard for the farmers of his state, and has been a notable leader. The corporations fight him to the death, but he still sur­ vives,—the endurance of brains against force and money and monopolistic skill. The farmers of Minnesota can happily afford to take the Sage, as a flattering unction, to their cause. CONGRESS began its winter term yes­ terday which will close the session March 4th. The general impression pre­ vails that the republicans will not craw­ fish on legislation enacted and planned for future passage. This, with the ex­ ception of the federal election bill, is the only thing to do. The veil before the temple of democratic tariff sophistries will be rent long before two years have expired. PKESIDENT SPRAGUE of the state uni­ versity is a candidate for the United States senate. He takes the position that this office should not be haggled over and obtained by disreputable wire­ pulling. He is a candidate for the high office on a platform of political princi­ ples of equal altitude. His views on this subject are given elsewhere. 

PRESIDENT OAKES assures the public that the Villard management of the Northern Pacific is not endangered by Jay Gould, and that the Kockefellers have no control of the stock. Mr. Oakes says that Villard is stronger than ever in the directory—all of which is good to hear. THE president's message in substance will be found elsewhere in The Alert. It is a straight republican document. It reviews the situation clearly and can not but convince republicans of the strength of the party's position before the coun­ try. It should be read by every citizen. THE North Dakota Sittings is running a big paper now. The Alert is glad to see that it is able to do so—without the lottery ad. A good many papers were nnable to do that with Dauphin's as­ sistance. Editor Sheppard must have made a haul out of the campaign. THE usual incompetency in the Indian department seems complicating the In­ dian "war." The differences between the war and interior department, over the con duct of the campaign may result the nearest approach to bloodshed that has yet been promised. 

STATE AUDITOR BKAY desires to notify all concerned that the joint commission appointed to settle the affairs of the late territory of Dakota will hold their last and final meeting at the capital in Bis­ marck, Dec. 8, next. THE Fargo Sunday Argus contained a great deal of valuable information about North Dakota, given by counties. The facts were creditably and thoroughly presented and the issue ought to have a wide circulation. THE preachers have begun to explain, elucidate, elaborate and punctuate the Messianic craze. The substance of the sermons seems to be that the poor Indian has interpreted the scriptures too liter­ ally. THE official count in the Twenty-sec­ ond legislative district—Eddy, Foster and Wells counties—gives Patch a ma­ jority of 12 over Wellman and Walton a majority of 13 over Sanford. IN his message the president comes out strong for reciprocity. Catarrh Can't lie Cured with
