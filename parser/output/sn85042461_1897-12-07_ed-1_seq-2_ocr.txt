2 Some costumes of the ladles added much to the brightness of the scene. Precisely at noon the gavel of Vice- President Hobart fell and the Senate was called to order. The invocation was delivered by Rev. W. H. Milburn, the blind chaplain. He mode a beautiful and touching reference to "Our be loved President," who awailed news from the bedside of his mother, to whom he is devoted, and prayed that she might have a penccful passage to the celestial sphere. Seventy-seven responded t;o tn eir names on the roll call. The venerable Mr. Morrill, of Ver mont, was first recognized by the Vice- President. He offered a resolution, which was passed, in tho usual form, that the Secretary inform the House that the Senate was in session and ready to proceed to business. Mr. Allison, of lowa, presented a reso lution that a committee of two Senators be appointed to join a like committee from the House to Inform the President that Congress was in session and pre pared to receive any communication which he might desire to make to it. The resolution was passed and the Vice- President named Allison and Gorman as the Senate Committee. By resolution of Mr. Cullom, of Illin ois, the time of dally meetings of the Senate was fixed at noon. On motion of Mr. Hale, of Maine, a recess was then taken until 1 o'clock. At 1:30 the Senate assembled and the Committee, headed by Mr. Gorman, re ported. He said a like committee from the House had waited upon the Presi dent and informed him that the branches of Congress were in session and were ready to receive from him any message he might desire to present to them. Mr. Allison said that the President •would communicate to Congress in writing, and he expressed the hope that the deliberations of Congress might re sult in great good to the country and reflect honor upon itself. The President's message was pre sented by Air. Pruden, tho President's Assistant Secretary, and at 1:35 o'clock laid before the Senate and read. IN THE 

HOUSE The Big Crowd Finds Proceedings Bather Dry WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.—The opening Bay of the regular session in the house passed without unusual incident of any character. The formalities attending the inauguration of the session were dry, and, except as a spectacle, hardly re paid the crowds which thronged the public and private galleries. Yet, with few exceptions, the visitors sat through the whole proceedings. Mr. Dingley, the lloor leader of the majority: Mr. Bailey, the recognized leader of the minority, and Mr. Gros venor of Ohio enjoyed the distinguished honor of being appointed to wait upon the president, whose message was, of course, the event of the day. Its read ing was long and tedious, but it was fol lowed with close attention by the mem bers and the spectators in the galleries. There was no demonstration until the reading was concluded, when the Re publicans joined ln a hearty expression of approval. Immediately after the reading of the message the house ad journed out of respect to the memory of Senator George of Mississippi and Representative Wright of Massachu setts, who had died during the recess. The House of Representatives pre sented an nnimated appearance long be fore the arrival of the hour of noon. The surrounding corridors were filled with jostling, moving crowds, and be fore 11 o'clock the encircling galleries, which overlook the floor, were black with people. The hall buzzed with the subdued hum of conversation as the members ex changed greetings and chatted in groups. The leaders who were eagerly pointed out from the gallery, were also slow in putting in their appearance. Statesmen, like ordinary mortals, have an eye for dramatic effect. Chairman Hitt of the Foreign Rela tions Committee and Chairman Waller of the Banking and Currency Commit tee, whose positions will probably bring them into the public eye during the ses sion, were early on the floor, mingling with their colleagues. The floral tributes of the members were numerous and in some instances imposing. One, which attracted prob ably more attention than any other, on account of its unique character, graced the desk of General Grosvenor of Ohio. It consisted of a huge tree of yellow chrysanthemums and American beauty roses, under tho nodding branches of which stood an innocent toy lamb. It was a tribute from the National Woo! Growers' Association. Some one dis covered that under the administration of pressure to a portion of the lamb's anatomy it would give forth a sound resembling a bleat, and much amuse ment and merriment followed this dis closure. The representation of a huge gavel, in red and white carnations, stood upon the Speaker's table. At fifteen minutes before noon the floor Was cleared of all persons except mem • bers and officers. Soon afterward Mr. Bailey of Texas, the leader of the minor ity, and "Sliver Dollar" Bland of Mis souri entered the hall together. Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the Repub licans, smiling and affable as ever, came in just before the Speaker appeared. As the hands of the cluck pointed to 12 Speaker Rei d, attired in a black cut away coat anrl wearing a red tie, pushed through the doors from the lobby and ascended the rostrum. One crack of the gavel subdued the din on tbe floor and the conversation In the galleries. The gavel with which the Speaker called the House to order was presented to him by J. C. Groner, Sheriff of Knox county, Tennessee, who sent It in the name <,f the "stalwart Republic ans of East Tennessee." It was formally presented to the Speaker by H, Clay Evans, the Commissioner of Pensions. The gavel is made of apple tree wood, which grew beside the log house In which Farragut was born at Lowes Ferry, on the Tennessee river, six miles below Knoxville. In the deep silence which followed the calling of tho assemblage to order, the prayer of the Rev. Charles A. Berry of Wolverhampton, England, who delivered the invocation, was solemn and impres sive. The Speaker then Immediately di rectd the Clerk to call the roll, and this consumed half an hour. In the diplomatic gallery were Mr. Lefevre, charge d'affaires, and other diplomatic attaches of the French em bassy; Senor Correa, charge d'affaires of the Greater Republic of Central Amer - ica and other diplomats. In the execu tive gallery, reserved for the President, were a number of the executive house hold, who were admitted on cards from Secretary Porter, On the iloor were a number of ex-members. The roll call showed the presence of SOI members. There were five vacancies from death or resignation during the re cess, and the credentials of the mem bers-elect were read by direction of the Speaker, who then made administration of oaths to them. They were F. M. Gritt, Democrat, successor to the late Judge Holman In the Fourth Indiana District: H. C. Boutelle, Republican, of Chicago,who succeeded Edward D. Cook, deceased; James Norton, Democrat, of the Seventh South Carolina District,who succeeded John L. McLaurln, now Sen ator; George P. Lawrence, Republican, of the First Masaschusetts District, who succeeded Ashley E. Wright, deceased, and J. N. Griggs, Democrat, of the Third New York District, who succeeded Fran cis W. Wilson, who resigned to accept the position of postmaster at Brooklyn. The credentials of Mr. Griggs had not yet arrived, but the oath was adminis tered to him by unanimous consent. On motion of Mr. Hopkins, Republican, Illinois, the clerk was directed to notify the Senate that the House was ready for business, and on motion of Mr. Dingley. the floor leader, a resolution was adopted for the appointment of a committee of three to Join the committee of the Senate to wait on the President and inform him that Congress was ready to receive any communication he desired to make. The Speaker selected Messrs. Dingley of Maine, Grosvenor of Ohio and Bailey of Texas for this honor. On motion of Mr. Henderson of lowa, a member of the Committee on Rules, the rule at the extra session of three day adjournments was vacated, and daily sessions, to begin at noon each day, were ordered. There being nothing to do but await the reception of the President's message, the House recessed until 1:20 p. m. When the House reconvened another recess of of twenty minutes was ordered. When the House reassembled at 1:40 the committee appointed to wait upon the President came down the middle aisle and reported that the committee had performed its mission. "The President was pleased," said the committee, "to send the House his re spectful salutation and to inform them that he would communicate with them in -writing." On motion of Mr. Dingley the mes sage waß referred to the committee of the whole and ordered printed. Mr. Lawrence, Republican, of Massa chusetts, then officially announced the death of his predecessor, the late Rep resentative Wright, and Mr. Allen, Dem ocrat, of Mississippi, the death of Sen ator George. Out of respect to their memories the house at 3:05 p. m. adjourned sine die. OFF FOR

LOS 

ANGELES HERALD: TUESDAY MORNING. DECEMBER 7, 189? GERMAN NAVY Now Engrosses Reichstag Attention PLAINTIVE PLEAS ARE MADE BY OBEDIENT SERVANTS OF THE KAISER Social Democratic Opposition to the Emperor's Scheme Exhibits It self With Promptitude t Associated Press Special Wire. BERLIN, Dec. 6.—The relchstag to day began the debate upon the first read ing of the government naval bill. The Imperial chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe, made a statement on the subject, say ing: "We absolutely require an efficient WILLIAM 11., EMPEROR OF GERMANY navy to maintain the position created for us by the army. This conviction has gained ground with very large sections of the population, and I declare in the name of the federated governments that they consider as an imperative necessity that the navy should be strengthened and that its strength should be fixed by legislative enactment. The bill, it is true, demands a certain sacrifice from the reichstag, but by its adoption the hands of the government will also bo tied. The adoption of a policy of adven ture is as far from the thoughts of the government as is any Intention of rival ry with the great maritime powers. ]f we desire to secure a position in the con cert of the powers, which we must have, a fleet of modest dimensions will be ade quate. I ask you to adopt the bill for the welfare of the fatherland." (Cheers from the Right.) Admiral yon Tlrpits, secretary of the navy, then addressed the house, ex plaining in detail the necessity for in troducing the bill to strengthen Ger many. He pointed out that the proposed new ships would establish a basis which, for a long time to come, would meet the requirements of the country. By the adoption of the bill, the secre tary of the navy continued, the next reichstag would be debarred from re tarding the rate of construction, but he insisted that no further restrictions would be imposed upon parliament. The secretary of the navy said that ln connection with the completion of the Kaiser Wilhelm canal, tactical cal culations were made in regard to the necessary strength of the fleet in order to render offensive action, even on the part of the strongest naval power, im possible. He added: "In the demand for two squadrons of eight ships each, we are supported by the whole corps of naval officers. I am prepared to give more detailed explana tions, in committee, regarding the mili tary points involved. "Our active fleet is a fleet for defense. What we ask is the minimum necessary to enable us to throw a heavy weight into the scales, on the side of peace. In 1004 our fleet will no longer be a 'quan tite negligeable,' and German maritime interests will have been increased. To underestimate tho importance of this would endanger the interests of the em pire generally." In conclusion Admiral Tlrpits de clared that the present system of voting naval supplies must be changed, and he appealed to the reichstag to favorably consider the government measure. The admiral's remarks were greeted with cheers from several sections. Herr Schucnlank,Social Democrat, op posed the bill. He thought it curious that the Haws in the navy had only now been discovered. Attempts were being made, he claimed, to frighten the peo ple with phantoms and excite them to a craving for glory. How, the speaker asked, could this be reconciled with the pacific declarations of the emperor? Referring to the occupation of Kiao Chau bay by the German squadron in Chinese waters, he said that if Germany established herself in China she would become involved in endless complica tions with Great Britain and Japan. Germany, he declared, would never tie a naval power. The bill, he said, was the outcome of personal rule. Count Llmburg-Stirrum, the Conserv ative leader, disputed Herr Schoenlank'u contention. "We have no guarantee of peace," he said, "and must arm our selves for the eventuality of war. "Why should a German charge d'af faires be obliged to submit to be treated with shameless arrogance by the blacks of Haytl 7 And how was It that the min ister carried his point? Because he had only to telegraph in order to at once ob tain efficient support." Count Posadowskl, minister for the Interior, was the next speaker. He said the federal government had no idea of arresting social legislation. ( "Herr Schoenlank," he continued, "has spoken of absolutist tendencies in a cer tain quarter, but if Herr Schoenlank's views ever find favor with a majority of the reichstag there will be no need of absolutism to destroy parllamentlsm." (Cheers and counter cheers.) The minister for foreign affairs. Ba ron yon Bulow, said: "Herr Schoen lank's fears that we shall plunge Into ad ventures are not well grounded. Tho chancellor and his colleagues are not men to seek useless quarrels. We do not poke our fingers into every pie, but nev ertheless Germany must not renounce her claim to have a share of the coun tries having a rich future. In times past when Germany resigned the land to one neighbor and the sea to another she kept for herself only the heavens where pure doctrine dwells. The object of the expe dition to Kiao Chau bay Is to obtain sat isfaction and greater guarantees against the repetition of such occurrences. We do not wish to intimidate or provoke China. Notwithstanding the grave in justice done, we desire a continuance of her friendship. In addition to the mur der of the two German missionaries, whom we cannot allow to be regarded as outlaws, we have had a number of other serious grounds for complaint. We cannot allow the view to become es tablished In China that Germans can be treated in a manner which other nations do not permit. German missionaries, contractors, goods and vessels must be respected exactly as those of other countries. We are quite ready fo con sider the Asiatic interests of the other powers, feeling sure due regard will be paid to ours. We wish to push no one Into the shade, but we demand our share of the sun. Through the traditions of German policy we will, without unnec essary alacrity, but at the same time without weakness, protect our rights and interests." (Prolonged cheers.) Herr Barthei, the Frelslnnlge lead er, said further light would be thrown on the bill in committee. The Frelsln nlge party, he added, had no idea of rejecting the measure summarily. Count yon Jazdawski, the Polish lead er, declared the Poles would not accept the bill in its present shape. The house adjourned until tomorrow. It is deemed significant that 120 vol unteers, Including a number of members of the aristocracy like Count yon Kess ler and the Prince of Thurn and Taxis, are to accompany the expedition to Kiao Chau bay with Prince Henry of Prussia as its commander. ♦ —_— IN
