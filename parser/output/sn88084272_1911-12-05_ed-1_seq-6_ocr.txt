PRESIDENT TAFT breaks the record for brevity, with Ms annual message that is, for recent years. The earlier presidents got through in less, hut McKi nifty used to string them out some and Roooovelt wrote whole encyclo pedias, dictionaries, gazetteers, medical treatises, literary essays, aad sociological libraries to congress on his official note paper at the beginning of every session and every few days thereafter. President Taft's idea is that not more than one big subject can be expected te soak into the congressional mjnd at one sitting. He will probably- write- a Rease-. veltian volume before he exhausts Ms subjects, but it will be administered in safe doses, and not turned in with a force pomp. The first dose is 6000 words, printed today. In this connection it is well to remember that the story of the creation of the world is told in 300 words, which shows that the gentleman who forgot to copy right his masterpiece, the book of Genesis, must have been an artist at condensing his narrative as well as a remarkably successful politician. One thing sure, Gen. Moses never wrote on space rates. President Taft's first advice to congress is to kt the Sherman anti-trust act alone neither to amend nor to repeal it. He is willing that certain new legislation to supplement the law be enacted, especially laws providing for voluntary federal incorporation of concerns doing an interstate business, establishing a national cor poration commission, and more clearly defining unlawful acts and methods. The message will be read with particular interest by lawyers, but every citizen who tries to keep up with the course of national lawmaking and discussion ought to get the gist of it at least. The president goes quite fully into the late decisions of the supreme; court in the tobacco and oil cases; shows their real effect; demon strates that they read no new'meaning into the law but merely follow well astao lished precedent; and describee how one of the big corporations proceeded against, the tobacco combine, has gone to work under the direction of the court to dissolve itself into constituent companies which, in the nature of things, according to the president, must either become active competitors or else drop behind in the indus trial march. Injunctions prevent individual stockholders from acquiring monopo listic control inside three years. The president makes clear that mere size should not in itself be regarded as a condition inimical to the public welfare, but only such features should be inter fered with as tend unduly to restrict industry or commerce, or to prevent whole. some competition. Combinations based on. lawful aad rational considerations, whose effect is to reduce costs of production and promote effkiescy, without unda interference with competitors, are not to be regarded as a menace. The message sent in today is entirely devoted to regulation of corporations, indicating that this subject will be one of the first and most important to be taken up by congress at this session.
