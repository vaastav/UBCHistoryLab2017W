For the fiscal year the expenditures were $700,093,5(4.02, leaving a deficit of $89,111,550.67.

The present gratifying strength of the treasury is shown by the fact that on December 1, 1899, the available cash balance was $278,004,837.72, of which $239,744,905.36 was in gold coin and bullion. The conditions of confidence which prevail throughout the country have brought gold into more general use. and customs receipts are now al most entirely paid in that coin. The strong condition of the treasury with ryspoct to cash on hand and the favorable showing made bv the reve nues have madp it possible for the sec retary of the treasury to take action under the jirovlsions of section 3694, revised statutes, relating to the sink ing fund. Iteceipts exceeded expendi tures for the first five months of the current fiscal year by $13,413,389-91, and, as mentioned above, the secretary of the treasury estimates that there will be a surplus of approximately $40,000,000 at the end of the year.

PHILIPPINES DUTY PLAIN Must. Crush Insurrection and Es iiablish Order—Future Rule V, Rests, With Congress. Vf fy*®. Washington, Dec. 5.—President Mc Kinley's message was read in congress thin afternoon: To the Senate anil House of Repre sentatives: At the threshold of your deliberations yo« tire culled to mourn with your countrymen the death of Vice President Hobart, who passed from this life on the morning of No vember 21 last. His great soul now rests in eternal pence. Jiis private life was pure and elevated, while his pub lic career was ever distinguished by large capacity, stainless integrity, and exalted motives. He lias been removed from the high office which he honored and dignified, but his lofty character, his devotion to duty, his honesty of purpose and noble virtues remain with us as a priceless legacy and exnmple. The Fifty-sixth congress convenes in itb first:regular session with the conn try in cvditipn of unusual prosper ity, of universal good will among the people at home, and relations of pence and friendship with every gov ernment of the world. Our foreign commerce has shown great increase in volume and value. 'I lie combined im ports and exports for the year are the largest ever shown by a single vear in nil our history. Our exports for 1S90 alone exceeded our imports and ex ports combined 111 1870. The imports per capita arc 20 per cent less than in while the exports per capita arc 58 per 1870, while the exports per capita are 58 per cent more than in 1870, showing the enlarged capacity of the-United tates to satisfy the wants of its own losing population, as well as to te to those of the peoples of other nntttHJs. sports oTvnfiricultural products were $784,776,liS^Of manufactured products we exporhid» value 592,146, being larger than an3' preens year. It is a noteworthy fact that the only years in all our history when the products of onr inanufactol-ics sold abroad exceeded those bought abroad were 1898 and isoof Government receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1890,. including $11,798, !M.14, part .payment of the Central Pacific rail road indebtedness, aggregated $610, 982,004.35. Customs ^receipts were $206,128,481.7!), and those from internal revenue $273,437,161.51 The premium paid by the government on such purchases was $2,263,5^1 and the net saving in in terest was about $2,885,000. The suc cess of this.operation was suflieient to induuv.the government to continue the offer to purchase bonds to and in /Jliding the 23d day of December, lnst., unless the remainder of the $25, 000,000. called for should be presented in the meantime by redemption. Increased activity in industry with its welcome attendants—a large em ployment pf labor at higher wages— gives to the body of people a larger power to., absorb the circulating me dium. It, is further true that year by year with larger areas of land under cultivation,, the increasing volume of agricultural products, corn and wheat, calls for a larger volume of money feupply. This is especially no ticeablc at the crop harvests and crop 'moving period. •'Jp its earlier history the national banking Met sedmed to prove a reason able- avenue: through which needful adtgittops tothe circulation could frort time to time be made.

The high margin in bond securities require?!, resulting from large prem iums which government bonds com mand in the market, or the tax on note issues, or both operating togeth CXV appear to be the influences which Impair lis public utility.

TO 

UPH0L0 GOLD STANDARD. «ccret»n of ihn Treasury's Powers 4'"4' Htiould Ho ISiilnrired. ... I'fiJrgently recommend that- to sup WK^JJie Wisting gold standard, and to 'lh* parity in value of the !ms nf. fh(t two metnl8 (gold and sll anq the equal power of every toe duty ttf seil United States bonds and. to«niplor «uch other effective means, as Buiy be necessary -to those ends. The sutbority. should include the pow er t6 :Wll bonds .on long and short tlme, «s conditions may require, and should provide for rate of interest lower than that fixed by the act o'f January 14, 1875. While there Is now no eonimercial: fright which with draws gold from the government, but, on the contrary, isucb widespread con fidence that gold seeks the treasury demanding paper money in exchange, yet the vffry situation points to the present as the most fitting time to make adequate provision to Insure the continuance of the gold standard and of public confidence in the ability and purpose of the -government to, meet all its obligations in the money "which the civilized world recognizes as the best. The financial transactions of the government arc conducted upon a gold basis. We receive gold when we sell United States bonds, and use gold for their payment. We are maintain ing the parity of nil the money issued or coined by authority of the govern ment. We are doing these things with the means at hand. Happily at the present time we' are not compelled to resort to loans to supply gold. It has been done in the past, however, and may have to be done in the future. It behooves us, therefore, to provide at once the best means to meet the emergency when it arises, and the best- means are those which are the most certain and economlenl. Those now authorized have the virtue neither of directness or economy. We have already eliminated one of the causes of our financial plight and embarrass ment during the years 1893^1894, 1895 and 1896. Our receipts now equal our expenditures deficient revenues no longer create alarm. Let us remove the only remaining cause by confer ring the full and necessary power on the secretary of the treasury and im pose iipon him the duty to uphold the present gold standard and preserve the coins of the two metals on a par ity with each other, which is the re peatedly declared policy of the United States. In this connection I repeat my form er recommendations that a portion of the gold holdings shall be placed in a trust fund, from which greenbacks shall be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed, -shall not thereafter be paid out except for gold. AID FOR 

MERCHANT MARINE. Goveruincnt.nl Asglstaneo Needed to lleliabilitalo It. The value of an American merchant marine to the extension of our com mercial trade and tluv.strengthening of our power upon the sea, invites the immediate action of congress. Our national development'will be one-sided and unsatisfactory so long as the re markable growth of our inland indus tries remains unaccompanied by prog ress on the seas. There is no lack of constitutional authority for legisla tion which shall give to the country maritime strength commensurate with ~Hfl4ttdustrial achievements and with its rank among the nations of the earth. The past year lias TWKU'ded excep tional activity in our shipyards, and the promises of continual prosperity in shipbuilding are abundant. Ad vanced legislation for the protection of our seamen lias been enacted. Our coast trade, under-regulations wisely framed at the beginning of the gov ernment and since, shows results for the past fiscal year unequalled in our records or those of any other power. We shall fail to realize our opportuni ties, however, if we complacently re: gard only matters at home and blind ourselves to the necessity of securing our share in the valuable carrying trade of the world. Last year American, vessels trans ported a smaller share of our exports and Imports than during any former year in all our history, and the meas ure of our dependence upon foreign shipping was painfully manifested to our people. Without any choice of our own, but from necessity, the de partments of the government charged with military '.and naval operations in the east and West Indies, had to- ob tain from foreign Hags merchant ves sels essential for those operations. The other great nations have not hesitated to adopt the required means to develop their shipping as a factor in national defense, and as one of the surest and speediest means of obtain mg for their producers a share in for eign markets. Like vigilance and ef fort on our part cannot fail to im prove our situation, which is regard ed with humiliation at home and witli surprise abroad. Even the seeming sacrifices, which at the beginning may be involved, will be offset later by more than equivalent gains. The expense is as nothing com pared to the advantage to be achieved. The re-establishment of our merchant marine involves in a large measure our continued industrial progress and the extension of our commercial tri umphs. I am satisfied the judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our merchant marine, which will broaden our commerce and markets and upbuild our sea carrying capacity for the products of agriculture and manufacture which, with the increase of our navy, meftn more work and wages to our countrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of the world. QUESTION OF TRUSTS. Combinations Which Snppvess Com petition Men ace Public Welfare. Combinations of capital organized into trusts to control the conditions of trade among our citizens, to stifle competition, limit production and de termine the prices of products used and consumed by tlie people, are just ly provoking public discussion, and .should early claim the attention of the congress. The industrial commission, created by the act of the congress of June 18. 1898, has been engaged in. extended hearings upon the disputed questions involved in the subject of combinations in restraint of trade and competition. They have not yet completed their in vestigation of this subject, and the conclusions and recommendations at which they may arrive are undeter mined. The subject is one giving rise to many divergent views as to the nature and variety, or cause und extent, of the injuries to the public which may result from large combinations con centrating more or less numerous en terprises and establishments, which previously to the formation of the combination were carried on separ ately. It is universally conceded thnt com binations which engross or control the market of any particular kind of merchandise or commodity necessary to the general community, by sup pressing natural and ordinary com petition, whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law, but also to the public welfare. There,must be remedy for the evils involved* in such organizations. If the present law can be extended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay. Whatever power the congress possesses over this most im portant subject. should be promptly ascertained and asserted. Uniform Stnte IiPu'slntlon Needoi The state legislation market «nd '. "to which Pres­ ident Cleveland looked, for relief from the evils of trusts has failed to accom- ity.4^t^je^' ::.jrhls fiprob- W to a great e3rtent io ,t)ie fact •tnst different .states i.-tatos-' It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the several states is much to be desired. It is to be hoped that sttoh uniformity founded in wise nnd just discrimina tion between what is injurious and what is useful and netessary in busi ness operations may be obtained and that means may be found for the con gress within the limitations of its con stitutional power so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make complete system of laws throughout the United Stats adequate to compel a general observance of the salutary rules, to which I have re ferred. The whole question is so important and far reaching that I am sure no part of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of it .will have the studied deliberation of the congress, resulting in wise nnd judicions action. THE 

PHILIPPINES-PROBLEM. Bevolt Musi Be Crushed mill Amer ican Sovereignty Established. On the 10th of December, 1S98, the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain was signed. It pro vided, among other things, that Spain should cede to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine islands, that the United States should pay to Spain the sum of $20,000,000 and that the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants of the territories thus ceded to the United States should be determined by con gress. -The treaty was ratified by the senate on the Gth of February, 1S99, and by the government or Spain the 19th of March following. The rati fications were exchanged on the 11th of April, and the treaty publicly pro claimed. On the 2d of March the con gress voted the sum contemplated by the treaty and the amount was paid over to the Spanish government on the 1st of May. In this manner the Philippines came to the United States. The islands were ceded by the government of Spain, which had been in undisputed possession of them for centuries. They were accepted, not- merely by our au thorized commissioners in Paris, un der the direction of the executive, but' by the constitutional and well-consid ered action of the representatives of the people of the United States in both houses of congress. I had every reason to believe, and I still believe, that this transfer of sovereignty was in accordance with the wishes and the aspirations of the great masses of the Filipino people. From the earliest moment no oppor tunity was lost of assuring the people of the. islands of our ardent, desire for their welfare and of tli^ intention of this government J^ ^rreveT^hing^pos sible tq^tttVfance their interests, ln-4-—The_courfje iny oriler of the 19th of May, 1898, the commander of the military expedition dispatched to the Philippines was in structed to declare that we came not to make war upon the people of that country, "nor upon any party or fac tion among them, but to protect them in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights." That there should be no doubt as to the paramount authority Ihere, on the 17tli of August, it was de clared that "there must be no joint oc cupation with the insurgents that the United Spates must preserve the peace and protect, persons and prop erty within the territory occupied by their military and naval forces that the insurgents and all others must recognize the military occupation and authority of the United States. As early as December 4, before the cession, and in anticipation of that event, the commander in Manila was urged to restore peace and tranquility and to undertake the establishment of a beneficent government, whieli should afford the fullest security for life nnd property. On the 21st of December, after the treaty was signed, the comma'.der of the forces of occupation was instruct ed "to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not. as invaders nnd conquerors, but as friends to^jiroteet the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personnl ami religious rights On the snine day, while or dering General Otis to see that the peace should be preserved at Iloilo, he. was admonished that: "It is most im portant that there should be no con flict with the insurgents." On the 1st day of February, 1899, urgent orders were reiterated that the kindly inten tions of this government should be in every possible way communicated to the insurgents. Commission Sent to Manila. On the 21st of January I announced my intention of dispatching to Manila commission composed of three gen tlemen of the highest character nnd distinction,.. thoroughly acquainted with the oi'ient, who, in association with Admiral Dewey and Major Gen eral Otis, were instructed to "facili tate the most humane and effective extension of authority throughout the islands, and tp secure with the least possible delay the benefits of a wise and generous protection of life nnd property to the inhabitants." These gentlemen were: Dr. Jacob Gould Schurmnn. president of Cornell uni versity the Hon. Charles Den by, for many years minister to China, nnd Professor Dean C. Worcester, of the University of Michigan, who made a most careful study of life in the Phil ippines. While the treaty of peace was under consideration- in the sen ate these commissioners set out on their mission of good-will and liber ation. Their character was a suf ficient guarantee of the beneficent purpose with which they went, even if they had not borne the positive in structions of this government, which made thpir errand pre-eminently one of peace and friendship. Work or a Few Plotters. But before their arrival at Manila the sinister ambition of a few leaders of the Filipinos had created a situa tion full of embarrassments for us and most grievous in its consequences to themselves. The clear and impar tial preliminary report of the commis sioners, which transmit herewith, gives so lucid and comprehensive a history of the present insurrectionary movement, that the story need not be here repeated It is enough to say that the claim of the rebel lender that he was promised independence by any of ficer of the United States in return for his assistance has no foundation in fact and is categorically denied by the very witnesses who were called to prove it. The most the insurgent leader hoped for when he came back to Ma nila was the liberation of the islands, from tbe Spanish contrpl, which they had been laboring for years withotlt success to throw off. The prompt accomplishment of this work by the American army nnd navy gave lifm other ideas and ambitions, and insidious suggestions from va rious quarters perverted the purposes and .intentions with which he had taken up arms. No sooner had our army captured Manila than the Fili pino forces 'began to assume an atti tude of suspicion and hostility which the utmost-efforts of our officers and troops,-wet* unable to disarm or modi- v* I different views as to tbe proper way to discrim inate between evil: and injurious com-' binations and those associations wliich are beneficial and. necessary to the business prosperity of the countir. The great diversity of treatment in different states arising'from this cause and the intimate relations of all parts of the country to each other without regarding state lines in the conduct of business have made the enforce ment of state laws difficult. ly. Thdr kindaess and forbearance treH.teltn as a. proof 'of cowardice. The ajrgressiona of the Filipinos eon tiuuaily increased until finally, just before the time set by the senate of the United States for a vote upon the treaty, an attack, evidently pre pared in advance, was made all along the American lines, which resulted in a terribly destructive and saguinary repulse, of the insurgents.' Vililiinu Minfoure Plot. Ten days later an order of the in surgent government was issued to its adherents who remained in Manila, of which General Otis justly observes that "for barbarous intent it is tm equaled in. modern times." It directs that at 8 o'clock on the night of the 15th of February, the territorial militia shall come together in the streets of San Pedro, armed with their bolos, with guns and ammuni tion, where convenient that Filipino families only shall be respected but that all other individuals, of whatever race they may be, shall be extermin ated .without any compassion, after the extermination of the army of oc cupation,. and adds: "Brothers, we must avenge ourselves on the Amer icans and, exterminate them, that we may take our revenge for the in famies and treacheries which they have committed upon us. Have no compassion upon them attack with vigor." A copy of this fell, by good fortune, into the hands of our offi cers and they were able to take meas ures to control the rising, which was actually attempted on the night of February 22, a week later than was originally contemplated. A consider able number of armed insurgents en tered the city by waterways rind swamps and in concert with confed erates inside attempted to destroy Manila by fire. They were kept in check during the night and the next day driven out of the city with heavy loss. This was the unhappy condition of affairs which confronted our commis sioners on their arrival In Manila. They had come with the hope nnd in tention of co-operating with Admiral Dewey nnd Major General Otis in es tablishing peace and order in the arch ipelago and the lnrgest measure of self government compatible with the true welfare of the people. What they actually found can best be set forth in their own words: War Was Unavoidable. "Deplorable as war is, the one in whioh wc are now engaged was un avoidable by us. We were attacked by a bold, adventurous and enthusi astic army. No alternative was left to us except ignominious retreat. "It is not to be conceived of thnt any American would have sanctioned tiie surrender of Manila to the insur gents. Our obligations to other na tions and to the friendly Filipinos and to ourselves nnd onr flag demanded that force should be met by force. Whatever the future of the Philippines maj- be, there is no course open to us now except the prosecution eff the war until the insurgents are reduced to submission. The commission is of the opinion that there has been no time since the destruction of the Spanish squadron by Admiral Dewey when it wns possible to withdraw our forces from the islands, either with honor to ourselves or with safety to the inl'-^ itants." tYuYs 'cienrly indicated has been unflinchingly pursued. The rebellion must be jiiit down. Civil government cannot be thoroughly es tablished until order is restored. With a devotion and gallantry worthy of its most brilliant history, the army, ably and loyally assisted by the navy, has carried on this unwelcome, but most righteous, compaign with richly de served success. The noble sqlf sacri fices with which onr soldiers and sail ors whose, terms of service had ex pired refused to avail themselves of tlieir right to return home as long as they were needed at the front-forms one of the brightest pages in our an nals. Although their operations hnve been somewhat interrupted nnd checked by a rainy season of unusual violence and duration, they have gained ground stendily in every direc tion, and now look forward confident ly to a speedy completion of tlieir task. President's lu(y Clear. Until congress fhall have made known the formal expression of its will I shall use the authority vested in me by the constitution and the sintutcs to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distant inlands as in all other places where our flag rightfully fioats. I shall put at the disposal of the army and navy all the means which the liberality of congress and the people have provid ed to cause this unprovoked and wasteful insurrection to cease. If any orders of mine were required to insure the merciful conduct ,of mili tary nnd naval operations, they would not be lacking but every step of the progress of our troops has .been .marked by a humanity which has sur prised even the misguided insurgents. The truest kindness to them will be a swift and effective defeat of their present leader. The hour of victory will be the hour of clemency and re construction. No effort will be spared to build up the waste places desolated by war and by long years of misgovernmcnt. We shall not wait for the end of strife to begin the beneficent work. We shall continue, us we have begun, to open the schools and the churches, to set the courts in operation, to foster industry nnd trade and agriculture, and in every way in our power to make these people whom providence lias brought within our jurisdiction feci that it, is their liberty and not our power, their welfare and not our gain, we are seeking to enhance. Our flag has never waved over any community but in blessing. I believe the Fili pinos will soon recognize the fact that it has not lost its gift of benedic tion in its world-wide journey to their shores. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. Disputes with Various Nations Am icably Adjusted. A review of our relations with for eign states is presented with such rec ommendations as are deemed appro priate. The long pending boundary dispute between the Argentine Iiepublic and Chile was settled in March last by the award of an nrbitral commission, on which the United States minister at Buenos Ayres served us umpire. Progress has been.innde-toward the conclusion of a convention of extradi tion with the Argentine Republic. Having been advised and consented to by the United States senate and rati fied by Argentina, it only awaits the adjustment of some slight changes in the text before exchange. In my last annual message I advert* cd to the claim of the Austro-Hun pirlan government for indemnity for the killing of certain Austrian nnd Hungarian subjects by the authorities of the state of Pennsylvania, at Latti ncr, while suppressing an unlawful •umult of miners, September 10, 1897. in view of the verdict, of acquittal ren dered by the court before "which the sheriff and his deputies were tried for murder, and following the established ioctrine that the government may not be held accountable for injuries gof fered by individuals at the hands of ?he public authorities while acting lp the line of duty in suppressing dis turbance of the public peace, this gov ernment, after due consideration of the claim advanced by the Austro Hungarjan government, was con strained-to decline liability to indem fcify the -.uffererg. It is gratifying to be able to an- nounce thnt the Belgian^govcrnmemi baa mitigated the restrictions on the importation of cattle front the United States, to which I referred in my last: annual message. Having been invited by Belgium to participate in a congress held at Brus sels, to revise the provisions of the. general act .of July 2, 1890, for the re pression of the African slave trade, to which-the United States was a signa tory .party, this government pre ferretT not to be represented by a plenipotentiary, but reserved the right of accession to the result. Notnlile changes were made those especially concerning this country being in the line of the increased restriction of the deleterious trnde in spirituous liquors with the native tribes, which this government has from the outset urgently advocated. The amended general act will be laid before the senate, with a view to its advicc and consent- The Nicaragua Canal. The contract of the Maritime Cunal company, of Nicaragua, was declared forfeited by the Nicaraguau govern ment on the loth of October, on the ground of non-fulfillment within the ten years' term stipulated in the con tract. The Maritime Canal company has lodged a protest against this ac tion, alleging rights in the premises, which appear worthy of consideration. This government expects tluit Nicar agua will afford the protestunts a full and fnir hearing ujion the merits of the case. The Nicaragua canal commission, whicli had been engaged upon the work of examination and surrey for a ship canal route across Nicuragua, having completed its labors und made its report, was dissolved on May 31, and on June I'D, a new commission, known as the Isthmian canal commission, was organized under the terms of the uet approved March 3, 1SU9, for the purpose of examining the American isthmus with a view to determining the most practicable and feasible route for a ship canal across thnt isth mus, with its probable cost, and other essential details. This commission, under the presi dency of Rear Admiral John G. Walk er, U. S. N. (retired), entered prompt ly upon the work intrusted to it, and is now carrying on examinations in Nicaragua along the route of the Pan ama canal, and in Daricn from the At lantic, in (he neighborhood of the At rato river, to the bay of Panama, on the Pacific side. Good progress lias been made, but under the'law a com prehensive and complete investigation is called for, which will require much labor and considerable time for its accomplishment. The work will be prosecuted as expeditiously as possi ble and a report made at the earliest practicable date. The great importance of this work cannot be too often or too strongly pressed upon the attention of the con gress. In my message of a year ago I expressed my views of the necessity of a canal which would link the two great oceans, to which I again invite your consideration. The reasons then presented for early action are even stronger now. rtcln(loi)s..\vUti Clitic. --rA' jVitasing incident in the relations of this government with that of Chile occurred in the generous assistance given to the warship Newark when in distress in Chilean waters. Not alone in this way has the friendly dis position of Chile found expression. That country lias acceded to the con vention for the. establishment of the bureau of the American republics, in whieli organization every independent state of the continent now shares. The exchange of ratifications of a convention for the revival of the Unit ed States and Chilean claims commis sion nnd for the adjudication of claims heretofore presented but not determined during the life of the pre vious commission has been delayed by reason of t-lie necessity for fresh action by the Chilean senate upon the amendments attached to the ratifica tion of the treaty by the United States senate. This formality is soon to be accomplished. Uncle Sum nnd China. In view of disturbances in the popu lous provinces of northern China, where are many of our citizens, and of the imminence, of disorder near the capital and toward the seaboard, a guurd of murines was landed from the Boston nnd stationed during Inst winter in the legation compound at Peking. With the restoration of order this protection was withdrawn. The interests of our citizens in that vast empire have not. been neglected during the past year. Adequate pro tection has been secured for our mis sionaries and some injuries to their property have been redressed. American capital lias sought nnd found various opportunities of com peting to carry out the interual im provements which the imperial gov ernment is wisely encouraging, and to develop the natural resources of the empire. Our trade with China lias con tinued to grow, and onr commercial rights under existing treaties have been everywhere maintained during the pnst year, as they will be in the future. The extension of the area open to international .foreign settlement at Shanghai and the opening of the ports of Nanking, Tsing-Tao (Kiao Chao) and Ta-Lien-Wnn to foreign trade nnd settlement will doubtless afford American enterprise additional facil ities and new fields, of which it will not be slow'to take advantage. In my message to congress of De cember 5, 1898, I urged that the rec ommendation which had been made to the speaker of the house of represent atives by the secretary of the treasury on the 14th of June, 1898, for an ap propriation for a commission to study the commercial and industrial condi tions in the Chinese empire nnd report as to the opportunities for, and ob 'stacles to, the enlargements of mar kets in China for the raw products and manufactures of the United States, should receive at- your hands the consideration which 'its import ance und timeliness merited, but the congress failed to take action. I now renew, this recommendation, as the importance of the subject has steadily grown since it Was first sub mitted to you. and no time should be lost in studying for ourselves the re sources of this great, field for Amer ican trade and enterprise. Con trovers! en With Canada. In my last annual message I referred' to the pending negotiations with Great Britain in respect to the Dominion of Canada. By means of an executive agree ment a Joint high commission ha» Tieen created for the purpose of adjusting all unsettled questions between the United States and Canada, embracing twelve subjects, among which were the questions of the fur seals, the fisheries of the coast mux contiguous inland waters, the Alas kan boundary, the transit of merchandise in bond, the alien Inbor laws, mining rights, reciprocity in trade, revision of the agreement respecting naval vessels in the great lakes, a moire complete marking of parts of the boundary, pro vision for the conveyance of criminals and for wrecking and salvage. Much progress has been made by the commission toward the adjustment of many of these questions where it became apparent that ah irreconclliable difference ox views was ^entertained respecting the delimitation of the Alaskan boundary. In the failure of an agreement as to the a,,t'cles 3 and 4 of the treaty of-1826 between Russia and Great Brit ain, which defined the boundary between Alaska and Canada, the American com mlssloner* proposed that the subject of the boundary bo laid aside and that the remaining questions of difference be pro ceeded with, some of which were so far advanced as to assure the probability of settlement. This being declined by the lirltish commissioners, an adjournment \ras taken, until the boundary should be id justed by the two governments. The •ubjcct has been receiving the careful at tention which its importance demands, with the result lhat a modus vivendi for provisional demarcations in the region ibout the head ct£ Lynn canal has been greed upon and \t Is hoped that the ne "gelations now in progress between the f^TLAW •Wo. governments will end In. an agree montforthtsertabllshmentanddetlmita- tion of & permanent boundary. Apart from these questions growing out of our relationship wlttibttr northern neighbor, the inost friendly disposition and ready agreement have marked- the discussion: of-numerous matters arising in the vast and intimate intercourse of the United, States with Great Britain. ANGLO-ioiR WAR. America Would Have Been Olnd to Medintc-ItAllnn Ijyliuhtiijt** This government has maintained an at Utude of neutrality in the unfortunate contest between Great Britain and the Boer states of Africa. We have remained faithful to the precept of avoiding en tangling alliances as to affairs not of our direct concern. Had circumstances sug? gested that the parties to the quarrel would have welcomed any kindly expres sion of the hope of the American people, that war might be averted, good offices would have been gladly tendered. The United States representative at Pretoria was early instructed to see that all neu tral American interests be respcclcd by the combatants. This has been an easy task in view of the positive declarations of both British and Boer authorities that the personal and property rights of our citizens should be observed. Upon the withdrawal of the British agent from Pretoria the United States consul was authorized, upon the request of the British government and* with the assent of the South African and Orange Free 8tate governments, to exercise the customary good olttccs of a neutral for the care of' British Interests. In the dischaige of this function I am happy to suy that abundant opportunity nas been afforded to show the Impartiality of this government toward both the com batants. Ttcny With Japan. The treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan on November 22, 1S94, took effect in accord ance with the terms of its nineteenth art icle on the 17th of July last, simulta neously with«the enforcement of like treaties with the other powers, except France, whose convention did not go Into operation until August 4, the United date all the privileges and rights ac corricd to French citizens under the old French treaty. By this notable conven tional reform Japan's position as a fully independent sovereign power Is nssurea, control being gained of taxation,'customs revenues, judiclul administration, coast ing trade and all other domestic functions of government and foreign extra-terri torial rights being renounced. fi IN REGARD TO CUBA. America's Pledge Must Ue Sacred ly Kept. The withdrawal of the authority of Spain from the island of Cuba wns ef fected by the 1st of January, so that the full re-establishment of peace found the relinquished territory held by us in trust for the inhabitants, maintaining:, under the direction of the executive, such government and control therein as should conserve public order, restore the productive conditions of peace so long disturbed by the instability and disorder which prevailed for the greater part of the preceding three decades, and build up that tranquil development of the do mestic state whereby alone can be realized the high purpose, as pro claimed in the joint resolution adopt ed by congress on the 19th of April, 1898, by which the United States dis claimed any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over Cuba, except for the pacification thereof, and asserted its determination when that wns accom plished to leave the government and control of the island to its people. The plede^cqnj^vhT?^t^^^T1^"reswUltion is of TfJehighest honorable obligttt+OlT and must be sacredly kept. This nation has assumed before the world a grave responsibility for the future good government of Cuba. Wc have accepted a trust the fulfillment of which calls for the sternest integ rity of purpose and the exercise of the highest wisdom. The new Cuba yet to arise from the ashes of the past 'must needs be bound to us by ties of singular intimacy and strength if its enduring welfare is to be as sured. Whether those ties shall be or ganic or conventional, the destinies of Cuba are in some rightful form and manner irrevocably linked with our own, but how and how far is for the future to determine in the ripeness of events. Whatever be the outcome, we must see to it thnt free Cuba be a reality, not a name, a perfect entity, not a hasty experiment bearing with in itself elements of failure. ANGLO-VENEZUELAN SETTLEMENT Centnry-Ohl Dispute Ended by the Pails Award. The international commission of ar bitration, appointed under the Anglo Venezuelan treaty of 1807, rendered an award on October 3 last, whereby the boundary line between Venezuela and British (Juiana is determined, thus ending a controversy whicli has exist ed for the greater part, of the century. The award, as to which the arbitrators were unanimous, while not meeting the extreme contention of either par ty. gives to Great liritain a large share of the interior territory in dis pute and to Venezuela the entire mouth of the Orinoco, including iSarl mn Point and the Cnribbeau littoral for some distance to the eastward. The deeison appears to be equally satisfac tory to botli parties. Venezuela lias once more undergone li revolution. The insurgents, under General Castro, after a sanguinary en gagement, in which they suffered much loss, rallied in tile mountainous interior and advanced toward the cap ital. The bulk of the army having sided with the movement, President Andrnde quitted Caracas, where Gen eral Cnstro set up a provisional gov ernment with Which our minister and the representatives of other powers entered into diplomatic relations on the 20th of November, 1890. 

MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS Peace Conference--Treaties of Keo rocit'—OlMpiito Willi Tuikey. The president refers to the interna tional peace conference, and says: "The 'convention lor the pacific set tlement of international conflicts may be regarded as realizing the earnest dt-sire of great numbers of American c^tiz^ns, whose deep sense of justice, expressed in numerous resolutions nnd memorials, lias urged tli'em to labor for this noble achievement. The gen eral character of this convention, al ready signed by the delegates of more than twenty sovereign states, further commends.it. to the favorable action of the senate of the t'nited States, whose ratification it still awaits." lteciprocal trade arrangements ne gotiated with various nations are re ferred to, and the hope expressed that more treatiee will soon be consum mated. Claims against Turkey for injuries to American citizens are still causing trouble also arbitrary discrimination against. American products. On this point the message says: "In these, as in all instances, wher ever ocurring, when American prod ucts may be subjected in a foreign country, upon specious pretexts, to discrimination compared with the like products of another country, this gov ernment will use its earnest efforts to secure fair and equal treatment for its citizens and their goods. Failing this, it will not hesitate to apply whatever corrective may be provided by the statutes." The president recommends remedial legislation in the case of Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Eico, recommend ing a form of government similar to that in the case of the territory of Louisiana for Alaska and Puerto Itico. The work of the different depart ments is briefly reviewed nnd the recommendations Bf-the various heads are approved. The president devotes considerable space to the army operations, paying a high tribute to the volunteers. Some men would not claim to be self-made if they knew the terrible re Bponsibility they were undertaking. II1I iffe:-1r */*V* IS Members of the Fifty-Sixth House and Senate Called to Or der at Noon.

GALLERIES ARE PACKED Expectation of Dramatic Devel opments in the Roberts Case Augments Attendance. Hj| sS'i TAYLOR MAKES FORMAL JR0TEST fes Swearing In of th© Mormon Mem ber Inferred Pcniling Inves tigation by a Special Committee. Washington, Dec. 5—The opening of the Fifty-sixth congress Mon day attracted the widespread atten tion which always attaches to the an nual assembling of the national law makers. There was added interest in the event this year, for the many far reaching questions awaiting consid eration gave unusual importance to the return of congress. Aside from this, the Roberts ease introduced a phase which promised something out side "of the ordinary developments of the opening day. Early in the day throngs began converging at the cap itol. The outer doors were open to all, and through these flowed con tinuous-streams of humanity until the great corridors, galleries and rotundas were fairly packed. As early as 10:30 the conspicuous figures of congress began to "arrive, and this served to give the waiting throngs temporary diversion. General Henderson went direct to the speaker's private office, where he shared his time with the house, leaders und with those pleading for admission cards. Kepresentative Richardson, of Ten nessee, democratic house leader, was also early on the scene, conferring with his lieutenants. Shortly before 11 o'clock Mr. Rob erts, of Utah, in a silk hat and black frocii suit, made his way through the crowd to the members' private lobby, where he chanced to meet Mr. Rich ardson, and the two held a short con ference as to whether Mr. Roberts should seek to address the house. A buzz of commcnt followed the gentle man from Utah wherever he went, but there was no disrespectful demonstra tion. Scattered through the galleries were people prominent in the political, "fiOelhl -and-.financiai world. Very early .iaithe day a monster pe tition, said to consist -of 7,000,000 names, protesting against the seating of Roberts, was brought into the hall. It had Keen collected by New Vork newspapers. It consisted of twenty eight rolls of names, each about two feet in diameter, encased in an Amer ican flag. These rolls were stacked up in the area in front of the clerk's desk and were viewed with great curi osity. Later Major McDowell, clerk of the house, ordered all except two of the rolls taken out into the lobby. Outsiders Ordered lo Itoilre. At 11:30 the alerk directed those not entitled to the floor to retire, and of ficers and pages rapidly cleared out those already in. Conspicuous on the floor were old veterans—Payne of New York, leader of the majority General Grosvenor of Ohio, Hepburn of Iowa, Dalzell of Pennsylvania, Bni lcy of Texas, McClelland and Sulzer of New York. Senator Rawlins, of Utnli, came over from the senate wing' nnd held an earnest conference with Rob erts. Mr. Lenz, of Ohio, took part in the conference. After it. was over the re port was circulated that Roberts would not present, himself to be sworn in. But this was immediately denied. Roberts himself said he had not de cided what he would do, but that he might desire to be heard when his case came up. Mr. Taylor, of Ohio, who represents Mclvinley's district, who was to con duct the case against Roberts, -was conferring with Iiis colleagues on the republican side. Promptly at noon, after the invoca tion by the blind chaplain, Rev. Henry Cowden, the rending clerk began call ing. Roberts sat listening intently for his name, and when it was called he responded "Here" in a loud voice. But he looked nervous and ill at ease. There was no demonstration during the roll call. When it was concluded Clerk McDowell announced that, 352 members had answered to their names, a quorum. "The next, thing in order," an nounced the clerk, "is the election of a speaker." Mr. Hepburn, of Iowa, offered a res olution, which wns adopted, vive. voee, providing the house proceed to the election of a speaker for the Fifty sixth congress. Hemlersoii Elected Speaker. Thereupon Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, as chairman of the republican caucus, presented the name of David B. Hen derson, of Iowa. The mention of the name of General Henderson was greet ed with a round of applause from the republican side. Mr. Hay, of Virginia, chairman ol the democratic caucus, nominated James D. Richardson, of Tennessee, nnd his name drew the jjlaudits of the democratic side. Ridgley, of Kansas, nominated John C. Bell, of Colorado, as the populist candidate, and Wilson, of Idaho, placed Francis G. Newlands. of Ne vada, in nomination as the candidate of the silver party. Each party hav ing fmt forward its candidate, by di rection of the clerk the roll was called and each member voted for the candi date of his political affiliations. Mr. Taylor, of Ohio, has objected to swearing in of Roberts of Utah. Anti-lloberts Memorial, The formal memorial and protest against the admission of Brigliam H, Roberts to a seat in congress wns cir cuited in printed form and placed on the desks of members during the day. The main points.are that Roberts is not a citizen, since "nt. all times after 1883 he was and now is a bigamist and polyganiist" contrary to the low that he has been prosecuted and punished for "unlawful cohabitation with more than one woman thnt he was bom of British parents within the British realm and has never renounced l)issnl lcgiance to Queen Victoria. After re citing the legal" and moral oblections to Roberts the petition asks that he be A NEW FRENCH FLYER. Experiments With a Machine That Has Bncirclcd Eiffel Tower.

Formal objections to Roberts will also be presented today, but the understanding is that, the main question will go over. Repre sentative Richardson, the democratic flooir leader, says the understanding is definite and formal, but some repub lican members regard the procedure as doubtful.
