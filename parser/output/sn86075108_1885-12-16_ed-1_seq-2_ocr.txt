An active wheat market was experi enced in Minneapolis last week, not withstanding the prophecy that hard, frozen roads would cause the farmer to rapidly fill the elevators. . Attorney-General Garland says that Judge Coborn has no good cause to be surprised at his removal, as he has been furnished with a copy of ibe charges a galtet .him. The salary law passed by the legisla ture,last winter goes into effect Mon day the 21st inst., except as to the office of country treasurer, taking effect as to that office on the first Monday of March 1886. The law as it affected the assessor's office, went into force frAm anti after its passage.

Searlesas Col. Sellers at the las' press meeting. Aleck became the victim pf deep seated remorse, and it is thought that it was for this unfortunate Lapsus tinguie that he so suddenly left th HOtuitrj and chose suicide through the medium of a car bumper. It is surprising that Judge Coburn, after receiving notice through the paper» of his suspension from < ffice, went ahead with court business, putting Dawson county to a needless and inexcusable ex pense. The Judge, of course, knew that his suspension took effect at once. We look upon t he comments of the pres» Of the lower country 7 as unwarranted, in view of the fact that suspensions from office, means to vacate forthwith. One of the very first acts of Senato r Vest at the opening session of the Senate was in behalf of Montana. It was a bill to amend the sections of the revised statutes, relating to the Yellowstone Park, also to provide permanent reserva tions for the Indians in Northern Mop tana. The latter bill contemplates the cutting down of the vast areas now use lesslv held by Indians, and ojiening them to white settlers. It is pfeasing to note that the Chron icle has not hammered in vain at the proposition to enlarge Ft. Ellis, also that several of oar citizens have written to Senators and Congressmen asking their assistance in the matter. In the mean while» strong petition should be sent to our delegate requesting his assistance and securing his approval of a scheme that has for its end the advancement of Bozeman and the creation of a market for Gallatin valley produce. It. was reported in New York last week that the Northern Pacific had ordered thoir workmen on the proposed branch to.Butte via Gbrrison, to stop work, consequently the Union Pacific had also ordered their men on the branch to Helena to quit. In the meanwhilt Agent Stokes publicly announces that the Northern Pacific have only tempor arily suspended operations, awaiting warm weather, and a gentleman jus> from Darling informs us that from thre« to five hundred men are busily engaged there in grading the Union Pacifi« branch. The month of February will probably tell the tale, when the present pooling arrangement between the com panies will cease. . William Henry YtmiferOilt, of New York, the richest man in America and the wealthiest in the world, died Sud denly snd painlessly at his residence on the 8th inst., of apoplexy or cerebral hemorrhage, aged Bixty-four years and seven months. Mr. Vauderbilt's fortune a gn at part of which was inherited, i. eatimsted at $21)0,1)00,000. His iuconn was calculated as to) ows : 12,372,000 a year from government bonds, $7 305,00t from railway stocks, $576 605 from mis cellaneous securities ; total, over $10,00» - 000 a year, or $28,000 a day, $1,200 an hour, or $19.75 a minute. The deceased left a will, by which his large railroad interests will be managed by his sons, his confidential adviser, or some suitable Person selected by the heirs, w ho will do all possible to concentrât» the vast wealth, and avoid also the pann which would be créait d by an immedi ate division of the stocks or their tquiva* lent* in money. THE 

MESSAGE. Elsewhere we publish that portion of the President's message which more particularly interests us of the west. The m îssage, instead of being a marvel of brevity is unusually long, but by the time President Cleveland has written his eighth message, he will perhaps hive learned that golden newspaper rule of condensation and "Boil 'er down." Extreme paitisan papers, auch as the Pioneer Press join in stating that with out a single exception, the views of the President upon every one of the multi tude of subjects which he touches are wise ami sound. The document par takes ofthat flavor which pervaded the messages of old-time, early-day Presi dents. It is a candid comprehensive disquisition upon the affairs of this country that every citisen should read. In the matter of silver the President has not touched the popular chord, but he has made the strongest argument against silver coinage that could • have been made—an argument that will meet with tho combined antaganisui of all Demo crats in Congiess and all friends of the farming and laboring classes. He re commends (he appointment of six com tnis-ioners, three to be chosen from army circles, who shall investigate the Indian question in all its details, decid mg u|hui rruiuvirm »in* »11 piwvH<*l ij««» lions, as their different degrees of bar barism may prescribe. Such a commit tee, composed of practical men, experi em-eri with Indian affairs, with power and well-defined duties given them by Congress, would soon rescue our Indian policy from the rule of injustice to both Indian and white, into which it has fallen. The President speaks with no uncertain sound regarding the Mormon question, indicating a strong desire to see polygamy exterminated, and expres sing a determination on his part to en compass that end. The Chinese ques tion he views from a standpoint of justice to those who are in America, ami expresses a willingness to second am remedial measure of restriction within the treaty limits, which Congress in its w isdom may enact.
