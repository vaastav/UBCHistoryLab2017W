CIRCULATION WEEK ENDING DEC. 2nd, 1922 11,819 THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Dealing with a number of Important matters which have been brought con spicuously to the attention of the peo ple. President Hardlns In his messajic to congress puts due emphasis upon the situation that prevails as the result of prohibition. It Is notorious, as he points out, the way in which the law of th.3 land is disregarded and it remains to be seen whether there is going to be respect for the law or whether the law must be modiBed. Whether it will be possible to get a proper enforcement of the law as the result of the conference with governors which he is to call Is uncertain. It isn't a. case of what the governors may personally think about prohibition, for It Is to be realized that there are wet ones as well as dry ones and yet in view of the fact that a fed eral law exists concerning intoxicants the proper cooperation of the states in Its enforcement Is to be expeoted, quite the same as in the case of any other federal law. The aim of the presidsnt Is therefore correct Either the taw should be enforced, or it should bo changed. The conditions prevailing at the present time with lax enforcement and bootleg and otner liquors being ob tainable in most any quantity Tor tnv price Is deplorable. The recommendation for the abolition it the railway labor board and to have Its work transferred to the interstate Sonrraei'ce commlssior with authority to enforce Its decisions comes as the result Bf tl.e recent railroad strike where tn? handicaps 'thrown about the board w-e tully disclosed. THE 

&TJBSIDY BUX. Actuated. by the best of reasons was President Harding when he made it known to the senate committee that he would prefer the killing of the ship subsidy bill entirely ' rather than tho passage of it with she provision restrict ing the subsidy payments to annual ap propriations by congress. By the bill a ten year subsidy was provided for. By the amendment re stricting the expenditures to the action of congress each year the bill is crip pled and it is impossible to look upon the amendment as having been offered with any cither intention. II can be appreciated that no shltpping concern s going to enter business, and no capital is going to be attracted to shipping ac tivities through subsidy legislation if ! Is going to be necessary to depend up on the action of congress each year. There is plenty of evidence of the sit uation in which those depending upon such legislation would be placed, when consideration is given to the filibuster aotivitles which have marked the re cent special session of congress and which may even be pursued in regard to the subsidy bill. If there is going to be any encour agement given to shipping through th proposed legislation there must be as surance that it will be positive through a certain period. The idea of subject Ing business' to the whims of congress from year to year is ridiculous. The thing to do is as the president suggests. Any lukewarm attitude that permits a measure that blocks the very thing that is aimed at is worse than nothing at all. Instead of putting forth a subsidy bill that can never amount to anything let it be killed. There should be one thing or the oth er. E:ther we should take action for the purpose of bolstering up and pro tecting our merchant marine for the benefit it will be to the nation, or else we should get rid of them and end that heavy yearly loss which is now saddled on the government for' a lot of Idle snips. Playing politics with it will only made a bad situation worse. THE MAN WHO 

TALKS The great migrations of the world have felways formed an important part of hu man history. They nave been remarkable. first of all, for moving generally In a westward direction. This has been true from the time when Abraham Journeyed from the land of the Chaldees to the latest steerage passengers from Slovakia to New York. It Is likewise true that the. primary object of all these migrations has been the search for bread : the better ment of physical conditions. Hence we find, what we might naturally expect, that they are for the most part those best calculated tp do the world's manual labor. These peoples have found the United States a sort of El Dorado because COMMANDER WILD'S EXPOSITION INTO ANTARCTIC London, Noy. IS Commander Frank Wild, who succeeded Sir Ernest Shac kleton as leader of the Quest expe dition to the Antartic, lecturing be-' fore the Royal Geographical society in London on the work accomplished, explained the difficulties encountered during every fetage of the expedition, largely owing to the compulsory ob jective from the Arctic to the Ant arctic.

These migrations from Europe have bees a necessary national asset. Aayone aeanalute srW the history of uur common labor will realize how large ly we have depended on the Immigrant. It is within the memory of men now in middle life when the Irish were oiainly ply. , Commander Wild said when the late Sir Ernest SnacKleton first con ceived the idea of another expedition It was the Arctic that he intended to explore. There is a large unexplored area: known as the Beaufort Sea, and It was the exploration of thite that he made his aim. The scheme was natur ally one which much interested the Canadian government, one reason be ing that fears were entertained that the Danes, who controlled Greenland, might cross the narrow straits sep- those who wielded the pickaxe and shovel, j fating it from Ellesmere Land, and Later years have shown here in no in- f""""" iwf considerable numbers Lithuania..

'Engine Trouble After describing the elaborate equipment of the Quest, Commander Wild said: "The expedi tion left London on Sept. 17, 1921. The strikes which occurred to prevent the putting in of oil engines proved to be a great) misfortune, for soon alter we had started we had engine trou ble, which compelled adjustment at Lisbon, Madeira and St. Vincent, and cauteed considerable delay. .We reach ed St. Paul's Rock on Nov. 8. The ship was immediately surrounded by num bers of sharks. We effected a landing which was difficult on account -of the swell. Wilkins and Marr made bio logical collections and took photo graphs of birds and fish. Douglals and Dell carried out an accurate survey and made a geological examination of the island. Hussey and Carr did me teorological work Further engine trouble caused Sir Ernest to put into Rio de Janeiro for another complete overhaul. This con sumed a month of valuable time, and compelled an alteration of the pro gram. It was now impettslble to visit Cape Town and reach the ice in time for the season. Sir Ernest decided to proceed straight to South Georgia, and go direct to the ice. Our special equip ment and 'clothing was at Cape Town, and an amount of scientific gear. This we had to do 'without.

In th6 past year according to the r port of the postmaster general there have been introduced economies which have resulted in the cutting of the de partment deficit by $20,000,060. That doesn't show that it has been conduct ed so that expenditures and receipts balance. That is in fact a department where deficits are more likely than sur pluses because of the very fact that if! is operated for the purpose of giving the people of this country postal ser vice, and service Is far more important than a surplus. When the aim is only a surplus the service suffers. Not only increased economy but greater efficiency has beep the aim of the postmaster general.

Mr. Walpole In Ms IstoreeUiur lector of Nov. 87 told of a lady riding in the same compartment as himself who started to read a book that seemed to Interest her. Glancing at the book, he found that It was one of his own. Naturally he was interested, too. The first several pages were carefully read. Then Interest seemed to lose somewhat of its tension. Pages began to he turned more rapidly. Then she began to scowl and show iri dignation. At last she threw the book across the . compartment In anger, re marking that "the man who wrote that book ought to be shot.". Mr. Walpole did not express any surprise at the woman's conduct. He probably sensed the situa tion in its true light that no book was Mr. Rowett, when he learned of the situation, generoifely undertook the full financial responsibility, for he felt that the advantages to science ould be considerable. By this time it was too late to catch the open Arctic sea son, and so Sir Ernest evolved plans for an expedition into the Antarctic and sub-Antal-ctio areas. This meant a considerable change of general or ganization, gear and equipment, yet 8dch was his driving energy that it was all carried out and completed within three months. He realized. however, that his ship, the Quest, which had been eminently suitable for the northern expedition, was not so suitable for the cruise in southern waters.

The message Is one that deals with matters of vital national Importance rod congress if It assumes Its responsi billty will give them careful considera lion and early action In keeping with tnelr importance.

It may take the form of an attempt to get the assembly to call upon congress to mod ify the Volstead act to secure a larger alcoholic content In permissible drinks. And may I suggest that the essential question here hi this, "Is alcohol of any degree of content fit to drink 7" or coo- j Crete ly, as to the particular proposition of some, "Are 'light wines and beer" fit ! to drink?"
