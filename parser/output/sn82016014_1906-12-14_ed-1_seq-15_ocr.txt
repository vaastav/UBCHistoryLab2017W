SUPREL1E; President ' Will Send a Special Message to Congress Asking for the Abrogation of Certain State Itights. THE CALIFOltXIA ISSUE Has Afforded Him a Basis for Contemplated Action. Desires to Establish a Jlore Centralized Government. Chicago, Dec. 14. A dispatch to the Record-Herald from Washington says: A special message on the Japanese question and the California school problem supplementary to the treat ment of these same subjects by Presi dent Roosevelt in his regular message last week will be sent to congress from the White House next Tuesday. It is stated authoritatively this special mes sage will be more vigorous in tone than the former communication and will r.ot be calculated to cool the indignation of Californians previously aroused. The special message moreover, aside from Its local application will be one of the most notable and important communications in the entire list of those sent to congress by the present executive It will bring to a decisive issue the centralization scheme of the government which is likely to form the climax of endeavor on the part of the Roosevelt administration. - - - . The administration is about to take advanced ground regarding the doc trine of the federal supremacy over state sovereignty. The Japanese ques tion raised in connection with the pub lic school system of California has sup plied the opportunity to give forcible expression to the mighty scheme of centralization that is to be perfected if possible. Accompanying his message, which it is understood will be a full explanation of the administration's projected policy as to the supremacy of federal over state power, will be the report of the special Investigation of the California school question made by Secretary of Commerce and Labor Metcalf. Re gardless of the nature of this report, the president will adhere vigorously to the position taken by him in his regu lar message, which was written before he left Washington to visit the canal zone and before he had anything at all from Secretary Metcalf. But as to the Metcalf report it has been learned that its author found much to condemn in the matter of the treatment of Japanese outside of the school question. His report, in fact, will furnish a new sensation. It will show, it is understood, labor union tyranny over Japanese which affects the rights held to be theirs b ytreaty in even mere pronounced manner than anything connected with the school imbroglio. . 

GRAND OPERA BARGAIN. George Crampton's Scheme for a Xj cenni Course Opera Troupe. George Crampton, the head of the concert company whie appeared at the Auditorium last nifit, is preparing to organize for next season a grand opera troupe to play under the man agement of lyceum bureaus on a finan cial basis which the lyceum course can afford to accept. This is an entire ly new feature for the lyceum course, and Mp. Crampton believes thatit will be a winning scheme. The various lvceum bureaus have taken about $10,000 stock in the enter prise, and the plan is to organize a company of eight or ten people, equip it with stage settings suitable for the class of entertatnmnets which it is pro posed to give, and present several well known grand operas in English. The concert given by the Internation al Grand company at the Auditorium Thursday night, as the fifth number of the pipe organ course, was one of the strongest concert programmes which has been given in Topeka under a lyceum management. George Crampton. who has sung in Topeka before, is the basso and head of the company. His singing last night pleased the audience. John Heath, the-pianist with the company, is a nephew of H. A. Heatli of the Kansas Farmer in this city. One of the leading musicians of the city gave it as her opinion that Mr. Heath is entitled to rank, with the best pian ists that have ever visited Topeka The violinist, muc .jotho morel, was one of the strong features of the programme. muc. :imv,.c. was brought to this country, from France by Calve, and when Calve s company disbanded, and Mme. Calve became mixed up in the alleged en eaeement to marry a blind American millionaire, Mile. Verrnorel was loan ed" to the Crampton company by the Calve management. Mile. ermorel gets $100 per week, but the old Calve management is paying part of it in or der to hold her under reserve until next season, when the Calve company will reorganize. The soprano, Miss Peyton,- is an Oklahoma City girl, young and beauti ful and possessed of a voice which musicians predict will be one of the greatest In the country. 

SEAT SAlTff AYILL. OPES MONDAY. Ellen Beach Y'avv Entertainment at the Auditorium Thursday. Much is said by those promoting the financial end of an entertainment, that borders on the realms of extrava gance Tho merits of an entertain ment to come are usually exaggerated, and the faults passed over in silence. The following, however is taken from the columns of the Musical Review, published in San Francisco, one of the foremost musical Journals of the coun try, and written by Alfred Metzger. a musical critic of national renown, and written after a concert by Ellen Beach Taw jriven ihis season in San Fran cisco: ' , "Personally I have always preferred the dramatic art of declamatory sing ing to the lighter form of lyric colora ture. But there certainly is a place for this exquisite art in musical life, and it is the duty of the musical pub lic to recognize it to the full extent and recognize it so much more- be cause its exponents are becoming ex tinct, and there are so very few com ing before the world who take their places. Athoush it my be a sad stat of affairs to be compelled to confess that the great exponents of the art of colorature singing are gradually dis appearing from the artistic horizon,, it is nevertheless an accomplished fact, and for this reason it is our duty to di rect our glances toward the rising stars who are destined, to walk In. the m HlSCELLASEOliS AOS. -XjV-- UKAL ESTATE TUANSFKUS.

In Ellen Beach Yaw we have the genuine, pure lyric sPra"-a voice which stands alone in the clear n3 of its hisher register and In us effectiveness of obtaining the genuine lvric results. I may say Miss Taws voice is unioue for its limpidity and mellow oualitv. That Miss Yaw be sides this" dainty, limpid upper register the helg-ht of which seems almost unfathomable has at the same time cultivated a resonant, solid lower reg ister shows the splendid force of in telligence which she has brought to bear uion- her musical education. I have never heard a, voice of Miss Yaw's delicacy and height - that exhibited such a sonorous lower register, and herein as far as my personal knowl edge is concerned Miss Yaw's voice stands alone in the world.' Permit me to recapitulate: Miss Yaw's voice is absolutely unique in the fact that it possesses" a higher range of singular delicacv and limpidity coupled with a lower register of adequate sonority and resonance. Then there runs through the voice a silver thread of bell-like vibratory power -that makes it exceedingly receptive to the more .sensitive musical ear."..-."u i Miss Yaw aingsriiw the Auditorium next Thursday, under the auspices of the organ association . ; The seat sale opens Monday morning at 8 o'clock at Stansfield's.
