The report of Secretary of War Wright is particularly interesting at this time, when, with peace declared with Japan and tho country on most amicable terms with all the powers of the world, there is a strong sentiment in congress in favor of cur tailing the usual appropriations for tho maintenance and Improvement of the service. Secretary Wright "makes an effort to convince the congress that an urgent necessity exists for Improv ing his branch of the service, however peaceful conditions at home and abroad may be. The army is not maintained alone for fighting purposes. The year's record shows that one soldier was wounded in the Philippines. He re covered and that is the sum total of the list of casualties chargeable to actual conflict. The army, however, has been building roads in Alaska, deepening canals and straightening rivers in various parts of 'the nation, building fortifications at seaports and other army posts, and in general do ing much more building than fighting. In a general way, the army has done well in the last year. The enlistments have brought the strength of the" force up to within a few hundred of the number authorized, although there is still a marked shortage 1n the num ber of officers. Secretary Wright asks that 612 additional! officers be provi ded, in the interest of the efficiency of the service. . ' The need of increasing the National Guard is urged by the secretary. He explains that In the event of a War with any first-class power,' we would need at least 350,000 men for the first lino of defense, and that, a the stand ing army is limited to "100,000,' it would be necessary to draw upon the country for 250,000 fighters. To se cure this, he recommends that con gress make more liberal appropria tions for the support and strengthen ing of the National Guard in the vari ous states. He asks also for addi tional appropriations for the seacoast defenses, the improvement of the sig nal corps and other expenses for for tifications, repairs and extensions at various posts. It is difficult, in a time of profound peace, to interest the average Ameri can in the affairs and developments of the regular army, but it is pleasing, nevertheless, to learn that the Ameri can soldiers are the best equipped force of fighting men on earth and that more of them can be had when ever they are wanted for actual war fare. THE FUTURE , OF DEMOCRACY. The announcement that ' Mr. Bryan Is to hold conferences with demo cratic leaders in New York. Washing ton and other parts of the east within the next few weeks Is accepted ns no tice that he Is already preparing to take a look over the field for 1912 and to determine what action, if any, it will bo necessary for Mm to taki to counteract the open efforts that are being exerted to eliminate him' from consideration as a candidate in the next presidential election. The fight for the control of the party organization in 1912 is already in progress. Secretary Urey Woodson of Kentucky and Chairman Norman E. Mck of New York have had an open . row and each will open bead quarters to begin tho work of organis ing for the campaign four years away. Mr. Mack will have his headquarters in New York City, while Mr. Woodson ill operate from Louisville. Mr. Mack, in a recent interview, declared thatvMr. Bryan, in his belief, would not bo considered as a candidate in 1912 and Mr. Woodson retorts that tho great living, throbbing, unterrlfled body of the democracy is still true to Bryan and that be must be considered and consulted in tho future plans for the party Mr. Bryan may find some peculiar significance in the fact that he is be ing left, out of some of the important democratic meetings scheduled for the early part of the coming year. The Iroquois club of Chicago, in planning Its dinner in celebration of Jackson day, January 8, has Invited Governor Tom Marshall of Indiana, Governor Judson Harmon of Indiana and Gov ernor John Johnson of Mlune"tj as its honor guests and principal speak era. Tho invitation to Mr. Bryan has not been lsued. Tammany ia also preparing for a big celebration of Jackson day and it is understood that Mr. Bryan has been left out of it, while special attention is to bo paid to distinguished democrats from the south. " All indications, therefore, aro that as soon as the holiday celebration is over there will be some active doings In the democratic ranks. The Iroquois club and Tammany must not get ths Bryan by refusing to Invite him to oa and speak at their dinners. New York and Chicago are not the only towns on the map where Jackson day will be celebrated. Mr. Bryan will speak somewhere and what he says will be accepted as a guide to future action by the large army of Bryanites. He will have to be consulted or those who reject his counsels will have to pay the penalty. ' A BILLIOX A TEAR. Congressman Theodore Burton of Ohio, without question the best in formed man in America on the na tion's waterways, makes the some what startling assertion that the United States could save $1,000,000,- 000 a year by making provision for the proper conservation of the na tion's waterways. Mr. Burton Is not a radical, but, on the contrary, is recognized as one of the most con servative men in public life. He has been chairman of the house commit tee., on rivers and harbors for many years and has personally inspected every Important stream in tho coun try and has given years of study and Investigation to existing conditions and feasible plans for their improve ment. His views must, therefore, be given much greater weight than would be accorded the expressions of an en thusiast. Mr. Burton's conclusions are based on statistics compiled in the gather ing of data for tho report of the In land Waterways commission, of which he Is chairman. He argues that the Improvement of the waterways would effect a direct savings to the people of $250,000,000 a year in freight charges; an annual saving in flood damage of $150,000,000; a saving in forest fires of at least $26,000,000; an annual saving through cheapened power of $75,000,000, and an annual saving in soil erosion (or correspond ing benefit through increased farm production) of $500,000,000; ai total of $1,000,000,000 a year, or about $12.60 per capita. To these benefits Mr. Burton adds the other advantages added by the extension of the irri gated districts, the draining of swamp lands and from a purified and cheap ened water supply with consequent diminution of disease and saving of human life. While exception may be taken to some of Mr. Burton's figures and esti mates, he must be given credit for first having, placed in tangible form, placing a money value thereon, the benefits to be derived from an. intelli gent and systematic improvement of the nation's rivers. He shows that the saving certain to result from the work would be twenty times greater than the cost of the improvement, which 'has been placed at $500,000, 000 a year for ten years. But Mr. Burton uses figures gathered from official sources to support his . esti mates. He shows that the cost of water transportation 'averages about one-fourth of that of rail carriage and, based on the tonnage figures of the railroads for 1906, would result In a saving of $250,000,000 a year. The $500,000,000 which he asserts is lost each year by soil erosion is based on statistics of the geological survey, showing the amount of soil annually washed into the rivers by floods and freshets. , To this must be added the reduction in crop production caused by the loss of this top soil. He shows that there are nearly 80,000,000 acres of most fertile lands in the nation that are now valueless because of the flooded condition of the territory in which they are located. This would make a wonderfully rich addition to the crop-producing area of the coun try If the waters were properly con served and the floods prevented. A significant feature of the report Is Mr. Burton's estimate that the in come derived from power developed for the improvement of navigation would, at the current market rates, amount to s&oo.qoo.ooo a year, or enough to pay the cost of the pro posed improvements. Mr. Burton's report makes it evident that nothing could be done that would effect a larger net profit to the whole people than the carrying out of the plans of the Inland Waterwava commission. ' The value of the corn crop of the United States this year, according to Secretary Wilson's report, Is nearly one and three-quarter billions of do! lars, "enough to cancel the Interest bearing debt of the United States and to pay for the Panama canal and fifty battleships." And yet some unln formed persons turn up their cultured noses at King Corn. i , If Lincoln wishes to adopt the com mission form of government no one in Omaha will object, and it is unfair for a Lincoln newspaper to insinuate that Omaha people are trying to Interfere with Lincoln's system of local govern ment, and Omaha would appreciate it It the Lincoln folks would return the compliment in kind. The German kaiser hai been in vited to guard his tongue, and French naval officer has been dis missed for talking too much. Punish ment for this sort of offense is thus far confined entirely to European countries. The fact that Milton received but $25 for the manuscript of "Paradise Lost" simply shows that the maga zines did not pay any better in his days than they do now. Tho exchange of visits between Omaha and Council Bluffs Is like a call of neighbor oa neighbor. It Just so happens that each city is at present conducting a great exposition of na tional Importance, and this is what gives tho affair its little air of formality. Holland declares that its capture of a Venezuela guard ship "roust not bo construed as an unfriendly act to ward Venezuela." It would bo inter esting to observe what tho Dutch would do if they achieved a sudden affection for Castro and his people. The railroads have not done exactly the right thing by the Corn show. An exhibition that means so much in the way of potential traffic for the western transportation lines certainly deserves greater encouragement than tho Ne braska railroads are giving it. A Pittsburg minister describes that city as "at place of fragile morality, offending millionaires, bridge whist and automobiles." It is possible that more than that could be seen in Pitts burg if there was ever a clear day there. Omaha will bo asked to entertain great many visitors this week and no effort should bo spared to make the stay of the strangers pleasant. The city has a good reputation tor hospitality and this must be main tained. If a few more women follow Mrs. Catt'a example of abusing tho presi dent it may be necessary to start a Sapphlra club, to keep company with the Ananias club. The corn crop is worth $1,000,000,- 000 more than it was in 1896 because we have more of it. The value of the egg crop has increased because we have none of it. Bulgaria offers Turkey $16,000,000 to recognize its Independence. Is there anything the sultan of Turkey would not do for that amount of real money? It develops that chewing gum Is one of the by-products of the Standard Oil. If Judge Laodls had known that he would probably have doubled that fine. Amateur Oasarry, Chicago Record-Herald.

CONVICTION OK BOSS HUES. Dispels a False laapreaslom Concrrs last Sun Fraaelaco. San Francisco Chronicle. The conviction of iRuef on the charge of offering a bribe to ex-Supervisor John J. Furey to vote for a trolley franchise to the United Railroads company will go far to remove an Impression prevalent at the east, and for the creation of which a sec tion of our own community Is largely re sponsible. There never was the slightest doubt In the mind of any Intelligent San Franciscan concerning the guilt of the ac cused boss. His disgraceful manipulation of a weak and venal mayor, and of the predatory board of supervisors for whose nomination he waa responsible, and whoss election was secured during one of the tem rornry aberrations to which large com munities are subject, was too patent to permit a doubt to exist for a moment. There was absolutely none, and If consensu of opinion were sufficient to convict, Abe Ruef would have been wearing stripes long ago. About the guilt of the accused there was no doubt That he was a man who shrank from no scheme by which he might line his pockets there Is not tha slightest ques tion. Tha evidence that he was responalbln for nearly all the rascality which afflicted San Francisco during the time he waa In power may not atand legal scrutiny, but It Is convincing . enough to satisfy everyone who has followed his carter. But despite this opinion, whtcb is shared by an over whelming majority of the community, t ere has from the beginning, been a fear that the technicalities of the law, and tha un scrupulous methods of4 his defenders, who have not hesitated to employ every method, legal and Illegal, to help iHelr client, might result In a miscarriage of Justice.

Mlaer Sooaso laeldeats Sketch a tho Spot. General Charles F. Manderaon of Omaha, while In Washington last week, talked with a Washington Herald reporter about Vlos President-elect Sherman'a qualifica tions for presiding officer of the senate and related an Incident of Ma own ex perience In that line. "When I became a member of ths senate, said General Man dnrson, "I waa quite a young man years old. I waa not only young, but was also Inexperienced so far as parliamentary rulea In a body like the United States senate were concerned. "You can picture, therefore, my discom fiture when one day old Bassett you re member, he with the long whiskers cams up to me, making his courteous bow and informing me that Senator Edmunds re quested me to take ths chair. Protests availed nothing, and I simply went up to Senator Edmunds and told him that I had absolutely no experience and knowledge of the rules and parliamentary usages gov erning ths senate. " 'Young man, said the senator, looking straight at me, 'there Is no place Ilka this chair to learn parliamentary laws.' "There waa nothing left for me but to take tha chair. "In this connection I must say that I broke the record In the senate, aa I believe I was the only presiding officer who ever was elected unanimously by both political parties represented In tho upper house. I had absolutely no Idea that I ever waa considered. John Sherman was ths chair man of the republican caucus and Senator Gorman led the democratic senators. "Meeting Benator Sherman coming from his committee room, Senator Gorman aaked him as to the candidate the republican cau cus had agreed upon for a preaidlng officer. Senator Manderaon,' replied Sherman. Senator Gorman expressed his satisfaction and approval and said the democrats would not only not nominate a candidate, but would support me, thus electing me unani mously. I was presiding officer of the senate for four years." A correspondent of the Brooklyn Eagle reports that ths basing of Benator Cum mins of Iowa has begun. Shortly after he had been sworn in as ths successor to the lata William William B. Allison, one of the senate attaches approached him and said: "Senator, you have been assigned to of fice room 146." Seator Cummins started out to find room 145. Hs finally located It In the extreme northeast comer of the house of repre sentatives office building, about one-half a mile from the senate chamber. For some unknown reason, no room In tha capttol or the numerous annexes to the senate was aet aside for his use. Apparently, ths mem bers of the steering committee are anxious to locate Senator Cummins as far from the seat of action aa possible. They feel In stinctively that the new man from Iowa Is going to make trouble for them with bis new-fangled progreaalve Ideas. Cummins Is seriously thinking of hiring an automobile to convey him from his faraway office room to ths senate when needed In a hurry. Without a swift con veyance of this so(4 It would be a physical Impossibility for him to reach the senate from his office room In time to answer a roll call. This process requires about eight minutes, and It would take a Dorando to cover the distance beween the offices In that brief period of time. Cummins Is ex pecting another Jolt when his committee assignments ars announced. 1 There Is a suspicion that the older senators will per petrate a Joke on Cummins like the one they sprang on, LsFollette when they made ths latter the chairman of the committee on Investigation of. the Potomac river front. The Washington correspondent of tha St Louis Republic points out that Champ Clark's elevation to the minority leader ship marks the first formal election of a member to that position In the history of congress. Heretofore the nominee of the minority members for speaker of the house has been accepted as the minority leader. This was the caae with John Sharp Wil liams; who has resigned nls leadership be cause hs Is soon to retire from the bouse preparatory to taking his seat In the sen ate. Everything about Champ Clark Is big. Hs Is big In avoirdupois, big nf heart big of voice and he has a big and abiding faith In the democratic party. Outside of the democratic party he loves Missouri best. The biggest thing about Clark Is his voice. His oratory la ths noisiest In con gress. As a hired hand on a farm he learned how to yell for the cattle. He practices this art on the republicans now. As a lawyer he Is at home as a cross examiner. Ha can browbeat and bulldoze a wltnesa to tho point where the witness will tell the truth If it kills him. The new minority leader is 68 years old and was born in Kentucky. He is a tan, handsome man with square shoulders and a big, deep ' chest He takes up three or four aisles and most of ths space In the well of the house when hs makes a speech. When he Is through he Is blowing Uks a por poise and mopping his bald head with a red-bordered handkerchief. Clark, too. has the power to command, while Williams has the power only to re quest Clark can daunt and Intimidate a crowd that would run over Williams. As permanent chairman of the St Louis con vention of 1904, Clark absolutely fright ened a rampant gallery mob that was try ing to run ths convention, and had been doing It while Williams was In the chair The insolence that comes from knowl edge of one's power, and that would be r aented if the power were not behind It lever offends when Clark displays It, as he delights In doing. Once, for Instance a rash republican, seeking the limelight made an attack on Clark. The giant Mia- sourtan came back with a ha'f-hour speech, which tore the rash republican limb from limb. At the finish of the half-hour, dur ing which the democrats had applauded rapturously and even the republicans had laughed because they couldn't help It Clark strode down the aisle toward his flushed and uncomfortable baiter, and rent the welkin with this climax: "Mr. Chairman, a few years ago a ten derfoot went out west looking for a grizzly He was all togged out In the newest style of hunting suit and dawned like an In credible vision on the astonished Inhab itants west of ths Missouri. He asked them where ha could find a grizzly, and they told blm reverently that at a certain place not far from there grizzlies were numerous and would come If you whistled Light-heartedly he took hla way to the place indicated, ' and two days later the burled his mangled remains in the local cemetery. Over his Innocent young head they erected a tombstone whereon thej J rudely carved tins epuapn: " 'lis whistled for the grizzly, and ths grtszry came." Klaarpla the World's Scheme.
