ALEXANDRIA: I.MI5H- ? THURSDAY MORNING, December G, 1S60. Congress.-?The Senate, yesterday, occu pied the greater portion of its session, in the discussion of the present aspect of public ufiuirs; several resolutions of interest were introduced and laid over. The House of Representatives passed the Homestead bill, and the Military Academy and Pension Ap propriation bills. We have been favored, says the Journal of Commerce;->with the following letter from lion. A. II. Stephens, of Georgia, to a friend, a resident of New York: '?The great and loading object airnod at bv ine In Mille i^cville was to produco harmony, oil a right line of policy. If the worn comes to the worst, as j ic may, and our State has to quit the Union, it is l of the utmost importance that all our people should I bo united cordially in this course. This, I feel j -?onrident, can only be effected on th9lineof policy i I indicated. But candor compels me to say that I ' am not without hope that our rights may be main tained and our wrongs be redressed, in the Union, i If this can be done, it is my earnest wish. I think also that it is the wish of a majority of cur people, i If, rafter making an effort, we shall fail, then all ; our people will be united in making or adopting the last resort, the "Ultima ratio regum." Even j in that case, I should look with great apprehen- j j-.i'Vi as to the ultimate result. When this Union ;>? dissevered, if of necessity it must be, I seo at present but litilo prospect of good government af I . rwards. -.-1' the \orth, / feci confident, anttrchy nil/soon ensue. And whether we shall be better o;f at the South will depend upon many things that I am not now satisfied that we have any as w:: ranee of. Revolutions are much easier started than controlled, and the men who begin tnem even tor i'u.: best purposes and objects, seldom end them." In the same letter, Mr. Stephens adds these words of truth, and wisdom"? "Human passions are like the winds; when aroused, they sweep everything before them in their fury. The wise and the good who may attempt to control them, will themselves most likely become the victims. This has boen the history of the downfall of all Republics. The selfish, the am bitious and the bad will generally tako the lead.? When the moderate men who are patriotic have | gone ::s far as thev think right and proper, aud ! propose to reconstruct, then will be found a class V>elow them, governed by no principle, but person- i i! objects, who will be for pushing matters further and further, until thoso who sowed the wind will rind that tf.c-y have reaped tho whirlwind. These arc my serious apprehensions. They are founded upon the experience of the world and the philoso phy of human nature, and no wise man should condemn them. To tear don n and build up again, are very different things; and before tearing down ..-von a bad government- we should first s*je a good prospect for bidding up a better. These are rny vi?iws candidly given. If there is one sentiment j in my breast strouger than all other*, it is an oar nest desire for the peace, prosperity and happiness oi'our people?that peace, prosperity and happi ness which a wirfe and good government alone can secure.'' The report of the Secretary of the Trea snry ia confined entirely to a Statement of the finances of the Government. The reve rse is insufficient to meet the general expen ses of the government and the maturing in debtedness. Of the recent ten million loan over one million has not been taken up by the bidders, and the negotiation at par of the remaining eloven millions of the loan author ized by the act of June 22, I860, is impossi ble in the prevailing condition of the coun try. The treasury is seriously embarrassed by this inability to negotiate the loan, and by the fact that treasury notes part, due are rapidly coming in, whilst those not due are paid in tor customs, thus depriving the gov ernment of Its principal source of revenue. To rescue the government from its financial embarrassments, the Secretary urges Con gress to authorize the issue of treasury notes to the amount of ten millions of dollars, se cured by a pledge of the revenue arising from tho sale ol public lands for their re demption. The Secretary renews his re commendation of the revision and consolida tion of the revenue laws; urges the general use of steam vessels in the revonue marine service, aud the transfer of the service itself to the Navy Department. Tho permanent public* debt on the 30th June last amounted to *4o,079,203.08. and the treasury drafts at the jiime date to $19,GOO,500. H 'v. Mr. Pyrie, in his sermon, on Thanks giving Pay, in Washington, thus beautifully and eloquently referred to the late Joseph Gales, of that city : ? '?One t^ague ha? in the last year boon silenccd, which for fifty years spake forth its words of pa rriut counsel. In this day of rebuke how well it is to think ot sueli a inau as Joseph Gales) Here <.n this u.y how becoming it is to tlrnk of bite : ivr tho iast time that venerable foot crossed thin ti'-.esbohi was on the la*tThanksgiving day.

That cannot be a ij.i i time <>r age which honored aud sustained such njiiiiu. The spirit of iue land which he addressed :;,:d o-ilightoried is not dead, though it may smu t - slumber; and my own faith aud horo involun f.-.i;!y revurt to aud are strengthened by what he once s iid to me, as what he was pleased te con sidvr as a kind of summary of my own life, bui which I verily believe was a rule of his: "To believe in true things. hope and labor for good things, and to keep on telling men what i.i good and true.'* May we ever remember and hon?r inui." The National Intelligencer claims that the president's doctrines on the "right" of seces* *ion, a v those which it has always advoca ted itiid enforced. The Washington Con stitution speaks favorably of the calm, dis >"> iTfionate, and patriotic tone of the Mes Ontldsux's BowJ-.s.?Brown & Tvggard, Boston, have late!,- published a n,;p jer cf s^iall volumes, b? : ititully printed an.i hand somely b>und, 'e?i?>r?ea for ihb us-,- of the young of both sei*e8, who ?: fond of reading, and co whom an ihrer?' > ? book would be ! an acceptable gift, nor. highly prized than vo . >.

NBWS OF THE DAY. u To show the very age and body oj the ti mes. The condition of iiieUoited States Treasu ry is such that the treasurer is compelled to decline paving requisitions upon him for the government's current expenses?paying at si<rht only such as must bo so paid to insure the continued transaction of the public busi ness, and withholding payment of the balance until the treasury may have more means at command. The Star says: "We hear of very heavy amounts in requisitions on various accounts thus held over at the Department, involving among other things the non-pay ment of the wages of sailors. <->>, too, las the treasurer been forced to decline accoi in- to the officers of Congress at this time sufficient to liquidate the dues to the members of that body." One of the New York papers states that its i editor has been called upon by a body of seaman from the frigate Savannah of the I Home Squadron, and now at the Brooklyn navy yard, who complain that the ship has been put out of commission and the crew discharged. They also say that upwards of $00 000 is due them in sums varying trom fifty to live huudred dollars, but that no steps i have yet been taken to pay them off. I he . consequence is they are obliged to submit to the extortions of their boarding-house keep ! eis, &e. ; The Postmaster General has ordered, that ' hereafter an examination be made at least i once a month, to ascertain all cases of post* I masters failing promptly to execute their ! bonds. In reference especially to the larger 'offices these examinations and reports will ! be'made at once on reasonable time for exe ! eutions having elapsed after the appoint ments are made. The Union men anticipate happy effects at the South from the President's powerful argu ment against secession, but neither the pub lic or private interpellations of members t rom the gulf States justify belief that such will be the result. On the contrary, it it still re garded as a fixed fact, by most intelligent politicians, that several ot the cotton States will secede. Savs the Louisville democrat, the most | fortunate man that we know ofnow-a-days is Sharpe, the maker of rifles. The South ern ultras and the abolitionists are eaoh buy ing them. We have an idea that he looks upon the present difficulties with the pious resignation that an undertaker does upon a prevailing epidemic. Two of the Baltimore city papers, the American and Exchange, ran a locomotive express for the purpose of conveying the President's Message from Washington.? The "iron horse'7 came through in forty-six minutes and brought large editions of the message. The eager demand of the public was quickly supplied. Among die passengers arrived at New York on Monday, in the steamer Northern Light, from California, were the lion. Re verdy Johnson and wile, of Baltimore: Sena tors Benjamin, Gwin and Baker, Col. Landei, Maj. Wyse and a number of other army ohi eers. The President reiterates his opinion in favor of a revision of the present taritt, and advocates the substitution of specific instead of ad valorem duties on all imported articles to which the former can be properly ap plied. .. ." In respect to what is said by the 1 resi dent about the forts near Charleston, it may I be added that the Secretary of War has de ! clarea that he intends t<? deliver over all forts intact to his successor. A number ofthe workingmen of Hartford, Conn., arc expected to visit Washington with the intention of presenting a beautiful cane, of Charter Oak, heavily mounted in gold, to the Hon. J. C. Breckinridge. Henry White, an old merchant of Phila delphia, and lor many years an intimate friend of Henry Clay, died last Sunday. John H. Harston, esq , has been appointed chief clerk in the office of the second comp troller of the treasury. It is understood that measures to relieve the treasury will early be taken by tho pro per committees in both branches of Congress. The South. The legislative secession of the State of South Carolina continues to progress slowly and without anything of special interest transpiring. The moment the State of South Carolina adopts the ordinance of secession, which re quires three days for formal consummation, the people in Charleston will refuse to recog nize any further responsibility of the State to the Federal Government-. At a matis meeting of the citizens of Ame ricus, Georgia, recently held, it was resolved that "if any means of satisfactory security : to our rights in the Union can he devised, j we greatly prefer it, if not., it is our duty to | go out." Speculations concerning the strength of the harbor forts form the talk of Charleston. Forts Moultrie and Pinckney are thought weak, but Fort Sumter is a place of great strength. The lower tier of guns ha? lately been mounted. The distress consequent, upon the troubled state of our national affairs is not confined to any one section of the Union as will ap pear from the following paragraph fj*oni the Atlanta (Ga ) Locomotive ot last week: ? "Xever before have there been as many la bores thrown our nf employment in Atlanta, as at this time. Most of the carpenters are idle, (the improvement.';being all discontinu ed) and many of them have iargs families I depending upon them for bread, and they I can get no work. Leave has been obtained to introduce in j the South Carolina Legislature, bills of high i est importance. One to establish the foreign diplomacy of South Carolina, oue to purchase steam propellers, and one to establish coast and harbor police. Iu the ilouse a resolu tion was introduced and referred declaring it inexpedient to till the vacancies caused by the resignation of Senators Chesnut and Hammoud. The North. The summary dissolution of the late John ! Brown meeting in Boston, is viewed with general satisfaction. The Abolitionists were largely outvoted throughout by uu assem blage embracing many leading business men. The Taunton Republican, a Lincoln paper, ! speaks out against the Massachusetts and i other Personal Liberty Bills. . Petitions are being circulated in Michigan : asking the forthcoming Legislature to repeal the Personal Liberty laws now on the statute book. The State of Iowa has never passed any law conflicting with the fugitive slave law.

VIRGINIA NEWS. John Gasking, tjharged with appropriating to himself letters for which he was sent to the Richmond Post Office, was acquitted in the United States Circuit Court yesterday. As soon as the verdict was announced, the poor boy (who, up to ihe period of the of fence with which he was charged, bure an i excellent character) burst into tears. The Judge addressed him in a few most feeling and | admonishing words, and while he was doing | so, the boy's mother, who is an industrious ? and respectable widow lady, who has had many trials in life, came into Court, and when the acquittal was announced to her she folded her child to her heart and gave way to ! emotions so deep and thrilling, as to bring the tear to the eyo of every man in court. On Tuesday, the Colonade Building, oppo site the Court House, in Fredericksburg, was burnt to the ground. The tire, says i tho Fredoricksburg JN'ews, supposed to be j tho work of an incendiary, originated in thu ' Restaurant in the Basement, which, with ! tho Offices of the Gas Co. and Gordonsville I Railroad, on the second floor, lost all their j contents?except the books of the Gas Co., ; which were saved in a damaged condition. !

Most, if not all, of tho j convicts spoken of have been-in tho employ ! ment of the Bibbs' for months past. The family of Gallatin Bibb, consisting of I himself, wife-and seven children, living in Amherst county, Ya., has been afflicted with a most distressing mortality in the lawt few weeks. Since the 4th of November, four of the children have died of dipthcria, l while tho other three children, together with the father and mother, are dangerously ill with the disease.

Stranoe Murder.?We find in the New Orieaus Bee an account of fhe trial for mur der of one Hermogene Perry, u native of Xew Orleans, twenty-eight years of age. Perry appears to have been a quiet and good intentioned youth originally, and was not overcome by that vice that brings about so many bloody deeds?the love of drink. The rock upon which be split morally appears to have been the loose rein lie gave to a too vivid imagination, which, qs it gained in morbid strength by the latitude given it, gra dually sapped all the latent energy of mind ho possessed, and dimmed the light of both reason and conscience. Revelling amid the gorgeou.sness of his ijimsy castle in the air, he acquired a distaste for honest lab jr. and fell into a slothful desire for sudden posses sion of wealth, that in time assumed near ly the proportions of a monomaniac delu sion. Unhappily for him, be drew a prize of S5,000 in the Havana lottery, which rapidly melted away through his owu carelessness ami improvidence, and from this time forth he appears to have been a slothful misan thrope, living iu the unhallowed atmosphere of his own morbid imagination. The- circumstances of the death of Droze are both singular io their nature and drama tic in their occurrence. According to all the evidence elicited, Droze lost his patience with a stick of wood ho was chopping in his own yard, and used an epithet that would have beeu opprobrious and aggravating if applied to a person. The poor old mother of Perry, not io the possession of complete sanity, heard the exclamation io her yard, nextdnor, and supposed it was intended for herself. She went into the house and told Droze at his dinner table that he had incited her, and that his life belonged to her son, nor could she be convinced of her error, iier son, in hia morbid ?nd misanthropical state of tnind was but too ready to avenge the insult he be lieved had been cast upon his parent, and at tacked Droze on the street. Droze defended himself with his cane, and Perry then stab bed him. Ab Droze ran into the grocery store for refuge, Perry's crazed mother came up and nerved her son to follow and despatch hi.m, while the terrified wife was approach-i ing to shield her husband. The grocery keep- j er, in mistake, prevented the escape of Droze j through the back door, and he fell beneath : stabs almost, in the arms of his wife, An Easy Remedy for our Wrongs. The philosophic spirit in which the New Orleans ]>ee discusses tlm wrongs and con siders the remedies of the South, is as worthy of imitation as its suggestions are of being attentively weighed. In a late number, it adverts to an easy and complete remedy, i which may be used while the South remains 1 in the Cniou, and which is perfectly coai patable with the faithful observance of her j constitutional obligations. There is no | earthly reason why the South should con | tinue to enrich her bitter and inveterate 1 foes; why her merchants should annually import mi]iions of dollars worth of North ern products; why Southern men should j regularly pass the summer months at New | York, Philadelphia, .Boston, Newport, Na ? hant, Saratoga, and other Northern cities, lavishing with characteristic liberality their hard earnings on those who, while waxing wealthy on the fruits "of Southern labor, hate us from the bottom of their hearts, and take counsel for ou?* ruin. Without very painful sacrifices; without sudden and startling changes, it is entirely within the power of the Southern States gradually to withdraw from the North, and to keep at home sums of almost fabulous value. By thus acting, we cease to foster our enemies; i we abstain from strengthening the hand raised to smite us; we decline swelling Northern coffers with Southern treasure, aud wc retain amongst ourselves those re sources which in a too generous spirit we have for years been squandering upon our prosecutors and revilcrs. This is a curative means which is far less rapid than a violent separation of the two sections, but which is ! fraught with no contention, can provoke no I complaint, is free from all danger of war and bloodshed, and will assuredly, in the i course of a few years, secure results of ex- j traordinary importance. A policy such as this must eventually de- j molish the boasted superiority of Northern j trade, while it creates and consolidates j Southern independence. It is evident that j in proportion as our eitizeus cease to be j dependent upon Northern industry for a j multitude of the necessities and comforts of i life, they will begin to look about them and i enquire whether the same articles cannot be ! procured at home. Every dollar withdrawn j from Northern commerce will bo invented j in Southern enterprise. When we give up ; purchasing boots and shoes and hats and j clothes, and machinery of all kinds, and glass and chitiaware, and ten thousand other products of Northern industry, we shall as suredly direct our attention to the expe diency of manufacturing them ourselves.? It needs but a beginning, and the great j laws of necessity and demand will accom plish the rest. The South has hitherto been exceedingly loth to realize the truth of a fundamental axiom in political economy, viz; that a ufttion can never grow rich which exports all it produces, and imports all it needs. In other words, people who would wish to build up material prosperity, and its concomitants, greatness and power, must be almost entirely self-dependent and self-supporting. This is no arduous pro blem in a land like the South, teeming with ali the elements of wealth?with cheap, continual aod controllable labor; with the raw material at hand, and henoe exempt from all expense of transportation; with every possible means and appliance for the successful prosecution of manufacturing in dustry -and best of all, with a lervid pa triotism and n,aniy spirit of dignity and in dependence perpetually inviting her s ins to cast off the trammeis of Northern mercan tile despotism. We still hope that in the midst of the very discords and commotions now prevail ing, the South will be enabled to discover a path leading to Mie attainment of all she deems dearest and most preciou?.?Rich. Whig. New Congressional Apportionment. The ccn.-us of 1860 haviug been complet ed, it now remains to make the new appor tionments of Congressional Districts accord ing to that census. On previous occasions this ha? been accomplished by a special act of Congress as soon as the oensus has been taken, but by an act of Congress passed May 23, 18G0, it is provided "that from ami after the 3d day of March, 1853, the House (if Representatives shall be composed of 23':? members," to bo appointed according to the following arrangement: As p.oon &u the returns of the census have 1 eon made to the office of the Department of the Interior, it shall b'1 tho duty of the .Secreta ry of that Department to ascertain the aggre gate representative population of the United States, which is effected by tho following mean*, viz: by adding to the whole number of free persons in the United States, "includ ing those bound to service for a number of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons," which ag gregate population the Secretary shall divide by the number 233, and the product of said division, rejecting any fraction of a unit, shall be the ratio of apportionment of Represen tatives among the various States. Tho Sec retary of the Interior shall then proceed in the same manner > ascertain tho represen tative population of each State l^y the ratio already determined by him as above shown; and the result of this last- division shall be the number of Representatives appointed to each State. The loss in the number ofmombers caused by the fractions remaining in the several States shall he compensated for by assigning to so many States having the largest frac tions an additional member each for the fraction, as may bo necessary to make the number of Representative 238. When it shall occur that a new State or States fhall be admitted into the Union the Representative or Representatives assigned to such State or Stales shall be in addition to the number of Representatives limited as above, which excess over the regulated num ber shall only continue until the time of taking the next census, when a new appor tionment will be made. The lists made out are to be transmitted to Congress and the Governors of the States.? Wushiiif/ioii Status.

I Public Meeting in Albemarle. Correspondence of the Alexandria Gazette. There was a very large meetingof the peo ple uf this county, in the Court House here, yesterday, and I have procured for you from ia friend a copy ot' the resolutions adopted. Robert Hill Carter, e?q., presided and Mr. Peyton, of "theReview," and Mr. Alexander, ! of "the Jeffersonian," were the Secretaries. Able aud eloquent speeches were made by ! Alexander Rives, V. W. Sout.hall, T. Jeffer ' son Randolph, Eghnrt R. Watson, N. II. ! Massis; Franklin Minor and others, and the j following Resolutions passed unanimously. Whereas, a crisis has arisen in our national af I fairs, so momentous in its consequences, that it is i the duty of all men who prize the institutions au i der which wo live, tu take thoir position openly ' and decidedly on the great issues before us, ! therefore. we, the people of Albemarle, without" i distinction of party, do solemnly declare and rc j solve? 1st. That waiving all discussion as to whether i the right of secession is a constitutional or a rcvo i lutionary right, yet should any one or more of the ; States determine, under existing circumstances, ! to withdraw fruni the Union, we are sternly and j unalterably opposed to any attempt on thopart of ! the .Federal Government at coercion to prc | vent it. 2nd. That the very corner stone of our Federal ! Union under the Constitution, is the perfect aud j absolute equality of all the States in Conatitution j al rights, and that much as we have been or may I still bo attached to tbut Union, we are yet prcpar J ed to sever it in twain, if this equality is not al ! lowed Us. ; ttrd. That wo are heartily tired of the never en i ding discussion of the slavery question by those who have neither iuterest in it, nor control over it, and it i* our solemn conviction that, the time has now come when this question mujt bo settled, or a dissolution of the Union is inevitable. 4th. That in our opinion, a Convention elected by the people of Virginia, ought to be called in such mannor, and to meet at such time, as will nuike its action most efficient and imposing, to de termine the future course an'd position of the State, and if possible to inaugurate some scheme | for the final adjustment of the slavery agitation. 5th. That identified as we are, and ever have been, in interest, in sympathy, and in feeling with tho slavebolding States of this Con'oderacy, wo feci thai we can most emphatically declare that an overwhelming majority of their people are sternly and uncompromisingly opposed to the re opening of fcbo African slave trade. Oth. That we do earnestly deprccato any attempt to bring the people of either section of the Union t<? a decision of the questions between them, with out careful and full deliberation. 7th. That having so many interests and sympa thies in common, all the slavcholding States of the Union ought to aut together in the settlement of this whole question, and fur this purpose we earnestly recommend conference amongst them, through their respective Legislatures or Conven tions, and deprecate any hasty action in advance of such Conference, as greatly calculated to divide and distract us. Sth, That we are not yet willing to give up the hope aud belief that a national Convention truly representing the people of the States, North and South can agree upon some permanent C&nititu tionul adjustment of the questions in issue be tween them, and we, therefore, favor the call, at an early day, of such a Convention. After the adoption of the resolutions, Wm. F. Gordun, esq., (Douglas IVm.) proposed that tiie people of Albemarle should express to their bfetBren throughout the State their deliberate conviction that in the present perilous condition of the country, the party differences which have heretofore divided them ought to cease and ba forgotten and that the meeting should proceed to nominate a candidate whose opinions tire in harmony with the foregoing resolutions, to represent Albemarle in the House of Delegates of Vir ginia to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Mr. Garth. Accordingly, on motion of N. II. Massie, esq., (Rreck. Dem.) the nomination was unanimously conferred on Thomas Wood, esq . a very respectable member of the bar, and Mayor of Charlottesville. He has acted heretofore with the "Whig party, but declares himself now "a. no parti/ man except to defend and preserve the rights of the South, which lie pledged him self to aid in (bring, peaceably if ho could, forcibly if he must." I have rarely attended a meeting which in my judgment- reflected more honor upon it? members than this patriotic assemblage of the people of Albemarle. By ignoring old party lines and acting like men having a common interest and a common fate and passing with entire unani mity these admirable resolutions, they have set an example worthy of all imitation by the other oounties of the Commonwealth.

ATED. '?"Ciiil ujHin mo iu the day of trouble, and I will deliver you.'' Is it not rather surprising that in the midst of the present dangers which threaten the peace and prosperity of our beloved land, so little is said concerning the subject of prayer f Who can look upon the dark and lowering cloud which at present over shadows our political horizon, and with any degree of certainty predict the direful con sequences of that storm which"seems about bursting upon us?

None but the God of nations can snatch us from the impending ruin, lie may have allowed the present crisis to come upon us in order to call forth univorsal prayer and supplication. As other .Spates have set apart days for prayer and supplication, would it not be well for us as lovers of our country and our country's God to follow their example, by setting apart a day for deep humiliation and prayer before God. "Who knoweth but the Lord will yet be entreated, will calm the madness of thn people, will quench the flames of contention, and breathe into all the spirit of love, unity, and concord. Then brother shall not life up sword against brother, neither shall they koow war any more. Then shall plenty and peace flourish in our land, and ali the inhabitants of it be thankful," and rightly appreciate the in numerable blessings which they enjoy. Alexandria Co., Ya., Dec. 2, 18GU. II. [Com m unic ated. Incendiarism in King Ge"Kqe County, Va.?About three o'clock on Sunday morn ing, the 2d inst., the barn of Mr. S. 0. S. Brown, was discovered iu be on lire, and the wind being high at the time, the building with its contents, consisting of a large quan tity of fodder, farming implements, gear, &c., together with a valuable horse belonging to a visitor of the family, was in a few minutes a heap of ruins. The corn houses, with sev eral hundred barrels of corn, nest took fir?, aud were also eutirely consumed?" The dwel ling house, was for a considerable time in great danger, and it is ahuost ir miracle it did not shtjrc the fate of the other buildings. The loss is estimated at from twelve to four teen hundred dollars, for which there ia a partial insurance. A negru of notoriously ii:id character, who, had the night previous, been punished by a son of Mr. Brown's, who was one of a patrol, appointed by the Court, U generally believed to be the incendiary, p.nd has been arrested and committed to jail, A good deal of excitement prevails i$ the community, at such a fiendish outrage. King George oounty, Dec. S,? Meeting at Mouatsville, Loudoun County. According to appointment, the adjourned meeting to be held at Mountsville, on Satur day the 1st day of December, met and or ganized by appointing Dr. John E. Mount co theChair, and Henson Simpson, Secretary. On motion of Col. John R.- Carter, Mr. John A. English, was substituted in the place of Mr. Sidney llawl.ing, one of the ab sent committee-men, appointed at the former meeting. On motion of James R. Simpson, esq., the Committee of five on Resolutions, consisting of John A. English, Capt. John II. Simpson, B. F. Carter, J. R. Simpson, esq.,, and Col. John R. Carter, retired, and after a few minutes returned and reported through their Chairman, John A. English, the following resolutions : 1st. Resolved, That the government of the Uni l ted States is a compact between seperate, inde pendent and sovereign States, its powers speci fied and limited to the accomplishment of the ob ject specified in the preamble to the Federal Con stitution. 2d. Resolved, That tho power thus conferred boing derived from the States thereof, as separate and independent communities "in their highest sovereign capacity/' may be resumed by them "whenever the same shall be perverted to thoirin jurv or oppression." 3d. Resolved, That tho States, constituting said compact, being originally tho equals of each other, tho citizens of each are equally entitled to its ben efits and protection to their persons and property wherever its jurisdiction extends, and that, thero fjrc, every citizen of the slave-holding States is entitled to such protection in his property of what ever kind in all the Territories as long an they re main such. 4th. Resolved, That we regard each and all of the stipulations in the aforesaid compact as equal ly binding upon all the States aud citizens there of, and that we regard the action of the Legisla tures of most of the Northern States of the Union, in defeating the constitutional provision and law of Congress for tho rendition of Fugitive Slaves, as palpable violations, on their part, of the terms of the compact, and such as absolve the Southern States from the duty of observing its obligations, and entitling each and all of them, if it be their will, lo withdraw. 5th. Resolved, That the late Presidential eloc tiou having been decided upon these and their kindred piinciples, such as the "irrepressible con flict" doctrines for the extinction of slavery, of which Abraham Lincoln was tho author; we caD but regard his election by a majority so over whelming in that section which has the numerical strength to give it control of the government and which is so hostile to the favorite institutions of the southern section of tho confederacy as an ex pression of their purpose to carry into effect a po licy, which will deprive the citizens of fifteen States of this Union of their just and equal rights," and reduce them to a state of dependence, exposed to loss and danger of servile insurrection and ine quality as free American citizens. 6th. Resolved, That the election of Abraham Lincoln upon the principles of the platform adopt ed by the Republican party, in convention, assem bled at Chicago, Illinois, together with his ante cedents, or the unqualified endorsement of such men as Sumner, Greeley, Giddings and Seward, are sufficient causes for the immediate considera tion by all the Southern States of secession. 7th. Resolved, That it is the deliberate convic tion of tliis meeting that Virginia eanHOt consis tently, with honor or safety to herself, remain in the Union should the powers of the Federal Gov ernment be administered, as we believe they will, upon tho principles of the Republican party, and that it is hor imperative duty to withdraw. 8th. Resolved, That for the foregoing reasons we recommend to our Legislature, which will soon assemble, to take the necessary action to secure a convention of the fifteon slave-holding States, to take such steps an the exigencies of the time3 and a proper regard for our rights in property and j person require, and as a freo and independent peo- ' pie shall think necessary and proper. On motion of Charles E. Mount, the fore going resolutions were put to the vote of tho meeting and adopted, and on the further mo tion of John A. English their adoption was declared unanimous, On motion of Col John A. Carter, it was resolved, by the meeting, that the proceed ings of the meeting be published by the Democratic Mirror, with the request that the "Washingtonian, the Virginia Sentinel, Al exandria Gazette, and the Richmond pa pers publish, the aame. On motion of Dr. John E. Mount, a vote of thanks was tendered to John A. English for his very elaborate, eloquent and patriotic ad dress upon the right of secession by the Southern States. J011N E.
