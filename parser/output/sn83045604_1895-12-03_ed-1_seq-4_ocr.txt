The ticket nominated by the three com mittee* is very fairly representative, and although there are some men named who have not been particularly Identified with municipal affairs, they are in the main men of excellent character and above the average In Intelligence. But the strong cat point In their favor Is that they have been regularly nominated through the means agreed upon by the three political bodies, and are entitled to public support. There was a sort of understanding on the part of all citizens that the ticket should be non-partisan, and It would neither be fair to the nominees nor In the public Inter est to make a contest. Objections have bein made to some of th© candidates, and a newspaper is the usual means by which such objections would be urned, but the obje -lions com© too Isti'. Nu :i k>-t i-<iuld be tlev:«rd aK.ii it which some objections would not be urged, and the one agree 1 upon by the committees is probably as lutlo open to criticism as any combination of fifteen men represent ing all parties and all s< ;ions of the city that could 1m devtHtfd. ONE THING TO J>o - present congress hns a very Import ant task before It. Whether or not It will be equal to that task remains to be seen. Jn the president's message, which will )>© read today, the past year's stewardship will b© shown In greater or less detail, and no doubt many recommendations will b© made, ostensibly with a view of showing how we may be fixed from the difficult lea and emlmrrassnicnts in which this coifn try has been plunged for a year or more. Whether th« -«» recommendations v\ ill have tnerlt in them, of course cannot be deter mined tmnl they are * vn In full, but It Is not very probable they- v. dl commend themselves t » persons mho tr> e th© course of present troubles to sources far different from those to which the presi dent « lil attribute all cur pe.st and pr» sent woes. First of all. It Is not at all likely that VJr, Cleveland aill toueh upon th© general Incompetency of the Ivm.vcratlc party as a creative and administrative organisa tion. Even if he knows It. ! nouM hard ly b© warranted In mentioning It. as th »t party's bead. Moreover. It ts not at all probable he will reason that any uf the Ills of the recent past a:e In any m asure due to an abortive «tt> :npt to reform the tariff. t.)n ths contrary, it is to »•© ex l>ected he will approve our Ism tariff legis lation. and. If he does not advise an Imme diate assault upon our duties again, be will, no doubt, lntlmats that stub an at tack should bs contemplate d .«o soon i:s the con . tion of o - rev. < war-ants It. In view of thts position, wlxn h th# presi dent will very probably take. It Is not Im probable that those who d'.ba*;re© with him as to ths cause of our troubles will refuse to bs governed by his a I vice, as b©- lng that of a man who doesn't fret at ths root of the disease, a.-.l is theiefor© r. t qualified to prescribe efficient rem*-Pes. It is gensrally expected that a * ingestion will be ma Is to th© effect t ! %t the retire ment of the greenbacks will eork o r financial salvation, but thts Is a mere Inci dent to the rehabilitation of the nation »i treasury. Ths government must ha%e mors revenue, and that is what ths new eongres* must prev ; 0 for it. whether th# president reallE>s the fact or not. In the beg*nn -we ths treasury officials Insisted that the deficit was er.'y tempo rary. Like most pre dictions fre-m the same source, this proved to le srroneo s. it has become a chronic trouble, an 1 tr«?ead of decreasing (vromlses to lr.ere»*«. \\ ;n the government n.arc: # b- h 1 at least a month, a plain duty of congress that cannot be avoided's to so Increase our In ome as to make It meet our current ex senses w thout borrom Jr.g.

His tneories have al ready brought enough d.stress upon the country and there Is no reason why the people's representatives should acquiesce In putting them Ir.to practice longer. 

WHOM DOE* UK HOODWINK T Judge Orange Jacobs has on more than one occasion expressed himself on the wa ter question, and his v ews are embodied In ths fallowing extract from a communi cation over his own signature: "The question of Increase of municipal Indebtedness or the Issue of bonds is not submitted nor Is it to be dec.ded. First, because that requires three-fifths of the legal voters troting at the election to be in its favor; this is only a majority.- Sec ondly. because the 6 per cent, limit bas been passed, and such being the fact, statutory and constitutional law al.ka forbid ir and the courts will enforce their prohibitory mandates. Will some of those logicians teli me how the approval of the pian embodied In the ballot, and specified In section 2 of the ord.nance, will create an Indebtednqpa? Tho voter !s not called upon to express by hie ballot h'.s opinion of the menas proposed or hereafter to be devised, witi.ln constitut.onal mode* and prohibitions. Not at a'.l. He simply rat ifies or rejects the plan proposed, and that too by a majority vote." The question of further Indebtedness can not be submitted because the constitutional limit is paused. Therefore, we can issue constltutlon dudg.ng warrants; but that 3oes not make the debt any less a debt. It will have to be paid. It Is one thing to dodge the con stitution and another to dodge a creditor. The statute of limitations prevents col lection of a debt after a certain time, but the man who takes advantage of it is usu ally considered to be a rogue, neverthe less, if that be his only defense. The constitution wisely provided that no debt over IVi per cent, of the property val uation should be Incurred except by con sent of three-tifths of the voters, but this de.jt. it seems, is lawful without any other vote than the city council. Judge Jacobs says that the limit having been passed, "statutory and constitutional law alike forbid It, and the courts will en force their prohibitory mandates." But what on earth is the use of constitutional and statutory law and prohibitory man dates, if, as he says later, "we have a de cision of the supreme court of thla state declaring tnat the means provided by the city council do not create a city indebted- Will som* of the logicians summoned by Judge Jacob* tell us what the constitution and the court* are going to do about It, If the city council may creato a del»t which U not a city indebtedness? Are we to pay it, or repudiate it? Wo confess that we huva no use for the man or the municipality who or which de liberately borrows money or Incurs obliga tions with an idea of making believe that it is not a debt, lie moans either to fool hi* creditor or ha is trying to fool him self. The Boston Traveler says that our army and navy officers are thorough aristocrats; that Annapols or West Point men believe they are made of superior clay, and on ev ery occasion they let the mere civilian know his place. This prejudice they carry Into family life, and their wives and daugh ters Imbibe it fium them. A great many will d.:-put« this. It Is perhaps true that, became of environment and peculiar sur roundings. army and navy people become clannish a::d greatly attached to the life of the service, and If some of them act as aristocrats or people made of superior clay- It is V a use civilian worship prompts them to do it. The cattle show which followed the horse show In New York, was quite a success. It was really an exhibition of dairy stock, and such prominent butter.nakers were present as Gov. Morton. John D. Rocke feller, Theodore Ila vemeyer, CUauncey M. Depew, Robert Bonner, J. Otto Donne r, J, rirrpont Morgan. Cornelius Yanderbilt. H. K. BloodK°od. K. It Ladew. Charles M. Chapln and Joseph K. Widener.

The trouble with Senator Hill was. he didn't strike when the iron was hot. Had he started out on a lecture tour a year ago he would probably have b*en greeted with crowded houses. As it is now. h.s star Is on the wane It fs sfmifl' ant that the most of the Democratic newspapers put In their time making jwedictions as to who the Repub lican nominee next year will be, and do vote very little space to discussing their own candidates.

Either these Improvements are not needed or else the man who said r.ira>l«e was a fair s rt of a place, but nnt quite up to Boston must have been Josh ing St. Peter. The collection of the income tax was a little worse than a failure. It cost JWI.OOO to collect fTT.W in taxes, and as the >77.000 was refunded. It doeen't show up as a very profitable pie -e of business. When the last congress was Jugwling with a 400-amendment tariff bill the Demo cratic papers styled It reforming the tariff. Now suggestions of change in the law are construed to be tinkering. Senator Sherman replies to the critics of his Recollections by eaylng that he has "nothing to add." That is not the ques tion. They wish to know if he has any thing to subtract. They have formed a Ufa-saving class In the S-attle Athletic Club, and It will prob ably do rather more practical good than learning to be an adept In the manly art of self-defence. England refuses to submit the Venezue lan dispute to arbitration, and Brazil re fuses to submit the Trinidad matter to ar bitration, thus g.ving John Bull a little of hU own medicine. ' Eafe Pence says there is no money In pol itics, and therefore he got out of It. He was supposed to belong to a party, the members of which were not in it for money. The believers of Schlatter, the heal»r, claim that he can cure anything, but that only shows the healer has never tried to relieve a man who has a bee in his bonnet. Statisticians have figured up that the cost of hauling farm products to market is two-thirds of which might be saved with good roads. The effect of tariff reform was shown in a very marked way when the clerks yesterday counted up the number of votes for Crisp for speaker.

No Probability o. lay Opposition to th<* Ticket. There is no doubt that some efforts were mais to have a second u. ket cf freehold ers to revise fhe charter, but : seems as If that attempt was made before and not since the combination. A pei.«-on was drafted at a time when t ere seemed to some doubt as to whether there could be an agreement between the central com mittees. One of the promoters of t-he pro posed opposition, t. ket sa:J yesterday that the present talk evidently arose out of the original plan, ar.d that if any »>etit:on was circulating now it was oiie of the old one*, because the Idea was abandoned when the combination v.*as agreed upon. The i:st of names published on Sunday was gathered from persons who believed they could accurately remember the list, but it seems evident that the names were those of men who had been talked of prior to the joint meeting.
