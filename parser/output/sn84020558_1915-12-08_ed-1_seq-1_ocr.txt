CHICAGO LIKELY FOR REPUBLICANS Politieal Leaders in Wash ington Regard It as Prac ticallv Certain Chicago Will 'Be Selected as Re publican Convention City Republican A. P. Leased WireJ "WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. The demo cratic national convention of 1916 will a hid of $100,000. St. Louis placed Wednesday, June 14, at noon. The democratic national 'committee tonight named the convention city and adopt ed resolutions calling for the nomi nation and re-election of Woodr,ow Wilson as "the trusted leader of na tional democracy." Chicago and Dallas contested with St. Louis for the honor'of the con vention, but St. Louis easily led from the start and won on the second bal lot. When the trend of the voting was seen, Texas moved that the choice of St. Louis be made unanimous. Dal las held second place on the first ballot, but was displaced by Chicago on the second roll call. The result of the first ballot was: St. Louis, 25; Dallas, 14; Chicago, 13. On the second ballot the vote was: St. Louis, 2S; Chicago, 13; Dallas, 9. The majority for St. Louis was gained on this ballot when John T. JleGraw arose near the end of the call and changed West Virginia's vote from Chicago to the Missouri city. Then the choice was made unanimous. It has been customary heretofore for national conventions to begin work on Tuesday. The fact that Tuesday fell on the thirteenth next year may .or may not. have had something to do with the determination of the conven tion to begin the proceedings a day later. The official explanation, how ever, was to the effect that the con vention would not require more than three or four days to complete its work, and it would not be too late in the week to start on Wednesday. ' Political leaders in Washington to night regarded it as practically cer tain that Chicago would be selected for the republican convention when the national convention of that party meets next Tuesday. The date for this convention probably will be late in June. Kach of the three cities contesting for the democratic convention put in a bid of $100,000. St. Louis placed In the hands of the chairman New York drafts for that amount. Dallas offered a certified check, while Chi cago presented a pladge. from the Association of Commerce to contrib ute $100,000 on call of the treasurer of the democratic committee. The advocates of St. Louis supple mented their financial inducements by a warning to the committee that the convention was needed in Missouri to keep the eighteen electoral votes of that state in the democratic column. The delegation from Dallas pleaded with the committee to reward the loyal democracy of the south by send ing the convention next year to a southern state. The Texas speakers were greeted with enthusiastic" cheers by the members of their delegation and the "rebel yell' several times in terrupted the proceedings. Chicago based its appeal largely on its climate and Hs known ability to take care of crowds. The national committee was in session almost con tinuously from 11:30 a. m. until late tonight, completing details mf conven tion arrangements, discussing finan cial ways and means for the coming campaign and debating various sub jects of party interest. The opening of the session was given the atmosphere of a lovefeast when Thomas J.

P. Leased Wire LONDON, Dec. 7. Referring to the criticism on the inadequacy of the force detailed to advance on Bagdad, the Marquis of Crewe, lord president of the council, said in the house of lords this afternoon that this was due to a misapprehension. The force at the disposal of General Townshend, lie said, was considerably larger than a division and was believed by compe tent authorities to e sufficient for the task assigned to it. It was also a misapprehension to say that this was a rash military ad venture, continued Lord Crewe, as it was clear to everybody that the early capture of Eagdad, if it could be ef 

SPEEDING MOTOR OAR CRUSHES OUT LIVES OF AN AGED COUPLE Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Slayton Struck l)v Car Driven by S. C. Sine of Gleudale Walk to School Partv Was Their Last. One of the most frightful accidents chronicled in the list of local automo bile fatalities occurred at eight o'clock yesterday evening at Alhambra when F. A. Slayton and his wife, elderly res idents of that neighborhood, had their lives crushed out under the wheels of a swiftly moving automobile driven by S. C. Sine, of Clendale. The affair was one of those regrettable accidents for which apparently nobody can be accused of having been at fault. Mr. and Mrs. Slayton, aged 63 and 5S respectively, were on their way to the Alhambra school house to attend an entertainment. They were walking down the road, and had reached a po sition almost in front of the school house. A woman, whose name was not learned, was driving a horse and bug gy in the direction of Phoenix, and was using the left side of the road, which according to custom, is the wrong side. The automobile driven by Mr. Sine was coming along toward Phoenix a short distance behind the buggy, and the driver did not see the old folks who were just a short dis tance ahead of the buggy. Seeing that he could not run around the buggy on the right side. Mr. Sine speeded up his car and attempted to pass the ve hicle on the left side. The old folks evidently Oi l not know of the proxim ity of the car. In order to give the buggy a clear path, they hastily step ped back into the road and directly in the path of the automobile. The driver states that he did not see the couple until lie was practically on them, and of course too late to stop the car, to avoid striking them. The victims were struck squarely by the front of the machine and both were knocked under the wheels. The driver stopped his ear after it had gone a short distance, and returned to the prostrate forms that lay huddled on the dark roadway. In the car with l.im as passengers were Isaac Farney of 911 West Fillmore street. Phoenix, and Mrs. Winchester, also of this city. Following a hasty examination by the passengers, it was found that Mr. TURKS OPERATE .Republican A. P. Leased Wire) BERLIN', (By wireless to Tuckerton, N. J.) Dec. 7. Advices received htVe from the front in Mesopotamia are to the effect that the Turks are contin uing to operate vigorously against the British expedition along the Tigris river. They have driven the troops routed from the region of Bagdad within entrenchments at Kut-El-Amara and also expelled them from the north bank of the Tigris at this point. The Turks, it is asserted, continue to capture the transport wagons at- tached to the expedition, a large por tion of which were unable to reach : the advanced base at Kut-El-Araara. Much ammunition was captured just above Kut-El-Amara. The losses in j transports, it is said, not only will pre- i vent a renewal of the British advance j against Bagdad, but will endanger I the further retreat of the expedition in case it should be driven from Kut-El-Amara. LANSING TELLS GERMANY WHY ATTACHES WERE UNDESIRABLE Republican A. P. Leased Wire WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Secretary Lansing has communicated to Ger many through Count von Bernstorff, the German ambassador, the reasons which caused the United States fected, would have great results on the war, not only military results. Baron Sydenham thought the one bright spot in "this very dark pic ture" was the manner in which Gen eral Townsiiend's forces fought at Ctesiohon. The stand against greatly superior forces and the capture of 1.600 prisoners, he declared, was a very fine feat. Baron Sydenham emphasized that the force consisted largely of Indian troops and eulogize General Town shend, who was wise in retiring when he found overwhelming forces against him and saved his own men from a very great disaster. Slayton was dying and that his wife, though still conscious, was in a fearful shape as the result of the blow struck her by the car. A number of persons were hastily called from the school house and the slaytons were made as comfortable as possible on cushions and robes from the machine. Dr. Hill of Alhambra was called, and a mes sage sent to this city for an ambu lance. In the meantime the slender thread of lite left in the injured man snapped, and the first fatality of the evening was recorded. Mrs. Slayton was suffering severe pains in her back, and requested those nearby to place some of the cushions under her that she might rest more comfortably. It was not thought at first that she bad been fatally injured, and when the ambulance arrived, she was placed tenderly in the convey ance, and the trip to Phoenix was be gun. However, before the ambulance had gone very far, Mrs. Slayton sud denly gave a gasp, anu fell back lire less. The remains of both the man and his wife were taken to the undertak ing parlors of Moore & McClellan on Adams stre-.-t. Coroner DeSouza will conduct an inquest this morning. A hasty examination of the bodies scemoel to show that the man's death had been caused by injuries sustained about the head, while Mrs. Slav-ton's back seemed to he broken. Hoth had been badly cut and lacerated from the effects of the blow. The unfortunate man and woman resided on a ranch near Alhambra and are survived by two sons, Ray mond, aged is. who lived at home, and Roy, who is at present in Massachu setts. The latter was apprised of the death of his parents. Mr. anil Mrs. Slayton had been res idents of the neighborhood of Alham bra for a number of years and were in well-to-do circumstances. Thev were prominent workers in the Meth odist Episcopal church and vere quite well known throughout the vicinity of their home. Mr. Sine is the owner of a hard ware store in Olendaie. which he runs in partnership with his brother, and is also the owner of a ranch ne;:r that place. He accompanied the re mains of Mr. and Mrs. Slayton to town, anrl went to the office of Sher iff Adams, where, following the re cital of the details of the case, he was absolved of carelessness in connection with the distressing tragedy.

In the communication, which is be lieved to have reached the Berlin foreign office today, Mr. Lansing is understood to have stated that the naval and military activities of the attaches constituted their principal offenses. It is said that there was no discussion of facts relating to the reasons for the state department's re quest, ,nor any disclosure of the de partment's sources of information. Whether Germany expected a dis cussion of the facts has not been made known. Officials are awaiting with interest to see whether the .Mer lin foreign office will be satisfied with the stating of the broad, general reasons. The opinion seemed to pre vail that Germany might, with the reasons before it, instruct the am bassador to send the attaches away without further delay. In some quar ters, however, it was thought another communication might come from Berlin. Secretary Lansing declined to com ment upon the subject for publication today and the German embassy also was reticent. -

PRESIDENT WILSON READS HIS MESSAGE TO CROWDED HOUSE Touches Upon Varietv of Subjects, Predominating Note Peing on Policy of Military Preparedness of the Nation. Republican A. P. Leased Wire WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. President Wilson, in his annual address to con gress today, dealing mainly with the national defense, proclaimed an ad vanced Pa n - Americanism growing from the guardianship of the Mon roe doctrine to the ''full and hon orable association" of all the Am ericas. Although in the longest adddress he has as yet delivered to congress, the President touched upon a variety of subjects, the predominating note was the necessity of a policy of mili tary preparedness to meet the re adjustments of the next general con vention as they will affect the Am erican continent. He emphasized liis point by saying: "Unless you take it within your view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought, I caniut find the right light in which lo set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my whole thought as I address you here today. I mean litional defense." The point was not overshadowed when the President, in the most un measured terms he ever has em ployed . before congress. denounced naturalized Americans who, by their sympathies for the European bellig erents have endangered American neutrality. While congress cheered him loudly he referred to them as having "poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life," and as those who would in malign reaction against the govern ment and the people who had wel comed and nurtured them." With evidence of deeo feeling the Presi dent expressed "the ever, greater hu miliation and scorn which every self possessed and thoughtful patriotic- American must feel when he thinks of them and of the discredit they are daily bringing upon us." The President's condemnation of thos iie assailed so unreservedly wa r'ct by an emphatic demonstration of approval by Republicans and Dem ocrats alike. The bouse galleries were packed three hours before tile time the President was to deliver lifs address and hundreds who filled to get ad mission cards lined the corridors anrl plaza. Extra guards were the result of an elusive rumor that some sort of a suffrage demonstration would be made. Mrs. Gait, the President's fiance, and party occupied the executive gallery.

WILSON'S MESSAGE Republican A. P. Leased Wire WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. A doc trine of Pan-Americanism of fu'd partnership between the nations of the Western Hemisphere in world af lairs was proclaimed by President Wilson today in his third annual ad dress to Congress, the theme of which was preparedness by the United States to defend not only its own independence but the rights of those with whom it has made com mon cause. The message was rea l I by the president to the senate and. house assembled in joint session in I the chamber of the; house. !

The committee took no action, but the members appeared to enjoy the; debate thoroughly and applauded each speaker liberally. The hearing was arranged because the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, in convention here this week, wanted to tell the committee that suf frage had become a national issue.
