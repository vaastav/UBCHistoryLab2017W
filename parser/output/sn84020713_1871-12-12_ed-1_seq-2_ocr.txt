President's Message. Congress re-assembled on Monday, Dec. 4th, and President Grant delivered tlie fol lowing Message : To the Senate and II mm of lli-presentaticesr. In addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the Govern ment it is gratifying to be able to state that during the past year success has gen erally attended the ell'iit to execute all laws found upon the statute books. The policy has been, not to inquire into the wisdom of the laws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and intent, and to enlorce them ac cordingly. The past year has, under a wise Provi dence, been one of general prosperity ' to the nation. It has, however, been attended with more than usual chastisements in the loss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the Lest elements of human nature in our country, and to develope a friendship for lis on the part of foreign nations, which goes far toward alleviating thy distresses occassional by these calamities. The be nevolent who have so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes will reap their reward in the consciousness of having performed a noble act, and in re ceiving the grateful thanks of men, women, and children wlios; sufferings they have relieved. The relations of the United .States with foreign Powers continue to be friendly. The year has oven an eventful one in wit nessing two great nations, speaking one Janguage, and Having one lineage, settling )y peaceful arbitration disputes of long standing, and liable at any time to bring those-nations into bloody and costly con flict. An example has thus been set which, if successful in us issue, may be followed ly other civilized nations, and finally be 4the means of returning to productive indus try millions of men now maintained to set tle the disputes of nations by the bayonet and the broadside. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to which has been concluded since t .adjournment of Congress with her jUritanmc Majesty, and a copy of the proto cols or the conferences of th-j Commission ers by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the ques tions pending between ' the two nations. Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. 1 recommend Congress at an early day to make the necessary provision for the tribunal at Geneva, and for the sev eral commissions on the j art of the L'n'.led jSta,tes, called for by the treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the Presi dent of the fcwiss Confederation, and his Majesty the Emperor of lirazil, have each consented, on the joint request of the two Powers, to name an arbitrator for the tri bunal at Gene vi. I have caused my thanks lo be suitably expressed for the readiness with which toe joint request has been com plied with, by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions. llis Majesty the Emperor of Germany iias been pleased to comply with tin; joint request of the two Governments, and has consented to art as the arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the X' nited States and Great Britain. The con tracting parties in the treaty have under taken to regard as between themselves cer tain principles of public law, for which the 1J nited Mates have contended from the commencement of this history. They have jdso agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of the oilier maritime Powers, and to invite tliem to acceed to them. Ne gotiations are ironic; on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to be ex pended to the other Powers. I recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States lo bring into operation the articles of the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to the other matters pouching the relations of the United States towards the British North American posses sions, to become, operative so soon !is the proper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britian and its possessions. ' It is much to be desired that this legislation mav become operative before the lishermen of the United States bein to make their ar raugements for the coming season. 1 have addressed a eoniumiucation to the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, an 1 Wis consin, urging upon the governments of those States, respectively, tl:e necessary a r turn on their part lo carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty which con templates the use of the canals on either fide, connecting with the navigations of the ; Lakes and rivers forming the boutidarv, on j terms of equality by the inhabitants of both ! countries, it is hoped that the importance of the object and the benefits to flow there- j from will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanction of the States concerned. 1 renew the recommendation for an appro-j priation for determining the true position of; the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, where it j form, the boundary between the United j States and British North American posses- j fions between the lake of the Woods ami j the summit of the liocky Mountains. The early action of Congress on this recommen dation would put in the power of the War Department to place a force in the field dur ing the next summer. The resumption of the diplomatic rela tions between France and Germany has en abled me to give directions for the with drawal of the protection exte.ided to Ger mans in Franco by the diplomatic and con sular representatives of the United States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate duty " of this projection has been performed by the Minister and Council General at Paris, and the various consuls in France under the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well as with pru dence and tact. Their course has received the commendation of the German Govern ment, and has wounded no susceptibility of the French. The Government of tlw Emperor of Ger many continues to manifest a 'friendly feel ing towards the United States, and a de sire to harmonize with the moderate and j iSt policy which this Government main tains in its r 1 tiious with Asiatic Powers, as well as with the South American Kepublics. have given assurances that the friend I j' feelings of that Government are fully shared bv the United States. Kc J have been officially informed of the annex ation p.f the State of the Church to the JCimrdom of Italy, and the removal of the capital of the Kingdom to Rome. In con formity with the established policy of the United States, I have recognized this change. The ratifications of the new treaty of com merce between the United States and Italy have been exchanged. The two Powers have agreed in this treaty that private pro perty at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two Powers. The United States have. spared no oppor tunity of incorporating this rule into the obligation of nations. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a confer ence at Washington between the Plenipo tentiaries of Spain and the allied South American Republics, which has resulted in an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace. The intimate friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his Government to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospitable recep tion which has been jriven to the Grand Duke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that Government. The inex cusable course of the -Russian Minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, and to decline longer to receive that functionary as a diplomatic representa tive. It was impossible, with self-respect, or with a just regard to the dignity of the country, to permit Mr. Cataeazy to con tinue to hold intercourse with this Govern ment after his personal abuse of Govern ment officials, ami during his persistent in terference, through various means, with the relations between the United States and other Powers. In accordance with my wish es this Government has been relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Cataeazy, and the management of the affairs of the Impe rial Legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman entirely unobjectionable. With Japan we continue to maintain inti mate relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado has, since the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in oilices of importance in several departments of government. I have reason to think that this selectiou is due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy which the United States have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Jaj a '. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this Government to swerve from its established course. Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked sailors on the Corean coast, 1 instructed our Minister at Peking to endeavor to conclude a convention with Corea for securing the safety ami humane treatment of such mari ners. Admiral Rodgers was instructed to accompany him with sufficient force to pro tect him in case of need. A small survey ing party sent out, on reaching the coast, was treacherously attacked at a disadvan tage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apology for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed. After an arduous march over a rugged and diflicult country the forts from which the outrages hail been committed were reduced by a gallant assault, and were destroyed, llaviug thus punished the criminals, and having vindicated the honor of the Hag, the expedition returned, finding it impract icable, under the circumstances, to conclude the desired convention. I respectfully refer to the correspondence relating thereto here with submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see tit to take. The Republic of Mexico has not yet re pealed the very objectionable laws estab lishing what is known as the "Free Zone" on the frontier of the United States. It is hoped that this may yet be done, and also that more stringent measures may be taken by that Republic for restraining lawless persons on its frontiers. I hope that Mexico by its own action willSrjron relieve this Gov ernment of the difficulties experienced from these causes. Our relations with the various republics of Central and South America continue, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire, of lirazil lias taken the initia tory step toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with that Empire, always cor dial, will naturally be made more so by this act. It is not too much to hope that the Government of Brazil may hereafter find it tor its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates. 1 desire to direct your attention to the fact that citizens oftne United States, or persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, are large holders in foreign lands of this species ol property forbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged country. 1 recommend to Congress to provide, by stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against the holding, owning, or dealing in slaves, or being interested m slave property in foreign lands, either as owners, heirs, or mortgagers, by citizens of the United States. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a protracted struggle in such close proximity to our own territory, without apparent prospect of an early ter mination, cannot be other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the affairs of other Pow ers, naturally desire to see every country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty, ami the blessings of free institutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should be come necessary, to spare no effort to pro tect the lives and property of bona file American citizens, and to maintain the dig nity of the tlair. it is hoped mat all pending questions with Spain growing oU: of the affairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of nonce and ' conciliation which has hi herto Guided the .,..!.- .;,f'. ; . two loeis l.l tneir treatment ot sucti ones- ; ' tions. ! To give impoitance, and to add to the ; eSiciency of our diplomatic relations with . Japan and China, and to further aid in re- hrfoii? cmocvaL, (hctr(olfc, taining the good opinion of those peoples, ancj to secure to the United States its share of ilui commerce destined to flow bet tree n those nations and the balance of the com mercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four Ameiican youths in each of those coun tries to serve as a part of the official family of our Ministers there. Our representa tives would not even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and of some other Powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for inter preters and translators upon natives of those countries who know our language imper fectly, or procure for the occasion the ser vices of employees in foreign business hous es, or the interpreters to other foreign Min isters. The national debt has been reduced to the extent of yO,057,12G 80 during the year; ami by the negotiation of national bonds, at a lower r::te of interest, the interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to be raised for the interest account is nearly $17,000,000 less than on the 1st of March, 18d9. It was highh desirable that this rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them. But, in view of the accomplishment of thesd de sirable ends ; of the rapid development of the resources of the country ; its increasing ability to meet large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in order to continue this rapid payment. I therefore recommend a modification of both the tariff and internal tax laws. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those collected from spirituous, vinous, and malt liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and from stamps. In readjusting the tariff I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing for the current expen ses of the Government, the interest account, ami a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest number. There are many articles not produced at home, but which enter largely into general consumption through articles which are manufactured at home, such as medicines compounded, fcc, fce., from which very lit tle revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. All such articles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable I would then recommend that it be made upon those articles which can best bear it without dis turbing home production or reducing the wages of American labor. 1 have not entered into figures, because to do so would be to repeat what will be laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws for collect ing the revenue pay collectors of customs small salaries, but provide for moieties, (shares in all seizures,) which, at principal ports of entry particularly, raise the com pensation of those officials to a large sum. It lias always seemed to me as if this sys tem must, at times, work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possession of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods lo enable them finally to make larger seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this sub ject. Continued fluctuations in the value of gold, as compared with the national curren cy, have a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the country in keeping up prices of all articles necessary in everyday life. It fosters a spirit of gam bling prejudicial alike to national morals and the national finances. If the question can be met as to how to give a fixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained. The report of the Secretary of the Navy show? an Improvement iu the number and efficiency of the naval force without material increase in the ex pense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted, and is being extended as fast as our material will admit, of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By this means we have heen enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more fre quently the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable, and generally to discharge more efficient ly tlie appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace, without exceeding the number of men or the expenditure authorized by law. The suggestions of the report ns to the necessity of increasing and improving the material of the navy, and the plan recouui iiuled for reducing the pcrt'jiinel of the service to a peace standard by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction of others, and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine, are well con sidered, and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the Department presided over by him are earnestly recommended to your special at tention. Especially do 1 recommend favorable con sideration of the plan for uniting the telegraphic system of the United State with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of tele graphing could be much reduced and the service as well, if not better rendered. It would secure the further advantage of extending tlia telegraph through portions of the country where private enterprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and, above' all, the efforts to bring a people widely separat?d into a community of interest, are always benefitted by a rapid intercommunication. Education, the groundwork of republican institutions, is encour aged by increasing the facilities to gather speedy news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap tiie benefit of such improvements will stimu late education. There has been imposed upon the Executive branch of the Government the execution of theaci of Congress approved April 20, 1871, and commonly known as the Kuklux law, iu a portion of tin State of South Caroiiua. The necessity of the course pursued wiil be demonstrated by the report of the Committee to Investigate Southern Outrages. Ua der the provisions of the above act, I iss'icda pro clamation calling the attention of the people of the United States to the sums, and declaring niv reluc tance to exercise any of the extraordinary "powers thereby conferred upon me, except in case of im perative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powers whenever it should become neeosary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States t lie peaceful enjovment of Vac rights guaranteed to them bv the Constitu tion and the laws." After the passage of this law, information was received from time to time that combinations of th. character referred to in this law existed, ami were powerful in many parts of the Southern Sra.es, particularly in certain counties in me htat'J ot Nlilth Carolina. Careful investigation T f; nU WT :l'trLil,Re.! that'in llin" CO!!a- ties of that State sich com!);natim3 were active and powerful, embracing a sufficient nrt;s.n nfti.,.: z:-ns to control the local authority and having among other things the object of depriving the emancipated class of tlie substantial lcnelit3 of fncdom, and of preventing the free political action of those citizens who did not sympathize with their own views. Among their operations were frequent scourgings and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all cases being citizens of different political senti ments from their own, or freed persons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands cf inoffensive and well-disposed citizens were the sufferers bv this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the 13th of October, 1871, a procla mation was issued, in terms of the law, calling upon the members of those combinations to disperse with in five days, and to deliver to the marshal or mili tary officers of the United Suites all arms, ammuni tion, uniforms, disguises, and other means and im plements used by them for carrying out their unlaw ful purposes. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in nine counties in that State. Direction was gh en that within the counties so designated per sons supposed, upon creditable information, to be members of such unlawful combinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United States, and delivered to the marshal, to be dealt with ac cording to law. In two of said counties, York and Spartanburg, many arrests have been made. At the last account, the number of persons thus arrested was one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred, whose criminality was ascertained to be of an in ferior degree, were released for the present. These have generally made confessions of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests, and notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial in the judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon as it appeared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous measures to enforce the law, many persons absconded, and there is good ground for supposing that all of such persons have violated the law. A full report of what has been done under this law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General. In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbar ism, repugnant to civilization, to decency and to the laws of the United States. Territorial officers, how ever, have been found who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity and with a due sense of sustaining the majesty of the law. Neither po lygamy nor any other violation of existing statutes will be permitted.within the territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the self-styled saints that we are now dealing, but with their prac tices. They will be protected in the worship of God according to tlie dictates of their consciences, but they wiil not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. It ma3r be advisable for Congress to consider what, hi the execution of the laws against polygamy, is to be the status of plural wives and their oltspring. Tlie propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing the Territorial Legislature of Utah to legitimize all children born prior to a time fixed in the act might be justified by its humanity to these innocent children. This is a suggestion only, and not a recommendation. The policy pursued towards the Indians lias re sulted favorably so far as can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation. Through the exertions of . the various societies of Christians to whom has been entrusted the execu tion of the policy, and the Board of Commissioners authorized by the law of April 10, 18G9, many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reserva tions, to cultivate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds, and to partially accept civili zation. They are being cared for in such a way, it is hoped, to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination. I renew my recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a heritage to our children, to be dis posed of only as required for occupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been in great part disposed of in such a way as to secure ac cess to the balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them. But caution should be exercised even in attaining so desirable an object. Educational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as recom mending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by the General Government for the encouragement of education. The report of the Commissioner of Agriculture gives the operations of his department for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of our prosperity, too much importance cannot be attached to the labors of this Department. It is in the hands of an able head, with able assistants, all zealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of the nation ail useful products adapted to any of the various climates ami soils of our vast territory, and to giving all useful information as to the method of cultivation, the plants, cereals and other products adapted to particular localities. Quietly, but sure!-, the Agricultural Bureau is working a great national good, and if liberally supported, the more widely its influence will be extended and the less dependent we shall be upon t'ae products of foreign countries. I have not given the estimates for the support of the Government for the ensuing year, nor the com parative statement between the expenditures for the year just passed and the one just preceding, because all these figures are contained in the accompanying reports or in those presented directly to Congress. These estimates have my approval. More than six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired between the armies then ar-raj-cd against each other, one for the perpetuation, the other for the destruction of the Union; it may well be considered whether it is now lime that the disabilities imposed by the fourteenth amendment should be removed. That amendment does not ex clude the ballot, but only imposes the disability to hold offices upon certain classes. 'When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities are sure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I do not see the advantage or propriety of excluding men from office merely because they were, before the. re bellion, of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take oaths to support the Constitution, and admitting to eligibility those entertaining precisely the same views but of less standing in their communities. It may be said that the former violated an oath, while the latter did not. The latter did not have it in their jKwer to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted they would have broken it as did the former class. If there are any great criminals, distinguished above all others for the part they took in opposition to the Government, they might," in the judgment of Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty. This subject is submitted for your careful consideration. The condition of the Southern States is, unhap pily, not such as all true, patriotic citizens would like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake, per sonal violence or threats toward persons entertain ing political views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens, prevent immigra tion and tiie flow of much needed capital into the States lately in rebellion. It wiil be a happy con dition of the country when the old citizens of these States will take an" interest in public affairs, pro mulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men representing their views, and tolerate the same free dom of expression and ballot in those entertaining different political convictions. The number of immigrants, ignorant of our laws, habits, &c, coming into our country annually has become so great, and the impositions practiced ujhui them so numerous and flagrant, that I suggest Con gressional action for their protection. It seems to inc a fair subject of legislation by Congress. I can not now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints mad" by immigrants of the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so during the sesdon of Congress, particularly if the subject should receive your attention. It has been the aim of the Administration to en force honesty and effickney in all public officer. Every public servant who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law. If bid ma havj secured places it has been the fault of the system establish ed by law and custom for making appropriations, or tiie fault of thus; who recommend for Govern ment positions persons not sufficiently well known to them personalty, or who give letters indorsing the characters of office-seekers without a proper sense of the grave responsibility which sach a course devolves upon them. A civil 'service reform which can correct this abuse is much desired. In mercan tile pursuits the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain creuitlrom a stranger is regarded as morally respon sible for the integrity of his friend and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law which would enforce tuis principle against all in iorsers of persons for public place would insure great caution ia making recommendations. A salutary lesson ha been taught the careless and the dishonest pa'- L. lie servant in the great number of prosecutions and convictions oi me las i jmio. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout the country in bringing to punishment those who have proven re creant to the trusts confided to them, and in ele vating to public office none but those who possess the confidence of the honest and the virtuous, who, it will always be found, comprise the majority of the community in which they live. In my message to Congress one year ago I urgent ly recommended a reform in the civil service of the country. In conformity with that recommendation Congress, ia the ninth section of "an act making ap propriations for sundry civil expenses of the Gov ernment and for other purposes," approved March 3, 1871, gave the necessary authority to the Execu tive to inaugurate a civil service reform, and placed upon him tlie responsibility of doing so. Under the authority of said act I convened a board of gentle men eminently qualified for tlie work, to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are not j-et complete, but it is believed that they will succeed in devising a plan which can be adopted to the great relief of the Executive, the heads of Departments, and members of Congress, and which will redound to the true interest of the public service. At all events the experiment shall have a fair trial. I have thus hastily summed up the operations of the Government during the last year, and made such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your consideration. I submit them with a confidence that your combined action will be wise, statesman like, "and ia the best interests of the whole country. U. S.
