DE LAMAR DOTS. The case of Vietti vs. Nesbitt Bros, v nnnnluded and submitted to the court at four o'clock in the afternoon of Friday last, Judge Talbot announced that he would take the case under advisement and render decision after he reached home, which would not be under a month's time as he was obliged to hold court first at Ely, The case of C. Lytle and others vs. Jos. Coumerilh, was then taken up and tried before the court sitting without a jury. This involves the right to some of the water flowing down from Spring Valley to Eagle Valley. The case was concluded Saturday afternoon and was likewise taken under ad visement by the court. In the matter of a motion for a new trial in the case of Chas. Craw vs. Frauk Wilson, tiied last spring here, the motion was do nied. It is announced now that the case will be appealed to the Supreme Court. A motion for a new trial has been filed by Nesbitt Bros., in the case of Sawyer vs. Cohen and ethers. This motion will be submitted at the next sitting of court which is looked for about March next. The case of Livingston & Co., vs. J. J. Manning and John K. Ferguson, determined the defendants, will be appealed to th Supreme Court. i hn' proceeds which were turned over to !;. - load thea irien were 10C- nd lastly Professor Foster says that the next storm toered wave will reach the Pacifio coast about the Jj"?!

Under the new law that particular office is abolished and it ia provided that the Attorney-General shall be ez-offioio Clerk of the Supreme Court, prominent lawyers hold that the law is un constitutional, and, as s matter of course, the appointment of a Clerk will be particu larly necessary. The two offices conflict with each other in many respects. How an attorney before a court can aot aa its clerk, ia a question which needs solution. Tribune Commissioner's Proceedings. The Board of County Commiasioners met on December 3rd, and T, E. Edwards and J. Conaway were present. The minutes of last meeting were read and approved. It moved, seconded and carried that the bill of J. D. Campbell of $50 for holding a post mortem ou Eliza Lawaon, be taken up; the bill was then allowed. It was moved and seconded that the order to sell the house to Joe Barney, formorly owned by Geo Bly in Logan, be rescinded if payment on the same has not been paid. The petition for a Justice oflice in De Lamar was considered and the same reject- 1. It was ordered that the several county official bonds be fixed as fallows, and that they qualify and file said bonds on or before the first Monday in January: Assessor and Sheriff, $15,000; Clerk, $10,000; Treasurer, 420.000: Recorder. $5,000; District Attorney, $2,000; Publio Administrator, $1,000; Justice of the Peace $1,000. An order was made to trausfer $1521.52 from the General County Fund to the Salary Fund and that all money coming into the General Fund be transferred to the Salary Fund until all back salaries are paid up. No further business appearing the Board adjourned. Our Next Legislature.

Flanni Friday was pay for the DeLamar Co. for the month of November, consequently the town has been somewhat lively the past week. Nesbitt & Bro., have a small force of men at work on the Cedar Springs ditching from one spring to another and concentrating the water all at one point with a view to piping it to town shortly. District Attorney Culverwell was brought over from Meadow Valley Wash on Tuesday quite ill, having Buffered a relapse since his sickness of two weeks ago. He is regarded as in a dangerous condition. The weather this week has been uniformly bad. This is the first good day of the week, wind, snow, hail and rain predominating up to this time. No trace of snow remains however, except on the mountaiu sides. The strangers to this climate from the far north must hegiu to have a good opinion of it as compared with the eections from whence they came. The bad weather of this week it the worst we have and it isn't a ciruumstanne to what they have been ac customed to. When the cold and storm struck us, the water pipe of the DeLamar Company was about ready to be tested, none of the pipe being covered over. The cold has been in tense enough to freeze the water in many places and it is believed considerable of the pipe will be injured beyond repair. The leasers on the Gold Cup report a fine body of ore in the north drift from the bottom of the fifty-foot shuft. This drift is seventy -five feet in length and all in ore averaging nearly $40 in gold. No ore is being taken out except which is actually neceasary. All the work now being done is to thoroughly develop the property. There is about fifteen tons of this grade of ore on the dump. Lode. The Strikers Acquitted. J. C. March, Thos Clcary, Chas. Kappler, Sam Howard aud James Cummings, the strikers who have been on trial at Carson for several days were acquitted by the U. S. jury, says toe lteno Journal, lhe case was submitted during the latter part of the day, and the jury, after twenty minutes ilelibcra tion, brought in a unanimous verdict of not guilty. The citizens of Carson were so jubilant over the result of the trial that they rang the fire bells, fired anvils and otherwise celebrated. This ends the matter and notwithstanding that every effort has been made to convict the defen danta it has proved a failure after two tedious trials. M Bcbaufer..

Hay is selling in Mason Valley for $3 per ton. In the case of J. M. Zion vs. the Southern Pacific, at Reno recently, a verdiot was rendered yesterday awarding the defendant $1,700. Mr. Zion was put off a S. P. train oy a conductor who had suspicions that he was riding on a scalpers ticket. The ticket was genuine however, and Zion brought suit to recover $0,000 damages. The jury brought in a verdict of $1,700 damages for the plaintiff. Virginia Enterprise. It is quite evident that there are still some men in Nevada who don't exactly understand how to vote the Australian ballot. In the recount in Humboldt county twenty-eight votes were cast at Rebel Creek, and not one of them had the narrow per forated strip with the number on torn off. This is in direct violation of the law, as a simple reference to the poll book would show how every man voted. The Commiasioners decided that the Rebel Creek ballots were legal and connted them. If President Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle were in earnest ia suggesting a plan of currency reform for adoption during the present session of Congress they should un questionably borrow the charter of the bank of England as a model. Under the English system new notes can only be issued in ex change for an equal value of gold deposited in the bauk of England. This being the case it follows, as a matter of course, that President and Mr. Carlisle are only trying to distract Congress from the consideration of the importance to reopening our mints to the free coinage of Bilver by advocating a banking plan which they would be the first to condemn if Congress showed any disposi tion to accept it.

Hartley came up on the 7th inst. W. E. F. Deal and District Attorney Curler appear ing for the State and Judge Goodwin, E. R. Dodge and R. M. Clarke for the defendant. Mrs. Hartley was not present. The ques tion arose regarding the rendering of a de cision on the motion for a new trial in the absence of the defendant from court. Physicians' certificates were offered, show ing that Mrs. Hartley was physically unable to be in oourt, the matter was then post poned until 9 o'clock Saturday morning. A large orowd was present in the court-room at the time set. The arguments on the motion for a new trial and also on a motion in arrest of judgment were continued all the forenoon. In the afternoon Judge Cheney took the case under advisement until the 12th. when bis decision will be rendered. Reno Journal. The Kingman (Ariz.) Miner says that the White Hills Company have a batter showing in the lower level of the Occident mine than ever. The mill ia turning out bullion and shipping about $25,000 to Denver every mouth. The San Francisco Call says the Wellman Peck & Co. firm propose to run mule teams between their stores in San Francisco and their branch store in Fresno until such times as the Southern Pacific Company may establish fair rates. One of the firm is re ported as saying: "We paid them (the Southern Pacific) thousands of dollars for carrying our canned goods to Fresno at the 75-cent rate when the rate on the same class of goods from New York to this place was only 50 cents." This is a condition of things that Mr. Irving M. Scott might study to ad. vantage. Some days ago Mr. Scott was commenting upon the absurdity of a fruit- producing state like California importing its canned fruit. We see now the reason, or at least one of the reasons, A railroad com pany which pretends to be working in the interest of California brings canned fruit from New York at a less charge than it makes from San Francisco to Fresno. Senator Stewart, when called upon for his opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury's scheme to give the banks complete control of the currency, which the President rec commmended in his message to Congress, said: "The financial plan in Cleveland's message, stripped of verbiage, means that the United States shall give bankers $75 for $22.50. Any bank that will deposit $22.50 of legal tender, whether greenbacks or treasury notes, will receive $75 of our Gov ernment money a cunning way of retiring greenbacks." Reno Journal. Before his last election to the Presidency, Mr. Cleveland was constant, in season and out of season, in telling the country how the rich were getting richer and the poor poorer under the Republican protective policy. What a pity it is that he found no space in his voluminous and platitudinous message to tell his fellow oitizens how both the rich and the poor hare been getting poorer ever since his party obtained absolute control of the legislative and executive branches of the Government. Edison says there is practically no limit to the speed that can be attained on a rail road. He thinks the greatest speed will come when electricity is obtained direct from coal.
