President Hrd- lnf, addressing congress In person to day on. tbe state of the Union, placed the transportation situation. - prohibition enforcement and farm credits In - the forefront of the national problems pressing for solution. Also he took occasion to reply direct ly to those who he said had assumed that the United States had taken Itself "aloof and apart, unmindful of world abllcatlons." He declared taese" gave "scant credit" for the "helpful part-1 America had assumed In International relations, . referring particularly to the arms conference. Of the 'nrohlbltlon situation, the ex ecutive asserted there were conditions of enforcement "which savor of nation wide scandal.'' He made no .recammen dattons on this score, but announced his -purpose to call an early .conference of the governors of the states .and ter- Htorie swith the federal authorities to formulate definite policies of national and stale co-operation .

State Fuel Ad ministrator Thomas W. Russell today sent messages to local fuel administra tors and individual coal dealers urging the necessity of using substitutes for domestic anthracite coal and maintain ing fair distribution to all consumers. The message to ioal dealers through out the state was as follows: "In view of the small reserves of an thracite in this state, I expect every coal dealer to do his utmost to spread distribution of domestic coal so that every family needing coal may receive some. This is necessary to prevent suffering, which must be avoided, ft possible, and can be If dealers will re cognize their duty to the public. Washington, Dec. 8. President Hard ing In his annual message delivered today to congress in person deals with nearly, a soore of subjects, chief among them pro hibition, farm credits, the transportation problem, child labor and Immigration. , He announces his purpose to Invite the Final Reparations Terms For Germany Are Expected to be Formulat ed at Series of Conferences Beginning in London ' To day. London, Dec 8 (By the A. P.). The premiers of France, Italy and Belgium, with staffs of financial experts, arrived in London today for what is generally described as the most critical conference of - the four years' succession of confer ences which have struggled to fix definite and final reparations terms for Germany. Tomorrow the premiers will meet with Prime Minister Bonar Law to begin the discussions, set to last through the week end. if not Into the early part of the coming week. It will h a meeting of nun hA 1leva not worked together before. Mr. Bonar Law will enter his first con ference as prime minister. The French had come to regard Mr. Lloyd George as too friendly toward Germany, and though there has been nothing thus far In Mr. Bonar Law's utterances of policy to give direct encouragement, they hope, as It was expressed in French quarters onlght, to find him more sympathetic toward France than his predecessor.

Tom Johnson, leader of the laborites, was on his feet at the opening of the session with a demand for a statement from the government. President Cos mv neremntorilv refused. but Mr. Johnson pressed his demand, whereupon j years. the president appealed to the chairman to proceed with the scheduled business, the election of a committee on the ap pointment of ministers.

Mr. Johnson found opportunity to make the labor position clear at adjournment. He strongly denounced the government for indulging in reprisal executions and pointed out that the men executed had never been given trial, being confined in prison for an offense dating back to last July.

Baron Hayashl added that the address of Lord Carton, the Biiusn foreign minister.' had assured him that a solution ot the straits question was n earing. Lord Curzon opened the session with a long detailed review of the points on which the Turks differed from the en tente plans, and replied to questions on which Ismet Pasha had asked further In formation at the morning session. It's sddrees indicated that most of the ques tions on which the entente and tbe Turl-e differed were proper sobjects for discus sion In an informal way by military and naval experts, and expressed the opinion that suoh discussion would Bring forward the necessary technical information which would undoubtedly form the basis for agreement.

In opening the session - Lord Curzon said he was glad the Turk had accepted the principle of demilitarized zones on the straits, provided they were assured accepted the principle of the free passage ot warsaips saa merchantmen In times of peace or war. and also in principle an In ternational commission to regulate com mercial navigation. He added that the Turks had laid down the bai of the regime they desired to eee applied to the straits, and that It ac-aned possible to harmonize this with the entente views. The Turks wlthtfrew th'r r' Ciestlon that the sowers should not be allowed to maintain warships In tho Black sea, so that this question was not discussed at the afternoon meeting. Takttg up In order the suggestions Ismet Pasha mads at the rooming session, on w'Vii Turkey desired farther explanation. Lord Curzon said that on the question of guarantee's so that Constantinople would be fres from attack, the allies felt the allied nrs. posals were adequate, so far as military and naval guarantees were concerned. Hs indicated, however, th-t as in the ease of Thrace, further international guaran tees oi a political character were worthy ot consideration. This question had hern a ma'-ter of study on the oert of allied jurists in order to reconclio their views. On Ismet Pasha's suggestion that there should bo a limitation of naval forces en tering the Black sea. Lord Curmn de clared he thought the principle laid down by the allies was sound but that the ai- " lies were willing to Interpret It tn a lib eral way and felt sure a satisfactory for mula could be worked out after oomrver sarions. Commenting on Isrr.et Pii's point that there should be liberty of pes-aas through the straits in peace and war for commercial ships, with Turkey having the right of search In case she was at war. Lord Curzon said the allies were screed. While the British forelsn mlnirter raid the allies fcelieved the Sea of Mamma could not be definitely er-luded from tho demilitarized zones, as Ismet Puma de sired, because the sea Is a K-eocnphical continuation of the strait a. It was quits possible, without Interfering with the light of free passage, for the defense ot the Sea of Marmora within certain lim its, and this question doubtless could be worked out by the experts. Replying to Ismet Pasha's contention that the demilitarized none was too large. Lord Curzon said it might be possible te make changes tn It tn the vicinity of Coa stsntlnople. The allies, he added, woald grant the request, of the Turks that Turkish troops'be permitted to cross from one side of the demilitarized sone to an other. If - they were In transit. As te Ismet Pasha's suggestion " that Turkey must have arsenals in the demilitarized zones. Lord Curzon declared this ques tion would not be difficult to settle but that It. could naturally netter be consid ered when the military and naval clues of tho treaty were reached.
