R, 6kit Je*bi MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT. THE RESTORATION OF THE SOUTH. EKN STATES AGAIN URGED UPON CONGRESS. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS, dec. Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Rtpreseutativei ; After a brief interval the Congre?s of the United States resumes its annual legislative labors. An all-wise and merciful Provi dence has abated the pestilence which visit ed our shores, leaving its calamitous traces upon some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquillity, and civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole of the United States. In all of the States civil authority has superceded the coercion of arms, and the people, by their voluntary aclion.are maintaining their governments in full activity and complete operation. The enforcement of the laws is no longer "obstructed in any State by co r.- binations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings"' and the animosities engendered bv the w-r are rapidlv yielding to the benefictent influ ences of our free institutions, and to the kindly effects of our unrestricted social and commercial intercourse. An entire restor ation of fraternal feeling must be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart ; and we will have accomplished our grandest national achievement when,forgetting the sad events of the past, and reim-mK-ring only their in structive lessons, we resume our onward career as a free, prosperous, and united people. In mv message of the 4-th of December, 1865,'-.ongress was irsf uucd ofthe meas ures which had been iiLStittit.il by the Exe cutive with a view to the gradual resto a tion of the States in which t'ie insurrection occurred to their relations with the General Government. Provisional Governors bad been appointed, Conventions call -d. Gov ernors elected, Legislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress of tiie United States Courts had been opened for the enfoi cement of laws long in abeyance. The blo. kade bad bei n removed, custom-hou-es re establish ed, and the internal revenue laws - |Hit in force, in order that the people might con tribute to the national income. I'osial op erations had been r:iiewed,and efforts were being made to restore tin into th. ir fonner condition of efficiency. The .States them selves had been asked to lake pait in the high function o amending the ( gnsiiiut'on and of thus sanctioning tip- extinction of African slavery as one of the legitimate re sults of our internecine struggle. llaving progressed tin*- fur, the Execu tive Department found that it had accom plished nearly all that was within the scope of its constitutional author ty. One tinner, however, yet remain to I**. done before the work of restoration could be completed, aml that was the admission t<> Congress of loyal Senators and Representatives from tie- States whose people had rebelled agu fist the lawful authority ot tfieGeheral Govern ment. This question devolved upon the re spective Houses, which by the Const itui ion, are made the judges of the elections, re turns, and qualifications of their own mem bers, and its consideration at once engaged the attention of Congress. In the meantime, the Executive Depart ment — no other plan having been proposed by Congress—continued its efforts to per fect, as far as was practicable, the resto a tion of the proper relation between the ci tizens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time to time, as the public interest seem to requite, the judicial, revenue, and postal systems of the Country. With the advice and consent of the Senate, the r.p cessary officers were appointed, and appro priations made by Congress for the pay ment of their salaries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution, so as to prevent the existence of slaverv within tln- United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction was. ratified by the requisite number of States, and on the 18th day of December, 1865, it was officially declared to have become valid as a part ot the Con stitution of the United States. All of tie- States in which insurrection bad existed promptly amended their Constitutions, so as to make them conform to the greai change thus effected in the organic law of the land ; declared null and void all ordi nance-sand laws of ecession ; repudiated all pretended debts and obligations created for the revolutionary purposes ol the insur rection ; and proceeded, in good faith, to tho enactment of measures for the projec tion and amelioration of the condition of the colored race. Congress, h .wever, yet hesitated to admit any of these States to representation ; and it was i?t until to wards the close of the eighth month of the session that an exception was made iff fa vor of Tennessee, by the admission of her Senators and Representatives, I deem it a subject of jff'.found regret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to sea;s loyal Senators and Representatives from the other States, whose inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had ejgaged in the rebellion. Ten States—more than one fourth of the whole number —remain with out representation ; the seats ol fifty mem bers in the House ot representatives and of twenty members 111 the Senate arc yet va cant—not by* their own consent, not by a failure of election,but by the refusal of gresfl to accept their credentials, ThtdflW misaion, it is believed, would have accom plished much towards the renewal and "TO

TUiYKHANNOCK, PA., WEDNESDAY, DEC. 12. 18.66 strengthening of our relations as one people and re-noved serious cause for discontent on the pait of the inhabitants ot those States. . It wouid have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the Declara tion of American Independence, 'hat no people ought to hear the burden of taxation, and yet. be denied the right of representa tion, It would have been in consonance with the express provisions of the Constitu tion, that "each State shall have at least one Representative," and "that no State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate," These pro visions were intended to S'-cure to every State, and to the people of every State, the right of representation in each House of Congress ; and so important was it deemed bv the framers of the Constitution that the equality of the States in the Senate should be preserved, that not even by an amend ment of the Constitution can any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch ot the National Legislature. It w true, it has been assumed that the existence of the States was terminated by the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that the insurrection having been suppress ed, lliey wi re thenceforward to be con sidered merely as c-"queted territories The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Departments of the Government hav •, however, with great distinctness and uni form consistency, refused to sanction an a-sumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican svslt m: and with the pro fessed objects of the war Throughout the recent legislation of Congress, the undenia ble fact makes itself apparent, that these ten political communities are nothing less than States of this Union. At the very commencement of the rebellion, each House j declared, willi a unanimity us remarkable I as it wa- significant, that the war was not waged, npoti our part, in any spirit of op presaion, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose .f overt hi <>w iugor interfering with the tights or estab lished iiiftitutions of those Slates, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursu ance thei'Hjf, and to preserve the Union wall all the dignity, t quality, and rights of the several Stales unimpaired ; and that as soon a- these obj -cts weie "accomplish ed the War ought, to cease." In some in stances Senators were permitted to contin ue their leg.slaxive functions, while in other instances Representatives wets elected and •idinittt-d to scats after their Stares ha 1 for nialU declared their right to withdraw from :lie Union, and were endeavoring to main tain that right by force of aims. All >flhe Stat's whose people were in insurrection, is States, were included in the apportion ment ot the direct tax of twenty millions of dollars annually laid upon the United States by the act approved sth August, 1st)I. Congress, by the act of March 4th, 1861, and by the appoitionment of repre sentation thereunder also recognized their presence a> States in tie Union ; and they nave, for judicial purposes, been divid.d into districts, as States alone can be divided. I'lli* satne recognition appears in the recent fegi-lation in reference to Tennessee,which ovideidh rests upon tho factthat the func tions of the >tate wt-ie not destroyed by rite rebellion, but merely suspended ; and that principle is of course applicable to th.se States, which, like Tennessee, tt'-mpted to renounce their places in the IT • '• J J *tton* The action of the Executive Department of the Government upon th s subject has been iqilady d finite and uniform, and tin purpose of the war was specific dly stated in the Proclamation issued by my predecessor on the 22d day of September. 1802. It was then solemnly proclaimed and declared that "hereafter, as heretofore, the war will— be. prosecuted for the object of practically ie storiug the constitutional relation between I he United States and each of the States and the people thereof, irr which States that re lation is or may be suspended or disturb ed," '* The recognition of tho States by the Ju dicial Department of the Government has also been dear and cmclus ve in all pro eeedings affeetit g thero a-< Slates, had in the. Supreme, Ciicu t and District Courts In the admission ofSenaturs and Ilepre sentutivf#from any and all of the Stales, there can be no just ground of apprehen sion that persons who are disloyal will he clothed v.th the powers of l gislation ; fori this could not happen win n the Constitu tion and the jaws are enforced by a vigi tant and faithful Congress. Fucb house is made the "Judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own m mliers," and may, "with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member." When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election, lie may at once be admitted or re p-cted; or should there be any question as lo hi* eligibility, bis credentials may be te- Icrrvd for investigation to the appropriate committee- be upon evid.-nce satisfactory to tiio J ous ? of which he thus becomes a member, that •he possesses the requisite Constitutional aud legal qualifications. If refused admis sion as a member for want of due allogians to the Government, and returned to his constituents, they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed a voice in the Legislative Councils of the nation, and the political power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in tho interest* of loyally to the Government and fidelity to the Union. Up-n this question, so vitally affecting the restoration ot the Union and the permfth ncy of our present form of goverumout, my convictions, heieiofore ex- pressed, bate undergone no change; but* on the contrary, tlieir eomctness has been confirmed by rifhction and lime. It the admission of loval un-tubeis to seats in the respective House ot Congress was wise and expedient a year g<>* it is no less wise and expedient now. If this onomalous condi tion is right now—if. in the exact condition of these Stales at the present time, it is lawful to exclude them front repiesuntation. I do not see that the question will be chang ed bv the efflux of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will be no stronger —the right of exclusion will be uo weakir. The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to re commend to the consideration of Congress " such measures as he shall judge necessa ry or expedient." I know of no mcasurq more imperatively demanded by every con sideration of national interest, sound poli cy, and equal justice, than the admissions of loyal members froin the now unrepre sented States. This would consummate the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary influence in the re-establishraent of peace, haimony and fraternal feeling.— It would tend greatly to renew the confi dence of the American people in the vigor and stability of their institutions. It wu'd hind us more closely together as a nation, and enable us to show to the world the in herent ami recuperative power of a Gov ernment tonn<led upon the will of the peo pie, and established upon the principles of liberty; justice and intelligence. Our in creased strength ami enhancee prosperity would irref'ragably demonstrate the fallacy 4.fthe arguments against free itisikuiioii drawn tiom our recent national ijprders by the enemies of republican government. The admission of loyal niemoers from the State now excluded from Congress, by al laying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital now awaiting an opportunity for investment, into the channels of trade and industry. It would alleviate the present coud tion of tlne States, and, by inducing emigration, aid in the settlement of fertile regions how urn uliivated, and had to an increased production of thost staples which have added >."> greatly to the wealth of the nation and the commerce of the world. — New fields of enterprise would he opened to our progressive people, ami soon the de vastations of war would be repaired, ami all traces of our domestic differences effac ed fhni the mind of our countrymen. In our efforts to preserve " the unity of Government which constitutes us one peo ple," by restoring the States to the condi tion whicltthey held prior to the rebellion, we should be cautious, lest, having rescued our nation from perils of threatened disin tegration, we r< sort to 4 consideration, and in the end absolute despotism. a< a remedy for the n currence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, ami with it all oc casion for the exercise of powers of doubt ful constitutionality, we should hasten to bring legislation wuhin the boundaries pi escribed by the Constitution, and to re turn to the ancient landmarks established by our fathers for the guidance of succeed ing generations. ''The Constitution which at anV time exists, until c tanged bv an ex plicit and autbet tic act of the whole peo ple, is sacredly obligatory upon all.'' '"lf, in the opinion of the people, the distribu thin or modification of the constitutional powers be, in anv particular'wifing, h t it be corrected by an amendment in the way in which the Constitution designates. Hut let there be no i-hange by us. rpation, for it is the customary weapon by Vliicli free Governments are destroyed." Washing ton spoke these words to his countrymen when, followed by their love and gratitude, he voluntarily retired from the cares of public life. "To keen in a'l tilings with in the p; le of our constitutional powers, and cherish the F deral Union as the only rock of saf ty," were prescribed by Jcft'ei son as rules of action to endear to his "conn try men the true principles of their Consti tution, and promote a union of sentiment and action equally auspicious to their hap piness and safety.'' Jackson held that the action of the Gen eral Government should always be strictly confined to the sphere of its apniopriate rhitie-, and justly and forcibly urged that our Government is n<-t to be maintained nor our Union preserved "by invasions of the rights and powers of the several State*, lli thus attempting to make our General Government strong, we make it weak. Its true strength consists in leaving individuals and States as much as possible to them selves; 111 making itself felt, not in its pow er, but in its beneficence; not in its control but in its protect tun ; not in binding the States more closely to the centre, but leav ing each to move unrestructdl in its proper constitutional orl-it.' These are the teach ings of men whose deeds and set vies have made tin m i lustrious, and who, long since wit'drawn from scenes of life, have left to heir country the rich legacy of their i xamp'e, their wisdom, and their patriot ism. Prawing ftcsh inspiration frotn their lessons, let us emulate them in love of country and respect for th e Constitution and th> laws. Tl.e report of the Secretary of the Treas ury affords much information respecting the revenue and commerce of the country. His views upon the currency, and with reference to a proper adjustment of our revenue system, yitcrnal as well as impost, are commended to the careful considera tion of Congress. In roy I$M annual mes sage I expressed ray general views upon theso subjects. 1 need now only call atten tion to the necessity of carrying into every department of the Government a system of rigid accountability, through retrench ment, anu wise economy, With no excep tional nor unusual expenditures, the op pressive burdens of taxation can be lessoned by snch a modification of our revenue laws as will be consistent with the public faith, and the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a much more factory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sanguine could have anticipated. During the fiscal year end ing the 30th June, 1805, the last year of the war, the public debt was increased ♦941.902,537, and on the 31st of October, 1865, it announced to $2,740,864,750 On the 31st day of October, 1866, it had been reduced to 12,551,310,006, the dimi notion, during a period of fourteen munths commencing September 1, 1865. and end ing October 31, 1866, having been $206,- 379,565, In Jie last annual report on the >tate of the finances, it was estimated that during the three quarters of the fiscal year ending the 30tb of June last, tlfe' debt would lw increased $112,194.947. — During that period, however, it was re duced $31,196,387, the receipts of the year having been $89,905,905 more, and the expenditures 8200,529,235 less thau the estimates. Nothing Could more clear ly indicate than these statements the ex tent and of the national re sources, and ftbt rapidity and safety with winch, under ©nr form of government, great military and naval establishment can be disbanded, and expenses reduced from a war to a peace footing. During the fiscal year ending the 30tb of June, 1866, the receipts were $558,032- 620, and the expenditures $520,750,940, leaving an available surplus of $37,281, 680, It is estimated that the receipts for the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 18C7, will be $476,061,386, and that the expenditures will reach the sum of $316,- 428,078, leaving in the Treasury a surplus of $158,33.308. For the fiscal year end ing June 30, 1868, it is estimated that the receipts will amount to $436,000,000, and that the expenditures will be $350.*247,t>41 —showing an excess ot $85,752,359 in favor of the Government. These estima ted receipts may be diminished by a re duction of excise and import duties; but after all necessary reductions shall have been made, the revenue of the present and of following years will doubtless be'suffi cient to cover all legitimate charges upon the Treasury, and leave a large annual surplus to be applied to the payment of the principal of the debt. There seems now to be no good reason why taxes may not be reduced as the country advances in population and wealth, and yet debt be extinguished within the next quarter ola century The report of the Secretary of War fur nishes valuable and important information in reference to the operations of his De partment during the past year. Few vol unteers now remain in the service, and they are being discharged as rapidly as th p can be replaced by regular troops.- The army has been promptly paid, careful lv provided with medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and is to be fur nished with breech-loading small arms.— The military strength of the nation has been unimpaired by the discharge of vol unteers, the disposition of unserviceable or perishable stores, and the retrenchment ■ of expenditure. Sufficient war material to meet any emergency has been retained, and, from the disbanded volunteers stand ing ready to respond to the national call, large armies can be rapidly organized equipped, and concentrated, bonifica tions on the coast and frontier have re ceived, or are being prepared for more powerful armaments; lake surveys and barber and river improvements are in course of energetic prosecution. Prepara tions have been made for the payment of the additional bounties authorized during the recent session of Congress, under such regulations as will protect the Government from fraud, and secure to the honorably discharged soldier the well-earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantly. More than six thousand maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs or other surgical apparatus; and forty one national eemeta ries, containing the remains of 104,526 Union soldiers, have already been estab lished. The total estimates of military appropriations i 5525.205,669. It is stated in the report of tho Secreta ry of the Navy, that the naval force at tlds time consists of two hundred and sev enty-' igbt armed with two tliou :and three liundrtd and fifty-one guns.— Of these, one hundred and fifteen vessels, carrying one thousand and twenty-nine guns, are in commission, distributed chief iy among Mfven squadroons. The number iofinen in the sendee is thirteen thousand six hundred. Great activity and vigil ance- have been displayed bv all the squad toons.and their movements have been judi oiotisly and i ffi iently arra tged in such 1 manner as would best promote American commerce, and perfect the rights and in terests of our countrymen abroad. The vessels unemployed are undergoing re pairs, or are laid up until their services may be required. Most of the iron-clad fleet is at League Island, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, a place which, until decisive action should be taken by Congress, was 1 selected by the Secretary of the a* J the most eligible location for that class of i vessels. It is important that a suitable | public station should be provided for the j iron clad fleet. It is ioteuded that these | vessels be in proper condition for any emer gency, and it is desirable that the bill ac* cepting League Island for naval purposes, j which passed the Houte of Kepreteata- 'FBItMS, 18.00 PBH. tives at its last session, should receive final action -t an early period,in order that there may be a suitable public station for tbie class of vessels, as well as a navy-yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service, on the Delaware river. The Naval Pen sion fund amounts to $11,750,000 having been increased $2,750,000 during the year. The expenditures of the Depart ment for the fiscal year ending 30th of June last were $43,324,526 and the esti mates for the coming year amount to $23,- 568,436. Attention is invited to the con dition of our seamen, and the importance 'of legislative measures for their belief aud improvement. The suggestions in behalf of this deserving class ol our fellow citizens are earnestly recommended to the favora ble attention of Congress. The report of the Postmaster General presents a most satisfactory condition of the postal service, ami submits recommen dations which deserve the consideration of Congress The revenues of the depart ment for the year ending June 30,1866, were $14,386,989, and the expenditures 2*15,352,0/9, showing an excess of the lat ter 0f5965,093. In anticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropria tion waa made by Congress in the act ap proved July 28, 1866. Including the standing appropaiation of $700,000 for free mail matter, as a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remaining unexpend ed, the actual deficiency for the past year is only $265,093—a sum within $51,141 of the amount estimated iu the tiunual re port of 1864. Ihe decrease of revenue compared with the previous year was one and one fifth per cent., and the increase of expenditures, owing principally to the en— laig- of the mail service in the South, • was twelve per cent. On. the 30th of June last there were in operation six thou sand nine hundred and tliiity mail routes, with an aggregate length of one hundred and eighty thousand nine hundred and twenty-one miles, an aggrega'e annual transportation of seventy one million eght hundred and thirty seven thousand nine hundied and fourteen miles, and an aggregate annual cost, including all ex-* penditures, of $8,410,184. The length ot railroad routes is thirty two thousand and ninety two miles, and the annual transportation thirty million six hundred nine thousand four hundied and sixty miles. The length of steamboat routes is fourteen thousand three hundred and forty six mtfes, and the annual transporta tion three million four hundred and eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty two miles. Ihe mail set vice is rapidlv in creasing throughout the whole country, and its steady extension in the Southern btates indicates their constantly improving condition. The growing importance of the foreign service also merits attention. Lhe Post Office Department of Great Brit ain and our own have agri ed upon a pre- • limnarv basis for a new Postal Conven tion, which it is believed will prove emi nently beneficial to the commercial inter— tcrests of the L nited States, inasmuch as it contemplates a reduction of the interna tional letter postage to one half the exist ing rates ; a reduction of postage with all other countries to and from which corres pondence is transmitted in the British mail, or in Closed mails through the Uni- Kingdom ; the establisnment of uni form and reasonable charges for the sea and territorial transit of correspondence in closed mails ; aud an allowance to each. Post Office Departrn t r.t of the right to use all mail communications established under the authority of the other for the despatch ot correspondence, either in open or closed mails, on the same term those applicable to the inhabitants of the country providing the means of transportation. r l he report of the Secretary of the In terior exhibits the condition of those branches of the pub'ic service which are committed to his supervision. During the iast fiscal year four million six hun dred and twenty—nine thousand three hun dred and twelve acres of public land were) disposed of, one million eight hundred and ninety—two thousand five hundred and six teen act es of which were entered under the homestead act. Ihe policy originally adopted relative to the public land's has undergone essential modifications. Imme diate revenue, and not their rapid settle ment, was the cardinal feature of our land svstem. Long experience and earnest discussion have resulted in the conviction that ihe early devetopement of our agri cultural resources, and the diffusion of an energetic population over our va-t territo ry, are objects of far gieater in pottance to the national growth and prosperity than the proceeds of the sale of the land to the high- st bidder in open njjrket. The pre-emption laws confer upon the pioneer who complies with the terms they impose the privilege of purchasing a limitid portion of "utioffered lands' at the mini inum price. The homestead enactments relieve the settler from the payment ot" purchase money, and secure hiui a perma nent home, upon the condition of ri-eidonce for a term of years. This liberal policy invites emigration from ihe old, and lroin the more crowded portions of the new world. Its propitious resulteare undoubt ed, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to it a wider development. Congress has made liberal gran's of public land to corpoiatian*, in aid of the construction ot railioads aud other internal improvements. Should this policy here after prevail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful 1 applioatiou of the fund, The title to the 1 lauds should not pan, by patent VOL. 6 NO. 19,
