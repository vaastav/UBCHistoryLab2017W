EDITORS GENERALLY APPROVE; THE DOCUMENT. Lacks Flash and Dash of Roosevelt Papers, But Makes Safe and Comfortable Reading. from the Xotv York Sun. The negative qualities of President i Taft's tirst annual message to Congress command our instant attention and ad miration. It is a notable document. Not , a single paragraph or line is propagandle in the recently familiar sense. No part of it Is a sermon or exhortation or parable or moral essay or disquisition upon remote and extraneous subjects of human interest. There is in no passage any incitement to passionate thinking on the part ?ff any class of citizens. For the first time In about eight years there is published to the country an annual mes sage which is accompanied by not the faintest suspicion of a yellow supple ment. Temperate. Kr?m Ui?? New WnrH. Throughout the message Mr. Taft is moderate in his views and temperate in speech. He has no startling novelties to offer, no catchwonls to tickle the ear and no appeals to class prejudices. When lie advances a reform he does it patiently and ddilierately and after full considera tion of its bejirins on present conditions. With Mr. Taft the administration of the government is apparently a plain matter of business in the public interest, not a game to be played for personal amuse ment or political effect. Old-Fashioned. Vroui tlie New York Tribune. President Taft's message both in com- ! pass and in character resembles the old- j fashioned presidential messages more than those to which the nation has been accustomed in recent years. The return to the old type is accomplished by re >ervintr for discussion in special messages his views concerning the most important economic and political topics. Conservu- . Hon and the amendment of the anti-trust j and interstate commerce acts are to be | made the subject of future messages, i They will thus attract greater attention ' and receive tnoro thorough discussion, j and they do not immediately thrust aside I A variety of routine matters which it is necessary to present to Congress and the country. Times Have Changed. Fr?ni the New York Times. The time that has elapsed since tiie i last annual message of President Taft's 1 predecessor was sent to Congress is but j the span of a single year. yet. if we may judge by comparison with the message sent in yesterday, how great a change has come over the spirit and affairs of this people! We no longer see the wrinkled front and the clinched teeth: the male factors of great wealth have fled to their hiding places, or, it may be, are reserved for later consideration: in all the land there is no hint of any conspiracy against the administration; the hostile press has been won over or forgiven, and over the printed panes a benignant countenance seems to look forth upon a world of peace, the countenance of a man and a President considering in calmness and with a philosophical mind what recom mendations for the public welfare he shall make to the Congress. Mr. Taft appears to have written under the con viction that this nation is, after all, in the main living a wholesome life; he has written, too. ami for that all men will be grateful, with a due sense of the short ness of life, insomuch that we are not asked to read a message of twenty-two printed columns. A Cheerful Message I nun th<- .New York HernM. The sober and dignitied tone of the President's message and its optimistic prediction that the country is on the eve of :t substantial business expansion makes a favorable impression in business and financial circles. That his promise to deal with needed amendments to the anti trust and interstate commerce acts in later official messages created no uneasi ness is evidenced by the improvement in t ie value of securities that occurred when a summary of the message reached the exchanges. President Taft's judicial temperament and the absence of all sen sationalism from the message transrmt t"<l to Congress yesterday evidently in spired business men and investors with confidence that he will not indulge in the "trust-busting" talk and attacks on "swe lien fortunes'" for which his prede cessor was distinguished. Wise and Welcome. 1'riitii tlie Philadelphia Letter. President Taft's first annual message is a wise and welcome return to the con siderate and unexciting form which was customary with most of his predecessors. The President always has the opportunity to make particular communications to Congress upon particular subjects; this formal report upon "the state of the Cnion" wh ch is presented at the open in:.' of each regular session covers too wide a range to be devoted profitably to rhetorical appeals, except upon some un usua' occasion when one subject appears of dominating importance. Mr. Taft s re turn to the more conventional type is a recognition of the restoration of normal conditions and of the readiness of Con gress and the country to proceed with t he public business with orderly dis ? retfon. Mute on Great Questions. 1 ivni i Philadelphia Inquirer. President Taft ? message is chiefly re markable for what it does not say. Whether for l*i k of time, whether be ause so many routine matters carried t e document into an undesirable length, h?- President hay left for future dis ? Mission burning issues concerning *hich i :<? country wishes enlightenment. The ??cent decision regarding the Standard Oil ?'ompanv is the most im|Hjrtant opinion 1 ''at the Supreme Court lias handed down in many a day. What is the exact at titude of the administration toward it? Then there is the interstate commerce . ommission. It is known that the Presi dent wishes to strengthen the hold of the federal government upon the railroads. I?ut in what manner.' These ;ire the uuestions which are not answered. We are told as to the Sherman anti-trust law ami the interstate commerce law that "developments in their operation call for a discussion and sonu suggestions as to amendments." So in the course of tune the Prestdrnt is to advise amend ments to both of them. For the details we shall have to wait. Not Strongly Partisan. I the Philadelphia I'rmi. I hougii th?- presidential message sent to Congress yesterday is the mes sage of a republican President to a republican Coifgress, there is scarcely | a suggestion or recommendation in it ' that does not appeal to democrats quite a s strongly as to republicans. The one issue that might be considered partisan, the tariff, was disposed of in the extra session. Partisan lines will be main tained in Congress, but they will not find in this message any vital partisan issue to divide upon, unless it is the ship subsidy issue, which always secures republican indorsement in national con ventions, but has never vet been able to hold the republicans together in its favor iu a national Congress. Let us hope that it will fare better than heretofore in the present Congress, backed as it is by President Taft's earnest indorse ment. Nineteen Killed; Fourteen Missing.
