FINANCIAL REVIEW New York, Dec. 3.—The New York Evening Sun financial review today aaid : Today's stock market was consistent ly strong but th» character and source of the buying was a matter for conjec ture. Trading was of very modest pro portions as offerings were limited. Uni der these conditions a little push crel ated considerable momentum and it was too easy to develop an exaggerated idea of the buying power. Perhaps the most telling market fac tor was the secretary of the treasury's elaboration of what the president touched on in his message to congress respecting tax revision and foreign financing. Mr. Glass' recommendations in his annual report called for lower excess profits levies and if necessary higher normal taxes. He made it clear, however, that nothing could be done along that line until it was estab lished that government expenditures were not exceeding present rates. He was explicit concerning the financing of Europe's needs. Both business men and bankers feel the handicap of the absence of a posi tive position in our foreign relations with no immediate prospect of such a position except the possibility of the senate declaring by resolution that the state of war has come to an end. This is strikingly illustrate in the foreign exchange market which again broke badly with sterling below $3.89 and new lows made in francs and lire alike, a movement probably accelerated by Secretary Glass, opposition to govern ment action to establish the exchange. !
