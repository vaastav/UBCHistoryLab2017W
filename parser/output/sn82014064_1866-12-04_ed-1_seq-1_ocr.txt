djicagfl t&ribtmc. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, ISM. THE MESSAGE, We present our readers this morning with the annual Message of the President. It is the duty of every citizen to read it. The Message, while It betrays the obstinacy of the President In his adherence to his own now utterly exploded policy, also betrays that eren that obstinacy feels rebuked by the voice of public opinion. The Message, •coming froth Andrew Johnson, is a very mild offair. The reader of his messages and speeches since the 22d of February last, will look in rain in this Message to find any of that virulent abuse of Congress for which the President has become ; notorious. The message is addressed to his fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled, aud not a body claiming tr be a Congress—but in fact a mere part of. a Congress—“hanging on the verge of the Government.” He speaks respectfully of hat branch of the Government charged by .lu Constitution with the power and duty of mpeaching him and of dismissing him from •fliee. Not that he entertains any respect i»r Congress; but like all bullies aud owards, he takes off his hat to the ren who have it In their power to punish him. Eight months ago he threaten* cl to hang Thad. Stevens. Yesterday he ad d-essed Thad. Stevens as his fellow citizen o' the House of Representatives! Three larutbs ago he told the people of Pittsburgh Hat be could not see wherein would bo the wrong of his placing a guard at the doors of tie Senate and House to compel them to ad* m.t the Representatives of the rebel States. Yesterday he mentioned nothing of the £rmxd ; he mentioned nothing of any other Congress embracing his rebel friends, but re pealed his piteous appeal to the “Rump” to open their doors to his rebel friends. It has been but a few months ago since he told tkc people that he had estimated the cost, and was satisfied ihst he could pro claim himself Dictator with the utmost case, qnistcrdny he was silent upon the Dictator* and he had no official knowledge that was any Congress in the United States the,* the Radical one to which be communi* his message. Last September he told are people of Ohio that If they re-elected a rfron-ai Congress, the election would in an internecine war, in 4-dcrn he at the head of the - and their friends would make war the friends of Congress. Iq bis tges- yesterday be bad nothing to say about Ibis internecine-war. Hu did not tell bow it was progressing, nor where it was raging. He did not tell bow many troops tbc rebels could call to the field, but tic did giro a full history of the Union army, and asked for money to maintain it. The truth is that the’ elections last fall were so helming, the pop ular verdict : o unmistakable, and the coudcaii:atl»u ol the Executive to universal, that even Andrew Johnson quailed before it. To feel and understand the full lorce of these elections, let tbc n-ader contrast Johnson’s message as It is, with what it would likely have been, had he elected a sufficient number of Copperheads lo have voutrolleu Congress. ‘While there is 210 evidence that he has the slightest regard fur the wishes of the people, ’or any purpose to carry out their expressed will any further than he can help, there is evidence of that Fubmis-ion which the culprit exhibits in the presence of the olficers of justice. It is the submission of fear—the siience which sjeks to avoid sudden vengeance; the submission •which is rendered to save life, but which ft tugs from cowardice, and not from auy X nor.iblf principle. We refer our readers to the Message itself S'"r the detail*? of the information wiiich the Trcsidcut communicates to Congress upon Rational allairs, foreign and domestic, finan cial, commercial, military and naval. The document U not 100 lung to prevent its pe rusal by every citizen having an interest in the affairs ot hi- country. A 

GOOD BEGINNING. The House of Representative? yesterday, T-y a vote of 111 to 21*, voted to repeal iho pet of iMi-, by which the President was au thorized to grant amnesty and pardon for TK’lltical offences. This action has bc-cu ren dered necessary by the President’s gross iiuuse of the pardoning power. If Congress docs uol take off the Hon's 3iide at onee, let it at least pull out hia teeth uud out his claws, and this without unnecessary delay. • TUE

ItALTiVunc, December 3 —The trouble to-day to the Insulated Telegraph Campany’a line, be tween here and Washington, which happened Just at tbe time the Wn-hlng’on agent of the United Slates and European News Association, was about to communicate to the agents of tbe Ass•« laf.cn throughout the county the fact of the reading of the message of the President to Con gress, was caused by a tree being cut tnv.vn, so •Cf at it would fall upon the wires. This occurred, aboct fifteen miles from Baltimore, and the wires' became -o twisted that communication over them was impossible b'lwccu the several agencies ot tbe Association and the Washington bureau. Great labor was required to straighten the wire*, Put tbe employes ol the insulated lines iu Bdtintorc. under direction of Manager Shinier, wore equal to the emergency. He despatched some ol Its agents to survey the Due, and by 5 o'clock this afternoon communica tion had bees return* d. Tnc line, from the stand it has taken agarest the New York monopoly, has been subjected to several outrages recently. On Thursday last one of tbe wires crossing Long Bridge, at the sotrhwcslcrn end of the City of Washington, was cut. and an entire spin (about one hundred feet) of wire taken away. This break was promptly repaired; but on the next day -all four wires were twisted together early in the morning, at the same bridge.

Some malicious scoundrel is most cer tainly the author of these dastardly raids on thU company's pjoperty, and pfiorts will be made to disco tr and punish the perpetrators.

COLFAX'S F.ITLT. FniOW-CmxtKs: Only four mouths have passed away since tbe first sesaio i if the Con gress closed, and the members whom yon now greet with such earnest aud generous wel come, returned home to give an ac count of their stewardship to (bo people, and to discuss before that tribunal Turn which there is no appeal, the greatest Issues ever I dcciacd on the battle-field to which treason In- I vltod the nation. Our heroic defenders amidst st>ot aud shell and flame, on sea as well a? on shore, had triumphantly decided that our starry , gemmed banner should never become the wind- i mg sheet of the world's best hopcs.but after t tpir conflicts and their sacrifices ft remained tor tbe people at tbe ballot-box, and the people's Representatives and Senators in these halls of legli-lation to guard the Republic, efcctnally against another rebellion, drenching the laud In blood, ana after this terrible con tori to iecon>trnct on such an enduring corner stone that * porieritv should realize to the latest salable of re valued time, that our fctHcn heroes bad not died in vain.

Thank God, In this land the people are the only rulers. Every two years they resume tbeir sov ereignty, ora by their ballot (bey make and un make Congress, ana they approve or condemn administrations. They command, and Congress and tbe President must obey. We return, then, to these balls, to carry out and enforce the de cision ot the rulers of the nation, the p'-oo'e. No tnaucan misunderstand tbeir will. Four points have been settled by them beyono controversy. Ist. That tne workjof reconstruct! m must dc Id the bands of those who bare been tbeir friends, not tbe enemies of the nation, fid. That it must be based on the granite of toy ally, and not the quicksands of disloyalty, aud that with the privileges and imuanitv of the liberty granted bv the whole cation to all people. ;td. 3bat no pcr*ons shall be frauchlecd m tbe Republic on account of tbeir race, aud yet have tla-ir rttmbcrs coonied to increase political power iu those dUfranchbing them. 4tb. That the National debt, the cost of our Na tional existence, shall be torever *acred, and that all debts or claims growing out of rebellion or breakiogof letters tbat ended it, shall be forever held unit and void, atd the people also declared as their desire and will that Congress should en force this decision of tholrs by appropriate legis , laCion. Free as these few but vital points were from every consideration of revenge or mallet, looking only as they did to public Justice and the public solely, and even more generous than just. It was certainly tohavebevncxpeced that If there was in the region of tbosc who hid-warred on the country so bitterly any love fur the Union, any sorrow for their crimes, these essential conditions would have been assented to promptly, or If not promptly a? coop as the elections had mauifesiod me nation's will: bnt on the contrary tney are spurned and scornfully neglected oy tho-o who control public opinions ana wield public opinion iu tbc Sonth. and the recent election of tbemo«t conspicuous secessionists In North Carolina, Ala bama, Arkansas, Ac., with the hos tile messages of their Governors and defiant replies rciecriuglh** Constitutional Amend ment they show that they insist on representation in Congress and the Electoral Colbros for all the four millions of their former slaves, thus according the enlarged and Increased law, making power in I ' consequence ul the rebellion, while at the same i time thcFDOt only dlsfrauehbcd them, but refuse them tbc lights and protection of dtir. nshlp by dlsgraceiul and oppressive laws, pretending to regulate labor comrade, and to punish ra- S-aicy, tedudng • those whom the na on made freemen to a snbserveney and surf doui bnt UUlc if any belter than slavery itself Wi-iie wc cannot compel them to approve I |i, e coDstllutional Amendment, our duty t*» the 1 nation, oir justice to liberty and humanity, 1s ! none the Jess the exponents of the people's will. I Wo cannot avoid thaldn’y. Indeed in line may sec the finger of Providence. Like onr fore fathers in the past few years we have bullied , better than we knew. In the first stages of the I war how willingly would an overwhelming ma ! jorlty of Uic people have voted to perpetuate ! slavery In the Republic If bomhern traitors had taken from our lips the bloody cbaltce of civil war, which they compelled us to drain to its very drees; but God willed otherwise.and at last, when every family altar bad been crimsoned with blood, aud every cemetery aud churchyatd crowd ed with craves, tbc nation rore In higher duly and rrsolvt-d In these halls that slavery should die. Then the storm cloud of war passed away; God's VOL. XX. smile shone on our banners; victory after victory Messed our gallant armies, and the crownicy tri umph was woo that gave salvation tJ the Luton and freedom to slaves.. Since then wc have been earnestly struggling for reconstruction oil t-ome enduring and loyal foundation- Stumb ling Mocks Late Impeded our progress, and when at last a mild and magnanimous proposi tion is made, embodying no coruscation, no ban ishment, no penalties of offended laws, we arc baffled by a hardening of heart against ft as in explicable as Htectmu irremovable. Does itnot seem as if again the Creator is leading os : n Ills way rather than our own, and as we turn for light does it not flash upon us that He again requires (he nation to conquer Its prejudices; that lie. to fir above us, has put all human beings under an equality before the divine law, and called them his children? He demands that wc shall nut all on an equality before the hit nun law, so that every one in the regions poi soned by the Influence of slavery and principles of treason shall be clothed with alt the rights necessary for the fullest aud surest protection ocain«t tyranny, . outrage and wrong, and cot left at the mercy of those who so lone exhibited no mercy to the Gov ernment Ihev sought to destroy. 'Jhe question naturally arises, bow can this b done ? Surrounded by thcfablett jurists and patriots, statesmen retaining here as they do, crowned with sn unparalleled endorsement. It might not be fitting to anticipate Ibelr area mi nib on these vital themes, on the session just opening, but when the Constitution declares In It« opening section that all legislative powers herein granted shall bo vested in a Con gress ol the Urltod States, when It solemnly en joins that the United States shall guarantee to every State in ih-i Union a .repub lean form of Government, and when it gives to Congress tuU authoritvto make all laws which shall be neces sary therefore for carrying Into execution all pow er? vested by thts Constitution in the Government of the United Spates or in any department or offi cer thereof, the doty and its exercise both seem to have been specifically anticipated by the framers of our supreme law. Since President Johnson declared. In 3lay, 1 8G5, that the rebellion bad destroyed all the civil government In the re bellious Sta'cs, Congress has not recognized any of the governments established under the authori ty of military law, except the rebel disfranchising government ot ihc State of Tennessee. It has yet to settle the question, under the oaths of Its members, to support and-deend the Constitu tion, whether those provincial and unrecognized governments, in which those who have een the bitterest enemies of the republic are dominant in tho ex ecutive legislature and judicial departments, where to have been a soldier of the Union, cither living or dead, is a reproach; where devotion to the lost cause of treason, openly avowed, is (ho giuuanUe of popular favor; where the colors and heroes of the rebellion arc enthusiastically hailed, and where citizenship is refused to the only people in their midst, who as a class have been been loyal, arc or aro not republican forma of government, which it Is the duty of the United States to guarantee and protect 1 caring this and kindred qiu-stioi'fl to those who will so apllv discuss them, can we not n'l here say, as loyal mid patriotic and Justice loving citizens, as for us and our children, the vow which we have given to justice and hu manity Is registered In heaven. No black lu-ve m our borders; bopltateson our strand; notral toi> In our Congress; no slave upon our land.

FEESIDESTS MESSAGE. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Rep resentatives: Atier a Brief interval, tha CoDgreaa of tho United States reenmes Its annual Icgls’alivo labors. An All Wise and Merciful Providence has •uated the pestilence, which visited oorahorea, leaving its calamitous traces upon some portions of our country. Peace,‘order, tranqmilty and civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the whole ol the United State* In ah the Slates, civil authority has superseded tho coercion ot arms, and toe people, by their voluntary action, am maintaining their Governments in fall activity and complete operation. The enforcement of the laws Is no longer obstructed in any State by combinations too powertnl to be suppressed by Ihe ordinarv coarse of Jadiciml proceedings, and the animosities, engendered by the war are rapid ly yielding to the beneficent influences of oar free institutions, and to the kindly effects of onre stneted social and commercial Intercourse. An entire restoration ol fraternal feeling moat be the earnest wish of every patriotic heart, and we will have accomplished our grandest national achieve ment when, forgetting the sad events of the past, and remembering only their instinctive lessons. we resume onr onward career as a free, prosper ous and intelligent people. restoration or the states. In my message of the 4th of December, 1865, Congress was informed of the measures which had been instituted by the Executive with a view to the grannal restoration of the States in which tho Insurrection o< carted to their relations with the General Government. Provisional Governors bad been appointed, Conventions called, Govern ors elected. Legislatures assembled, aud Senators and Representatives chosen to the Congress ol the United Stales; courts bad been opened lor the en forcement of laws long In abeyance; the blockade bad been removed-custom houses re-estab isbed, and the Internal Revenue laws put in force to order that the people might contrionte to the na tional income. Postal operations had been renewed, and efforts were being made to restore tfiem to their former condition and effi ciency. The States themselves had been asked to take pan in the high function of amending the Constitution, and of thus sanctioning the extinc tion of slavery, as one of the legitimate results of onr istcrneaDe struggle. Haring progressed thus far, the Executive Department found that it had accomplished nearly all that waa within the scope of Us constitutional authority. One thing, how ever, yet remained to be done before the work of restoration could be completed, and that was, the admission to Congress of loyai Senators and Rep resentatives from the States whose people bad re belled against the lawful authority of the General Government. This question devolved upon the respective Homes, which, by the Constitution, arc made the judges of the elections, returns and qnaliflcations ot their own members, and Its con tlderation at once engaged the attention of Con gtess. in the meantime, the Executive Depart ment—no other plan having been proposed by Congress—continued In its efforts to perfect, as far as was practicable, the restoration of the proper relations between the citizen- of the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time to time, as tbc public interests teemed to require, the judicial, revenue and postal systems of the country. With the advice and consent of the Sen ate, the necessary officers were appointed, and appropriations made by Congress for the pay ment of tbclr salaries. The proposition to amend the Federal Constitution so as to prevent the ex istence ot slavery within the United States, or any place subject to thetr Jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite number of Staten, ami on the ISm day of December, isGo. it was officially declared to have become valid as part of the Constitution of the United States. All of the States hi which the Insurrection had existed promptly amended their Constitution!*, so as to make them conform lo tbc great change thus effected in the organic Jaws of (he land; declared null and void all ordinances and laws of seces sion; repudiated all pretended debts and obliga tions created for the revolutionary purposes of insurrection, and proceeded nt good faith to the enactment of measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of tho colored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit anv of these blaterto representation, and it was not until towards the close ol the eighth month of tho ses sion that an exception was made in fhvor of Ten nessee, by the admission of her Senators and Representatives. EXCLUSION or LOTAL SOUTHERN SENATORS AND atrursEXTXTivEs. I deem It a subject of profound regret that Con gress has thus lur failed to admit to seats loval twnatori* and Kcpret-cntatives from the other Stales, whose inhabitants, with those of Ten- net-tec, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten Slates —more than uLc-iourtb of the whole number remain without representation. The scats of W members in the House of Hopresemarives. and ol £o members in the Senate, are jet vacant— not by their own consent, not by a failure of c.ectior.—but by the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, U Is be lieved, would hare accomplished much toward the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, unu removed serious cause for dis content on the port of the inhabitants of those States. It would have accorded with the great prin ciple tnutclaicd In the Declaration or American Independence, that no people ought to bear tbc burden of taxation, and yet be dented the right of representation. h would have been in consonance with the ex press pi ovision# of the constitution that each State ehal! have at least one representative, and tuat no State without its consent shah ho deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. These provisions were In tenthd lo secure to every Slate, and to the people of every. State the right of representation tn each House of Congress, and eo important was u deemed by the framers of the Constitution that the equably of the States !n the Senate should be preserved, that cot even by an amendment of the l oi.stitntion enu any State, wilbont Us consent, bo denied a voice lu that branch of tbc national legislature. IXTZOIUTT or AIL TOC STATES. It Is true it bos been assumed that the existence of the States was terminated by tbe rebellions act* ol their Inhabitants, nod that the Insurrection having been suppressed they were thenceforward to be considered merely os conquered territories. The legislative, executive ana judicial depart ments of the Government have, however, with ;real distinctness and uniform coasts i-ccy refuted to sanction an as sumption so Incompatible with the nature cl our republican system, anil the pro filed objects of the war. Throughout ihc recent legislation of Congress the nudciuablc fact makes Itself apparent, that tbe ten political communities arc nothing less than Staton ol this Union. At the very commencement of the rebellion, each house declared with a unanimity as remarkable as it was significant, that tbe war was not “waged upon our part In any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, our pur pose of overthrowing or iiitcrfrrhip with the rights or established Institutions of tho*e Stales; bnl to difcnd and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance theicof; audio preserve tbe Union with all the dignity, equality and lights of the several Mites unimpaired; and that as soon as these ©ejects wote accomplished, the war ought to cease.” la route instances, Senators were per mitted to continue their legi-lattvo fnnct'ons, while in other instances. U-preseutallves were tiecird and auu.!tii*d to scats alter tney bad form ally declared their right to withdraw from tbe Union, and wcic endeavoring to maintain that right by force of arms. All the Slates (whoso people were in insurrec tion, us States were included in the apportion ment of the direct tax of s2o.ono.oi'o annnullv laid upon the people of tbet United states by the act approved stb August, IH3I. Congress, by the act ot .Varch 4th, 1M.9, and by the apportionment of representation (thereunder, also recognized their }>rcfCLccoa States in tnc Union, and they have, or judicial purposes, been divided into district* as States alone can bo divided. The same recog nition appears In the rcccutlegtslation lu reference to loMietsec. which evidently rests upon the fact that the functions of the Slate were not destroyed by the rebellion, but merely suspended, and that the principle is of coorscgapplicable to those Mates which, like Tennessee, attempted to renounce their places in the Union. The action of the Executive Department of tbe Government upon this subject has been equally definite and uniform, and the purpose of the war was specifi cally amted iu the proclamation Issued by my pre decessor on tbe 23a day of September, irei, it was (ben solemnly proclaimed and declared that here alter, as heretofore, tbe war will be prosecuted for the object of practically restoring the consti tutional relations between the United Stare* and each of the Mates, and .the people thereof in w hich States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed. The recognition of the States by tbe'Judicial Department of the Government has al*o been clear and conclusive in oil affecting them ns States, and in the Supreme, Circuit ana DUUlct Courts. S.'AuncATioKS or VniBCIH. mission of Senators and Keprcscnta tives from any and all of the States there can be no just cronml of apprehension that persons who arc disloyal will bo clothed with the powers of legislation; for this could not happen wben the Constitution and the laws ore enforced by a vit-Boni and faithful Congress. Each boose is made the judge of tbe elections, returns and nnallficatlons oi its own members, and may. with the .concurrence of two-thhds. expel a member. When a Senator or Representa tive presents bis certificate of election, be may at once be admitted or rejected; or. should there be any question as to bis cligibllliv. bis credentials m»y oe referred for in vestigation to tbe appropriate committee. If ad mitted to a scat, it must be upon evidence sa ls factory to th** bouse ofwblcb he then become* a member, that he possesrc* tbe requisite constitu tions! and legal qualifications. If rcftised admis sion as a member for want of due allegiance to tbe Government, and returned to Ms couslitnect*, rST arc admonished that none but {tenons loyal to rite United States will be allowed a voice in the legislative councils of the nation, and tbe political power nod moral influence of Congress are thus eSectively exerted in the Inter ests of loyally to the Government and fidelity to tbe Union. Upon this question, so vitally affecting the restoration of tbe Union and the permanency of our present former govontm<nt my conviction* heretofore expressed, bare undergone no change; but on the conn ary. correctness bas been confirmed by reflection and time, if the admission of loyal members to tbeir seals in tbe respective boose* of Congress was wise and expedient a yearago.it is no- leva wise and expedient now. If this anrmalous«ondition is right now; tf in the ex act condition ol these Mates at the present time it is lawful to exclude them fr.vm representation, 1 do not sec that the question wit) be chanced by the influence of time. Ten rears hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will be no strong er ; the right of exclusion will be no weaker. 

XDTAXTXOK OT AXHtITTIKO LOTAL 80VTMK5 XZX< OCRS. - Tbe Constitution of the United States makesit the duly oi the President to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall Judge necessary or expedient. 1 know of no measure more lucratively demanded hr every consideration of nation'll interest, sound policy and equal Justice, than the admission of the loyal members from the cow unrepresented States, This would consummate the work, of restoration, and exert a most sain* ta<y influence la the establishment of peace, harmony ana fraternal feeling. It would tend greatly to renew the confidence of the American people in the vigor and stability of their Institu tions. it would bind u» mere closely together as a nation, and enable ns to show the world the in herent and recuperative power of a Gorcrnmeut founded upon the will of the people, and estah li«bcd upon the principles of liberty, justice and Intelligence. Our increased strength and enhtno'd prosper .tv would inefragably demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free Institutions, drawn from our teccnl national disorders, by the enemies of republican government. The admission of loyal members (ram the btatrs now excluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital now awattmc an opportunity for investment into the channel* of trade and inanslry. It would alleviate the present troubled condition of those States, j ftl ,d by inducing Inslgrantt, aid to the settlement of fertile regions now uncultivated, and lead to an Increased production of those staples which have added so ranch to the wealth of the naticn. and the commerce of the world.

In thus attempting to make our General Government strong we make it weak.

The report of the Secretary of the Treasury af fords much information respecting the revenue and commerce of the country, Elis views upon the cnrrenCT, and with reference to a proper ad justment of onr revenue system, internal as well as impost, are commended to the careful conside ration of Congress. In my last annual message I expre teed my general views upon these subject. I n?td now only call attention to the necessity of carrying Into every department of the Govern ment a system of rigid accountability, thorough retrenchment find wise economy, with no ex ceptional or unusual expenditures, the oppres sive burdens ot -taxation can be lessened by such a modification of onr revenue laws as wilt be con- usiecl with the public faith attd the legitimate and necessary wants of the Government. The report presents a mnch more satis'actory condition of our finances than one year ago the most sansnlce coo id have anticipated. Coring the fiscal year ending Jane 30th, 1865, the last year of the war, the pnblic debt wa« increased StMI,9Q2 537, and on the 31st of October, 1565, it amonnted to 13,710,-51,750.

Jn tnc last annual report on the state of finances, it Tins estimated that during the three quarters of the fiscal year ending tbe 50th of Jane last, the debt would be increased $'12,101,017. During that period, however, it was reduced $ >1,106.337, tbe receipts or the year having been $39,995,995 mote, ana tbe expenditures $£00,389;2J3 less than the estimate:* Nothing could more clearly indicate than these statements tbe extent end availability of the na tional resources, and the rapidity and safety w ith which, under our form of cut eminent, great military and naval establishments can be disband ed, ana expenses reduced Irum a war to a peace footinc.

BECHETAUY OP WAB. The report of the Secretary of War furnishes Valuable and important information in reference to the operation of his department during tbe past year. Few volunteers now remain In ’he service, and they arc being discharged as rapidly as they van bo replaced by regular troops. Tbe army has been promptly paid, careiully provided with medical treatment, well sheltered and subsisted, and ia to be furnished with brecch-ioading small arms. The military strength of the nation has bran unim paired uy the discharge of volunteers, the dispo sition ot unserviceable or perishable stores, and the tctrencLmeiit of expenditures. Sufficient war mat dial to meet any emergency baa been retained, and from the discarded volunteers, standing ready to respond to the national call, large armies can be rapidly organized, equipped and concen trated. The fortifications on the coast and fron tier have received, or arc being prepared for, more powerful armaments: lake surveys and harbor and river improvements are in course of energetic prosecution. Preparations have been made fur payment of tbe additional bounties authorized during the recent session of Congress, under snch regulations as will protect the Government from fraud and secure to the honorably discharged sol dier tbe well-earned reward of his faithfulness and gallantry. More than 6,000 maimed soldiers have received artificial limbs, or other serviceable apparatus; forty-one National *'emeteric*. containing the re mains of 101,526 Union soldiers, have already been established. Tbe total estimate of military Appropriations is $25,205,609. report or the secretary op tub satt. 11 ib stated In the report of the Secretary of the Navy that tbe ( aval force at this lime consists of 278 vessel?, armed with 2,351 gun?. Of these, 115 vessel?, carrying 1.029 cans, ate in commission, dist-lbnUd chlcuy among seven squadrons. Tne number of men in the service is 13/-00. Great ac- tltiiy and vigilance have been displayed by all the squadron?, and their movements have been ju diciously and efficiently arranged iu such a manner as would best promote American commerce, and protect tbe rights and interests of our countrymen abroad. The vessels unemployed arc undergoing r« pairs, or arc laid up until their services may be tequhed. Most of the iron-clad fleet is at I.eague Island, in tbe vicini y of Philadelphia, a place which, until deci-ive action should hetakcirby Congress, was selected by the Secretary of the Navy as ibe most eligible location for that class of vessels. It Is important that a suitable pnblic station should be provided for the iron-clad fleet. It i- intended that these vessels shall be in pro per condition for any emergency, and It 1? desir able that the hill accepting League island for naval purposes, which passed the House of Rep lescntstlvos last session, should receive final action at an early period, in order that there may be a •■ullablo public station for this cla*s of ves- sels, as well a? a navy yard of area sufficient for the wants of the service on the Delaware River. The naval pension fund amounts to $11,759,000, bating been increased $2,.00.000 during the year. The expenditnres of the Department for the fiscal year ending 30th Jane last, were $43,321,526, and the estimates for tbo coming year amount to $24,568,436. Attention is invited to the condition of onr sea men. and tbe importance of legislative measures for their relief and improvement. This sugges tion on behalf of this deserving class of onr M low.duzcns. Is earnestly recommended to tho tavotable attention of Congress. DEPORT OP THE POSTMASTER GENERAL. The report of tbo Postmaster General presents a most satisfactory condition of tbe postal service, ana submit? recommendation? which deserve the .consideration of Congress. The revenues of the Department for the year ending June 39. were $14,386,986, and the expenditures $15.352,079, showing an increase of the latter of $1413,093. In anticipation of this deficiency, however, a special appropriation was made by Con gress m the act approved July 23, is*6. Including the standing appropriation of $700,01X1 for free mail matter, os a legitimate portion of the revenues yet remaining unexpend ed, the actual deficiency fur tbe past year is only fSts.ot'3. a sum within $15,141 of the amount e-U --mated in the annual report of Tbe decrease of revenue compared with the previous year, was one and one-flttn per cent, and tbe increase of ex penditures. owing principally to the enlargement of tbe mall service in the South, was tweivc per cent On the •‘ > olh ot Jnnc test there were in operation R.tcii mail routes, with an aggregate length of lSP.f2t miles; an aggregate annual transportation of 71,837,914 miles, trd an aggregate annual cost. Including ail expenditures,* of fe.tliUSt. The length ot railroad routes is 33.032 miles, and tbe annual transportation 30,W8.4ii7 miles. The length of steamboat routes is 14.340 miles, audtbeanuual transportation 3,411,1413 miles. Tbe mail service is rapidly increasing through out the whole country, and its etcauy extension in (he Southern States indicates (heir constantly improving condition. The growing importance of the foreign service also merit* attention. Tbe Post Office Department of Great Britain and our own have agreed upon a preliminary basis fora new postal convention, which, Hie believed, "ill prove eminently benefi cial to tbe commercial Interests of tbe United States, as St contemplates a reduction of tbe international lefcr postage to one-hall ibe ex isting rates. A reduction ot postage with ail other counules, to and from which correspondence is ttanamitted in the British mall, or in closed nulls, •.brooch the United Kingdom, the establishment of uniform and reasonable charges for these and territorial transit of com>pondcuce in closed mails, and an allowance to each Post Office Depart ment of the rtcht to nee all mail communications established under the authority of tbe other, for the despatch or correspondence, either in open or closed mails, on tbe same terms as those applica ble lo the inhabitant* of the country providing the means of transmission. nzTOBTor-mx srennanr or tux xxrsmon. The report of the Secretary of the Interior ex hibits the condition of those branches of the pub lic service which are committed to bis supervision. Dunns the i»ft fiscal year, acres of pub lic 1010 were disposed of: LSVOlti acres were enUred under the Uomcsiead Act. The policy orirlnallT adopted relative to the public lauds has undergone essential modifications. Immediate revenue, and not their rapid fclt'cment was the cardinal feature of our land system.

Its propi tious rosolts are undoubted, and will be more signally manifested when time shall have given to ir a wider development. Congress has made liberal grants of public land to corporations in a d of tue construction ot railroads and other internal improvements. Should this policy heie after prevail, more stringent provisions will be required to secure a faithful application of the fund. The title tu the land should not pass by patent or otherwise, hot remain in the Govern ment, and subject to Us contra l.umfl some por tion of the road ha* been actually built. Portions ot them might then, from lime 10 time, be con veyed to the corporation; but never to a greater ratio to the whole quantity embraced by the grant than the completed parts bear to the entire iefigth o! the projected improvement. This restriction would not operate to the prejudice of any under taking conducted In good null.and executed with reasonable energy. As it lathe sealed practice to withdraw- f:om market the lands tailing within the operation of such grants, and thus to exclude the Inception uf a subsequent adverse right—a breach oi the conditions which Congress may deem proper to impose should work a foifeltnre of claim to the lands so withdrawn, hut unconveyed, and of UUc to the Ui coL'eyed which ie-i aiu unsold.

The Dial rid of Colombia, under existing laws, is nut entitled to that representation in me Na tional Connell which, from onr earliest history, has been uniformly accorded to each Territory es tablished from time to time withm onr limits. 11 maintains peculiar relations to Congress, to vhom the Constitution has gi anted the power of exercising exclusive legislation over the District. Oar fellow-citizens residing iu the District, whose Interests are thus confided to the special guardian ship of Congress, exceed In number the popula tion of several o: onr Territories, and no Just rea eon is perceived why a delegate of their choice should nut be admiued to a seat in the House of Ifcpresentatives. No mode seems so appropriate and effectual of enabling them to make known thdr peculiar condition and wants, and of secur ing the local legislation adapted to them. I, therefore, recommend tbe passage of a law au thorizing the electors of tho District of Columbia to choose a Delegate, to bo allowed the same rigU's and privileges as a Delegate representing a lerritoiy. Tbe increasing enterprise and rapid {iroeress of improvement in the District, are hich y gratifying, and 1 trust that the efforts of the municipal authorities, to promote the prosperity oi tho National Metropolis, will receive the effi cient and gencrom co-operation of Congress. aoiuccTTmc.

INTERNATIONAL TELECnAPn. The entire success of the Atlantic telegraph, between the coast of Ireland and tbo Province of Newfoundlai d. Is an achievement which has been . uslly celeb* ated in bulb hemispheres a* tbe open ng of an era In tbe progress of civilization. 1 hero Is reason to expect that equal success will aticod, and«ven greater results lollow, tbe enterprise tor connecting the two comments through the Pacific Ocean, by the projected lino of telegraph between Kamscbatka and the Russian Possessions in America. VAntocs subjects. The icsolution of Congress protesting against patdont by fotclgu Governments of persons con victed of infamous offences, on condition of cai 'ration to oar country, has been communicated to the Stales with which we maintain intercourse, and tbe practice, so justly the subject of complaint on our patt, has not been renewed. Tbe congratulations ot Congress to the Emperor of Russia upon his escape from attempted assas sination, have been presented to Hut humane and enlightened taler, and received by him with ex pifer-lons of grateful apmcciatlon. The Executive, warned of an attempt by Span ish American advcuturcis to Induce the emigra tion of Irecdraen of the Unite I States to a foreign country, protected against the project ns one which. If consummated, would reduce them to a bondage oven more oppressive than that from which they have just been relieved. Assurances have just been received from tho Government of tbe State in which the plan was matured that the proceeding will meet neither it? encouragement nor approval. It is a question worthy of vjnr consideration whether our laws upon this subject are adequate to the prevention or punishment of the crime thus meditated. Tim Mexican question. Jn tbe moi th of April lost, as Congress is aware, a friendly anngement was made between the Em peror of the Fitncb and the ITesidcnt of the Uni ted States, fortbe withdrawal from Mexico of the French expeditionary military forces. The with drawal wa s to be made in time detachments, the first cf which it was understood would leave Mex ico in November now past: tbe second In March ncxl, and the thim and last in November, 1-67. Immediately upon the completion of the evacua tion, the French Government was to assume the sumo attitude of ntu-intervcutiou in regard to Mexico ce is held by Ihe Government of the United States. Repeated assuranc e have been given by the Emperor since that agreement that be would com plete the piom.eui evacuation within the period mentioned or sooner. Itwa? reasonably expected that tbe proceedings thus contomplaUd would Produce a crisis of great political interest In the icpullic of Mexico. The newly appointed Min ister of tbe United States, Mr. Campbell, was, therefore, seutorward on the ninth day of Novem ber last to assume his proper lunctions as Minis ter Plenipotentiary of the United States to that Republic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by tbe Lieutenant General of the army of tbe United Slaic?,wlihavicw ofobtainlngsncb information as might be important to determine the coarse to be purrucd by the United States in re-establishing and maintaining necessary and proper Intercourse with Uit- Republic of Mexico. Deeply interested in the came of liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duly on our part to exercise whatever influence we professed for the restoration and permanent establishment in that country of a do mestic and republican form of government. Stub was ihe condition of affirrs In regard to Mexico. whim, on thu 22d ot November last, official Information was received from Pans that the Emperor of France had. some time before, decided not to withdraw a detachment of bis forces in Ihe month of Novem ber past, according to engagement, but that this decision was made with the purpose of withdraw ing the whole of (hose forces In the ensuing spring. Of this dctfimlnalion, however, the Uni ted States had not received any notice or intima tion. and as soon as Ibe information was received by the Government, care was taken to make known Its dissect to the course of the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the hope that France will reconsider tbo subject, and adopt some reso lution in regard to the evacuation of Mexico, which will conform as nearly as practica ble with the existing engagement, and thus meet the Ju-l expectations of the Coiled States. The papers relating to the subject will be laid before you. It is believed that with the evacuation of Mexico by thu expeditionary forces, no subjtct for seriona dliTercnce? between France and the United States would remain. The expressions ot the Emperor andpeople of Prance warrant a hope that the traditionary friendship iKtwt-en the two coumrie* might, in that case, be renewed and permanently restored. A claim of a citizen of the United States for in demnity for spoliations commuted on the high seas by the Ficnch authorities, In tbo exercise of a belligerent power agdnst Mex ico, has becu mot by the Government of France with a proposition to defer scltlcmentuntll a mutual convention fortbe ad justment of all claims of citizens and subjects of Doth countries, arising out of the recent wars on this Contituni, shall be agreed upon by ibe two countries. The suggestion Is lc. deemed unrea sonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner In which claims for indemnity by for eigners, os well as citizens of the United States, arising ont of the late civil war, shall b.* adjudi cated and determined. 1 have no donot that the subject of ait surh claims will engage your atten tion at & couvcnfTnt aud proper lime. It is a matter oi great regret that no considera ble advance has been made towards an adjustment of Ibe ibfierencc* between the United States and Great Britain, arising out of ibe depredations on our national commerce, and other trespasser, commuted during onr civil war, by British sub jects. In violan* n of International law and treaty obligations. The delay, how ever, may be believed to have resulted, in n*> sc all degree, hom the do mestic sfualion of Great Britain. An en tire change of ministry occurred in that country during the !a*t session of Pan lament The atiei lion ol them-wmiuhtry was called to the subject at an early day, and there is some reason to expect that it wilt now be considered In a be coming and Irivtidly spirit. The importance of an early disposition of the question cannot be exag geraud. Whatever uilgtt be the wishes of the two Governments, it is manifest that goodwill and friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a ledproclty in tbe practice of good faith and neutrality shall bo restored be tween the respective nations. the rniAS cerastes or caxana. On the ttb of Jane las*, in violation of onrnen* traliiT bwg. s din. - ry cn.erprisc against the Brit ish Nor.h American Colonies was projected and attempted to be carri-d on within the territory and jurisdiction of tue UnLed Ssatcs. In obedl tnre to the obligation imposed upon th" Executive br the Constitution, to see that the laws arc faith full* executed, all citizens were warned, by proc lamation, against Union past in or aiding such unlawful proceedings, and the proper civil, mili tary and naval officers v ere directed to take all mrretarv measures for the enforcement of the liitf. The expedition failed, but It has not beets without Its painful consequences. Some of our citizens? who, it was allefi**o, were engaged la the expedition, were captured. and have been brought to trial, as for a capital offence, in the Province of Canada. Judgment and sentence of death have been pronounced agalnstsome, while others hare : ban acquired. Folly believing in the maxim 01 government that severity of civil punishment lor misguided persons, who have engaged in revolu tionary attempts, which have disastrously failed, is unsound and unwise, such representaUuns have been made to the Brit : sh Government in behalf of the convicted persons, as. being sustained by an enlightened and humane Judgment, will.

NATUfIAUEITIOX. The Govern matt has claimed for ail persona not convicted, or accused, or suspected ot crime, an absolute political right of self-expatriation and a choice of new national allegiance. Most of tho European Stales have dlssenlad from this princi ple, and have claimed a right to hold scch of their subjects as have immigrated to and been natural ized in the United States, and afterwards returned on transient visits to their native conn tries, to the performance of military serv ice, in like manner as resident subjects. Complaints arising from tha claim In this respect made by foreign States, have here tofore been masters of controversy between the United States and some of the European powers, and the irritation consequent upon the fsUnre to settle this question increased during the warm which Italy. Prussia and Austria were recently engaged. While Grcatßntaln nos neveracknow- lodged (he right of expatriation, she-has net for some past practically insisted on the opposite doctrine. France has been equally forbearing, and Prussia has proposed a compro mise which, although evincing increased liber ality, has not been accepted by the United States. Peace is now prevailing everywhere in Europe, and the present seems to oe a favorable time (or an assertion by Congress of the principle so long, maintained by ibe Executive Department, tiuvt naturalixatioc bv one Stare folly exempts tho na tive bom subject of any other State from the per formance of military service under soy foreign Government, so long as he does not voluntarily renounce Us rights and benefits. 

CONCLUSION. In the performance of a duty imposed upon me by tbe Constitution, 1 have thns submitted to the representatives of the bialcs and of tbc people such miormation of our domestic- sod foreign af fairs as the public Interests seem to-require. Our Government is now undergoing its most trying oideal, and my earnest prayer is-that toe peril may tie successfully and finally passed with out impairing Us anginal strength and symmetry. The interests of the nation are best promoted by the* revival of fraternal relatione, the complete obliteration of our past differences, and tho rclnan?nration of all tbe pursuits of peace. Directing nor efions to the early accomplishment of these great ends,, let ns endeavor to preserve harmony between the co otdlnstc departments of the Government, that each In its proper sphere may cordially co-operate with the other in securing tho maintenance of the Constitution, tbs preservation of the Union, and the peipctulty ofonp free institutions.
