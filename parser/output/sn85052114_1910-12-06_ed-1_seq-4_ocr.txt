fearful indictment of the police court county court and circuit court on the front page of the News Democrat this morning In which it showed that in eight murder cases since last February In SlcCracken county one was acquitted in police co hrt1twoycro acquitted In circuit court two were admitted to ban l and two havo not been apprehended and not one has been convicted Only one of the crime in which no arrest has been made was committed in Paducah the other the Pool ro d murder was committed In the county and so far as We can ascertain the prosecuting officiate have taken no interest In tho case The other mur der that of Frank McManus way committed In the city and the police havo been working on the case 00 fur without apparent success or all the murders recorded in this mornings NewsDemocrat only one the Pool road mystery of the county was committed in the furtheranco of robbery The others wore com mitted In hot blood or for re rouge The police cannot prevent such crimes Tooonly possible prevention of them Is a speedy and complete justice meter out in such fashion us to engender respect for the taw That Justice can be s redonly through tho cooperation of the pros ecuting officials with the police and prompt execution of tho courts mandates ThereIS no charge made in the NewsDemocrat that the police did not promptly arrest these people The statement Is that they were admitted to ball and that they were acquitted on trial theyI I Unpunished murder unrestrained prostitution contempt for the laws of God and man are the crying evils of Paducah and McCracken county as our morning contemporary truly infers but It will have tolook higher than tho police department for the blame blameA n A MARVELOUS RECORD Tbo Interest which attaches to a Taft message is not the same we felt in those of Roosevelt Under tho preceding administration we antic jwted with keen relish personal allu sions provocative of sharp retort and some now direction given to tho presidential zeal Nothing of tho kind Is looked for In a communica tion from President Taft Wo spoke of Roosc Its policies If We should write Tafts 11 nine readers out of tenj without a mo merits hesitation would supply the letters rogram The Taft program was outlined In hIs speeches during the campaign and reiterated In his first message to congress Ho has held ttcadfatly to It over since though reducing his demands on tho last congress to five urgent reforms namely the maxi mum and minimum schedules pub publicity licity of corporate books tariff com mission extension of the Interstate commerce commissions powers and the creation of a commerce court of review IIlI his message delivered today to congress ho repeats the part of hit program aa yet not enacted but does not elaborate on It Consequently public Intorcct Is not whetted by expectation of what Taft will advocate next and demand of congress Its his stewardship In which we aro Interested and we are not disappointed Never posing as a monitor or dictator of congress President Taft devotes the greater part of his message to reporting to congress as composed of the ropro lien tlve of the people what he has peoplemet done since last lt < met and a right good account he has given of him self Other presidents have spent tholr time more continuously at their desk In the white house but when wo road President Tafts message submitted w congress today we wonder what the were doing all that time for ho has reorganized the executive depart ment combining duties eliminating rxmfiiotlng responsibilities weeding out useless employes reducing ox penses millions and Improving the efficiency and order of all tho de partments He has recovered through the treasury department millions of dollars of which the government was defrauded Jn > customs under his pre decessors and adopted a system whereby future frauds will bo pro vented he has eat In motion the do partment of justice so that all sorts of swindle and get rJc quick Cpiwrnf > are debarred from dpuntry pjjjrjjjjjjjjs vIde operation and security of banks s enhanced and more antitrust ults are In process of prosecution ban all his predecessors together ould show Ho reports that tho rev muos of tho country will meet the xpenses besides almost taking care Ir > the fortification of tho Panama anal and for once the postofllco de flrtment will show a balance In toad of n deficit while actually ox ending Its utcfullncss and convcn ences to the public This later marvel reflects great redlt on the administration of Frank r Hitchcock postmaster general vho served as assistant to Oortclyou nd demonstrates the advantage of export t experienced men In charge of lepartmente When promotion for + fllclency Is adopted In the poetofllct had treasury departments and the orelfin service the United States will et value received for tho money ex tended Mr TaftS recommendations In stead of being backed by tho logic of yllogltms Is backed by the logloof lomonstratlon He entered the white Mouse with certain specific reforms n mind his program and he has stuck to them Ho saw that the tar t could not be equitably established by tho prevalent system of barter ind trade between states and con rcsslonal districts so ho secured ii oramlslon of exports to collect data for congress to act upon wisely eon ludlng that the average congress man Is perhaps as honest as tho average man who sends him there ind thet with tho facts before them they will not only be Inclined to do right but will be compelled to do eo by the force of a public opinion which alto will havo tho facts before It Olr Tafts success In the adminis tration of governmental affairs AS Succinctly set forth In his message and his recommendations for further enactments in line with bis pro gram compose the best answer to the fanatical arraignment of our govern ment and institutions and the strongest argument in favor of the fundamental principles of the Amer tan Union that could be formulated No man who believes graft corrup lion and injustice aro Inherent In our system of government can be fair unless ho reads President Tafts mos sage It speaks for itself that the wrongs arise not so much from nat ural depravity of man or the Inher ent defects of our eystom but from mismanagement of that system Ho Is showing us that practical common sense applied to tho administration of government and Jurtlco and or der and system are more effective In promoting the common welfare than denunciation of conditions tho pict uring an ideal existence and a do mand for untried experimentation Those who ask for tho substitu ton of some new form of govern ment we bid wait and see what can be accomplished under tho proper ad ministration of those functions wo i possess President Taft has visited i every section whose laws ho exe cutes Inspected every public enter prise concerning which ho makes recommendations travolcd to every court with which the state depart ment deals and ho knows at first hand what IS needed and how beAt admnletcred Before writing bis message ho Inspected the immigrant receiving station at New York and the Panama canal and he says the one should not be enlarged to en courage further landing there and that tho canal caveIn Is not so seri cue as reported bIgbUllncs business concern we should expect him to acquaint himself with the physical properties of tho concern tho source of its supply the means of transportation to the market the demands of the trade and tho condi tions of the market President Taft has adopted the came Idea Into the administration of government wIth wonderful results He entered office at tho conclusion of a panic with > revenues below ro ceipts the departments in chaos and I the postal deficit becoming enormous At the close of three years ho re ports public works progressing eco nomically and rapidly the revenues exceeding the expenditures the post office department with a balance the treasury department stopping leaks the department of Justice enforcing the laws our foreign relations sat isfactory and American capital get ting a foothold In Latin America and the orient where our trade must be expanded and ho recommends prac tical common sense legislation with regard to the Improvement of water ways reclamation and forestry service the protection of tho Panama canal and tho extension of American trade Those parlor scholars whose re searches consist of the denatured kind ot science written in novelised form and entertaining style and those students of public affairs who

psychology history and art or any old Uilrjg In wm Jlently striking style to appeal to the jaded appetites of habitual fiction readers will not find President Taft report of what ho has done very en tertaining but the real student of affairs accustomed to digesting coarse mental food who takes a gen uine Interest In his country and Its statesmen will find much substance for thought by readng President Hafts campaign speeches and his first message to congress setting forth his alms and purposes and this last message detailing what too has accomplished x 

PRESIDENT TAFTS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS I Continued from Pago Ono Pence Commission Appreciating these enlightened tend encies of modern times the congress at Its last session passed a law provid ing for tho appointment of a commls lion of five members to bo appointed by the president of tho United States to consider tjjo expediency of utilizing existing International agencies for tho purpose of limiting the armaments of the nations of the world by 11ut rnatlon al I agreement and of constituting the combined navies of tho world au inter national force for tho preservation of universal peace and to consider and report upon any other means to dimm ish the expenditures of government for military purposes and to lessen tho probabilities of war ITho I work of tho international fish eries commission appointed In 1003 under the treaty of April 11 

IOCS be tween Great Britain and the United States has resulted In tho formula ton and recommendation of uniform regulations governing the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and the United States for the purpose of protecting and increasing tho supply of food fish in such waters The Far East The center of Interest in far eastern affairs during tho past year has again been China It Is gratifying to note that the ne gotiations for a loan to the Chinese government for tho construction of the trunk railway lines from Ilaukow southward to Canton and westward through the Tangtso valley known as the Ilukuang loan were concluded by the representatives of tho various financial groups in May last and tho i results approved by their respective I governments governmentsTariff Tariff Negotiations The new tariff law in section 2 re specting tho maximum and minimum tariffs of the United States which pro visions came into effect on April 1 1010 Imposed upon the president the responsibility of determining prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against tho United States and its products in any I country of tho world with which wo I sustained commercial relations Tho policy of broader and closer trade relations with the Dominion of Canada which was initiated in the ad justment of the maximum and mini mum provisions of the tariff act of August 1009 has proved mutually ben eficial It justifies further effort for the readjustment of the commercial relations of the two countries BO that their commerce may follow the chan nels natural to contiguous countrIes and bo commensurate with the steady expansion of trade and Industry on both sides of tho boundary line Tho Department of State All tariff negotiations so Vital to our commerce and Industry and the duty of jealously guarding tho equitable and < just treatment of our products capital and industry abroad devolve upon the department of state The efforts of that department to se cure for citizens of the United States equal opportunities in the markets of the world and to expand America commerce have been most successful The volume of business obtained In I now fields of competition and upon new lines Is already very great and < congress Is urged to continue to sup port the department of state In its en deavors for further trade expansion An instrumentality Indispensable to the unhampered and natural develop ment of American commerce Is mer chant marine All maritime and com mercial nations recognize the impor tanco of this factor The greatest com mercial nations our competitors jeal ously foster their merchant marine I alluded to this most Important sub ject in my last annual message It has often been before you and I need pot recapitulate tho reasons for Its recom mendation Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great com mercial nation unable to avail In Inter national maritime business of this great contribution to the means of the world commercial Intercourse For many reasons I cannot too strong I ly > urge upon the congress the passage of a measure by mall subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee tho establishment and rapid development of an American merchant marine the restoration of the American flag to its ancient place upon the seas Estimates For Next Year Expenses Tho final estimates for the year end ing Juno 30 1912 as they have been sent to tho treasury on Nov 29 of this year for the ordinary expenses of the government including those for pub lic buildings rivers and harbors und the nary building program amount to 03049101312 This is 3200188730 less than tbo appropriations for tho fiscal year ending Juno 30 lOlL It is 10SS315314 less than tho total call mates including suplcmcntal esti mates submitted to congress by the treasury for tho yer 1011 and is 5 C74CS939 less than tho original esti mates submitted by the treasury for 1011Thcso These figures do not include the ap propriations for tho Panama canal tho policy in respect to which ought to bo I and is to spend as much each year as I can bo economically and ixjjctlvely ex pended in order to compltvv the canal as promptly as possible and there fore the ordinary motive for cutting down the expense of tho government does not apply to appropriations for this purpose It will bo holed that the estimates for the Panama canal for tho ensuing year ore more than uO > 000000 an increase of 20000000 over tho amount appropriated for this year a difference due to tho fact that tho estimates for 1012 include some thing over 10000000 tor the fortifica tion of tho canal gainst tho jestlmateij of jjxpend If J lures l

for the Panama canal which are 30020 S47C9 and Which will ultimately bo paid In bonds it will leave a deficit I for the next year of about 7000000 It congress shall conclude to fortify tho 1 canal Tho cost of the fortifications Is about 10000000 Should there be no appropriations this year for fortifi cations then there would be even in eluding the Panama canal appropria tion a surplus of about 12000000 It is not essential to the preventing of smuggling that customs districts should bo increased in number The violation of the customs laws can bo quite as easily prevented and much I more economically by the revenue cut ter service and by tho use of tho spa chit agent traveling forco ot the treas ury department Very great improvements have been rondo in respect to tho mints and as say offices Diminished appropriations have been asked for those whoso con tinuance is unnecessary and this years estimate of expenses Is 320000 less than two years ago In the bureau of engraving and printing great economics have been effected Useless divisions have been abolished with the result of saving 110000 this year In the total ex penses of tho bureau despite increased I business IAs I Revenues I As the treasury department is tho lone I I I lono through which tho income of thoI I government is collected and its expend itures arc disbursed this seems a proper place to consider the operation of tho existing tariff bill which be came a law Aug 0 1000 As en In come producing measure the existing I tariff bill has never been exceeded by I any customs bill in the history of tho I I country The corporation excise tar proper tloned to the net Income of every busi I ness corporation in tho country has worked well The tax has been easily I collected Its prompt payment Indl cates that tho Incidence of the tax has I not been heavy It offers hnsI I Ian I opportunity for knowledge by tho government of the general condition land I I business of all corporations and that means byfar the moat Important I part of the business of the country In I tho original act provision was made I for the publication of returns madeI I I provision was subsequently amended by congress and tho matter left to the regulation of the president I have di rected the issue of the needed regula tions and have mode it possible for tho public generally to know from an ex amination ofvibtoTVcOTdtno returns of all corporations the stock of which IsI t I listed on any public stock exchange or is offered for sale to tho general pub lic by advertisement or otherwise The returns of those corporations whose whosefar stock is not so listed or offered far sale are directed to be open to tho In spection and examination of creditors and stockholders of the corporation whoso record Is sought Tho returns of all corporations are subject to tho Inspection of any government officer or to tho examination of any court In which the return made by the corpora tion is relevant and competent evi dence edidence The Payne Tariff Act The schedules of tho rates of duty in tho Payne tariff act have been subjected subI jected to a great deal of criticism I I some of it just more of It unfounded I and to much misrepresentation Tbo act was adopted in pursuance of n declaration by the party which Is re sponsible for It that a customs bill should be a tariff for tho protection of home Industries the measure of the protection to be the difference between tho cost of producing the Imported ar ticle abroad and tho cost of producing It at home together with such addi lion to that difference as might give a reasonable profit to the home pro i ducer The basis for the criticism of this tariff is that in respect to a number of the schedules the declared measure was not followed but < a higher differ ence retained or inserted by way of undue discrimination in favor ofcccr lain Industries and manufactures Little if any of the criticism of tho tariff has been directed against the protective principle above stated but the main body of the criticism has been based on the charge that the attempt to conform to the measure of protec tion was not honestly and sincerely ad hered to Tariff Board The time In which tho tariff was pre pared undoubtedly was so short as to make It Impossible for the congrcs and Its experts to acquire the informs lion necessary strictly to conform to the declared measure In order to avoid criticism of this kind In tho future and for the purpose of moro nearly conform Ing to the party promise congress at Its last session made provision at my re quest for the continuance of a board cre aced under the authority of the maxi mum and minimum clause of tho tariff bill and authorized this board to expend the money appropriated under my di rection for the ascertainment of the cost of production at homo and abroad of the various articles Included In the schedules of tho Jfirlff Tho tariff board thus appointed and authorized inns been diligent in preparing Itself for the necessary Investigations The hope of those who havo advocated the use of this board for tariff purposes Is that tho question of tho rato of a duty Im posed shall become more of a business question and less of n political ques lion to bo ascertained by experts of long training and accurate knowledge Tho halt in business find the shock to business duo to the announcement
