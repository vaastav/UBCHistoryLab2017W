LV Ing this as a bast* and the Cecrease in the Atlantic fish' rw » be arguou for the prtar vation of our *alm»n waUi there «u yet time. The effect of the unrestricted catch was already visible in a decrease In Wash ington flsh. In *.< me «>f our streams the run bad fallen Mt per cent, and all bad de <fcrsas"d. He thought the remedy tor the threatened disaster lay in putting In num erous hatcheries, making certain close seasons, prohibiting certain fishing gear at piacess and closing the hatchery stream.* to fishermen within I.OOu fe*-t of their mouth*. He gave the results of Investigations to show the superiority of hatcheries over the natural supply. In his estimation the fry that reached ten weexs old by the natural methods was leas than one-half of 1 per cent. In the hatcheries ihey c'jid turn out 9» per cent I.a*t year the « mated catch on Puget »</u» i and Krua« r river was W.&uO.OOO pound* about lvtti.- 00S fish. Even by the natural method if theae fish had not been caught the to ereaee would have be»-n 500.000.0U0. At th« present time nil the hatcneries were only turning put a few million ana their product muM be Increased very extensively to m»jet the deficiency caused by the yearly catch. A tax of 1 p«*r cent , equitaoiy distributed •n the fish interests, would meet the ex pense of putting the machinery in motion to create a sufficient *upp.y, He estimated this tax would rnise about 133.W) next season, one-half of It on Puget sound. The Baker lake hatcheries should show some returns next year. This year they were handicapped by baa weather and deep snowa The tax spoken of would ■lore than double the capacity and turn out 35,000.000 fry. Of this It was estimated one In five would return mature fish. An experimental station was rwutly needed to provide facts regarding the best methods of propagating shell fish on the sound and to prevent the extermination of the sturg eon and other vanities besides the sal mon. Within six or eight miles of this city there could be turned out as many oyster* aa the entire state produces, and the Sitrnlsh flats furnished half as large an oyster area as could bo found on all tbe Atlantic coast. He believed that the proper place for the Federal hatchery, for which there had been made an appropriation oI|WM was on a tributary of the Eraser, as M> per cent, of thw Fraser river fish were caught on this aide by our fishermen and by plac ing It on one of the streams running Into that river we wou'd receive full benefits from It. A friend of his, whom he con sidered a reliable authority, nad investigat ed a stream running into ChlUlwack lake and found it all that could be desired and he was going to make a thorough Inves tigation dmself in\the spring of that lo cation. It it was suitable he would strong ly recommend It. Ho praised the efforts of the individual* who had established a hatchery on Hamlsh lake ;\nd said it would turn out 1,000,000 fry this year. Two hundred thousand 

CRRS from the Columbia river had been forward ed to it and 100,000 from the Sacramento hatchery were en route and the effort* of It* promoter* were meeting with grand success.

"If 1 am elected, I want to enter upon my duties untrammeled by pledges, so that I may do for my chosen people what I think the interests of labor demand." Mr. Gompers refuses to say what the probable action of the convention will be In regard to the socialist pronunclamento, which some delegates wiil demand, or what wiil lie the outcome In the conven tion of the right for the indorsement of free silver. "In the past we have defeated the social ists," he said, "and, in the past, likewise, we have come out for silver.

Continued From Page One. companies of Chicago. He it now endeav oring to amalgamate ail the street car in tercuts in one great corporation, and has caused a bill to be presented to the board o' aldermen, granting this corporation a blanket franchise for fifty years, covering all the lines in operation and every other route worth having. The value of the privileges covered by the bill is over 130.- 000,000, but no provision whatever is made for any return to the city for the presenta tion to Yerkes of this great property. I? Yerkes has his way, and passes the bill, he will control all the street car business of Chicago for the next half century, and at no time will he be required to contribute a cent to the city's treasury. The ordinance will come up for passage Monday night. It is said Yerkes has bought enough aldermen at 11.500 a head to pass the bill, but public indignation has reached such a pitch that It is hardly likely that the member* of the board will have the hardihood to earn their bribes, know ing that a howling mob awaits them. Mayor Harrison la leader of the opposi tion to the steal. He is supported by the Cook county Democracy and the Cook county Republican organization. Harrison has started out to raise a storm such as the city has never before seen. He has arranged for half a dozen mass me*t- Itigs and will speak at all of them. Former Governor Altgeld. who differs from the mayor on some political points, agrees wit'i him in this matter and will assist In the light. Altgeld advises the citizens of Chi cago to use ropt-s if necessary to orevent the obnoxious ordinance from passing the council. Mayor Harrison feels quite as strongly in the matter. He said today: "I would like to see 150.000 of the citizens of Chicago in and around the eity hall the night the franchise extension ordinances are voted on by the council. If the alder men are given to understand that the city will not tolerate such a fraud as is pro posed, it. will be Impossible to get those ordinances through the council."
