PORTLAND, Me., December 9.?Rev. PkorU. A Vimnco n. JUITIIIBOIUI1C, rcviui Vi n?p Episcopal Church at Setauket. Long Island, ths first defense witness In the trial of the divorce suit brought by Mrs. Madeline Masters Gron against her husband. Niels Gron, Danish diplomat, testified that Mrs. Gron told him she was "a free thinker, like her brother, Edgar Lee Masters, the poet." The witness said he had received this reply when he asked Mrs. Gron why she did not attend church regularly. Gron. the rector said, attended church whenever he was In Setauket. The witness said he had never seen Gron drink intoxicating liquors, but once Gron gave him a bottle of whisky. He said he still had some of the whisky. "Those who know Mr. Gron respect him as a man of high moral character. the witness said. "Some think him an idealist and impractical, but he is always respected." Advised Separation. Mr. Livingstone testified that Mrs. Gron had made him her confidant on several occasions. Once she had told htm she was going to get a separation from her husband, explaining that she was tired of the failure of a plan he was promoting to guarantee commercial products internationally. The witness said he had advised the separation "on the ground of manifest incompatability of temperament." In opening the case of the defense counsel for Gron said he would submit proof that the husband, far from allowing his wife to support him. as alleged, had contributed thousands of dollars to her support between 1916 and 1920. Taking the stand in the closing minutes of yesterday's session. Niels Gron said his wife's children by a former marriage were to blame for*many of his marital difficulties. He denied statements made by Mrs. Gron on the witness stand that she had once put him on a monthly allowance and paid his bills at the Harvard Club of New {York.

Tickets ^luired. i -VvUiA i.i- r, *i Girls and Th . BY HELEN 1 WORD has been received by the Olrl Scouts headquarters in the District that the Girl Scouts from various parts of the country, who attended Camp Andree Clark, the national encampment of the Scouts at Briarcliff, XT V Hiirlner t Vi a eiimmar xarrtn 5R2 merit badges In all. This made an average of more than one badge to each Scout who attended the camp. In addition to this number, IS lifesaving badges were given. There were 42 girls who qualified as bird hunters, 41 as flower finders, 37 as Scout naturalists, 30 as pioneers. 19 as cooks and 130 as home nurses. Others won first aid, health winner, sailor, swimming and athletic badges. The "District is very proud of Miss Hester Baden, fifteen-year-old Scout, who went from Washington to attend the camp and won six badges while there. She was the only Scout from the District to attend this camp last summer, but certainly covered herself with glory. Miss Baden won the soology badge, the bird hunter, flower finder. Scout naturalist, first aid and home nurse awards. She is a member oi troop s, Mrs. HerDert Hoovers troop, of which Miss Mary T. Voorheen Is lieutenant. Last Wednesday Miss Baden was in charge of the ice cream booth at the bazaar given at All Souls Manorial Church, at which the Scouts from Troop 8 assisted, and Miss Voorhees particularly commended the efficient way in which Miss Baden managed her phase of the work. MAKES GOOD RECORD. CENTRAL High School is especially proud of Josephine Irvin Gillis, who Is treasurer of the Girls' C Club and won two letters in swimming | last season. Miss Gillis is a native of Richmond, Va., and came to Washington in 1909. when she entered the Park View School, from which she was graduated. She was vice president of her class and captain of the school's "La Traviata" at Poll's. Josephine Lucchese Is a perfect' Vloletta from every point of view. She miles this heroine of Verdi's operatic version of Dumas' famous story of "The Lady of the Camellias" an attractive and real person. Her sweet, clear soprano voice was in excellent form last night and her arias, particularly the one which closed the first act. were delightfully sung. She . managed artistically to combine dramatic emotional qualities with her singing in a way that did not detract from the roundness of her notes, but rather added to their poignancy. She was the outstanding figure, of the opera histrionically as well as'vocally, and the famous Camtlle death-bed scene was full of dignity and sweetness as interpreted by Miss Lucchese. She is an American girl of the quaint. oia-iasnioncu type ui oeauiy mui is best preserved to this generation in old Ivory miniatures. She is slender for an operatic star and has a charming personality. Moreover, she alone of the entire cast did not anxiously watch with continuous care every motion of the baton which Aldo Franchetti. the agile little conductor, waved Imperatively. The capacity audience which listened to the opera In Poll's Theater last night applattded Miss Lucchese's arias with enthusiastic applause. Mario Valle. as Germont, the old father of the love-sick hero, gave Miss Lucchese's soprano voice excellent contrast with his rich baritone notes in the duet between them in the second act. His part was comparatively small, but he made the most of his opportunities and also gave his characterisation considerable dramatic coloring. Romeo Boscacci. as Alfredo, the hero, sang his tenor role with evident feeling, although some of his notes had a slight husklness. Anita Klinova, as Annina, the maid, wore a modish maid's costume which, while becoming, was certainly an anachronism in the Deriod of hoon skirts and ruffled breeches. Her lovely contralto voice had but little opportunity in the role. Frances Morosinl j was beautifully stately as Flora and I sans especially well in the third act. Natale Cervi and Francesco Curci save adequate bass support. The orchestra played the operatic ' score very well, even if a bit loud at ' times, and Franchetti, the conductor, j hustled nobly on a home-run stretch | from the orchestra pit to the back of the house and around to the stase in : time to bow with the principal sins- i ers before the audience at least once . after every scene. Mme. Tamaki-Miura, the delishtful little Japanese prima donna, will sins the title role of "Mme. Butterfly" this afternoon, and Dorothy Jardon, the star role in "Carmen" tonlsht. as a flttlns close for an unusually delishtful week of opera.
