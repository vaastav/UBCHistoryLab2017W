President Wilson today called on congress to enoct a program of legislation which he said would put the United States in the forefront of a movement to make the spiritual power of democ racy prevail thruout the world.

The Text of Message. The text of President Wilson's mes sage follows: When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the presi dent by the constitution to present to you an annual report on the state of the Union, I found myself dominated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's. "Let us have faith that right makes right, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it." a sentence immortal because it embodies in a form of utter simplicity and purity the essential state of the nation, the faith In which it was con ceived and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. With that faith and the birth of a nation found ed upon it came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail thruout the affairs of mankind, an order in which reason and right would take precedence of covetousness and force, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful American when I say that this sen tence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrans:ements of our domestic affairs and in our exercise of influ ence upon the affairs of the world. By this faith and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of its pres ent confusion and despair. It was this faith n-hich prevailed over the wicked forces of Germany. Tou will remem ber that the beginning of the end of this war came when the German peo ple found themselves face to face with the conscience of the world and real ized that Tight was everywhere ar rayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to perpe trate! I think, therefore, that it is true to say that this was the faith which won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which oij? gallant men went into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. ThU is the mission upon which de-.-mocracy came into the world. Democ racy ic an assertion of the right of the individuals to live and to be treated justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination o Individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy his equality among his fellows in the matter of rleht or privilege, and I think we all realize that the day has come when -nnrlnnrt fnt Two.)

Secretary Baker tailed by the House for "Breaking Faith." Debate on Johnson Immigra tion Bill To Be Limited. Washington, Dec. 7. Receipt of President Wilson's annual message was the ttrinciDal business before con- press today, altho the program in both the senate and house called for the inauguration of actual legislative work. The senate calendar today called for debate on the bill for federal regula tion of the meat packing industry, left over from the last session, but there was a possibility, it was said. It might gS over until some future date. In the house, legislation for the re striction cf immigration was expected to be taken up, the bill prohibiting immigration for a period of two years having been reported out of commit tee yesterday. Appropriation Bills Soon. The house appropriations commit tee, which originates all. money bills, has been meeting for some time and some of the minor measures soon will be ready for action. These bills will be the principal if not the only busi ness of the present session, and President-elect Harding has asked leaders to get them out of the way before March 4, so as to clear the decks for the major pieces of legislation to come 1 up at the special session to be called soon after inauguration. Representatives from the south and west are ready ,t demand a bill re viving the war finance corporation. This step was decided upon at a joint meeting of the house and senate agrl culture committees called to consider ways of meeting the farm conditions brought about by falling prices. Says Baker Broke Faith. Secretary Baker was asked today by the house military committee to ap pear before it Friday to explain why the war department has recruited an army of more than 180,000 men. Chairman Kahn of the house mili tary affairs committee said some com mittee members felt that the war de partment had broken faith with the committee, explaining that the army appropriation for the year was based on a maximum of 180.000 men with the understanding that such a force would be sufficient.

As soon as the result of the plebiscite in Greece, which resulted in favor of the return of former King Constantine became known here, the Greek patriarch called the holy synod and the lay council Into extraordinary session and it was do- cided to dispatch an energetic appeal to Constantine exhorting him to abandon his claim to the Greek throne in favor of Prince George, pointing out that his return to Greece not only would endanger the position of Greece, but Jeopardize the future of Hellenism.

For the protection of 'his own interests as well as those of state banks and bank patrons' ne sald he retainel private Wilson went tb the stand today when Commissioner Challis resumed taking of testimony for the supreme court. Practically the entire morning was taken up with testimony regarding the Salina bank troubles. Many letters and telegrams were Introduced by John Hunt, attorney for the defen dant, in establishment of the claim that Wilson exerted every effort to safeguard interests of the bank. No Advice from Attorney General. Early in his testimony Wilson was asked why he had retained S. M. Brewster and John Hunt as private , department. He said he had found thru experiences that he was either unable to find the attorney general in his office oe to secure the services de- sired in meeting legal problems. Every effort was made, the bank commissioner said, to protect deposi tors of the Salina bank. Following failure of the Kansas State bank and reorganization of the institution, close supervision was re'ained over the bank by the state department. ' In a period of five months, he said, five examinations of the bank were made. The law requires two examina tions a year.' It was in November. 191S. Wilson said, that H. J. Lefferdink came to the bank from Nebraska, He was highly recommended and put $46,000 in the Institution. He held many property interests. This was the second move in. reorganization following the Felix Broeker smash.

Immediate'y steps were taken to secure assigneenss against oan oinwn u Ele ments of property from Lefferdink and other - officers' of the bank. An ex aminer was placed in the bank and rigid supervision maintained. Steps were taken at once, Wilson said, to realize on property assignments, and many conferences were held with officers of the bank and their at' torneys. Telegrams and letters from Broeker relative to aid for the bank were read into the records. From December 30, 1918, to May, 1919. the state depart ment sought to realize on securities and stabilize the bank. When these efforts failed, the institution was closed. Told of Linn County Bank.

However, he indicated clear ly that in his opinion many of the charges against Wilson had failed. He indicated, tho, that he would welcome testimony from the defense relative to policies of the department and tho course taken by Wilson particularly in handling the Salina trouble. It is probable that Wilson's direct examination will occupy the remain der of the day. His cross examination will be taken up late this afternoon or Wednesday morning. Kansas Reserve Bank Buys a T.B.

Declares the Foreign Products Drive U. S. Producers Out. Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 7. Demands for protective tariffs covering farm products from peanuts to wool, were demanded by delegates to the conven tion of the American Farm Bureau Federation, in session here today. President J. R, Howard declared sentiment from all sections of the country was solidifying behind a tariff program, tho in the past the farmer Vas been rejrarded as a "free trader." "Our tariff demands are not radi cal," Howard said. "All that we want is ecfuality in tariff legislation as it pertains to industrial and agricultural products." The proposed duty on foreign pea nuts is not intended to make the bags at the Dan parKs smaller, out merely to afford protection for southern growers, who turn .much of their prod- uct into oil. They are now facing seri- ous competition from foreign imports of vegetable oil. Delegates from Michigan and Cali fornia, the largest bean producing states, are clamoring for a duty on Japanese beans. . Canadian shipments of potatoes are worrying American farmers.
