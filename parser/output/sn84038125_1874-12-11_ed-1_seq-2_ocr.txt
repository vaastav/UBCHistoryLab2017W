Interested persons should read it. -On the 3d t, November it was the "tidal wave " that shook up " Old Essex" Massachusetts.

Would it not be better "policy to harmonize differences and to "agree upon the best method of regaining "lost ground." -The Helena papers say the initial steps were taken in the Capital suit, on Thursday of last week, by serving on the Governor at Gaffney a notice to answer on the first day of the next session of the Supreme Court, to be holden in Virginia City in January.

The only cause assigned is the poor health and desire to retire from active business of H. W. Larkyn. well understood that Hon. Fernando Wood is laying his wires for the difficult and dangerous honor: of the Speakership, and it is considered that he will be a formidable, and, very likely, a successful candidate. He is experienced, very rich (an admirable qualification) and has a handsome wife; lastly, he is one of the few men who have survived the Mayoralty. An Ex-Mayor, like an Ex-President, is usually employed for nothing but funeral processions." -Governor Potts left for Washington last week. He says he is going on private business and to do what he can to secure favorable legislation for the Northern Pacific Railroad and intimates he is not going to make war on Judge Knowles. Well; all right, Governor. The people blocked that little game of yours, if there is any merit in universal wish, and if you really had influence to accomplish it; but if you want to look after your own affairs and do some good for the Territory without doing evil, and are sorry you put your foot in it, why may you have a good journey and good luck. -It is the design of the publisher of the NEW 

NORTH-WEST. after January 1st, 1875, to print the addresses of subscribers, with the date to which their subscription is paid, on each paper going out to the differ ent offices in Montana. The advantages of this are: a legible address, avoidance of "skipping" names, a saving of much writing, keeping subscribers advised each issue of the status of their subscription accounts and their speedy rectification in case of error and advice. That the ad dresses so printed may be gratifying, and that there may not be so frequent revision of the type addresses after the adoption of this method we would respectfully urge those in arrears to remit before the end of the year. -A few laya sinelMr, .1 Stbat iele graphed to Washington his resignation as Receiver of Public Moneys at E't41i, and was thereupon appointer by Go~ raor Potts Territorial -Auditor, vie -Ds&Geuge Callaoway, resigd.'.

In a supplementary sheet, enclosed to Territorial subscribers in this issue, we present the Message of President Grant to Congress on last Monday. It is longer and more argumentative on the Financial and Southern States government questions than his preceding messages. On the financial question the President takes strong grounds in favor of a certain and speedy return to specie basis, the endorsement of his position last session by the money influences of the country having evidently determined him to prominently identify his administration with the specie payment theory and "fight it out on that line." In the argument offered to support the recommendation for early legislation fixing a method whereby a return to a specie basis shall be accom plished there are many practical facts sub mitted, and, as a whole, the matter is pre sented in a strong, compact and forcible manner. Its weak point is in failing to suggest a practicable "method." It would have been desirable to have maintained the currency at a par with gold during the war and since. But it yielded to the inex orable logic of events and depreciated. Since the war it has risen to almost gold value, and will, without forcing legislation, under a wise and economical administration of governmental affairs steadily approxi mate to, and reach in reasonable time, that standard. Realizing that there are many advantages in a currency of specie value, it is not clear to us that the nethod of com pelling it by legislation, unless it shall be a gradual, unoppressive and auxilliary pro cess, is as desirable as such an economical administration of the country as shall give the currency an enhanced value in the commercial world. It took England thirty years to return to specie payment after her great wars, and in less than ten succeeding ours we have nearly reached that point. Acknowledging that the difference now existing is still a public detriment, it is to be hoped that the legislative remedy, if one is determined upon, shall not bring greater ills than those existing. On the question of the volume of currency the President is sagacious and prudent, and his recommendation for free:banicing,under such regulations to make the issue secure as Congress may determine, is likely to be the plan finally adopted as the compromise on the currency volume question which has been and will be violently agitated in Con gress. Another considerable portion of the Message is devoted to an explanation of the condition of affairs in the South, especially in Louisiana and Arkansas. In reviewing these matters the President is temperate, candid, liberal in his views, and firm in the intention to perform his duties under the law as Executive. To all reasonable men this portion of the Message must commend itself favorably, and we believe will go far toward disseminating a fuller knowledge of the facts and the purposes of the adminis tration toward the South, and in bringing about a better understanding and more cordial feeling between those people and the general government. The frank expla nation of affairs in Louisiana. and Arkansas and the action of the administration relative thereto, the showing that there are but 4,082 soldiers in all the garrisons south of the Delaware, the appeal to the people to dispassionately and patriotically consider the facts and be just, the avowal of the President that" the better citizens of the Southern States are not responsible for the violences that have occurred, his sympathy with their prostrate condition and in their having to submit to some oppressive and unjust governments, and the earnest desire that they shall administer their affairs without interference from the national Executive is as manly and noble an appeal to the better natures of the governed as was ever made by a ruler to a people. A rather important intimation in the Message is that in rlation to Cuban affairs. While expressing profound sympathy with the government of Spain in its internal dissensions, there is certainly evidenced by the Executive a dis ls_ footing in their war for independence. The President may mean more than that; but he certainly indicates that he will go to that extent at least if there is not a decided success by the Spanish before the adjourn ment of Congress. Another notable feature of the Message is the allusion to Chinese immigration, and especially in relation to their women. The tone of the remarks is so at variance with former expressions on the Chinese question from Washington as to lead to some hope ful anticipation that the practical ideas in relation to this element on the Pacific Coast are at last supplanting the hallucinations that have existed in the East about China men. If the Chinese population of San Francisco could be put in Washington during one session of Congress there would be some restrici ve legislation in regard to the ravages of Yellow Jack. The interest manifested in reviving the American shipping business should be shared by Congress, and also the disposition to establish the civil service rules, in which we trust the President incIihe the rule published by his authority in 1872, that residents of 'the Territories would be given preference for appointment to the Territo rlal offices. The relations of our govern ment with foreign powers are amdocble and ausprilous. These are some of the prinel pal points ofinteresttn the Message. Itis fully up to his pre~dinM g state papers as a whole, in somie features is superlor, and geerials y will eommand itself favorably to the nation. 14unt #on in the Ter1itories. Cor a.UuuIa~gp In Rdi sm s, Dec. Ab.

The wisdom of such a course seems to us calculated to win universal and immediate approval. * * But our principal purpose in this paper was to notice for the encouragement of our people the creditable relative standing of Montana among the other States and Ter ritories. In the table that shows the pub Ii c school expenditures of all the States and Territories per capita of legal school age, Montana stands second among the Territo ries, Colorado alone being ahead, and ninth among all the States and Territories com bined. So that we have the great honor, unaided by any school-fund, as all the States have, to see ourselves out-ranking thirty sovereign States in the provisions that we make for the support of our schools. This expenditure in Montana is $9.43 per capita, Colorado being $17.50 in the same table, and North Carolina standing at the foot with only $0.55, and Georgia being but little better. Indeed, all the Southern States stand disgracefully low; while some of the Northern States, as Maine, standing at $4.27 in the scale, are discreditably defi cient. Massachusetts, as might be expect ed, stands at the head of the list, expend ing $21.74 for every person of school age within its borders. 

NOTEB OF THE DAY. The President's "foreign relations"-Mr. and Mrs. Sartoris. Lydia Thompson and her blondes propose to stay in London. The latest parlor game-Sitting up. It takes two to play it. The soliloquy of Hamlet contains eighty one words, of which all but three are Anglo Saxon. The old Imperial hoisting works at Vir ginia City, Nev., were blown down by the recent storm. The Walla Walla farmers did not get any considerable plowing done this fall. First too dry, then frozen. Charlotte Cushman is on the Pacific Coast taking one of her annual farewells, if she has recovered from a recent severe illness. The proprietors of the London Times now cast their own type, and the same plan is about to be adopted by other London papers. Trinity Church, Portland, Oregon, was damaged $10,000 by fire Thanksgiving Day. It burned five hours and run to the steeple top. A Milwaukee man says he wishes he could be wrecked and come home and find his wife married to some other fellow, the way Enoch Arden did. V. V. Smith, who solicits General Grant to make him Governor of Arkansas, is Volney V. Smith, formerly of Linn county, Oregon, son of Delazon Smith. The South Carolina Senate has requested Governor Moses to furnish that body with a list of the convicts pardoned the past year, with the reasons therefor. Ex-Senator James Harlan is reported to have returned to Iowa to live. He has been editing the Washington Chronicle since his retirement from the Senate. A bill will be introduced at the next ses sion of the Nevada Legislature for the sup pression of gambling. It repeals the pres ent system and is very stringent against gambling of any kind. The best shot ever heard of has been made in Calais, Maine, where a gentleman fired, in midnight darkness, at the bark of a dog, and the next morning found the animal dead, the bullet having hit him in the throat. Corpulent old lady-I should like a ticket for the train. Booking clerk, (who thinks he will make a joke)-Yes; will you go in the passenger train or cattle train ? Lady Well, if you are a specimen of what I shall experience in the passenger train, give me a ticket for the cattle train, by all means. There is said to be a negro boy living in Newport Va, who will drink kerosene oil by the quantity whenever he can get it. He craves it to such an extent that the family are compelled to hide not only the can which contains it, but even the lams. dmaehim act " like afrantic baboon." The Walla Walla Union, of Nov. 21st, says: "Mr. Wmin. Maskelyn informs us his sheep are dying at the rate of from ten to fifteen per day. He is not certain as to the cause, but thinks it is leeches in the liver. Mr. Maskelyn's herd is a very fine lot of sheep and have been well cared for and are now being well fed-still they die by the dozen and their owner would be glad if anybody qan suggest a remedy, less severe than taking out the sheep's liver. 

FATAL AFFRAY. M. Maguire Killed by George W. Rea. It is again our painful duty as a faithful chronicler of events to announce the killing of another human being in our midst. Wednesday afternoon, about 2 o'clock, four men were congregated in a small building, nearly opposite this office, all of them, it seems being under the influence of whisky. The men Reaand Maguire became involved in a difficulty, which terminated in the death of the latter, as set forth by the ver dict of the Coroner's Jury below. George W. Rea is well known in this Territory as a hunter, trapper and guide, and as one of the discoverers of the Cherry Creek mines. Maguire came here in 1867, a soldier of ym F., 18th Infantry. He was di.bg from the servicein 1869, sinee which time he has -worked at this place and at the Crow Agency. He was a wheelwright and cabinet maker, and an eellent workman.

The Sheriff was acting without bonds, and the Board of Supervi. sors refused to order a new one. Several officials being under indictment, the citi zens, despairing of relies last Wednesday, in a body proceeded to the Court House to demand the resignation of a. number of county officers, all of whom fled except Sheriff Crossby, a negro, who resigned. On Saturday a card, signed by Crossby, galled on the Republicans of Warren county to support him. He denied its authorship. This morning the negroes advanced on the town by six roads, with results already stated. They numbered about 750. CzNcrNNATI, Dec. 9.-The Times' Vicks burg dispatches say the fight was renewed at Snyder's Bluff ten miles from the city last evening between a body of several hundred negroes and forty whites. A courier was sent to Vicksburg for reinforce ments, which were sent out on double quick, and after a short skirmish four negroes were killed and three wounded. The negroes retreated last night. The negroes drove in the white pickets from the fort and it is said have entrenched thei'e. They are receiving large reinforce ments from other counties and at last accounts were marching on the city up the Paguera road, driving the whites before them. They fired into a funeral procession yesterday wounding one white man. The fire was returned and three negroes were killed. The Black Hills Bill. WASHNIGTOho, Dec. 9.-The bill to pro vide for the extinguishment of the Indian title to the Black Hills reservation, intro duced by McCrary and referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs, provides for the appointment by the President of a com mission to negotiate a treaty with the Indians for the transfer by them to the United States of all their title and claim to the said reservation to the end that the same may be opened for settlement. A Daring Robbery. 

KANSAS CITY, Dec. 8.-Five mounted, armed, masked men, flagged, stopped and entered the Kansas Pacific Express train near Munci, this afternoon, and robbed the Wells-Fargo Express Co.'s safe of about $27,000, one case of gold dust for Kountz Bros., New York, constituting a portion of the plunder.

NEW YORK, Dec. 8.-The Jersey City Presbyterian publishes the verdict to-day in the case of John S. Glendenning, acquit ting him of the charges of seduction and breach of promise of marriage, but finding him gmuilty of unministerial and unchristian conduct in making Miss Pomeroy presents, visiting her so often, and at unseasonable hours, and being on such intimate terms with her as to occasion public suspicion of impropriety. The Presbytery passed a reso lution dissolving the pastoral relations between Glendenning and the Prospect Avenue Church in view of the disturbing influence incident to the case.
