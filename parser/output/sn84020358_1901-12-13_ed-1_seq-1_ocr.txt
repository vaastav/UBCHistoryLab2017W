In case Chili's reply is not favorable, Argentina will withdraw her minister from Santiago de Chili, and the ante cedents and history of the misunder standing will be forwarded to Great Britain for arbitration. A decree, ordering the mobilization, January 1, of the reserves of 1878 and 1879, has been issued. These reserves amount to 60,000 men. The chamber, in secret session, has voted the credits necessary for the mobilization of the militia. Chili is busily engaged in buying warships, aiming to surpass the power of the Argentine fleet. Commercial circles' here hope the in fluence of the pope will prevent a con flict of arms between the two coun tries. Calm reigns here. There have been no warlike manifestations, but all parties are united In support of the government. The Argentine and for eign newspapers published here unani mously counsel the Argentine govern ment to maintain its present energetic attitude. The Argentine government yesterday deposited In London 2,100,000 to in sure the payments of the coupons of the Argentine debt. The Argentine government possesses aother reserve fund of $13,000,000.

The war office has Issued a statement to-night dealing with the Boer treatment of Colonel Benson's wounded at Brakenlaagte, which Is a result of a special Invest igation of the matter instituted by Lord Kitchener. The statement sets forth that eight een officers and men of Colonel Ben eon's command were kindly and even carefully treated by the Boers, while the remaining eeventy-five men who were examined testified that they wit nessed and suffered atrocities worse than those which followed the Vlak fontein disaster. These latter said that unarmed and wounded men lying around the guns were killed at close range, and that the survivors of the en gagement suffered torture, being robbed and stripped of their clothing in spite of their wounds and broken limbs. Lord Kitchener says' that evidently the Boer leaders are no longer able to repress murder and outrage on the part of their subordinates.

The Chronicle Telegraph says to-day: "Some exten sive Improvements and enlargements of the various plants of the United States Steel Corporation have Juet been de cided upon by the advisory board of the big steel combination. It has been developed that the sole object of the inspection tour of President C. M. Schwab and other officers last month was to consider suggestions made by the district managers. The most lm portlon action of the board was a de cision to largely increase the steel pro ducing capacity of the corporation, as the output of finished material is far in advance of that of the Bessemer converters and open hearth plants. ' "One of the plans Is to equip all the open hearth furnaces of the Carnegie Steel company at Duquesne, that the steel may be made by the Monell pro cess, which has already proved so suc cessful at Homestead. It is estimated that the monthly output can be increas ed thousands of tons by adopting this process at all the open hearth plants of the company, "It has been decided by the American Sheet Steel company to install addi tional mills for the rolling of heavier gauges and the work is to be begun at a number of the plants in a short time. "The American Tin Plate company will also in the near future install ma chinery for the rolling of black plates for tin mills that will be largely auto matic. It is said on reliable authority that machinery in this process will do from two-thirds to three-fourths of the work now done by hand on the hot mills and the output will be greatly in creased. "With the new method, it Is estimated that the American Tin Plate company will be able to compete with foreign manufacturers at home without the aid of tariff, which would result in the United States becoming the greatest tin plate manufacturing country in the world." An Agreement Reached After Four llonra' Debate-Senator Lodge Tried to Get a Vote Yeeterdar Afternoon but Failed Othrr Senators Dealroue of Speaking on the Convention. Washington, Dec. 12. The Senate agreed to-day to take a vote before ad journment next Monday on the new Hay-Pauncefoto treaty for the abroga tion of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and the opening of the way for the con struction of a canal across the isthmus of Panama by the United States. This agreement was reached after four hours of debate sufllclently interesting to in sure the constant attendance of most of the senators. Senator Spooner, who was one of the principal speakers of the day, had Just concluded when Senator Lodge made an effort to secure a vote, It developed there were other senators who desired to be heard, the result be ing that the date for the vote was post poned until Monday. The agreement provides for an adjournment of the Senate from to-day until Monday and for a meeting at 11 o'clock of that day, one hour In advance of the usual time The understanding is that us soon as practicable after the Senate convenes, Senator Lodge shall move an executive session and that the treaty shall have the entire attention of the Senate until a final vote is reached, before the ad Journment for that day. The principal speakers to-day beside Senator Spooner were Senator Money and Senator Foraker. Mr. Money, while finding much in the treaty to criticise, said that as he found the fortunes of the proposed canal across the Isthmus inextricably Inter twined with the treaty, he could not see his way clear to doing anything that would prevent or even delay ratifica tion. The particular features of the new treaty with which he found fault were those retaining the neutrality pro vision of the Clayton-Bluwer conven tlon and specifying police control of the canal when built. He argued that the effect of these provisions Inevitably must be to limit and prescribe the power of the United States to control its own property in case of war. Senator Foraker maintained that provisions of the new treaty meet every objection made to the original Hay Pauneefote treaty and cover every es sential thing that was included in the amendment made by the Senate to that document. He regarded it as of the ut most importance that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty Bhould be wiped out. This result was effected by the convention under consideration. He asserted that (Continued on SlxthPage.) "

He said: "The building of these tunnels and of a great union station at Seventh ave nue and Thirty-third street In this bor ough means that a passenger can ar rive in the heart of the city without change of cars from any part of the United States. It consolidates as one line the Pennsylvania railroad and the Long Island railroad and passengers from all parts of the United States can go to the summer resorts of Long Island without change of cars."

"We are not Interested in anything but the passenger problem," Mr. Bald win replied. "We seek to provide ade quate facilities for the transportation of the traveling public, and such facil ities as the greatest city in this coun try ought to have." "Will there be no change of cars necessary In transferring passengers from the regular steam roads to the electric tunnel roads?" "Not at all. Electric locomotives will be hitched right, on to the trains of passenger and express cars and will draw them swiftly throughly the under ground passages without disturbing the passengers." "How much do you estimate the cost of these Improvements to be?" . "In the neighborhood of $50,000,000, all told." number of patterns belonging to the American liner New York, which is be ing repaired at the dock, were ftlso de stroyed.
