Following Is a brief synop sis including some direct excerpts of the more important feature- of tlie message: TO THK 

S'KNATK AND HOI "SB OF UKfRBSBNATlVKS: Nothwithstandiig the a ide burdens rendered necessary by the war. our eople rejoice in a very sat isfactory and steadily-increaainK degree of prosperity evidenced by th largest volume of busings evr recorded. Manu facture hm-e been productive, agricul tural pursuits have yienied abundant re turns, labor ia all fields of industry "is better rewarded. revenue legislation passed by the present congress ha in creased the treasury's receipts ft the amount estimated by it authors; the finances of th government have been suc cest fully e.dmlaistt red and its credit ad vwneed to the first rank: while its cur rency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common tlag and for a rignieous cause has strengthened the national spirit, and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bond between every bcc lion il the country. 

CONTROVERSY WITH SPAIN RE VIEWED. In reviewing the controversy which led lip to the war with fc-nain. the president takes up the thread or n.irratUe Where it terminated in hi litt annual mes sai;e. He concluded: "It was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of re form to which she haJ become irrevota blv committed." It became evident, however, that the proposed plans were barren of good re suits. No tangible relief was afforded the reconcent rados, among whom the rate of mortality frightfully increased; the proffered expedient of zones of cultiva tion proved illusory, and it was apparent that nothing save the physical eshaus tion of Spain or the Cubans and the prae tical ruin of the island of Cuba could re sult from the struggle then In progress. DESTHICTiON OF THE 

MAINE. At this critical juncture the destruc tion of the battleship "Maine' occurred Concerning it the president says: "It is a striking evidence of the poise anil sturdy good sense i..s:inguislilng our national character that this shocking blow, falling upon a generous people, al ready deeply touched uy preceding events in t uba, did not move them to an ia stant. desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition ol danger ami disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed, by. whomso ever wrought. Resuming the war narrative, the presi dent directs attention to the measures including the t5,iWU.UJU appropriation for national oeiense, tancn to place the country on a war footings and adds: "It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war, when it did come, found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict." 

APPREHENSION BY EUROPEAN POWERS. Refertnee is made to the apprehension of coming strife by the continental pow ers, voiced in the address to the presi- aent tnrougn tneir ambassadors and en voys, and to the president's reply thereto tdill animated, however, by the hope of a peaceiui solution ot the difficulty, and obeying the dictates of dutv. tne r.resi oem reiaxeo no enori to bring about a Fpeedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne gotiations with the Madrid government proved futile, so far as practical results were concerned, and then it was the president presented the nuestion to con Kress, saying: "in the name of humanity. in ine name or civilization, in behalf of endangered American interests, which give us the right anil duty to speak and to act. tne war in t una must stop. lilt Ur,l L.A HA 1 ltl.

HKSS The result of this statement of the case was tne adoption of the memorable iolnt resolution oy congress, declaring the pur pose of the I nited States to intervene between the Spaniards and Cuban. Fol lowing swiftly upon the enactment of the resolution, came the severence of diplo mane relations net ween me two coun tries, the proclamation ef a blockade of 1 uban ports, the call Tor volunteers, and the formal declaration of the existence of a state of war. All other governments were immediately notified of the exist ence of war and each proclaimed nen trality. "It is not among the least grati- i.uNK inciuenis 01 tne strure- e that th obligations of neutrality were impartially anl diliicult circumstances uifiiirtitni uy an, oiien unuer delicate THE PREPARATION" FOR WAR. The president reviews at lene-th the work of preparation for war, referring particularly to the enlistment of the vol unteers, to tne material increase of the navy in both men and ships, and to the precautionary measures taken for the protetlon of the seaboard coast and cities. "The aggregate number of mines placed was l.'iXi. at the principal harbors from Maine to California." Referring to "the difficult and im- Fiortant character of the work per ormcd hv the signal corps the president says: "This service was invaluable to the executive in directing the operations of the army and navy. With a total force of over 1.3. the loss was by disease, in camp and Tield, officers and men included, only five." As to the authorized loan of J20oH 000 which was taken entirely by small bid ders, the president says: "This was a most encouraging and significant result showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the neonle tn uphold their country's honor." taking up chronologically the events of the war. the president reviews them care fully. The first encounter was the shell ing of Matanzas on April 27. This was followed by an engagement which w: "Destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime warfare. 

DEWEY'S WONDERFUL VICTORY. This was Commodore Dewev's wnnrter. ful victory at Manila, on May . "The ef fect of this remarkable victory" says the president, "upon the spirit of' our neonle and upon the fortunes of the war was in stant. A prestige or invincibility thereby attached to our arms, which continnoH throughout the struggle." The president says that "Only reluc tance to cause net-dless loss of life and property prevented the t-arlv storming and carture of the citv (Manila), and therewith the absolute military occupan cy of th- whole group." Following the memorable trip of the battleshin Oregon from San Francisco to Kev West, and the bombardment ol San Juan and the forts of Santiago, to which special reference is maae. tne president says: 

LIEL'T. HOBSON'S EXPLOIT. The next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen, but the world, by its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven volunteers, blocked the outlet from Santiago harbor hv sinking the oilier Merrlmac in the channel, under a f.erce tire from the shore batteries, escap ing with their lives as by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of he roes was cordially appreciated bv the Spanish admiral." THE SANTIAGO CAMPAIGN. The campaign of Santiaco. resulting the investment and oai iure of that city, is referred to as a bri'iiant achieve- mem. a oriei review is tnen presented i A of the decisive naval combat of the war j on July 3. resulting In the comnlete Hp. struction of Admiral Crevera's Meet.

TR1P.FTE TO THOSE WHO COULD Not GO. The president hears testimony and pays fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de votion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortunate ly were not required outside of the United States." They did their whole duty and earned the gratitude of the nation. The president then salts: "In tracing these ev ents we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the Divine Master for His Watchful care over us, and His safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment, and offers humble prayer for the continuance of His favors." THK 

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. The peace negotiatons, which followed soon after the capitulation of Santiago, and the preparation and signing of the protocol, are discussed at length. Refer ring to the work of the peace commis sioners at Paris, the president says: "These negotiations have made hopeful progress, so that 1 trust noon to be able to lay u definite treaty before the senate, -with u review of the steps leading to its signature." 

GOVERNMENT OF OUR NEW POS SESSIONS. "I do not discuss at this time the gov ernment or tenure of the new possesions which will come to us as a result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratiiied. In the meantime, and until the congress has legislated other wise, it will be my duty to continue the ii win iu inai wiiiitr our navy military governments which have existed since our occupation, and to give to the people security in life and property and encouragement tinder a just and beneti cent rule. THE FUTURE OF CUBA "As soon as we are In possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a covemment for them selves. This should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent witn safety anu assure'i success, it is im portant that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commer cial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our dutv to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage the industry of tne people, and assist them to form government which shall be free and in dependent, thus realizing the best aspira lions oi me UDan people. A HUMANE GOVERNMENT. "Spanish rule must be replaced by just, benevolent and humane govern mint, created by the people of Cuba capable of performing all international obligations, and which shall encourage tnrnt, industry ana prosnenty. and pro mote peace and good will among all of tne inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither re venge nor passion should have a place in tne new government. L ntll there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government Inaugurated military occupation win oe continuea FRIENDLY WITH ALT, THE REST OF THE WORLD. The president says that with one ex ception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse of the United States with the rfreat family of nations during the past year has been marked with cordiali ty.

QUESTION WITH AUSTRIA-HUN GARY. As to the killing and wonndlne of strik ing miners in Luzerne countv. Pa., which aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun- garian government, many of the miners being subjects of that irovernment. the president expects to reach a haruonious understanding on the subiect with Au stria- 1 1 ungary. f'he hope is expressed that the restrle- tions imposed by Belgium on the imnor- tation of American cattle will at nn purlv day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amer ican cattle under proper regulations. THE 

NICARAGUA CANAL. The president expects that the Nicara gua canal commission will shortly be able 10 report nnany. "l nave not hesitated to express my convictions." savs the nre- ident, "that considerations of expediency tnd international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an inter oceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of tbe status ouo until the canal commission shall have reported and the United States congress shall have nau tne opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter." 1 he president regards, in view of our newiy-acquired interests in the Pacific ocean, the construction of such a mari time highway as now more tnan ever in dispensable. 

EVENTS IN THE CHINESE EMPIRE. Concerning the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese empire, the president says that our position among nations gives the equitable claim to con sideration and friendly treatment in this regard, and that it will be his aim to subserve our large interests in the orient by all means appropriate to th e constant policy of our government.

BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE There Is Sunshine on Every Cloud Says Dr. Talmage. What We Consider God's Afflictions on l's Are Always Influences for Good Why the I scful Are Tbea. Copyright, 1S38.J Washington. Dec, 4. In this discourse Dr. Talmage takes an optimistic view of many tilings that are usually accounted as inexplicable in human experience and shows us that even trouble and affliction may not be wholly without their brighter ride Text, Psalm 49:4: "1 will open my dark saying upon the harp." The world is full of the inexplicable Ihe impassable, the unfathomable, the Insurmountable. We cannot go three ; steps in any direction without coming : ,, n ..;nKi har,t u-nll nf mvsterv rb' UP agonist MarU W311 Of mjSterj, Hi. dies, paradoses, profundities, laby rinths, problems that we cannot solve hieroglyphics that we cannot decipher. anagrams we cannot spell out, sphinxes that will not speak. For that reapnn David in my text 'proposed Jo take up some of these somber and dark things and try to set them to sweet musie.. "I will open my dark sayings on a harp." So 1 look off upon society and find people in unhappy conjunction of circumstances, and ihey do not know what it means, and they have a right to ask: Why is this-? Why is thai? And 1 think I will be doing a good work by trying lo explain some of these strange- things and make you more content with your lot. and I shall onl3- be answering questions that have often been asked me or that we have all asked ourselves while I try to set these mysteries to music and open my dark sayings on n harp. Interrogation the first: Why docs God take out of the world those who are useful and whom we cannot spare and leave alive and in good health so many who are only a nuisance to the world? I thought I would begin with the very toughest of all Ihe seeming inscrutables. Many of the most useful men and women die at 20 or 40 years of age, while you often find useless peo ple alive at CO and "0 and 80l John Careless wrote to Dradford, who was soon to be put to death, saying: "Why doth God suffer me and other such cat erpillars to live that can do nothing but consume the alms of the church and take away so many worthy workmen in the. Lord's vineyard ?" Similar ques tions are often asked. Here are two men. The one ia a noble character and a Christian man. He chooses for a lifetime companion one who has been tenderly reared, and she is worthy of him and he is worthy of her. As mer chant or farmer or professional man or mechanic or artist he toils to edu cate and rear his children, ne is suc ceeding, but he has not yet established for his family a full competency. - He seems indispensable to that household, but one day, before he has paid off the mortgage on his house, he is coming home through a strong northeast wind, and a chill strikes through him, and four days of pneumonia end his earth ly career, and the wife and children go into a struggle for shelter and food. His next door neighbor is a man who, though strong and well, lets his wife Bupport him. ne is around at the gro cery store or some general loafing place in the evenings, while his wife sews, nis boys are imitating his example and lounge and swagger acd swear. All the use that man is in that house is to rave because the coffee is cold when he comes to a late breakfast or to say cutting things about his- wife's looks, when he furnishes nothing for her wardrobe. The best thing that could happen to that family would be that man's fu neral, but he declines to die. He lives on and on and on. So we have all no ticed that many of the useful are early cut off, while the parasites have great vital tenacity. I take up this dark saj-ingbn my harp and give three or four thrums on the string in the way of surmising and hopeful guess. Perhaps the useful man was taken out of the world because he and his family were so constructed that they could not have endured some great prosperity that might have been just ahead, and they all together might hav gone down in the vortex of worldliness which every year swallows up 10.000 households. And so he -went while h was humble and consecrated, and they were by the severities of life kept close to Christ and fitted for usefulness here and high scats in Heaven, and when they meet at last before tha throne they will acknowledge that, though the fur nace was hot, it purified them and pre pared them for the eternal career of glory and reward for which no other kind of life could have fitted them. On the other hand, the useless man lived on to 50 or 60 or 70 years because all the ease he ever can have he must have In this world, and you ought cot there fore begrudge him his earthly longev ity. In all the ages there has not a single loafer ever entered Heaven. There is no place for him there to hang around. Interrogation the second: Why do good people have so much trouble, sick ness, bankruptcy, persecution, the three black vultures, sometimes put ting their fierce beaks into one set of jangled nerves? I think now of a good friend I once had. He was a conse crated Christian man, an elder in the church, and as polished a Christian gen tleman as ever walked Broadway. First his general health gave way. arid be hobbled around on a cane, an old man at 40. After awhile paralysis struck him. Having by poor health beeD compelled suddenly to quit busi ness, he lost what property he had. Then his beautiful daughter died; then a son became hopelessly demented. Another son. splendid of mind and com manding of presence, resolved that he would? tke pgrp of nis fathers house hold, but under the swoop of yellow fevtr at Fcrnandlhti. F"lit., lie sudden ly expired. So you know good men and women who have had enough troubles, you think, to crush 50 people. No worldly philosophy could take such a trouble and set it to music or play it on violin or flute, but 1 dare to open that dark saying on a golden harp. You wonder I hat very consecrated people have trouble? Did you ever know any very consecrated man or woman who hail not had great trouble? Never! It was through their troubles sanctified that they were made very good. If you find anywhere in this city a man who has now and always lias had perfect health and never lost a child, and has "always been popular, and never had business struggle or misforlune, who is distinguished for goodness, pull your wire for a tele graph messenger boy and send me word, and I will drop everything and go right away to look at him There never has been a man like that and never will be. Who are those arrogant, self-conceited creatures who move about without sympathy for others and who think more of a St. llernard dog. or an Alderney cow, or a Southdown sheep, or a Berkshire pig than of a man? They never had any trouble, or the trouble was never sanctified. Who are those men who listen with a moist eye as you tell them of suffering, and who have a pathos in their voice, and a kindness in their manner, and an ex cuse or an alleviation for those gone astray? They are the men who have graduated at the royal academy of trouble, and they have the diploma written in wrinkles on their counte nances. My! my! What heartaches they ha'1! What tears they have wept! What injustice they have suffered! The mightiest influence for purification and salvation is trouble. No diamond fit for a crown until it is cut. No wheat fit for bread till it is ground. There are only three things that can break off a chain a hammer, a file or a fire and trouble is all three of them. The greatest writers, orators and re formers get much of their force from trotible. What gave to Washington Irving that exquisite tenderness and pathos which will make his books fa vorites while the English language con tinues to be written and spoken? An early heartbreak that lie never once mentioned, and when. 30 years after the death oi" Matilda Hoffman, who was to have been his bride, her father picked up a piece of embroidery and said: "That is a piece of poor Matilda's work manship." Washington Irving sank from hilarity into silence and walked away. Out of that lifetime grief the great author dipped his pen's mightiest reenforccment. Calvin's "Institutes of Religion," than which a more wonder ful book was never written by human hand, was begun by the author at 25 years of age because of the persecution by Francis, king of France. Faraday toiled for all time on a salary of SO a year and candles. As every brick of the wall of Babylon was stamped with the letter N. standing for Nebuchadnezzar, so every part of the temple of Christian achievement is stamped with the let ter T, standing for trouble. When in England a man is honored with knighthood, he is struck wifb the flat of the sword. But those who have come to knighthood in the kingdom of God were first struck, not with the flat of the sword, but with the keen edge of the Bcimetcr. To build his magnifi cence of character, Paul could not have spared one lash, one prison, one ston ing, one anathema, one poisonous viper from the hand, one shipwreck. What is true of individuals is true of nations. The horrors of the American revolution gave this country this side of the Mis sissippi river to independence, and the conflict between England and France gave the most of this country west of the Mississippi to the United States. France owned it, but Napoleon, fearing that England would take it, practically made a present to the United States, for be received only $15,000,000 for Louisi ana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Ne braska, Iowa", Minnesota. Colorado, Da kota, Montana,, Wyoming and the In dian Territory. Out of the fire of the American revolution came this country cast of the Mississippi, out of the Eu ropean war came that west of the Mis sissippi river. The British empire rose to its nresent overtowering grandeur Uirough gunpowder plot, and Guy Fawkes conspiracy, and Northampton insurrection, and Walter Raleigh's be heading, and Bacon's bribery, and Cromwell's dissolution of parliament, and- the battles of Edge Hill, and the vicissitudes of centuries. So the earth itself, before it could become an appro- nnate and beautiful residence tor tne human family, had, according to geol ogy, to be washed by universal deluge and scorched and made incandescent by universal fires, and pounded by sledp-e hammer of icebenrs, and wrenched hy earthquakes that split con tinents, and shaken by volcanoes tnat tossed mountains and passed through the catastrophes of thousands of years before Paradise became possible, and the groves could shake out their gTeen banners, and the first garden pour its c.nmnp-e of color between the Gihon and the Hiddekel. Trouble a good thing for the rocks, a eood thinjr for nations. as well as a cood thinff for individuals. So when you push against me with a sharp interrogation point: hy do tbe ood suffer? I open the dark saying on harp and. thoueh I can neither play an orran or cornet or hautbov'or bugle or clarinet. I have taken some lessons in the Gospel harp, and if you would like to hear me I will play you these: All things work tog'etner tor good to ihose who love God." "Now no Chasten ing for the present seemeth to be joy ous, but grievous, nevertheless after ward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are ex ercised thereby." "Weeping may en dure for a nicht, but loy cometh in the morning." What a sweet thing is a harp, and I wonder not that in wales, the Country of my ancestors, the harp has become the national instrument, and that they have fe stivals where grtat prizes arc offered in the competition be tween harp and harp, or that weird Sebastian Krard was much of hi timo bent over this chorded ond vibrating triangle find was not satisfied until he had given it a compass of six octaves, from K to E with all the semitones, or t hat when King Saul was demented the son of Jesse came before him and. put ting his fingers among the charmed strings of the harp, played the devil out of the crazed monarch, or that in Heaven there shall be harpers harping with their harps. So you will rot blame me for opening the dark saying on the tiospel harp: Tour harps, ye trembling saints, Down from the willows take; Ioud the praise of love Divine Bid every string awake! Interrogation third: Why did the good God let sin or trouble come iulo the world when He might have kept them out ? My reply is: He had a good reason. He had reasons that He has never given us. lie had reasons which He could no more make us understand in our finite state than the father, start ing out on some great and elaborate en terprise, could make the two-year-old child in ils armchair comprehend it. One was to demonstrate what grandeur of character may be achieved on earth by conquering evil. Had there been no evil to conquer and no trov.ble to con sole, then this universe would never have known an Abraham, or a Moses, or a Joshua, or an Ezekiel, or a Paul, or a Christ, or a Washington, or a John Milton, or a John Howard, and 1.000.CCO victories which have been gained by the consecrated spirits of all ages would never have been gained. Had there been no battle there would have been no victory. Nine-tenths cf the anthems of Heaven would never have been sung. Heaven could never have been a thou sandth part of the Heaven that it is. I will not say that I am glad that sin and sorrow did enter, but I do say that I am glad that after God has given all His reiisons to an assembled universe He will be more honored t han if sin and sorrow had never entered, and that the unfallen celestials will be outdone and will put down their trumpets to listen, and it will be in Heaven, when those who have conquered sin and sorrow shall enter, as it would be in a small singing school on eaHli if Thalbergond Gottschalk and Wagner and Beethoven and Tvbeinberger and Schuman shoukl all at once enter. The immortals that have been chanting 10.000 years before the throne will say, as they close their librettos: "Oh, if we could only sing like that!" But God will say to those who have never fallen, and consequent ly have not been redeemed: "You must be silent now. You have not the quali fication for this anthem." So they tit with closed lips and folded hands, and sinners saved by grace take up the har mony, for the Bible says: "No man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth." But now I come nearer home and put a dark saj-ing on the Gospel harp, a style of question that is asked a mil lion times every year. Interrogation the fourth: Why do T have it so hard while others have it so easy? Or, Why do I have so much difficulty in getting a livelihood, while others go. around with a full portmonnaie? Or, Why must I wear these plain clothes, while others have to push hard to get their wardrobes closed, so crowned are they with brilliant attire? Or. Why should I have to work so hard, while others have 363 holidays eveTy year? They are all practically one question. I answer them by eaying it is because the Eord has nis favorites, and ne puts extra dis cipline upon you and extra trial, be cause He has for you extra glory, extra enthronement and extra felicities. That is no guess of mine, but a Divine" says so: "Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth." "Well," says some one: "I would rather have a little less in Heaven and a little more here. Discount my Heavenly robe ten per cent, and let me now put it on a fur-lined overcoat: put me ina less gorgeous room of the house of many mansions and let me have a house here in a better neighbor hood." No, no; God is not going to rob Heaven, which is to be your residence for nine hundred quadrillion of years, to fix up your earthly abode, which yo.i will occupy at most for less than a cen tury, and where you may perhaps stay only ten years longer, or only one year, or perhaps a month mere. Now, you had better cheerfully let God have His way, for, you see. He has been taking care of. folks for near 0.000 years and knows how to do it and can see what is best for you better than you can your self. Don't think you are too insignifi cant to be divinely cared for. It was said that Diana, the goddess, could not be present to keep her temple at Ephe sus from burning because she was at tending upon the birth of him who w as to be Alexander the Great. But I tell you that your God and my God is so great in small things as well as large things, that He could attend the cradle of a babe and at the same time tbe burn ing of a world. And God will make it all right with jou, and there is one song that you will sing every hour your first ten years, in Heaven, and the refrain cf that song will be: "I am so glad God did not let me have it my own way!" Your case willbe all fixed up in Heaven, and there will be such a reversal of conditions that we can hardly find each other for some time. Some of us who have lived in first-rate houses here and in first-rate neighborhoods will be found, because of our lukewarmnessof earthly service, living on one of the back streets of the celestial city, and clear down at the end cf it at No. 803 or 909 or 1505, while seme who had unattractive earthly abodes, end a cramped one at that, will in the heavenly city be in a house front ing the royal plaza, right by the im perial fountain or on the heights over looking the river of life, the chariots of salvation halting at your door, while those visit you who are more than con querors, and those who are kings and queens unto God forever. s ! i I
