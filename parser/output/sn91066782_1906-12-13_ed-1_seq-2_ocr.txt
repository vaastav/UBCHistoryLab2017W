ASSAILS ROOSEVELT. . Senator Rayner of Maryland Directs His Shafts of Sarcasm at President." Washington, Dec. 13. With incisive sarcasm lidor Rayner of Maryland, on the floor of the Senate yesterday after noon, asoiled the President's attitude toward the controversy now raging on the Pacific coast with" reference to the segregation of the Japanese in the public fchorils of San Francisco. . , The text of the senator's speech wa the resolution, on the subject which h introduced at the opening of the present session of C'ongres. P.eferring to the veiled threat in the President's message to use the military and naval forces of the I'nited States, if necessary, Mr. Rayner said; "It bt very imKirtnt that we should know whether the President hits any Hver in the premises, because it is fjitite a serioim matter,, in .view of the great calamity that haw" lately befallen the city of San Francisco, for the President to contemplate the bombarding of the city at this time, and to declare war against the boards of county school trus tees of California if there is no justifica tion or pretext tion which Such fer. cions proceedings can be undertaken. "The : President is exert' isinr a grei many fimetion executive, ' lesfiidittive and judicial, lawful and unlawful, con stitutional and unconstitutional.. If he in' possessed of. the. idea that be jxthe supervisor of all the public whooU of the various" states of the union, we must either disabtii-e his niiml of this fancy or we must let him know that we agree with him as to the omnipotence of his jurisdiction." - The senator contended that if the President could eonfpel the people of San Francisco to admit Japanese to the schools, be could, with equal propriety, demand the admission of the negro chil dren of Santo Domingo into Ihe white schools of South Carolina. Senator Rayner laid down two propo sitions: - ' "First, that there is no provision what ever in the treaty with Japan that con fers the right that the President speak of or gives to the government of Japan the privileges that it claims in connec tion with the public school system of California or of any other state. "Second, if there was such a provi sion in this treaty, or any other treaty conferring this rights the treaty would be void and without any authority usvn the part of the United States to make it, and in violation of tha constitution and the treaty-making power , of t he government." .1
