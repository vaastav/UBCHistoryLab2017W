The plan proposed by Secretary Phelps for the reorganization of tho chamber of Bommeree is .good or bad accord. 115 to the Kirpost- for which the body is to be re organized. If it is tho intention to make it a close -ration for the single purpose of putting a lew wealthy individual- on the inside of speculating schemes, after the fashion of soui_ of the stock exchanges in other cities, then the plan Is admirably suited to the purpose. ii' it is the inten tion to have the amber of commerce maintain its present position of pop ularity and to continue to exert a wise and healthful inOiiehcc in promoting the gen eral welfare, then the proposed plan would hardly accomplish the purposes in view. The time may come when membership in the chamber of commerce will be worth S*>oo. but it hasn't reached that point yet. The chamber •done, and is still doing, most excellent work in aiding in the devel opment of the city. its work is appreciated by the people, and, consequently, it exerts a powerful influence. It would be a mis- take at this crisis in our development to do anything that would tend to cripple its in- llucnce or impair the efficiency of the body. The greatest need of the body at this time is the infusion of more young Mood in its directory and more activity in its member ship. The plan proposed by Secretary Phelps would not have a tendency to en courage ei;her. _ 1 

DANGEROUS ICE. DANGE3OD3 ICE. Notwithstanding the publication of the ordinance forbidding the sale of ice cut from the Mississippi river, it seems that for a week past cutting has been going on vig orously. The ice thus obtained is of the most dangerous quality. Infected as it is •with the sewage of two great cities, it con tains the seeds of disease, and its use dur ing the summer months might at any time be attended with a pestilence. Long ago a prohibition should have been put upon ob taining ice from the river, but now that the health department fully realizes the possi ble injury that might result, it is moving with commendable promptness and vigi lance. Proceedings will be taken against those who have been cutting the con- demned ice and a test case will be made of the matter. An enlightened public opinion should firmly sustain the department, which of course is acting solely for the public good. In a state like Minnesota, which contains such an abundance of lakes with water absolutely pure, there should bo no excuse for using river ice. even if the latter is only suspected of being tainted, in- stead of being, as in the present case, cer tainly impure.

PATTI? St. Paul can hear Patti for at least one right during the present season if the peo ple want to pay handsomely for the privi lege. It is simply a question whether they are willing to pay the admittedly exor bitant price which she demands, and which lor a sirgle night is said to be 000. There is no question about her willingness to come to St. Paul and Minneapolis if her terms are complied with. She has come to this country after money and will go wherever she can get it. That is the prac tical side of the question. On the other hand it must be considered that this is Patti's last season in America; that she is the greatest living singer, if nut the most Incomparable one that ever lived, and finally this is probably the last opportunity that the vast majority of the people of St Paul will have for heal ins her. Whether their anxiety leaches up to the limit of S'*,oo. could easily be determined by means of a sub scription list. It might even be that through the co-operation ot the two cities Patti's manager would be willing to grant terms, am! thus render the success of a Patti night assured. The effort is at least worth the making, and it will do no harm to open up a correspondence upon the sub- ject with Patti's manager, who is now in Chicago. ■ THE 

CTTLLOM AND .GAR BILLS. A correspondent asks the Globe to state lhe difference between the Cullom and Reagan interstate commerce bills, which in the opinion of the Glove is preferable. and what distinctive features of each are embodied in the new bill recently agreed upon by the conference committee. Both the Cullom and Rea gax bills pro- pose to control railroad transportation and regulate railroad tariff rates by national authority. The Cullom bill provides for the creation of a railway commission. The Reagan bill does not. The Reagan bill prohibits rebates and drawbacks, while the Cullom bill only prohibits giving any advantage by such de vice*. The P.!-: an* bill prohibits pooling, while the Cullom bill leaves that feature to the reports of the future commission and the action of future legislators. The Reagan bill prohibits a higher charge for a short haul than a long one. . The bill agreed upon by the conference committee follows the CniXOX idea of cre ating a commission, and adds to it the Rea gan* feature of prohibiting a higher charge tor a short haul than a long one. The question propounded as to which of the two bills, the Cullom or the Reagan*, is pref erable, opens up for discussion the whole railroad problem. The field is too large to be invaded in this connection. When we say to our correspondent that the railway Corporations are unanimously in favor of fthe Cullom bill, he can. perhaps, draw [his own conclusion as to which one draw is own -oodasion as to which one of tha j ills is to be preferred by the people. It is \ line to the railway corporations to say that j [if left to their decision in the mutter congress j would not pass any sort of an Interstate \ fcommerce bid. They prefer the Cud lorn i pill in the sense that it presents to them a choice of evils. The feature of the Cullom pill which is most attractive to the corpora- ; tions is that which provides for the creation j of a railway eon-miss And it will be -hs_rvert that ihe ; o.:*ci_.ic. committee bad , . i respect enough for the wishes of the corpo- i radon- to retain this feature. Hie experi- j ence that railway companies have had in j testing tbe respective powers of official in- | dependence and corporate influence has not inspired them with the tear that any com- I mission will be too active or too powerful | for them to control The history of rail- j way commissions in this country up to date j justifies the belief in the public u.*u_ that | they are more liable to beconu the toots ■ than the tyrants of corporations.- At all events, a railway commission. like a petit jury, is a very uncertain quantity, and the railway managers are willing to take chances on it. With this simp! i statement of facts we leave, the question with our cor respondent to decide for himself which of the two bills is preferable. THE TELEOIt.I'n COMBINATION. It is to be hoped that here is no truth in the rumored combination between the West ern Union and Baltimore A Ohio Telegraph ! companies. It must be admitted, however, that it looks very much as thnigh an ar rangement is either in contempt; don or has been perfected between the quoi: lam rivals. For many years the officials of the Balti more & Ohio company have loudly asserted their intention to run their business on an entirely independent basis and to tight the Western Union, with its extorti mate rates. to the bitter end. The effort had already been attended with such excellent success that the people, and especially those who have been sufferers from the older company's monopolistic methods, fervently hoped that it would continue m the good work. In scores of instances the Western Union had b-en compiled to grant lower rates and better service through the vigorous competition of .the Garrett company. The latter, backed as it is with practically un limited capital, seemed about to secure for the country a telegraphic service of the highest order at a reasonable cost. But it the pooling arrangement goes into effect th.' matter will be quite different Trices will be maintained, aud ba the service ever so bad no redress can be obtained. That this will be a calam.ty of no mean order the painful experience of St. Paul and Minneapolis with the Western Union can bear ample testimony. The only hone, if the combination is actually made, wiil be in the organization and cordial support of an entirely new company, and it is certainly a short-sighted policy on the part of the Bal timore A Ohio which thus carries it beyond the reach of practical public, sympathy which was so ready to be extended to it. PECULIAR ADVERTISING. There are all sorts of tricks in all sorts of trades, but it takes the average theatrical manager to devise the most unique schemes tor advertising his show. Formerly it was the plan to have the star actress lose a $50, --000 diamond necklace, or the principal actor to narrowly escape drowning while bathing at some popular seashore resort. When that scheme had been worked to the limit the scandal dodge took its place. Since Violet Cameron's notable failure in that direction other advertising devices had to be resorted to. Recently an opera manager failed to get an advertisement in this city by quarreling with his prima donna, al though he has had better success in other quarters. But the most unique advertis ing scheme of ail is that adopted by the managers of the National Opera company, who are quarreling with the preachers over the religious feat ures of the ballet. The St. Louis preachers were dumps enough to fall into the trap that the opera managers laid for them, and gave the show an adveitisement that was worth several thousand dollars to the proprietors. Having made such a brill iant success with their advertising trick in St. Louis, the opera man age.- are trying it in (Jhica_o. The Chicago clergymen, with their wives and sweethearts, have been invite I to oc cupy front rows at the opening engagement of the National Opera company in Chicago to-night, and in addition thereto are re quested, after witnessing the performance. to give a candid statement of their opinions respecting the moral, artistic and religious features of the ballet. Although a free ticket to a big show is a great temptation. it is not fair to assume that all the Chicago clergymen are going to be enticed into wit nessing the ballet performance, but it would i be contrary to the traditions of the Chicago pulpit if some of them didn't suck at the bait. There is a very loose system of the ology In Chicago at best, and it would be an easy matter to name a half dozen Chicago preachers who would uot object to witness ing a ballet even if it did afford an opportu nity to study art or afford a text for a moral or religions dissertation. Conse quently the churches in that city will be crowded next Sunday by people anxious to learn the pulpit verdict on ballets, and the National Opera company will be several thousand dollars more iv pocket. TOO M VNY OF THEM. A New York exchange complains that the senate has too many "business men." There is something in the complaint A degree of statesmanship not ordinarily possessed by "business men.*" is an essen tial qualification in a senator. When a sen ator is found who combines both qualifica tions, who is both a statesman an i a busi ness man. he generally makes his mark. But. unfortunately for the country, there are not many senators making marks in these degenerate days. THE POPULAR STYLE. Ihe New York Sun complains that the president's message is not picturesque enough. The Sun is an excellent newspa per, but it is entirely too aesthetic for this day and generation. It is good horse sense and not picturesqueness in state craft that the people crave. And the president is suiting the public taste most admirably. The Republicans in the Minnesota legisla ture might do much worse than combine with the Democrats Cor the purpose ot Bending a professor of the latter faith to the senate. There are also several very able. Democrats who would represent the state with exceeding credit.

She said no word;, she did not praise nor blame me; She is so proud, so proud and cold and fair! Ah! dear, my love, thy silence did uot shame me. As we went down the stair. Thy dark eves flashed, thy regal robes ar- rayed thee In queenly grace and pride beyond com- pare; But ou thy cheeks a sudden red betrayed thee. As we went down the stair. O, lady mine, some near night will I prove thee! By this soft glove I know that I mar dare Take thy white hand and whisper, "Sweet, I love thee," As we go down the stair! This is clever poetry, and we have no wish to dispute it. But why should a girl, and a girl of experience evidently as well as Of genius, write thus in the character of a man? It is true she is not alone in this .sort of thing. There are a good many girls— and before she got married Airs. Ella Wheeler Wilcox was one of them — in whose poems the utterances of manly passion flow along with bewitching warmth and sweetest m.lody. It is a strange puzzle, but we reject utterly the idea that the girls write in this way because there is no man who will write lor them. George Gould'- J_tu_iiie-_-i.ike Life. Chicago Mail. George Gould is the latest instance of his father's foresight. His first experience in business convinced every one else that he was not cutout. But Jay Gould bas picked him out as bis manager. Young Gould has now settled down to make himself stoop- shouldered signing checks and indorsing stocks and bonds. He has been made vice president of a number of corporations b> his father to relieve the latter of that task. When he thought of taking a bride 'the first marked change came over him. Even his father did not know what developed tbe young man's business capacity so suddenly. Cupid had winged him, and ho was impressed with the gravity of life. He was married in a business suit, and his wedding trip was in a common coach from Irvington to New York. The young man is daily at his father's t.ffl -c. He takes his' coat off and works iv his snirt sleeves, like a clerk who has plenty to do and wants to be unrestrained in doing it. He reaches his office in the Western Union build- ing by 9or '.':3 d and often stay's right up to 6 o'clock. He pores over the units of rail- roads to see • that they are right before pay- ment is made, and looks after details that put him in the way of knowing exactly what everybody connected with the property is doing. Now and then, on a bright afternoon, he manages to get away from business to j tike his wife for a drive. His spare time is passed entirely in her society. Tiie Diagram is Lost. Chicago Tribune.

TEAMPS' LYCEUM. strange ones, although the majority were familiar to the police officers, they having been regular annual visitors at the station for several years. The evening had been fixed upon as the one for reorganizing the tramps' lyceum, which was adjourned early last spring to give the members an oppor tunity to circulate through the country dur ing the rammer months. Windgall Blatz ' was present, looking a tiille older than when he pounded the head of the presidential barrel and adjourned the lyceum last spring. He had allowed his whiskers to grow and his face looked like the central block in a crazy quilt. He had had bad luck, he said. since leaving for the summer's outing, and had failed to discover a nocturnal clothes line in all his travels. Consequently he had come back to the lyceum shirtless, but wrapped artistically around his shoulders he wore a dark brown coffee sack, cut diagonally across the breast with a tack hammer, pinned together with four-year old safety pins' and ten- penny nails. His trowsers had evidently been made for a man that wasn't built his way. and they were torn in several piaces. His feet were too delicate to be worn inside of stiff leather shoes, and they were wrapped in strips of cloth that were fast ened to his trowsers legs. over all being a little ulster that looked like a map of Minnesota. The buttons had long since dropped Horn this ulster, and when drawn tightly around the wearer it was fastened with three spikes. Around his waist he wore a sash made of tarred rope that he watched with the closest vigilance. as it was the relic of a Montana lynching party in which lie had been the central figure at the request of several hundred citizens whose personal property he had become* somewhat familiar with. The history of this event will be told later on. On the top of bis head he wore the beautiful wreck of what, was once, a Gainsborough hat. The left side was burnt off. while the right side had been torn away from the crown by the ruthless hand of some covetous man who begrudged Blatz the possession of it. The top of the crown had been removed to give his hair a chance to grow upwards towards the clouds, a privilege that it bad taken great advantage of. Long had he worn the hat without removing it, his hair had grown through the. top and hung down over the sides, which gave his head the ap pearance of a hanging not filled with some strange, creeping plant of luxuriant growth. "This prevents the win from re moving my hat, and saves me good many bends ay ther back ter pick it tip," said Blatz when his friends made remarks re garding the appearance of his head. To night Blatz sat behind the presidential bar rel, his hand lying listlessly on the ax handle with which he had often bruised the bulging sides of the barrel. He was in full dress, and seemed to be in a thoughtful mood, "I'll bet er million dollars to er cent thet Blatz hez hed ter split er cord ov wood fur his breakfust, an' is grievin' over it," whis pered Omaha Bob to Keaehforit Jones. "You've got ther slnch on rue." replied Jones, expectorating on the stovepipe. Keaehforit Jones was a new comer among the boys. This was his first night with them. lie had come from the South. He had left New Orleans four weeks before. and by dint of freight trains and easy walk ing had just arrived in St. PauL He was a member of the Southern branch of the Na tional Tramps' Protective association, and had, at one time, held the office of secre tary of that, society, but as he was obliged to hire a man who knew how to write to keep the. records, he was forced to resign after he had been sued two or three times by his employe for salary that Jones had promised to pay him. lie was a philosophical sort of an indivi dual; and claimed that lie never would have been a tramp if he hadn't spent his early days in trying to discover the principles of perpetual motion. He had made several machines that he thought would solve the mystery, but they all proved failures, and he was now devoting himself to deep study of the subject, and expected to astonish the world some day with a realization of his dream. He was a peculiar man in dress as well as in manners, and as he sat that night crooked up on the floor in the shadows, with his pale face and restless eyes shining like the frontispiece of a hobgoblin, he formed a very grotesvue figure. His face and hands were as dean as water and soap could make them, and his raiment was a peculiar com bination. On his shock of black, wiry hair was a hat of strong pasteboard running- up into the air two feet and terminating in a sharp point. This peculiar head dress was orna mented with rough sketches drawn in char coal of pieces of machinery that the crazy brain under it had dreamed out. The hat was held to his head by a strip of blue cloth that passed under the chin, and was fastened to tlie other side with a button. He wore a full-dress coat, rather rusty and somewhat fagged, ornamented with "brass buttons. This coat was fastened tightly about him, and over his left shoulder and across his bieast was hung a broad leather sash, and from the end resting on his right hip hung an old-fashioned six-shooting re volver, generally styled "pepper-box." This was a perfectly harmless weapon, as the hammer was missing, but it lent the wearer the air of a military officer of great honor. His long, boney legs were incased in black trousers badly worn at the knees, which fitted him almost as closely as his skin and on his feet were shoes with sharp points, through which his narrow toes had worked theii way. He took but little interest in tin proceedings, but kept his glittering eyes on the floor while he nervously moved his hands about and worked his skinny fingers. It was nearly 9 o'clock when President Blatz rapped the lyceum to order. Hang ing his hat up on the floor, he glanced along the semi-circle of faces and, taking a long breath, said: "Boyees. we hey essemb'ed onct more after er year's separation. Er year in which we hey experienced er mixed up mess ov fun an' trouble. Many ov us hey cum back feelin' thet we hey been benerfiited by ther summer's experience; others hey returned wuss off than they wus when this air lyceum adjurned ur one year ergo. As Shakespeare has frequently remarked, * 'tis true, 'tis tuff, and tuff it is. 'tis true.' 1 notice thet several faces which were familiar among us last year air not here to-night. 1 regret this very much, but they may turn up afore ther winter's over. This air lyceum wus er great benerfit to us last winter, an' we want ter keep up its repurta tion this seasun. My term az piesurdent ov this lyceum expires to-night an' we must reor.ernize. Boyees. ver now hey ther privilege ov nominatin* somebody fur presurdent of this air lyceum fur ther insuin' year. Who do yer want?" Cross-eyed Sam arose and said: "Gen tlemen, 1 move thet ther present officers ov this lyceum hold over ernother year." "Second ther motion." yelled Oman Bob. HE tramps room at the police sta ti on last Wednes day night presented a n untisu ally in teresting sight. A large num ber of t h c tram ping fraternity were pres ent, and there were several of the faces "But i protest," said Blatz. rising. "Set down, yer chump, or I'll break yer neck with er shoe." yelled Cross-eyed Sam. and * turning to the men he said, "ther motion he been made an' seconded thet ther present orgun- » ization be continued.^ All them who be in' favor oy this motion say so." "So."' "Yon bet!" "I!" "Thet's ther stuff!" and various other favorable remarks were made, mid it was unanimously de- clared that the present officers should hold over another year. Blatz attempted to rise. ""Set down, yer chump," yelled Sam. "Don't yer-ypea yer head. We've erlected yer an' we're proud ovyer. darn yer hide, an' we don't want no kickiiv out ov yer." "I jist wanted ter thank yer for tho honor," said Blatz. sinking back on the nail keg. •-Ob, all right, thet goes," said Sam, "fire ahead." Blatz thanked the lyceum for the honor it had conferred on him. and said Clothes- line Williams and Pensive Pete would be expected to tell their experience while abroad, next \Y ednesday n ght. He then adjourned the lyceum one week, and the boys, placing their shoes under their heads, stretched themselves out on the floor and scratched themselves to sleep. Capture of a Great Salmon. London Morning Post. Mr. Arthur Pryor of Hylands, Chelms- ford, sends the following interesting ac- count of the capture of a fifty-seven and a half pound Tweed salmon: On Wednesday last my host the Duke oi Roxburgh allotted to me for the day the upper water at Floors. I had a very fine day's sport, having up to 4 o'clock landed fourteen fish, weighing from eight to thirty pounds. The last fish broke my favorite fly, and I replaced it with one of For- rest's tying called the "Wilkinson." I then hooked what I felt to be a heavy fish, which took all my strength to hold (with one of the best 18 foot 6 inch rods Forrest ever made). After trying all he knew to get rid of the hook up and down the "shot." stream, he went down through the rocks in safety. Here he slopped behind the. big stones, and no power I was master of could move him till I got a pull at him down stream. I then had had hold of him for half an hour, and my arms ached pain- fully. The fish then went stream. I bad to jump out of the boat, when the duke, duchess and my daughter appeared. "You must get to the top of the bank." were the orders of my attendant. "How i can I and hold on both hands to the fish*"' The duke saw the fix 1 was in and came and partly lifted me up: all safe for tho present. Down stream went the fish into the "slap" and there lay up again. We all now thought it was a big fish •'•foul hooked," and the duke advised a steady pull down stream, which, being resorted to, the fish came through the "slap" and for the first time rushed up to the surface and made the water boil. He then came slowly toward my side of the river, and the fisherman slipped into the water below me and the magnificent fish floated tail first into the lauding net. after an hour's hard struggle. He was fairly hooked. ma White House Cooking. New York World. The cooking of cabbage in the White house during the president's reception hours is the latest thing complained of by the fas- tidious Washington fans. Cabbage is not held by the scientists to be a desirable escu- lent, but it commends itself to hardy, mus cular people, who possess palates that have not been spoiled by high living. The aroma of boiling cabbage mingled with the odor of chrysanthemums is something new in social circles, and we are not prepared to speak of tin! combination as a promoter of appetite or as an attraction for official levees. Fash- ion has a great deal to do with these things, however. n«- D2-X- OAK V\'n l»i;j_ VIM.. _________ I don'd vas preaching voman's righdta. I don'd vas preaching rowan's righdta.
