The President's Message. President's message rings with Americanism and is characteristic of the man. who typifies the true American citizen. In it is found all that fear lessness of thought and action for which the President of the United'States is noted. His ideas are clear and he couches tbem in language that ctnnot be misunderstood or falsely interpreted. It is the proauct of great intellectuality and high est purity of heart. With a knowledge of Koose ?elt. his life, his history, uoone will deny the sin cerity of his utterances, his honesty of purpose, and bis determination to execute faithfully his pledges. This message, his first, was awaited by the people of the nation, iriespective of political creeid, with eagerness. Statesmen of both parties paid profound attention to its reading and were deeply impressed with the great scholarship and grand statesmanship, with which it was featured. Possibly, not in several decades of the nation's history has the reading of the President's mes sage commanded such universiul attention of the federal legislative bodies, and never a more' popu lar reception. The journals of the country with very few exceptions, are loud in their praises. All who have read it are pleased and pronounce it an encyclopaedia, worthy of the careful study of the law makers of the land. On the matter of capital and labor be does not surrender himself to demagogical. as so often is the case 'o prejudice the people and create strife, but exercises a judicious conservatism aud sug gests such regulations as will not weaken the prosperity of the country, but on the other hand will be a protection ot mutual benefit to both classes. lie is pronounced on the matter of an archy and proposes treasures congress will do well to take up and make law. On all party policies he is happily orthodox, but not so radically pronounced as to put himself under the ban of subserveince to party regularity. He shows himself to be a republic to in the truest sense and not muswumpship as designing partisan d m lcratic press has bien bo diligently trying to convince the people he would be. The message is wholesoni" mid replete wiili the spirit of Americanism, and lev is no shadow of doubt as to the high character of administration the chief executive will give in the futu-e. Roosevelt On The "Trusts." Tb'o President has spoken on the so called ??trusts," and suggests a certain remedy for ih? baneful effects they may have on the i"dus'riil conditions ot the country, provided they are alio* od to run uncurbed. He has not taken no ihe demagogic hue and cry against them that has been so often set up agaitfst combinations of capital but bandies the subject from the point of reason, able objection to improper combinations whose object nmy be to monopolize certain 'ines of indus ry. In this particular he asks for regulations which, upon theirface. seem wise ami not detri mental to capital, but at the same lime beneficial to labor. Over-capitalization inspites a lack of confidence and may work th edestruction of the in dustrial fabric of tbe country, and permit of an illegitimate conduct of the business of a concern. Toe President would regulate thin condition or at least meet and prevent it by/publicity?"that is a public knowledge of the working capital of tbe concern and so much of its affairs as will Induce confidence." He is also right In his claim that they sbould be under national supervision, and. very properly suggests that there be an amendment to tbe constitution, if tbe subject be not now cdvored by tbe constitution- Tbe claim has been advanced 'that they are itate creations and can only be look ed after by the states. If this be true, no end of mischief might result, and it would be well to have tbe amendent he suggests, and in that event, tbe proper thing to do, as he suggests, is the creation of a new cabinet department, to look after the com merce and industries of the country. The president's message on this subject wi'l inspire the confidence of both capital and Iab->r and especially of all, who are honest in their eDdc iv r to make a hving and develop tho.country. Ciuj binations of capital can have no reasonable objec tion to such a regulated conduct of tbeir concern as will iuBure them proper returns on theL- inves ? merits and reward for their e(T >rts. Oa tho uth? r band tbe laboring mao, whose welfare i? Ur. in dependent upon thesucce6s of capital, can not - ject to such regulations as will be of advantage to himself as well as tbe capitalist. There vili beno upheaval along this line to startle the country ar,.i throw the nation into the air of panic and distrut. , so long as the executive head of the government treats the subject in this fashion and so long as congress stays within.rational bounds 111 its act.ou upon this subject. No Tariff Tinkering. The President wants no taritr tinkering and, as claimed some months ago by the Telegram, j there is not likely to be any, as tbe republicans in congress are practically uni'ed aeaiost such a procedure, beyond what may be absolutely nrces sary as to tbe Philippine Islands owing to a recent decision of tbe United Stat'es supreme court. whi.-Ii declares the recent collection of duties in tbV p r ticular unconstitutional. Like his illustrious predecessor, President McKinley. Roosevelt ad vances the ideaof reciprocity, when it will Lot inter fere with the nutu-ingof of our home industries .and when there will be 110 weakening of pr > tection to American labor. botiieW the treaties now pending, he b-ltev-^ would be de'rimer-nl to our nation's com ner id ir ovt i mi.I iiuin ' i.ii activity if ratified and uti does uut li M<a'e .? ow gest in a respectful manner the neco-i y i f ?mrti fying or rejecting - hem. Wh'le n siroriif c.h ? mi>i<>n of protection, he ii i.<-r ?? ..\t cm i n?.- ?? . ject and does not attempt to say ibat uur present prosperity is due alone to the tariff. He does, however, recognize its etficajy in the buildicg up and progress of the nation, and does not wish to see certain clauses and schedules tampered with, as such* action would tend to throw the country into a state of disquietude of mind and would in spire a lack ot confidence throughout tbe buci'iess and financial circles of the country. He recom mends such reciprocity treaties as will widen and strengthen our foreign trade, but not any such as would leave us a defensless home martcet and I bring degradation to the- labor of the oauntry. Reciprocity along these lines will no douot prove advantageous His utterences upon the tariff and reciprocity are a strong confirmation of his purpose to carry out that memorable pledge he made to the nation "to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of President J/cKinley for the peace and'prosperity and honor of our beloved country." The President's message was given to the news^ tp rs tu keep until it bad been read in cor t?ra-s. Wore thev should publish. They all held his cui'tideiiCH, and he did them a good turn, thus saving th m de ay and inconvenience. The plan was strictly original and furnishes a hippy preced ent for others. There are some, though they are believed to be quite few, who will not hive thought much about tbe message, until Bryan tells what he thinks ot it and its meaning. Tneu they *411 tell you wnai th-y think atmut it. President Roosevelt very <ci<n. ly received .-everal Uarisoncounty citizens toi-i w ek and re marked that he had a very warm s jjt in his heart for West Virginians. That feeling is reciprocal and West Vireiniaus are just as proud of him as the people of his own native state. The Telegram desires to start ofT with the new year with the business of the office brought up to-date, and will appreciate the settlement- in full of all subscription a year or more in arrearges. 

THIRTEEN DOCTORS FAILED. Mrs. M. A. Close, of Nebraska, Was Cured of Incipient Consumption After All Medical Aid Had Failed?Read Iler Letter. MRS. M. A. CLOSE. Kearney, Neb,, July 8,1900. Dr. S. D. tlartman, ColumbuM, Ohio: ? Dear Doctor-'-"I desire to express to you my sincere thanks tor the In terest you have shown In my case, and for the timely aid and advice which has effected a curs of as bad a case of consumption as could be weft Imagined. 44Peruna and Manalln have done what thirteen of the be it physicians In the country have failed to do. For more than three years / doctored for consumption, and spent thirteen weeks In a Pulmonary Sanitarium at Milwaukee, Wis.; but finding myself growing worse, as a last resort, 1 came West when / was bedfast for many weeks, and the physicians which my husband called gave no hope but said, ?She cannot possibly live more than a few days.9 But thanks to Peruna, f fooled them all. In an Incredibly short time after / began to take Peruna the hemorrhages stopped. 1 began to mend slowly at first, but the Improvement became more marked, and now / can truthfully say that there Is not the slightest trace of my old complaint. 441 would have written you a long time ago, but have purposely waited to , i'th? ef.'sct was lasting; rnd /;?conclusion I would say, God bless you and keep you v.-lth us that you may go ai with your work of mercy fdr many years tjc~uic."?rins. M. A. CLOSE. P. S.?4' I am going to visit f/hnds In Wisconsin who never expected to ( - re . a:. -?/- i, ~use i*r *uiJ mail to me at 579 Pacific street, Appleton, ?/Is*"?-AI. A* i FOUND HERSELF CROWING WORSE. AN OLD COLP Is Catarrh, and Catarrh to Consumption. The tendency of catarrh of the is to ptM downward through the chial tube* to the lunge. Any one who hu had catarrh of the head for a ye more find* the disease gradually greasing downward. Im eome oaae progreee ia rapid, and ia other oaeeellie slow; but sooner or lattv M oatarrh la allowed to run, it will 90 fe the lunge and set up the disease heown ae con sumption. It is doubtful if eensumptio is ever caused by anything except tarrh. The catarrh usually begins as a cold in the head or throat, and is neglected until it becomes chronic; then it begins to dawn on the victim that he has cataxrhu Unless he ip very foolish indeed he will not rest easy until the catarrhis entirely cured. Thousand* pay no,attention to it until it is too late. Mrs. J. Priest, Lee, Mich., writes"I think there is no medicino on earth that excel Is Peruna. My husband won't take any other. We have tested it and it worked a great change in my son'* health last spring when we thought he was going into consumption.' We gave him only one bottle and he was all right. I tell everybody about how much good it has dono us. My husband says he oan't do without it. As for myself, it saved me seven years ago from going blind. I could not see to read one word for six weeks. I thought I should surely lose my sight. I commenced taking Pe runa and by the time I had taken one bottle I could see to road as well as ever. Wo think it is a grand medicine."?Mrs. J. Priest. Dm aa Much as Needed. If Peruna is used a cold never be comes chronic, and hence catarrh is pre vented. But after i catarrh has be come thoroughly established Peru na will cure it, but it will take much longer. Even in cases where catarrh has attacked the lungs and the pymptoms of con sumption have shown them selves, the Peru na will cure. A great many cases of genuine con sumption h a v o been cured with Peruna after the patient had been given up to die, as in the case of Mrs. Close. If you do not derive prompt and aatle factorv results from the use of Peruna, write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full statement of your case and he will be pleased to give you his valuable ad- . vice gratis. Address Dr. Hartman, President of The Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus, (X Hits Corlnne Gil more, 108 Vance SL, Memphis, Tenn., uses Peruna for oolda and catarrh.
