The necessity of a national life built up- er- the bread basis of universal freedom and intelligence is recognized as the only collation to the problem of permanent peace and prosperity in the years to come. To those crafty politicians in the North who would patch up some hollow trace of peace whereby human slavery may be yet sustained, he offers no word of encourage ment.

THIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN. PRESIDENT LINCOLN. Delivered Wednesday, December 9, 1863. Fellov citzens of the Senatt ani Bomu of Rrpraentauttt : FOREIGN RELATIONS. Another year of health and of suffi ciently abundant harvests has passed. for these, and especially for the im proved condition of our national affairs, ur renewed and profound gratitude to God is due. We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers. Toe er forts of disloyal eittsens of the United States to involve us in foreign wars to aid n 'he inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing. Her Britanic Majesty's Gov eminent, as was justly expected, hive ex ereieed their authority to prevent the de oarture of new hostile expeditions from British porta. The Emperor of France hap, ny a like proceeding, promptly mdioaiea the neutrality whioh he proclaimed at the beiianinc of the contest. Uaestions or great intricacy and import ance have arisen out of the blockade and other belligerent operations, between the Government and several of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and. so far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness, justice and mutual rood will, ins especially gratifying that our prize courts, by ths impartiality of their adjudication, have commanded ths respect and confidence of maritime powers. The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 17th day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execu don. It is believed that so far at imerican ports and American citi zens are concerned, that inhuman and oarbarous traffic has been brought to an nd. I shall submit for the consideration f the Senate, a Convention for the ad- iustmeatof possessory claims in Washing ton Territory, arising out of the treaty f the 15th of June, 1816, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some uUauiet among the citizens of that oow rapidly improving part of the country. A novel and important question involving the extent of mar .time jurisdiction of Spain in the waters whioh surround the Island of Cuba naa beeu debated without reaching an atrreement and it is proposed, in an ami- cable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a frieodlv power. A communication 'or that ptirpase will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought it propar, subject o the arproval of the Senate, to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation jf the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to ihe impes's upon navigation in the waters of Denmark. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili, touching the seizure at Silana in Peru by Chillian officers of a large amount in treasure, be longing to the eitizsos of the United States, has been brought to a olose by the award of his Mijesty, the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the ques lion was referred by the parlies. The subject was thoroughly and patiently ex amined by that justly respected magistrate, and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as ibev expected there is no reason to dis tinat th. wiidnm of hie Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly oomplied with by Chill when intelligence in regard to it reached that country. The joint commission under the act of the last session for carrying into effect the Convention with Peru on the subject t claims has been organized at Lima, and a engaged in the business entrutedto it. Difficulties concerning inter-oeeanlo transit through Mcaragua are in course of ami cable adjustment, in conformity with the principles set forth in my last annual mes sage. I have received a representative from the United states or Columbia, and have credited a minister to that Republic. Incidents occurring in the progress of our oi Til war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of the international question touohing the rights of foreigners in this country, and or united Mates out sens abroad. In regard to some govern. meets these rights are at least partially defined by trestles. In no in itanoe, however, la it expressly stipulated that in the instance of civil war, a foreigner resiling tn this country, within the lines of the insurgents, is to be exempted from the rule which olasses iim as a belligerent in whose behalf the Government of his country cannot express ny privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and in some instances in behalf of for- oiguers who have lived In the United States the greater part of their lives. 

FOREIGNERS EVADING MILITARY SERVICE. There Is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign ooantries, who have declared their intentions to become oiuiens, or who have been fully natural ized, have evaded the military duty re quired of them by denying the fact, there oy throwing upon the Government the ourden of proof. It has been found diffi cult and impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the Clerks of oourts where declarations of intention may be made or naturalization effected, to send periodically the lists of the names of per sons saturated by declaring their inten tions to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in whoee department these names must be arranged and presented for general information. There Is also reasaa to believe that for eigners frequently become eitif ens of the United States for the sole purpose of evad ing the duties imposed by the laws of their native country, to which, on becoming na turalized here, they at ones repair, and though never returning to the United States, they Btiil claim the interposition of the Government as citizens Many alter cation end great prrjodiofs have hereto fore arisen oui of th s abuse. It it, there fore, submitted to your serieus considera tion. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of the United States, residing abroad, may claim the in terposition of his Government. The right of suffrage has often been assumed and ex ercised by aliens finder pretence of natur alization, which they hays disavowed when drafted into the military servite. I submit the expediency of such a amendment of the laws as will make the faot o voting an estoppel sgainst any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on grounds of alien- In common with other Western Powers our rotations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition of tlie hereditary aristocracy of the Empire, to the enlightened and libe ral policy of the Tyooon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations, it is to be hoped, although got with entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome. I aBk your attention to the minister residing there for the dama ges hs sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Vedjo. INTERNATIONAL AND SEABOARD TELEGRAPH. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which it is believed will result in effecting a con tinuous line of telegraph through that Empire from our Pacifio coast. I recom mend to your favorable consideration the subject of an International telegraph across the Atlantic ocean, and also of ttelegrrph between' this oapital and the national lorts along tne Atlantic ceaooara and the Gulf of Mexico. Such connec tions established with any reasonable out lay would be convenient as well as effec tive aids to diplomatic, military and naval OUR MINISTERS AND CONSULS. The consular systems of the United States, nnder the enactments of the last Congress, begin to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope t' at it may be come entirely so with the increase of trade which, will ensue whenever peaoe u restored. Our Ministers aoroad have been faithful in defending American rights, in protesting our commercial In terests, uur uonsuis nave necessarily had to encounter inoreased labors and re sponsibilities, growing oat of the war. These they have for the most part met and discharged with seel and effifienoy. This acknowledgement just includes those Con suls who, residing in Morocco, igypt, China, and other central countries, are charged with complications and extraordi nary powers. The condition of the several organized territories is generally satisfactory, al though the Indian disturbances In New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. Themineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexioo and Arizona, are prov ing far richer thaa heretofore under stood. 1 lay before you a communication on this subject from the Governor of New FOREIGN IMMIGRATION. I again to your expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement or their migration. Although this source of national wealth is again following with greater freedom than for several years before the insur rection occurred, there is still a great de ficiency of laborers in every field of indus try, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of pre cious metals, while the demand for labor is thus increased here. Tens of thous ands of persons, destitute of remunera tive occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates, and are offering to emigrate to the United States if essen tial, but very cheap assistance can be af forded them. It is easy to see that under the sharp discipline of oivil war the na tion la beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to receive the attention and support of the Govern ment. Xojaries uaforseen by the uovern ment, and unintended, may in some oases have been infiioted upon the subjects or oitizens of foreign ooantries. bom at sea and on land, by persons In the service of the United States. As this Government expect redress from other powers when similar injuries are in flicted by persons in their service open ar tisans of the United States. We must be piepsred to do jus ioe to foreigners if the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate. To this purpose a special court may be au thorized, with the power to hear and decide each claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and public law. Conventions for adj usting claims, by your Commissioner, have ben proposed to some governments, but no definite answer to the proposition has been received from any. In the course of the session I shall prob ably have OTOasion to request you to pro vide indemnification to claimant. These decrees of restitution, which have been rendered and damages awarded by the Admiralty Court and in other rases where this Government may be acknowl edged to be liable in prinoipla, and where the amount of that liability lias been as certained by an informal arbitration and the proper officers of ths Treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign Consuls in this country, while each a demand may not be an indi cation of publio law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between the United States end a foreign country. Tee expe diency of so far mollifying the act as to ex empt from tax the inoome of such Consuls as are not citizens of the United states, de rived from the emoluments of their office, or from property not situated in the United States, is submitted to your serious con sideration. I mike this suggestion upon the ground that a country which ought to be reciprocated, exempts our Consuls in all other oouhtries from taxation to the extent that is indicated. The United States think ought not to be declared to be decepuonally illiberal to international tnde and commence. The operations of the treasury daring the past year have been successfully conducted. Ths enactment by Congress of a national banking law has proved a valuable support of the public credit and the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers, and some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws, but no change in their principles or gen eral scope is believed to be needed. Since these measures have been in operat ion, all demands on the Treasury, including the pay of the Army and Navy, have been promptly mat and fully satisfied- No con siderable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided, and more liberally and punctually paid, and it may be added that by no people were the bur dens accident to a great war ever more RECEIPTS. Ths receipts during the year, from all sources, including loaps and bilanoe in Treasury at its commencement were $901, 125,674 86 ; the aggregate disbursements $895 796,30 66, leaving a balance on the 7th of July, 1863, of $5,829,044 21. Of the receipts there were divided, from Cus toms, $69 059,642 40 ; from Internal Rev enue, $37 640,787 95 ; from direct taxes, $l,S5,;03 6t ; from land, $167,617.17 ; from miscellaneous sources, $3,046,615 3i and from loans $77,668 235.157; m thing' the aggregate $'0,112,667,486 ; of th dis bursements, theie were $23,2529 2; for pensions, &c, &e $421,652,059; for Interest in psMjo debt and $2,472,984,651 ; for the War bepartment, 9,929,860,083 ; for the Navy Department, $6,321,110,627; for the payment of funded and temporary debt $1,818 663,507, mak ing the aggregate $89.616 663,065, and leaving a balanoe of $532,904,421. But the payment cf the funded and temporary debt having been z&ade from peonies bor rowed during the year, they mast fcs re garded merely as nominal payments, and the monies borrowed to make them, as merely nominal receipts, and their amount ($18,105,663,507,) should therefore be de ducted both from the receipts and disburs ments ; this being done, there remains as actaal receipts, $71,470,993,558, leaving the balanoe as already stated. SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. J h actual receipts and disbursements for the first qutrtr and the estimated re ceipts and disbursements f,r the remain ing quarters of the current fisoal year of 1864 will be shown in detail by the report pf the Secretary of the Treasury, to whioh l invite yonr attention. It ia not sufficient to say that li is not elievd that the ac tual results will exhibit s state of tap finances less favorable to the country than the estimate of that officer heretofore sub mitted, while it Is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disburse ments and debits will be found very con leas than has been SECRETARY OF WAR. The report pf fie Secretary of War Is a document of great Interest It consists of first the military opera tions of the year, detailed in the report of the General in Chief. H -oond, the organ ization of colored persons into the war service. Third, exchange of prisoners fully set forth in the letter of httchecck. Fourth, operation nnder ths Act for en rolling and calling oat the National for ce, detailed in the report of the Provoet- Marshal-General. Fifth, ths organization of the Invalid Corps. And sixth, the ope ration of the several Departments of the Quartermaster-General, Commissary Gen eral, Paymaster-General, Chief of En gineers, Chief of Ordnance and burgeon-General. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY. It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this Report, except such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content myself in refer ring to yonr attention to'ihe Report itself. The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during theyear, and through out the whole of this unhappy conies', have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success, the extensive blockade has been constantly Increasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded, yet on so long a line it has so far been impossible to en lirelv suppress illicit trade. From the returns received at the Navy Department it appears that more than 1,0 0 vessels have been captured sinoe the block ade was instituted, and that the vaiue of prizes already sent in for adjudioation amount to over $13,000,000. The naval force of the United States consists, at this time, of 6S8 vessels comple'ed and In the course of completion, and of these seventy. five are iron-clad armored steamers. The events of the war gives an increased in terest and importance to the navy which will, probsbly, extend beyond the war itself. The armored vessels in the Navy, com pleted and in service, or which are under contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in number those of any other Power, but while these may be relieJ upon for harbor defense and st a-coast sur vey, others of greater strength and capac ity will beneoessary for cruising purposes, and to maintain our rightful position on the oeean. The change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare, since the introduction of steam as a mo tive power for ships of-war, demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards, or the establish meat of new ones for the construction and necessary repairs of modern war vessels. No iuoonsi lerable embarrassments, do lav and publio injury have been experi enced from the want of such Government establishments and the necessity of such a Navy Yard, bo furnished at some suite ble p!ace upon the Attantio seaboard, has on several repeated ocoisious been brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the report of the Secretary, whioh accompanies this communication. 1 thing it my duly to invite vour special attention to this sub ject and also to that of establishing a yard and Department for Naval purposes upon one of the westers rivers. A naval force has been created on these interior waters and under many disadvantages within a little more than two years ex ceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration, satisfictory and important as has been the performance of the heroio men or tne navy at mis interest ing period, they are soaroely more won derful than the services of our meohanios and artizans in the production of war ves sels which has created a new form of naval 

SEAMEN. any other nation in our resources of iron and timber, with inexhausiable quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all assailable and in close proximity to navigable waters without the advantage of pubuo works. The resources of the na. tion have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a navy of snoh magnitude, which at the very period of its creation rendered signal service to the Union. The increase of the number of seamen in 'he publio service from 7,000 men, In the spring of 1H5I, to 24.UU0 at the present time has been accomplished without especial legislation or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase. It has been found, however, that tha operation of the draft, with high boon ties paid for army recruits, is beginning to a-ect, injuriously, the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be likely to lmpai Its efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the array. J, therefore, respect fully suggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval eervioe by ade. quale provision on this subject, which would, at the same time, be equal to the communities more especially interested I commend to your consideration the sag gestion of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and train iug seamen fr natal service. The Naval Academy is undergoing signal service in preparing midshipmen for hignly respon sible duties, which In after life they will be required to perform on the water. That the country Bhould not be deprived of a proper quota of educated oiHcere, for which legal provision has been made at the Haval School. oe vacanoies caused by this neglect is an occasion to make nomi nations from States in insurrection have filled by the Secretary of tne Navy. The School is now more full end complete than at any previous period, and in every re spect entitled to the iSjVirable consider ticn of Congress. Daiing the put fiscal year the fiaansial condition of the Post Olfioe Department has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am happy in boing able to state that the receipts of postal revenue has nearly equalled tbeentire expenditures, the latter amounting to $1 1,314. UUU.84, and the form er to $11,163,789 9, leaving a deficiency of but $150,467.25. In the year 1860, immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $.55J670,&49, the postal reoeipis of that year being $264,572,219 less than those of 1869. foe decrease since 13')0 in the an nual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent , but the annual ex pendltnre on account of the same has been reduced 35 per cent. It is manifest, there fore, that the Post Office Department may become self sustaining in a fow years, even with the restoration of the whole ser vice. The Internal Conference of Positi Delegates, from the principal countries of i'arope and America, which was called at the suggestion of the Postmaster General, met at faria on the eleventh cr May last, and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles estab lished by the Conference is best adapted to facilitate the postal intercourse between nations, and as the basts of future conven tions luk.ugiiti.te t geperii sustain of uni form international oherges, at reduced rates of tea per oeniage, and It cannot fail to prodooe beneficial results. I refer you to the report of the Secreta ry of the Interior, which is herewith laid before you for useful and varied Informa tion in relation to public lands, Indian gffitrs, patents, pensions and other mat ters whioh eoneern that part cf his do partment. The quantity of land disposed of daring the past and that quarter of the pesent fiscal year was three million eight hund red add forty-vne tljot.sani end tjre hund red and forty nine acres, of which 161,911 acres were sold for cash; 1,456,514 acres were taken up under the Homestead Law and ths residue disposed of under laws grantii,g lands t(,r military bounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also ap pears that the sale of the publio lands as is largely on the increase. It has long been a oherished opinion of some of our i?;;t statesmen that the peonle of the United states haa emgner end' nioe en during interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the publio (ecdi in the amount of direct revenue to be derived front the Sk! fcf them. Ttts opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the subjoot of our nat ional domain. I may cite, as evidence of this, ths libs ral measures adopted in reference to actual settlers The g-ant to the S lates of the overflowed lands maturing there largely In order to their being reclaimed, and render ed fit for cultivation ; the grant to railroad eompraies of alternate seasons or land upon ths contemplated lines of their road, hen completed, will too, largely, multiply the facilities for reaching our distant pos sessions. This policy has received it most signal and beoefioent illustration in the recent eoaotment granting homeeteads to actual settlers. Since the first day of Janu ary last the before-medtioned quantity of onemillion four hundred and fit ty-Bixthous-and five hundred and fourteen acre of land has been taken up under its provisions. This fact, and ths amount of rates, fur nish gratifying evidence of increasing set tlement upon the publio lands, notwith standing the great struggle in which the energy of the nation haa been engaged, and which has required so large a with drawal of our oitizens frjm their accus tomed pursuits. 1 cordially concur in the recommend! tion of the Secretary of the Interior sug gesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval eervice of the United States. I doubt not that Congress will cheerfally adopt snob measures as will, wi flout essentially changing the general features ef the sys tern, reserve, to ths greatest practical ex lent, Its benefits to those who have leit their home", in defence of the country, in this arduous onsis. I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary of War as to the proprie ty of raising by appropriation of Degro- lation, a revenue from the mineral lands of the United Slates. The measures provided at your last ses sion for the removal or certain Indi an tribes, have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the constitutional aotion of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguish ing the possessive rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of lands. It is probable that the effects of these treaties will result In the establishment or perman ent and friendly relations with such of those tribes as have been brought into fre uuent and bloody oollisions with our out tjiog settlements and emigrants ; sound policy JjdJ our imperative duty to these Wards of ths Government demand oar anxious and constant attention to thei material well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilization, and above all to their moral training, which under the blessings cf Divine Providence will con fer upon them the elevating and nenotify ing influences of the hopes and oonsola lions of the christian faith. I suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remedying our Indian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its neoessiiy. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary will evine the urgent need for immediate legislative aotion. I oommend the benevolent of the institutions established or patronized by the Government in this Department to to your generous and fostering care. The attention of Congress, daring the last sesfion, was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the Mississippi river and the north eastern Bsa board, whioh proposition however failed for the lime. Since then, npon a call of the great est respectability a convention has been called at Chicago upon the same BHhjsct, a summary of whose vies is before Congress in a memorial addressed to the presen CongresB and which I now have the honor to lay before yon. That the interest is one which ere long will force Its own way, I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now. Augmented Interest Is given to this euo- ject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacifio Railroad, under auspices so favorable to its rapid progress and com pletion. Enlarged navigation beoomes as palpable ned to the great road. I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the natl "m. Wnen Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many con hole on both land and sea, with varyin results. The rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limit;, yet the tone of publio feeling and opinion at home and abroad was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular eleotions then just past indicated uneasiness among ourselvee, while amid much that was oold and men aamg, the kindest words coming from Eu rope were ottered in accents of pity that we vrere too blind to surrender. Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and fur nished from foreign shores, and we were threatenetf with such additions from the same quarter as vould sseep our trade from the sea and raise our blookade. We had failed to elicit from European Govern menta anything hopeful upon this sutjeot. is a 

EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. The Emancipation Proclamation which was issued in September, was running its .Bsigael perip I to the beginning uf the New fear. A month later the nnal prnctama tion came, including the announoemen tost oolored men qf suitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of emancipation and of em ploying black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain oonnict According to our political system, as matter of civil administration, the General Government had no lawful power to e&ect emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion oould be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed possible that necessity for it might come and that if it should the crisis or the contest woud then be pseeeotea u cause, and as intended it was followed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having been passed, we arc permitted to take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still fur ther back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi river the country domioa (ed over by the rebellion is divided into distant parts, with io prtfcuoal comaump- tion between them, lennessee and Ar. kansas has been so substantially oleared of the Insurgents' control and influence in each, that owners (f e, laves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebel lion now deolare openly lor emancipation In their respective States. Of those States not included In ths emancipation procla mation Marvland and Missouri, neither J i-i-:v 1 . 1- . ,..11 , ' i ' . - VUlljlfta eiym wgu wuiiif lutein.. sy restrainiapon the extension of slavery into ths new Territories only dispute now as to the beat mode of removing it from within their own limits. 0' those who cer datif at tie beginning of he rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in" the United States ailitary ser viog,' aSont cue half qf Which number ao. tually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause and sup plying the places whioh otherwise must be filled with so many Lite ia. go far as tested, it is difficult to say that they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty has marked the measures qf eman cipation and arming the DiacKa. Il)ise measures hava been much discus sed in foreign countries, and oo temporary with such discussion tha tone of public sentiment there is much lmprovedj. At home the same measures have baen f'Uy dUousfced, Mpporteo, criticised and de nounced, and the annual eleotions follow ing are highly encouraging to those whose special duty it is to bear the oountry through this great trial. Thus ws have the reckoning that the crisis which threat ened to divide the friends of the Union i RECONSTRUCTION. Looking now to the present and future and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the States, Wherein that authority has been suspend- i. I have thcught fit to issue a proclama- lion, a copy of whioh is herewith trans mitted. On the examination of this proc lamation it will appear, as Is belived, amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given, but no man coerced to take it. A man is only promised a pardon, in case he voluntarily takes the oath, the Constitution author izes the Executive to grant on terms as it (ally established by judicial and other authorities. It is also proffered that of many of the States named real Government shall be in the mode prescribed, but if such Government shall he recognized and guaranteed Dy tne United States and that under it ths State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestio violence. X he constitutional obligation or the United S.ates to guarantee to every S-ate in the Union a republican form of government and to protect the State in the eases stated it is explicit and full. But why tender the benelts of this provision only to a State Government set up in this par ticular way? This seotion of the Uonstua. tion contemplates a case wherein the ele ment, whether a State, favorable to a republican government in the Union may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element, external to and even within the State, and suoa are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. An attempt to guarantee and protect a re- vised State government- conducted in whole or in preponderating part from ths very element against whose hostility ami violenoe it is to be protected, is simply ao surb. There must be a test by which to separate opposing elements so as to build only from the sand, and mat test is a sur- flciently liberal one, which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness. But if it be proper to require, as a test of admission to the political body, an oath of allegiance the Constitution of the United States and to the Union under it, why aleo to laws and proclamation in regard to slavery Toose laws and proclamations were en noted and put forth for the purpose of aid- lag ia the suppression of the rebellion. To give them thetr fullest effect, there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. Ia mv judgment they have aided and will furtner aid ths oause for whioh they were enlisted. To give up this principle would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and astounding breach of faith. I may add at this point, that while I remain in my present position, I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of tee proclamation, or by any act of Congress. For these and other reasons it is thought best that the support of these persons shall be inoluded in tne oath, and it is believed the .bxceuttve may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and ihe restoration of projected rights, which he has dear constitutional power to with- hold altogether or grant upon tha terms which he shall deem wisest for the puDin interest. It should be observed also that this part of the oath is subjeot to ths mod. ifyingaod abrogating power of legislation and supreme judiotal deoision. The proposed acquieeenoe of ths Nation al Executive in any honorable temporary arrangement for the freed people, is made with a view of possibly modifying the con fusion and destitution which must at best attend all olasses by a total revolution of labor throughout the whole of the States It is hoped that the already deeply fflict ed people in these States may be somewhat mire ready to give up the cause of their affliction and to this extent the vital mat ter left to themselves, while no power of the national Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by proposition. Tne sugges.ion In the proclamation as to main taintng the politioal framework of the States on what is oalled a reconstruction, is made ia the hope that it mav do good without the danger of harm. It will save labor and avoid great confusion. Bat why any proolamition now upon this subject? This question is beset with the conflioting views that the step might be delayed too long, or be taken too soon, in some elements tor resump- tion they seem ready for action, but remain inactive, apparently for want or a rally ing point a plan of aotion. ' Why shall I accept the plan of B rather than that of A, and if A and 1) should agree, now can they know that the General Government here will respect their plant m tn proclamation a plan is presented whioh may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in ad- vance will not be rejected here. This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The object to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consists in the danger of oomutitmentg la points which sould be more safely left to further devel opmenia. Care has been taken to so snap the documents as to avoid embarrassment from this source in saying that in oertain terms classes will he pardoned with their rights restored, it is not said that other olasses on other terms will never oe in cludsd in saying that a reconstruction will be accepted, If presented In a specified sir, It is not said that it will never be acJCDtedin any other way. The movements by State action for emancipation in several of the States not included in the emancipation proclama tion, are matters of profound gratulaiion, and while I do not repeat, in detail, what 1 have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings remain unohanged, and X trust that Con. gress will omit no fair opportunity of aid mg these important steps to the great eon summation. In the midst of other cares, however ica portant, ive must not tone sight of the faot that the. War Power is still our main re liance. To that power alone can we look yet for a time to give oonQence to the people In codes tod regions that the insur gent power will not again overrun them. Until that oonfideuce shall be established little can be done anywhere for what is called reconstruction, hencs our chief care must still be directed to our army and navy, whQ have ti,u,s f borne their harder parts so nobly and well and it may be esteemed fortunate that in giv ing the greatest effloienoy to their Indis pensable arms, ne do alio honorably n Courage gallant men, .from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom, more than to all others, the world must stand Indebted for the home of freedom, disenthraled, icgonexateoj, enlarge and the to f
