COLUMBIA. Thursday Morning. Dec. 14. 1885. Sign? of Reaction. Thc latest Northern papers we have re? ceived, (the 8th inst.,) bring tis some signs of a healthy reaction in Congress. On Wednesday, Oth, both Houses adjourned until Monday last, but on that day, as we leam from the Washington correspon? dents of the New York Herald and other papers, there were several indications that the manly, frank and able message of the President, had a wholesome influence on the movements of the radicals in both bodies of Congress. "For instance, on Wednesday, the message liavingbeen delivered thc day before, Mr. ?arusworth, of Illinois, a radical of tho North-western school, submitted to the House, a resolution declaring it as thc sense of that body, that good faith de? mands that all colored soldiers who have been in thc service of thc Union, shall enjoy aft thc rights of citizenship. Of course, " all the rights of citizenship" in? clude the right of suffrage. But it appears that the House, on the spur of tho oc? casion, was not prepared to a ipi this resolution, which, though limited to colored soldiers, involved a direct issue with President Johnson on the question whether this thing of the right of suffrage ls a matter which belongs to Congress or to tho several States. Upon this question, as thc Constitution and the usages of thc past and thc present time are all on tho side of the President, a break with him, it was evidently thought, was an affair en titled to a little 2ool consideration. And ?eo, a debato arising on the resolution, Mr. Farnsworth was judiciously persuaded to Jct it so over to some other day, without attempting a two-thirds test for the sus pensionof thc rules. It appears that even thc terrible Thaddeus Stevens himself had bocomc considerably softened since Mon * 

?JAJT, and was altogether in a more amia Tble frame of mind on Wednesday. In tho Renate, on the same day, we have another indication of a considerable modi? fication in tho temper of the radicals. On that day, Mr. Sumner, as tho Herald in? forms us,, introduced a resolution referring to the oath of loyalty required of one class .of men entering upon the duties of any pnblic office, and remarking, that "whereas it is reported that, notwithstanding the acts of Congress, certain persons have i>ecn allowed to enter upon the duties of office, (Treasury Department,) and to re ?eivo the salary and emoluments thereof, without taking the prescribed oath, and certain persons have been appointed to offices not authorized by any previously existing law, therefore, resolved, that the Secretary of the Treasury be requested, so lar a? thc records of his department allow," Ac., to furnish thc needful information on the subject. This resolution, over tho shoulders of thc Secretary of the Treasury, WAS evidently aimed at tho President, and at his proceedings in reference to certain provisional officials of his in the Southern States. Under the rule, it lies over a day, and, wben culled up again, we may, per? haps, have an interesting debate upon it. Bnt tbe little passage at arms which fol? lowed between Mr. Sumner and Mr. Doo? little touched the kernel of the main ques? tion. Mr. Doolittle moved to refer that portion of the message which treats of tho existing relations of thc late rebel States io the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Sumner remarked that there was now on the Sec? retary'? table a resolution (that of Mr. Stcvrnafrom the House) providing for the appointment of a joint committee, to whom this subject should be referred. It would be better, he thought, to await the passage of this resolution, and then let the sub? ject (President's message in relation to the South) go to that, special committee. Mr. Doolittk- thought that thc joint resolution itself ought to go to the Judiciary Com? mittee, and just here the House proposi? tion for an adjournment over to Monday caine in and cut off any further proceed? ings. Hero wc see against Sumner, a leading Republican Senator from thc West, boklly inking bis position 0:1 the side cf ?*. President. Tin; result will probably be mich a modification ol the Stevens resolution as to leave each house, as tho Constitution ordains, thc judge of thc qualifications of its members, instead of tying np and handing over both houses and tho President to the care of a joint <\>mmittoc. We lave reason to believe that these in? dications are corroborated by advices from Washington, and that as soon ;is the late seceding States have accepted the provi? sions und conditions embraced in the plan of the President for restoring them to their position in the Union, he will submit their rights to a restoration to Congress; if rejected, the 

?HSUO between him and the radical* will there be squarely made up and presented to tbo country, in tue elec? tions that may come on during the year. The President holds the impregnable ground, tiiat tho excluded .Southern States are not ont of the Union, and never have been; that they only need a rc-organiza tion under the Constitution and existing laws of the Union, to he entitled to all the rights in the General Government which belong to the other loyal States. He has only to adhere to this ground to secure the establishment of his policy in this Congress or the next. We believe with thc Herald, however, from the cooling down of the radicals on the day after the reception of the message, that a whole? some reaction has already commenced, which will make thc President's policy thc programme of tho present Congress. When such (dd radical campaigners as Thaddeus Stevens begin to tack ship, it is because they see breakers ahead. Gratifying Intelligence. Provisional Governor Terry lias furnished us with the following highly gratifying despatch, received yesterday from Presi? dent Johnson: 

WA.SHINC.TOX, December ll.-I thank you for your despatch. It is gratifying to know that the message was favorably received. In a few days, you will receivo full instruc? tions as to bei.'ig relieved as Provisional Governor, A hope that all will move off right, in a Tew dave, with Congress. ANDREW JOHNSON, President United States. Latries to ?>c Paid. Thc Milledgevflle (Ga.) Union states that it has good authority for saying that all men over the agc of sixty-five, who took no part in the war, and all widows, at the time General Sherman's army injured their property, will he reimbursed by tho United States Government for damages. Tue assessor is already at, work in tho County of Hancock, ascertaining damages so far as respects the two classes of our people above named. Should this policy of restitution be generally adopted, and the losses of non? combatants by the march of General Sherman's army made good, it will prove one of the most interesting items of intelligence we have received for ten months past. We trust that thc Go? vernment will extend this act of justice all over the territory, which has boen laid waste by its armies, and tims still closer bind the Southern people to its unqualified support.

Sumter and Kershaw Districts. In taking leave of political life, I trust it may not bo considered inappropriate for mo to address a few parting words to you, having for so many years associated with you in the intimato relation of representa? tive. In 18511 took an active part in op? position to secession. When I first took my soat in Washington, wc had a friend in the presidency, a majority in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate there were only four members of the freesoil party. The first great error we committed was in repealing tho Missouri compromise I shared in that error and may the more freoly refer to it. This unfortunate step opened anew the slavery agitation. I be? came satisfied before the Kansas contro? versy had conic to an end, that we of thc South had made a mistake in going into the struggle for Kansas. I saw that Kansas was obliged to bo a free State. When, therefore, Kansas applied, or appeared to apply, for admission under tho Lecompton Constitution, I sought an interview with Senator Hunter, of Virginia, for whose judgment I had the highest respect, and proposed to him, that we should reject Kan? sas, and thus take the wind out of thc sails of tho Republican party. I took ground against thc annexation of Cuba, mainly because I did not wish to add any more fuel to thc anti-slavery agitation. I agi? tated the subject of free trade, in order to organize parties upon a less dangerous isue than slavery, and to cement an alliance be? tween the South and great North-west. I took ground against the proposition to revive tho African slave trade, because I thought it impossible, inexpediunt and cal? culated only to act as a firebrand. In 1855, being deeply impressed with thc danger of thc Federal Government passing into the hands of the Republican party, and anxious to avert this calamity, I wrote a letter and publish? '! a speech delivered near Rock Hill, in York District, to a por? tion of my constituents. In those publica? tions I undertook to inaugurate a new lino of policy for our State. I said our great object then, was todo ever} thing possible to prevent the election of ? Republican President, that to accomplish th's, our policy was, "moderation, moderation, moderation." I said "our policy consists in the greatest possible degree of modera? tion in the political movements of tho South. I then advanced a doctrine on the subject of slavery in tho Territories, which no public man in this Stute had before ven? tured to put forth. On this point I said "As regards tho Territorial question, f think it nt this time a specnlafivi* quention, because the Territories of the United States open to settlement aro impossible to slavery." It is necessary for mo to say that I deeply deplore the disruption of tho Democratic party at Chorleston and Balti? more. I thought that tho South, in pushing the Territorial question as far as they did, in these conventions, committed the great? est possible blunder. If they succeeded on the Territorial question, thev gained no tuing, because there were no Territories Sossible to slavery. If they broke down tho democratic party, they ran the risk of a convulsion from which they might lose everything. In tho summer of I860, in re? ply to a call for my opinion, I advocated secession in case of Mr. Lincoln's election. Those who can refer to that letter will seo that I stated secession would lead to one of the threo results, a satisfactory adjust? ment, a peaceful separation, or war. I was perfectly certain it would lead to a satis? factory adjustment. I believe there was sufficient conservatism and prudence out? side of the State, both North and South, to settle tho question at issue. I was confi dent'that Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana would exhaust all efforts for a peaceful settlement, before breaking up thq Union. Some persons have asked me, why, oppos? ing secession so warmly in 1852. I yot favored it in IStiO. My answer is, that I thought tho time had come to get definite settlement of tho slavery question, and I thought such settlement certainly attain? able in 18?0. Besides, a public man is obliged, in order to preserve any influence, to consult the temper of tho people. It was impossible in ltstiO to oppose secession in this State and preserve any boldon pub? lic opinion. My purpose was to use seces? sion, like nullification had been used in 1832, to obtain a good settlement. In De? cember. I860, I went on to Washington. While- there 1 took every step I thought available for me, in my situation, to facili? tate a settlement, 1 communicated my ideas in this regard to such leading men there as were disposed to act on that line. Among others to President Johnson, then Senator from Tennessee. I had a confi? dential intercourse with Senator Douglas, to accomplish a settlement. He was san? guine of such a result if the South wore prudent, gave time and avoided war. The result ol my consultation with him was, that at bis instance I called on Senator Davis, of Mississippi, to invite him into a confidential conference with Senator Doug? las. Mr. Douglas said he was satisfied if Mr. Davis could agree upwn a programme of settlement, every thing could be har? moniously arranged. I wrote from Wash? ington to Mr. William S. Lyles, a member of our State Convention from Fairfield, urging upon him in tho strongest terms, the avoidance of every step tend-ug to a collision with the United States authorities. I wrote in the same strain to a high official in uur State, and to Mr. Keitt. When 'our comm well, Orr ami Ada: ton, I called upon ii lino of policy. I wrote -, Now York, Mr. Pell, at the same time, and stated my ideas of a compromiso. I pro Eoscd in this letter to Mr. Pell, an extract .om which was published at tho time, in tlie Now York Keening Post, that t he South should give up rda very in the Territories, and the North should, l.y an amendment to the Constitution, leave slavery in the States to the action of each State. In this letter I abo asked for the South :>? balance of power principle, to bc inserted in tlie Constitution to protect the Southern s.'ctiou. I would not, however, ha-e made this an ultimatum. It was with most profound sadness that I bearii of tho attack on Fort Sumter. I thought it wan a great mistake, and opened a future of indefinite horrors to my view. I did not think the authorities ?it Washington or Richmond either, had sufficiently exerted ! themselves to avoid a collision. Mr. I Seward was evidently impressed with the ' great policy of conciliation, which was obliged to be successful, hut he was over? borne by the pressure in his own party. ' After the first battle of Manassas, I threw j out the suggestion in secret session of I Congress, that wi- should send tin: prison- ? ers back. At the same time, I urged that 1 propositions for peace should be made, j After Gen. McClellan was driven from Rich- i mond, I wrote to Mr. benjamin, then ? Secretary of State, and urged upon : him the policy of opening negotiations ? when Congress assembled. 1 made this i policy the subject of a resolution and an j urgent address in secret session. As soon as I saw how earnest thc- Northern States ' were in prosecuting the war, I saw it was I impossible for the South even to have a I permanent peace, while the Mississippi ! flowed in its presetd channel. I was satis? fied the onlv satisfactory solution was ? peace through the agency of the conserva- i tive portion of the North in possession of ? thc Government. I moved a resolution en i the subject of peace again in secret session, ? in the winter of 1804. I need not refer to ! my 1: Uer in September, 1864, to President Davis, with which you are familiar, for it j created great opposition to me, an opposi? tion which does not die out even now. | When Mr. Blair came to Richmond on his ? peace embassy. I did everything I could to i make his etlorts successful. I should ! also add, that during the war 1 always ! urged the most humane treatment possi? ble to the prisoners, as tending to benefit the condition of our own soldiers in tho hands of the United States, and leaving the door to conciliation as open as possi? ble. A few words as to our present policy, and I will have finished. Your rehabilita? tion is objected toby a party at the North, on the ground that you are not loyal to the Union. To avoid the objection, you should do everything in your power to manifest the sincerity of your devotion to the Union. And this is not difficult in your position, for nothing else is possible but the Union. The only possible way to preserve free in? stitutions is by clinging to the Union. A wise people never seek the impossible, they make thc best they can out of the at? tainable. Another objection is, you will not do justice to the emancipated blacks. You must get over this obstacle as well as you can, by doing everything that is possible, .consistent with your own safety, to give them perfect equality and justice before the law. Upon this point I would say, you cannot do better than conform to the opinion of President Johnson; for it will be impossible for you to maintain any other line of policy in thia regard, than what may be laid down by tho President. While I think the experiment of free labor should bo fairly tried, and under every circum? stance of humanity and kindness on your part to tho blacks, yet I am not by "any means hopeful of th? result. I think the salvation of the South depends on the colonization of the blacks, and white im? migration. Looking to tho great future, I should say, the first thing for tho South is white immigration, the second thing is white immigration, the third thing is white immigration. You should do every? thing in your power to invite a white popu? lation, both hy your legislation, and favora? ble public sentiment. Receive immigrants from Europe and tho United States with open arms. The danger in the future is in a collision of races, your safety, is the closest sympathy with your own race in the United States. You need the friend? ship of the American people, take every step to obtain it. Another objection to reconstruction is that the national debt will be in danger of repudiation from your votes. This would bo a fatal policy on your part-sustain tho national debt as a fundamental article of your policy. And now, fellow-citizens, permit me to take a kind farewell of you, and to return you my sincere thanks for your generous support for so many years. Had the Stat? needed my services, I should have shared her fortunos to tho end. But I now fed at liberty to seek elsewhere to restore my fortune, shattered as it has been by the war. I shall remember nothing but your kindness, and will lose no opportunity that may be in my power, to advanco your in? terests. With great respect, icc,
