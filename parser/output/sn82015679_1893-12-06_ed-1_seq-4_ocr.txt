WASHINGTON, D. C.-Rigz Iloaso and Ebbitt The Brltl3h press is delighted with the president's message. That la because It is H Dritish message. The Chicago platform declares In favor tf a tariff for revenue only, but the Wilson bill Is a tariff for deficiency only. Mr. Cleveland spoke of the election of 1S32, but he has not yet heard of the most emphatic declarations of 1833. He will. There is this much to be said for Van Alen: The shafts of public criticism did af fect him while they failed to pierce the pachydermatous President. Van Alen stock has risen materially since lie pot his letters into print, but when he pave the public Mr. Cleveland's letters he dealt him a back-hander in the face. ."If Mr. Cleveland can lead his party In the line of his message," says a British paper, "the United States Is on the high read to free trade." Fortunately there is another party, a rapidly growing one, which the President cannot lead. Eut If the civil-service monopolists, poor Irlngs, are grieved at Mr. Cleveland's char acterization, the old line Bourbon, when he tomes to comprehend the force of the Pres ident's words, will reiterate faith in the Cleveland brand of Democracy. It Is now denied that the circular sent to the members of the. Maryland Legislature advocating a division of the school funds emanated from Cardinal Gibbons.' If this i3 the case, the name of the author should be given, as it Is a very important matter. The failure of the President to make any allusion whatever in his message to the proposed repeal of the 10 per cent, tax on fitate bank circulation is construed by both the supporters and the opponents of the measure as favoring their view. Some peo ple call this statesmanship. An Importer has been permitted to take elx or eight pages of the Forum to show that the present time, because there is general calamity already. Is the most fa vorable opportunity to change to a revenue basis. Unfortunately for the importer and the Forum, a majority of the American people object. It is simply childish to complain that Lon fion was reading ;the President's message before th& residents of any American city. iWhen the majority of a Congress and a President are devoting themselves to pro moting British Interests, the British are logically entitled to the first reading of that Ircsident's message. If Mr. Van Alen gave the Cleveland cor respondence to the press without his knowl edge and consent, he ha.3 yet something to lecrn concerning the unwritten law regard ing correspondence between men of honor. Nevertheless, If Mr. Van Alen had not given out the Cleveland letters the public would have missed a great deal of first rate fun. . The Council should steer clear of all propo sitions to tax on class of business men in the interest of another, or to tax any class out of business. Peddling groceries and fruits by wagon Is just as legitimate a busi ness as selling them from a permanent fctand. It is an accommodation to many families to have their supplies brought to the door, and if the peddlers keep prices clown the public does not suffer. Judging from the way the supply is regulated and prices controlled the commission men and grocers are quite able to take care of them selves without a discriminating tax against peddlers. Mystery still surrounds the administra tion's policy towards Hawaii. The dis patching of the United States revenue cut ter Thomas Corwln to Honolulu means something important, but just what time alone can determine. It shows conclusive ly, however, that things have not turned out as the administration expected them to, and that in order to conceal something or accomplish something to counteract for mer orders or issue new ones it has de cided to dispatch a government vessel to Honolulu rather than wait till the next reg ular steamer. This will be the second gov ernment vessel sent to Honolulu by this administration on a mysterious errand. The first bore Paramount Blount and his secret instruction?, while the mission or the Cor- win is still a mystery. These voyages cost money, but it must be remembered there la the restoration of a monarchy at stake. Councilman Merritt's ordinance, relative to the repairing of streets by companies or corporations which have torn them up for the purpose of making improvements, should receive careful consideration, and if it is found to provide an adequate remedy for the evil It aims to cure it should be passed. I'or many years past our streets have suf fered at the hands of various corporations which are allowed to use them. The streets pre torn up at the pleasure of the corpora tions to lay pipes or make connections or repairs, and then are left weeks or months without being restored. Often they are never restored. It would be Impossible to estimate the amount of damage which, first and last, has been done to the streets in this way. The Merritt ordinance aims at binding the corporation by an express con tract to place the street in good repair, com pliance with the contract to be guaranteed by the previous deposit of a certain sum of money, which shall only be returned when the work of repair la fully completed. The principle is correct, and it ought to be sus ceptible of an application that will compel corporations to do their duty In this behalf. 

KIGLUES .MADE TO DCCHIVH. The figures of Secretary Carlisle fail to show where the much -proclaimed retrench ment of the Cleveland administration comes in. He wants $411,873,041 to run the gov ernment during th? next fiscal year, against $121,612,213 appropriated for the present year. If he had added the $11,000,000 required by the provisions of the law relative to the sugar bounty, the amount which he would call upon Congress to furnish would be S122,S7?,0I1, or a larger sum than last year. In his estimates, moreover, Secretary Car lisle only inserts the amount of money for the postal service which will be the ex cess of the expenditures of the department over its receipts. During recent years the aggregate expenditures of the Postal De partment were included In the estimates. By including the receipts of the department during the Fifty-first Congress the Demo crats were able to raise the cry of a "billion-dollar Congress." If the earnings of the Postofiice Department are the same as last year, namely, $75,800,000, in round num bers, and the deficit shall be $S,000,000, as Secretary Carlisle estimates, the total ap propriation for the postal service must be over $$J0,OjO. If $73,800,000 is added to the total estimates of Mr. Carlisle the real ap piopriations for which he calls aggregate $1S7,679,000 for one year and for two years $373,353,000, which is perilously near a billion-dollar Congress more than a dozen millions nearer it than was the aggregate of the Fifty-first Congress. It should bo added that Secretary Carlisle makes no es timate for a river and harbor appropria tion bill, which, for the carrying forward of improvements of national "importance, rather than clearing out interior streams, is a very important matter and one which no Congress has for many years passed over during a first session. A river and harbor appropriation of J20.000.000, with the sugar bounty, would send the Carlisle esti mates beyond, the half-billion line more than a dozen millions. The Journal does not accuse Mr. Cleve land's Secretary of extravagance, but to make good the claims of the Infallible One for practical economy it can do no less than show that he has cunningly withheld estimates of expenditures which Congress will probably make. The Republic is a big affair and requires a large sum of money to maintain it. A patriotic people will approve any expenditure necessary to make their government what it should be, but large expenditures should be made with the wisdom of broad statesmanship a quality not found in a President who di lates in his message upon the extravagance of purchasing a few more bushels of seed beans than appear to be necessary.

AVILSOX'S KILL UK DEFEATED f Backed by the PresiJent, it is altogether probable that the Wilson bill, with little modification, will be passed by the Iiou:rc. The Democratic majority Is about ninety a number too large to be turned against a party bill, as was the case when, under the lead of Samuel J. Randall, two Democratic houses sustained a motion to strike out the enacting clause of the Wood and Morrison tariff bills. Added to the Republicans, Mr. Randall led enough Democrats to kill the bills. But there is no Randall among the Democrats of the present House, and the Democratic majority is larger than on the occasions referred to. Besides, there is a President, the Wilson bill is the Cleveland bill, and his heavy hand will be felt by weak Democrats who would now atone for their disobedience in voting against the bill re pealing the silver purchase act by sustain ing the Wilson or Cleveland tariff bill. These Democrats are anxious to open a new account in pcstofiice3 with the President. Consequently, none need be surprised to see the Wilson bill made a caucus measure and carried through the House. In the Senate it is different. Making allow ance for the three, vacancies which, by the action of the Senate, cannot be tilled until the Legislatures of th-? Srates where they exl.t shall meet, there are eighty-five Sena tors, of whom forty-four are Democrats, thirty-nine are Republicans and three are Populists. It will take forty-three votes, or an equivalent of that number in votes and pairs to pas3 the administration tariff bill. Peffer, of the Populists, has been -a life long protectionist, and the probability is that he would not vote for the anti-protec- llon bill of Mr. Cleveland, who has ignored the Populists in the dispensing of ofllces. Kyle, of South Dakota, and Allen, of Ne braska, cannot be counted on, but there is no reason why they should vote for the Cleveland bill unless the President wins Ihem by the seductive influences of ra ti onage. Can any Democrat be counted on to oppose the President's tarhT bill? Sena tor Gorman Is not now in love with the President, and is less infatuated with Secre tary Carlisle. Maryland is a coal State, and its people are interested in the iron in dustries. It seems probable that Mr. Gor man and his colleague may oppose the Wil son bill. The term of Senator Camden, of West Virginia, expires in a year, and the Legislature which will hold his fate in Its hands will be elected next November. . To vote for free coal and free ores would be to sign his own political death warrant. Then, there are Senators Hill and Murphy, of New York. Between thorn and the Prerldent war has not only been declared, but hostili ties have reached the tomahawk stage, the President taking the? aggressive. Hill is a protectionist, and it may be assumed that Murphy is In sympathy with him. At any rate, th President and his friends in Xew York arc organizing to destroy them. As a whole no State in the Union would suffer more by the President's tariff bill, if enacted, than New York. Senators Hill and Murphy understand this, and, under standing it, what would be more natural than to Interpose to defeat the administra tion? Thus it seems that there is a good fighting chance to defeat or greatly modify the administration tariff bill in the Senate. Mil. 

WILSOVS COXTIt ADICTOItY STATEMKMS. In his statement explaining and defend ing the new tariff bill Chairman Wilson said: "The workingman can see whether his Interest Is with a system that represses production and rob3 him of employment, or with a system that gives natural and healthy play to production and emancipates him from trusts and like combinations of capital." In a more recent statement he repeats and amplifies this idea as follows: There is scarcely one of our great in dustries in which our present capacity to produce has not far outstripped the de mand, and remunerative consumption of the home market. By the labors and activ ity of six months they are generally able to produce one entire year's consumption. It is equally true that nearly every one of these industries is beginning, in a. more or less vigorous way, to enter the outside markets, and that the chief barrier in their way is the burden of taxes which the gov ernment puts upon the materials they use. We call attention to the Inconsistency of these two statements. In the first Mr. Wilson saj's that protection "represses pro duction," while In the other" he declares that It has so stimulated production that our capacity to produce has "far out stripped the demand," and that our manu factories are generally able to produce In six months one year's entire consumption. In each case the alleged condition, re pression of production in one case and overproduction in the other, Is declared to be a prime reason why workingmen have not steady employment. The inconsistent statements are irreconcilable. One or the other must be false. Protection cannot at once repress production to the extent of robbing workingmen of employment and stimulate production to the extent of caus ing factories to close half the year. We believe every honest, reasonable man who has not gone wild in support of a theory will say that neither statement is true. It is true that at present the manu facturing Industries of the country are greatly depressed and an unprecedentedly large number of persons are out of em ployment, bat this condition is entirely ex ceptional. Nothing of the kind has hap pened before during thirty years of pro tection, and no reasonable man can be- lieve for a moment that the present con dition is due to that cause. On the con trary. It is within the knowledge of every person old enough to be cognizant of the facts that the last thirty years have been the most prosperous in the history of the country. In no like period have working men had In the main as steady employ ment or as 'good wages. There have been ups and downs in business, some labor troubles and occasional strikes, -with now and then a temporary reduction of wages; but on the whole the condition of working men was never as good In any similar period In the history of the country as it has been during the last thirty years. Mr. Wilson's contradictory assertions that pro tection has repressed production, and that it has unduly stimulated production can safely be left to the intelligent Judgment of the American people. Admitting either or both of his state ments to be true, and that protection has been an injury to workingmen, how are they going to be benefited by free trade or any approach thereto? Mr. Wilson says it will open to us the markets of the world. If American manufacturers are suf fering for foreign markets the demand for the opening of such markets ought to come from them, but It does not. It comes only from free-trade doctrinaires like Mr. Wilson. The only plea American manu facturers make is to be allowed undis puted possession of the home market. They know what it is to be ruined by protec tion, and they rather enjoy it. li:wi:lli; ox vagiiaxcv. Governor Lewelling's circular to police commissioners throughout the State of Kansas is indicative of the trend of opin ion among a certain class of semi-cranks of whom he is one. We infer that under the Metropolitan police law of Kansas the police commissioners are subject to the control of the Governor, so that his circu lar has the force of an official instruction. In effect it urges the practical abolition or nullification of the vagrancy law of the State. Nearly every State has such a law. That of Indiana Is as follows: Any perron, inal'i or female, over thnge of fourteen years, and physically able to perforin manual labor, win has not male reasonable effort to procure employment, or who has refused to labor for compensa tion when labor is offered, who is found in a state of vagrancy or practicing common begging, shall be lined not more than fifty dollars nor less than five dollars. We do not know exactly what the va grancy law of Kansas is, but it is probably very much like the foregoing. It is a wholesome law. and its phraseology is well guarded against abuse. No State can af ford to encourage or permit willful and persistent vagrancy. To do so wculd be offering a premium on Idleness and beg gary. That would be an outrage on indus try. At the same time no community can afford to persecute honest poverty. That would be an outrage against humanity. But with a well guarded law and sensible of ficials there Is little danger of confounding a willful or professional vagrant with an honest poor man who Is temporarily in hard lines. As v. ill be observed by the section quoted, to constitute vagrancy in this State it must appear that the person has not made reasonable effort to procure employment or has refused to labor for compensation when labor was offered, and has been found in a state of vagrancy or begging. Under these conditions there is very little danger of an honest poor man being mistaken for a, vagrant. The truth is the vagrant laws in this country gener ally are not as vigorously enforced as they ought to be. There are too many profes sional tramps too many wandering va grants who would rather beg or steal than work. For the honest ioor man. for the willing lalorer who cannot get employment there is room for deepest sympathy, and every heart and hand should Ik? open to help him. For the professional vagrant, the confirmed tramp, the habitual lcggar. there should be nothing but the workhouse or the stone pile. Governor Lewelllng makes no discrimina tion between these classes. From his point of view the professional tramp U entitled to as much sympathy and consideration as the honest lalorcr who cannot find employ ment. He makes an indiscriminate attack on the vagrant law, condemns the prac tice of arresting tramps, and advises doing away with all penalties for vagrancy. If he had reminded officers of the law that in these hrd times they should be careful not to class honest unemployed laborers with professional vagrants, his action would have been commendable, but when he urges the Ignoring of all laws against va grancy he arrays himself with the ene mies of society. Kansas used to be known as the home of Industry and thrift; Gov. Lewelling would make it the home of tramps and beggars. Several Indiana Democratic Congressmen are exercised over a report, which they firmly believe, that elements in the national Democratic committee are at work to d? leat the renomlnation of all so-called anti ndministration Democratic Congressmen. In Indiana the list is clearly defined, ac cording to one of the members of the dele gation. All Democratic Representatives fiom Indiana, except Messrs. Cooper, liy num and Brookshire, are said to be eligi ble to a place on Mr. Cleveland's "retired" list. Let not the Indiana Democratic Repre sentatives agitate their Intellects over such rumors as the above. It will be a matter of no consequence whether they are candi dates or not after they vote for the Wilson bill. In fact, it would be money in their pockets, or, at least, time at their disposal, if time has any value to them, if they are deprived of nominations by the agents of the Anointed One. As citizens, it will be greatly to their credit to be on the "retired list" of a President who makes subserv iency to his vicious pension system a test of loyalty. But when before did a Presi dent ever have a committee to make lists of men to be nominated and to be retired? "The world knows nothing of its greatest men," says one of England's poets. Anoth er has told us that "full many a flower Is born to blush unseen and waste Its sweet ness on the desert air." Van Alen is a case in point. His letter declining the Italian mission has suddenly made a great man of him in Democratic estimation. He is a newly discovered patriot and statesman. What have the American people been about all these years that they have let this modest flower go on blushing unseen? How has the country ever got along with out being represented abroad by Van Alen? As he has suddenly become such a blooming patriot and great man, why not make him the Democratic candidate for President in 18? No doubt Mr. Cleveland and Secretary Gresham would give him their cordial support in order to "right a great wrong," as they say in Hawaii. Just as soon as he got back to Indiana and looked over the ground. Senator Voor hecs became a free coinage man. He seems to us to be a. genuine North American bl mttallist a free coinage man at home and a gold bug in Washington. Atlanta Consti tution (Dem.)

And yet our senior Senator really has mere friends In Indiana than any other Democrat in public life hailing from the State. But with ail his irresponsibility, which cannot be magnified, he has worked more patronage out of Mr. Cleveland for more or less shady persons than all the rest of the Democratic Senators have been able to do. To the Editor of the Indianapolis Journal: Was the phrase "He descended Into hell" used in the apostles' creed by the Protest ants, and when was it dropped, and for what reason? 1,. C. G. The clause referred to Is not found in the "Niccano-Constantlnopolitan" creed (A. D., 3Sl), nor In any creed before that 5ate. It Is found in the Athanasian creed, fifth century, and was universally used after the eighth century. It remains in the apostles creed as used by the 'Roman and Greek churches, as also in the form used by the Lutheran church and the Church of Fngland. It Is also retained: In the form used by the Protestant Episcopal Church, with the option of using the words "He went into the place of departed spirits." The clause in question is omitted alto gether by the M. E. Church, and also by most Protestant churches of the United States of America. The Westminster cate chism states: "Christ's humiliation after death consisted in Hl3 being buried and continuing in the state of the dead, and under the power of death until the third day, which has been otherwise expressed in the words, 'He descended into hell.' " Evidently, then, the reason that the words In question were dropped is thl3; that they were not intended to convey any other meaning than that Christ was really dead and buried. This idea it seems better to express in simple words, rather than by a phrase which, to the modern mind, might bear a doubtful meaning.

New York Times (Dem.)

His sensitive nerves seem unstrung at the thought that there are those in this country, "Native to the manner born." who so appreciate the importance and advan tages of religious liberty as to combine for its preservation, because they consider it an essential part of the foundation upon which our civil institutions are resting, and must continue to rest, if they exist at all; and in order to give the force of authoritative teaching to his utterances he has availed himself of his right to enter the pulpit of his church and proclaim his opinions in a carefully-prepared and elaborate sermon, which he evidently regards as so filled with wisdom that it would be an offense against the public to withhold it from the newspa pers. This is "so excellent a touch of modesty" that too much praise cannot be bestowed upon it. He is surprised at the Ignorance of the multitude of Protestants, who have "neither the time nor the training for weighing facts and sifting evidence," because, being so conspicuously qualified for these things himself, it is an insoluble marvel to him that everybody else is not equally so. To satisfy other minds as fully as his own he points out, with great particularity, the similarities and adversities between Pro testants and Romanists in their respective methods of erecting churches, locating al tars and pulpits, wearing clerical vestments, etc., all of which have about as much to do with the fundamental differences be tween the two religions as the signet ring worn upon the priest's finger has with the secret impulses of his heart and mind. Still, he 13 commendable in the highest degree, in asmuch as he suggests to offending and ob durate Protestants that the best method of becoming truly enlightened is by "weigh ing facts and sifting evidence." When he reaches the point of divergence, he Insists that "a thing is not necessarily bad because Rome teacnes or practices it." a hypothesis which displays that marvel ous erudition required to construct a "man of straw." so that the achievement of striking it down may amaze all gaping spectators. The reason that he assigns for this is. that if it were so, we should have to "forswear the sacraments and the New Testament." etc., with a lengthy enume ration of d?talls. By this he makes no dis tinction between the Romish New Testa ment and that accepted as such by all Protestants, and places them side by side on the score of authority. Of course, he knew for one so capable of "weighing facts and sifting evidence" could not fall to know that the former teaches that "Ja cob worshiped the top of his rod," where by the faithful learn 1 that Inanimate ob jects, such as graven images, picture paint ings, fragments of the cross, et omne genus, may be rightfully worshipped; and he must also have known, that for this and other kindred reasons, the church whose ministerial gown he i3 permitted to wear has. for a multitude of years, and with absolute unanimity among its memlers, repudiated this Romish version, because it not only sanctions, but invites idolatry. Notwithstanding this, his culminating point is a tierce attack upon the editor, who has published in his paper ths picture of a nun kneeling before a crucifix, wh cli inanimate object he supposed her to be worshiping. Just as Jacob worshiped the top of his rod. and with her mind enthusea with the contemplation of the material ob ject before her, independently of the birth, life, teachings and divinity of Christ. It is supposed without knowing what the fact Is that the editor called this Idolatry. Whether he did or not is not material, in view of the fact his reverend castigator characterizes what he did as the outgrowth of "a brutal instinct" These are mild and gentle words, obviously not sioken from impulse, but sedulously deliberated ujK)n. They suggest the inquiry: Why were they employed? A moment's reflection furnishes the answer, which 13 this that the nun was worshiping after the teachings of ner church, the Romish, which had furnished her with a New Testament authorizing idol atry, and, therefore, she was rightfully wor shiping God, while tbJs "brutal" editor Was trying Vto wield the boomerang." the meaning of which latter word I do not exactly understand in this connection, un less it be that if the editor's weapons did not return of themselves to strike him, he would himself gather them up and fling them back at him from the sacred desk. BUILDING UPON ASSUMPTIONS. This same editor published, some time airo, what his volunteer assailant calls a false encyclical letter of the Pope, which, to him. is such an offense against morality as so astounds him that he calls upon all who wear ministerial robes to take up the cud gel for the slandered Pope and visit their fiercest wrath upon a prostituted press. Wherein the editor's publication was false he does not tell evidently deeming his own representation upon that subject quite suffi cient. It may or may not have been no matter since the assumption that it was is deemed sufficient by him to suggest this inquiry: "Is it possible that in the eyes of the Protestant ministry the end justifies the means?" Certainly, the Protestant ministry will feel flattered by this soft impeachment inasmuch as it involves the covert insinua tion that they have turned Jesuits. With these promises -to build upon obvi ously enthused by the beauty of the struc ture he has reared he. making no excep tions whatever, asserts as a fact that "there are Protestants who would rather see the city flooded with reeking dens of vilest iniquity than witness the work done by the I-lttle Sisters of the INor:" who "would rather see the rankest corruption" than their deeds of charity and love. This is somewhat ad eaptandum valgus, but pass ing by that, it is calculated to wring a pang of grief oven from a stoic's hetrt to be informed, upon such authority, what an unchristian and uncharitable part of the population the Protestants of Indian apolis are, but he undoubtedly thinks that this is not surprising in the least, inasmuch as it is owing to their Protestantism, which does not refrain them from vice as Roman ism does those who profess it; and for fear that this may be doubted by some, he veri ties his opinion by stating that there are 2i)0 ner cent, more of illegitimate births In "Protestant England" and "Protestant Scotland" than in "Roman Catholic Ire land." Having, doubtless, satisfied himself bv this statement, and hoping it would con vince others, that the moral influence of Romanism is better and more refining than that tf Irotestanticm. his oratory rises to its loftiest height. In pronouncing an Impas sioned eulogium upon the Roman Cttholie Church, which "exultant, exalted and tri uinnhant will live and prosper in soite of these cowardly enemies and assassins, on and ever on disseminating the gospel of Jesus Christ" especially that part of the New Testament which teaches idolatry by the example of Jacob's worshiping "the top of his rd." The pathos of this is ad mirable, but it suggests the supposition that ho believes himself potent enough to batter down the walls of partition which the work of more than three centuries has built up between Ilomarlsm and Protestantism. If he imagine:; that what he has st ited re garding h!s own and the Romish Church tint It Is "seiwratel from Rome by noth- irjtr thicker than a. paper wall" he t mis taken. And if he reinforces the opinions expressed in this sermon, the rupicion lie expresses that he may "be suspected of 1 Ing a Jesuit in disguise" may possibly lind some substantial basis. Rut the reverend assailant of Protestant ism and volunteer defender of Humanism and all the extremes of the papal system. j has strangely omitted to touch upon, or re fer to. Iho main nolnts at lru- letven that system and th American Protective Assoc lation-the members of which organi- 7atioti h" characterizes as "cowardly" anil I "ussassins." He lias something to sy J about the Pope's nsTted J Uprernace t . k -; ing care, however, to make it apply oniy I to matters of religious bM-f. and falling to i show (what he must have known) that r ' liTious belief, in the Romish and papal sene. includes the union of church and I st.it: the Mjbordlnn tion of the state to the church; the absolute? nullity of every con stitution avl law contravening the rights pml interests of th church they siall be defined by the Pope; and, ' J sides oher things, the absolute obligation to treat nil other forms of relitr'oe belief as heresy. ' so odious in the sigi(Jlf heaven as both to command and justify their extirpation, cut ting theni up by the pts. THIN G s" NOT TOLD. He concede- that the Roman Catholic Church Imperiously tcic.Vs that th e cathedra decisions of t!j Pope, touching all these and other mnttTs of relUi-'U faith 1k.Ui what is to lx- bcl! ved and done are equivalent to the d.xrces of God, and are to bo accepted as Mich. i;ut be f ailed to tell what he ought to have known before venturing to enter such a fl'dd-that many Popes have decreed, ex cat hi-Ira. all the foregoing articles of rellgl.iuj faith; that the present Pope has affirmed th. ra, and has, besidfs. dec reel that the only true form of religion In the world requires that his temporal crown shall Ik- t.-stort-i. even at the expense of overthrowing tl: present government of Italy; and that all religions, including the Protestant, which do not command this, are false and her eticalconferring no rights whatevi. be cause the curse of God reds m-on them. x-t run1meiUal principles of w hat I-o N I II considers the only religion which has the divine sanction have txvn profi-ssi-d and defended by him all his life. They were Impressed upon his mind by Jesuit training and influences in early life, and now that he wears the papal crown he teaches them hs absolutely necessary to salvation to all the faithful in this countrv as elsewhere: and he does this by the Vxercls? of im perial authority which he claims to be divinely conferred notwithstanding our civil institutions are founded ujon the id. m that every man i free to accept or reject any religious ldler he chcses. and teach that neither rvlision, nor patriotism, nor true social development, nor the interest or happiness of mankind require either force or compulsion in matters of conscience. And this same lmirial Pope, in the Im agined plenitude of his ijwer. requite. all his followers, everywhere, to labor in every possible way for the resorntion ot his temporal crown, so that be may be come. like his predecessors, an absolute monarch with full authority to extend his spiritual jurisdiction over the world and dictate to every conscience what it shall accept and what it shall relect, even if, in accomplishing this, his followers shall incite the governments under which they live to make war ujon the present govern ment of Italy, which he commands them to carry on. in some form or other, until the crown of royalty shall be restored to his own head or to that of some succes sor. What Is herein stated Is absolutely and incontestably true in every essential par ticular. Who. then, can rightfully say as this reverend gentleman has vcntur.nl to declare from his pulpit that any por tion of the native-lorn people of the United States shall bv? ranked with "assassins" merely teeause they unite themselves to gether to maintain inviolate the civil and religious liberty which is guaranteed bv their Institutions? The Roman Catholic part of our population are as safely pn tected by these guarantees as the native born. Thousands of them, understanding this, refuse to be dragoned lnb the recog nition of the politico-religion of Rome. But apart from these, the archbishops, and bishops and priests, with the deputy-Pope. JSatolli, at their head, constitute the most compact and secret association the world ever knew, unless it le their auxiliaries the Jesuits bound together by oaths pre scribed by the Pope from his palace in Rome, and striving day and nU,ht. with untiring Industry, to unite church and state so that the latter shall obey the former, to put an end to libert' of con science by establishing the Roman Catholic religion by law, to the exclusion of wery form of Christian and religious faith which dissents from it. and to make the Pope a crowned monarch t?o that he may become the irnierator and arbiter of our national destiny. To secure success In these and other schemes of like antagonism to our institutions, this formidable alliance has denounced our common schools as "God less" becam-e they do not teach the Roman Catholic religion, and as made heretical by the fact that they teach, instead, the liberty of conscience and the fret-dom of religious belief. They organize their fol lowers into other secret associations, equal ly compact with their own, and not only require that they shall be given the pref erence over Protestants in all kinds of public and private employment, but vote at elections for those who recognize this selfish and unchristian demand, and against those who are American and indeiKTulent enough to deny it. With such things as thee in oen and full view, and no attempt made to conceal them, the American Protective Association, or any other of whatsoever name, are in the simple performance of a. iriotic duty when they resovle, either in public? or in private, that they will oppose and resist all efforts, from Rome or elsewhere, to subvert any of the fundamental principles of our institutions by the Importation of others in conflict with them. And the who shall plant themselves in the way ot this vast multitude of American freemen, whether they be cleric or lay. native or foreign born, will find themselves as un able to arrest its course as tney are to drive back the tides of the ocem or to pluck a single ray of light from the sun.
