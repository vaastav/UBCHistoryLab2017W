•'SPOILS" VICTORY. Th.> -spoils" system dies hard. While the President has been engaged in extending the Civil Service laws to the fourth class postmas tersbips the House of Representatives has been busy keeping the Census Bureau open to po litica] appointees. The Crumpacker bill, which passed the House on December 9, provides that the additional clerical force which will be needed to t.«rke the census of 1910 shall be ap pointed on non-competitive examinations, which President Roosevelt in his special message to Congress at die last session called a "cloak to hide the nakedness of the spoils system." The additional employes in the last two censuses have iieen appointed after non-competitive ex animations, and the results abundantly justify the President's vigorous characterization. They were just as much political appointees as If there had been no examinations. The candidate who cot 7.". on his examination and had s Con gressman behind him was appointed over the m;m who pot 1<»0 but was without a "pull." The most that can be said for the non-competitive examination hi thot it weeded out the grossly incompetent from among the spoils candidates. The places remain the spoils of politics as fully as ever, and the appointees secured are not effi cient. Mr. Carroll D. Wright, when Census Di rector, estimated that the lack of Civil Service rul<\= added $2,000,000 to the cost of the last census. Mr. Boberl P. Porter, -who directed the Eleventh Onsus. writes to the National Civil Service Reform League: In my judgment the efficiency of th« decen nial census would be greatly improved and It? cost aleriaUy lessened if it were provided that the err.ployfs should be selected in accordance with the terms or the Civil Service law. Tbi= would relieve the Director of the Census of the burden of giving a very large share of his time tn tters of "patronage"" and allow him much more time- for attention to the iunctions l=sriti mair-ly pertaining' to this office. The census will cost more and will be of in ferior accuracy with the kind of employes ob tained through non-competitive examinations than would be the case with employes taken from the classified lists. The Orumpacker bill sacrifices the good of the census for the sake of a little patronage for the Congressmen. It should be amended in the Senate. TTS OyE 

GREAT SUCCESS. The report of Senator Bmoot to the National Conservation .Commission tbe other day called, attention to the fact that of the wooded areas publicly owned forestry was practised in 70 per cent, while of those privately owued it was prac tised In only 1 per cent. A contrast in favor >)f public ownership rather than private ownership is so rare as almost to make one blink, yet bere it is so plain ar,d undeniable that it cannot be explained away. And the advantage, too. is in respect to waste, just where public ownership has always been deemed weakest. When the public ownership of service corporations Is examined into it is al most invariably found to be more wasteful tban private ownership. But in regard to the forests the situation is shifted and the accusation at waste lies so heavily against private ownership that the press of the country cries out nnd th*> Governors of states meet in national convention and discuss it. The waste, however. i< of two different kinds ese two different examples of public and private ownership. The waste In the case of the i is what Is called "the waste of our na tional resources." It is waste in its largesr. hearings as it affects society in gen«r:il and the future of the country. And such waste public ownership is able to perceive, with It* wider outlook, much more clearly than private ownership, which looks selfishly only at the immediate present. Urn tbe waste that is found on the balance sheens of publicly owned service ations is waste from inefficient business management, «ud their private ownership, witb its view concentrated on immediate advantage, appears more effective. It Is not Impossible therefore, thai when private owners of forests ■re able to see the identity of their interest and the public interest in preserving them forestry will be more economically and efficiently con ducted under private tban under public owner ship. Meanwhile, public ownership in the case of the forests deserves credit for looking fur ther ahead than private ownership and regard ing waste from the social point of view when private ownership Is blind to it. TRADE WITH RUSSIA AXD SIBERIA. For the purpose of promoting tbe exportation of American products, the bureau of manufact ,ures iDepartment of Commerce and Labor) is in tije habit <'f publishing selected reports made by i nited States consuls, ii also employs ex perts of i's own selection to investigate par ticular possibilities of foreign trad". A col- tion of official papen relative to Russia (Con sular Keports, Annual Series, No. 20i. wblcb Ims just beea Issued, deals witb tbe chances of marketing a variety of macbinery In that country. The Information there supplied is sup plemented in tbe "Daily Consular Keports" of December 10 and 14. which are devoted exclu sively to Special Agent Dennis's study of the opportunity of selling American agricultural implements In European Russia. Siberia and M:i!i. iiuriit. Mr. Dennis's close association for a lifetime with the business of selling reapers and mowers abroad well qualifies him for the task committed to him by Major Carson, <iii.-f of tbe bureau of manufactures, and these docu ments deserve careful examination by the man ufacturers whom they nre intended to serve.

The retirement of Admiral Cervera from actiye service in the Spanish navy doses th" professional career of an officer whose actual achievements In war were by no means coin mensurate' with his personal deserts. It was a bitter irony th:it so gallant and chivalrous a sea fighter should become best known to thp world through his own irretrievable disaster. Be fore 1898 lie had served his country well for many years and in many ways, and was hou ored there, but his name was little known to th* world at large Rut since he was vanquished on that "loud Sabbath" »it Santiago his fame bat been world-wide, and it is by that defeat mat he will most generally be known in history. But such a fate is not quite so deplorable aa it might seem. Those who look beneath tin surface, into the heart of things, will readilj perceive that it wa< not Cervera who wai beaten at Santiago. Ii was the unreadiness ami Inefficiency of Spain and her incompetence t< guard her own possessions. He was the com mander not of a forlorn horn*, but of a hope which was doomed in advance. In desperate circumstances be acted like a hero. Had tbe Spanish naval equipment been commensurate with his spirit we should not so ea-ily have woi that ficht. Tn ouc famous battle tiie vanquisher cried to the victors, ••Change leaders with u< nnd we'll f.ght you .lirain and beat you:"' A' Santiago there was no room for such a plea It was not in the genius of leadership th.-: Spain was Ia « -k i niz. lr must be cause for gratification to Admiral Cervera, as it Is cause for gratitude in Amer ica, that in the very time of his defeat and liN captivity he contributed so much, by the fine ^c;o of bis demeanor, toward the restoration of friendly feelings between the two nations. Americans could not fall to respect a nation capable of producing such a man n< he, Jiu'l we are sure that the impressions which he re ceived of this country, not only from the muz zles of guns at Santiago but also from the bands and lips and hearts of the many whom he met In peaceful relations, and which he i turn convoyed to tils countrymen, went far to incline the Spanish people to a kindlier attitude mwnrd those -whom Iliey temporarily regarded as their foes. Tn that noble achievement h<» may well have found consolation for his defeat In war. Certainly on that account, as well as on many others, the American people ns sir terely as those of Spain will wish for the brave old admiral many years of health and happ - ness in his well earned retirement. THE \EW JERSEY LIQUOR TRADE. The report of the New Jersey Excise Commis sion to the Governor is less sensational than was the daily news of its investigations last summer. Indeed, the most sensational parts uf it are its recapitulations of the results of those investigations, from which, of course, the keen edge of novelty is now worn off. Still, tbe shov ing is sufficiently shocking to give the Legislat ure food for thought nnd ground for action. It is revealed that there has been elaborately or ganized violation of iLe law, and not only at those features of the law which many rea SO i fihle men consider too severe and which might perhaps well be repealed or modified, but also and equally of those provisions which every right-minded man knows and declares to be es sentinl to tbe public good. The sale of the vilest adulterated liquor was found to be widely prac tised, and there were alliances and collusion witb gamblers and crooks, nnd grand juries were manipulated for the protection of lav breakers. The stories wore shocking when they were published In the press. They arc ic-^s novel now in this report, but they have the weight >f official authority nud they should enlist the care ful attention of every legislator who has T te welfare and good repute of Ihe state at heart. The recommendations of tbe ■ommission tor tbe correction of those evils arc moderate and proceed from expert knowledge. Perhaps I" % mportani of them is that for the election of local excise boards of three members each, to have the power to grant or refuse licenses and generally to regulate tJie liquor trade n c hiding, we suppose, tbe ri.xing of license fees and of hours of sale. Such a system would be neither locrtl option nor home rule |n name, bur it would establish sonic of the best features of both. It would give to the voters of each city, town or village full power to eontn liquor trade as they pleased, subject only to :i few general state laws which arc Indispensable for all places alike It would make the pr n ciple of io.-al self-government effective, and it would vest both authority and responsibility In those who were best qualified by knowledge and interest to exercise the oiie. ami who, be canse of direct proximity, were most amenable to tbe other. The proposed system has, more over worked well In places in which it lias been tried. It would not be difficult to name cities which are enviably noted for their prosper growth and progress, ami equally for tbeir»fr«e dom from the evils of the liquor trade. ■ id which owe their happy condition in Uy named respect to the operation of pcei Isety sm '; local excise hoards .-•« this commission pro- The evil conditions reported by the commis sion are well known to exist. It is not to be expected that anybody wit] venture to deny that fact. Neither Is it Bupposablgjhat any one will havo the shamclessness to defend them and to demand that they shall be left undis turbed. It must be generally conceded, that a radical reform of tho liquor trade Is India aensable, and it needs no handwriting on tbe wall to give warning that the people of th*» stair will doI condone neglect of the subject; but If Ibe Incoming Legislature will not denl with it satisfactorily they will nexi year elcirt another that will do so. The Excise Commis sion, composed of men of exceptional informa tion, experience and judgment, baa earefu studied the situation, has reported facts whi b will not be denied, and has made its recommen dntions for reform. It will rest, with the Login lature to which those recommendations nre presented either* to adopt them or to bring forward and enact some alternative plan whtch will accomplish the purpose equally well —If isuch an alternative can be found. in sny rasa, the earnest demands of the Governor, in which he Is cordinlly Knpprnrt»rl by an ovenvb^'ning majority of tl>,- pan* of the state of nil fjrttaij must be heeded and mn.l* effective •■•' tw abatement of conditions vrbich liaye become »■ tolo, {ible. . •> .
