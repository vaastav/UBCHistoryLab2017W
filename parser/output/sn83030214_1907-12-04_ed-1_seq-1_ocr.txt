Washington, Dae. — Ambassador Aoki has )ieen summoned to Japan by his government to explain personally a:.d In detail the precise sit uation in this country in regard to the Japanese immigration problem and other matters in which Japan is urterested jointly with the : United States, He talked briefly and reservedly j this afternoon regardinK the instructions givea j Mm to return home, lie appeared, though, to j be in cheerful mood. "I am going home," the ambassador said, "for ! the purpose of making a verbal report to my government: There are- many thtoga to report on— things that I have beard and seen in this country. They can l>e made better verbally than in vriting. There is no other significance to the visit. I shall discuss immigration, in ;!il'2it!on to oth»-r questions in which my govern ment is • rested. "My return cannot be oanstrued In any way r<> an indication of anfrlendUness "n the part of Japan for the United States. The American government knows very weli that Japan Is dls- I tioped to be one of her best friends and to re main on terms of the greatest amity with her. Any other idea or suggestion is foolish to en tertain. •■Xh-- question of the adjustment of the lmml gration difficulty is not at ail ■ bi rious one. and in my judgment it will be settled satisfactodjly. My return, I repeat, has no bearing on the re lations between the United States and Japan, our relations are Crieadly. and I hope will re ir.ain the same. There Is no reason why they should be therwlse. but, on the contrary, every reason v. : y they should continue good." "How kmg will you remain in Japan?" "That I don't know." -Are you coming back?" he. was a^ked. "That I don't know," 1: replied ■■ a in. Viacouat Aoki, if time permits, v.i!l look into ! tbe saersl bjmjsHuu of Japanese immigration on the Pacific Coast before he sails for home, lie had intended <I<>inp this earlier In the year, j and had practically made all arrangements for j i trip to the Coast. For what seemed good rea sons, however, the trii> for the time was aban- Inmnl The Japanese government is anxious to hear from the ambassador personally the reul Pituatlon on the Coast, as he views it, and he ndicated to-day that he would make it a mat ter of inquiry on his way home. Viscount Aoki has been making careful in quiry on his own account and through the va rious Japanese consular officers into the extent sf the reported race feeling existing in some sections of the United States toward Japanese immigrants. Baron Ishii. one of the secre taries cf the Japanese Interior Department, baa made an investigation of conditions existing not only in California, Oreeon and Washington, but Bias in British Columbia, upon which he has based a special report to his government. It is believed the purpose of the Japanese govern ment in summoning Viscount Aoki to Tokio Is to obtain from him information which Baron Ishii could not possibly have acquired during his short stay In America regarding the atti tude of the administration here, with particular reference to the. measures which recently hay» been applied by the Japanese government to re strict the departure from Japan for America of the coolie element. Also the Japanese govern ment desires a prudent forecast of the likeli hood of Congressisonal action in the direction sf legislation providing for the exclusion of Japanese immigration. At the State Department it was learned to-day That Viscount Aoki did not present any letters or recall, but he had received a summons to re turn home for consultation with his government. It was not known at the department whether he would or would u-it return to the United States, The impression there was that tho ambassador himself v.as not aware as to what his future movements would be. He received word late Saturday that his government wanted him to return home, and he lost no time in acquaint •T>tr the State Department with that fact. The most positive statement ls made at the Japanese Embassy that Viscount Aoki's recall hi not the result of any dissatisfaction with h's course on the part of his government, or that in his recall his government in any way dts uvows his actions while here. Th** ambassador expects to leave W;>.shinßton on his homeward trip before Christmas, Dur !np his absence Mr. Miyaoka, the counselor of the embassy, ■will act as charjre 1 d'affaires. 

TALK OF SUCCESSOR. Baron, Kaneko or Baron Chinda May Take Aokis Place. Tokio, Dec. 3.— The probable resignation of Viscount Aoki, Japanese Ambassador to the T'nited States, has been rumored for some weeks, but th--: rumor has been persistently denied. It is admitted now, however, that Ambassador Aoki will return to Japan at an early date. Tha Foreign Oltice declines to say if this means his resignation. In the event that A mbassa.fi or Aoki decides not to return to Washington, there- is a strong rrrbai.ility that he will be succeeded by Baron Kaneko. a former special envoy to the United States, or by Baron Ctnada, vice-minister at the Fireipn . OfSce. Baron Chinda Is well known in America, where be was educated. He Is both tlve and staeere in endeavoring to overcome the Iwinigi'sHsii difficulty, f He Is also extremely friendly with Americans and thoroughly conversant with the •world. KOIKI-: OFF FOR COAST.

CHANLER FOR HUGHES Compares Him to Cleveland — Become President, He Says. , Lieutenant Governor Chanler. speaking at a dinner of the Hotel Men's Association of New York State at tho Waldorf, last night, aroused much enthusiasm by comparing Governor Hughes to Graver Cleveland, and < xpressing the opinion that ho might, like Mr. Cleveland, be come President. Later Mr. Chanler was asked by some one if it was not strange that an Inde pendence League smcial should praise a Repub lican Governor, and he replied that lie had done nothing except praise and admire Governor Hughes since his arrival at Albany. Mr. Chanler said that public opinion was moulded and ttreeerved In th« email towns of the state, and that the hotel men had much to do with shaping it. He said that tho time when the American people had their opinions made for them was over, and that now discussion of public topics was responsible for public opinion. Then he said: "We have at Albany as Governor a. man to whom the eyes of the whole people are turned, because Governor Hughes has done his duty not only as Governor of the state, but as Gov ernor of the people al;»o. But Is he the only i honest Governor the state ha* ever had? No. I would call to your minds a Kan who travelled the same road as Governor Hughes, as honest. as fearless, who ultimately became, as Governor Hughes may yet become. President. "And yet. did be receive^ as Governor Hughes ! is receiving, the rapport *»f all good, thinking, ! sensible people? No. Because party feeling ran too high and public opinion was dominated by i party Ideas and T""p' ( were not ready to accord ! enthusiastic support to all good work, no matter ( what the party of its performer." Martin H. Glynn. the State Controller, wrui another speaker. Mr. Glynn said he had in tended to speak on financial topics, but tcld a lot of stories first, and wound up by saying that there wouldn't have been a panic if people had spent less time taking money out of one bank i to keep financier- from getting it and pitting it ! back Into another to keep burglars from get : tfng it. • O\ |f\ F. 

WALKER'S TRAIL, Nero Britain Embezzler Headed for Santiago Last Month. (By TiliHl«l>ti *° Thm Tribune. I Hartford. Conn.. Dec. iJ.— A telegram ad dressed to Governor Woodruff to-day from Sec retary Root said that William F. Walker, the embezzler, sailed from Enaenada on November 14 for Santiago. •Walker was treasurer of the New Britain Sav ings Bank. In February he disappeared with negotiable securities amounting to $560,000. H* also made big inroads into the $75,000 fund of the Connecticut Baptists, of which he was also Ireasurpr. This was made known after a ten tative report of his accounts had be«n made a week after his disappearance. Besides his connection with th^ New Britain Bank. Walker was one of the chief pillars in the First Baptist Church of New Britain. Ho had •an apparently bonoraMe career of sixty taree years, when he left, presumably for health, and his defalcation was discovered. It is be lieved that ■ MX reward is still out for Walker's apprehension. j PANIC REACHES TURKE Monetary Difficulties Here Held Responsible for Failures. ; Constantinople, Dec. 4.-As a result of the j monetary -jltlcs in the United States a series of failures have occurred here recently, culminating to-dar in the suspension of a bis Armenian . banking and commercial estsbiiab ment in Starnboul. the Mahometan part of thi.s city.

In the message of President Roosevelt to the GOth Congress at Ka openinff session, read yesterday, the following are the chief recommendation* : Provision should be made for an emergency currency, to give greater elasticity, but ot the same timo to assuxo safety and security. It must be based on an effective guarantee and under a heavy tax to secure Its retirement vtwn tbe demand falls off. Tbe tariff laws should be caref-lly scrutinized every dozen years or bo to see that no improper benefits aro conferred, bat the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately after a Presidential election. The duty on «roe* pulp should be repealed, with agreement with Canada, if possible, that there be no export duty on It from that country. There would be no temptation for <i»rporatio!is to contribute to campaign Mb* and no need of such fund 9 if Congress provided an appropriation for tbe proper and legitimate ox penses of each of the great parti.-s. ample enuugb for tho purpose, with the restriction that no more than a fixed amount should be received from any Individual.

No corporation should be permitted to engage in foreign or interstate commerce which is formed for or whose operations create s monopoly in any on.> or more of the prime noo.* sltles of life or articles of general use. V general law could be enacted under which existing corporations could take out federal charters and new <<orroratlous could be created. If an incorporation act Is deemed inadvisable a license act for big IntersUte corporations might bo enacted, or the two could be combined.
