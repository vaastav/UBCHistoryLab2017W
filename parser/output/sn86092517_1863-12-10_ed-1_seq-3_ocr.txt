State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefit* of the constitutional provision wWch declares that the IT. S. shall guaran tee to every State in this Union a republi can form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion, and on ap plication of tbo Legislature or the Executive when the Legislature convened, against domestic violence. And I do furtberproclaim, declare and make known that anv provision which may be adopted by such State Government in rela tion to the treed people of such State, which shall recognize and declare their per inanent freedom a^ provide for their edu cation, and which may yet be consistent, as a temporary arrangement, with their pres ent condition as a laboring, landless and homeless class, will not be objected to by the National Executive. And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loy al State government in any State, the name ' of the boundary, the sub-division, the con- 1 stitution and the Federal code of laws as bef ro the rebellion, be maintained, subject oniy to modifications made necessary by the conditions herein before mentioned, and such others, if not contravening said con ditions, which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new State government. To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far 3S it relates to State governments, has no reloreece to States wherein loyal State gov err.ments have all the while been maintain el. And for the sarao reason it may be proper to lurther say that whether rnein ' hers sent to Congress from any State shall 60 admitted to seats, constitutioually rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and imt to any extent with the Executive, and *till further that this proclamation is in tended to present to the people of the Slates wherein the national authority has j been suspended and loyal State governments ti&ve been subverted, a mode by which the national authority over every loyal State government, may be established within said States, or any of them, and while the mode presented is the best the Executive can present with his present im pressions, it must not be understood that mother possible mode would not be ac ceptable.

Wo return thanks to those young men who favored us with a serenade last evening. The "banjo solo" was excel lent. It is astonishing the amount of buisness that A. M. Adams ?? Co., do. One of the firm is East every four or five weeks and if there is any new styles of cloths, oassimers or vestiugs they are the first to have it, and of the best quality. Persons in want of the best article of clothing and at fair prices had better call and examine their endless variety of cassimeres and vestings. Their facilities for catting and making fashionable garments are unequalad in the city for taste and style. uov 14 6m J LEGISLATIVE _PROCEEDINGS. SENATE. Wednesday, Dec. 9, 1863. A message from the House annonnced that it had insisted upon its disagreement to the Senate's substitute for the House Bill for tho establishment of a system of free schools, and asked a committee of con ference, which was agreed to. The House has agreed to the amend meats of the Senate to the House Bill in relation to the fees of justices and consta bles. Mr.Maxwell offered a resolution dispens ing with the office of door keeper of the Senate after the present session, but sub sequently withdrew it. Mr. Bunker offered a resolution, which was adopted, allowing the pages of the Sen ate $1 25 por day during the present ses sion. Tbe bill making appropriations for the payment of certain militia claims was taken up and passed. The bill making provision for Uaiou men who havo been robbed by rebels was taken up, but was subsequently laid on the table without action. On motion of MfvHubbaiJ, the Senate took a reccs?. 

HOUSE OF DELEGATES. Wednesday, Dec. y. Prayer by Rev. John Moffat. A communication from the Senate an nouced the passage of House Bill No. Lr>3, providing for the appraisement of property stayed by the provisions of the Stay Law, with amendment*. The amendments were agroed to. Also that Senate Bill No. 4b, making ap propriations for the payment of certain militia claims had been passed The Bill was read a first time. The vol# by which tbe services of a door keeper for the House were dispensed with, was reconsidered, and the resolution in definitely postponed. Mr. M'Grew offered a resolution, which was adopted, authorizing the Clerk of the House to send, as soon as possible, either by Express or mail, as he may think most ju dicious, to the Speaker and members of the House, such portions of the Acts and Jour nals as they may be entitled to, and as have not already been delivered to them. Senate Bill No.*3, providing for issuing grants for land in certain cases, was taken up. Mr. Bee favored the immediate passage of the Bill; it had been before the House for many months, and wa9 porfectly understood by all. He was surprised to see any man oppose the Bill. Were we to wait until the Southern Confederacy was subdued before we take any action about these lands. Mr. Wheat also favored the bill ; if the House failed to pass this Act, which had been before it for several months, and had probably ouat some twenty-tivo thousand dollars, it would have been far better for us if we had adjourned six wetks ago. No body can toeeanyting bv tbe passage of the bill, while many will be greatly benefitted by it. Mr. Hagar was opposed to the bill j If we passed it we would be doing great injury to the people of the border connties- In his county, (Boone), he ijnew many men who would lose tbeirsproperty if this bill was passed. The report of the committee was adopted, aud the Bill is passed by the House. Mr. Wheat moved to take up the Bill extending the Stay Law until the first day of March, and called for tbe yeas and nays on the question. The motion was lost. Yeas ? Messrs.

"tie observed that many were leaving, and would make this remark for their information. House adjourned. Up to 2 Q*Clock. A.. M, New Yoi-K^Dec.* 8. ? The rtport of the Secretary of War is of conaidarabla length. It raviewa our victories and pays high tri bute to the bravery and skill of our troops. He says the combined operations of our army and navy against Charleston have not as yet accomplished what was expected of them. In Texas, a large force operating under Banks, will give protection to the people of that State, and cut off a chief av enue of the rebels for foreign commerce and foreign aid. The armies of Lee and Meade now occu r y relatively the samo positions that the j did at the date of the last annual roport West Virginia is now clear of rebels, and the people of that State are enjoying in compar ative peace the blessings of civil govern* ment. , The rebel forces in Missouri hare been driven beyond the Arkansas river. No military operations of any magnitude have taken place in Virginia or North Uar olina. ? . . . The Federal forces are new firmly plant ed in every rebel State. The success of our arms during the oast year has enabled the department make a reduction of over 200,000,000 in the estimates fur the ensuing year. The trouble in regard to the exchange of prisoners is reviewed at length, and the blame for the non exchange is thrown en tirely upon the rebel authorities. He al ludes to the good treatment the rebel pris oners have recaived at our hanps, and he denounces the rebel authorities for the' cruel manner in which they have treated our prisoner3 in their hands. He than dis cuses the act of Congress or enrolling and calling out the national furces and says the law has been enforced in 12 States, yielding 50,000 soldiers and ?10,000,000 for procur ing substitutes. i The $300 clause is allnded to, aud the conflicting opinions in regard to it? justice and injustice. Ho sayl a large portion ol the troops whose terms expire next year will reenlist, it being stipulated by the Government that they shall have at least one month's furlough before their present term expires. The indications are that the force required will, in a great measure, be raised by volunteering and without a dratt. An appropriation for bounces should be maee. He speaks of the valuable service rendered by the Invalid corps, now num bering 20,000, officers and Privates. Immediately after the issuance of the President's proclamation, dilligeut efforts were commenced and have continued until the present time for raising colored troops. Fifty thousand colored men are now organ ized and the number will rapidly inerease as our armies advance. The treed slaves make rood soldiers and are easily disciplin ed and are full u? courage. The slave has proved hii manhood and capacity, and makes a good iuiauiry, artillery or cavalry soldier as has been evidenced on several oc casions The eolorod troops havo been allowed no bounties under the construction given by the department. They can only by the existing law receive 10 dollars per month for their services, while white soldiers re ceive 13 dollars with clothing and a daily The fortunes of war have brought within lines large numbers of colored women and children, and some aged and infirm persons. A solemn trust rests upon the government for their care and protection, the AUJ Gen. reeommends the term of enlistment in tha regular service be fixed at three years instead of five, in accordance with the act of lbCl, whioh expired by limita tion on the 1st of Jan'y 1H03. The Sec y rives a list of the principal ordnance ma terials in the control of the department at tho beginning of the war, &c., and thequan tities of these articles whicn have since bceu procured, and the quantities of thoae ajtioles on hand June 30tb, 1863. lhe fig ures are immense. The operations ol the chief eugineer connected with the survey ei the northern and northwestern Lakes have j been continued and during the past season j consisted in the survey of postage entry on Lake Superior, and in rasuming the survey of Greeu Bay and Lake Michigan. Also the examinations of the channels ol J the St. Clair flats and of St. George. Also . of St. Mary's river, Ac. j The details of the Quartermaster Gener-I al's department are also given. Also the report of the Commissary Geu eral of subsistence. It is believed that the tioops at every point have been supplied with an abund ance of wholesome lood and that if iu movement of the armies temporary wan has been fait it has not been duo to any want of foresight or apprehension on the pa.i t ot the Commissary General a depart 111 Alter alluding to soma claims againts that department and saying that further legislation or a larger appropriation l will required to carry them into elfect, he con cludes as follows: 1 may express the the hope that the next annual report from this Departmet may an nounce the complete overthrow of tho re , bellion and restoration of peace, with the j establishment of the Union ou a sure foun | dation. 1 Dr. M, F.
