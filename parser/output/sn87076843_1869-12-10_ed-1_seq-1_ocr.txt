In a 8hoXlro(iwBt)infrHd)i of hi, fttkiji to the ranks of the people who nave confer- red upon a bur honors, and account is r them for onr stewardship. I earnestly desir t that neither you nor I may be condcrnnctf .by free and enlightened Cohstltusricr, ' nor by our own consciences.' l 1 Emerging from a rebellion M' gigantic magnitude, aided, as it was, by, the sympa thy fend ftssisUude f .tukiioriK wrthTrrbera we were at peace, eleven" States bf the f tTt)Ion"wr four years ago left withxiai legal State Governments ; a debt had been contracted ; Atneriean commerce was al most driven from the--seas; the industry ,of one-half Che country had been taken from 'the control of the capitalist, and placed where all labor rightfully belongs, in the Veepmg of the laborer. The work or restoring the State Governments loyal to the Union,, of protecting and fostetmg free, labor and providing means for paying .the interest on the pubHo- debt, bA-e-eived ample attention from) Congress. Although your efforts have not met with the success in all particular that might -have been desired, yet, e the .whole they have been more successful than could have been reasonably anticipated. 8evn States iwhich ' passed ordinances of secession, have been folly-restored to their places In the Union: The eighth (Georgia) held an election, at which she ratified her Consti tution , republican in form, elected a Gov ernor, members of Congress, a State Leg islature, and all other officers .required. The Governor was duly installed, and the Legislature met and performed alltiie.aqtg required .of them, by Jheaastxuctjon acts ef Congress. Subsequently, I kur4 ier, in violation of the Constitution which they had just ratified, as since decided by the Supreme Court of the State, thev,uji : seated the colored .members pf tHe,Legla--latare and admitted to seats soma mem bers who are disqualified by the third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution an article which they themselves had contributed to ratify. Under these circumstances I wonld submit to you- whether it woald not be wise, with out delay, to enact a law authorising the Governor, of Georgia! to ' convene ' the members originally elected to the Lcgis . lature, requiring each member to take the ' oath' prescribed ,' by: the Reconstruction ' act, and none to be admitted who are In eligible under the third clause pf the! Fourteenth Amendment. , The freedmea;' under 'the protection which they have received, are making rapid progress in learning, and no com plaints are heard of a lack of industry on ,their part when they receive fair rejnuner- 'atton for their labor, -iaavu i . The means provided for paying the In terest on the public debt, with all the other expenses, of the Government, are more than ample. The loss-of our com merce is the only result of the late rebel lion which has not received sufficient at tention from you. . To this subject I call your earnest attention. I will not now suggest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if necessary, make it the subject of a special message during the session of Congress. 1 . 1. At the., March term, Congress,. by joint , , resolution, authorized the Executive to or . dpr an election in the States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, submitting the con stitutions, which each had previously, in ? Covention, nratnod.and submitted, the constitutions,, either; entire or in separate parts, to be voted upfn at the discretion ,-oX. the Executive. Under this authority -n the election war called. In Virginia the . election took, plac on the Clh -of July, J ' toon. 1 n uovrnor ana uouienani 1 Governor -elected have been installed. The ' 'Legislature met and did all required by this resolution and by all the reconstruc tion acts of Congress, and abstained from all doubtful authority. I recommend that her Senators and Representatives be ad mitted, nd. thiU 'the, . Stat ' be fully restored to its place In the family of States. ' 'Election were called In Missis sippi and Texas, to commence on the 80th of November, 1869, and to last two days in . Mlllppl and four day in Texan. The ' elections have taken' place, buf the result is not known. - It is to be hoped that the act of the Legislatures of these Stfetes, when they meet, will be such as to receive ytout approbation, and fhu close the vjorls of reconstruction' . " L' 1 Among the evils growrbg'orit oTthe re bellion, and not yet referred to, is that of n ' irredeemable currency.- It . -i'. an S1-..bpJ X bopq will receiy your L-ai at aUsntua. ilt M d(ty, and . one of the highest duties of the Govern ment, to secure to the citizens a reSium ' of exchange of fixed unvarying' vnlue.

It should he commenced sow and reached at the" earliest practicable moment consistent ' with a Uit regard, to the! interest Of the 0 debtor elas Immediate resnraption, if practicable, would not be desirable.

The report bf lueSoorilary ol tLaTioaO ury shows the receipts of the govern ment for tb fiscal year ending .Juno 80, 1800, to be 9370,943,?4T, and the expendi tures, Including intereet, etc., to be $321, 400,635. The eStunatBfcth Ensuing: ! year are more favorable to the govern ment, and will, no doubt, show a large de crease of the public debt. The receipts in the Treasury beyond, xpenditurcs have exceeded the amount necessary to place to the credit' uf ihw rtnlctriirftnirlr'aBiJruvldwI by law. To lock up the surplus in the Treasury, and withhold it from circulation, would lead to such a contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and seriously affect the prosperity of the country. Un der these circumstances the Secretary of the Treasury and myself heartily con curred in the propriety of using all sur plus currency in the Treasury in the pur- chase of government bonds, thus reducing the interest-bearing debt of the country, and of submitting to Congress the ques t'on of the diDOsition-tobe -made of--the bonds so purchased! The bondarnovt held byjthe Treasury amount to about $75,000, Ox), including those belonging to the sink ing fund. I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of ,ths sinking fund.

The office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue is one of the most arduous and responsible under the government. It fall but little, if any, short of aCabinet position iu its importance and responsibilities. I would ask for it, therefore, such legislation as, inyour judgment, win phce the' office ona lDotingof dignity cornmensaratewlth its importance, and with a character and qualifications of the class of men required to fill it properly. As the United States is the freest of all nations, so, too, its people sympathise with all people struggling for liberty and self government ; but while so sympathising. it is due to ourJionQr.yiat wo stain from enfirinaur vlawu fapoiiiib wining nations, anu rrom taking an inter ested part, without invitation, in the quar rels between different nation or be tween governments and their.

The conduct of the war between the allies and the Republic of Paraguay has made the intercourse with that country difficult that it has been deemed ad- visable to withdraw our representative ; L- iTowanf the closrfof thi las Adminis- Kratlow a Convention was AgneA at Mn-: aon Tor the settlement of all outstanding claims between Great Britain and the United States, which failed to receive the advice nd consent of the Senate to its ratification. The time and the circum- stances attending the negotiation of the treaty were favorable to its acceptance by people of the United States, and its were wholly inadequate for the of tho gross wrongs thot had. been sustained by this Government, as well as bv its citizens. The iniunes result- inr'to tbe Urntol State, by ftafcafof (trie our late civil war, in increased rates of in surance, in the diminution of exports and imports, and other obstructions to domes tic industry and production, in its effect upon the foreign commerce of the country, Id the decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine, in the of war and ptbotnaO'trcasik auiWli increased cost. ves, of its sup pression could not be adjusted and satis fied as ordinary commercial claims which continually arise between commercial na tions, and yet the Convention treated thsin elinply tsuch ordinary claim from which thfc diffefjmori wjdoly in; the gravity of their character than in tho magnitude of their amount. Great even as is that dif ference, not a word was found in the treaty and not an inference could be drawn from it, to remove the sense of tbe-nnfriextdll-ncss of the course of Great Britain in our struggle for existence, which had so deep ly and universally; impressed Itself upon the people of this country. Believing that convention thus misconstrued in its scope Ad made quite different in its pro Vwion would not have produced tho hearty," cordial settlement of tho pending questions which alone is consistent with tne relations which I desire to have estab lished between tjje United tates and flenatef nrrelectin'ir the- treaty, to iinve been wisely taken in the interest of peace, and as a necessary step in the direction of v per feet and cordial friendship be- 4 twoatw Ui- two countries. A sen sitive people, conscious of their power, are more at ease under a great wrong wholly unatoned than under the restraint of a settlement whieh satisfies neither their ideas of justice nor their grave sense of the grievance they have sustained. The rejection of the treaty was followed by a Blate of public feeling on both sides, which I thought not favorable to an immediate cordingly so instructed the Minister of the Eid ted States o Great Britain, and fcitnd fliat myrvief hi n rpgird were uari4iy herMj V Xuikrl I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two Governments can approach the solu tion of this momentous question with an assurance of what is due to the rights, dig nity and honor of each, and with the de termination, not only to remove the cause of complaint in the pst, bet to lav the foundation of a road -principle- of Tublic law, which will prevent future differ ences, and tend to firm and continued "peace and friendship.

The. ex tension: rf railroad to Europe and the East is bringing into Competition with our agricultural products, like product of other countries ; self-interest, if not self-, preservation, therefore, dictate caution against disturbing any Industrial interest of the country.

A tbe United.

T'MrA among these is strict tiiUray In fuUUUn all our obli gatunuL Sceoud, To secure protection to lU0.p(u) jPd, property of our couiuiou country, wnevcr ii ny choose to ruein without reference to original nationality, rvlljrlou, tolor, or politic, duufendUtf of him only obedience to the law and proper respect forthe rights of otto'r. Third, A union of all the Stato with equal rii?ht imlcstrurtible by any uiictMutlilutioiud inrtina. . . . To secure , the first of these Congres ba taken two essential steps. First, In de claring by Joint resolution that the public debt should be paid prlnctnt and lutcrrat In coin. . Second, by providing means for . paying, v The measures, however, could not secure the object desired with out proper administration oi the laws for colhctlnTf the revenue end economical disbursement of theui. To this wibjert the administration has moxt earnestly ad dressed itself, with, results, I believe, satis factory to the coimiry. There has been no hcaitatiua in disusing olUvutls in order to secure the efficient execution of the laws; sometime, too, where In ft mr party view undesirable . political results were likely to follow tor any hesitation iu snstalnlng efficient officials against remon-. strancee wholly political. It may bo well to mention bsra embarrassments possible to ferise from- Iraving on the statute Ixniks the sotclled,Te.nure of O(fico net, and to earnestly recommend Its total repeal.' It amid not have been Uio intention of the trainer of the Constitution, when providing that appointment made by tbe President shonld re ceive the consent of the Senate, that the latter should have the power to retain in office persons placed their bv Federal appointments against the. will of the Pres ident. 'The hw Is inconsistent with fe faithful fend efficient administration of the government. What faith can the Execu tive put In officials forced upon him, and those, too, whom ho has suspended for rtasont - IIow will such official servo an administration which they know does not trust themf For the second requisite to our growth and prosperity, time and experi ence will a HI rm ; but a humane administra tion of existing laws, amended lrom time to time, as they may prove ineffective, or prove harsh aud unnecessary, are probably all that are required. The third cannot be attained by special legislation, but must be regantod as lived by tho Constitu tion Itself, and gradually acquiesced in by fbre of public opinion. From the foundation of the Government to the present, tho management of the original inhabitant of this continent, the Indians, has been the subject of embar rassment and expense, and has been at tended with continuous Tobberies, mur ders and wars. From my own experience upon tho frontiers and Indian countries, I do not hold either legislation or thoconduct of the whites who como most in contact with Indians blameless for their hostilities. Tho last,i howewr, cannot bo undone, and the question must bo met as we now find it. I lie ve adopted a new policy to ward these wards of 'the nntionthey cannot be regarded In any other light than as wards with fair results so far as tried, and which I hope will bo attended ulti mately with great success. The society of Friends is well known as having succeed ed in living in peace with the Indians iu the early settlement of Pennsylvania, when their white neighbors of other sects In other sections were constantly embroil ed. They are also known for their op position to all strife, violence and war, and are generally noted for their strict integrity and lair dealings. Thcso con sideration induced me to give the manage- msni oi a lew reservations oi Indians to them, and r to throw the burden of tho selection of agent upon the souitty itself, and the rcsull.has'nrovon most satisfactory. It will be found more fully set forth in tho report oi tne uommtssioner or Indian Affairs. For Superintendents and In dian agents not on reservations, officers of the army were selected. Tho reasons for tbisjare numerous. When Indian)agents are sent there or near there, troops must be sent also. Tho agent and tho com mander of the troops are Independent of each other, anu are subject to orders irom the different department of the govern ment. The army officer holds a position for life, th agent one at the will of the President The former is personally in terested in living 4a harmony with the Indian and tho establishment of per manent peace, to the end that some portion of hi life may be spent within the limits of a civilized section ; the latter has no such personal interest. Another reason is an economic one, and still another hold which the government has upon a life officer: to' secure a faithful dis charge of duties in carrying out a given policy. The buildingof railroads and the access thereby given to all th agricultural and mineral regions of their country is rapidly bringing civilized settlements in contact with all tribes of Indians. No mat ter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aborigines, the fact Is they do not harmonize well, and one or the other has to give way in the end. A system which looks to the exter mination ot a race is too horrible for a na tion to adopt without entailing upon Itself tbe wrath of all Christendom and' engen dering in the citizen a disregard for hu man lite and the rights of others danger ous to society. I see no substitute for such a system except in placing all tho Indians on large reservations as rapidly as can be done, and giving them absolute protection there as soon as they are fitted for it. They should be Induced to take their lands in general aud to set up terri torial governments for their own protec tion. For full detail on this subject I call your special attention to the report of the Secretary of Interior and tbe Com missioner of Indian Affairs. The report of the Socretary of War thowa the expenditures of the War De partment for the year ending the HOlk of June, 119, to be $80,644,043, of which $1,882,301 was disbursed In the payment of debts contracted during the war, and is not chargeable to the current army ex pense. Tho estimate of J3 l,.Vil,0;il for th expense of the army for the next fis cal year is as low as it is believed can be relied on. Tbe estimates of Bureau of ficers have been carefully scrutinized and reduced wherever it has been denied prac ticable. If, however, the condition of the oountxy should be such by the beginning of the next fiscal year as to admit of a greater concentration of troops, the appro priation asked for will not be expended. ;The appropriation etimale for river and harbor imorovements and ior fortifications. are submitted separately. - Whatever amount Congress may deem proper to ap propriate for these purpose will be expended. The recommendation of the General of the Army that rpproptlatlons be made for the forts at Bosun?, Portland, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans and San Francisco, if lor no other, is con curred in. 1 also ask your special atten tion to the recommendation of the Gene ral commanding the military division of the Pacific for tbe sale or tne wl island of St. Paul and St. George, Alaska Terri- t m mw.A ........... t It itlir ia wtm. i 1 J WVI B u & A ,,.... uj ij.i,- plied with, or that legislation be had for the protection of the seal fisheries, lrom which a revenue should be derived.

The ex cess of expendiUire over receipts for the previous yrer amounted to a,447.Vti3; th inctvav of reveniiee Sir ixtw ovr thiweof IMS W M f.Oot.llOU, and the liter of expenditures was tDV7,!WK. The Increased revenue In 1800 excfed the Increased rev enue In UlVSby Wt7,a:M,and the Increase of expenditures In 13M was A'l.&n.&iO les than the increased expenditure In 117, showing by comparison thi gratify ing featnre of "Improvement that while the Increase or expenditures over the In crease of receipts In 1H0H was t'MW.MS, tho Increase of receipts over th In crease of expenditure In 1801) was 1.01,871. Your attention Is res- lectrully railed to reooinendallon made y tho Postmaster General for authority to change the rate of compensation to the main trunk railroad lines for their servi ces in carrying the malls for having post route maps executed, for re organizing tnd Increasing tho efficiency of special agent. ior an increase oi me mall service on tno Pacific, and for establishing mail service under the nag ol the Union on the Allan tic ; and moot especially do I call your at tenlion to his recommendation foi the total abolitlou of tho franking privilege; inn is an atiuto from which no one re ccives a commensurate advantage. It re duces the receipts for postal survlcs from tweuty-flve to thirty per cent, and largely increases i lie service to He ncrtorinud. The method by which postage should be paid upon public matter 1 net forth fully in the report of tho Postmaster General. The report of tho Secretary of the In terior shows that the quantity of public lands disposed of during the vear ending the 0th of June, 1809, ws7,MW,lM acres, exceeding that of tho preceding year by i,uiu,uu acre, wi tuia amount u.mw, 544 acres were sold for cash, and 2,737,105 acre under the homestead laws. The remainder was granted to aid in the con struction of works of internal improvement approved to the States as swamp land, and located by warrants and scrip. The cash receipts lrom all sources wero t4,472,tSU, exceeding those of the previous year, f2,840.14J. During the last fiscal year, 23,100 names were added to tho pension rolls, and 4,870 dropped therefrom, leaving at Its close, ioi,w.i. me amount paid to pensioners, including tbe compensation of disbursing agents, was, $i8,43,8tf4, an Increase of 441,1113 on that ot the previous year. The munificence of Congress has been conspicuously manifested In its legislation fur the soldiers and sailors who Buffered In tho recent struggle to maintain that unity of government which makes us one people. The addition to the pension rolls of each successive year sinco the conclusion of hostilities result in a great degree from the repeated amendments of the act of the 14th of July, 1803, which extended its provisions to case, not fulling within its original scope The large outlay which is thus occasioned is further increased by the more liberal allowance bestowed since that date upon those who, in the lino of duty, where wholly or permanently dis abled. Public opinion has given an emphatic sanction to these measures of Congress, and It will be conceded that no part of our public burden is more cheerfully borne than that which Is Imposed by this branch of the service. It necessitates an outlay for the next fiscal year, in addition to the amount justly chargeable to the naval pension fund, an appropriation)! . During tho year ending September 30lh, 1800, the Patent Olllce Issued 1.1,703 patents, and its receipts were $086,081), be ing $313,020 more thau the expenditures. I would respectfully call your attention to the recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior for uniting the duties of supervising the education of frecdmen with the other duties devolving upon tbe Commissioner of Education. If it is the desiro of Congress to make the census, which must be taken during the year 1870, more complete and perfect than hereto fore, I would suggest early action ujion any plan that may be agreed upon. As Congress, at the last session, appointed a committee to take into consideration such measures a might be deemed proper in reference to the census, and to report a plan, I desiBt from saying more. I recommend to your favorable consid eration the claims of the Agricultural Bureau for liberal appropriation. In a country so diversified in climate and soil as ours, and with a population so largely dependent upon agriculture, the benefits that can be conferred by property foster ing this bureau are incalculable. I desire respectfully to call the atten tion of Congress to the inadequate sala ries of a number oi the most important officers of the government. In this message I will not enumerate them, but will speci fy only the Justices of the Supreme Court; no change has been made In their salaries for fifteen years. Within that time tne labors of tbe Court have largely in creased, and the expenses of living Ime at least doubled; during the same time Congress has twice found it necessary to increase largely the compensation or it members, and the duty whloh it owe to another department of the government deserves, and will undoubtedly receive Its due consideration. There are many subject not alluded to in this message which migbt with propri ety be introduced ; but I abstain, believ ing, your patriotism and statesmanship will suggest the topics and legislation most conducive to the interests of tho whole people.
