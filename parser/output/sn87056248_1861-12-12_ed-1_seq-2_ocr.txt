By order of the Central Committee, C. II. RCEVE, Chairman. M. A. 0. Packard, Scc'y. We hopo our readers will pardon us for our allusions to the Chicago Tribune; but, in justice to the community, rvliere many copie3 of it are read, it should be held up by every loyal citizen as one of the most treasonable and scurrilous sheets published in the Unin. There is not an issuoof it but teems with the most bittet hatred of every principle of government, and every government official, from the President on down, that does not coincide with its views on tho i'igser question. It does not even possess the desirable quality, when properly used, of firmness, but is continually changing from bad to worse, until it now appears to have at tained the lowest depths of political deg radation and infamy. It was but a few short months ago that the Tribune chose Fremont for its Apostle and lavished upon him tho most un stinted laudations. No praise was too great for him, no opportuniij'of sounding hia glory was permitted to pass unim proved. Finally it became evident that the administration contemplated his remo val, and one of the Tribune editors was dispatched to St. Louis to look into the manner in which military matters had been managed in that Department. lie came he saw he believed that Fie mont ought to bo removed ! lie returned and related what he had seen. 1Ü3 asso ciates would not believe, and another one of them was dispatched to inquira into the matter. The scales fell from h"i3 eyes, and ho returned converted man. The other two would not believe, and the third went down to see what had changed the mind3 ot Iii associates, aud lo ! he re turned convinced. And yet the fourth, Thomas-'ike, would not believe, probably because he knew the proclivities of his associate for lying, and he went and returned, as did hig predecessors, fully convinced that Fremont ought to bo re raoved. The eye-opener which i3 said to have operated soellectually on the editors of the Tribunet was Fremont's refusal to play into their hands in the manner in which they desired. Pre vious to thi3 they wero very wroth with the President for modifying Fremont's abolition proclamation, but as they held the Chicago Post Office by suffrage of tho administration, they curbed lh;ir ire as best they could, and toon commence'. abusing Fremont, themselves. Their course relative to Secretary Cameron showed the same inconsistency ; they commenced denouncing him about the time they were lauding Fremont, and even went so far as to notiro the number of times ho was seen riding with beef con. tractors ! But now, hoar changed ! lie is ibe only one of the Cabinet entitled to their consideration, is far superior to the Pres ident in fine, he h their Alpha and Omega. What has brought about such a change? It is because that while Fre mont has been stricken down and render cd powerless, as it were, Cameron has stolen his wooly horse, and is riding him against the conservative policy of the President. Cameron ia known to be a consummate rascal ; he is not actuated by philanthropic or patriotic motives, and hence receives the unqualified endorsement of th Tribune editors. Having given tho readers the motives which actuated the Tribune in its opposition to a Constitution al method of prosecuting the war, we will fnvo a few extracts from late numbers of it which will clearly ßhovr that it 19 doing more injury to the government than any Democratic papar that has been sup-! pressed for aiding the rebellion. i The Grst extract which we make from tho Tribune, U from its issue of Nov. 22, and is the first item of reading matter in the papor: "Nine citizens cut of every ten endorse the position taken by tho Secretary of War, and repudiate that assumed by Sec retary Smith. Tho genuine (Jnion men all support tho former, and only the luke warm and rotten sustain the latter. The people My: Let every loyal man, whatev er may be his color, have the privilege of striking for the Union and human liberty. By that sign they will conquer and the Republic will be saved. Away with the llunkies." The reader cannot fail to s)e that the Tribune calls the President and all v ho are against arming the slaves, as pro tslaveryitcs and flunkic?. Speaking of the third order of Gen. Ilalieck, the Tribune, Dec. 5lh, says: 4,li will be time to discover whether military orders of this kind originate at the Capitol, or are mainly and more truly to bo traced homo to tho pro-slavery sym pathies, and chivalrous prochviiies of o(li cers who issue them." "In heaven's name, why should not his (Cameron's) recommendation (to arm the slaves) be approved by the adminis tration as they are by the people?" But tho following, from the Tribune of December 2d, is not excelled by anything which John Brown, Giddings, Garrison, or Phillips, has said: LET 

TIIC PEOri.G MOVE. The cauie of lids rebellion i? certainlv known to all loyal men. Those who still deceive them selves, cannot long retain their wilful blindness. Congress is soon to come in session for tho most important gathering it hn seen in the history of the country. It is no time for makeshift policies, no time to darken counsel with wordy harangues, and measure tint fall short of att lining any end. Slavery is the root of the present evil, and slavery or the Union must fall. Freedom nrtst triumph or the Government, with its heavy freight of the best interests of the race, must perish among iu lions. Thcro is one tivns the humM'.'-st rc ider of the Tribune can do. The voice of tho people shou'd be heard at Washington. Now is the tim to prepare and procure sign iturei t memorials to on r Representatives. We append a form of one, already b'.'ing extensively circulated in other States. Let every lover of his country sign this, or some other of similar bearing. This may be cut out or copied upon a letter shact, and it will be a work all can engage in, to roll up the list of names which will give it weight with Congress. 

MK.U9MAL OF THE PEOPLE TO CON GRESS. " PROCLAIM LIBERTY TIIItoCOIIOUT AI L THE LAND, TO ALT. TIIK INHABITANTS THEREOF." TotheConjresiof te United Stales : Tie undersigned, citizens of , State of , respectfully subniit- Thatasthe present formidable rebellion against the General Government manifestly finds its root and nourishment in the system of chattle slavery at tlie South ; as the leading conspirators are slave holder?, who constitute an oiigareli avowedly hostile to all free insttutions ;and as, in the nature of things, no solid peace can be maintained while the cause of this treasonable revolt is permitted to exist ; your honorable Lody is urgently implored to lose no time in enacting, under the war power, the oial abolition of .slavery throughout the coun try liberating unconditionally the blares of all w ho nre rebels, and, while not recognizing the right of property in man, allowing for the emanci pated slaves of such as are loyal to the Government a fair pecuniary award, in order to facilitate an amicable adjustment of difficulties; an 1 thus to bring the war to a speedy and bci.efU'ent termina tion, and in'lissoluljly to unite all sections and uli interests ot the country upon the enduring basis of universal freedom. 

TIIK CA KS?: KT IMS'Ü- SCJJS.TZKS. There wa? no little excitement amonir tho people when the news of the disagree ment between the President and Secretary Cameron was received. Tho explanation which wo publish on the first page of this i.suc, caused tho abolition, negro-wcrship-ing politicians to elongate their counte nances, and the truo Union men to look up with a new hope that all might yet be well. The President's modification of Fre mont's proclamation, gavo evidence of more stamina than his political opponents had generally given him credit for ; but Lis modification of Cameron's nefrro equality report elevates him Slill higher in tho estimation of all who support the war for tho Union, and not for abolilioniBm. The paragraphs which the President eras ed, and inserted a substitute, advocated the policy of emancipating the slaves, and arming them to fi'jht for the Union and liberty. Upon the refusal of tho Secreta ry to alter or amend this portion of his re port, tho President proceeded to erase it and insert a paragraph which has been f.ptlr termed as "harmless as a sucking dovo.M The comes of the report which had been forwarded to tho principal cities, were recalled by order of the President, and their circulation suppressed as far as possible. No act of the President has given the country such indisputable testimony that he intends to conduct the war as near in accordance with the constitution as cir cumstances will permit ; and no act of his has given such heart-felt satisfaction to the true Union men, as his modification ot the Secretary of War. m In tho ejpressive language of a cotem porary, we are almost led to exclaim Uully for Old Abe! When ho kicks Cameron out of the Cabinet, we will say it er tain. We had intended reviewing some por tions of the President's Message, but as many of the Republican papers have pitch ed into it so savagely, wo concluded it must bo nearly right. It is to be hoped that the President will get entirely right, when we may hrtpo for a constitutional prosecution of tho war, with a prospect of success. THE

Can it be that white men are to bo denied the privilege of fighting for tho govern ment which was made for them, for tho purpose of making room in the ranks of our army for the niggers ! But, we are told, tills policy is necessary to bring the war to a speedy and successful termination.

If the ni -'er can, and it should become necessary that he should, save the government, it would of right belong to him, and ho ought to have it. The Abolitionists were anxious to get I into a war with the South, and are now urging the adoption vf a disgraceful poli cy to get out of it. They aro badly whip ped now, and are talking about last ex tremities, before tho conservative, real Union m?n have got fairly to tl'htino;. Cameron's SIvj;rJ. We prjser.t the views of tho Louisville Democrat for the consideration of the con servative citizens of Indiana. It says : Wo publish this morning tho wicked est document that ever emanated from the pen of man ; and, to our shame be it con fessed, it i by ono holding high position in liio auonr;i uovernmciii. ii win ue i seen that Cameron, tho Secretary of War. has, contrary to our expectations, advoca ted tiie arming of the blacks. We have no language sufficiently strong to express our horror and indignation at such a scheme, and the bold, shameless effront ery with which it is advocated. A schema capable of being conceived only by a heart utterly depraved, i3 maintained by arguments worthy of tho mind that couceived them. The riht to arm slaves is more than queslior able; it is absolutely and entirely a damnablo crime. The proposition fills us with a sickening hor ror and disgust. Had Great Britian the right to employ Indians, and to oder so much for scalps in tho Revolutionary war? The whole civilized world has denounced it. English statesmen have branded it with tho blackest terms of opprobrium. Yet its whole black depravity is pure as tho undriven snow before the horrible proposition of Cameron. It has not one redeeming feature. It is totally, utterly wicked carrying with it the utter des tiuclion oi tho country, in the midst of brutal horrors which makes even the popular stories of St. Bartholomew appear respectable. If the policy is carried out, then the country is certainly cursed. There will be no place where tho AmerU can citizen can remain in safety ; but, in ;ho ashes of ravaged fields, burning cities, and broken and violated households, ho will curso tlia hour ho was born. The wicked, falso impression which tho Secre tary of War tries to make, that this free ing and arming will bo injurious only to the rebels, is too glaringly absurd for dis cussion. Arm tho blavea of rebels, and tho act will do as much harm to the Un ionist as tho rebel. It changes, as we have 6aid before, tho wholo contest from a sacred causo of religion and patriotism to a John Brown raid. It loses, if car ried into eirect, all the border slave States, and, wo firmly believe, some of tho con servative border fre States. It concludes the war as effectually as if a hundred bat tles had been gained by the Southern Con federacy. There is but ono conclusion to which the people will come, and that is that Mr. Cameron mu4t bo removed. When this policy was first broached, wo htated thou the necessity plainly. Tho developments ivi me commencement oi tue war, these difficulty; and yet neither the popular im same worthies announced, with evident j impulse" nor the fore hm advice can be ato more convincing than ever.

Iloport oflho Secretary of tlc In tcrior. This report, which in not sufficient gen eral interest to justify publication in full, furnishes somo interesting statistics re garding tho operations of lhe General Land office, the business of which, the Secretary states, has been sensibly affected by the decline of business throughout tho country. On thft 3'Jth September, 1CCI, there were .r5, 555, 505,25 acres of the public lands which had been surveyed, but not proclaimed for public sale. Tho lands surveyed and offered at public Bale previous to that lime, and then subject to private entry, amounted to 7C,CG2, 735,0 1 acres, making an aggregate of public lands surveyed and ready for sale of 131.213, 33Ü.C0 acres. Tho net income from sales during the last fiscal year will hardly reach tho sum of 200,000. The grants of swamp and overflowed lands to the States have absorbed a largo amount of valuabla lands, and have caused a heavy drain upon tho treasury. The claims of iho several States cover an aggicgato of 57,C05,577,10 acres' Tho bounty land warrants and scrip issued under dilfurent acts of Congress, previous to September 30, ICG I, embrace an aggregato of 71, 717,172 acres of land. The propriety of issuing bounty land warrants to tho volunteers is, tho Secieta ry Hays a subject of discussion, and must bo determined by Congress He express es his disapproval of such grants for 1G0 acres to each volunteer engaged in tho servico would absorb over one hundred millions of acres and destroy all hope of deiiving any revenue from tho public
