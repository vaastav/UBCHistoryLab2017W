Newspapers Queen's Hospital and O'Day All Take Part. Doctor O'Day says that he does not like the other doctors of Honolulu be cause they are "a gang" organized to down him and because they keep him out of the Queen's Hospital. Doctor Collins, president of the Ha waiian Medical Association, says that the doctors of Honolulu are not band ed against O'Day, but object to his wholesale charges. Personally, they have nothing against him. Secretary W. O. Smith of the Queen's Hospital board says that O'Day never asked to be admitted to the hospital. The Portland' Telegram says O'Day is a liar. O'Day says the same about the Port land Telegram. 1 O'Pay says the Bu'letin is in the same class and that a Bulletin reporter palmed himself off on him as being a representative of The Advertiser. Bulletin yet to hear from. Portland Paper's Roast. Paced with the furor that it had Taised in Hawaii by printing an al leged interview with Dr. J. Chris O'Day of Honolulu, the Portland Tele gram has printed an explanation of the details of the interview that was held in the office of that paper and which led to the printing of the gross misstatements concerning . leprosy in the Territory. The explanation is as follows: "A well-dressed man representing liimself to be Dr. John G. O'Day, tak ing a postgraduate course in the office of a leading local physician of Port land, appeared some time ago in The Telegram office and desired to be in terviewed on the subject of Hawaiian lepers. His local connections were given, and owing to his eagerness to appear in print on the subject, it was deemed necessary to determine if he came well recommended. These facts leing learned to the eager doctor's ad vantage, he was given the benefit of doubts caused by bis eagerness in wanting such an article printed. "In the interview, all of which was taken down carefully in shorthand notes, the sharp-tongued doctor un folded a startling state of alleged facts. His statements were not borne out by the general impression of the world as to conditions in Hawaii, which, of course, suggested that he was in error. But he was so eager, came so well recommended and placed himself so emphatically in the role of a knight errant championing the cause .1 and accusing Queen of the former Hawaiian government, that J)oetor O'Dav was deemed worthy of a public hearing. This The Telegram gave him. as it is in duty bound to io for anv complainant who makes out an intelligent case and gives reasonable evidence of honest relationships. 'Doctor O 'Pay's statement were not put in the paper in every instance as strong and radical as he made them. However, the lurden of the charges he made, and the full measure of credit lie took iv.fo himself for relieving Molokai prisoners who might not be lepers, were se: forth accurately and -earefu'llv. and with the most faithful Tegard for the thought expressed. "Later Doctor O'Day secured copies f the issue in which the interview ap peared, and seemed well-pleased with the report. He had stated that he in tended to te.-ome a resident of Porc ( Continued on Page Two.)

From a reported conversation on board the Canadian-Australian liner ilarama, held on its last trip down here from the Coast, it seems likely that should the coastwise laws be suspended in regard to passengers the Canadian Australian boats will make Seattle a port of call.

CELTIC CHIEF AGAIN AFLOAT At twenty minutes past twelve o'clock this morning the Brit- ish ship Celtic Chief was pull- ed off the reef into deep water and towed by the. German cruiser Arcona to the anchor- age grounds near the bell buoy. The vessel, after sliding off the coral, rode easily, and was ap- parently not injured to the ex- tent of any of her plates being loosened enough to permit the ingress of water. When the vessel finally yield- ed to steady pulling by the Arcona and' the Inter-Island steamers Hclene and Mikahala, as well as by the rising tide, the warship immediately began steaming away from the dan- gerous locality. Playing her searchlight on the Britisher, the warship steamed past the en- trance to the channel and con- tinued until she had the ves- sel in a good place to drop anchor, the Arcona pulling the Celtic Chkf stern foremost. The cruiser remained outsiae all night, with a line on the Brit- isher holding her, and keeping her searchlights playing coat in- ually on the boat and the shore. The Helene also took hold of her. She may tow the vessel inside the harbor this morning. The Arcona will take on more coal to make up for what she ' burned yesterday, and will then make haste to reach Yoko- hama before Christmas. The ac- tion of the Areona was the cause of much favorable com- ment about town during the dav. SUBSCRIPTIONS ME COLLECTED HT THE ADVERTISER other newspaper offices are also taking subscriptions.

ANDEEW Who Will Give $100,000 for 10 ARE AFTER WOODRUFF'S JOB A. G. M. Robertson and Henry E. Cooper Most Prominent Candidates. The question now agitating the minds of the members of the legal profession and the minds of some other persons, too as, "who is to succeed Judge Woodruff, who last Tuesday cabled to Washington his resignation of the sec ond federal judgeship?" Some are merely guessing and some have hopes. -. The names most : prominently men tioned are those of A. G. M. Eobertson and Judge Henry E. Cooper. A meet ing of the bar association has been call ed for four o'clock this afternoon for the purpose of endorsing some one for the position, and it is known that a determined effort will be made to have the association recommend Eobertson again. The official notice of the meet ing does not mention the name of any possible candidate, but before the meet ing was called, a letter was .being cir culated among the lawyers for signa ture, asking the president of the bar association to call a meeting for the purpose of endorsing the candidacy of A. G. M. Robertson. Although announcement of Judge Woodruff's resignation was not made until yesterday in The Advertiser, Mr. Eobertson received advance informa tion concerning it, and it is said, took immediate steps to be the first man on the ground. He put up a lightning rod or two before midnight, the cable wires being kept hot with messages to Wash ington. Yesterday Judge Cooper sprang into the arena as an active candidate, and his friends are doing all they can to get the appointment for him.

JOHN DETOR FORCED TO BE A SOLDIER OF GREECE John Detor, manager of the Union Grill, has been grabbed as a conscript and turned into a soldier. The start ling information ha3 been received by George Lycurgus from Greece, whither John Detor went about two months ago for a vacation and a visit to his old home. John is now carrying on his shoulder a big, heavy musket, while about his knees flap the skirts that form part of the uniform of the Grecian army. John is a soldier not from choice but from stern necessity and the force of circumstances over whieh he has no control. He doesn't want to be a sol dier; he would rather be manager of the Union Grill. But he ean't help himself, and unless the government of the United States goes to his assist ance, he will continue for some four teen months to stand at attention, shoulder arms when commanded, and salute the officers of the Grecian army when they stride by. As a matter of "fact, John Detor is a soldier because the officials of the government of King George laughed defiance at the United States "and snapped their fingers in the face of Uncle Sam. They made John a soldier in spite of international laws and cus toms and the numerous decisions of eourts. John is in the position of the man in jail whose lawyer told him he' cou.'dn t be arrested. The government of Greece ean't make John become a soldier but it has. John Detor left Honolulu about two months ago to visit Greece, his native ' it 4 - -1 -1 CABNEGIE, a Honolulu Library Building. GOVERNMENT PAY ; TO BE STOPPED Salaries of Employes Who Are j Delinquent in . Taxes Will I Be Held Up. On the first of January the pay of all territorial employes who are delin quent in payment of their taxes wili be held up. Treasurer D. L. Conkiing has written a general letter to the as sessors of all the taxation districts of the islands, advising them .of this fact andisking them to, Teturn to him imme diately lists of all government employes who are back in their taxes. This list includes not only those who work under the eagle eye of heads of departments and about the courthouses and other government buildings, but also the school teachers. The latter class are said to comprise a large "pro portion of those who have not paid their taxes and whose pay is to be stopped until they square themselves with the tax department. The treasurer says that he can't see any good reason why one who owes the government money should continue to draw money from the government, and he is going to see to it that what the delinquents owe is collected by taking it out of their salaries, if they will not come through themselves.

The bu reau of public instruction has barred football as a form of athletics for pupils, attending the public schools, as being top strenuous and attended by too many dangers to the players. land, which he had not seen for four teen years. Though a native of Greece, he has been naturalized and is now a fullfledged citizen of the United States. In fact, he was naturalized only a short time before he went away. And he went away feeling that he had all the power of the United States gov ernment behind him and could conduct himself accordingly. A few days after he arrived at Spar ta, John was surprised to receive a notice, bearing the big, red seal of the government of Greece, command ing him to appear before one of the Grecian officials. John had a hunch that perhaps he was to be commission, ed eonsul to Hawaii or offered a port folio in the government of Greece. But he was destined to receive a severe bump. The government official who had summoned him took about one minute to tell him that he owed his fatherland fourteen months army ser vice and he must pay up at once. John protested, claimed that he was a citizen of the United States and as such owed nobody any military ser vice. The talk didn't go. It was the army for him. and into the array he wept. Of coure. if any of John 's influential friends want to take the matter up. he can be freed, for the question as to whether or not a foreign born citizen of this country can be made. uron hi return to his native land, to do mili tary service, has been threshed out in the courts several timeS and answered in the negative.
