In a late edition of yesterday's llR* publican, tho verdict of the jury in tuo Neal ease was briefly announced. To-day we are enabled to give the lol-i lowing particulars .1 usi beiore the opening of Court yes terday afternooii, a haililf came down that i lie Neal jury had agreed upon a Verdin,. .The Court directed that Mr. Higgins be hem lor, and that Neal bo brought into the nock.

W ne remained pertec..y quiet, his gener al expression being Mini ot anxiety. •me minutes beiore Mr. Hig gins arrived,and w hile waiting tor him the jury Were brought in. The Clerk of the Court, polled the jury and tin li asked the usual ques tion, "Do you lihd the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty, in manner and form,as lie stands indicted?" A breath less silence seemed to settle over the Court room fora moment, which was broken by the voice ot the foreman of thejury as ho am-wered ina low tone "Non tit'i ltv.'' Men who had be present during tin* whole trial, and li.-tened to me chain of evidence that the State had forged around the 1 prisoner could not believe their own ears, and asking the nearest bystander if they had ht-ar.i aright, turned away thinking that an eminent Pennsylvania J udge was correct, wh. n lie said that, Out the Almighty knew what the verdict ofap-tiit jury would be," Immediately alter rendering their veidict thejury left the court room and Neai was commanded to stand up. I'heChief .Justice then said: •'Wil liam Neal, the jury you have rendered i guilty eustotiy." Neal was taken out of the Court room between the ll «. vhich has tried verdict of not -1 w ii isc barge you from tipst ves and con dacted to a carnage which was in some mjHierious manner alrejyly provided a.-d •i ing and ripidiy driven away as there were serious threats ot g him. not omy by persons out M-le bin also by many who were in the Court room. A number of the jurors were ap proached yesterday afternoon after the rendering of the\erdict, but very little information could lie obtained. Late last night, however, a repre sentative of the Hkitiu.h an succeeded in obtain ing tile following, wliieu is believed lo be correct: Immediately after retiring on Satur day evening a ballot was taken which re -aired in two lor conviction, four for acquittal, and six who had not made lip their minds. Four ballots were taken on Saturday night with about, the same result, ami about half past ten, word was sent dowu to the Judges who were stall in their parlor, that there was no h >pe of agreeing that night. »>u Sund iy jury men complained of being sick and Dr. Kirehner was called in t-» prescribe tor t hem. During Sunday a number of ballots were taken, and on the eighth and ninth, It was evident that a feeling in tin* prisoner's favor was extending, as the last taken showed that there were ho were in favor of cleai* ruing several of the seven - mg him, only two tor conviction, and three wim had no sullied opinion upon tin* matter. < >u Monday nine ballots were taken inakinn eighteen in al that had be* cast.

About half past two yesterday afternoon ihe twenty-tir d ami hist ba. lot was taken, and resulted iu a vcruict of acquittal. Oui uilormant stated that there were serer.il considerations th.it influenced ! of which the jury iu their act; was t,nat they thought the evidence of Mrs Gosscr contradictory in loaterial points, and it was hinted that if the jury had been instructed that they could have rendered a verdict of assault, *>r assault with intent to co" nut a rape, the result might have been different. some Superior to OUi«*r«.
