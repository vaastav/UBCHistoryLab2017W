"The crux of the whole matter which led to my removal was the action taken by Mrs. Storer and myself with regard to the promotion of Arch­ bishop John Ireland of St, Paul to the oardinalate. In my letter to the pres­ ident and cabinet I cite letters writ- the highest terms of Mgr. Ireland and expressing the personal wish that the country might fcroflt by his promotion .to the oardinalate. On Dec. 2, 1903, I had an audience with Pope Pius X., 'at which I transmitted a verbal note, the basis of which had been given me •by President Roosevelt. I was par­ ticularly careful in its preparation and after transcribing it into English I translated it into French and con­ veyed it to the pope.. The communi­ cation was as follows: '"He said! to me and authorized me to 897 to your holiness that the arch blshop of St. Paul is his personal Ifriend and that he possessed his who}* confidence as a prelate and as a citizen that he earnestly desired for Mgr.

SUPPRESSED CERTAIN FACTS. Roosevelt's Reply to 8torer's First .Pamphlet. Washlngtoh, Dec. 11. President Roosevelt has made public a long let­ ter addre^|4 ^to Secretary Root giving the correspondence between the pres­ ident and former Ambassador Bellamy Storer, at Vienna, and Mrs, Storer, in whichhe aays thiat Mr. Storer's refusal to answer his letters and the. publica­ tion of ^various private letters justified th§ Mr. Storei"6 ^^Sflcaiipn of private corre­ spondence' was peculiarly ungentle manly and that he (the president) had stated wiih absolute clearness his |osition, the reason why it was out of the question for him as president to try to get any archbishop made car­ dinal, though expressing his admira­ tion for Archbishop Ireland as well as leaders of other denominations. He says he thinks it well that the members of the cabinet should know certain facts, "which he (Storer) either suppresses or misstates." He says he did not resent the ac­ tion of the Storers "until it became evident that they were likely to dam­ age American interests." He says Mrs. Storer urged him to give hjr husband a cabinet place and that she stated Mr. Choate at London and "General Porter at Paris were not proper persons to be ambassadors, suggesting her husband in that connec­ tion. The president incorporates a letter from Postmaster General Cortelyou contradicting the statement that Pres­ ident McKinley had commissioned a gentleman to ask the pope,v"as a per­ sonal favor to him" and as an "honor to the country," to appoint Archbishop Ireland as cardinal. Mr. Cortelyou says the late president never made any such request. The president -declared that Mr. Storer's 'statement that he authorized Pope Pius is untrue. He says that he never received a letter from Ambas­ sador Storer giving an account of his visit to ti»e Vatican and of the mes­ sage he personally gave the pope on behalf of Mr. Roosevelt. The president's action follows the publication of "the confidential pamphlet" which Mr. Storer last week sent to the president, the cabinet and the senate foreign relations committee.

New York, Dec. 11.—Archbishop Ireland, who was a central figure in the correspondence of President Roosevelt and Bellamy Storer, just made public, is in the city at the Mur­ ray Hill hotel. When visited by re­ porter, the archbishop stated that ev­ erybody should understand the deU eacy of his position and the impro­ priety on his part of dolng any talk­ ing In regard to the subject. The visit of his grace to the city at this time is to attend the annual meet­ ing of the National Civic federation.

Paris, Dec. 11.—The press unani­ mously recognizes the extreme gravity of the religious issue precipitated by the pope's intransigeaht attitude and many papers predict a veritable relig­ ious warfare. The government's cal­ culations have clearly been upset and ne# legislative authority may be nec­ essary to enable it to cope with the situation. It having been decided that after Dec. 11 religious services may not be held without a preliminary dec­ laration under the law of 1881 the pope's orders entail the initiation of prosecutions In 36,000 bonds of ^07. communes and logically the Invasion of churches by the police for the pur* 'pose of pronouncing their dissolution and expelling the parish priests. The militant Catholics seemingly hail with joy the prospect of violffl£e, which wni eompel -the'-^ofbsing* df the churches,' with the attendant excitement of Tfelig ious passions. Mj Jaures, the Social­ ist leader, professes to believe that the Vatican has deliberately determined to test the strength of the party of reaction in an effort to Overthrow the Republlo. Socialist organs generally, how­ ever, regard the pope's instructions as being the result of the government's weakness in offering any concession beyond the formation of the cultural associations contemplated under the law of 1905 and declare that the gov­ ernment now has no alternative except to Insist on declarations being made or show the ecclesiastics the door. The conservative papers advise the government to remain true to its lib­ eral principles, contending that the more the church is intolerant and panic stricken the more authority it will need, provided the government doed not lose its head. The govern­ ment has made preparations to cope with the situation, but is keeping them secret, evidently waiting to see whether any considerable proportion of the clergy will revolt. The cab­ inet, however, maintains a resolute 'front. Instructions to the publia prosecutors have been telegraphed broadcast. Premier Clemenceau is qjioteil as saying: if the church elects to have war it will have it1 but the world will bear witness that the Vatican is like a for­ eign power trying to dispute the au­ thority of the French government."

Washington, Dec. 11. President Roosevelt has announced his intention of taking vigorous steps to put a stop to the movement which has seemed to be dragging him against his will into another race as leader of the Repub­ lican party. Int talks with public men the pres­ ident has in mind to make his friends and admirers call a halt in their at­ tempt to stampede the country into demanding that he stand for re-elec­ tion In 1908. But he has not unfolded his plans in their entirety, being con­ tent to assert that the thing he seeks can be accomplished and that he will see to it that it is. One of the Teasons brought to bear on the president by those who insist that he will be the logical candidate to succeed himself Is that William J. Bryan is certain to be the Democratic nominee and that no Republican aside from the present White House occu­ pant can defeat him at the polls. Pres­ ident Rooseyelt, however, does not be­ lieve Mr. Bryan is so strong that it may be said there is only one Repub­ lican leader who can stand any show against him and he is not willing to admit that a victory over Bryan would be a difficult matter in the abstract as matters are now trending.

The object will be to strive for better and more equitable relations among my countrymen who are engaged, whether as capitalists or wageworkers, in industrial and agri­ cultural pursuits.

By his will a large portion of his fortune was devoted to five annual prizes, each valued at about $40,000.
