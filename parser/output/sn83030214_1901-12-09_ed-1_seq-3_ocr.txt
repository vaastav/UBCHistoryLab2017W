TO OPPOSE CANAL TREATY. ;rFOET? TO UNITE DEMOCRATIC SEN ATORS—BAILEY SAYS IT IS A ONE SIDED BARGAIN IN FAVOR OF ENGLAND. [BY TEILEGBAPH TO tee TRIBtTXZ.] Washington. Dec. 6. — Efforts are being made to-night to hold to-morrow the first Senate Democratic caucus of the session. One of the 2!aln objects of the caucus is to align the minor ity solidly against ratification of the new Hay- Pa uncef ore Canal Treaty, which will be re ported favorably to the Senate the first thing to morrow by the Committee on Foreign Relations. •VThile it is a virtually foregone conclusion that the attempt thus to array the minority as a whole against the treaty will fail, still it is cer tain that enough opposition will be developed to prevent Immediate ratification, as nearly every Senator opposed to it will insist upon his right to debate the question thoroughly. However, so many of the minority already liave expressed themselves as favorable to rati fying the convention without attempting to BBCnd any of its features that the opposition. realizing their task is a hopeless one, probably -will be content merely to state their objections. and will net, therefore, undertake to force ac ceptance or their views by resorting to the old and familiar filibustering tactics. Besides, the entire discussion will be carried on in executive session, so that the usual obstructive means cannot be resorted to with any hope of success. It is known positively that Senator Morgan, of Alabama, and his colleague. Senator Pettus. would refuse to be bound by caucus instructions :o fight ratification, and there is good reason to relieve, that both Senators Heitfeld and Dubois. of Idaho, would also refuse to engage in any effort to force amendments to the treaty or de lay its ratification longer than some of their col leagues may desire to discuss its salient feat ures. bl pcir.t o* fact. Messrs. Heitfeld and Dubois sr<? i-bout as scrongly committed to the present convention as are Messrs. Morgan and Pettus. Herce. even if every other member of the minor ity should vote against ratifying the treaty on grounds of principle or party expediency, and the fifty-five Republican Senators support the measure, as it is understood they will do, there will be nc possibility of defeating- it. There is nc> longer any doubt, however, as to the firm and immovable attitude of the Texas Senators. Both jf^ccr? <~"ulberson and Bailey will do all they car. in the caucus and in the executive session of the Senate to force amendments or outright de feat. Senator Bailey to-day said that he was ur.hesitatir.gly ready to declare his position- and yave his reasons. He said: I shall never consent to the construction of an ] isthmian canal until we can build and manage that waterway as we see fit, ■ considering the wishes of no other nation except the countries through whose territory the canal will run. I regard the so-called new treaty every whit as objectionable as the old one, which was amended by the Senate after it left the hands of Secre tary Kay and Lord Pauncefote until it provided for the construction of a strictly American canal. : The new treaty takes Great Britain into partner- ; ship with us. and that is something the Ameri can people will not stand. It is worded a little mere artfully Than the original Hay-Pauncefote convention,. which the Senate knocked all out of shape, but otherwise there is absolutely no dif ference between the two efforts to bind us for ever in a compact with England in the control of this stupendous enterprise. I am tempted to say that Mr. Hay or some body is trying to trick the Senate and the Amer ican people, but that probably is too harsh a word to use until we get a fuller history of the making of the new convention. I want to re peat that. s<vfar as I am concerned, the treaty shall not be ratified until It is amended to suit the wishes and purposes of the United States. If we construct the canal under the terms now laid down it will not be an American canal, though built with our money and having- its neutrality guaranteed solely by us.r If that is - i "not a one sided bargain in favor of England, then I must confess that I do not know what a . one sided bargain is. . " . Hence I shall insist with all the earnestness and vigor at my command that the treaty be so amended as to confer upon us the right to fortify the canal if we desire to fortify it at any time, ■ and also that every vestige of the old Clayton- Bulwer Treaty be wiped out. The treaty we are now considering is essentially as bad as the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, plus the added danger , of our forever getting bound up in an obnoxious and repellant partnership with Great Britain in a work of world-wide scope and permanent character. The American people have made up : their minds to have an isthmian canal,- and it locks very much as if somebody was determined to take advantage of this for the aggrandize ment and glory of England instead of the United j States. Senator Cullom said to-night that an effort weuld be made after the treaty was reported to the Senate to-morrow to adopt a rule calling I - i Baal vote on It at 3 o'clock Friday after- 

MEASURES IK CONGRESS. SENATE TO TAKE UP NEW HAY-PA FOTE TREATY TO-DAY—PHILIP PINE TARIFF IN THE HOUSE. <By The Associated Press.') "Washington, Dec. S. — The only measure of im portance which the Senate has on its calendar tor the present week is the new Hay-Paunce- Jots Treaty, making provision for the abrogation * tie Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, and opening the ■*"«y for the unobstructed construction of an isthmian canal by the United States. Acting for the Committee on Foreign Relations. Senator Lodge -will ask the Senate to go into executive session to-morrow for the consideration of the treaty, and in each day thereafter until the con tention is disposed of. It car. be said that at this time the prospect * very strong that the treaty will be ratified. ■■I • row looks as if this result would be se •*ed after comparatively little delay. There ■*iU b» some debate, and some features of the *«cuinent will be criticised as undesirable, but there :? no probability of captious opposition. -!*icism will be aiong the ilnes indicated fey Senators Money and Bacon m the Committee r- y- r^: zr .

The principal authors of the criticism of the treaty are Southern Senators, who are. gener ally, very anxious for the construction of the BBBBi They find that all canal legislation will tied up until action can be secured on the Treaty, and they are. on this account, less liable ' " "hey otherwise would be to do anything to 

HOPEFUL VIEW The hopeful view consump tives take of their own cases is strongly in their favor. Each year is showing a larger percent age of cures. One of the best reasons for good hope is the record of Scott's Emulsion as a medicine for con sumptives. So long as the sys tem is strong enough to use med icine of any kind it can use Scott s Emulsion. The reason for its helpfulness in this disease is because of its long tolerance by the patient; one does not tire of it as quickly as other medicines and that is "fc'here the great benefit comes. *> U send you c little to try. it you Wee. ■COTT 4e BCTWNH 409 Pearl «treet. New York. delay action upon the treaty itself. The most active friends of the treaty now claim that rati fication will be secured the present week, and the opinion Is very general that ratification will be obtained before the Christmas holidays. Beyond the consideration of the treaty little business will be undertaken before the holidays. It is now generally agreed that the question of reciprocity will go over until January, probably wlthout so much as being mentioned, and it may be added that from being for a time the subject most likely to attract early attention, it has taken a position among the matters which will not be vigorously urged. When the reciproctty treaties do <ome up for consideration, there will be persistent opposition to the agreement with France and to that \\ith Great Britain covering the West Indies. There is not so much feeling over the conventions with the South American republics. The present outlook also Is against any immediate action in the Sen ate looking to tariff legislation for the Philip pines, and there are some indications that the Senate will wait upon the House of Representa tives in this matter. Probably the Chinese ex clusion action wiil be reported from committee in course of the week. The nomination of Attorney General Knox will be reported at the first executive session, but immediate confirmation probably will be an tagonized by some Senators. The House this week probably will pass a measure to meet the situation created by the Philippine decision of the Supreme Court last Monday. T*p to the present time, however, the Kepublican members of the Ways and Means Committee have not decided upon the character of th° measure which will be reported. A dif ference of opinion exists as to whether there should be a temporary enactment of the Ding ley rates on goods entering the United States from the Philippines, or whether a permanent scheme of tariff legislation for the islands should be prepared. It is understood That Mr. Payne, chairman of the committee and Mr. Dalzell. of Pennsylvania, favor the latter course. The Re publican members of the committee will meet again to-morrow. Of course, if it is decided to enact a temporary measure, the proceedure will be exceedingly simple, and it probably can be passed :n a day If, on the other hand, an entire ■dteme of tariff legislation is to be enacted, more time will be consumed both in the prepara tion and passage of the measure.
