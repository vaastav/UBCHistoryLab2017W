MORE distressing personal calamity , . .... , has happened in tins community for , . ., ... . j years than the accidental death ot Mr. Hamilton yesterday. A man of more than ordinarv attractive uresence. his friends must be numbered by the n urn- ber of his acquaintances, and his ac- quaintanceship was wide. Even lie who 1 met him only casually felt the charm ol ; , . a delightful manner, as spontaneous as it was apparently sincere. That the life i of such a man should go out as his has is especially hard to bear, especially hard to be reconciled to.

Our reeollei- tion is that this poem appeared, not ex- actly as printed above, where the "has" in the second line is an interpolation, in the Spectator magazine. From there it was copied into Littell's Living Age, an ecletic magazine printed in Boston. It is safe to say these verses, which have great merit, were printed hundreds o( .

Norcross, a note broker, of"No. 12 Pearl itiect. A glance at the office at that number showed that it bad beeti closed for some time, but further inquiry revealed the fact that Norcross had lived at Summerville, not tar from Boston. There it came out that Norcross bad been missing from borne for ten days or more, and later the underclothing was fully identified by hi mother who was able to find some of her own mending on it. Then close friend of Norcross went to New York and saw at once that the head of the dynamiter was all that re mained of their acquaintance. And the "finest police force in the world" stood around heavily and wondered bow a re porter of 27 could possibly know more than they did. It appears that Norcross was a man of good lamily who bad been recently disap pointed because he had been unable to raise money for the trial of an elevated railway he bad patented. From that, In a morose state and with, no one will ever know, what scheme in bis mind, he began to dabble in chemicals. That his experiments were probably dangerous and that he knew they were is shown by the fact that he would not allow a boy companion of those days to handle the chemical and once took from him with every lignot alarm a bottle contain ing ome mixture the boy did not know the nature of and wa not told by Nor cros.
