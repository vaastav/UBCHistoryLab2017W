TALKS OX TAKIFft Free Salt Would Sliuply Uonefll the Grant English null Trust. The English suit combine or salt trust, is composed of sixty-four suit producing firms and companies with a capital of ?2,000,000 common, ?1,000,000 preference stock to draw seven per cent interest and ?1,000,000 four and one half per cent bonds, making a total of about $20,000,000. Iu their prospectus they state that from 1878 to 1887, 10,894,880 tons were shipped in the Mercey. Of that amount 2,235,567 tons were shipped to the United States. The cstimuted production of the nult combine unnually 18 2,000,001). The profit at five shillings per ton ?300,000. After paying interest on bonds ?45,000, and preference shares ?70,000??115,000?leaves ?385,000, or $1,UL'5,000 pro Jit annually. The above calculation would give from sixty to seventy per cent profit on the cost of manufacturing the salt. Now why should not this country admit salt free of duty to benefit this huge "combine" and breakdown our own salt manufacturers? "It's English, you know." Free traders wake up! Your friends want our market without being taxed for it. "The tariff is u tax." so the parrot says. Mr. Allison, in your tariff bill remember the poor English salt trust. ' Retaliation. There is an instructive story told in the Massachusetts Ploughman of the now notorious Sackville West: Twenty years ago in Ireland a young lad by the name of John Boyle O'Reilly, while training and swearing a regiment of his countrymen to fealty to their country, ind to light for it at the right time, was jet rayed, arrested, and banished to Aus num. uue 01 liiu coun ? im uumnm-u liim was Lionel Saekville West. O'lteilly was shipped to Australia, but escaped it sea, at great rink, in an open boat, but tvas picked up by an American whaler tnd brought to America, and is now widely known a* a poet, patriot and itateaman. Hut, like Cleveland, be was n favor of retaliation. When Lord sackville Wct-t advised his countrymen, hrough Murchison, to vote for Oleveaud to aid the "mother country," J'Heilly went to Washington and urged lie President to send West home. He :onvinccd Mr. Cleveland, and O'lleilly luccecded in banishing West from Vuierica, in retaliation for West banish* ng O'Keilly from Ireland. A l'lucky Tuvkur County Woumii.

Hob Eastham says be law her plunging down the mountain iide through six inches of snow one day ivith two rides and a bear trap strapped :o her back and followed by six dogs. She ran three miles to a point where the thought a deer in full chase would ;ross, and she got there in time to see Iter hucband kill him. She is a big, Idaek-haired woman, very industrious, ivith a heart as big as her foot, and she s the mother of seven children. She is not pretty. A few months ago, for a silver dollar, she carried a valise weighing over 100 pounds, seven miles for an engineer.

Beard, of Anthony's creek, this county, hadouite an exciting adventure with an old buck* last week, lie attempted the rescue of his dog, which was trying conclusions with the deer, when he ran up and gave the deer a severe kick. This only brought his buck8hip's vengeance down on himself. Mr. Heard saved himself by his extraordiary running abilities and gutting on lop of a high fence, from which position ho was rescued by u friend who was near. The deer was one of the largest of bis kiud, having seven points to the beam, and weighing, when dressed, 148 pounds. IfuiicMty (>r the Country 1'runn. Parkmbtirg Sentinel (Don.)

PKES8 ASP T1IE JIESSAUB. Various Vinwa Takrn of Mr. Cleveland's Passionate Uttrrunces. New York, Dec. 4.?The Sun in its editorial comments on the President's message, says: The main fuct is that nowhere does Mr. Cleveland specify or even suggest any line of policy to be pursued in dealing with the question of the surplus and the taxes. The Heraldmys: It is a plain, business like report of the condition of the various departments, perfucedjby a few para?[raphs in which Mr. Cleveland speaks or more impartial laws and a stricter adherence to the constitutional methods; that monopolies and trusts shall not inor.muu lta?? that all Anuii-ii'iinunlinll hnv? a fair chance in the race of life. What be says on thin head is sensible and well put, but as the people have just elected to power a party which favors monopolies, trusts and capitalistic combinations, for the present the recent elections show that the people do not care enough about its evils. The Tribune Buys: The message is not as carefully written as the President's other official papers, but its crude or awkwurd phrases count for nothing in comparison with its mischievous tone. It would not be out of place for the Senate's reply to rebuke a Chief Magistrate who sets himself to inflame blind prejudice and passion against employers generally, whatever their personal worth or merit, und against the institutions and laws which the people huve recently sustained by their verdict. Mr. Cleveland gained a reputation for courage when no cut through disguises ami avowed for Free Trade; but he does not guin in any respect when he gives vent to personal passion in his lust unnual message. The Timet says: The whole tenor and | important truth lying at the buso of some of Mr. Cleveland's remarks are, in our judgment, somewhat obscured by I overstatement. It is pretty true that | some of the higher protective duties of tariil foster monopoly, levy taxes, not for the common needs but for the benefit of a privileged class, and imposing gross inequality upon people, but the class benefitted issmull. It does not include all or even the greater number of manufacturers. On the contrary the great body of manufacturers sufler by tho taxes that enrich the few, being compelled to pay them the cost of mate- ' rials made by the few. A PJjAKFUJ* 

ACCIDENT. T\?o Hoja Whirled Fifty Tlmen Around a 1 Clay County Star. About the last days of October, u blood curdling accident occurred at thu mill of , J. M. Hoggs,this county, which has lately been reported to us as follows: J A boy named Douglass, who had come 1 to mill, was standing near a rapidly re- < volving iron shaft, when another boy , named Young, who was standing near, ' slipped behind him aud catching up the : tail of his oil-cloth overcoat, wrapped it around the shaft. It was instantly drawn tight by the revolvingof the shaft, y and Douglass was wound in, catching Young as he went, both hoys were whirled fifty or more times around tho i shaft at lightning speed. Douglass' legs -s were both broken above the knees, and ( his thigh boues sticking out through .1 the llesli were heard to strike several times against a post that stood near. ' Young was also severely hurt, having re- J ceived a crushed foot and broken arm. j Dr. J. M. Waugh, who is waiting on Dougluss, has set his legs and thinks one of theui may be saved, but states that the other will likely have to be amputated if he recoverssullicienily to f admit of the operation. The Doctor believes that ho will lecover. I A Naval Militia SiiKKCNted. New Yokk, Dec. 4.?%aron Vanderpool, chairman of the Naval Reserve Committee of tho Board of Trade, appointed October 10, has distributed a circular seeking information and suggestions as to the necessity and feasibility of establishing a naval militia for the United .States by legislative enactment.

Cincinnati, 0., Dec. 4.?Judge Peck, of the Superior Court, on au application by a holder of Dayton & Michigan railroad preferred stock for an injunction preventing tho collection of tax by the county officers, has decided that the stock is taxable. Tho certificates of stock, he says, guarantee regular dividends to holders. This guarantee is secured by mortgage. The holders of this stock do not have tho right to vote. The court, therefore, holds that thfcy aro not stockholders but. creditors of the road, and refuses the injunction. Tli? TriiNt a Druit Failure. New York, Dec. 4.?It is officially announced this moruing on Wall street that all the negotiations for a settlement of tho railroad troubles west and southwest of Chicago have been broken oil*, and the great clearing house plan has fallen through. Tho committee, headed by President Winslow, of tho St. Louis & San Francisco road, is still in existence, but has not vet considered any new plan. The failure of the clearing house scheme was caused by the opposition of President Hughitt, of the ' Jiorthwestern road. Kmiinror Jortoph'ii Thank*. Vienna, Dec. 4.?Emperor Francis Joseph has sent an autograph letter to Count Von Taafe, the Austrian Prime Minister, in which he thanks froin the bottom of his heart all those charitable persons who in celebration of the fortieth anniversary of his accession to the throne havo contributed to the relief of the sick and needy. The peoples' action, the Kmperor says, is a fresh proof of the love for himself and their attachment to the imperial family. A Full from Grace. ilartlnMiunj Indrpatdenl. There was a time when the Wheeling ReghUr was just a bit looked up to as a respectable aud reliable newspaper. But to all intents, the time has passed. Its violent and disgraceful course in the State contest, in giving the State and its people a bad name abroad, by ita reckless and designing claims, and is condemned by honest citizens in both parties. We dislike to upbraid a brother editor, but the purity and honesty and intelligence of the newspaper fraternity should never recognize and uphold the reckless and designing course of the fygiiter.
