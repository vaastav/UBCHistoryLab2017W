We present to our readers today President Roosevelt's first message to congress. As It is his first official utterance upon questions of state it will be read witn more than usual interest and to most people we be lieve will prove a disappointment. The public had been led to expect a document bristling with bold an nouncements of policy an dinstead they are treated to an essay of gut tering generalities. Of fine literary construction, except for its length, it would make an excellent magazine article, but as a basis for legislative action by congress it is weak and un certain in most particulars. Tlie chapter devoted to the assas sination of President McKinley and to anarchy is by far the strongest portion of the message. The public press recently announc ed that nothing on earth could pre vent the president from attacking th? ship subsidy steal, but these predic tions were wide of the mark. While the president lacked the courage to openly support the measure he indi rectly gave the steal a boost that will no doubt insure its passage at the present session. Upon the tar iff, generalities again take the pla;e of specific recommendations, but he says: "The accumulation of great fortunes are not due to the tariff but to other causes operating in other countries as they operate in our own." Dut just why billionaires and trusts multiply here so much more rapidly than in other countries the president does not explain. The message further says that "Small traders were never before so well off." This probably lias refer ence to the fact that most of the small traders are now clerking in (he department stores. After saying that "tiro act to more firmly establish the gold standard has been shown to be timely and judic ious," the important subject of cur rency and the money question is dis missed with this brief paragraph. "In many respects the national hanking law furnishes sufficient lib erty for the proper exercise of the banking functions; but there seems to bo need of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial crises and financial pan ics. Moreover the currency of the country should be made responsive to tliÂ© demands of our domestic trade and commerce." The president's secretary must have inadvertently taken this paragraph from the annual address of the president of the Bank ers' Association, as the language is almost identical with that used by him to prove his contention that all greenbacks should he withdrawn and the sole right to issue money be given to the banks. Legislation on tills subject will be watched with interest. The president shows his friendship for the west by his earnest and prac tical advice upon irrigation a.nd the recommendation that the tribal rela tions of the Indians be broken up and their lands opened to settlement. The distinctive feature of the mess age is its broad Americanism and the evident desire of the president to promote the welfare of the entire people, but it shows the viewpoint of its author to he from the standing of the aristocrat and capitalist, rather than fro mamong the common people. The message abounds in many gems of finished rhetoric and thought which stamp its author as a scholar and man of affairs But the public will be disappointed because it had expected in a figurative sense to see Teddy upon his broncho wildly charg ing the cohorts of trusts and ship subsidy thieves, but iustead they see him meekly turned the other way. 

CONGRESS. The congress of the United States which on Monday convened in the city of Washington, is the 57th con gress to convene since the adoption of the cobstitution in 1788, but vast changes have taken place in both house and senate since the first or ganization of those bodies. The senate as first organized was composed of 22 members, as the con stitution was at first ratified by only 11 of the states, two of the original states (North Carolina and Rhode Island) ratified the constitution and elected their members of congress two years later. The senate, when full, is now composed of 90 members, being two from each state. But tlie greatest change has taken place in the house of representatives. The membership of the first house was 05, being one member for each 30,000 of population. The member ship of tnat body has grown to 357, being one member for each 173,901 of population. Its great size makes it unwieldy, and it is difficult to got any matter through the house. Most of the business is done by commit tees. The members who were sworn in at the opening of the session were elected in November, 1900, more than a year ago, and while they did not begin their active duties until last Monday, they have been drawing their salaries from the government since the 4th of March last. The work that is before the pres ent congress is perhaps no more or less important than that which faced the 50th congress. Aside from the legislation required on account of our new possessions, the most im portant matters to be considered will be the isthmian canal and the tariff. While President McKinley in his last speech indicated that he be lieved the time had come when high tariff should give way in the inter ests of trade expansion, it is doubt ful if any material reductions will be made, as the tariff barons are well or ganized and will fight any proposed curtailment of their profits. TAX 

DODGERS. Tlie formation of the Northern Se curities company lias given the public a line on the real value of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific rail roads. The new company proposes to take those roads at an average valuation of about $55,000 per mile. The Northern Pacific is appraised for taxation in Montana at a little less than $5000 per mile, or at about one eleventh of its real value. Tlie Great Northern is appraised at a little more than $5000 per mile, or about 10 per cent of its real value. It is reasonable to suppose that tlie valu ation put upon the roads by the Northern Securities company is tlie correct one, as they will be obliged to pay interest and dividends on that valuation. The two roads are paying taxes in Montana on a total valuation of less than $13,000,000, while tlie real value of the roads in tliis slate is more than $131,000,000. and yet some people wonder why it is necessary to levy special taxes to keep the children in school. Tlio ordinary fami tenant with personal property worth a cou ple of hundred dollars pays each year including road and poll tax about 10 per cent of the value of lfis prop erty in taxes, an amount greater in proportion than tlie sum at which the railroads are assessed. A large proportion of tho cost of maintaining the state and county government is due to railroad liti gation and the protection given to the railroads. The roads collect from tlie public in transportation charges sufficient to pay interest and dividends on a valuation of $55, 000 per mile, but when it comes to paying taxes the roads are only worth one-tenth of that sum. Under the present status of the laws of Montana it would do but lit tle good to raise the assessed value of the roads to the proper figure, for they would retaliate by raising the rates of transportation and the peo ple in the end would pay the tax. The only remedy is to have a state railroad commission with power not only to tlx the assessed valuation, but power also to fix all transporta tion charges. Of course tlie railroads might buy the members of the commission just as they have heretofore bought mem bers cf the legislature, but if the commission is elected by the people every two years the opportunity to sell would be limited and would never come twice to the same man. The chief objection heretofore raised against such a commission lias been the cost of maintaining it, hut the cost should be borne by the corpora tions which it is designed to control. WE 

THANK THEE! (By Rev. J. W. Falls.) One of tlie sweetest, most gracious and most acceptable expressions that ever falls from human lips is "1 thank you." . it is so full of cheer and good will, of courtesy and kindness, of grace and gratitude that we should never forget to think it, feel it, and ex press it. It is a debt we should instantly pay for every kind word spoken to us, i and for every service rendered. And if we want a June morning in our hearts when the fall is bleak, or the winter is dreary, say or do something which will call forth from another an heartfelt sincere "I thank you." When everything goes right, when business is good, when debts are paid, when notes are met and our larders are full, we are happy and feel thankful, but there is one al tar on which we often fail to burn tho sweet incense of thanks. For r.o matter what has come into our lives or happened to us since last November, enough of blessings of brightness and prosperity have fallen to our lot to mako us pro foundly thankful. The crops have been good; business first rate; and things have gone well witli us tem porarily; this whole year has been one all-embracing, gracious, favoring smile of God upon his children. And as we think of sun and rain, the fall ing seed and ripening grain, the glorified fruit of tree and vine, the gold and silver of the mines, may we hear the voice of the Hebrew poet saying, "All tilings come of thee." And with glad hearts, grateful hearts, sincere hearts, say; "We thank thee." One hundred and twenty-five years ago we were but an infant nation of a few milions, struggling for exist ence, on the edge of a vast domain of forests, prairies, hills and moun tains, lakes and rivers stretching away to the point where the Colum bia poured its golden tides into the Pacific. Today we number over 76, 000,000; the forest have fallen; the prairies have been subdued; splendid cities and towns dot the continent; the industrial pulse beats steady and true under the impulse of belts and pullies and thundering rolls and flam ing furnaces; .the voice of industry laughs on lake and river; prosperity floats from mountain's peak and ships masts; the commerce of the world is falling into our open hands. Dreams of 25 years ago have become living realities, so that there is danger of us becoming commercially intoxi cated. The voice of our nation is heard round tho world and respected. But the spirit of thanksgiving makes its way through this blaze of political glory and commercial splen dor and while we remember our il lustrious presidents and statesmen, and what they did to make the na tion what it is; while we remember thet heroes of '70, who gave to us national existence; the multitude in blue who, from '61 to '65 settled, once for all, the question of freedom and slavery: the heroes of Cuba and the Philippines, who killed and buried oppression, still that spirit of thanks giving makes its way to the top, and render its inspiration we build our national altar and put on it this in scription: "Thou hast made of us a great nation." And with gratitude for the past, with gladness for the present, and with hope for the fu ture of our land, we burn this in cense upon that altar, "Lord, we t.liank thee." J. W. 

FALLS. CHICAGO SCHOOLTEACHERS. A signal triumph has just been won by two Chicago schoolteachers over the most powerful corporations alf that city; and the more fully the de tails of the struggle become known, the more remarkable their victory apears. Tho appropriations for schools in Chicago have long been inadequate, and whenever the hoard of education needed $1,000,000 or $2,000.000 for any purpose, it has been in the habit of deducting it from tho teachers' salaries. A few years ago about 4000 of the 6000 teachers in Chicago or ganized a Teachers' Federation. Having reason to believe that the shortage of salary money was due to the fact that most of the large cor porations were evading their legal taxes, they appointed two young teachers, Miss Margaret Haley and Miss Catherine Goggin. a committee io investigate. Then, as the Boston Journal of Education says, "the bat tle royal began between two little schoolmarms and all the most power ful corporations and trusts in the state combined," and the school marms won. The women's inquiries revealed a most extraordinary state of things. Up to 1875, the railroads of Illinois had been assessed an annual tax on their franchises. In 1874 the assess ment was $31,000,000: in 18T5, only $22,000.000; and from 1875 to the present time, they have not bee$i assessed at all. In 1874, the fran chises of the two little liorsecar lines, which Chicago then had. were taxed at $1,000,000, but in 1899, the fran chises of the 700 miles of electric and cable car lines in Chicago were not taxed a cent. About 1875 the railroads, apparently, found out that it was cheaper to bribe the officials whose duty it was to apportion their taxes than it was to pay the tax. Other corporations found out the same thing. Of 23 large corporations that the teachers investigated, the majority were not assessed at all, and the others were assessed on only a small fraction of their actual prop erty. These 23 corporations includ ed the gas and coke company, the telephone company, an electric com pany, and 20 street railway companies. The women tried to Induce the of ficials, whose duty it was to tax these corporations, to tax them. Find ing that they were in league with the tax-dodgers and were determined not to comply with the law, the women engaged an able lawyer and took legal action to compel the officials to do their duty. The corporations fought hard; they exhausted every resource of evasion and delay; they appealed the case up from court to court; but the law was clear and the evidence of fraud overwhelming, and the supreme court of Illinois had ruled that they must pay.
