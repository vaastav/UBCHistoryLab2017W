"Boost, and THE WORLD Boosts With You—Knock, and You Knock Alone." THE FRANCHISE. If deeding away the city's streets for years for the use of a private cor poration is not worth considering then the citizens of Devils Lake would have just reason to question the power of the officials in whom they have placed hope for protection. Though the Pev ils Lake Street 'Railway orlina"Ce was likened in some ways to an ordinance in Grand Forks, yet the Gr.-'n-l Forks franchise w3? nor \i ai a single meeting of the city council. It w?s1 not grante! for several months after its proposal, even though the com pany was made up of and represented ,-ioav every business man in Gran' Forks. The matter of granting a r'r~.u cliise iVr the operation of a street rail \\n\ in Devils Lake is something thai should not he passed upon without thorough consideration. The apology is almost as anxious to plunge headlong into this with its eyes shut, as it was to have the municipal light plant delay-' ed. The municipal plant, however, was not secured without several months research ov.d careful eonsidera-: tioii in order that the people who had pinned faith in the officials and the rc.i oration were given fair play Just so. the street railway proposition should be given careful consideration ana the World congratulates the May or and members of the city council in uot taking any hurried steps in this n.atter. BUKKE AS A FINANCIER. Some of the insurgent, papers of the state have recently been telling what a great financier LaFollette is—and how his methods are alleged to have placed Wisconsin on the top wave of state-wide prosperity. Claims were made that while Governor LaFollette inaugurated methods by which the state was enriched—and at the same time the tax rate was reduced. All these claims about LaFollette may be true. The Forum has not investigated the situation. But it'seertis strange that the North Dakota insurgent and democratic press should, go. so far afield in search of the magnificent accomplishments of great governors—in the realms of fi nance. Why don't they dilate on the wonderful things done by Governor Burke during the three terms to which t"hey assisted in electing him the state's executive. Governor Sarles left the finances of the state in good shape. Ilis exper ience as a business man and a banker enabled him ito inaugurate methods, which got results. With another term to have, gotten his plans in perfect working order the state of North Dako ta would have been in excellent finan cial condition. The insurgent republicans three times assisted in the election of Gov ernor Burke. What are the results of his financial administrationf In order to make campaign dope for his third candidacy, Burke howled for economy—and advocated the reduc tion of the levy below a point where the state could pay its bills. Even his personal friends admitted the mistake —but Burke had to have a campaign issue. The results at present show the fol ly and incapacity of Burke. The gen eral fund of the state is practically empty. There are nearly $100,000 unpaid bills on the table. During his term as executive one state official was permitted to conduct his office in such a manner he now stands convicted of embezzlement. Another state official during Burke's incumbency—transacted the business of his office in such a manner that a judgment of several thousand dollars was secured against him for the illegal retention of fees. What a howl the insurgents and the democrats—and Burke—would have made had the latter two been stalwart republicans. Another expenditure of $65,000 was recklessly wasted in thhe prosecution of a district judge—to gain political advantage and personal revenge. The attitude, of Governor Burke on this matter is too well known to require comment. These are some of the things the state insurgc-nt and democratic papers might explain. "Why not discuss them instead of skipping away over Minnesota—clear into Wisconsin—for political dope? Why not enlighten the people of the state as to the juggling-during Burke's term—of different state fundsf—For um. Step by step the people of Devils Lake are nearing the goal. Another step was taken last evening toward the establishment of a municipal light plant and by a unanimous vote the council decided to advertise for bids for bonds to erect the building. Since the recent election in the city the need of a municipal light plant has become more and more apparent. People have -started figuring and the results of their figures, even after the election, has convinced raw who were even op pooedte the wish of the majority that tfce^munlieipal plant is the one thing that is most needed in Devils Lake. 

MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT Mr, Taft Champions tin Anti trust Statute. NEW REMEDIES SUGGESTED Not Repeal or Amendment, but Sup plemental Legislation Needed—The Tobaceo Trust Decision an Effective One—Federal Incorporation Recom mended and a Federal Corporation Commission Proposed—The Test of "Reasonableness." To tbe Senate and House of Repre sentatives: This message is tbe first of several which 1 shall send to congress during tbe interval between tbe opening of its regular session and Its adjourn ment for the Christmas holidays. The amount of information to be commu nicated as to the operations of tbe government, tbe number of important subjects calling for comment by the executive and tbe transmission to con gress of exhaustive reports of special commissions make It impossible to In clude in one message of a reasonable length a discussion of tbe topics that ougbt to be brought to the attention of the national legislature at its first regular session. The Anti-trust Law—Ths Supreme In May last the supreme court band ed down decisions in the suits in equi ty brought by tbe United States to en Join tbe further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri can Tobaceo trust and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch making and serve to advise the busi ness world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust act of 1890. Tbe decisions do not de part in any substantial way from tbe previous decisions of the court in con struing and applying this important statute, but they clarify those deci sions by further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal con struction of the act. By the decrees they furnish a nseful precedent as to the proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and to pre serve the benefit, freedom and spur of reasonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. No Change In the Rule of Decision, Merely In Its Form of Expression. The statute in its first section de Clares to be illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations" and in tbe. second declares guilty of a misdemeanor "every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of tbe trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nations." In two early cases, where the atatnte wae Invoked to enjoin a transporta tion rate agreement between inter state railroad Companies, It was held that it was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonable at common law, be cause It was ssid that the statute was directed against all contracts and com binations In restraint of trade, whether reasonable at common law or not. It was plain from the record, however, that the contracts complained of In those cases would not have been deem ed reasonable at common law. In sub sequent cases the court said that tbe statute should be given a reasonable construction and refused to include within Its Inhibition certain contrac tual restraints of trade which It de nominated as Incidental or as Indirect. These cases of restrant of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were Instances which at common law would have been call ed reasonable. In the Standard Oil and tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the testa of the com mon law and in defining exceptions to the literal application of the statute only substituted for tbe test of being Incidental or indirect that of being reasonable, and this without varying In tbe slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute. In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way If the court had originally accepted in its construction the rule at common law. It has been said that the court by in troducing Into tbe construction of tbe statute common law distinctions has emasculated It. This is obviously un true. By its judgment every contract and combination in restraint of inter state trade made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition or of establish lng In whole or in part a monopoly of such trade is condemned by the stat ute. The most extreme critics cannot Instance a case that ought to be con demned under the statute which Is not brought within its terms as thus con strued. The suggestion is also made that the supreme court by its decision in tht last two cases has committed to tb« court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case restraint of trade is within the term The Devils Lake Improvement com pany has always occupied more or less of Farrington avenue next to its build ing. Xow it has more. oo The fact that marked copies of the Journal have been sent to the various bonding companies to lessen the stand ard of Devils Lake, although it may cause some delay, will not cause any great hardship for there are enough bonding companies in the universe to have faith in this city, while all are anxious to find out if there is any rea- /"Wr ir* of tbe statute. This Is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at com mon law Is well understood and is clearly defined. It does not rest In tbe discretion of tbe court. It must be limited to accomplish tbe purpose of a lawful main contract to which in order that it shall be enforceable at all it must be incidental. If it exceed the needs of that contcact it Is void. The test of reasonableness was never applied by tbe court at com man law to contracts or combinations or con spiracies in restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose necessary effect would be to stifle competition, to con trol prices or establish monopolies. The courts never assumed power to I say tbat such contracts or comblna tlons or conspiracies might be lawful If the parties to tbem were only mod erate in the use of the power thus se cured and did not exact from the pub I lie too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that many theorists and others engaged in business violating tbe stat ute have hoped tbat some such line could be drawn by courts, but no court of authority has ever attempted It Certainly there Is nothing In the deci sions of tbe latest two cases from which snch a dangerous theory of Ju fiicial discretion in enforcing this stat ute can derive tbe slightest sanction. Fere* and Effectiveness of 8tatute a Matter of Growth. We have been twenty-one years mak- 1 Court Decisions. lng this statute effective for the pur poses for wbich It was enacted. The Knight case was discouraging and aeemed to remit to tbe states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of tbe trusts. Slowly, bowev er. the error of tbat judgment was cor rected, and only In the last three or four years has tbe heavy hand of tbe law been laid upon tbe great illegal combinations tbat have exercised such an absolute dominion over many of our Industries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pend lng. but juries have felt averse to con victing for jail sentences and judges have been most reluctant to impose such sentences on men of respectable standing in society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory I Still, as tbe offense becomes better un derstood and tbe committing of it par takes more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law we can be confl dent tbat juries will convict individu als and that jail sentences will be im posed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution. In tbe Standard Oil case tbe supreme and circuit courts found the combina tion to be a monopoly of tbe interstate business of refining, transporting and marketing petroleum and its products. effected and maintained through thlr ty-seven different corporations, the stock of which was held by a New Jer sey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, di rected the transfer and pro rata distri button by the New Jersey company of tbe stock held by it in tbe thirty-seven corporations to and among its stock holders, and the corporations and lndi vldual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to restore such monopoly, and all agreements be tween the subsidiary corporations tend ing to produce or bring about further violations of the act were enjoined. In tbe tobacco case tbe court found that the Individual defendants, twen ty-nine in number, had been engaged in a successful effort to acquire com plete dominion over tbe manufacture, sale and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad and that this had been done by combinations made with a purpose and effect to stifle competi tion, control prices and establish a monopoly, not only In the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin foil and lic orice used. in its manufacture and ef its products of cigars, cigarette* and snuffs. Tbe tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate the will of the court and end the violation of the stat ute. There was here no single hold ing company, as In the case of tbe Standard Oil trust. The main company was the American Tobacco company. a manufacturing, selling and holding company. Tbe plan adopted to de stroy tbe combination and restore com I petition involved the redlvislon of the capital and plants of tbe whole trust between some of the" companies con stitutlng the trust and new companiei organized for tbe purposes of the de cree and made parties to it and nam boring, new and old. fourteen. Situation After Readjustment. The American Tobacco compan.v I (old), readjusted capital $92,000,000 the Liggett & Meyers Tobacco company (new), capital $67,000,000 the P. Loril lard company (new), capital $47,000, 000, and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco company (old), capital $7,525,000, are chiefly engaged in the manufacture and sale of chewing and smoking to bacco and cigars. The former one tin foil company Is divided into two, one of $825,000 capital and the other of $400,000. Tbe one snuff company Is divided into three companies, one wltb a capital of $15,000,000. another with a capital of $8,000,000 and a third wltb a capital of $8,000,000. Tbe licorice companies are two, one with a capital of $5,758,300 and another with a capi tal of $2,000,000. There Is also the British-American Tobacco company, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $26,000,000, the Porto Rk-an Tobacco company, with a capital of $1,800,000. and the corporation of United Cigar Stores, with a capital of S9.000.000. Under this arrangement each of the different kinds of business will be dls tributed between two or more eompa nies with division of the prominent brands In the same tobacco products, so as to make competition not only possible, but necessary. Thus the smoking tobacco business of the coun try Is divided so tbat tbe present In son for the claims of the apology— nevertheless, they can read between the lines of the convict's appeal. -oo- The Devils Lake World issued a nice edition in celebrating the Lake Region banquet.—Fargo Forum. oo A night school for farmers which has been launched at Grafton will do away with the old adage "Make hay while the sun shines." The idea that farm ing was one vocation that did not re quire night work is now entirely dis- dependent compaalsa have ilJt per cent, while tbe American Tobacco com pany will hare 3S.08 per cent, the Lig gett A Meyen 20.05 per cent, the Loril lard company 22.82 per cent and the Beynolda company 2.08 per cent. Tbe stock of the other thirteen companies,, both preferred aud common, baa been taken from the" defendant American Tobacco company and bas been dis tributed among Its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given voting power which was denied it under the old organisation. Tbe ratio of the pre ferred stock to the common was as 78 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change In tbe character of the owner ship and control of each company. In the original suit there were twen ty-nine defendants, who were charged with being the conspirators through whom tbe illegal combination acquired and exercised its unlawful dominion. Under the' decree these defendants will hold amounts of stock in tbe varlons distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent as a maximum to 28% per cent as a minimum, except In the case of one small company, the Porto Mean Tobacco company, in which they will hold 45 per cent. The twenty-nine in dividual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock ex cept from each other, and the group Is thus prevented from extending its con trol during that period. All parties to tbe suit and the new companies who are made parties are enjoined perpet ually from in any way effecting any combination between any of the com panies In violation of the statute by way' of resumption of the old trust Each of the fourteen companies Is en joined from acquiring stock in any of the others. All these companies are enjoined from having common direc tors or officers, or common buying or selling agents, or common ofllces, or lending money to each other. Size ef New Companies. Objection was made by certain in dependent tobacco companies tbat this settlement was unjust because It left companies with very large capital in active business and that the settle ment that would be effective to put all on an equality would be a division ot the capita] and plant of the trust into small fractions in amount more near ly equal to tbat of each of tbe lnde pendent, companies. This contention results from a misunderstanding of the anti-trust law and its purpose. It is not intended thereby to prevent the accumulation of 4ft«ge capital In busi ness enterprises in 4rhich such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. is directed against such an aggrega tion of capital only when Its purpose is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and establish lng a monopoly. If we shall have by the decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capital and plant have been divided we shall have accomplished the useful purpose of the statute. Confiscation Not th* Purpose of the 8tatut«. It is not the purpose of the statute to confiscate the property and capital of tbe offending trusts. Methods of punishment by fine or imprisonment of the individual offenders, by fine of the corporation or by forfeiture of Its goods In transportation are provided, but the proceeding in equity Is a spe clflc remedy to stop the operation of the trust by injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital In violation of tbe statute Effectiveness of Decree. I venture to say that not In tbe his tory of American law has a decree more effective for snch a purpose been entered by a court than that against the tobacco trust Aa Circuit Judge Noyes said In his Judgment approving the decree: "The extent to which it has been necessary to tear apart this combina tion and force it Into new forms with the attendant burdens ought to demon strate tbat the federal antl-trnst statute Is a drastic statute which accomplishes effective results, which so long aa it stands on the statute books must be obeyed and which cannot be disobey ed without incurring farreachlng pen sides. And, on the other hand, the successful reconstruction of this or ganizatlon should teach that the effect of enforcing this statnte is not to de •troy, but to reconstruct not to de mollsb, but to recreate in accordance wltb the conditions which the congress has declared shall exist among the people of the United States." Common 8took Ownership, It has been assumed that the pree Hit pro- rata and common ownership ir I all these companies by former stock holders of the trust would Insure a I continuance of the same old single con trol of all tbe companies into which tbe trust has by decree been dlsinte grated. This Is erroneous and la based upon the assumed Inefflcacy and lnnoc I aousness of judicial injunctions. Tbi companies are enjoined from co-opera Hon or combination they have differ ent managers, directors, purchasing and sales agents. If all or many of the numerous stockholders, reaching into tbe thousands, attempt to secure concerted action of tbe companies with view to the control of the market their number Is so large tbat such an 1 attempt could not well be concealed. ind Its prime movers and all Its partlc- Ipants would be at once subject to con tempt proceedings and Imprisonment of a summary character. Tbe immedi ate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all tbe com panies under different managers, and then competition must follow or there will be activity by one company and stagnation by another. Only a abort time will inevitably lead to a change pensed with, now that the new school I isin operation. The only drawback is that the chores may not be perform ed until a little later the next morn jing- I 00 The knowledge that Devils Lake merchants treat the ont of town cus tomers as good as those who live in the city and that everythng possible is done to make them feel at home when they are ncie, is advertising the eity more than any other business venture. Since the World has entered the news- C-. ./ w-* J.\ Uy* in ownership of.the stock, aa all op port unity for continued co-operation must disappear. Tboee critics who •peak of this disintegration in the trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to tbe inevitable working of the decree and understand little the personal danger of attempt ing to evade or set at naught tbe sol emn Injunction of a court whose, object la made plain by the decree and whose Inhibitions are set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness unexampled in the history of equity jurisprudence. Voluntary Reorganizations of Other Trusts at Hand. The effect of these two decisions* bas led to decrees dissolving tbe combina tion of manufacturers of electric lamps, a southern wholesale grocers' association, an interlocutory decree against tbe powder trust, with direc tions by tbe circuit court compelling dissolution, and other combinations of a similar history are now negotiating with the department of Justice looking to a disintegration by decree and re organization in accordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these reorganizations without general busi ness disturbance. Movement For Repeal of the Anti trust Law. But now that tbe anti-trust act is aeen to be effective for the accomplish ment of tbe purpose of its enactment we are met by a cry from many differ ent quarters for Its repeal. It is said to be obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old fash ioned methods of destructive competi tion between small units and to make Impossible those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of tbe cost of production that are essential to con tinued prosperity and normal growth. In the recent decisions tbe supreme court makes clear that there is noth ing in the statute wbich condemns combinations*of capital or mere big ness of plant organized to secure econ omy if production and a reduction of its cost It is only when the purpose or necessary effect of the organization and maintenance of the combination or tbe aggregation of Immense size are the stifling of competition, actual and potential, and the enhancing of prices and establishing a monopoly tbat tbe statute Is violated. Mere size is no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plants necessari ly eliminates competition between the units thus combined, but this elimina tion Is in contravention of tbe statute Only when tbe combination is made for purpose of ending this particular com petition in order to secure control of and enhance prices and create a mo nopoly. Lack of Definiteness In the 8tatute. Tbe complaint is made of the stat. ute that It is not sufficiently definite In its description of that which is for bidden to enable business men to avoid Its violation. The suggestion is that we may have a combination of two corporations which may run on for years and that subsequently tbe at torney general may conclude tbat It was a violation of tbe statute and that which was supposed by the combiners to be innocent then turns out to be a combination In violation of the statute The answer to this hypothetical case la that when men attempt to amass such stupendous capital as will enable them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monopoly tbey know the purpose of their acta. Men do not do such a thing without having it clearly In mind. If what they do Is merely for the pnrpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of suppressing competition by use of tbe bigness of the plant they are creating, then tbey cannot be convicted at the time the union is made, nor can they be convicted later unless it happen that later on they conclude to sup press competition and take tbe usual methods for doing ao and thns estab lish for themselves a monopoly. They can in auch a case hardly complain If the motive which subsequently la dis closed Is attributed by the court to the original combination. New Remedisa Suggested. Much Is said of tbe repeal of this atatute and of constructive Iegialatlon Intended to accompllah tbe purpose and blaze a clear path for honeat mer chants and business men to follow. It may be that auch a plan will be evolved, but I submit that the discus sions which have been brought out in recent daya by the fear of tbe con tinued execution of tbe antl-truat law have produced nothing but glittering generalities and bare offered no line of distinction or rule of action as defi nlte and aa clear aa that which the su preme court Itself lays down In en forcing tbe statute. Supplemental Legislation Needed, Not Repeal or Amendment. I see no objection, and Indeed 1 can aee decided advantagea, in the enact ment of a law which shall describe and denounce methods of competition which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpoae denounced In the anti-trust law. Tbe attempt and pur pose to suppress a competitor by un derselling him at a price so unprofita ble aa to drive him out of business or tbe making of exclusive contracts wltb customers under which they are re quired to give up association wltb oth er manufacturers and numeroua kin dred methods for stifling competition and effecting monopoly should be de scribed, with sufficient accuracy in a criminal statute on the one hand tc enable the government to shorten Its task by prosecuting single misdemean ors Instead of an entire conspiracy and on the other bnnd to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business community what must be avotded. Federal Incorporation Recommended. In a special message to congress oi Tan. 7, 1910. I ventured to point on paper field and tells these out of town people of the bargains that are here, there ie a steady increase of this out of town patronage. Christmas time is an especially good time to let these people know that their trade is appre ciated and the merchants are doing all in their power. oo The World has never heard of any opposition to the proposed street rail way franchise, so far as the city coun cil is concerned, but that does not mean that that body should neglect to tbe disturbance to business that would probably attend the dissolution of these offending trusts.1 said: "But roch an Investigation and pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects tbe comfort not only of stockholders, but of millions of wage earners, employees ind associated tradesmen, must neces sarily tend to disturb tbe confidence of tbe business commnnlty. to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from Its places of hoarding and pro duce a halt In otir present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstances among the innocent many for the faults of the guilty few. The question which I wish in this message to bring clearly to the con sideration and discussion of congress is whether, in order -to avoid such a possible business danger, something cannot be done by which these busi ness combinations may be offered means, without great financial dis turbance, of changing tbe character, organization and extent of their busi ness Into one within tbe lines of the law "tinder federal control and super vision. securing compliance with the anti-trust statute. "Generally in the industrial combina tions called 'trusts' the principal busi ness is the sale of goods in many statct and in foreign markets—In other words, the Interstate and foreign business far exceeds tbe business done In nny one state. This fact will justify the fed eral government in granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell In Interstate and foreign com merce tbe products of useful manufac ture under such limitations as will se cure a compliance wltb the anti-trust law. It Is possible so to frame a stat nte tbat, whiJe It offers protection to a federal company against harmful, vex atious and unnecessary invasion by the atates. it shall subject it to reasona ble taxation and control by the states with respect to its puiely local busi ness. I renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of cor porations to engage In trade and com merce among the states and with for eign nations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law and every explanation which was at that time offered to posalble objections has been confirmed by our experience since tbe enforcement of the anti-truat atat nte haa resulted in the actual dlasolu tlon of active commercial organlsa tlona. It is even more manifest now than It was then that the denunciation of conspiracies In restraint of trade abould not and does not mean the de nial of organizations large enough to be intrusted with our Interstate and foreign trade. It baa been made more clear now than it waa then tbat a purely negative atatute like tbe anti trust law may well be aupplemented by apedfic provisions for tbe building up and regulation of legitimate na tional and foreign commerce. Government Administrative Experts Needed to Aid Courts In Truet Dissolutions. The drafting of the decrees in the dissolution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganisation into le gitimate corporations, bas made It es pecially apparent tbat the courts are not provided wltb the administrative machinery to make the necessary In quiries preparatory to reorganisation or to puraue auch inquiries, and they should be empowered to' Invoke the aid of the bureau of corporations in determining the suitable reorganiza tion of the disintegrated parts. The circuit court and the attorney general were greatly aided in framing tbe de cree in the tobacco trust dissolution by an expert from tbe bureau of corpora tiona. Federal Corporation Commission Pro posed. I do not set forth in detail the terms and aectlona of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation per mitting and aiding .the formation of combinations of capital into federal corporations. Tbey ahould be subject to rigid rules as to their organisation and procedure. Including effective pub licity, and to tbe closest supervision as to tbe issue of stock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission In tbe department of commerce and labor,,to which in times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understood that incorporation under a federal law could not exempt tbe com pany thus formed and its Incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust law for subsequent i! legal conduct, but the publicity of its procedure and the opportunity for fre quent consultation with the bqreau or commission In charge of the incorpora tion as to the legitimate purpose of Its transactions would offer It as great st curity against successful prosecution' peruse carefully the twenty typewrit ten pages of an ordinance. What would the people think—what would the Stotlars think, had the city council passed upon it after just bearing it read? -oo- That the Journal and Inter Ocean have always been consolidated and are considered as one, is evidently the opin ion of Joseph M. Kelly, one of the stockholders in both institutions, since one of the pigeon holes in the vault of tbe building formerly used by lb, for violations of the law aa wonlC b* practical or wise. Such a bureau or commlsalon mlgbt: veil be Invested also wltb the duty S already referred to of aiding courts-^ In tbe dissolution and. recreation ot:: trusts within tbe law. It abould be an executive tribunal of tbe dignity and. power of the comptroller of the cur rency or tbe Interstate commerce com mission, wbich now exercises supervis ory power over Important classes of corporations under federal regulation. The drafting of such a federal in corporation law would offer ample op* portunlty to prevent many manifest evils In corporate management today, including Irresponsibility of control la the hands of tbe few who are not the leal owners. Incorporation Voluntary. I recommend tbat tbe federal char ters thus to be granted shall be volun~ tary, at lea8t until experience Justifies mandatory provisions. Tbe benefit to be derived from tbe operation of gnat businesses under tbe protection of sucb a charter would attract all who are anxious to keep within the lines of tb» law. Other large comblnationa that fall to take advantage of tbe federal Incorporation will not have a right to complaln if their failure Is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transac tions to the careful official scrutiny, competent supervision and publicity attendant upon tbe enjoyment of sucb a charter. Only Supplemental Leglelation Needed- Tbe opportunity thus suggested for federal Incorporation, it seems to met. is suitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate tbe aquarlng of great industrial enterprises to tbe rulo of action laid down by tbe anti-trust law. This statute aa construed 1 «*poratlons organized under this act should be prohibited from acquir ing and holding stock in other corpo rations (except- for special reasons, upon approval by tbe proper federal authority), thus avoiding tbe creation under national auspices of the holding company wltb subordinate corporations in different states, wbich has been sucb an effective agency in the crea tion of tbe great trusts and monopo lies. "If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations in restraint of trade is to be effectively enforced it is essential that the national govern ment shall provide for the creation of national corporations to carry on a. le gitimate business throughout tbe Unit ed States. The conflicting laws of tbe different states of the Union with re spect to foreign corporations make it difficult if not impossible, for one cor poration to comply with their require menta so as to carry on business In a number of different atates." supreme court must contlnp' line of distinction to* -ness. It mu»' .legitimate bust are to en*orced unless we I oanish individualism from all I business and reduce it to one common system of regulation or control of prices like tbat which now prevail* with respect to public ^utilities and which when applied to all business would be a long step toward atate so cialism. Importance of the Antl-trust Aot. Tbe anti-trust act Is the expression^ of tbe effort of a freedom loving peo ple to preserve equality of opportunity^ It Is the result of the confident deter mination of sucb a people to maintain their future growth by preserving un controlled and unrestricted the enter-' prise of the Individual, his Industry, his Ingenuity, bis Intelligence and bl» Independent courage. For twenty years or more this stat ute bas been upon tbe statute book. All knew its general purpose and ap proved. Many of Its violators were cynical over Its assumed impotence It seemed Impossible of enforcements Slowly the mills of the courts ground, and only gradually did tbe majesty or the law assert Itself. Many of Its statesmen-authors died before It be came a living force, and they and oth ers saw tbe evil grow which ttiey bad hoped to destroy. Now Ita efficacy la seen now Its power Is heavy now Its. object Is near achievement Now we bear the call for Its repeal on the plea that It interferes with business pros perity, and we are advised in most general terma' how by some' other stat ute and In some other way the evil, we are just stsmplng out can be cured If we only abandon this work of twen ty years and try another experiment for another term of years.
