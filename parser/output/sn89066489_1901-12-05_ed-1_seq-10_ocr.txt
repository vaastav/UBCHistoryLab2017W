His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness ot nature. ' the sweetness and fntloncss of character which so endeared htm to his clove asso ciates. To a stt u'ard uf Kitty liuegri:) In public life he united the under affec tions and home virtues which are nil Important in the makeup of nutlonal character. A gallant soldier in the great war for the union, ho also shnne as nn example to all our people because of his conduct In the most sacred un.l Intimate of horn relations. There could be no personal hatred of him, for he never act ed with aught but consideration for the welfare of others. No one could tail to respect him who knew him In public or Srlvete life. The defenders of those mnr ereus criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that It Is exer cised (or political ends Inveigh iiR.ttnst wealth and Irresponsible power. Hut for this assassination even this Inue upology cannot be urged." "The shock, ths grief of the country, are bitter In the minds of ull who fa -li" dark days while the president yet hover .1 between Ufa and death. At lust the i;-ht waa stilled In the kindlv eves, ami the breath went from the lips that even In i ..i - , ... . j i f forgiveness te his murderer, of love for Ola menus ana oi uniauering irusi in me will ef the Most High. Such u de.nli crowning the glory of such a life leaves us with Infinite sorrow, but with such Srlde In what he had accomplished and m Is own personal character that we .eel ths blow not as struck at him. hut as struck at the nation. We mourn a pood and great president who Is dead, bui while we mourn we are lifted up lv tin splendid achievements of his life and lh grand heroism with which he met hi death." In ths earn connection he maker strong rocoramendatlona as to how the nation should deal with anurchy. lie urges that the preaching or teaching of anarchy be net permitted, and requests oengress to enact legislation that will revent anarchists from foreign countries andltig upon our shores. He would also have the federal courts given jurisdiction over any man who kills, or attempts to kill, the. president of the country, or any person who is In line for succession to the presidency. He has no fer, however, that the country will ever full Into an archy. "The federal courts should be given Jur isdiction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the president or any man who by the -jonstttution or by law Is in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our in stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole human race, and all mnnklnd should band against the anarchlst,.Ul3u:lma-ahuuid b made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known us the slave trade, for It Is of far blacker Infamy than cither. It should be so declared liv treaties among ill civilized powers. Such treaties wotiid give to the federal government the power of dealing with the crime." The Trtiats. The president sees cause for congratu lation for the nation m the business condi tions of the present, but sets lu the-"tremendous and highly comp.ix industrial development which went ui nith ever ac celerated rapidity- auring ihe latter half of the nineteenth century" a serious social problem for the promt and future. He does not believe that the old laws and old sustoms are sufficient to regulate the ac cumulation and distribution ot wealth of the present time. He does not attribute the creation of great corporate fortunes to th existence of a protective tariff, "nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causea In the business world, op erating In other countries as they operate In our own." In this connection he says: 'The process has aroused muuh antago nism, a great part of which Is wholly without warrant. H Is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have frown poorer. On the contrary, never be ore has the average man, the wage worker, the tarmer, the small trader, been so well off as In this country and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth, yet It remains true that a for tune accumulated in legitimate business) can be accumulated by the person spe cially benefited only on condition of con ferring Immense Incidental benefits upon others. Successful enterprise of ths type which benefits all mankind pan nnlv 1st If the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success " But while he realizes existing condls tlsna. he emphasizes the fact that congress In providing remedies must act with cau tion, as the men and corporations "who have built up our commerce and driven our railroads across the continent have done great good to our people, and without Uiem the material development of which we are so Justly proud could never have taken place. Moreover, we should recog nise the Immense Importance to this ma terial development ef leaving as unham pered as ft compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon Whom the success of business nnaratlnna Inevitably rests. The slightest study ot business conditions will satisfy anyone capable ef forming a Judgment that the personal equation is the most Important (actor in a business .Deration- th.i tha business ability of the man at the head of any Business concern, Dig or little, is usual ly the factor which fixes the gulf between striking success ana nopeiess failure." Another reason for caution In trust lee-la. latlon which he gives "Is to be found In tha International commercial conditions of to day. The same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and Individual wealth have mass tnesn very potent factors in inter national commercial comoetltlon. Busi ness concerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturally those which take ths lead In the strife for com mercial supremacy among the nations of ins worm. America nas oniy just begun to assume that commanding position In us international nusiness wona wnicn we believe will more and more be hers. It Is ef the utmost Importance) that this po sition be not Jeoparded, especially at time when the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the skill, busl- a ess energy and mechanical aptitude of our people make, foreign markets essen tial, under such conditions It would be meet trawise to cramp or to fetter the antzttul atraneth of our nation. "Moreover, It cannot too often bo pointed esst that to strike with ignorant tlotaaca MtholBtoresss of mo tot ef nien as isst ON 

IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. Inevitably endangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule In our national life, therule which underlies all others, is that on the whole and In the long run we shall go up or down together. There are excep tions, and In times of prosperity some will prosper far more and In times of adversi ty some will suffer far more than others: but, speaking generally, a period of good times means that all share more or less In them, and in a period of hard times ail feel the stress to a greater or less degree. He points to the fact that In the past "the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally oppos ing In dealing with business Interests for the government to undertake by crude and ill-considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far-reaching na tional disaster that It would be prefer able to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and :n what manner It Is prac ticable to apply remedies." Remedies for the Trust Evil. But while he says the above Is true, he yet sees many evils for which there should be remedies provided. Of these evils the chid is over capitalization, "because of its many baleful consequences." He says: "The conviction of the American people that the great corporations, known as trusts, are In certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare, is based upon sincere conviction that com bination and concentration should be not prohibited, but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled, ana in my "'L,m-"' "..mrl.o l..n I" rlphl As a remedy for these evils he says: l ne nrst essential in determining now lo deal with the great Industrial com Mnutions Is knowledge of the facts publicity. In tha Interest! of the public the government should have the right to Inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged In Inter state business. Publicity Is the only sure remedy which we can now Invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and in the course of administration. The first requisite Is knowledge, full and complete knowledge which may be made public to the world. "Artificial bodies, such as corporations and Joint stock or other associations de pending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision, and full and accurate Information as to their operations should be made public regu larly at reasonable Intervals. "The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized In one state, always do business In many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There Is utter lack of uniformity In the state laws about them, and as no state haa any exclusive Interest In or power over tneir acts it nas in practice proved Im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore In the Interest of the whole people the nation should, without Interfering with the pow er ef the states In the matter Itself, also assumeBQWerQf -Supervision and regula tlon over all corporations doing an Inter state business. This Is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of Its wealth from the existence of some ffinnnpnli.tii. .Ian I ..!... .). n ffg- business. There would be no hardship In sucn supervision, uanas are suDjecc 10 It. and In their case It la now aceantad as a simple matter of course. Indeed It Is probable that supervision of corpora tions by the national government need not go so far as Is now tha case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Massachusetts la order to produce excellent results." Tne president believes that It will bo possible to secure the needed remedies tor tne trust evu under tno constitution as It now exists, but if conrreu thlnlra otherwise he recommends that a constitu tional amendment be subm tted that will CO' f er the povc necessary. in connection with the trusts he rec ommends legislation creating a cabinet of ficer, to b known os secietary of :orn ne.ce whniie di ties would be to deal wnn nu qu suons concern g commeroe, lebrr and th merchant manne. Would Exclade the Chinese. The message Vomalns a strnnr ranatn. rtiendatlon for t! e reenactment at anno of the present Chinese exclusion act, in which connection he says: - wages are nigner to-day in the United States than ever before In our hlilnn and far higher than In anv other mhh. iry. ine sianaara or living is also higher than ever before. Every effort of legis lator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency ot this conltlan ot things and its improvement wherever possiDie. not onir must our lahne h protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected so far as It la possible from the presence In this country of any la- ourers urougm over Dy contract or of those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men In the labor market and draa them to a Inarav iwi I regard It as necessary, with this end In view, to reenact Immediately ths law excluding Chinese laborers and to strengthen It wherever necessary In or der to make Its enforcement entirely ef- He also recommends such legislation by an amendment to the Interstate commerce law, as will protect the labor of one state from competing with the prison labor of another state, and also that the govern ment cease being a party to this competi tion by not purchasing goods made either by convict labor or that in which women and children are caused to work excessive hours or at night. - In the labor unions of the present he sees much that Is good. In which connection he says: "Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations er unions of wageworkers when managed with forethought and when they combine in sistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rlghta of others The display of these qualities In such bodies Is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves. Finally there must also In many cases bo action by the government In order to safeguard the rights and Interests of all Under our constitution there Is much more scope for such action by tha stata and the municipality than by the nation But on points such as those touched on above the national government can act "When all Is said and done, the rule of brotherhood remains as the Indispensable prerequisite to success In the kind of na tional life for which we strive. Each man must work for himself, and unless ho so works no outside help csn avail him. But each man must -remember also that he Is Indeed his brother's keeper, and that while no man who refuses to walk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else, yet that each at times stumbles or halt, that eeea at !:m-s reds to have the h.'V'rr'Pftv on? atr'ichrd to him.

The lassalgratlea Laws. He pronounces our present Immigration laws unsatisfactory. In which connect:on he says "we need every honest and ci t.clent Immigrant fitted to beoine an American citKen. every Immigrant who . comes here to stay, who brings hire a strong body, a good head and resolute purpose to e bis duty well in every siv and to bring up ail children as law-abidir.g, Goct-ttar'ng members of the community." Hut he says: 'There should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of werkliu a threefold Improvement over our present ayrlem First, we should aim to excluJe atsolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in anarchistic pr n ciples or members of an&rch sti- socie ties, but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory repu tation. This means that we should re quire a more thorough system of luspec t'rn abroad and a more rlg'd system of exam.nMion at our Immlzrjtlon ports. h fo.mer being especially nec"..ary. "The second object of a proper Immi gration law ought to be to ie."ire by a careful and not merely perfunctory edu cational test some Intelligent capacity to appreciate American institutions and act sanely as American citlnns. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them belong to the Intelligent criminal class, but It would do what Is also In point that Is, tend to decrease the sum of Ig norance so potent In producing Ihe envy, suspicion, malignant passion and hatred of order out of whlrh ansrchlvtlc sentl- ment Inevitably springs.

The Tariff. The president does not desire any change In the present tariff schedule rc-nt u liMft such may l made in reciprocity treaties, and recommends the adoption of reciproc ity treaties and the general policy of reci procity as a means of opening the doors of iore:gn nations to our commerce. In which count ct ion he says: "Kvt ry application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national nenis n.usi be conditioned upon the cardinal laet that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being uf the waitewirker is a prime consid eration of our entire policy of economic legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle of reci procity must command our hearty sup port. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgensy of the need for wider markets and for a lib eral policy In dealing with foreign na tions. Whatever is merely petty and vex atious In the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customeis to whom we dispose of our surplus products In the long run directly or Indirectly pur chase those surplus products by giving us sometning in return, rneir anility to put abase oui uioduili should us fai as pus slble be secured by so urranglng our tar iff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own Industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. "The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be In connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we a, re beyond the reach of successful competition. "I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid l. fore It by my predecessor." The Merchant Marine. The president pronounces our merchant marine "discreditable to us as a nation and liislgnlllcsnt to that of other nations which we overtop In other forms of business,' and says we "shnuU' not longer submit to conditions under v.l;u h ui.ly a trifling por tion of our great commerce is carried In our own ships. Of ili.s he says: "To remedy thle statu of things would not merelv serve to bullU up our shipping In terests, but It woulil :!mi result In benefit to all who are !rtnted In the perma nent establishment . .i n wider market for American products aril would provide an auxiliary force for the rav...

Goods. It should b made advantageous to carry American 'loan bum t-nlps His recommeiictHtlon on this subject is only that "our government should take such action as will remedy these Inequali ties. The American merchant marine should be restored lo the' ocean." Finances. Under this heading (he president recom mends such ligieluiii.n as will better safe guard against the ,k:viiging influences of commercial crises and financial panics and such as will make ibe currency of the country mire responsive to the demands of domestic trade and commerce. He points out the Ir.ct that the receipts from duties r. import ar,i interna! taxes exceed the exvx i.i tin i s of the govern ment, but counsels ai.vr.st reducing ths revonus so that thtre be the possl bUlty of a deficit. VBu: after providing hgair.st any such contingency .mans should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs." He urges the necessity for strict economy In expenditures, but that "our national needs rorrjia us to De niggardly in tne mat ter of providing whatever Is actually neC' essary to our well-being." later-Mate Commeroe. Ho points to defects In the Interstate commerce law, and recommends amend ments to correct them. In which connection he says: "Those who complain of the management of the railways allege that established rates are not maintained, that re bates and similar devices are habitually resorted to, that these 'preferences are usually In favor of the large shipper, that they drive out of business the smaller competitor, that while many rates are too low many others ars excessive ana mat gross preferences are made affecting both localities and commodities. Upon the oth er hand, the railways assert that the law by Its very terms tenas to -proauce many of these Illegal practices by depriving car riers of that right ot concerted action which they claim Is necessary to estab lish and maintain nondiscriminating rates. -Tha act should be amended. The rail way Is a public servant. Its rates should bo Just to and open to all shippers alike. The government should see to It that iihin its lurladlction this Is so and should provide a speedy. Inexpensive and fFMtlve ramadv to that end. At the same time It must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries tnrougn wnico the commercial Ufeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than h. anaoiment at ledslatlon which would unnecessarily interfere with the develop ment ana operation oi mesa commercial agencies." Asriiaaltaral lateresta. The president cites the forest legislation of the past and the great good of forest preserves to the people, and says they wlU Inevitably bo of still greater value. Con tinulag. he sags : 4 a raut tha protection of the forest reserves rests with the general land office, the mapping and description of their tim ber with the United States geological sur vey and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the bureau of for estry, which Is also charged with the gen eral advancement 'of practical forestry in the United itatea. These various func tions should be united la the bursa of feroatry, lo which taey preperly belorg. The present diffusion of responsibility Is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective cooperation between the government and the men who utilise the resources of the nserrao, wttheut whleh - the tolereets of both tShM luseVr. lata scientific bureaus generally should bejp0' urder the department of agriculture. The presi.:r.r should nave oy law ine poei of transferring lands for use as forest re serves to the department ef agriculture. He alreadv has "such'Sower In the case of lands needed by the departments of war and ihe navy." Irrigation. Irrigation la connection with the waste lands of the west is a Question to which the president gives considerable attention, and makes strong recommendations tat government assistance In reclaiming taq waste lands by assisting in theft irriga tion and the control of water rights wher ever that is possible, and of this he says: "In the arid region It Is water, not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that ot our whole country to-day U the waters that now run to waste were saved and used lor irriga tion. The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States. "In cases where natural conditions have , been restored for a few years vegetation has again carpeted the ground, birds and i deer are coming back, and hundreds of i persons, especially from the immediate I neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege ot camping. Borne at least of the forest reserves should afford per petual protection to the native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of ihe larger kinds and free camping grounds for the ever-Increasing numbers of men snd wom en who have learned lo find rest, health and recreation In the splendid forests and flower-clad meadows of our mountains. The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of our peo ple as a whole and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few." "The forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storsge works are nec essary to equalise the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construc tion has been conclusively shown to be an uuuei laHlliK lua 'III lur privam cioiri, I Nor ran It be best accomplished by the In dividual states acting alone, t ar-reacning Interstate nrublems are Involved, and the resources of single states would often be Uiaoequaite. It Is properly a national function, at least In aome of Its features. It is as riant for tha national government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works fur water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors uf the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods In reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers Is but an en largement of our present policy of river control under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams. The uoveininent should construct ana maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works. Where their purpose Is to regulate the How of streams the water should be turned freely into tne cnanueis In the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow. "The reclamation and settlement of tne arid l toll- will enrich every portion of our country, .uist as the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys orougni pros perity to the Atlantic states. The In creased demand for manufactured arti cles will stimulate It.duatrlal production, while wider home markets and Ihe trade of Asia will coiiKiune the larger food sup plies and ettectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture. In deed, the p:iducts or Imitation will be consumed chietly in upbuilding local cen ters of minii and other industries wnicn would other v.lsc not come Into existence at all. Our : cople as a whole will prolit, for successful homemaking Is but another name for the upbul.n og ol the nation." He counsels against a'.tenip-.iiig ioo ruutii i is in nl hi, hoi a.Kii,ii that we let experience on a small plan teach the pos siiiilltlrs of i; realer Li:dertaklnas. He also cites the conditions under which the set tlers of the west are attempting to ouuu homes on ihvc arid .ar.os, ar.u says: "The security and value of ths homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to wattr, but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation uf court decisions rendered li. ordinary suits at law. With a few crfdliable exceptions, the. arid slates have tailed to provide for the crrtalr. ai d Just division of streams in limes of scarcity. L'ix;r.d uncertain laws have mabc It possible to establish rights to witer In excess of uctual uses or ne cessities, tin", many streams have already passed Into private ov. ni rsnlp or a control equivalent to ownership.

Considerable attention Is given the col onies, and t-Hiecially the Philippines. This section of the message begins bv cltlna- the needs of Hawaii and Porto Kloo, of which he says: "In Hawaii our aim must be to develop mo territory on tne traditional American lines. We do not wisn a region of large etale -tilled by cheap labor. We wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the Islands should be shaped with this end In view. The well being of the average homemaker must afford the true test of the healthy devel opment of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possioie oe moaeiea on our homestead system. Of Porto Rico he says the Island is thriv ing as never before, and Is being adminis tered efficiently ana nonestiy. ne aeems no legislation necessary except that con cerning the public lands of the Island. He calls attention to the fact that In Cuba the Independent government of the island' will soon bs In control, and In the same connection urges strongly the need of reciprocal trade relat'ons with the new nation, upon which subject he says: "In the case of Cuba there are weighty reasons of morality and of national Inter est why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnest ly ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed to the vital need, of providing for a sub stantial reduction In the tariff duties on Cuban Imports Into the United ' States. Cuba has In her constitution affirmed what we desired that she should stand In Inter national matters In closer and more friend ly relations with us than with any ether power, and we are bound by every consid eration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures la the Interest of her material well being." For the Philippines he recommends much In the way of legislation, but again coun sels caution that we go neither too far nor with too great haste. He says: "We hope to make our administration of the Islands honorable to our nation by making It of the highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves, and as an earnest of what we Intend to do we point to what we have done. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained In the Philippines than ever before in their his tory." He says we do not desire to do for the Islanders "merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign goverr.men's. We hone to do for them what has neve- before been done for any people of the tropics to mske them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really free nations." But the Idea of the president Is that we eannet leave the islands at this time, of whleh he says: "To leave the Islands at this time would mean that they would fall Into a w-lter of murderous anarchy. Buch a desertion of duty en our part would be a crime against humanity." .. But he believes sufficient progress has been made along the lines under which wo have been working in the lalhnds te war rant us In passing new legislation, but In this connection he urges the need of oau tieo. He believes the time has come when the Industries of which the Islands ars capable should be encouraged by grantiag franchises for their development, and of this he says: .

The Monroe Doctrine.

He says nlsu that "this doctrine has nothing o do with the com mercial relations o: anv Amer ean power save that It 'n truth t!lnw euth of them to form such as It desires." That "we do not ask for any exclusive commercial treaty with any other American state." He says of this: "The Monroe doctr ne should bo tha cardinal feature of the forcinn policy of all the nations of the two Americas aa It Is of the United States. .lust 78 years have passed since Troild-nt Monroe In his annual messac? aninc.-.iced that 'the American continent arc henceforth not to be considered as subjects for futura colonization by any Ki ropran power.'

Ihe Viivy, , - The president ttrRts-thr continued Tip build ing oi .he navy as a means ot per forming our ir.urr.a:.,r.al cutles us well as a protection anu"sali guard for our Inter national rights. He urgts that uur place Ss a first-class powr necessitates tho building and malr.it nance of a navy In keeping with our place among the nation of the world, and tayr: "So far from btlnt; Ir. .'.i.y way a provo cation to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the Vai (,-ur.rantee against war, the cheapest and most effective peace Insurance. The cost o! building ar.d main taining such a navy : .'efcrts the very lightest premium for !:-.st.rir:B pace which this nation car. possibly niy. Hi? recommends both 'he construction of more ships and the addition of more officers and men as absolutely necessary, and says: "There should be no cessation In th work of completing our nsvy. so far in genuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the e-reat war craft whoso hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas. It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several addl- tlinul 1.1 1 1 IwBhlnB uril hlf1l irmnr.4 1 cruisers, with auxiliary nml lighter craft In proportion. For the exact number and character I refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy. But there Is some thing we need oven more than iddltlnnal ships, and th ri Is ndd'tlonal officers and men. To provide Jm'.tlcships and cruis ers and then lay them up, with the ex- . pectatlon of leaving them unmanned un til they are needed In actual war. would . be worse than folly. It would be a crime I against the nation.

Four thousand additional sea men and a thousand additional marine shoiild be pnrlded. and an Increase in the officers thould be provided by making a large addition to the classes aeaAnnap oils. There is one small matter which should be mentioned In connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean ing title of ':.aval cadet' should be abol ished: the title of 'midshipman,' full of historic association, should be restored. "We now have IT battleships appropri ated for, of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual service. The remaining eight will bo ready In from two to four years, but It will lake at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It Is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by ths time they are com missioned. Good ships and rood guna ara simply good weapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who knew how to fight with them. The men mils: be trained anJ drilled un der a thorouch and well-planned system of progressive Instruction, while the re cruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort mut be made , to exact the main function of the officer the orrfrnsnd of mon. The leading grad uates of Ihe i-sval academy should be as ' signed to the combatant branches, tha line ana marines. The Army. No Increase In the regular army I deemed necessary at this time, but there are several changes In that branch of the government service which the presldest recommends to congress. Chief of thee Is the establishment of a staff department, hnd of -thls-heeevet "A general staff should be created. Am rnr tfca e-enrat itaS aa3 aurDfv la.. merits, iney snouta ui oy setstlt from the line, ths men so detailed rerurv lnc sfter awhile to their Use duties, u u v.rv undesirable to have the senior mi. of the army composed of men w-he hive f men w-he hive i by the mere tact ihould be adopts e an efi.sur.aUQn f o who aetm meet come to nu tne pessuens oy in of seniority.

Justice to ue veterans at t & civil war who are still la the army m tn reaulra that In the matter tirements tney gii r i" sasa privileges accorded to their comrades thAnot her recommeodatioa whleh the pres ident makes In oonneetloa with the artsy is for the reduction of the "paper work" of the service, known to the public as "red tape." Ot this he says: "Every effort should bo made to bring the army to a constantly increasing stats of efflclenoy. 'When on actual tervlee, ne work save that directly In the line of such service should be required. The paper ' work In ths army, as in the navy, atioult be greatly reduced. What la Beaded Is proved power of command and capaelty to work wall In the fleid. ConsUal oars is necessary to prevent dry rot la the transportation and eommlsoary depart ents." . He also urges the aaaetraeat of legis lation in oonneoUoa with the militia and national guard forcas of the aatlen that they may be better Ailed for acWve serf. Ice In time at war, and saya: "Our mlUtla law Is obsolete had worth less. The organlaatiea and armament at the national guard ot the several states, whleh are treated as militia In th a proprlatlona by the congress, should made Identical with these provided tha rae-ular fares. The obligations duties of th guard la tlm of war should be carefully defined and a system estab lished by law under whloh th method of procedure of raising voluateer fetre should bo prosorlbed In advance. It I t terly Impossible in th excitement arfl haste of Impending war to do this aaflsl lactorlly If th arrangements hav nol been mad long beforehand. Provision should bo made tor utlUsiag tat the ffrst volunteer organisations sailed out th training ot those citizens who hav aK reaoy naa experience unaor arraa, n especially tor ina selection in aavanc el the officer of any force which may b raised; tor careful selection ot the kind necessary 1 impossible after th outbreak ot war." He praises tha veterans of th elvll war, the war with Spain and those wh hav rendered th nation valiant aervloe In th Indian uprising of tho west and In th Philippines, and oounsels oentlnued lib erality In the nation's dealing with them, Th Civil lervleo. He recommends th enactment f legis lation that will place under th ruling of the merit systen, many olasaes ot em ployes not now governed by it. His rec ommendation for this is aa follows:- "I recommend the passage ot a law which will extend the alasslned service t the District ot Columbia or will at lsast enable the presldsnt thus to extend It, In my Judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of dUrk should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the civil service law." He also wishes the merit system to ob tain In the government service In th -colonies, und says: ' Not an office should bo filled In th Philippines or Porto Rlon with any regard to the man's partisan affiliations or serv ices, with any regard to the peUtloal, so cial or personal Influence which he may have ct his command. In short, heed anouia do paia to absolutely nothing save me man s own cnaracter an caoael ens ot las osrVice. The administration of thaaa ' lalai should be as wholly free from tha aus. niclon of partisan politics as th admin istration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant in th Philippines or Port Rico lb that h re flect honor on his oountry by th way Ik which he makes that country's rule benefit to the peoples who have come un der It. This 1 all that w slwulj ask, and we cannot afford to be content with ' less." Other Recesaaaendafleae. Among other recommendations whloh th president makes er these asking for lei' Islatlonthat will Improve the apnaular serv ice along lines eutllnsd tn bltts sMredVoed at previous sessions, and he ears that: "It Is true that the service Is new In th main efficient, but a standard of oscslleno cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth In the bill hero- -tofore submitted to ths congress on tha subject are enacted Into law." He believes the time has arrived whe the Indian should cease to be treated as member of a tribe, but as an lBdrvlduaL and recommends breaking up th tribal funds, putting a stop to the Indtscrlmlaat permission to Indians to lease their allot ments and stopping the ration system. M recommends also the establishment of aa Industrial educational system, and an en deavor to encourage the Indians to became rattle raisers rather than agricufturssU Where their lands are unsulted to tn latter.v He recommends liberal appropriations fl the Louisiana Purchase exposition and ah appropriation covering expenses lncurrel -by the Chailsslun expoTTlTon Tn removing V government exhibits from the Buffalo x- position to that at Charleston. 1 Another of his recommendations Is for ' a permanent census bureau, as it era sum ueue leaner and more aatlsfactars work In the Interest of business, statistic, -economic and social science. " The Postal Service. He calls attention to the growth ef th postal system and to the fact that th an nual deflolt in this department of tho gov ernment service has been reduoed to the small sum of $3. 114,727. This, bs saya, could furthef be Increased and possibly a surplus shown but for the fact that many publi cations are now securing the pound rate as seoond-class mall matter which are net entitled to the same under the law. OI this he says: "The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the Intrenched and well-understood abuses which have frown in con nection with secsnd-class mall matter. The extent of this buruen appear when It Is stated that, while the seoond-class mat ter makee nearly three-fifths of tho weight ot all the mall, It paid for the last fiscal year only U.1M.M of the aggregate postal revenue of I111.M1.193. if the pound rata of postage, which produces th large less thus entailed and which was fixed by th conn-rets with the purpose of encouraging - . the dissemination of nubile Informanan. we:o limited to the legitimate newspaper and periodicals actually contemplated by the law. no Just exception oould be taken. That expense would be the reoognlged and accepted cost of a liberal public polley de- uocraieiy aaopi-a ior a JusiutaDl and. J nut mucn or the matter which enjoys thd privileged rate la wholly outsida of tha intent of the- law and has secured admis sion only through an evasion ef lu re- euilremrr.'.s or through lag construotleh. The proportion cf such wrongly inoiuded matter is estimated by postal sport to ''be one-half cf the whole volume of second class mail. If it be only one-thlrff er oae quarter, the magnitude of tho burden la ' apparent. The post office denertnaeet ha now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as possible by a stricter application of the law, and It should be sustained li iia euuri. The Chinese Dl moult toe. He calls attention to the satisfactory settlement of the Chinese dlMcuitle ef iai year, una lais nation s part IB th settlement, and says provisions hav been made for insuring the future safyir of the foreign representatives. Of th promises made by China he say: "The Chinese government haa agreed ts) participate financially In the work of bet tering the water approach to Shanghai nd to Tientsin, the centers of foreign! trade In central and northern China, tu an International conservancy board k which the Chines government 1 laraex ...... ..... , Mota wwii prvTiuafj xor cass Improvement of the Shanghai river -nj r-v;,"""""".",m:s"""?' lnthajie)V e a revtstee. irta haa bessa V of subotltwa. ..... w,
