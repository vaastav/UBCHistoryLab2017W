1 r 4 i' 4 V " i it A AilY WKDXES91Y. BECSJiBtR , is;r. resident's Message, j We rrlnt tte message in full this j morning, on the seccni page. As it ' 13 quite short, when comrarcd with j most of its predecessors, we presume ; everybody Trill carefully read it for j themselves, and make up their own oriaiona as to its merits cr demerits. The views of tha President upon the j different questions to which he calls the attention of Congress are easily understood, lie has not learned the art of rasing lacgusgo to conceal ideas. What he thinks he declares in plain English, and the common peo ple can as clearly comprehend him as can statesmen acd diplomatists. Whether his opinions be right or . wronjr, is open to discussion. But there can be no discussion as to what these opinions arc. The President urge?, with great pertinacity, the annexation of the Island of b'in Domingo, and devotes considerable of his menage to the dis cussion of that question. We are of the opinion that the reoplc are tired of the Government speculations in Real Estate, and have as little anxiety to own the tornados and earthquakes of Fan Domingo, as they had to pur chase the icy mountains and valleys and half-starved Indians of Russian Ameno. The people are net hanker ing after any more States or Islands. The President thinks, of course, that Congress should legislate to re store specie payments, as everybody else does. We apprehecd, however, that the kind cf legislation most needed is that which will most rabidly devtlop the resources of the ooun try, and keep down the expenditures of the Government to the lowest pos sible limit. Gen. Grant has already done well in this particular, but there is still room for improvement in some of the Departments. What will.no doubt, treatly con found the reformers and new party men, the President comes out cqnare ly in favor of reform in the Civil Ser vice, so as to provide for both ap pointment and tenure, and relieve Cocsressmen from the thankless and disagreeable labor of proeuriog ap pointments. As stated by a eotemporary, the message runs largely to details taken from the department reports, and shows a desire to make a full present ation of the business of the country. Its greatest argumentative force is devoted to iSa Domicgo. It con cludes with a general stitement of the ,, policy of the administration, which is everything that can be wished. In this his statement of the rule that the tariff taxation should hi reduced in uehawayas to give relief to the greatest cumber is the very principle of tariff reform. We have not undertaken to eurc niariz J all the topics treated in the message. It will be tiicersaty for every one to read it io order to appre" elate it. tJDSX3K3 IiLRGKASS.

Several bills were introduced, when the Senate adjourned in order to com plete the informal Revision of Stand in? Committees. Senate bills were introduoed as fol lows: Mr. Harlan, to authorize the election of a delegate to Congress from Indian Territory,- Mr. Scott, to repeal so much of the act of July 14, lb.O, as continues the income tax af ter December Lllst,

An order was informally issued for the complete revision of the standing committees. The Senate at 12: 35 ad journed. .,.. - ".. . HOUSE... ..WASUtNf;TON, Cecil. . The bill rassed by the Senate at the last session, extending the time for the construction of the Railroad from the St; Croix lUver to the west end of Lake Superior, and to Bayfield, came up as the regular order of business in the morniog hour. It extends tha term of the jrrant for seven years, from the first of May, ISG'J, provided that thirty miles be completed within eighteen months, and thirty miles every year thereafter. The bill was explained and advocated by Wilson, of Minnesota. The bill was further explained and advocated by Mr. Washburne, of Illinois, who stated in reply to the questions of Mr. Walker, that Iho length of the road wis originally 350 miles; nearly 2110 miles being com pleted and in running order, and the j remainder was under contract, and the quantity of land required would le about 1,000,000 acres. 3Ir. Wood opposed tho biiL, declar-1 ing that it would be but a continna- lion of the swindling system by which j tbe public lands had been given away to private corporations. Mr. Julian desired to have the bill amended so as to. exclude timbered land from the grant. a Mr, Lawrence desired to have the coal lands excluded, and require the liailroad Company to sell the land to actual settlers on!y, and in qiantities not exceeding a quarter section, and not exceedicg ?2 50 an acre. Mr. Wilson argued that it wes now admitted that publio lands should g) to actual settlers; Congress should adopt that polity which would . prove most advantageous to settlers, and that was the openiog up of commu nications by railro-.d.-i. After further diacussioc, the bill was laid on the table. ' Messrs..

EVANSY Letter from Minister Washburn on the Provisions tn Paris Butler of Tennessee Tne Illinois Senator ship Sumner Amendment to the rnndlns Law Losait on Reduction or the JiaTy. Washington, December 6 Repre sentative Washburn, of Wisconsin, has received a letter from his brother, our Minister to France, in which he says that the people of Paris have provisions enough to hold out until the first of January. Kepresentative Roderick 11. Butler, of Tennessee, is here, but did not an swer to his name yesterday. His friends say he will appear in the House to-day and make personal ex planation, during which he will refer to the damaging charges which havo been made against him in connection with the pension frauds, and demand an investigation by Congress into the whole subject. Tbe election of General Logan to the United States Senate from Illi nois, in place of Yates, is regarded as certain. Of the 125 Republican mem bers of the Illinois Legislature, SO are claimed by Logan's friends as pledged to him. The remainder are divided between Gov. Palmer, Gen. Ojjlesby and Gen. Koerner. Senator Sumner states that the ob ject of his bill introduced jesterdny. but upon which he could not obtain an action, is to stop the running of the presses in the Treasury Department and prevent the future printing of United States currency in the place of worn-out notes. He believes this course will gradually contract the cur rency and bring about specie pay ments. The bill provides for amend ing the funding law increasing the five per rent, bonds from $200,000,000 to 500,000,OCO. The Senator doea not believe that bonds bearing a lower rate of interest can be negoti ated under the present condition of finances. - General Logan will introduce, as soon as possible, a resolution abolish ing the office of Admiral in the navy at once, and the office of Vice Ad miral as soon as a vacancy occurs. This will relieve the navy to an equal ity of rank with the army grades ef General and Lieut. General, which are, by virtue ot the army reduction aet of last session, to be discontinued as soon as vacancies occur. Logan intends to press this measure before any confirmation is made by the Senate of an appointment to fill the vacancies occasioned by the death of Admiral Farragut. The Xrir French Minister Republi can Caucus The Uevenue Tax on Gas Motley Going to Holland. Washington. Deo. C. Viscount Treilhard to-day. in accordance with previous arrangement, called at the Executive Mansion and presented his credentials. . which were acepted by the President. , The R?publicin Caucus of the Sen ate held a brief se-sion this morning. at which a committeo was appointed to nominate members for the various standing committees of the Senate. In response to a letter from Chas. Roome, President of the Manhattan Gaslight Company of New xork, an nouncing his appeal from the assess ment of $2,653,873 for gas sold dar ing the month of October last, upon the ground that the aot of 1870 repeal led all laws imposing taxes on sales, repeals the tax on gas. Acting Com mUs oner Douglass says the liability! of the Manhattan Gaslight Company, in common with all Gas Companies in the country, to be assessed and pay taxes on all gas manufactured, con sumed or sold by them, ia too plain to admit of any question; but if the Manhattan Gislight Company is of a different opinion, and such is the de cision of the Court, the Internal Rev enue Office will oppose no obstacla, except to make such a defense before the Court as may be necessary to pro tect the interests of the Government in the eolleotion of the taxes which L'ocgr(S has imposed. In a private letter to a friend here, Minister Motley writes that he has received on autograph letter from the Queen of Holland, tendering him the tree use of her elegant mansion at Hague, to enable him to complete the history of, the Netherlands. This of fer Motley has accepted, and will pro ceed to Hague to commence his lite rary labors aa soon as he reoeives in struotioos to turn over bis office to the first Secretary of Legation. Comments of the Press on the Presi dent's Message. Nkw York. December G. Al' the Metropolitan jiurnals have elaborate comments upon the President's mesage and accompanying State documents this morniog. The Tribune thinks that the prominent feature of his ad ministration had already commanded popular approbation, but this mes sage will still more endear the l'resi dent to the hearts of his countrymen. The writer thinks that in regard to San Domingo the President is clearly right in his position, if not misin. formed as to material facts, aod sub mits that Congress will be constrained by public pentiment to admit San UouaiDgo into our Union, unless it can be made to appear that her peor pie are preponderantly averse to such a union. tte tbiuks tbe President a patience is almost exhausted by the Cuban outrages, but regrets the si lence in the message as regards the Alabama ' claims, and esteems the President's suggestions and recom mendtioa with regard to the publio land and land grants, as wise and timely. The Herald thinks tue President's Messass is a good State naner and a staunch party platform, and that as an exhibit ot the management under his supervision of the Government in our foreign and domestic affairs, that there is much in it tb&t is good and encouraging, and as tne torcsbadow ing of the general policy of his admin istration, and that there is nothing io it calculated to disturb tbe general confidence of the country. The limes says tbe message is tbe best answer to those who insist that the mission of the Republican party is ended, or impugn General Grant's ntness for interpreting tbe wishes and promoting the interests of the people, and that tho policy set forth is at once positive and practical. The writer thinks it is clear that the President has no idea of plunging the nation recklessly into war, tH a means of manufacturing capital; yet there is nevertheless, a rather striking sug- gestiveness in a brief paragraph which he devoted to the Alabama claims, and the mildness of the Pres ident in reference to that question renders more significant the firmness of his remarks in regard to the fish cries. The World severely criticises the message, and thinks it is a document which needs a cool deal of jinnow inz to separate the small amount of grain from the heavy chaff in which it is buried. The writer saya that the request of the President for authority to appoint a oommission to investigate and audit the damages of individuals by the Alabama depredations, with a view to their payment by our own Government, is a proceeding entirely without preoedent, and that if his a 1 vioe is accepted, a preoedent will be set for making the Government re sponsible for the reparation of dam ages Bustaiood by our merchantmen at the hands of foreign powers as inci dent to wars. ' " ibe bun can nod uttie merit or satisfaction in the message, and terms it "a poverty stricken document. ' St. Thomas, December 1, via Ha vana. December G.

All commu nications with the interior of France is severed, Tribune 8pcUl.l HOKI FIGHTING. A Tribune correspondent writes from Versailles, onthe 1st; The German loss was inconsidera ble. The shells fell at a greater range than it was believed the for's could oarry, reaohiog beyond Montmorency. The whole range vi G.300 metres. At Epcrnay the French made a rust) at three in the afternoon, and surprised a battalion of the 71st.- Un der a heavy fire from Briohe, tha French simultaneously burst out from St. Peuis.1 and the gunboats coming down stream swept the banks clear of German forces and lauded a foroQ at Epcrnay, occupying the houses near and west of the village. The French were in overwhelming numbers. The Germans fell back fighting, and evaluated the village. Reinforcements arriving n:ar M. Gratin, the French barricaded Kper nay. The Germans sent the whole Fifteenth Corps, the seventh, first, and thirty-first regiments, six battal ions in all, to retake the village, this force advancing rapidly.

Anotuer aupaion from tbe same correspondent, of December 31, in tbe afternoon, says the German offi cers believe the siege may still ex tend beyond .Christmas, on militarv grounds, but they hope the French are discouraged by tho failures of the recent sorties, especially by the final recapture of Champigny, yesterday.

The pa pers this morning, commenting cn the President's raessege, Eay, with refer - ence to the enloreement of Canadian rights in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, that the President does not found his objections against tbe action of our government upon the seizure of ves- eels actually engaged in fishing within fnrhiddfin boundaries, but on trip (jpi7- re ana examination ot vessels sus pected of a design to violate the reg ulations of the Canadian Government. He states that, while the Canadian act permits such seizures and examin- ations, the law has not yet been put ! in farce, and is resolved to '. postpone action until actual of fense has been given, . whether such : seizure and examination form a nee'es- I sary part of the police duty of our ! navy aa a question tor the Govern ment to consider. We need hardly if these proceed - say, however, that if these proceed ings are necessary to driving out in truders from cur waters, the lajv ought to be enforced, whatever ob jection may be made by the American Government, or threats of retaliation which the President holds cut. Ca nadian vessels will bo refused admis sion to American ports, and if tho bonded system, as it is called, under which Canadian merchandise passes through the Uni ted States, be suspended, it will not have the slightest effect in preventing the assertion ot the just rights of Canada in the waters of the Gulf. That a number of Cacadian vessels are entering American ports is quite insignificant. Tha stoppage of the bonding system might cause some in convenience to individuals in Canada, but it would enormously benefit other parties, and the chief injury would fall npon American transportation lines. President Grant may try meas ures of coercion whenever he likes. It will not cause the people ot Canada to abate their claims one jot or tithe. The President asserts the right of the United States to the free navigation of the St. Lawrence. - It is hardly worth while to dispute this claim. Whatev er rights the American people may possess to the navifation of the river, they oertainly have none to the canal along the banks. Whenever the re quest has been made to permit the passage of American vessels down the river, it has always been granted, and the question will hardly allege, there fore, that the right of the States on the lakes, which he makes so much of, have been seriously injured by the denial of his claim, as in coming up the river, we beg to inform his Excel lency, that the trouble arises. Per haps he has never made a trip from Kingston to Montreal. We assure him, that without the use of our ca nals, Americans would obtain won derfully little advantage from the free navigation of the St. Lawrence. South America the War la Uruguay. Montevideo, Nov. G. Gaucho, leader of the Aparicio, ha out generaled both Suarez and Carabello, defeating them in detail at Casavalle and Corvalito, having at the latter place compelled Carabello to treat for a capitulation. After agreeing to an armistice, Blanco's forces retired a mile. The Colorado Chief stole away under the cover of darkneis, forfeit ing his word of honor to pay land or city bordering on the Uragmy lliver, losing al) his trains and artillery, and by demoralization, one-half of his re maining force. Suarez pus had for ward with all Lis available force, to support Paysander and Apariuio, and with his colleagues, maneuvered sj adroitly that Colorado's forces were left unmolested. Blanco's army, numbering 7,000 men of all arms, then marched 200 miles aq i made their appearanoe at the town of Launeon, three miles from this city, very unexpectedly on the 24:h ult , to lay siege to the Capital, left by their combinations, isolated aod unsup ported by Colorado's armies outside. This city is now defended by 3,f(K) men, who are armed with needle guns, Spencer and Hemington rifles. Constant pioket firing is kept up on both aidea, and quite a number are killed and wounded daily. The loan of $2,500,000, contracted with the house of Lauoa & Co , o! Buenos Ayres, by the Battle Admin istration, is likely to prove fallacious. Tbe Btaoeo party have protested and notified the bankers that, iu the event of their coming into power, they will not recognize the loan. The effeots of the siege is being felt in tha enhanced prices of all articles of daily consumptioa. Meat which sold for six cents per pound last month, now sells at one dollar and a half; milk formerly costing four cents is now worth fifty 02vt per quart.

The miners in the districts operated by the Delaware.Lackawaona & Western Ballroad Company to day resolved, by a vote of l.OoO to 400, to f-uspend work. The company reduced tbe wages of the miners forty-five cents a car. Upon this reduction the suspension is based. All the men at Delaware, in the Hudson Canal Company's works are also out, but apparently not upon def inite action taken by them as in the case of the Delaware, Lackawanna Si Western Company's men.
