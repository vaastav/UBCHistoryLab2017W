GREATER PROSPERITY THAN EVER. The Fresfdent Eulogizes the Protection Tarift System. WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 0. President Harrison's annual mes- 1&, sago wos read to congress today. ' The president begins with a state ment that the people of the United States are now en joying greater ' prosperity than ever before and i deals largely with statistics to show i this is the caso. He says in part: . The total wealth of the country in 1800 was $17,158,610,068. In 1890 it amounted to $02,010,000,000 an in crease of 287 per cent. The offlclul rotiirnn nt tlin eleventh 

CBDBUB and those of the tenth for 76 leading citieB furnished the basis of the fol lowing comparisen: In 1880 the capital invested in manufacturing was $1,232,830,070; In 1800, $2,000, 735,884. In 1880 the 'number of employes was 1,801,888. In 1880 the wages earned were $601,005,778; in 1890, $1,221, 170,454- In 1880 the value of product was $2,711,670,090; in 1890, $4,860,280,837. RAVINOS HANKS Another indication of the general prosperity of the country is iounu in . . . , ... the fact that deposits in the sayings - banks Increased from $104,277,375 in I860 to $1,023,070,749 in 1891, After presenting these statistics the presl 1 ilont savs: There never has been ., ... ' i.iaw h.n wnrk was 8o abundant or when wages were as high, It Is true that the market price of wheat and corn, have been low. It is one of tho unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer cannot produco upon orders He must sow and reap In ignorance of the aggregate production of the year and is peculiarly subject to the disposition which followa over-pro-ductlor But while tho fact I have 3tated is true as to the crops I have mentioned, tho general averages of prices has been such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in general prosperity. Tho value- of our total farm products has increased j from $1,303,040,860 in 1860 to ?4,V 500,000,000 in 1891. If any are dis contented with their state here, If any bellovo that the wages or prices, the returns for honest toil aro inade quate they should not fall to remem ber that there Is no other couutry in the world whero tho conditions that seem to them hard would not ho accepted as highly prosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to exchange tho returns of his labor for those of tho Amorlcan farmer and tho Manchester work men their wages for thoso of their fellows at Fall River. I bellovo that tho protectlvo system which now for something like thirty years has prevailed In our legislation hns been a mighty lustruinout for tho de velopment of our national wealth and a moat powerful auenoy lu pro tecting tho homes of our working men from tho invasion of want. TUB TARIFF. Tho president assumes that the recent election means tho introduc tion of a uow policy of n tarlfl for revenue and recommonds that tho subject bo referred to tho uext con grew. Ho argues the Republican position at length, and sets forth the 1 Advantages of protection to the wag -earner. A

NICARAGUA CANAL.

KKKB SILVEK. In reference to the international monetary conference assserabled at Brussels, the, president says: "I have expressed belief, that the free coinage of silver upon agreed inter national ratio, would probably pro mote the interest of our people in equality with those of the otliur na tious It is too early to predict what results may be accomplishid i... ii... ..r,.-n n oy mu buuiwbum.

The messago concludes by saying: "This brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of tho couutry will give us a level from which to note the increase or decadence that new legis lative policies may bring to us. There is no reason why national In flueuce,power and prosperity should not obsorvo the same rates of in crease that havo characterised tho past thirty years." HILL MAY QUIT POLITICS.

Washington, Dec. 0. An inter e ting document on the subject Of war vessels on the lakes will be sent to the senate by the state depart ment dui ing the week. The inform ulon was asked for by a resolution In the early part of the last session, and considerable surprise was ex pressed that a reply was not receiv ed before congress adjourned. The object of the resolution was to make the state department show cause why the act passed In 1860, requir ing notice to be given Great Brltian of a desire of the United States to abrogate the treaty regarding the uumber of vessels to be kept on the lakes had not been carried out. The reply of the department will be the basis for congressional legisla tion looking to a modification of the treaty, which will admit of the con struction of war vessels by firms on the lakes. The state department ima Kpi.ii nnii9M nf Avnriincr tue jolnt re30iutiou calling for the abro- ,, on of tile treaty. Thoro aro soma peoplo who think the treaty aborgated. There is no doubt that such a resolution was passed, and It Is on record that notice was given Great Brltian In accordance therewith of the intention of this government to abrogate the treaty. What followed is a mystery outside the diplomatic world. It Is under stood tho statement will show the notlco Issued uuder the act was withdrawn within a few days after Issued, and thai, for reasons then existing, both countries agreed to consider the treaty still In forca. It will be further shuwn the treaty is so regarded to tho present day by both governments, notwithstanding tho act of 1860. Tough Killed. Omaha, Neb., Dec. 6.
