DAKOTA COUNTY HERALD; DAKOTA CITY, NEBRASKA. U. S. ARMY'S NEEDS STRIKING REPORT IS ISSUED BY SECRETARY GARRISON MUST BE PREPARED. AN ANSWER TO OPPONENTS Unsparing In Its Criticism of Ultra Pacifists Arfluments of Those Who Would Have No Military Increase Replied To. Wrtrm VrTHptppr t nlon Nw SrTlcf Washington, D. C Secretary Gar rison declaroB In his annual report to the president that It tho adminis tration plan for a continental army falls, tho United States will face some form of compulsory military service. In what many men In official lifo characterize as tho most remarkable report over made by a secretary of war, Mr. Garrison passes quickly over the wide-spread routine activities of tho war department and devotes prac tically all his words to tho subject of military preparedness, the need for which ho sums up by saying: "So long as right and wrong exist In tho world there will bo an inevita ble conflict botween them. Tho right doers must bo prepared to protect and defend tho right as against tho wrong." Unsparing in his arguments in an swer to thoso who would havo no In croaso in tho country's military pre paredness, Secretary Garrison declares that tho American people must vlow their responsibilities nnd measure up to them and then goes on to tako up tho various arguments of the opposi tion Boparatoly. Many Ignore the Facts. "There nro some who do not feel free to base thoir conduct upon a con sideration of facts or conclusions of reason because of their interpretation of dlvino Injunction," ho says. "They do not bcllovo in resistance to physical force; and thoso whoso consciences aro so convinced surrender llfo and nil that they chorlsh and love at tho behest of tho nggressor. Tills attitudo concerns tho individual, and him alone. It cannot bo mado tho general rule of conduct under our form of govern ment without departing from tho basis upon which our government Is found ed. One Is Impelled to query upon what propor consideration thcro Is based any distinction between tho right or necessity or desirability of using mental forco to ropol error, moral forco to ropol ovil, and physical lorco to ropol wrong. It would seem, if reason wore applied, that in each instance tho situation is identical; and that If wo should properly prepare our minds to bo strong so that wo can reject error nnd our moral characters to bo Btrong so that wo can reject evil, wo should likewise make our iphyslcal forco strong in order that wo may maintain tho right as against thoso who would physically Impose tho wrong upon us. Wars Are Bound 'to 'Come. 'Thoro aro others concerning whoso clarity of vision wo nro not advised, and concerning whoso soundness of reason wo aro not Informed, becauso tho attitudo which thoy take is ad mittedly not based upon cither vision or reason. Thoy aro thoso who pro diet 'that war will novor come to this country, and assort that thcroforo pre cautions with roBpcct thereto aro un wise and neodlcss. Sinco wars havo como upon nations from tho earliest date of recorded history to this mo ment, thoro is no basis of fact for Buch .a 'position, but an actual demon stration of tho non-ezistanco ut -such basis. Wo were early warned that there would bo wars nnd rumors of wars, and that nation would rise ngalnst nation nnd kingdom against kingdom and tho end was not yet; and that prediction has been fully vorlllod There is mo basis and no foundation to conclude that thin great ovil 1ms been eliminated, and It thoioforo must bo treated at) aro nil other exlatlng evils and must bo prepared against .Surely, ma ibotwren lestlng upon (pre diction or upon preparation, wisdom would not 'hosltato.

This J position Ignores the responsibilities which wo havo undertaken ami which wo must maintain at any self Biicri fllco. t ignores the ittvct that if nations which possesa forco aire likely to use Jt when thoy should snot, some nation which has hucIi fore Is likely to use It against us when It should nol it BBfiumca that our nntiuu jnay not be trusted with forco for fear that u may mlBuso It.

TIiobo who really fear militarism, or, more accu rately slated, those who dread real militarism, should be tho strongest advoevtw of reasonable preparation The lattor is tho preventive of mili tarism. If they unwisely dofeat rea sonable preparednoss, they leave tho country in a condition where tho inev itable result ot dofeat, humiliation or ncuto apprehension will bo hasty and ill ndvised provisions as to armament far beyond anything which calm rea son nnd wise provision would deem necossury. "Thoro will bo thoso who assert that tho proposed policy opposes tho tradi tions of tho people nnd runs counter theroto. This is more assertion; It is not the fact, and in truth the fact 1b to tho contrary. Tho proposed policy is exactly In keeping with our tradi tions. "Thcro also will bo thoso who will oxpross regret that tho policy hero- toforo pursued, of lack ot proper mill tary precautions, is to bo departed from becauso It has been invaluable as an example to tho rest ot tho world and wo should not remedy tho lack becauso wo would then cease to be such an example. It should be ob served first, in considering this point of view, that it entirely overlooks tho vital and imperative duty to ourselves which requires that wo should pro tect and defend that which wo cherish and hold dear. Furthermore, it over looks the fact that although we havo been Just tho example that they desire throughout tho more than a century and a quarter of our existence, the re sults existing In tho world today do not warrant tho belief that our ex amplo has had any beneficial effect. U. S. Should Be Prepared. "Thoro aro some who decry taking any precautions or making any prepa rations of tho military power of tho nation becauso they say it will not prevent war, but will provoke It. Men and nations must prepnre to meet their responsibilities; If It 1b inudvL Bublo to develop strength sufficient to icpcl wrong becauso such developed strength may bo misused, human na ture has Indeed reached an Impasse. Why should it bo presumed that n Just man or a Just nation will cease to bo Just becauso it lias tho power to be unjust? Wo must cithor truBt others or trust uuTHoIvcm. "Another stumbling block to somo is tho suggestion that no preparation should bo made and no precaution should ho tuken becauso no ono can fortoll how much wo may havo to meet nnd what wo will requiro to meet it Hero again tho Idea embodied In this suggestion would stay all human prog ress. There will bo somo who assert that tho devastating offects and the horror produced by tho war now be ing waged mako it certain that war will bo avoided for a long period of tlmo aftor the closo of tho present war. Thoy will argue that tho exhaus tion of resources anditho recollection ot tho awful suffering will havo tho effect of deterring nations from en torlng upon war. What basis is there for such beliot? Certainly such basis cannot bo found In history our own or that of othor nations. Advocates of Arbitration. "(Thoro will bo thoso who believe and assert that the tlmo when wur can bo avoided by negotiation or arbitra tion or other llko menus will be ad vanced It wo refrain from adopting a ipropor military policy, but will be set back if wo do so. It Is difficult to comprehend on what basis such a bo liefcan reasonably roat, and thcroforo It 1b difficult to reason about It. It seems to rest upon tho idea that if wo nro fooblo and weak In action, wo will bo strong nnd porsuiiBlvo In coun sel; that by avowedly neglecting to prepare tto iprotect our rights 'Wo wll bo the better able to securo their pro tection oy appeal, by arbitration, or by argumont. No ono need havo tho slightest fear that our volco for peace ful sattloment of tho quarrels of na tions will rocelvo nny tho less atten tion becauso wo stand for tho right nnd nro prepared to maintain It at any proper cost. On tho contrary, tho volco of such a ono is always lis tened to and usually controls.

It s surely not necessary to state 'tho many reasons whyithls force may not bo supplied by a regular standing army of thnt number constantly under urnm. There is no legal way that tho National Guard cun, In tlmo of rouee, bo governed, ofUcerod, or tralnod by tho national government; nnd there Is no legal way, oxcoptlng by volunteer ing, that It enn bo made avallablo to tho nation in time of war to nny great er oxtent than spoclfletl In the con stitution, which confessedly falls ehmt of tho necessary Ubes to which mi army may have to bo put In tho ovemt of a war with n foreign nation Plans for Bin.

The report takes up in detail tho plan ot military preparation already mado public and Indorsed by Presi dent Wilson, and declares tho Swiss and Australian systems are founded on governmental Institutions and pow ers differing bo radically from thoso in tho United States that any attempt to adapt either to American uso would mean great delay. "Enough hoB been said to demon strate," the secretary concludes, "that to get something done now something thnt Is well worth while tho best course is to recognize and operato un der existing conditions. Tho other course Is to Imagine a vain thing and accomplish nothing." 300 HOMES BURNED. Fierce Fire Almost Obliterates Hope well, Va. No Lives Lost. Hopewell, Va. This mushroom town of 25,000 people, grown up Blnco last summer with tho great new ex plosive plant of tho Du Pont Powder company, was almost wiped off tho map lato December 0 by a lire which started in a restaurant and did prop erty damage estimated at consider ably more than a million dollars. The Du Pont works outstdo of tho settle ment were not damaged, although for a tlmo seriously threatened. Scones of wild disorder accompa nied tho flio, and citizens nro said to havo lynched a negro for looting. There was no loss of life otherwise, however, and only a few minor in juries were reported. Martial law Is being enrorced by seven militia companies brought to tho scene by a special train under orders from Gov. Stuart. While many of tho buildings In the eastern section of the town wcr saved by a strong wind blowing In tho opposlto direction, somo 300 houses wcro destroyed and thousands of per sons left homeless. An oil stove which was accidentally turned over in a boarding house res taurant started tho conflagration. Fed by a small stream of oil from the ntovo, tho flro leaped from building to building with amazing rapidity. Tho arrest of a foreigner in tho plant Wednesday on tho bollet that ho was a spy led to tho report that tho lire was started by conspirators. Officials, however, said there wbb no foundation for such a theory. PEACE HOPES DAZED. Teuton Chancellor Says Allies Must Act If End of War Is Desired. Merlin. So long as uncontrolled hatred of Germany nnd the belief that Germany Is approaching a collapse continues to bo tho dominant idea of her foes, It would bo folly for Ger many to tako tho Inltlatlvo In propos ing terms of peace.
