The duke of Aumale keeps up the old French custom of having the oldest hound of the pack solemnly blessed at a mass on St. Hubert’s day, the 3d of No vember. He and his guests assembled at the parish church at 4 A. M. The dog, Rabagaa, held on the steps of the altar by the huntsman, was a little sur prised when it was sprinkled with holy water and an Orleans cockade attacked to its neck, but abstained from any such grave breach of decorum as that com mitted by his predecessor, Carbeau, which last year devoured a taper. At the elevation of the Host six huntsmen sounded on their horns the blast of Bt. Hubert, and as the audience left the church they gave the “Reveii du Veneur,” “Conde” and “D’Orleans.” At eleven o’clock the Orleans princes and three hundred guests hunted a stag. THE MESSAGE. Annual Communication of President Hayes. Read to Congress on Monday, Bee. 1. Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives : The members of tho Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first regular session under circumstances call ing for mutual congratulations and grateful acknowledgement to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most in teresting events which have occurred in our public affairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the Government directly affecting (he business interests of ihe country. Resumption. 1 congratulate Congress on the successful execution of the Resumption act. At the time fixed, and in the manner contemplated by law, United States notes began to be redeemed in coin, Since tho Ist of January last they have been prompt y redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, they are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the kreasuiyfor gold and silver in exchange for United states notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes' has been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is about 140,000,000. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are ena bled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing foreign demand for our manufact ures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the Ist of July last to Nov. 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Public Credit. Since the resumption of specie payments there has been a marked and gratifying im provement of tli© public credit. The bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent, inter est have sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemable under the present laws. The amount of interest saved annually bv the process of refunding the debt sine® March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177, The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt, which matures in less than two years, is •792,121,700. of which $500,000,000 bear interest at tho rats of 5 per cent It is believed that tins part of the public debt can be re funded by the issue of 4-per-cent, bonds, and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected about $11,000,000 can be an nually saved to the treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by tli® United States, further legislation is re quired, which it is hoped will bo provided by Congress during its present session. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States during the last fiscal year was $40,986,- 912. Silver Coinage. The coinage of silver dollars since the pass age of the act for that purpose up to Nov. 1, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the treasury, and re now iu circulation, and $32,300,500 are still in the possession of the Government The pen dency of tho proposition for urny of action be tween she United Slates and the principal com mercial nations of Europe to effect a perma nent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject The groat revival of trade, in ternal and foreign, will supply during the coming year its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further experimental measures with the coinage. J would, however, eirongly urg® upon Congroea the importance of authorizing the Secretary of tho Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely lees than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticabla to main tain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a cur rency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the tunvoraally-recognizcd money of the world. Legal Tenders. The retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity or legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our jirogress to a fair and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of the legal-tender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except iu extreme emerg ency, is without warrant in the con stitution, and a violation of sound finan cial principles. The inane of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of legal tender between private indi viduals, was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the ac complishment of this purpose was not contem plated by the framers of the laws under which they were issued. They anticipated the re demption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period consistent with the attainment of tho object for which they were provided. Sinking Fund. The policy of the United States steadily ad hered to from the adoption of the constitution has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when, from necessity, in tho time of war, debts have been created, they have been been paid off on the return of as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this pur pose, it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund suffi cient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that.ex perience has shown that a duty cun be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars an nually to the treasury. Tli© Suppression of Polygamy. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and pun ishment of polygamy demands tho attention of every department of the Government, This Territory has a population sufficient to en title it to admission as a State. The general interests of the nation, as well as the welfare of tho citizens of the Territory, require its advance from the Territorial form .of Government to the responsibilities and and privileges of a State. This itu- Eortant change will not, however, bo approved y the country while the citizens of Utah, in very considerable number, upheld a practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this offense was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah because of the peculiar difficulties attend ing its enforcement. The opinion widely pre vailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the constitutional guar antee of religions freedom. This objection is now removed. Tho Su preme Court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress, and binding, as a rule of action, for all who resided within the Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectively executed, if Dot sufficiently stringent in its provisions, it should bo amended, and, in aid of the purpose in view, I recommend that more com prehensive and more searching methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedience to the law, the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Territories of the United States may be with held or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject Popular Fights. The elections of the past year, though occupied only with State offices, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which attended them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of tho deep interest which the groat body of citizens take in the progress of the country toward a more general and complete establish ment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people, both in the sphere of National and State authority, I find no reason to qualify tho opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administrative interests of Government, however urgent or weighty, will ever destroy the zeal of our people in de fonso of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will over ride all political prejudices and all sectional and State attachments in demanding that all over pur wide territory the name and character of citizens of tho United States shall mean one and the came thinp.and carry with them unchal lenged security and respect.' I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of tho Executive and Legislative authorities of the States in this great purpose. I am fully con vinced that if the public mind can he set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no serious object will thwart or delav the complete pacification of the country, or re tard the general diffusion of prosperity. Civil-Service Reform. In a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the Government, and expressed the intention of transmitting to Con gress, as early as practicable, a report upon this subject by the Chairman of the Civil Serv ice Commission. In view of the fact that during a considerable period tho Government of Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses in various particulars analagous to those present ed in this country and that, in recent years, the measures adopted weie understood to have been effective aucl in every respect highly sat isfactory, 1 thought it desirable to have fuller information upon tho subject, and accordingly requested the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elab orate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth the history of tho partisan spoils sys tem in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the Parliamentary patronage, and of of ficial interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that, after long trials of Tarious kinds of examina tions, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which arc car ried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have with great advantage been established as conditions of admission to almost eveiy official place in the subordinate adminis tration of that country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to the ex tent of the labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Congress to make any provis ion either for the compensation or the expenses of the commission, has been postponed until theresent time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While the measures of another Government are of no authority for ns, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged ex perience has opened my souse of the duty both of officers and of the people themselves to co-operate for their removal The grave evils and perils of a partisan-spoils system of ap pointment to office and office tenure are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great uarties, in the reports of depa tments, in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out, and the need of their reform has been admitted. To command tho necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must bo compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free state. When the people have approved a policy at a national election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and of the ad visers who, in accordance with our political institutions, should be consulted in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, 1? they should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in ihe performance of their official duties. It hardly need be pointed ou; that very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is involved, and their best pub lic service consists in tho discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the same whatever party is in power, and whatever policy prevails. Asa consequence, it follows that their tenure of office should not depend upon the prevalence of any policy or the supremacy of any party, but should Ire determined by their capacity to serve the people most ' usefully, quire irrespective of partisan interests. The same consideration that should govern the tenure should also prevail in the ap pointment, discipline, sod removal of these subordinates. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite which may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised iu the public interest, under all the sanctions winch attend the obligation to apply the public funds only for public purposes. Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering ihe public service of his country. The only just ground of discrimination is the measure of character and capacity he has to make that service most useful to the people. Except in cas. s where, upon just and recog nized principles, as upon the theory of pen sions, offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards of past services, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the ap pointing power is held. In the light of these principles it becomes of great importance to provide just and adequate meat s, especially for every department and large administrative of fice, where personal discrimination on the part of its head is not practicable for ascertaining those qualifications to which appointments and removals should have reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depend, but of necessity to discourage all worthy aspirants by handing over appoint ments anti removals to mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appointment, and the in terest of the people to bestow it upon him, it would seem clear that a wise and just method of ascertaining person al fitness for office must needs be an important and permanent function of every lust and wise Government. It haa long since become impossible iu the great offices for these having the duty of nomination and appoint ment to personally examine into the individual qualifications of more than a small proportion of those seeking office, and with the enlarge ment of civil service that proportion must con tinue to become less. In the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were s > few in number that it was easy for those mak ing appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of the candidates. Party managers and methods had then become powerful agents of coercion hos tile to the free and just exercise of the appointing power, A and responsible part of tho duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon the President; and it has been my purpose to do what is within my power to ad vance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfac tory to a free and intelligent people by a proper exercise of authority. It is in the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform, but it cannot bo too clearly understood th*t nothing adequate can be accomplished without co-operation on the part of Congress and considerate and intelligent support among the people. Reforms which challenge the generally-accepted theories of parties and demand changes in the methods of departments are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundation must be laid in sound principles and in an experience which demonstrates tneir wisdom and exposes the errors of their adver saries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action an honor to his country. But the people themselves, far more than their offi cers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical, and vigorous admin istration. By laws enacted in 1853 and 18.)5. and now in substance incorporated in the Revised Statutes, the practice of arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades iu the great departments was condemned, and examinations as to capacity, to be conducted by the Departmental Boards of Examiners, were provided for and made conditions of ad mission to the public service. These statutes are a decision oy Congress that examinations of some sort as to attainments and capacity are essential to the well-being of the public* ser vice. The important questions since the en actment of these laws have been as to the char acter of these examinations, and whether offi cial favor and partisan influence or com mon right and merit were to control the access to the examinations. In practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish to be examined. Official favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before the examining boards, subjecting even the exam iners to a pressure from the friends of the can didates very difficult to resist. Asa conse quence, the standard of admission fell bel. w that which the public interest demanded. It was almost inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no com mon supervision or uniform method of procedure, should result in confusion, in consistency, and inadequate tests of capacity highly detrimental to the public interest. A further and more radical change was obviously required. In the annual message of December, 18T0, my predecessor declared that “there is no duty which so much embarrasses the Executive and heads of oughly investigate the scope and character of the tests, and the method of determining the results, and these visitors have, without excep tion, approved the modes employed, and several of them have pnblieiy attested their favorable opinion. Upon such considerations, I deem it my duty to renew the recommenda tion contained in my annual message of Decem ber, 1877, requesting Congress to make the necessary appropriations for the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a departments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor im posed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The pres ent system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men. for the public places. The elevation and purifi cation of the civil service ef the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole peo ple of tho United States.” Congress accord ingly passed the act approved March 3,1871, “To regulate the civil service of the United States and promote the efficiency thereof,” giv ing the necessary authority to the Executive to institute a civil-service reform. Acting under this statute, which was interpreted as intended to secure a system of just and effectual exami nations under uniform supervision, a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared with an in telligent appreciation of the requirements of the service, the regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in their capacity as a board, have been known as the Civil Service Commission. Congress for two years appropriated the money needed for ibe compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the commission. It appears from the report of the commission, submitted to the President in April, 1874, that examina tions had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appropriation of about $&5,00U would be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging the duties cf the commis sion. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon the labors of the commission; “If sus tained by Congress, I have no doubt the rul< e can, after the experience gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially benefit the public service, and relieve the Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of de partments from influences prejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hith erto been enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their subordinates in the departments, and in that opinion I concur. And in the annual message of December of the same year similar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing tbe work of ;the commission again advise 1 The appropriation was not made, and, as a con sequence, the active work of the commission was suspended, leaving the commission itself still in existence without the means therefore of causing qualifications to be tested iu any sys tematic manner, or securing for the public ser vice the advantages or competition upon any extensive plan. I recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the work of the commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations, under many embarrassments, have been conducted within limited spheres in the executive depart ments iu Washington, and in a number of the custom houses and postoffices of the principal cities of the country, with a view to further test their effects, and in every instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the administration of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction, wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision for their general supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. Reports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the Postmaster General, from the Post master in the city of New York, where such examinations have been some time on trial, and also from the Collector of the Port, the Naval Officer and the Surveyor in that city,, and from the Postmasters and Collectors m several of the other large cities, show that 'be competitive system, where applied, has in various ways* contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules cannot fail to be of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the Government officers in the city of New York especially bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respect ive offices, showing that these examinations, and the excellent qualifications of those admit ted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons pre viously in the service, and particularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been on the part of those latter an increased inter est in the work, and a desire to extend acquaint ance with it beyond a particular desk, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised. The examinations have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thor moderate compensation to persons in the pub lic service who may perform extra labor upon or under the commission as the Executive may direct. lam convinced that if a just and defiiite test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service, and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and partisan and offi cial interference with the proper exorcise of the appointing power will in large measure disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked iu this connection. Mere partisan appointment and the constant peril of removal without cause very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political activity on the part of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with the due discharge of offi-
