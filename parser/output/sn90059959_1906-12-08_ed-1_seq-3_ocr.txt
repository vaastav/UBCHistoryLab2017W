Y„ Dec. 5.—If Chester Gillette, the alleged slayer of Grace Brown, ever has any fear that the jury would send him to the electric chair, it was Tuesday noon. Gillette had sat through the foreneon session of court while District Attorney Ward closed the case for the people. The prosecu tor insisted that every word that had been presented to the jury from the witness box was indicative of the pris oner's guilt.

ON PACIFIC COAST LABORERS IMPORTED INTO AD LER, WASH., BEATEN AND THREATENED WITH DEATH. CITIZENS AROUSED BY PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Crisis Comes In Dispute Regarding At tendance of Orientals at Schools Provided for White Children—Law Re San Francisco, Dec. 6.—Mob vio lence against the Japanese of the Pa cifis coast began Wednesday, and bloodshed is predicted as a result of the latest, developments at Wash ington. The president's message, announc ing that United States troops might be sent into California, to protect the Japanese in rights te law of Cali fornia denies them, aroused the peo ple. of the state to frenzy. Right, on top of that message came an order from Washington Wednesday, pre sumably by the president, to rush through the courts a test of the law in question, which provides that Mon golian children shall attend schools separate from those provided for white children. "Interference" Stirs Wrath. Reprisals on the Japanese resi dents of the state are expected as a result of the interference, consider ed to be unwarranted, of the federal government with the rights of the state. Not only are the people of California enraged beyond bounds, hut. those of the whole Pacific coast are ready to show their indignation by attacking the Japanese who live among them. Proof of the intensity of the new crisis is found in dispatches from the state of Washington. Dozens of Jap anese laborers were imported into the village of Adler, Wash:, to work in factories of the place. When they left the train they were set upon by a mob that beat them with clubs, kicked them and threatened them with death if they did not return to the cars. Conductor Kirkpatrlck pluckily took the part of the Japanese and cowed the mob. Japanese Threatened with Death. After the train left the mob drove tlie Japanese down the track and told them that if they returned t.o Adler they would l?8 shot. Officers are now investigating the case and arrests probably will be made. A meeting was called in the public hall at Adler to discuss the ar rival of the Japanese. Inflammatory speeches were made. The sheriff of Tacoma, Wash., has been asked for a large force of depu ties to protect the Japanese until they can be conveyed away from Ad ler or given work under a strong In this city the situation is more critical than was ever before imag ined could become. The school board announces that it refuses to recede one iota from the position in excluding the Japanese children from the public schools attended by white children.

This con ference will be held in the rooms of the board. AVhen t.ho attention of President I Allman was called to the president's message he said the utterances of the president, on the Japanese question would have no effect, on the action of the board.

Madrid, Dec. 5.—King Alfonso has approved of a new ministry under the premiership of the Marquis de Armijo, in which Gen. Weyler resumes his old post of minister of war. The populace of Madrid is greatly excited over the cabinet crisis. Anticlerical manifestations continued throughout the night and the police were compelled to charge the crowds. Many persons were injured, among them the grand vicar of the bishop of Madrid, who was hit by a stone. About. 2,000 women of the aristoc racy, headed by the duchess de Balien, have petitioned the king against the law of associations. If the Armijo cabinet is able to satisfy parliament with the ministerial declar ation, an attempt, will be made to hurry through the ratification of the Algeciras convention and the budget and then prerogue the cort.es.

HIRED NEGRO TO KILL NEIGHBOR'S CHILDREN Sons and Colored Man Carried Out Plot—Minister Didn't See Killing —Tragedy Due to Line-Fence Feud. Valdosta, G:i., Der. 5.—J. G. Rawlins and Alf Moore, a negro, were hanged here Tuesday morning for the murder of Willie and Carrie Carter in July, 1905. Both stepped upon the scaffold without a tremor, they stood on the trap together and fell together. Raw lins. in his last statement, declared that he had told the truth and that his sons had no connection with the crime. Moore also declared that, he had told the truth, again insisting that Milton Rawlins had fired the fatal shots. Mrs. Rawlins and her two daughters visited the husband and father during the morning. They re mained in the jail but, did not witness the execution. Trouble Result of Dispute. The crime for which Rawlins and Moore suffered the death penalty pre sented unusual features. Rawlins and W. L. Carter were neighbors 12 miles from here. Both were Baptist, minis ters. Several years ago a dispute arose as to the line between their re spective farms. Litigation and bad blood resulted. Carter was wounded by a shot from ambush, and had Raw lins arrested on the charge of attempt ed murder. A few days later, on June IS, 1905, a night attack was made on the Carter home. Two of the chil dren, Willie and Carrie Carter, were shot while just outside the house, and shots were fired without effect at Car ter and his wife and another daughter. The wounded boy informed his pa rents that. Milton and Jesse Rawlins had shot him. He died the next day. After shooting the children the at tacking party attempted to Bet fire to the house, but were fired upon and driven off without further casualties. A coroner's jury found the crime had been committed by Milton and Jesse Rawlins and A. Moore, a negro. The latter confessed, telling of a plot which had been planned by the elder Rawlings for the murder of the entire Carter family and the burning of their house. J. G. Rawlins, the elder, took no im mediate part in the crime, having gone to Valdosta to avert suspicion. The trial, which lasted two weeks, re sulted in a verdict of death fat the elder Ratlins, his sons, Milton and atitf AJi Moore. Life Sentence tor Third Son. A third son, Leonard Rawlins, was given a life sentence as an accomplice. Then hegan a fight for life. Every legal expedient, has been resorted to, causing the day of execution to be postponed from time to time as each successive temporary advantage was gained by the defense. The ease went to a higher court, then to the supreme court of the United States, then t.o the state su preme court on an extraordinary mo tion, and then to the board of pardons. The verdict below has been sustained In each instance. Governor Terrell's refusal on Monday to interfere with the execution of the death sentence destroyed the men's last hope. The cases of the two Rawlins boys, who are under sentence t.o be hanged Friday, will come before the board of pardons Thursday. No New Trial* for Banker. Cincinnati.

'& 1 FOR BOBBLE CillE UIOIILIESSICE PRESIDENT'S COMMUNICATION IS READ IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. BILL TO OUST ALL NEGROES FROM ARMY Representative Slayden, of Texas, Would Purge Nation's Fighting Force of What He Declares Is a "Dangerous Element." Washington, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's annual message to con gress occupied the attention of the senate ar, soon as the opening pre liminaries were concluded Tuesday. These included the receipt, of mes sages from the house reciting deaths of several of its members. The committee appointed to notify the president that congress was in session made its report through Sen ator Hale of Maine. The reading of the message began at. 12:11 o'clock. Many senators were in their seats and the message received careful at tention. Baron Rosen, the Rtisslan ambassador, accompanied by two members of his embassy staff, occu pied the diplomatic gallery during the reading of the message. House Hears Message. Following the reading of the jour nal in the house the committee ap pointed by the speaker Monday to join a. like committee from the sen ate to wait upon the president re ported that, they had performed that, service and that, he would communi cate in writing to the congress. The house after visiting for a few min utes on motion of Mr. Payne of New York, took a recess for 15 minutes. Close and careful attention was accorded the reading of the presi dent's message by the members of the house. The galleries also showed great interest, iu the document. The president's views on the inherit ance and income taxes pleased the Democrats, Representative Champ Clark of Missouri, expressing the sentiment that the "president liad stolen, taken away and converted to his own use another plank of the Democrats." Serious consideration was given to that, portion of the mes sage relating to the Japanese ques tion. The reading of the message was concluded at 2:50 p. m., and five min utes later the house adjourned until 12 o'clock Wednesday. Ready to Tell 8enate. President. Roosevelt: made it appar ent to his senatorial callers during the day that, he Is anxious for speedy action on a congressional resolution calling for information regarding the discharge of negro soldiers of the Twenty-fifth infantry for participat ing in the riot at Brownsville. As soon as a. resolution is passed he told them, he will send the information to the senate. The president, further stated that either the Penrose or the Foraker resolution will be acceptable to him. Would Oust Negroes from Army. Representative Slayden, of Texas, introduced a. hill which provides that "on or before the 30th day of June. 1907, all enlisted men of the army who are negroes or of negro descent shall be discharged from the service of the United States and thereafter no negro or person of negro descent, shall be en listed or appointed in the army of the United States." In explaining his bill Mr. Slayden said: "The hill speaks for itself. It was not introduced for buncombe. My pur pose is to give the congress of the United States an opportunity to purge the army of an admittedly dangerous element. To say that, the negroes are brave is not. an argument, against, this measure. Many men have been brave, in fact, most men are in the matter of fighting. The Comanche and Sioux Indians were as brave as men can he. But no one would seriously suggest that, we ultimately recruit, regiments from them, put. guns in their hands and station them near companies of white troops, toward whom l.hey entertain inherent race hostility. The Twenty fifth infantry is manifestly imbued with the same race, hostility and events have shown it to be quite as dangerous as the Sioux or Comanche would be." Cousin* Given Hitt's Position. Speaker Cannon announced the pro motion of Representative Robert O. Cousins to the chairmanship of the house committee on foreign affairs, made vacant by the death of Repre sentative Robert R. Hitt, of Illinois. Representative Frank O. Lowden, of Illinois, has been appointed to the committee on foreign affairs to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Hitt's deatb. Shipments of Wild Game Seized.

After cabi net meetings he was wont to slip out by the door which opened into the li brary. a, large oval room directly above the blue parlor. If the room wag not occupied, the secretary would seat, himself at the piano, and soon be engrossed in play ing classical pieces or improvising lovely airs.
