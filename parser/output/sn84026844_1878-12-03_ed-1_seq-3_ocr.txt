An Instructive and Interesting Summary of Facts and Recommendations In Regard to the Domestio and Foreign In terests of the Country. A <iMTrf.il View of Onr Xntlonnl A flair*. folloiD-Citiunu of the Senate and House of , Jlepretenlatives: Our heartfelt gratitude is duo to the Di vine Being who holds in His hands the destinies of nations for the continued be stowal during tho last year of countless blessings upon our country. Wo are at peace with all other nations. Our public credit hasgreatly improved, and is, perhaps, now stronger than over before. Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors of those who till the soil, our manu facturing industries are reviving, and it is believed that general prosperity, which lias byen so long anxiously looked for, is at last witlun our reach. The enjoyment of health by our people generally has, however, been interrupted, during the past season, by the prevalence of a fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some portions of tho Southern States, cre ating an emergency which calleu for prompt and extraordinary measures of "re lief. The disease appeared as an epidemic at Now Orleans anu at other places on tho lower Mississippi, soon after midsummer. It was rapidly spread by fugitives from the infected cities and towns, and did riot disappear until early in November. The States of Louisiana, Mississippi and Ten nessee have suffered^severely. About one hundred thousand cases are Relieved to lmvo occurred, of which about twenty thousand according tointelligentestimates, proved fatal. It is impossible to estimate with any approach to accuracy tho loss to the country occasioned by this epidemic. It is to he reckoned by tho hundred mill ions of dollars. The suffering and desti tution that resulted, excited tho deepest sympathy in all parts of the Union. Phy sicians and nurses hastened from every quarter to tho assistance of tho afllicted communities. Voluntary contributions of money andsupplies, in every needed form, were speedily and generously fur nished. The Government was able to respond in some measuro to tho call for help, by providing tonts, medi cines, and food for the sick and destitute, llto requisite directions for tho purpose be ing given, in tho confident expectation that this action of the Executive would re ceive tho santion of Congress. About eighteen hundred tents, and rations of tho value of about twenty-five thousand dol lars. word sent to. cities and towns which applied for them, full details of which will bo furnished to Congress by tho proper Department. Tho fearful spread of this pestilonce has awakened a very general public sentiment in favor of national sanitary administra tion, which shall not only control quaran tine, hut havo the sanitary supervision of internal commerce in times of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the State and municipal health authorities, \yitli j>ower~to deal with whatovor ondangcrs the public health, and which tho munici pal and State authorities aro unable to regulate. Tho national quarantine act, ap proved April 29, 1878, which was passed too lato in the last session of Con gress to provide tho means for carrying it into practical operation, during tho past season, is a step nri tho direction here in dicated. Jn viow of tho necessity for the most effeciivo measures, by quarantine and otherwise, for tho protection of our seaports, and the country generally, from tJUs and other epidemics, it is recommend ed that CongresHgivo to tlio wholo subject early and careful consideration. THE SOUTHERN OUTRAGES. The permanent piuaficntion of tlio coun try By tlio complete protection of all citi zens in ' oVery civil and political right con tinues to be of paramount interest with the great body of our neoplo. Kvery step in this direction is welcomed with public approval, and every inUirrtiption of steady anil uniform progress to tlio desired con summation awakens general uneasiness ami wide-spread condemnation. There jcentCongre^ionnl elections liavo furnished a direct;and trustworthy test of the ad vance tmis far'rtindo In tho practical es tablishment of the rijjht of suffrage, se cured by tlio Constitution to the liberated I raco in the Southern States. All disturb I ing influences, real or imaginary, had been [ removed from all of these States, i Tho_threo constitutional amendments, whichjconferrod freedom and equality 01 1 civil and political rights upon tlio colored people of the Mouth, wero adopted bv the concurrent action of the great bodv of good citizens who maintained tho authori ty of tho National (lovernment and tlio integrity and perpetuity of the Union at such^R cost of trcasuro and life, as a wise and necessary embodiment in the or ganic law of tho fust results of-tiao war. Tho people of the former slave nelding States accepted theso re sults, and gave, in every practicable fonn, assuranees.that tho thirteenth, four teenth and fifteenth amendments, and laws passed in pursuanco thereof, should, in good faith, be enforced, rigidly and im partinlly.in letter and spirit, totfioond that tho humblest citizen, without distinction of race, or .cpJor,, should, undor them, re ceive full aod equal nroteetion in|per?on and property and in political rights and p'rivi- 1 leges. By theso Constitutional amendments 1 tho Southern section of tho Union ob-! tained a largo increauiof political powerin Congress and in tho Kleetorsl College, and tho country justly expected thai elections would proceed,as to the enfrancblsedracc, upon tho samo clrcmnstenecs of legal and constitutional freedom and protection which obtained in all the other .States of tlio Union. Tho friends of iaw aod order Joo k ed :f3rwartl to tho conduct of those elections, as offering to U10 general judg ment of the-country on important ot> portunity to meastiro tho degree in whichi the right of suffrage couid.i* oxercised by the co/ored people, and would bo resjKJcteil by their follow-cltizens; but a moro general" enjoyment of froedom of suffnuro. by the colored peo]>te, and a more jhat'ttHd iwneroua protection of l^jat freedom by... the communities, of which they form a "part, wero generally antici pated than tho record of the elections dis closes. in so mo of those States in whfrh tho colored pconle have been unable to make tholr opinions felt in tlio elections,' tho Vemiltls" mainly duo to influences not easily measured or romodied by legal pro tection; but in tho States of Louisiana and South Carolina at latro, and in sgme per ticular Congressional dfbtrfcts" outside' of thoso States, tho records of tho elections seem to compel tho conclusion that the rightsof thq colored votenu havq been ovurriddon, and thoir participation in tho' elections not permitted to bo either general or trw, TJIP. PBHIDBXT WILL ENFORCE THE LAW'S. It "will bo for theCongreas for which these elections were held, to make such exami nation! into their conduct as may be ap propriate to determine the validity of the claims of members to their seats. In the meanwhile it becomes the duty of the Ex ecutive and Judicial Departments of the Government, each in its province, to in quire* into and punish violations of the laws of the United States which have oc curred. I can but repeat what I said in thin connection in my last message, that whatever authority rests witu me to this end I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the leg islatures, the courts, the executive authori ties, and the people of the States where these wrongs have been perpetrated, to give their assistance towards bringing to justice the offenders, and preventing ^re petition of the crimes. No moans witnin my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair investigation of the alleged crimes and to secure the conviction and just pun ishment of the guilty. It is to bo observed that the principal appropriation made for the Department of Justice at the lust session contained tho following clause: "And for defraying the expenses which may be incurred in the enforcement of the act approved February twenty-eight, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, entitled 'An act to amend an act approved May thirteenth, eighteen hundred andseventy,entitled An act to en force the rights of citizens of tho United States to vote in the several States of the I I Union, and for other purposes,'or any acts1 I amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." It is the opinion of tho Attorney Gener al that the expenses of Ihese proceedings will largely exceed the amount which was thus provided, and I rely confidently on Congress to make adequate appropriations to enable tho Executive Department to en force the laws. FREE SPEECH, FREE PRESS A.VI) FREE, SUF FRAGE. I respectfully urge upon voiir attention that the Congressional elections, in e\er> dUtrict, in a verv important sense, are justly a matter of political ??oncem throughout the whole country, kncli Stale, every political parly, is en titled to the share of power which is con (erred by the legal and constitutional suf rage. It is the right of every attain, possessing the .Li.al_iflcatlo.lB l>r?cr,bc( . law. to cost one unintiinidatod ballot, ami ;o have his ballot honestly counted. So long as the exorcise of this power and the jnjovment of Ibis riglitaro c0,n1"0111"',1' Kiua'i, practically as well as formally, ?ub mssion to the results of the "u ^e *v' ijo accorded loyally and eheerfullj, an ill tlio departments of Government will eel the true vigor of the popul^ vv inhus jxnressed. No temporary or adininistru ivo interests of Government, however ur >ent or weighty, will ever displace thozeal 'if our people in dofonso of the primary I'ghte if iitizenship. They understand hat the protection of liberty requires tlio iiaiuteiiancc, in full vigor, of tlio manly netliods of free speech, free ureas, and ree suffrage, nnd will sustain tlio full mi hority of Government to cnforco tlio laws A'liich are framed to preserve these icesti iiable rights. The material progress and ivelfaro of the States depend ontho pro ;ection afforded to their caucus. There ?an be no peace witliout bucIi protection, prosperity without -peace, and 1 e n-holo country is deeply into1,1 tho !r^,?,i:ll3^^otyor^he,i joinplcto unity of feeling and recijmHMl :onlulonco between the communiUM ho Intel v and ho seriously estranged, 1 feci an ibsolute assurance that the tendencies are 11 that direction, and with increasing torce. The power ol public opinion wi override all political prejudices, and all ?eetlonal or Stale attachments, in demand ing that nil over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the Unit hI States shall mean one and the same thing, and earry with them unchallenged security and respect. OL*n FOREIGN KEl.ATIONS. Our relations with other countrira con anifbiscfc&ful. Our neutrality in contests between foreign powers has been main tained and respected. Tho Universal Exposition held at Paris during the past summer lias boon attended by a- large number of our citizens. Tho brief period allowed for the preparation and arrange ment of tho contributions of our citizens to this great Exposition was well employ ed in energetic and judicious ellorts to overcome this disadvantage. /hesc elTorts, led and directed bv the Commissioner. General, were remarkably succt^ful. and the exhibition of tho products of. Ameri can industry was creditable and gratifying Kpeand character. The reports of the United States commissionoffl, giving its csulu.il deuil, Will be dulv laid before you. Our participation in this udornR tional competition for tlio favor and the trade of tho world may be oxpected to produce useful and important results, in promoting intercourse, friendship, and commerce with other nations. UOIiO AND SILVElt* In accordance with tho provisions of the act of February 28, 187S, three cprnmis Hioners were api>oInted to an international eonforente on tho subject of ?dopluit,*a oonunon ratio between gold and siUerJor the purpose of establishing, i^tornaUonal lv tlio use of bimetallic money, and secur ing ilxlty of relative value between tlio?o "invitations were niMrcssodtolbc var ious Governments which had Mpressed ? willintmess to participate m its delibera UonH.

No common ratio between gold and silver could be agrjjjJj upon by tho conference e ff-J conclusion was reached that it is necessary to maintain in tlio w or u the monetary functions of silver as Wll m of gold, leaving the selee lio of the use of one or tlio other of theso t'vo metals, or of both, to b? made readily the if after correspondence with tho British ho Kdent Shall doom it hi? duty in make the pavment, communications '"ft* ;r ,as '"^SpiiurofenV has oflij ?& ottS Ifelsrfes 0rTh0entreaty made with Italy> reeioroal consular privileges, lias ix.en duly rutltW Slid proclaimed- .

Japan, after a long neriod of seclusion, has within the past few years made rapid strides in the path of en lightenment and progress, and not un reasonably is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilated to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to this end has been made, which will be submitted for the con sideration of the Senate. After an interval of several years, the Chinese Government has again sent en voys to the United States. They have been received, and a permanent legation is now established here by that Government. I It is not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friendly relations and removing causes of difference. The treatv with'the Samoan Islands, having been duly ratified and ac cepted on the part of both Governments, is now in operation, and a survey and soundings oi the harbor of Pago-Pago have boon inhde by a naval vessel of the United*States, with a view of its occu pation as a naval station, if found desira ble to the service. Since'the resumption of diplomatic rela tions with Mexico, correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two Governments upon the various questions which at one time seemed to en danger their relations. While no formal! agreement lias been reached, as to the troubles on the border, much has been I done to repress and diminish thein. The effective force of United States troops on the Rio Grande, by n strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has dono much to remove the sources of dis pute, and it is now understood that a like force of Mexican troops on tlio other side of tho river is also making an energetic movement against tho marauding Indian tribes. This Government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every evidence of strength in the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to puuisli incursions upon our territory. Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in. the control of these incur sions, by military movements across the border, not imperatively demanded for tho protection of tho lives and property of our own citizens, I shall take tho earliest op portunity, consistent with tho propor dis charge of this plain duty, to recognize the ability of the Mexican Government to re strain effectively violations of our territo ry. It is proposed to hold next year an International Exhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the display of the agricultu ral and manufacturing products 01 tho two nations will tend to better understanding and increased commercial intercourse be tween their people. . ? ? With Brazil, ami the Republics of Cen tral and South America, some steps have been taken toward the development of closer commercial intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Colom bia and with Bolivia. A boundary ques tion between the Argentine Republic and Paraguay has been submitted by those Governments for arbitration to the Presi dent of tho United States, and I have, af ter careful examination, given a decision upon it A naval expedition up the Amazon and Madeira rivers has brought back informa tion valnablo both for scientific and com mercial Ipurposcs. A like expedition is al>out visiting tho coast of Africa and the Indian ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers in relation to tho de velopment of our foreign commerce have furnished many facts that have proved of public interest, and have stimulated to practical exertion tho enterprise of our people. THE GOVERNMENT FINANCES. The report of the Secretary of tho Treasury furnishes a dotailcd statement of the operations of that Department of tho Government, and of tho condition of the public finances. Tho ordinary revenues from all sources for tlio fiscal year ended June 150th, 1878, wero $257,703,878 70; tho ordinary ex penditures for the same period, were $230,004,320 80?leaving a surplus revenue for tho year, of $20,700,651 00. The receipts for the present fiscal year, ending June 30th, 1870, actual and esti mated, are as follows: Actual receipts for tho first quarter commencing July 1st, 1878, $73,389,743 43; estimated receipts for the remaining three-quarters of tho year, $101,110,250 57: total receipts tor the current fiscal vear, act ual and estimated, $204,500,000. The expenditures for tho same period will be, actual and estimated, as follows: _For the quartor commencing July 1, 1878, actual expenditures $73,344,573 27; and for tho remaining three-quarters of tho vear,_tne exi>enditures are estimated at *100,755, 420 73?making tho total* expenditures, $240,100,000; and leaving an estimated sur plus revenue, for tho year ending June30, 1870, of $24,400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated ac cording to existing laws, will bo $204,500^ 000; ami the estimated ordinary expendi tures, for the same period, will bo $2M, 320,41208; leaving a surplus of $28,170, 587 32 for that year. In the foregoing statements of expendi tures, actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for tlio sinking-fund provided for bv tlio act approved February 25, 1802, which requires .that one per (rent of the entire debt of the Unitod Suites shall bo purchased or paid within each fiscal year, to bo set apart as a sinking-fund. There has ]>cen, however, a substan tial compliance with tho conditions of tho law. lly its terms tho public dobt should lmve been reduced between 1802 and the close of tho last fiscal year$518,30l,800 28: tho actual reduction of the ascertained dobt in that period 1ms been $720,044, 730 01. being in excess of tho reduction re quired by tlio sinking fund act, $202,282, 033'33. ? The amount of tho publicdebt, less cash in tho treasury, November 1,1878.was $2, 024,200,08318,'a reduction since tho saino i date last year of $23,150,017 3D. Tho progress made during tho last year | in refunding tho public dobt at lower rates of interest 5 very, gratifying. The amount I of four per cent bonds sold during tho present vear prior to November 23.1878,1 is $100,270,000, and six per cent bonds commonly known as five-twenties, to an equal amount, have been, or will bo re deemed as calls mature. It has beeu tho policy of tho Depart ment to place tho four per cent bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desired to" invest his savings, whether small or great, in theso securities. Tho Secretary of the Treasury recommends that the law be so modified," that small sums may bo invested, and that throuch the iMjstolliccs. or other agents of tlio Government, the freest opportunity may , bo ffivon in all parts of tho country for such investments. Tho best modo suggested Is, that tho Department be authorized to issue certifi cates of deposit, of tho denomination of ten dollars, bearing Interest at tho rato of 3.05 per cont per annum and convertible at any tiine within one year after their is iguoiuto tlio four per ount bond authorjz 0*1 by tho refunding act, and to bo .issued only in oxrhango for Inital States notes sent to tho Treasury by mail or otherwise. Such a provision of law. supported by sultablo regulations, would enaol.e finy person readily, without cost or ?" r-' 1 *?:?, m/inntf Jnfn on mlorest tlio money Bu rutuneu yyu... rr to thp redemption of nix per cont bonds. Tlio coinage 61 gold during tho lust fiscal yekr was$57,708M: Thp (oinogo of sil ver dollars, under tlio act passed February gS, J 87$, amounted on tho'.'d of November, 1*7$, to

With views unchanged with regard io tho wt un4?r which the coinage of silvor proceeds, )t has beeu tho purpose of tlio Secretary faithfully to execute tlio law, and to afford a fair trial of tho measure. In til# present financial condition of tho country, Jan) porsmded that the wolfare of legitimate buainosa and industry of ev ery doscription .will bo best promoted by abstaining from all attempt! to make radi cal changes in the existing financial lesU lation. Let it bo uudentood that during the coming year the business of the coon try will be undisturbed by governmental interference with tbe laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect that the re sumption of specie payments, which will take place at the appointed time, will be successfully and easily maintained, and that it will be followea by a healthful and enduring revival of business prosperity. ' Let the healing .influences of tune, the inherent energies of our people, and the boundles resourcess of our country, have a fair opportunity, and relief from pregent difficulties will surely follow. TUB WAR DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of War shows that the army has been well and economically supplied, that our small force has been actively employed, and has faith fully performed all the service required of it. The morale of the army has improved, and the number of desertions has materi ally decreased during the year, the Secretary recommends? 1. That a pension be granted to "the widow of the late Lieutenant Henry H. lien nor, 18th Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever while in command of the steamer "J. M. Chambers," sent with sup f>lies for the reliof of sufferers in the South rom that disease. 2. The establishment of tho annuity scheme for the benefit of the heirs of de ceased oflicers, as suggested by |he Pay master General. , 3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for tho publication of the records of the War of the Rebellion, now being prepared for that purposo. 4. Tho increase of tho oxtra per diem of soldier-teachers employed in post-schools, and liberal appropriations for the erection of buildings for schools and libraries at the different posts. 5. Tho repeal or amendment of tho act of Juno 18,1878, forbidding the "use of the army as a pone comitatiu, or otherwise, for I the purpose of executing tho laws, except in such cases and under such circuinstan-1 ces as may be expressly authorized by the Constitution or by act of Congress." 0. Tho passago of a joint resolution of Congress legalizing the issues of rations, tents, and medicines which wero made for tho relief of sufferers from yellow fover. 7. That provision be made for the eroc tion of a lire-proof building /or the pres ervation of certain valuable records, now constantly exposed to destruction By lire. These "recommendations are all com mondftd In- vour favorable consideration. , THE NAVY* The report of tlio .Secretary of tlio Xavv shows that tho navy lias improved .luring tlio lost fiscal J oar.

IDSTOKKICK DEPARTMENT. Tho report of tho Postmastor General cmbracos a detailed statemont of the oper ations of tho Postofllco Department. The expenditures of tljat Department for the fiscal year onded Juno 30, 1878, were $34,105,084 49. The receipts, in cluding gales of stamps, money-or der business, and official stamps, wero $29,277,510 95. The sum of $290,436 00, included in tho foregoing statement of exjKmditures, is chargoablo to preceding yoars, so that tho actual ox ponditurcs for tho fiscal year ended Juno W, 18,8, are SKI,874,(>47 50. Tho amount drawn from tho Treasury on appropria tions, m addition to tho rovenues of tho Department, was $5,307,052 82. Tho ox ?rtiXrC8 for!.,1? y?ar ending Juno .10,1880, aro estimated at $30,571,900, and tho roceipts from all sources at $30,004, 0215 90, leaving adoflciencv to be appro pnatcd out the Treasury of $5,907,870 10. Th? report calls attention to tho fact that the compensation of postmasters and of railroads forearming the mail is regulated hy law, and that the failure of Congress to appropriate tho amounts required for these purposes does not relieve the fiovormnent of responsibility, but necessarily increases the deficiency bills which Congress will be called upon to puss. In providing for tho postal service, tho following questions aro presented: Should Congress annually appropriate a sum for its expenses nrgely in excess of its reve nues, orshould such rates of postage bo es tablished as will moke tho Department self: sustaining? Should the postal service-bo reduced by excluding from tho malls, mat ter which does not pay its way? Should the number of post routes be diminished? should othor methods bo adopted which will increase the rcvoniios or diminish tho expenses of the postal scrvlco? The International Postal Congress, which mot at 1 uris May 1,1878, and continued in session until Juno 4 of tho same year, was composed of delegates from nearlvall the civilized countries of the world.

V\fheir in'" J J i V 0 of the Indians peaceful, two local disturbance have oc ? curred, which were deplorable in thei; character, but remained, happily, con fined to a comparatively small number o Indians. The discontent among the Ban nocks, which led flrwt to some actaofvio lence on the part of some members of the tribe and finally to the outbreak, appear* to have been caused by an insufficiency ol food on the reservation, and this in sufficiency to have been owing tc the inadequacy of the appropriations, made by Congress, to the wants of the Indians, at a time when the Indians were prevented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. After* an arduous pursuit by the troops of the United States and several engagements, the hostile Indians were reduced to sub jection, and the larger part of them sur rendered themselves as prisoners. In this connection I desire to call attention to the recommendation made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of the Executive, to ue used with proper accountability at discretion, in sudden emergencies of" the Indiun service. The other causeof disturbance was that of a band of Northern Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reservatson in the Indian Territory .and marched rapidly through the States of Kansas and Nebras ka, in the direction of their old hunting grounds, committing mnrders and oth er1 crimes on their way. From doc uments accompanying tuo report of the Secretary of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly bund was as fully suit plied with the necessaries of life as the four thousaud seven hundred othor In dians who remained quietly on the reser vation, and that the disturbance was caused by men of a restless and mischiev ous disposition among the Indians them selves. Almost the whole of this band have surrendered to the military authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that, when some of them had taken refuge in the camp of the Red Cloud Sioux, with whom they had been in friendly relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners and readily gave them up to the officers of the United States, thus I giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the contrary notwith standing, they have uniformly shown ever since the wishes they expressed at the council of Soptember, 1877, had been com plied with. .Both the Secretary of the Interior and tlie Secretary of War unite in the recom mendation that provision bo made by Con gress for the organization of a corps of I mountod "Indian auxiliaries," to bo un-l der the control of the army, anil to boused for tho purpose of keeping* the I ndians 011 their reservations and preventing or re pressing -disturbance on their part. I earnestly concur in this recommendation. It is believed that the organization of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a mod erate pay from tho Government, would considerably weaken the restless element among the "Indians by withdrawing from it a number of young men and giving them congenial employment under the Govomment, it being ii matter of expe rience that Indians in our service almost without exception are faithful in the per formance of the duties assigned to them. Such an organization would materially aid the army in the accomplishment of a task for which its numerical strengh is somo-1 times found insufficient. Hut, while the .employment of force for the prevention or repression of Indian troubles is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end, greater reliance must be placed on humane and civilizing agencies for the ullimate so lution of what is called the Indian prob lem. It may bo very diflieult, and require much patient effort, to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian to the restraints of civilized life, but experience allows that it is not impossible. Many of the tribes whiclj arc now quiet and.ordorly and self supporting woro onco as savage as any that at present roam over the plains or in the mountains of the far west, and were then considered inaccessible to civilizing influ ences. It may bo impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the white popula tion of the United States; but wo should not forgot that they are the aborigines of the country, ami called the sod their own on 'which our people lmvo grown rich, powerful, and happy. Wo owe it to thorn, as a moral duty to help thorn in attaining at least that de gree of civilization which they may be able to reach. It is not only our duty?it is also our interest to do so. Indians who have becomo agriculturists or herdsmen, and feel an intorest in property, will thonce forth eeaso to bo a warliko and disturbing clement. It is also a woll-authenticatcd fact that Indians are apt to bo peaceable and quiet whon their children are at school, and I am gratified to know, from the ex pressions of Indians themselves and" from many concurring reports, that there is a steadily increasing desire, even among In dians belonging to comparatively wild tribes, to have their children educated. I invite attention to the reports of the Sec retary of the Interior and tho Commission er of'Indian Affairs, touching tho experi ment recently inaugurated, in taking fifty Indian children, boys and girls, from differ ent tribes, to tho llampton Normal Agri cultural Institute, in Virginia, where thoy arc to recoive an elemontnry KngUsh edu cation and training in agriculture and oth er useful work, to bo returned to their tribes, after tho completed course, as in terpreters, instructors, aud examples. It is reported that tho oflicer charged with tho selection of those children might have had thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possiulo to mako provi sion for them. I agree with the Secretary of the lntorior in saying that "the result of this interesting experiment, if favorable, may bo destined to becomo an important factor in tho advancement of civilization among tho Indians." Tho question, whether a chango in tho control of the Indian service should be made, was, at the laxt sosslon of Congress, reforred to a eommittoo for inquiry and report. "Without desiring to anticlpute that report, 1 venture to express the hope that in tho decision of so im portant a question, tho views express ed nbovo may not bo lost sight of, and that tho decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a dis turbing effect upon the service as well as on tho Indians themselves. HOT 

SPRIKG8, In tho onrolment of the bill making ap propriations for sundry civil expenses, at the last session of Congress} that portion which provided for the continuation of the 1 lot Springs Commission was omitted. As the Commission had completed tho work of taking testimony on tho many conflict ing claims, tho suspension of tlieir labors before determining tho rights of claimants; threatened, for a time, to embarrass the interests, not only of tho Government, j but also of a largo number of tho citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for final action on tlieir claims before beginning contemplated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended, and at tho solicita tion of many leading citiiizcns of Hot Springs, ana others interested in the welfare of tho town, tho Secretary of tho lntorior was authorized to request tho lato commissioners to tako charge of the records or their proceedings, and to per form such work as could properly be done i by them under such circumstances, to fa , cflitate the future adjydioatlon of tho , claims at an early day, and to presorve the status of tho claimants until their rights should be finally determined. The late . commissioners complied with that request i anil report that the testimony, in all tho cases has been written out, examined, i briefed and HQ arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law, , It is recommended that tho requisite nu I thority bo given at as early a day in tho session as possible, and that a fair com . satlon be allowed the lato commissioners ' for tho expense incurred and tho labor ^ jwrformed by them since the 25th of June f I invito tho attention of Congress to tho ? recommendations mado by tho Secretary ? of the Interior with regard to the prescr ? vation of the timbor on tho public lands ? of the United States. Tho protection of , the public property is one of the first du ? tics of the Government. The.Department I of the lntorior should, therefore, boena ? bled by rofflciept appropriations, to enforce r the laws in that respect. But this; ? matter appears still more important f as a question of public economy. The - rapid destruction of our forests is an evil ? fraught with the gravest consequences, > especially in the mountainous districts. ? where the rocky slopes, once denuded 01 f their trees, will remain so forever. There ? the injur>', once done, cannot be repaired, i I fully concur with the Secretary of the , Interior in the opinion that,for this reason, i legislation touching the public timber in i -the mountaionus States and Territories of ; tho West, should bo especially well con sidered, and that existing laws, in which i tho destruction of the forests is not sufll ciently guarded against, should be speedi ly modified. A general"!law concern ing this important subject, appears to mo to be a matter of urgent public necessity. TIIK IMPORTANCE OP OUB AOB1 CULTURAL IN TKBBST8. From the organization of the Govern ment, the importance of encouraging by all possible irieans, the increase of our ag-1 ricultural productions has been acknowl edged and urged upon the attention of Congress and the people as the surest and readiest means of increasing our sub stantial and enduring prosperity. The words of Washington are as applica ble to-day as when, in his eighth annual message. lie said: "It is not to bo doubted that with reference to either individual or national welfare, ngriculturo is of primary importance. In proportion as nations ad vance in population and other cir cumstances of maturity, this truth be comes more apparent and renders the cultivation of tho soil moro an object of public patronage. Institutions for pro moting it grow up, supported by the public puree, and to what object can it bo dedicated with greater propriety? -Among tho means whicn have been employed to this end none have boen attondou with greater success than the establisninent of 1 boards composed of proper characters, I charged with collecting and diffusing in formation, and enabled, by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to oncourago and as sist tho spirit of discoverj* and improve ment, this species ef establishment con tributing doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulating to en terprise nnd experiment, and by draw ing to a common centre the results every where of individual skill and observation, and spreadinglhein thence over tho whole uatiou. ^Experience accordingly hath shown that tliey are very cheap instru ments of immense national benefty." Tho great preponderance of tho agricul tural, over any other interest in tho United States entitles it to all the consideration claimed for it by Washington. About one half of the population of the United States is engaged in agriculture. Tho value of tho agricultural products of the United States for the year 1878, is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. Tho exports of agricultu ral products for tho year 1877, as appears from the re port of tho Bureau of Statistics, wero live hundred and twenty-four millions of dol lurs. Tho great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, en ables us to produce within our own bor ders, and by our own labor, not only the necessaries but most of the luxuries that are consumed in civilized countries. Yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate, and intercommunication, it ap pears from the statistical statements in the report of tho Commissioner of Agriculturo, that wo import annually from foreign lands many millions of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could, be raised in our own country. Numerous questions ariso in tho prac tice of advanced agriculture which can only bo answered by experiments, often costly and sometimes fruitless, which arc beyond the means of privato individuals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of tho nation. It is fjood j>olicy, especially in times of de pression and uncertainty mothor business pursuits, with a vast area of uncultivated, and hence unproductive territory, wisely opened to homestoad settlemeht,to encour age,by every proper and legitimate means, tho occupation and tillage of tho soil. Tho offorte of tho Department of Agriculture to stimulate old and introduce new agricul tural industries, to improve tho quality and increase tho Quantity of our products, to determine the valuo of old or establish the importance of now methods of culture, arc worthy of your careful and favorable consider ation, and assistance by suph appropriations of money and enlargement of facilities a* may seem to be demanded by tho present favorablo conditions for the growth and rapid develop ment of this important interest. The abuse of animals in transit is widely at tracting public attention. A national con vention of societies specially interested in the subject has recently met at Baltimore, and tho facts developed, both in regard to crueltiea to animals and the effect of auch cruelties upon tho public healtli, would seem to demand the caroful consideration of Congress, and the en aotment of more efficient laws for the prevcn< tion of these abuses. # THE HtrnEAU OF
