MALLRAX. .Editor The President's Message. the 47th The last session of congress met at eleven o'clock on the 4th inst. The presidential message was immediately read. It is a mediocre document, feeble in tone and negative in effect, being chiefly icmarkable for what it leaves unsaid. It opens with a view of our foreign relations, gives a brief resume of the financial status of the country, and in reference to the present exorbi tant taxation, and resulting sur plus makes the following excel lent observatiens: "For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1S82, the surplus revenue amounted to $100,000,000. For the fiscal year ending on the 30th of June last the surplus was more than $145,000,000. The report of the secretary shows wiiat disposi tion has been made of these moneys. They have not only answered the requirements of the sinking fund, but have afforded a large balance applicable to other reductions of the public debt. I renew the ex pression of my conviction that such rapid extinguishment of the national indebtedness as now taking place is in no measure a cause of congratulation. It is a cause rather for serious apprehen sion. If it continues it must speedily be followed by one of the civil issues so clearly set forth in the re port of the secretary. Either the surplus must be idle in the treasury or the government will be forced to buy at market rates bonds not redeemable and which, under such circumstances, cannot fail to com mand an enormous premium, or the swollen revenues will be de voted to extravagant expendi ture, which, as experience has taught, is ever the bane of an over flowing treasury." In reference to to future bills for domestic improvement, now generally lumped together under the title of "River and Haibor bill," President Arthur suggests: "Is it not advisable that grants of considerable sums of money for divers independent schemes of international improvement should be made the subject of separate and distinct legislative enactment? It will scarcely be gainsaid, even by those who favor the most liberal expenditures, for such purposes as are sought to be accomplished by what is commonly called the river and harbor bill, that the practice of grouping in such a bill appro priations for a great diversity of objects widely separated, either in their natures or localities, or in both, is one which is- much to be deprecated, unless it is necessary to secure the success of the bill as a whole, though many of the items, if scparateby considered, could scarcely fail of rejection." Talking of cheap postage, he says: "At the last session of congress several bills were introduced in the house of representatives for the reduction of letter postage to two cents per half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subject, and am thoroughly persuaded that such reduction would be for the best interests of the public. It has been the policy of the government from its foun dation to defiay as far as possible the expenses of carrying the mails by a direct tax in the form of post age. It has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be productive as a net revenue. As has been stated already, the report of the postmaster-general shows that there is now a very con siderable surplus in this depatt ment, and that henceforth the re ceipts are likely to increase at a mucb greater rate than the neces sary expenditure unless some change is made in the existing laws, and the profits of the postal service will in a very few years swell the revenue of the govern ment many millions of dollars. The time seems auspicious for some reduction in the rates of postage." The message is below the aver age of state papers and is the poorest production of the kind since Grant's message in 1875. church bells, ho arrested the min isters for working in the pulpit, the choir singers for working in the choir, the ushers for working in the aisles, the street car con ductors, the bakers, the printers, the hotel waiters and cooks, the steamboatmen, every one indis criminately that earned money on the Sabbath. It was amusing the next day to see the general "kick ing." Since then Cincinnati peo ple wickedly work on Sunday when deemed by them necessar' so to do.

Tin: Portland Standard, in a discussion of the admission of cer tain territories, makes the singular assertion that in the case of Utah, "It would be much easier to deal with the institutions of Utah as a state than as a territory." This statement is in direct opposition to the facts. If the Standard is anything at all politically, it is in i favor oi state sovereignty, .inl would bo the first to fall in ihe wake of the 2s cw York World, which has been praising polygamy and excusing its adherents for the last six months. Any community cursed by such a practice as polygamy should never be admit ted to the Union. It is not a question of congressional icpre sentation, but of public morality. A Caiuo despatch of the -JUi says: Arabi Pasha this morning pleaded guilty to the charge of re bellion. In the afternoon the court martial reassembled and pionounccd sentence of death. The khedive commuted the sent ence to exile for life. It is be lieved that Arabi will retire to some part of the British domin ions. His demeanor before the court was very dignified. Other chiefs of the rebellion will be similarly disposed of. It is now reported Arabi will be sent to the Cape of Good Hope. General Commission Herchan t AKTORIA, OIIKGOX. XiU to Oifgnn T!allwa A.
