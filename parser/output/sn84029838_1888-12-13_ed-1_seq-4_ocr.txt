There were -great abases in railroad management Capital, organized and combined in great railroad sjstems, under the con trol of a few men. was. in many instan ces being used illegitimately, and in eoxne instances almost disastrously to the interests of the people. Congress was aware of it, and alter some study of the various railway problems', very short considering their magnitude, framed the interstate commerce law to correct the evils existing. It might have been esp acted that the law would have many defects. To estab lish rules and regulations governing the whole railway mileage of the United States, matters which the combined rail way intelligence of the country had at tempted in one way and another hun dreds of times, and failed, was a task even greater than Herculonean. Time has proven that the law has most serious defecls m many sections. The Inter state commission has gone as far as it has authority, and widely construed the the law in some instances and overlooked its observance in others. There are portions of the law, how ever, which the commission cannot ac cept but in letter and epirit, which weigh most heavily upon the carr'ew, even to the extent of depreciating the value cf their property millions of dollars,, and placing them almost in the hands of receivers. We refer to the long and short haul clause and to the clause en tirely prohibiting pooling. Toe Union has heretofore referred to the liret of the S3 and will say nothing now in regard to it. Fooling in its best form does not pre vent legitimate competition and never did, but it does check cut-throat rail roading which is an injury to the public and to the carriers. Cut-tbroat business is always deliterions, whatever its field. Basmess is never of general and lasting gocd if it is not remunera tive it it does not pay a small profit As matters no stand in railroad affairs, there being no way to maintain fair and reasonable rates, the cut-throat road, the bankrupt road, the road that has no dividends to pay, merely the interest on its bonds, has the great edvantage in the field of competition and is eventually in the position of dictator. There is nothing short of general con solidation to ameliorate the evils of des tructive rate cutting which now menace the railroads of the country, especially the western railroad?, owing to over construction, save pooling, which would be infinitely better than wholesale con solidations, ss there would be much freer competition under pools. Already there has been talk of ooreolidation of all the lines of the southwest, the roads for the time despairing of help from congress. In 1887 20,000 miles of new road were built. It does not make matters better to say that this road was built too soon. It is built and hundreds of millions are wrapped up in it. Money invested in railroads cannot be taken out, and the practical, common senss question which appeals to every man, whether railroad man or not, is, can the country effort to see this new mileage the building of which wes of greater general good, than of advantage to the eorporat'onp, even if it had made operating expenses dreg great rnd powerful and good ronds down with it? That is almost the situation. In the case of the trans continental lines, there is another very aggravating question to contend with, which was not taken into consideration when the law was framed, but which is of very serious character that of water transportation, which competes directly with them in all seaboard business at ruinous rates. Pre vious to the framing of this law this business wss pooled, and by subsidies and other pcol arrangements the rates wore kept eta fair and reasonable figure. By ''fair and rersonable" we mean a fig ure that enabled them to pay operating excenees and n f mill dividend. We believe in government supervision of railroads and that the interstate com rreroe commission has a miesion. It will continue to have one while unjust dis crimination lasts; but there are intrica cies of management, born of rival lines and increasing competition wlich a com miFsion cannot best solve. Despite the clamor to the contrary, sometimes heard, the railroads have done more for the country than they have re ceived. Tbey ought to, and have the right to exist and pay their debtp, and wait while the sections which they serve are growing populons and prosperous. And we earnestly believe that congress should come to the relief of the present situation, which we regret to say is m"st alarming and fraught with the greatest danger, by making pooling in its best forms legitimate. In this we are but voicing the convictions of all public spirted and conservative men, who have given the situation but more than a pnacitKr thought. F. P. Iialxr in'io peka Union. 

IVHAT SHOULD BK BONE. Now that it is on accomplished fact that sugar can profitably be made of sorghum, the nest question to be set tled is, how to utilize this fact for the best interests of the state. It costs a good deal of money to put in a p!ant, and from the shortness of the time, in which sorghum hss to be worked up, the machinery lies idle about three-fourths of the year. During that time the in terest on the cost of the plant goes on. On account of this sugar cannot be made as cheap as it could ba it the ma chinery could be kept at work the year round. How to remedy this is the ques tion. It is certain that money cannot be raised to put in a plant in every neigh borhood. Cannot a remedy for this ba brought about by establishing mills to grind tne cane and make molasses in every place where cane can be bought to keep them running through the cane season. Then let this molasses te shipped to the mills already established and in this manner these could be kept running through the year. We do not know that this is practicable, but if it is, it would make Kansas the great sugar proaocmg state of tne union, what do you say about this, Mr. CowgOlf F. P. Baker in Topeka Union. THE TARIFF IS A TAX." The above was what Mr. Cleveland and the democratic party said, all through the late canvass. If there was anything settled by the election it was that the above statement was not true. The republicans all over the country took the opposite ground, that k that in tbeasda the tariff was not a tax the with perhaps a single cxcepttrjB. One of the republican speakers in this state declared that the tariff wta a tax in some indefinite way. . It was blun der aad a mistake, sad had it been be lieved by the people, Cleveland would have been elected. Even TTsns might .have given him its vote. The people did not believe it aad voted for Harrison. !That the tariff lsws need remodeling is .conceded by every one. But they are to be remodeled by those who believe in protection, end not by those who be lieve in a tariff for revenue onlv. This is what the late election mnp spd this A BULEOAD is conceded by intelligent well as by republiemfc F. P. Baker in Topeka Union.

Topeka Journal: Superintendent Biley, of the city electric light station, has Leea burning crude oil in one of the eDgines. The new plan, which has proven a success by practical testa ev erywhere, is giving satisfaction. The only thing to be determined is whether it will, under the present freight rates on oil, be co more expensive than coaL If not, it will probably supercede coal in not only the city electric plant, but in many of tne larger institutions of the city.

Thy Think it Would bo Better to Give up the Amount Due the Govern ment TbantoTske Postesslon and Operate the Boad. Wasuisotos, D. C, De-ember 4. The sovernment directors of the Union Pacific Railroad company in their annual report to the secretary of the interior, under the date of November 59, say they have assumed as a premise now beyond the scope of discussion the necessity of an adjustment to ths gov ernment and the railroad company for the payment of the funds heretofore advanced aj a subsidy for buildinc the road. The government directors are still of the opin ion that it would be better for the United States to lose every dollar of its debt and execute a release to the company, than to undertake the duties of a common carrier of goods and passengers, thereby establishing a precedent which would surely create mis chief far beyend the bine&ts tole reaped from so hazardous an experiment. It most be clear too, eays tbo report, th&' every year that is allowed to pass without the liquidation and settlement of the debt, increases to a serious extent the difficulties of the situation. The questions between it and the government, the report says, are to be passed upon and determined byalara body of men coming from different part f the country, actuated it may be in somo in stances by an honest prejudice, founded upon an imperfe:t knowledge or distorted repressntatiou of facts; or not unf requently by ths conviction that some punitory meas ure should be adopted against the corpora tion, even at the risk of diminishing its ability to respond. These and other elements of uncertainty embarrass the movements of the company, and paralyze its freedom of action. It is as important to tho government as to the company that all necessary liberty should be given the managers of the corporation to develop the resources upon which the fa tare solvency of the road must depend. It is not possible, the report says, that a rail way company, situated as tho Union Pa cific, shall remain any considerable length of time in the same condition. 4it must move in one direction or the other. It mnst improve or deteriorate. lne government directors assume that some settlement should now bs made and recommend the conclusions of the majority of the commission appointed under the act of 1887 as sound, judicious and practicable. They earnestly hope that they will meet with the approval of congress. By adopt ing these conclusions they are of the opin ion that the government will secure its claim beyond any reasonable risk. Its lien, they assert, will then bo placed in such shaps as to make enforcement possible in case of a default in the payment of interest; and every jear in the future will make ulti mate payment of principal more probable.
