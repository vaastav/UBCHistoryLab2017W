PRESIDENT MATTERS IN NEED OF LEGISLA TION BROUGHT TO ATTEN TION OP CONQKESS, RECOMMENDATIONS MADE ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS Increased Power for Interstate Com merce Favored ns Curo for Hall road Rebate Evil Insurance and Labor Questions. Washington, Dec. 6. In Ids nnnunl mes tape to congress, the president brings sev eral matters to thu attention of the. na tion's lawmakers upon which, In his es timation, legislation Is necessary. Rccom inundations uro mado for new laws nnd mlvlsed In statutes already enacted, made necessary by changed conditions. Tho completo messago Is a document of almost 15,000 words. The only reference made to tariff revision Is In the paragraph devoted to national revenues, whero ho dcclored thut unless our expenditures can bo kept within the u venues, aur revenue laws must bo readjusted. Whut form this readjust ment should take, if It U needed, ho de clures It Is us yet too early to say. Control of Corporations. The president devotes considerable space to the discussion of tho great corporations of tho country, nnd particularly the rail roads'. He believes tho tlmo has come when they should be placed under federal control and recommends legislation look ing to this end. The rollroad rebate evil Is deplored, and he ndvlscs action that would abolish It. Ho believes the present Interstate commerce laws arc Inadequate nnd that If tho commission were endowed with more power It would aid greatly In solving the vexed problem. In this connec tion he says: "It has been a misfortune that the na tional laws on this subject have hitherto been of a negative or prohibitive rather than an affirmative kind, and still more that they have In part sought to prohibit whnt could not bo effectively prohibited, and have In part In their prohibitions con founded what should be allowed nnd what should not be allowed. It Is generally use less to try to prohibit all restraint on com petition, whether this restraint be reason able or unrensonnb.e, and whero It Is not useless It Is generally hiirtrui. lsvcnis havo shown that It Is not possible ade quately to secure tho enforcement of any law of this kind by Incessant appeal to the courts. The department of Justice has for tho last four sears devoted moro attention to the enforcement of the nntttrust legisla tion than to anything else. Much has been accomplished; particularly marked hus been tho moral effect of the prosecu tions; but It Is Increasingly evident that there will bo a very Insulllclent benefi cial result In the way of economic change. The successful prosecution of one device to evade the law Immediately dc-vel'ips an other device to accomplish tho same pur pose. What Is needed Is not sweeping pro bltlon of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend to icstrlct competition, but such adequate supervision and regulation ns will prevent any restriction of compel! tlon from being to tho detriment of the public as well as such supervision nnd reg ulatlon ns will prevent other abuses In no way connected with restriction of compe tltlon. Of these abuses, perhaps tho chief, although by no means the only one, Is over capitalization generally Itself tho result of dishonest promotion because of the myriad evils It brings in its train; for sucn overcapitalization often means nn lnllntlon that Invites business panic; It always con reals tho true relation of tho profit earned to the capital actually Invested, and It creates a burden of Interest payments which Is a fcrtllo cnuse of Improper rcduc tlon In or limitation of wnges; It dnmages tho small Investor, discourages thrift, and encourages gambling nnd speculation; while perhaps worst of nil Is tho trlcklncsa and dishonesty which it implies for harm to morals Is worso than any possible harm to material Interests, nnd the debuuehcry of politics and business by great dishonest corporations is far worse than nny actual material evil they do to tho public. Until tho nntlonal government obtains, In some mnnncr which the wisdom of the congress may suggest, proper control ovct the big corporations engaged in Interstate com mercethat Is, over tho great majority of the big corporations it will bo Impossible to deal adequately with theso evils." Itallroad Itate Regulation. Ho strongly protests ngnlnst radical or hasty action In stopping the rebate evil, nnd then goes on to say: "I do not believe In the government Interfering with private business more than Is necessary. I do not bellevo In the government undertaking any work which can with propriety bo left In private hands, nut neither do 1 believe In tho government flinching from oversee ing any work when It becomes evident that abuses are sure to obtain therein unless there Is governmental supervision. It Is not my province to Indicate tho exact terms of tho law which should be enacted; but I call the attention of tho congress to cor taln existing conditions with which It Is desirable to deal. In my Judgment the most Important -provision which such lav should contnln is that conferring upon homo competent administrative body the power to decide, upon the enso being brought before It, whether a given rate pre scribed by a railroad Is reasonable and Just, and If It Is found to be unreasonable nnd unjust, then after full Investigation of tho complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which It shall not bo lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate, as it Is commonly called this decision to go into effect within a rensonnhle tlmo and to ob tain from thence onwnrd, subject to levlew by tho courts. It sometimes happens nt present, not that a rate Is too high but that n favored shipper Is given too low n rale, in such cases the commission would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum; and It would need only ono or two such decisions by the commlkslon to ctuo railroad com jianles of iho practice of giving Improper minimum rates. I call your attention to thu fact that my proposal Is not to give tho commission power to Initiate or orig inate rates generally, but to regulate a rate already fixed or originated by the roads, upon complnlnt nnd after Investigation. A heavy penalty should bo enacted from nny corporation which falls lo respect nn order of tho commission. I regard this power 10 establish u maximum rate as being essen tial to any schema of real leform In tho matter of railway regulation. Tho nrst ne cessity Is to secure It; and unless It Is granted to the commission there Is little use In touching tho subject at all. "All private cur lines, Induttrial roads, refrlgerntor charges and tho Ilko should bo expressly put under tho supervision of tho Interstnto commerce commission or some Blmllar body so far ns i ales and ngi ce mem, practically affecting rates, are con cerned. Tho private car owners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair and reasonable compensation on their Investment, but neither private cais nor industrial railroads nor spur lnuls should he utilized os devices for securli g I referential rates. A rebate In c i -T .' largcs, or In inlleago. or In n dlvislor of I ne rule fi,r i II ycr.uir.g ciiuikih a m yrnlcious as a rvbale in anv other wJ lower rate should nri'ly en courts Inv 1 led ttiati actually obtain on domestic porte gooo's from the American eenbontd to des tlnntlon fxcfcpt In enses where Wiiltr com petition Is the controlling Inlluenco. There should bo publicity of the accounts of common carrletsj no common cnirler engaged In Interstate buslhcfs shou.d keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regula tion, and -these books or memoranda should bo open to tho Inspection of the 'govern ment. Only In this way enn violations or cvnslons of the law be surely delected. A system of cxamlnatron of railroad ac counts should bo provided similar lo Ujnt now conducted Into tho national bitofWny the bank examiners; a few flrst-clatMnll" road accountants, If they hnd proper direc tion and proper authority to Inspect books and papers, could accomplish much In pre venting willful violations of the law, It would not be necessary for them to exam ine Into the accounts of any ral.road unlesi for good rensons they were directed to do so by the Interstnto commerc cwn mis sion, It Is greatly to be desired that some way might be found by which an agree ment ns to transportation within n state Intended to operato ns a fraud upon tho federal Interstate commerce laws could bo brought under the Jurisdiction of the fed eral authorities. At present It occurs that large shipments of Interstate tralllc arc controlled by concessions on purely state nusuicss, which of course amounts to an evasion of the law. Tho commission should have power to enforce fair treatment by tho great trunk lines of lateral and branch lines. "1 urgo upon tho congress tho need of providing for expeditious action by the In terstate commerce commission In nil these matters, whether In icgulntlng rates for transportation or for storing or for hand ling property or commodities In transit. The history of tho cases litigated under the present commerce net shows that Its efll cacy has been to a great degree destrojed by tho weapon of delay, nlmost the most formidable weapon In the hands of those whoso purpose It is to violate tho law." Labor Questions. Tho nntlonal government, the president says, has ns a rule but little occasion to deal with the group of problems known ns the labor question. State and municipal authorities must deal with these in most cases. The recommendation ts ngnin mnde ns in the message of Inst jear, that the de partment of commerce nnd labor Investi gate the general labor condition and that especial attention be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation In the several states. An Investigation of the condition of tho women engaged In In dustry In the United Slates and state and municipal legislation looking to their pro tection Is recommended. Continuing, he says; "Tho Introduction of women Into Industry Is working chnngo and disturb ance In tho domestic nnd Boclal life of the nation. The decrease In marriage, nnd especially In the birth rate, bas been co incident with It. Wc must face accom plished facts, and tho adjustment to fac tory conditions must bo made; but surely It can bo mnde with less friction nnd less harmful effects on family life than Is now the case. This whole mntter In reality forms one of the greatest sociological phe nomena of our time; It is n soclul question of tho llrst Importance, of far greater Im portance than nny merely political or ceo nomle question can be; nnd to solve It wc need nmplo data, gathered In n sane nnd clentlilc spirit In the course of an exhaust Ivo Investigation." The question of securing n healthy nnd self-respecting and mutually sympathetic attitude as between employer and laborer Is discussed nt length. In discussing tho problem, he says, wo must adopt tho prln- clplu of treating n man on his worth as a man rather than with reference to his so clnl position, his occupation or the clnss to which he belongs. The demand for de priving courts of the power to Issue Injunc tlons In labor disputes ts also touched upon. The Insurance Scandal, In tho stctlon devoted to the recent life Insurance scandal tho president declares thero Is need of a far stricter nnd more unl form regulation of tho vnst Insuranco In terests o tho country; much can be done uy legislation wnicn is not only arnsuc mil practical. The United States should In tins respect follow tho policy of other nations ny providing adequate national supervl slon ol commercial interests which nre clearly national In character Ho scores certnln olllclals of tho life Insurance com panies In tho following words: "Ilecent events have emphasized the importance of an early nnd exhaustive consideration of this question, to see whether It Is not pos slble to furnish better safeguards than the several states have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It hns been only too clearly shown that certnln of the men nt the head of these Inrge corporations take but small note of the elhlcnl distinction be tween honesty and dishonesty; they draw tho line only this side of what may be cnlled law-honesty, the kind of honesty necessary In order to avoid falling into tbe clutches of tho lnw. Of course tho only complete remedy for this condition must be found In an aroused public conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct In tho community nt Inrge. and especially among business men and In the great profession of the law and In the growth of n spirit which con demns all dishonesty, whether In rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the shape of bribery or of blackmail. Hague Fence Conference, The second peaco conference to be held at The Hague at an enrly date Is ills cussed at considerable length, nnd this gov ernment will do everything In Its power to secure tho success of the conference (o tho end that substantial progress mil) He made In the cause of Inurnationnl peace, Justice and good will. He favors u general arbitration treaty among all nations If this is possible. The Monroe doctrine, he sajs bus been tin effective Instrument for peace nnd It Is being gradually accepted by othe nations. The arrangements made with Santo Do mlngo bj which tho United Slates hns Ink en charge of lit r customs revenues from which nil Just nnd rensonuble debts wtl be paid has proved n boon to thnt countrj and enabled her to maintain her Independ ence. Peaco Is also being iestort1 there The appeal made to our government for help has been nnsvvcieu and a treaty 1: now pending In thosina'.o with tho repub lie. The Army and Navy, In connection with our foreign policy thi president discusses the condition of ou nrmy and navy Consldeilng the snail number of our soldiers, he saj s, they should be trained ns nearlv perfect as possible Continuing, he says: "Provision should bo mado by sutllclent appropriations for maneuvers of a practical uina so mat ir troops may learn how to take cine of them selves under actual servitu conditions every march, for instnnc e, I elng made w r Uio soldier loaded exact. y as le would I In nn active campaign Tho number of nosts In which the army Is kept In time i I neucu should be materially diminished an tho posts thnt ate .eft mai'o corn tpar.i: lnc v arger. . .

There should be nn Increase In the coast artillery force, so that our coast for tlllcatlons can bo In some degtte adequate ly manned." The president believes that our nnvy has nt present reached a strength suilkicnt for our present needs, nnd says; "Our nnvy must, relatively to the navies of other na tions, atwns be of greater size ll an our nnny. We have most wisely continued for a number of vcars to build up our navy, .md It hns now reached a fairly high stand ard of clllelency. This standard of elll elency must not only be maintained, but increased. It docs not teem to me neces sary, however, that the navy should at least In tho immediate future be In creased beyond tho present number of units. What Is now olcurlwneut-sary Is to Riibstltuto efficient for Inetlt'. tnt units as the latter become worn-out or ns it becomes nppnrent that they are useless " What we need now Is addltl jnnl seamf n; n large store of reserve guns, nnd sulll clent money for ample tnrgtt practice and all forms of sen practice. Immigration Question. The question of iinmlKiation, says the president, Is ono of vital Interest to tho ountry, nnd legls.ntlon governing tho In- llux of aliens Is budiy needed. On this sub Jcct he suvs: "The prime need Is to keep ut nil Immigrants who will not make good American citizens. The laws now ex isting for tho exclusion of undesirable Im migrants should be strengthened. Ade quate means should be adopted, enforced by sulllclent pennltles, to compel steam ship companies engnged In tho passenger business to observe In good faith the law which forbids them to encourage or solicit Immigration to tho United States. More over, there should bo a shurp limitation Imposed upon all vessels coming to our ports as to tho number of immigrants In ratio to tho tonnage which each vessel cun enrry. This ratio should bo high enough to insure the coming hither of us good a class of nllena as possible. Provi sion should be made for the surer punish ment of those who Induce aliens to come to this country under promise or assur ance of employment. It should be made possible to Inflict a sufficiently heavy penalty on nny emplojer vlolntlng this law to deter him from taking the tisk. It seems to me wise that there should bo an International confeicncc held to deal with this question of immigration, which has more than a merely national significance; such a conference could among other things enter at length Into tho methods for securing a thorough Inspection of would be Immigrants nt the ports from which they desire to embark before permitting them to embark." In regard to the Chinese ex clusion laws the president says: "Chlneso students, business nnd profpsslonnl men ot nil kinds not onlj mcrchnnts, but tianu- crs, doctors, mnnuiactureis, proiessors, travelers nnd the like should be encour aged to come hero and treated on precisely tho same footing thnt we Treat students. business men, travelers nnd tho like of other nations." Only the Chinese of tne coolie class, and Chlneso skilled and un skilled lnborcra should be excluded, he be lieves. The Panama Canal. The sanitary work on the Isthmus of Panama prcpnratory to beginning the actu al work of excavation has almost been completed with satisfactory results. 'Con gress is asked to aid tho furthering the work of building the canal so that it may be completed in the speediest posslblo time. In 'addition, the president says: 'Active woik In canal corstructlon, main- Is- preparatory, hns been In progress for less thnn a year and a hnlf. During thnt period two points about the canal nave ceased to bo open to debate. I'irst, the question of route; the canal will be built on the Isthmus of Pannma. Second, the question of feasibility; theio arc nophsl cal obstacles on this route thnt American engineering skill will not be able to over come without serious dlfllculty, or that will prevent the completion of the canal within n rensonablo tlmo nnd nt n reason nb'.o cost. This Is virtually the unani mous testimony of the engineers who hnva investigated tho matter for the govern ment. Minor Matters. Conditions In the Phfllpplrc islands ore generally satisfactory. Trarqulllty has existed during tho past seur with tho ex ception of n few minor disturbances. A paragraph Is devoted to the further ance of nn American merchant marine nn J the attention of congress Is called to tho report of tho merchnnt marine commis sion. The pension bureau Is congratulated for Its excellent work during the past year. Recommended that notion be tnken by con gress looking to government care of graves of confederates. Regarding tho currency, the president says that lnllatlon must be avoided, but that some provision should be made thnt will Insure n larger volume of money dur ing the fall nnd winter months than In the less nctlve seasons of tho ear. Knnctment of a law directed ngalnst bribery nnd corruption In federal elections Is ngnln urged. Legislation favored to cover enses ot breaches of trust In the public service. I.egislntlon eonfering American citizen ship on all citizens of Porlo Hlco Is advo cated. Recommended that Indian Territory and Oklahoma and that New Mexico and Ari zona be admitted Into thu union as two states. Complete revision of the eopytlght to meet modern conditions declared neces sary. The work of tl.e civil t( rvlre commission Is commended and the eaietul considera tion of the lecoinmendallons made by the commission Is urged upon congress. Government work In connection with the construction and mair.u nance of levees along the Msltslppl should be contin ued. Pension favored for members of the life saving service. In the Judgment of the president immedi ate steps should be taken for the fortifica tion of tho Hawaiian Is'nrds. KKetlve delegate to conMcss Is recom mended for Alaska. Naturalization laws arc In need of revi sion. Favorable nctlon hoped for on report of commission nppolnted by president to revise them. Abolishment of fee system of our enn su'.nr service favored.
