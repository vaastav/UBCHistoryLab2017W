RARE ORCHIDS AND FERNS USED TO ADD TO BEAUTY OF WEDDING The scon#? of the wedding: of "Presi dent Wilson and Mrs. Gait was made beautiful by floral decorations which ' those who saw them described as ^"magnificent." Tho salon parlor and dining room, which connect on the main floor of the bride's residence by means of folding doors, were thrown . fnto one large room for the occasion. The furnishings of these rooms are in mahogany, the salon parlor being deco rated in old rose brocade. Officials connected with the propa gating gardens of the government here oversaw the placing of the floral deco rations, which were arranged bv a Washington florist. The ? wvedding bower was composed of a background of farleyenste and maidenhair ferns, extending from the floor to the ceil ing, in a bay window ;?t the back of the dining room. Overhead in ihe bower a canopy of green was arranged in the form of a shell, the inner side being of Scotch heather, and these beautiful pearly white blossoms gave a charming effect. Mirror Framed in Orchids. A mirror, framed by orchids, was placed in The center of this fback ground. reflecting the wedding party. Above this mirror ;i spray of the beau tiful orchids of which the bride is so fond and for the wearing of which she has become noted, was arranged across the background of ferns. and the cor ners of the canopy with other orchids. Those used in this decoration were the I South American Cattleya Trianae, the "Dendrobium Phalanopsis, the Vaoda Coerulea and the I,aelia Anceps Alba. Sheaves of long stem American beau ty roses decorated both sides of this canopy. Nestling at the bottom of these sheaves were Cibotium ferns; graceful and lifelike. Before the bower and canopy was placed a priedieu, which has been used upon several occasions at the White House, and on which the presi dent and his bride knelt to exchange their vows. The priedieu was orna mented with clusters of orchids on either side. Farleyense Fern and Pluimsa. At the end of the salon-parlor, which is opposite the dining room, in which the wedding took place, the mantel was artistically decorated with far layonse fern and orchids. A large mir ror in the entrance hall was banked with ferns and twined about with asparagus plumosa sprayed with Amer ican beauty roses. The scheme of the dining r<5om dec oration was pink. At one end of this room was a mass of beautiful ferns, with clusters of pink roses coming from the center. On the buffets were banked growing ferns and pink roses. On the dining room table, which held the bridal cake, the table decorations were of farlayense ferns and Lady Stanley roses, two clusters being placed at each end of the table, with the bridal cake, ornamented with sprays of pink orchids, in the center. The stairway in the entrance hall and the newel post were decorated with ferns, asparagus vines and Amer ican beauty roses. CARDS TO ANNOUNCE FORMALLY MARRIAGE OF THE PRESIDENT The President^ and his bride intend | to send out tomorrow to all meml>ersj of official society, as shown by the TV'hite House lists, to some members of ? residential society in Washington ^whol have maintained an acquaintance wfthj the President's family or with that of i the bride, and to personal friends of j both, announcement cards stating in! the briefest possible language the fact j th?; f th?* wedding has taken place. It is understood that the White House official list of Washington so-1 cietv includes names, and that there will he about .~?ou other names on the list of those to whom the cards arc to go. The cards read as follows: Mr. Wood row Wilson and Mrs. Norman Gait. nee Edith Boiling. announce their marriage, on Saturday, the eighteenth of December, nineteen hundred and fifteen, Washington. D. C. 

PRESIDENT TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH CAPITAL WHILE AWAY Hot Springs, which President and Mrs. Wilson will reach early this morning:, is ideally located from the White House viewpoint. When the~"officials learned that the President would be close to Washington they were delighted. To them it meant that in case of neces sity the President could be quickly communicated with. The wire connections between Wash ington and Hot Springs are ample, both telephone and telegraph. It is the purpose of every official of the admin istration to refrain from giving the President worry and trouble while he is away, but yet they always' feel bet ter when they know he can be reached quickly, if necessary. Secretary Tumulty. who had expected to take some vacation during the Christmas holidays, will remain on the job at the White House. The Presi dent failed to clear his desk yesterday of all tlie work piled high for him, but took with him a great mass of official ma'.ter that he will work upon in spare moments. Brilliant Social Season. Toe President and his bride both con front a strenuous winter. The social seasor .*?t the White House begins al jnost immediately upon their return, and Airs. Wilson will enter upon her new duties with the certainty of many laborious ami delicate problems ahfad of ber as mistress of the White House. A large force of clerks have been at work' in the White House for ten days writing the invitations for the various receptions and dinners and it is under i stood that Mrs. Wilson will not under take this winter to reorganize the lists of guests to any unusual extent. The former lists are being followed almost wholly and any changes will have to be made upon her return. The President faces the most im portant legislative program of his career ir. the White House. He is con fronted. too, by a solid organization of the opposition party and he v.ill need I his skillfulness and tact as a leader to be able to go into, the next presiden tial campaign with the prestige his party hopes he will carry with him. The foreign situation is always ticklish, requiring thought and application, not to mention the incessant worries of Mexico. But the feeling of the Presi dent's friends is that he will be com forted by having Mrs. Wilson at his side. With the exception of Miss Margaret Wilson, who is often away from Wash ington fpr weeks at a time, arid Miss Helen Woodrow Bones, his cousin, the White House has been without mem bers of the President's family. Many evenings were spent by the President alone, owing to the occupation of other members of the family. Mrs. Wilson is domestically inclined, and her tastes and those of the President are very similar in their desire for as much of home life as it is possible for them to have in the White House. When the social season has ended the White House will resume the home atmos phere.

PRETTY GOWNS SUPPLIED BY WASHINGTON FIRMS Purchases Also Made in New York. White House Mistress to Grace State Receptions. The President's bride, notwithstand ing reports that she was not to have an elaborate trousseau, is understood among her friends to have provided herself for the position which she now occupies as "the first lady of the land with a large and most carefully selected wardrobe. In the matter of dress, the friends of the Presidents bride believe, she may be depended upon to recognize the importance of her position and to do her very best among other women with whom she as sociates to set an example of "dress ing for the occasion," which means, her friends say, that her much-discuss ed trousseau is as beautiful as that of any woman in this country could be at this time, considering that the war in Europe has recently brought about many changes In the methods of wom en when buying their apparel. Gowns of Every Fashionable Type, j There are plain gowns arid elaborate I gowns, hats, shoes, parasols, umbrellas, gloves, veils and other items In ample number for each and every occasion in the trousseau of the President's bride. A Washington firm assisted very ma terially in the gathering of soma of these, no less than eight fc'owns. ac cording to the friends of the bride having been obtained through this' source. A Baltimore firm was of as sistance too. anil supplied some arti cles and two New York firms supplied to the .!T " 5 '? addition to the purchases made at one large de wahiche"in .T?'T NeW Vork' rr""' i K,vi ?

"tie of the handsomest gowns in the entire collection is a Worth model in black velvet, which has a plain fly ing skirt and a highly embellished bodice peculiar to the ideals of a mas ler designer. Another velvet gown French in its material and treatment' is of sapphire blue. This, like the Oth er. has a train, and If thert are any evening gowns in the collection which have not trains they have apparently not been reported. The President's bride must be the hostess at four state receptions and at as many dinners of the same character the coming winter. One gown in her trousseau, worthy of such an occasion, in the opinion of her friends, is a won derful white satin, witli a trimming of white fox fur, and made with a train. A second white satin is also made with a train, but is not so rich as regards the material. This is a gown with a tunic overdress, opening in front, with the edges bound in narrow pipings. "Made-in-France" Shades. Another splendid gown in the trous seau is of blue satin, in one of the new made-in-France shades, as they are called, the colors of which, it is said, are impossible of imitation elsewhere. The skirt is hung in golden tissue and that is veiled in the finest of black tulle. Among a number of tailored suits in the trousseau is found a green gown. This is a dark cloth with a short skirt, and the new flaring half-length coat. The collar and cuffs are of moleskin, a small velvet hat is intended for weai with this suit. Of the other tailored suits in the collection, some of the most interesting are of a dark blue cloth hound in black silk braid, with a military air about the jacket, and a gray suedelike cloth, also braided in military fashion. I In the bride's trousseau, her friends and relatives say. there is also a three pieced amethyst velvet costume, with a small velvet hat. adorned with the once-again-fashionable ostrich tips. This costume has a sknrt that swings clear of the ground by three or four inches. There is a bouffant effect to the skirt, and the bodice is largely lace and net. with glints of gold and ame thyst, giving changing lights. There j is a vestee, too. to go with this cos j tume, of net and old lace. The coat is I more than half length, all of velvet, with a lining of self-colored satin em i bossed in gold. Regarded as Least Elaborate. A demi-toilet of black net, with low i neck, long sleeves and a short train, is one of the most becoming, although least elaborate, gowns of this character in the trousseau. In this same class, I also, is a delicate mauve satin, with a I trimming of blue and silver. A white broadcloth tailored suit, with white ; boots, is included in the trousseau, and ! blouses, for tailored suits, present every known variety, from fancy geor gette crepes to plain tub silks. Some i match the skirt in color, as, for exam I pie, a green crepe, with white collar j and cuffs. Most of the blouses are j white or just off the pink flesh tints i now so much in vogue. presiITIos MRS.

The decollete bodice is cut square and about this square is ;i trimming of silver em broidery. Th#4 very short sleeves are formed of folds of tulle and a crushed girdle is ?>f doth of silver. With this frock Mrs. Boiling wore silver slippers and hose, for, like most of the evening gowns of the present, the skirt is cut short, swinging well off the floor. Mrs. Rolfe Boiling, formerly of Washington, now a resident of Pan ama, wore a dainty little frock of pale blue taffeta and cream lace. It is made in the new bouffant style, pan niers of the taffeta being caught up over a petticoat of cream lace. The main part of the bodice is also of the filmy lace, with the introduction of iridescent trimming about the square low neck. A p^nel of the same iri descent trimming extends down the front of the bodice. List of the Guests. Among those who were present at the wedding were the bride's mother, Mrs. William H.

MANY MUST BE RETURNED BECAUSE FROM STRANGERS Unless Giver Is Known Those Hav ing Intrinsic Value Can not Be Kept. The assemblage of gifts at the home of the President's bride reached such a large number last night that the effort which has been heretofore maintained to catalogue and classify and acklowl edge them was abandoned and the work of doing so will be delegated to White House and other employes in the gov ernment service. They have been sent to the White House. In view of the ; fact that It was the intention of the bride and the President to keep every ' thing in connection witB the wedding as [ simple and informal as possible the names of most of the donors of these gifts have been withheld from publica tion^. The .members of the cabinet and their wives sent individual gifts. Quantities of cut glass and silver have been received. One particularly hand some gift was a Tiffany glass and brass desk set.

PRESIDENT WILSON AND BRIDE ARE BOTH NATIVE VIRGINIANS Both the I*resident and hi* bride are Virginians. He was born at Staunton, December 2S. 1S5?. and she was born at Wytheville. forty-three years ago. The president is. therefore, fifty-nine years old. The bride is the widow of Norman ??tUt of Washington and tame here twenty years ago with him to live. She has been noted for her interest, in char itable affairs, and until recently ser\e< as an adviser for St. Thomas" Church to the Episcopal Kye. tear and Throat Hospital.

The acquain tance of the President and the bride of last night began in the early autumn of 1914, and from that time she was fre'iuent guest at the Executive Ma"" sion. and last summer spent a month as the guest of Miss Margaret Wilson at the summer W:hite House at < Ornish, \ H The engagement was announced October 6, not long after the presiden tial party returned to Washington for the winter. Active in Charitable Work. The bride of last night has belonged to none of the distinct social sets of Washington, but has hee'n noted for her activity in charitable and philan thropic work. From the late Norman Gait she inherited considerable means, including a large interest in a prosper ous mercantile business in Washington, but she has never been active in busi ness affairs personally. She loves flow - ers being noted for the wearing of or chids, and is fond of books and out door recreations. She has been a familiar figure in the streets of W ash ington, driving an electric runabout, and is known by sight to many Wash ingtonians. She plays the piano, sings and is fond of poetry, and she has been one of the President's most interested listeners when he has read aloud his favorite poems in the intimacy of the familv life. , It has been reported that the bride of last night has refused to part with the residence. 130S 20th street northwest, In which she has lived for so long and in which the wedding ceremony was performed. It is said by members of the family, however, that this residence belongs to the Gait estate, and that she has a one-fourth interest 111 it. It is a tastefully arranged home, near Dupont Circle, somewhat small by com parison with the large mansions which surround it. It is not larg.; enough for entertaining on an extensive scale. Bridegroom's Notable Career. In marrying the President the bride of last night is Joined to a man who, aside from being the President of the United States, has been distinguished in manv fields of endeavor. The Presi dent is'the son of Rev. Joseph R. Wil son and Jessie Woodrow Wilson, the former a distinguished scholar and clergyman of the Presbyterian Church nf the South. The President is himself a Presbvterian. His boyhood days were spent in Augusta. ?a . in Col"?bla, C and Wilmington, N. C. where ne nrepared for college. In IS <4 he en tered Davidson College, remained one vear and in the fall of 1S75 went to Princeton, from which he was grad fi^f-irSad-U -rVU.?.hca! president of Princeton University. He resigned in October. 1910. when nomi nate.! for the position of Governor of New Jersey, to which he was elected by a great plurality. I*ater, as every one knows, lie was elected President of th? I'nited States He is the author of many standard Itooks on practical poli tics. political economy, history and lit erature. President Wilson married Miss Ellen L/ouise Ax sen of Savannah. Ga, In lh85, his first wife having died August 6, 1*14, in the White House. 

ROLFE BOLLING 50 POUNDS TOO SMALL FOR HIS SUIT But Tailor Rushes New Evening Clothes for President's New Brother-in-Law. Friends and relatives of Rolfe Boiling, formerly of Washington, now a resi dent f.f Panama, who uvrc present at the wedding last night of the President and Mrs. Gait, the latter being Mr. Boiling's sister, were astonished to find that he has lost fifty pounds in weight since he left Washington to live in Pan ama. As a result Mr. Boiling, who arrived with Mrs. Boiling in New York Friday, on their way to the wedding, was hard put to it, inasmuch as he found that he had no dress clothes that would fit I him with their old-time accuracy. He managed to persuade a tailor to fit him out in a hurry, however, with another evening suit. j Mrs. Rolling had a similar difficult ex perience in regard to a gown to wear at the wedding. She reported that she j was unable to find anything that suited | her. in the very latest fashion at Pan ama, and put off the selection of a gown to wear at the wedding until she arrived in N."w York. The steamer <m which they came to this country docked twenty-four hours late, and she found herself, so to speak, without a wed ding garment. She had made an engagement with a Washington dressmaker for Thursday, expecting to \v here that day. hut t e lateness of the steamer's arrival upset all her calculation's. A hurried sean-h of the 5th avenue shops in New York yielded what she wanted, and she was lucky enough ti> find that tlv pale blu?* taffeta frock which she wore to the wedding last night fitted her without material alterations. It was hastily boxed and taken in a cab to the trrfin for Washington. Washington Law College Officers.
