PrograrruFor the Week. A resolution looking to action on the death of President McKinley will be presented In the Senate Tuesday by either Senator Foraker or Senator Hanna, probably the former, and after Its introduction the senate will ad journ immediately as a mark of re spect to the memory qf the dead pres ident.

It Is not now expected that anything will be done on that day be yond the announcement of the death of. Senator Kyle, following which the senate, fn accordance with custom, will adjourn for the day. Tuesday the president's message will be read, and after Its reading the -announcement bf,the death of President McKin ley will follow at once, whereupon, un der the precedent established when Presidents Lincoln and Garfield died, resolutions providing for the appoint ment of a committee to a,ct with a similar committee' of the h6ise of rep resentatives, to take appropriate ac tion relative to the matter and tlien calling for Immediate adjournment for the day, will be adopted.

Senator Frye, .himself Is the author of the new bill. Senator Morgans canal bill will be a duplicate of Representative Hep- "burn'sblll on the canal question. Other early bills of importance wtlll be one looking to the construction of a sub marine cable from the western coast of Hawaii and another providing for the establishment of-a new executlyo department to be known as the de partment of commerce. Thje various reciprocity treaties pending will be called at an early date. CUE TO THE

State Department nt Washington Is Working on That Theory. Washington, Dec. 2. Notwithstand ing a flood of conflicting rumors as to Miss Stone, the slate department is working upon the theory that the wo man Is alive. The difficulty appears to be one of terms; it has been impossi ble to convince the brigands that the $66,000 in the hands of Mr. Dickinson represents every cent of money sub scribed toward ransoming the captives and they are holding out for a mini mum of $100,000 which Is only $10,000 less than their origlpal demand) It Is stated that not a single dqllar as been subscribed to the ransom fund since the outpouring of the first two or three days following the appeal for contributions. Secretary Hay received a cablegram from Spencer Eddy, United States charge de' affaires at Constantinople, saying that he had received Informa tion on what he. regarded as good authority tohe effect 'that Miss Stone and Madame Tsilka are still alive. Fears Miss Stone Is Dead. New York, Dec. 2. Rev. Dr. Henry C. Haskell, representative of the American board of foreign missions of Boston at Samakoy, Bulgaria, sent the following dispatch from, Sofia, as to rumors of the death qf Miss EVe.M. Stone, the missing missionary: "Ve hope the dreadful news is untrue, but there is reason to make us fear other wise, if the captive's are dead, the fact would account for the determin ed insistence upon ' the part of the brigands that ransom money should he paid before the captives arp sur rendered to us. it would account for the stubborn refusal of the brigands to give safe conduct to one of our representatives to see Miss Stone and Mrs. Tsilka In order to certify to us that they are alive before we pay over the ransom money," "Stortl Must Die. Washington. Dec. 2. In the United States s'upreme court an opinion was handed down in the case of Lulgl Stor tl versus the state of Massachusetts, affirming the decision of the court be low.

The price fixed Is LT?A7een ?4,000,000 and $5,000,000. The1 questions of freo trade and citi zenship will be decided by congress, which it is believed here, will grant these concessions.

The United States supreme court Monday render ed a decision in the ense of Emll J. Ppnlto vn. th TTnftpri Rfntns. Thin In ,...,, .......... .......... J the case known as the ' lourteen uia mond rings case" and involves Un constitutionality of the imposition of customs duties upon merchandise brought into the United States from the Philippine islands af"ter the ex change qf the peace treaty with Spain. The o'pjniqn was handed down by Chief Jtlstlqe Fuller. The opinion, was adverse to the claims of the goveu tnnt on the ground that the Philip pine lslaridB -were, at the time tthe rings werq brought In, American, ter ritory. C'eaBlng to be foreign 'territory whqn the Paris treaty was signed, ihey, became domestic territory', he said. The decision in the DeLlma Porto Rlcn qases was cited at length and It has been held that the resolu tion adopted by congress concerning the Phil(pp(nes was nqt sufficient to change the situation. Gray, Shlras, White a'nd McKenna dissented. This was one of the tw;o important cases left undecided by the court ut its last term when it decided a num ber of cases involving the customs re lations of the United States with in sular possessions. The cases decided at that time, bore entirely upon the relations of this country with Porto Rico and this was the only case of a large number then argued and consid ered which involved the relations of the United States with the Philippines. Much Interest has been manifested In tho Philippine case because of the probability of legislation relating to the Philippine case at the approaching session of congress. The record shows that Pepke, who was the respondent in the court below, was a soldier In the United States army In the Island of Luzop, that while there and after the ratification of the peace treaty he purchased 14 diamond rings while still in the service of the Unit ed States and brought them with him aboard a United States transport to San Francisco, where he was muster ed out. Later he came with the rings to Chicago, where the rings Were seized by the customs officers under the claim that the Philippine islands were foreign territory and merchan dise brought from those Islands to the United Sjtates was subject to customs duties which were not paid by Pepke. Another Dooley Decision. Wasnlngton, Dec. 2. The United States supreme court decided the sec ond of the Dooley cases, Involving the constitutionality of the law'of April 12, providing for the collection of duty on articles shipped from the United States into Porto Rico. The decision was rendered by Justice Brown and sustained the government. It was held that as Porto Rico Is not foreign territory the goods shipped to Porto Rico are not exports, but whether ex ports or Imports the wide range of congress In the matter of taxation was sufficient for a contingency of this character. At best, he said, the duty was a temporary expedient, and as it was explicitly provided in the Foraker act that the Porto Rlcan legislature could change the character of the en actment It was held that the Foraker act was merely legislation in the in terest of Porto Rico. The Foraker act was sustained on the grounds laid down in the Downs case, another of the insular cases decided at the last term. The decision of 'the lower court was affirmed. Justice Brown ex pllclty said that the opinion was not to be coostrued as a justification of export duties. Justice White con curred in an independent decision. Chief Justice Fuller, Harlan, Brewer and Peckham dissented. The case grew out of $1,433 tariff on goodK shipped from New York to Porto Rico May 3. 1900 to Oct. 23, by Dooley, Smith & Co., to their agent In San JUan, under the act of May 12, 1900. Austrian Crisis. Vienna, Dec. 2. Although It Is not known to a certainty what, passed at tljo ministerial council Friday under the presidency of Emperor Francis JoSeph, 'there is an uncomfortable feeling that a large sum Is wanted for military purposes. The economic de pression of Austria-Hungary is such 'that fresh military burdens would be rendered well-high Intolerable. It Is not, astonishing that the minister of finance 1b at his wits end to moot the requirements 'of the minister of war and a difficulty has arisen between them. A dissolution is probable In the even of 'further parliamentary ob struction. Both in Vienna and Buda peBth the situation Inspires a good deal of "concern. Miner's, House Blown Up.
