reduced to one dol lar The state is getting liberal Up to the hour of going to press that call for an etra session of the legislature had not been issued Farmer James Wilson of Iowa is the Dean of the presidents cabinet i > 1 He is the only man left of the original 69 al cabinet of McKinley The advertising columns of The 4 Journals Christmas edition will tell t you what to choose for your presents and where you can get them The Tallahassee Sun complains that state house officials are denied Ice water and fires at the same time Reminds one that internal neat some times needs a cooler L An exchange suggests that some one give the Palatka TimesHerald candidate for governor but the Pa r latka man doubtless had his candi date picked some months ago Under the new general statutes with every pleading filed In the courts hereafter there will also have to be filed a copy of same to be served on opposing counsel or opposite party The death of Senator Carter of Levy will necessitate the calling I of a special election in Levy county to choose a senator as Mr Carter had served only onehalf of the term for which he was elected The child labor proposition promises to be one of the problems of the next legislature but questions of more vital interest to the state will more than likely sidetrack this Issue in the limited time in which the Solons ate given to enact and repeal laws Penrose was the first man at the bat in thc senatorial game which has Just started In Washington but when Pitcher Roosevelt throws his answer to the Pennsylvania statesman In 4 that negro controversy we predict that Penrose will go down and out in short order T J Appleyard of Lake City was defeated in Washington Tuesday Ii Might for the position of scrgeantat arms of the Democratic caucus He deserved bettor but when it is con sidered that his successful opponent hailed from the homo of John Sharpe Williams ith3flot surprising If there is one piece of legislation that the chief executive should I force through the next house and senate it is the reapportionment bill i It has been twenty years since the representation in the legislature has been apportioned and the present I allotment of scats in the legislative part of OUI government is inequitable I and unfair The legislature ten years ago failed to pass this bill as i the statute requires but the gover I nor should soe to it that the session of 1007 does not adjourn without com plying with this statute I A dispatch from Bronson to the L TimesUnion says After an illness of several months I duration Hon N R Carter state senator from the Twentyfirst sena i torial district and one of the most prominent men in the state and coun ty died at his home in Levyville Sati urday morning at G oclock The death of Senator Carter was expected as his condition has been without hope for several weeks He was surrounded by his family when I I the end came all of whom had been devoted in their attentions to him dur ing his illness 1 I Senator Carter vas 73 years of age and a native of Mississippi He serv ed with distinction in the Confed erate army Ho has been a resident of Levy count for thirtyfive years and had always been identified with the best interests and upbuilding or the county He had served as county commissioner and county treasurer anti was elected state senator in 1004 and served with credit and ability to his county and state at the last session of the legislature His death has cast a gloom over I the entire county and ho will be lorcly missed t The Regulation of Schools by Congress No portion of President Roose yells message to Congress has at tracted wider attention or been the subject of so much comment as his recommendations regarding the treat ment of Japanese school children by the California authorities and his views upon the subject are coming in for severe condemnation from all quarters The idea that a state can be forced to regulate its public schools In accordance with the wishes I of Congress is preposterous and the I intimation of the president that such power is vested in Congress Is ridic ulous in the extreme Such an Idea will hardly meet with approval from any source If it were possible for Congress to force the people of California to re ceive Japanes3 pupils Into the schools provided for white children upon a basis of equalty Congress could compel the state of Florida for in stance to allow a negro subject of Great Britain or any other country to enter the schools provided for Cauca sians and there be received on the same terms as a white child The right of southern states to pro vide separate schools for the races has never been questioned and proba bly will not be as long as the facili ties provided in the respective schools are equal in every respect and there is not the slightest particle of differ ence between the practice in the south in this regard and the plan of the California authorities who sim ply desire to separate the Orientals from the Caucasians just as the south spearates the whites and ne groes Congress would undoubtedly have a right to dictate if the question in i volved schools supported by the fed eral government but schools support ed by states or municipalities always have been and always should he free from federal interferance even In the I least particular Congress has about as much right to regulate Sunday schools and to dictate the text of a sermon as it has to attempt the regu I laion of the public schools of Cali fornia or any other state and any action that may be taken with this end in view in the present instance will be the precursor of vigorous con demnation and protest throughout the length and breadth of the land And now Major Dapray the general army officer who assists General Fos ter is married and on his way to the capital with his bride Must be get ting lonesome for those court judges who seem to be the only elegibles left I The Flomaton Depot I Under Construction The Pensacola Journal makes a plea for depot accommodations at Floma ton Since the station house was burned there some time ago several box cars have been used by the em ployes as a station but the public is uncared for by the company Floma i tau is a junction point and in these i da s of trains behind schedule time I the people suffer a real hardship while waiting there The Journal calls on the Alabama railroad commission to take the case in hand Mobile Reg ister isteiThe The Journal is informed since tak ing the matter up that a force of men I is now at work on the construction of the Flomaton depot though no evi dence to that effect was apparent un til this week If the railroad company means busi ness now and completes the depot within a reasonable time the Ala oama railroad commission need not interest itself in the matter The act remains however that this depot should have been built long ago and the railroad commission was neg lecting its duty in failing to compel tho railroad company to act The next gubernatorial campaign is approximately eighteen months oft and yet whenever Pensacolas Jen nings gets out of the Deep Water City he is thrown bouquets on every hand Coming events cast their shadows before J I L 1 J Protection of Waterfowl The fact that waterfowl are becom ing more scarce each year has at last received the official notice of the Uni 1 ted States department of agriculture and it Is possible that legislation will be recommended looking to the pro tection of this valuable source of food supply A recent Issue of the Wash ington Post contained the following short article relative to the matter I Waterfowl are steadily diminishing In numbers all over the United States and ome species appear to be threatened with extinction in the near future according to a report Issued by the agricultural department on the distribution and migration of North American ducks geese and swans The report says that these fowl were formerly abundant over the whole United States and their value for food was great They have formed in the past and should con tinue to form a valuable asset and im portant source of revenue to the sev eral states which harbor them Several state legislatures nave en I acted laws looking to the preservation of the numerous species of waterfowl and the present report Is made with the idea of furnishing information with reference to practical legislation In this state legislation looking fo the protection of waterfowl that is with reference to an open season is hardly necessary because they are only found In Florida during the regu lar hunting season but in states further north laws should be enacted limiting the time in which waterfowl may be killed A limit upon the num ber of bfrds that may be killed by a hunter or a party of hunters In any one day would do much toward ke p ing ducks and geese from becoming extinct and no true sportsman would object to such restriction ft

POOR TOM PLATT AND HIS TROUBLES E aHK3KS l frH dMc Too t Me too Platt wisely concludes to be as closemouthed as a clam but he cant keep hfe friends from guessing and talkIngTampa Tribune Holding Fast Thos Platt denies that he Is to re sign his seat In the senate The New Yorker is not in thehabit of turning loose a good thing Falatka Times Herald Not Altogether Unanimous The report Senator Platts resig nation seems to have been confirmed and approved by everyone ex cept Senator Platt DeLand Record Demurrable Certificate Senator Platt and his wife in their deed of separation gave each other a certificate of character but the scurvy newspaper reporters of New York have about annihilated the old mans Albany Ga Herald Sorry For Him 0 One cannot help feeling sorry for Senator Platt of New York As a man of the world he has lived rapidly caring little for anything except his own pleasure But he is a man for all that and In his old age his sor rows have been many He is a mil lionaire but all of his money cannot I buy for him the happiness that comes naturally to the man with the hoe Miami News In the Limelight Again Uncle Tom Platt is again in the limelight His personal morality has been called into question and his church and pastor are no longer his companions 0 n the contrary they are now demanding his resignation from the senate So long as Uncle 1 Tom only grafted robbed the public indirectly by legislation and nonleg islation of some millions aided the insurance grafters nought some laws they wanted and bought off some they did not want so long he was all right and they stood with him And yet there are people who ask what is the I matter with the church and wonder I why it has lost its influence Tampa Times r SPICY COMMENT FROM STATE PAPERS w Ir An Editor and a Schooner A Savannah editor has bought a schooner and retired from the news paper business Just one schooner should not have put him out of the business Lake Butler Star Press Getting Sassy The press of the state is awfully sassy these days Some are saying horrid things about one another and the Floridian goes so far as to tell Graham of Manatee that he either ought to havo killed the Tallahassee Sun man or committed suicide This all comes aboutby the boys having a big feed at the Ocala editorial meet a two days trip to thfe everglades a banquet at Jacksonville and one at Tampa Thereidnothing like a full stomach to give an editor nerveSt Petersburg Independent Publicity Sometimes Hurts When the roses bloom again there will be something doing over in Tallahassee Sixty days will seem a very short time in which to handle all those investigations that are be ing called for and a few days during the session should be set aside to pass the reappointment bill discuss drainage and Insurance etc and then the third house must have one night to themselves during the ses sion Pensacola Journal Yes find some of these doings are in the great hereafter likely to get those august lawmakers In embarrasing trouble with the Florida press who will watch their deeds like a hawk does a chicken Miami Metropolis How They Do in Sanford It Is more fun to see a man read a puff on himself in a newspaper than to see a fat man slip on a banana peel The narrowminded man reads it over seven or eight times and then goes around to appropriate what copies he can The kindhearted man goes around to the office and pays what he owes The successful busi ness man who advertises regularly and makes money by it immediately starts out to find the editor and the two walk silently down the street nnd the business man takes sugar in his and they both eat a clove or two and life is sweeter and peace settles down on their hearts for moments Such is the experience of a mustard seed that falls on different ground Sanford Chronicle Bought the Land The latest reliable information in regard to the drainage project south west of this city is that the Florida East Coast Railway Company has bought all the land owned by the Bos ton and Florida Atlantic Coast Land Company and of the East Coast Land Company and of the East Coast Canal and Transportation Company in the proposed drainage district and would begin the work as soon now aa it is possible to get the men and dredges there The mixed ownership of the land to be drained was one of the main causes of the delay in beginning the work as all the companies were nor prepared to do their share in pushing It at once but now that the land is i owned by only one company and that I the one most interested in having the work done and in doing it at once there will probably be no further de lay but dirt will begin to fly before many moonsPalm Beach News A i 74 I NEWSPAPERS AND MEN r it Jacksonville TimesUnion A Curious Individual who publishes a newspaper asked the Lake City In dex a number of questions relative to its ownership and control The In dex replied to the questions answer ing all the specifications This the Index had a perfect right to do But all of these questions and all questions of a similar character ask ed of any newspaper a perfectly prop er reply would be It is none of your business It is nobodys business who owns or controls a newpaper the only ex ception that we can now think of be ing in the case of an individual who claims that the newspaper has injured him If the paper itself is not incor porated or is not solvent In this case the Individual who claims to have sustained damage has a right to know I who inflicted it I But in other cases what does it matter who owns a newspaper WJiat I a newspaper says it says before all I men In a free country such as this I is supposed to be an opinion is not I important because it is the opinion of this man or of that man Its ac ceptance depends on whether it is right or wrong and of this each man must judge The character of a news paper must be fixed by its conduct not by its ownership Does it up hold the right and condemn the1 wrong If so it is worthy of respect but even then its opinion on any sub ject should not be accepted unless the Individual considering it approves it A paper that is generally right is not always right The man who magnifies the ques tion of the ownership of a paper in sults the people He presumes that the people do not think for them selves but obey the orders of one master or another What matters it to a selfreliant thinking man who gives him advice Does he not de cide for himself whether it Is sound Is the advice affected to any extent by the personality of the man who gives it Certainly not If the man who receives it weighs it himself and acts on his own judgement If a newspaper is clean it is fit to go into the homes of the people even if It is owned by a debaucher If it is unclean it is not fit even if it were owned by a saint If a newspaper espouses the right It is good Influ ence no matter whether the man who owns It be good or bad If a newspaper works to build up a community it Is a friend of the peo ple of that community If it works to add to the prosperity of all parts of the state it Is the friend of the people of the state and he is their enemy who would seek to impair its usefulness
