Ireland. r ; Land League Tactics In Ulster Terror- Ism maid Lawlessness .Bajreotting A p- plled to the Constabulary A New Peril tor Parnell. - London, Dec. 9. A Dublin dispatch to the Times says : The Land League is conducting the campaign in the North with considerable skill, modifying its pro gramme and proceedings to avoid offending the pre judices of the people of Ulster. In that province there is quite a ounerent tone in weir speeches rrom that prevailing in other parts of the country, with the view of conciliating Presbyterians, Liberals and Orangemen. The system of 'Baycotting' has been ap plied to six detachmeutB of constabulary in different parts of Ireland." The government has ordered accommoda- dation for one hundred and fifty soldiers to be prepared at Ballina, Ireland, where a lady, a landowner, was recently mobbed and as saulted in the street. Any two magistrates can bind over per sons whom they have reason to suspec of even an intention to participate in unlawful proceedings or assembly, or in case of re fusal to be bound over they can commit them to jail. They can bind over any person whom they believe can give evidence relative to such proceedings, and if they refuse to be bound over to give evidence they can commit them to jaiL The correspondent of the Time at Dublin, commenting on this, says : "The truth is the magistrates, agents and landlords generally are panic-stricken, and do not venture to enforce the law. A prosecu tion brought by the Attorney General at Bal linsloe, and another in Sligo, have broken down, which has had a discouraging effect. There is also a difficulty about treating Land League meetings as unlawful assemblies. The magistrates do not feel justified in regarding the threat to 'Baycott' as coming within the act, as it does not imply violence." The London correspondent of the Leeds Mercury says he hears that the law officers are considering Mr. Farnell's recent speech at Waterford, and it is not improbable that be may be indicted on a distinct and separate charge in connection with that speech. Mr. bhaw-Leievre, the new Commissioner of Works and Buildings, who is universally recognized as holding the most liberal views on the subject of Irish land, and who has said that he was advanced to his present post specially with a view to the services he could render in debates on the land question, in his speech at Beading last night said that ownership was the highest degree of se curity known to the law, but there were manr degrees of security for tenants short of this which might be capable of more immediate application, rue formation of a class of peasant proprietors, he said, must nec essarily be slow, unless w are prepared to ex propriate the landlords at our own price. It would be easy to show that this oould not be for the benefit of Ireland. It would multi ply the evils of absenteeism five-fold, and would result in not only a fifth to but all the rent of Ireland being sent out of Ireland in the shape of interest on purchase money. A system of extended ownership could not last if it had its origin in confiscation and robbery. Whatever rs aone mast te witn every regard to the rights or compensation of the landlord. He said he had no sympathy with the plans of intimidating and the violent methods of the Land League. They had set up a govern ment in opposition to that of the Queen, and this was a state of things which could not be allowed to continue. The Meeting Near MosBghan A nt i- Leagaen Present in Force Ko Disturb ance of the Proceeding. ParnelF. Sec retary IndictedLawlessness in Cork A Sad Case of Eviction An Old Man Kl pires in the Arms ofthe Process Servers. Dublin, Dec. 9. A special last night from Monaghan to thf Dublin Express says the greatest excitement prevailed at Monaghan. Lord EoBsmore was accompanied by Lord Mandeville, who will assist at the anti-League meeting. Mandeville telegraphed to his agent at Fortadown to send one thousand men to Scotstown without delay. Another telegram was dispatched to the district grand master of the Orangemen of Armagh to send ten thousand men. A similar dispatch was sent to Lord Crichton to send one thousand men from Fermnagh. These are certain to ar rive, and the number will be more than doubled by men from Monaghan and the sur rounding neighborhood. The . men will be supplied with some means of defense. The most active eff orts are being made by the con stitutional party to make the meeting a suc cess. - The assemblage will be the most for mal and perhaps the most dangerous to the peace that has been witnessed in Ulster for some years. If the.- Ulster landlords take pattern by the example set them by Lords Bossmore, Mandeville and Crichton . the Leasruers would have little to say in Ulster. The Cork grana lory nave louna true Dins against Mr. Healey, M. P., private secretary to Mr. irarneii, ana jur. naisn or me xiaiia Land League, on the charge of intimidating Cornelius Manning The trial will probably take olace on Tuesday next. Mr. JBenoe joues, oi xtanaon, a ceieDraiea South of Ireland agriculturalist and a writer on the land question, has been xsaycotted. An attempt was made to strangle one bum van, a process server, near Skibbareen. Law lessness in Cork is increasing to an alarming extent. A sad and dramatic eviction took place in county Wicklow yesterday. An - old man named Arthur xlavanagh, in feeble neaitn, who had a cabin on the property of Earl Fitz william, had fallen behind in his rent. A decree of ejectment was obtained by the Earl at the last Wicklow Sessions. His game keeper, with two bailiffs, went to execute the decree yesterday afternoon. They had to carry Kavanagh out of the house, and as he was crossing me tnresnoia oz ms caDin me poor old man gave one gasp and died in the gamekeeper's arms. His body was laid by the road. Over it for hours sat his only mourner, a granddaughter. Kavanagh was formerly in a good position. He had been unable to work for two years, and was bed ridden for some time. An immense land meeting was held at Scotstown near Monaghan to-day. There were thousands of Orangemen prepared to have a counter demonstration, but they dis persed at the urgent entreaties of the author- T .

Congressional Legislation The Electoral Connt A Lobs; Debate Expected The Proposed . Honor to , General Grant The Coateiat for Senator "Wallace's Beat General - Garfield's Senatorial Office Contested Election Cases. . Washihotoh, Dee. 9.-There is no telling how long the debate on the electoral count resolution will run. Mr. F. Wood again tried to-day to bring the House to an agreement with reference- to closing the discussion. He wanted to know how long the gentlemen on the other side proposed to disturb the pub lic business. - No answer was vouchsafed. The House Committee on Military Affairs will on ' Tuesday next consider General MeCook'i bfll to place General Grant on the retired list of the army. This bill has cre ated considerable discussion among Senators and Representatives. Some Democrats op pose the bill on the. ground ' that . General Grant took an active part in the recent presi dential election. It is believed, however, that enough Democrats will unite with the Republicans to secure favorable consideration of the measure. ! " l ' ' "' '. "", : A gentleman whose nomination to a judi cial position wiU be sent to the Senate soon test evening called Judge Strong's -attention to the publication in the dispatches of his in tended resignation. "It is practically cor rect," said Judge Strong. 'In a very short time I will be off tbe bench.n In speaking of the Pennsylvania Senator- ship to-night, Senator Wallace said that while he regarded Hon. Galusha A. Grow as lead ing in the "contest, yet in the event of any combinations that would operate disad van- tageously for the ex-Speaker he thought his successor would most probably be c Hon. Thomas M. Bayne, representing the Twenty- third Pennsylvania district in . Congress. When reminded that ft had been rumored here for some days that Governor Moyt was developing much strength in the direction of the Senatorship, he replied that he did not think that the Governor would enter the lists at all, as the information received from Har risburg to-day indicated such a determination on his part. The credentials of General Garfield as Senator-elect from Ohio are still among the arch ives of the Senate. It is expected though that within a day or two General Garfield will by letter request the Vice President to return the same to him so he may return them through the Governor of Ohio to the Legis lature. In thus returning the credentials the General will also transmit a letter declining the Senatorial office to which he had been elected. Senator Pendleton, in a conversa tion on the subject of the vacancy which will be caused by General Garfield's declination, said he was clearly of the opinion that the Legislature could legally proceed to elect a successor to Senator Thurman ten days after it received the notice of President-elect Gar field's declination. He had carefully studied the law concerning the case and his opinions based on the result of a very laborious re search of all the legal authorities bearing on the subject. The Committee of Ways and Means held a meeting to-day to consider the recommenda tions made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in his anuual report. A majority of the committee were of the opinion that the present law relating to the adhesive stamp tax upon proprietary medicines, cosmetics, bank checks and deposits, &c., should be modified. At the same time it was felt it would be impossible to do anything on the subject at the present session. The subject was referred, however, to the Committee on Internal Revenue, of which Mr. Carlisle is chairman. Congressman Hurd intends if possible to secure action in some manner this session on his bill, the supplement of which is an act to establish regulations as to imported goods in bond and with duties paid and for other pur poses. Mr. Hurd's bill was intended to pre vent discrimination against certain "railroad lines and the trading public in the matter of transportation of goods through Canada. The bill provides that it shall be unlawful f orUnited States customs officers to seal any car in which goods, wares or merchandise shall have been placed to be transported from one point or place in the United States to an other point or place in Canada. The bill also levies a duty of 80 per cent, ad valorem upon every railroad car manufactured in the Do minion of Canada and brought into the United States. In conversation this morning Mr. Hurd said if he could not secure action on his bill this session he had another plan in mind by which he thought he could accom plish Ms purpose. The abrogation of the treaty of Washington would do away with all the unjust and discriminating regulations in force in the Dominion. With reference to American lake ports he said he contemplated offering a resolution directing the President to give notice to Great Britain of the inten tion of the United States to abrogate the treaty of Washington. Mr. Hurd believed that the New England representatives who represent the people that have suffered on account of the persecutions of American fish ermen would vote for such a resolution. A new treaty could then be made which would not only regulate the fisheries, but adequate ly protect the interests of lake ports border ing on Canada. . There are nine contested election cases re maining to be decided by the House. Some of them will probably never be heard of. Mo brief has been filed in the contest of Harrison against Shelly of the Fourth Alabama dis trict. The evidence adduced by Mr. .Harri son is meagre, and the case will probably neverbe brought before the House. There are two reports in the case of Bixbee against Hull, of the Second Florida district. The majority report is in favor of the sitting mem ber, Mr. Hull. Mr. McCole, who is contest ing the seat of Mr. Orth, from the Ninth Indiana district, has - asked for more time in which to file evidence. It is not believed that Mr. McCole will make out a case, and the contest will hardly be brought before the House. Messrs. Merchant and Herbert gave notice of their intention to contest the seat of Mr. Acklen, of the Third Louisana district, but they have failed to present any evidence and the contest will probably be dropped. The committee is ready to report in favor of the sitting member in the contest of Boynton vs. Loring, of the Sixth Massachusetts dis trict. No report has yet been made in the celebrated Donnelly-Washburne case. The Electoral Connt A Republican Cau cus A Policy of Active Opposition to the Morgan Resolution. Washington, Dec. 9. The Republican Representatives and Senators in joint caucus to-night decided unanimously to oppose the passage of the Morgan joint rule by every parliamentary device. There was some dif ference of opinion in the caucus held last night by Republican Representatives alone on the question of filibustering to defeat the Morgan resolution. The exponents of the extreme theory were in a small minority, and they did not seem to be very firmly grounded in their suggestions for conservative action. The fact that there was a difference of opin ion, however, led to the call for a joint caucus at 7:30 this evening. There was a large attendance of Republican Congressmen. Senator Anthony was made chairman of the caucus and Townsend of Ohio secretary. Mr. Conger briefly stated the object of the joint caucus. He said that the question presented for decision was whether the representatives of the party should resist the passage of the "infamous Morgan resolution." Mr. Conger was decidedly of the opinion that it should not be allowed to pass. He explained that on the evening previous in the caucus of Republican Representatives Judge Lapham, of New York, had offered a resolution which he believed met the approbation of a majority ot those present. Judge Lapham's resolution was read. After a preamble reciting the belief that the Morgan resolution was unconstitutional this resolution pledges the Republicans to resist its passage by every means known to parliamentary law. Mr. Robeson made one of the principal speeches of the evening. He avowed the belief that the Morgan rule origi nated as a . part of a scheme to count in a Democratic President in the event of a close election. He outlined the position assumed by the Republican Representatives in oppos ing the resolution and pointed out what he claimed were inconsistent and incongruous features of the resolution. He believed the resolution to be unconstitutional and revolu tionary, and thought that its passage should be firmly resisted. Senator Blaine made a speech which elicited great applause. It was ringing and stalwart in tone. After criticising the resolution he spoke of the old twenty second joint rule which had been cited by the Democrats as a precedent for the new rule they now proposed to enact. Blaine denied " that the old twenty-second rule was a precedent for anything. . He claimed that the rule was rendered extinct and disposed of as a prece dent by the creation of the electoral commis sion, a tribunal in the creation of which both Democrats and Republicans had a hand. He maintained that the proposed rule was dangerous, because . it was at variance w ith the theory of the framers of the constitution that Congress should not have the power to elect a President, v Speeches were also made by Messrs. Keif- er, Lapham, Teller, Saunders, Ferry, Robe son, Hisoock, Conger, Burnsido, . Hawley, Haskell and Butterworth. These gentlemen were all of the opinion that the electoral rule implied a usurpation of power on the part of Congress in assuming the right to count the electoral vote. , The Lapham resolution was finally adopted without a dissenting voice. 

FORTY-SIXTH CONGRESS. f - Washington, Dec. 9. Senate. On motion of Mr. Pendleton, of Ohio, so much of the President a annual message as refers to civil service reform, non assessment of government clerks for political purposes, etc., was referred to the select committee to examine the several branches of the civil service - with instructions to re port at an early day by bill or otherwise. Mr. Pendleton introduced a joint resolu tion for the purpose of obtaining the privi lege of opening a, road -and highway from the Canada line of the United States and British America through British Columbia to Fort Wrangell and Sitka in Alaska. Referred to Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. Randolph gave notice that immediately after the morning hour on Monday ne would call up the bfll for the relief of Fitz John Porter, and desired to call the attention of the Senators to the amendment offered by him yesterday. Mr. Plumb reported the bill to extend the time for filing claims for horses and equip ments lost by officers and enlisted men in the service of the United States.' The time for filing these claims expired in 187;. The bill was opposed by -Messrs. Thurman,; Kern an and others, on the ground" that the govern ment could not now obtain rebutting evidence where false or irregular claims were present ed. Without disposing of the bill the Sen ate,-on motion of Mr. Ferry, at 2:45 p. in. went into executive session and five minutes later adjourned to Monday. Houhb. Mr. Baker, from the Committee on Appropriations, reported the fortification appropriation bill and it was ordered printed and recommitted. It appropriates $100,000 for the protection and repair of fortifications, $400,000 for the armament, etc., of fortifica tions and $50,000 for the purchase of torpe does. 1 The House then resumed consideration of the Senate concurrent resolution relative to the electoral count. Mr. McLane, after read ing the twelfth article of the Constitution, said it gave an express grant to both houses of Congress to count the votes. He doubt ed whether many men on the other side would take the position, of Mr. Robeson, that the power to count the votes is - vested in the vice Jfresiusnt bv -the Constitution : that the theory has never been seriously accepted in the history of the country. Nor could the theory be ac cepted that Congress could constitute a tri bunal to count and declare the result of the electoral votes for President and Vice Presi dent. Congress did once by law establish a tribunal, and the count made under it would stand as a monument of disgrace. That tri bunal, McLane argued, was established after pressure because the country had an Execu tive who proposed to use the army and navy even to defeat the will of the people. It was under such a pressure that the gentlemen agreed to pass that law. But nearly all men of any distinction expressed regret that they should be called on to vote for such a law establishing such an exception al President, and authorized another body to perform a duty which devolved on the two houses of Congress. As a proof that the authority of the two houses of Congress to count the votes had been heretofore recog nized, Mr. McLane referred". to the fact that Mr. Lincoln in a message to Congress remon strated against being called upon to share the responsibility of declaring the result of the presidential election. That message was one of the acts which the gentleman from New Jersey would like to wipe out. Mr. McLane then made a long argument to show that un der article 12 of the Constitution the two houses counted the vote. A long and tedious discussion ensued as to the operation of the proposed joint rule in reference to its action on the vote of States, the Republicans contending that under the proposed rule one house really determined the result in each State ; while the Democrats argued that it required the concurrent action of both houses to receive or reject a vote, and that they regarded it as the fairest solu tion ofjthe question. Mr. Lapham, ofjNew York, expressed the belief that the Democrats had some ulterior object or they would not press this matter with such pertinacity. He gave notice that he would resort to all parliament ary expedients to defeat it. He insisted upon the right of the Vice President to - count the vote, claiming that no Vice President would ever defeat the will of the people. He did not regard it as possible to count a fraudu lent vote. In the course of his remarks he referred to the quotation by the Democrats of Mr. Lincoln's message on this subject, and intimated that they had no right to quote Mr. Lincoln, as they had regarded him as a mere rail splitter. Mr. Herbert, of Alabama, in reply denied that there was the least occasion to impute ulterior or bad objects to the Democrats. Me admitted the election of General Garfield, but said the Democrats wanted to establish the fact that the Vice President should not count the vote. Referring to Mr. Lapham's re mark about Mr. Lincoln's message, ha claimed that no section of the country had more re spect for Mr. . Lincoln's memory than the South, and they regarded his assassination as one of the greatest evils that could have be fallen that section. Mr. Newbury, of Michigan, closed the day's debate, arguing in favor of the right of the Vice President to count the vote, and at the close of his speech the House adjourned. UEW 

YORK. The Combination Against Kelly Politi cal Circles in a Stew. New Yokk, Dec. 9. The excitement in political circles over the combination to con firm the heads of departments to-morrow at the meeting of the Board of Aldermen con tinued unabated to-day. The City Hall pre sented a Evely appearance and all tbe prom inent politicians of both factions were dis cussing the latest information. The friends of Mr. Kelly seemed in better spirits than yesterday and were willing to wager even terms that the combination had been broken. The Republican leaders are not agreed over the combination and held a caucus this after noon to decide whether the combination will be kept or not. It is stated on good authori ty that Mayor Cooper will not include among his nominations to-morrow a candidate for Comptroller out of courtesy to Mr. Kelly. The Mayor has intimated that he will hold back for a week or so the nomination of a candidate for the Coniptrollership. Those opposed to Kelly say that a combination in some shape or other will be formed and suc cessfully, notwithstanding whtt is said. The wnole thing rests on the action of the Repub lican caucus.

The Number in Jail During the Year- Causes of Arrest Nativity of Prisoners Receipts and Expenses. The annual report of the County Commis sioners was completed and signed by them yesterday, and a copy will be forwarded to the Secretary of State. The document is one that will be read with interest. It will be seen that the debt of the county has been re duced $1,000 since the last report, when the balance on hand was only $77.91. The bal ance remaining in the treasury is $1,524.20, which is also a manifest gain over that re ported on hand one year ago. With a few years of such efficient management the coun ty will be freed from debt. Following is the report, which ends with November 30, 1880 :
