PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES Whatever the difference of opinion that may ex ist as to the subject-matter of President Wilson's an nual me- age to Congress, there must be unanimity on one point, namely, its brevity: and in brevity there is much virtue, whether it deals with spoken or writ ten word.- Presidential messages to Congress have never been remarkable for the penurious use of words. Or. the contrary, for most part, they have been ex haustive to the point of exhaustion. One of the mes sages sent to Congress by President Taft used up some 25.000 words. President Roosevelt. a3 might be expected, was given to prolixity of expression, al though what he said usually had a "punch" in it. President Cleveland's messages were inclined to pre penderosity. yet they were admirable state papers, ard he was besides a coiner of words and given to resurrecting pharases that had fallen into "innocuous desuetude." Roosevelt, too. showed facility in digging into .musty tomes in order to find expressions that would attract instant attention, and he is still prolif ic in digging out of the literary grists of the past words and phrases intended to confound his enemies hv their ant aDDlication. McKinley's messages to Congress were seldom of unusual length, and they contained none of the um brageous ornamentation and phrases that have served the purposes of others. And yet his messages were models of clearness and excellent diction. President Wilson is, without doubt, the greatest master of words in the I'nited States today, and they are not "weasel" words, as some of his critics would have us believe. His public speeches and his mes sages to Congress show a clarity of speech and a hu man nerspective that iiave been seldom equaled, at least by any modem statesman: and it cannot be truthfully charged against him that he is verbose in either, for. however people may differ as to the opin ions expressed, the President's speeches end messages to Congress contain food for thought and, for the most part, tersely expressed. Many speakers and writers, though they be eloquent, indeed, fail to remember that "Words are but leaves, aud where they most abound. Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found." President Wilson's recent message to Congress was directed wholly to domestic subjects, principally the problem of railroad legislation. It was not to be expected that he would deal in a message of this kind with the many international problems that have devel oped as a result of the European war. These are too complex and frequently of too delicate a nature to be discussed in detail in a message to Congress; and there is nothing to be gained by a mere reference to them. The United States has its own domestic problems to solve, including railroad legislation, and the President has clearly stated his position. Labor's rights are co-equal with the rights of employers of labor, but they are not paramount, and the President has not lost sight of the fact, so far as the interests ] of the public are concerned and that railroad em- < ployees should not be permitted to paralyze railroad < transportation without first exhausting every means j afforded by conciliation and arbitration. Legislation t placing the railroads and their employees directly i under the direction of the President, in case of strikes, t will no doubt be enacted at this session of Congress. 1 __________ .

SEEING EYE 3 o In an eastern educational publication we read that v an educator who wanted to find out how much first- t hand knowledge his pupils possessed, lately sent them 0 a list of questions, of which the following are a few: F "How many segments are there in the w bodies of flies and spiders, and to which of j, them are tho legs attached?" "Do the V's on the face of a clock point toward the center or the rim?" "Is the convexity or the concavity of the p new moon toward the sun?" C( "Do vines twist the same way as the hi threads of a screw, or the opposite way?" n "What are the first flowers of spring and m the last of autumn.'" to "Is dew deposited on clear, cloudy or h: windy nights?" th "Which hoofs are on the ground when a ar horse walks, trots, canters and paces?" pi "Do birds ever come back to their old th nests?" w "Why do shoes creak, and why does shoe blacking shine when rubbed with a shoe brush?" to Few adults can answer all these questions, pe and such answers as they are able to give are, in wt many cases, the result of reasoning. Robert Louis Stevenson somewhere speaks of Wj the seeing eye and.gives evidence of his own powers of observation by attributing It -to un uneducated man. It has often been remarked that the hnblt of reading fiction tends to dull the memory and that the use of books of reference betrays us all into distrusting our own knowledge. Yet the business man, or the pro fessional man, has even more need than the woods man or the former to see all that passes around him, register It automatically and retain It in momory. Facts which at first seem trivial often take on, in the quickly shifting course of life, the utmost im portance. It Is well worth patient training to culti vate the seeing eye. Uecently a mother in an Alaskan town, whose invalid son, aged eight, had not been taught to read, was reproached for the fact by a friend whoso son had learned to read at four. Her defense was that her boy had learned the habit of seolng and question ing every thing that came his way; she clinched the argument by asking what the other lad had read in his four years. Nothing but boys' books, of course. WAGES AND CAMPAIGN CRIES Tl?o Steel Trust may not be aware of the fact, but its action in raising the wages of 200,000 employees has given the lie to the late lamented Republican campaign. That campaign, state in its simplest form, was an effort to scare the people into voting for Hughes. From stump and platform, from billboard and street car. from advertising page and editorial column, the Republican National Committee shrieked its claim that the re-election of Wilson would bring disaster and that only the triumph of Hughes and the restoration of ancient tariff schedules could save the country from a terrible panic. Part, a singularly large part, of the voters were misled by this clamor, but enough remained sane to return Mr. Wilson to the White House?and promptly the Steel Trust, greatest of the Hughes-supporting in terests. shows how much it fears panic by adding $20,000,000 to its yearly pay roll. As if this were not enough, the Cotton Mill Trust of New England gratis a similar increase to its 33,000 operatives. It ought to be a cold, cold day before Republican calamity howling deceives any one again. Another chance for a good bet would be, who is the hardest loser. Chairman Willcox or Candidate Hughes? Roosevelt hasn't congratulated Wilson yet, but maybe he's waiting for the letter of thanks which the President owes him. With the thermometer fifty degrees below, the Republicans of the Fourth certainly received something more than a frost. Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink, may now be changed in Fairbanks by coal, coal everywhere but not a chunk to burn. The Rankin" Republican is Miss Jeanette, not Un cle Joe Cannon. | Mr. Wilson's success has been attributed to almost j everything and why may it not be due to Mr. Wilson? : It would be interesting to know what Roosevelt and Hughes really think of each other.
