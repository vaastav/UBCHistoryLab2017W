COAST DEFENSES tt f < The recent letter of MrTilden to Speaker Carlise on the matter of coast f defenses has created a universal interest 1 in the matter Very recently MajorGen i 4 eral John Newton Chief of the Engineers i l1 of the United States Army has been 1 I giving his views on the letter and itssub is ject to the New York Sun General 1 i Newton is of the opinion that Mr Tilden r I 3 4 has studied the subject thoroughly A and that the conclusion Mr Tilden reaches cannot be disputed At pres l ent the outer line of fortifications I i J of New York are about seven miles from I t the city says General Newton but these I fortifications are not yet properly armed f 1 In response to the question as to the it J range of the biggest guns he said it was t about thirteen or fourteen miles but that ui the practical range on shipboard would S be l much less owing lo the impossibility cf giving a high elevation and the danger 10 me decks 01 the snips if they could j accomplish it From this it appears that while the range of the guns is great yet the difficulties in the wity of taking ad VL vantage of that range on shipboard are so great as to materially lessen the range I General Newton is of opinion that guns i of the greatest capacity can be made in this country as well as in Europe He is also of opinion that if our harbors were put in a state of defense on the plans now contemplated and in accordance with scientific principles that such defense I would be complete for many years to 1 I come as improvements in the art of war j i in the future will 1 u I be very gradual t q and will not revolutionize by any I sudden increase the scale of velocities now given to projectiles So long has our country been at peace with the world that the people have been lull d into a false security and from this the country seems now to be gradually awakening The j important fact is forgotten that to put the j j i chief ports of the country in a proper j i state of defense years in place of months j would be required As General Newton i j say Let it be well understood that the i I modern system is to make war sudden sharp and decisive and to make the beaten party pay expenses And in j this connectionit would also be welt to I I remember that since 18CS the Govern I ment has spent 75000000 to build and repair the American navy and today the American navy stands without a rival in naval supremacy because the United i States have no navy For this condition I i of affairs the country is indebted to the Republican part On the value of Yankee inventive I genius Jn case of an emergency Gen I eral Newton puts a proper estimate i Should however the evil day come to j find without modern guns without suf ficiency of torpedoes without fortifications except the sand heaps which form the staple quotation without emplacement for the guns if we had them or magazines or machinery for unloading or man uvring or any facil ities whatever for shelter of guns or canon eers against shells and machine guns it is to be feared we would not cordially welcome the prophet Who having opposed timely preparation promised that in the supreme I moment when the hostile ironclads what I ever their strength and power should ap proach the harbor of New York they would I be turned back somehow without explain I ing how by Yankee energy Ynnlree skill Yankee inventive genius It is to be feared that the first flash of the monster guns would dissipate this oratorical vapor emitted when the danger was far offhand leave the deluded hearer to realize the fate of the blind who follow the blind DAKOTAS CASE The Territory of Dakota is seeking ad mission to the Union To her admission there is much objection Much of the opposition to the admission of new States into the Union is based upon theories an tagonistic to the true genius of the Ameri can Government Much of this opposi tion comes from the people of the older States who feel a jealousy of the power of the new States in the Senate In that body the voice of Nevada is as potent i H u T TL and as the voice of New York this is so because of the Federal idea which underlies the American Government The Senators are represen tatives of the States and not of the people In the East the papers are citing the cases of Oregon Nevada and Colorado to show the impolicy admitting new States with a meagre population Dakotas case is entirely different in that respect from the others Her population is estimated to be nearly half million and this estimate is probably no exaggeration In 1880 her population numbered 135177 while her present population is estimated upon the basis of the votes cast at the November election 1884 In 1884 the vote was 80764 and as this vote represented the male part of the population who had attained to a ma jority this vote counting each vote as being 1 to 5 of the actual population would show the actual number of inhab itants to be 433820 Such a population is perfectly able to support the burdens of Statehood and there is no danger of that population growing less for Dakota is preeminently an agricultural Territory its chief element of wealth being its wheat crop To divide Dakota and admit her as two States would be un wise and it is safe to say will not be done but as she is today she is entitled to admission to the Union Da kota is the only Territory in the Union whose Supreme Court is composed of six Judges By the way what has become Utahs constitutional convention 1 Is itnot about time for it to hold another semiannual conference I 

HUMANITARLANS Justus Schwab the New York Socialist has expressed himself on the merits of the San Francisco fiends He thinks and says they were inspired by the most hu manitarian motives If such is the case then well may humanity cry aloud Save me from my friends Schwab doesnt know these four dynamiters but he wel comes them as true Socialists Whether people welcome them as Socialists or not they will certainly recognize them as such and the recognition will not please them either Schwab draws the line of tlie universal i l brotherhood at the Chinese I e This is reassuring and reminds one of Ko Ko when he drew the line at YumYum These four San Francisco dynamiters and all such as they should have the line of the hangman drawn around them They are entirely too plentiful and on every occasion they wish to reorganize society by universal murder This may be humanitarianism but it is in a form which will not be acceptable to most I people We hope the California officers will give these four heroic boys a life i I lease in San Quentin I Tildens Letter on Seacoast Defenses I Mr Tilden has rendered the country a timely and important service in his let ter urging Congress to take up the mat ter of seacoast defenses Addressing himself formally to Speaker Carlisle but in fact to Congress Mr Tilden appears as the advocate of national sovereignty and national defense and he tenders the Congressmen of all parties eminently sound advice when he admonishes them that to leave our vast interests defense less in order to reduce the cost of whisky to its consumers would be a solecism Adequate national defense is a matter of much greaterimportance to the country than a reduction of revenue The tax on Avhisky may be left where it is and the accumulating Treasury surplus wisely used to supply proper seacoast defenses The United States is apparently con I vinced that all offensive weapons have been beaten into ploughshares and prun ing hooks while the lion and the lamb have lain down together with the lamb i outside the lion and that this happy j I i state of affairs will 1 continue for all time to come Ve are in the position of I j a I i wealthy man who would leave his doors j I unlocked and unbarred with his 1 1 money and valuables in plain sight and open to the attack every robber With eno J enor i i mous wealth concentrated in the seaport j cities these places are exposed to the at j tacks of any of the naval powers and the j nation is powerless to save them from I I plunder As Mr Tilden says a million I soldiers stationed on the heights sun 1 rounding the harbor of New York could 1 j not protect that city from destruction by a small squadron of war steam I ers armed with long range guns and the only recourse would be to open the 1 i banks and money vaults and pay what I i over ransom might be demanded From Galveston to Portland every seaport is in I the same condition With the new de I vices for removing torpedoes heavy war Yesse1mi htmake their way up to Wash1 I I Hngton and Philadelphia and put those places under tribute A firstclass vessel I I might come up the lakes without effective oppOsition an levy a ransom on Detroit I j Milwaukeg oiTChicaso It is simply matter of conjecture how long this state I of affairs may continue to tempt the cupidity even of secondrate naval powers without bringing on an attack General Grant once said that the best I way of preserving peace was to be pre pared for war Twenty years ago the I coast fortifications of the principal sea l ports in the United States re adapted to the methods of naval warfare at that time and our vessels carried guns of the heaviest calibre j but since then the in vention of the Krupp gun has put the Rodmanout of date and made outforts and vessels defenceless All the other naval powers have the great steel guns I that enable them to raze a city at a d s tance of seven or eight miles They fire with ten times the velocity reached by the potmetal guns of the United States navy and a modern war vessel could raze one of our forts without getting in range of its cannon Likewise United States manofwar would be blown up before it could get within shooting distance The United States invites attack by being wholly unprepared for a naval war To replace the potmetal cannon with modern steel guns would be a work of years but that certainly is one of the strongest reasons why should be begun at once These guns cannot be manu factured in the United States and at first they would have to be obtained in Eng land and Germany If the Government would make a cohtract for a sufficient number of the guns a plant of machinery could be secured for their manufacture in the United States j but as the business would have to be built up from the ground it would be at least five or six years before the first gun could be turned outin thiscountry But the Gov ernment ought to secure some of these guns for the defense of the principal sea ports at the earliest practicable day The expense of course will be very heavy but adequate seacoast defense is a necessity and it would be the height of folly to de lay making provision for it until too late This is n g od 4 forCngres trc a good time Congress to re assert the American doctrine and vote the necessary millions for defense rather than incurthe danger tributes and na tional humiliation Chicago Tribune A Reporters Valuable Suggestion The Rev T DeWitt Talmage when in town the other day said that he owed much of his success in life to the sugges tions of a newspaper reporter He was engaged to lecture in Baltimqre several years ago and just before he was to be gin his discourse the newspaper man who had been sent to report the the ad dress inquired in an offhand way Well Dr Talmage are you going to give us many points tonight Points repeated the clergyman Points Yes replied the reporter you wont get much space tomorrow unless your lecture is full of good points that the paper cant afford to leave out I thought very deeply over the report ers words said Dr Talmage in telling the story and I saw that they were full of sound wisdom Since that time I have always endeavored to make my lectures and sermons and literary work bristle with pointsthat is to say with strik ing thoughts and phrases t Not Afraid of the Dynamiters The citizens who were down on the dynamiters list for assassination have unanimously declined to be frightened Persons of the class to which these con spirators belong have an altogether erroneous estimate of the courage of the aristocrat and bourgeoisie in America Instead of turning pale and trembling at the thought of the midnight underground giantpowderloaded Socia list the threatened gentlemen evince a lively desire to get a chance to break the heads of the conspirators who had doomed them to death These people think said Mr Spreckels one of the condemned to a Post reporter yesterday that because a man has money he must be afraid of his life My life is worth no more to me than anybody elses and I would be just as willing to go in and fight as anybody These bilks wont work and they wont fight I shouldnt be afraid of twenty of them The average Ameri can rich or poor has ample faith in his ability to take care of himself And he can usually do it tooS F Post y Old Black Joe Dead A Dallas Texas dispatchof December 10th says Joe Parker colored died to day at the county poor farm at the ageof 120 years Nicodemus the Slave was his favorite melody and his dying words were Wake me for the great jubilee He L was u m ji slave for a century most of the time in Tennesseewhere he was fortunate in having kind masters The proclama tion of emancipation came too late to be of any particular service to poor Joe who for many years before his death had be come too feeble to take care of himself and who has since then either enjoyed i chic freedom of the city calihoose or of the county poor farm It was old Joe who furnished the ideal of Milt Barlow in his characteristic song of Old Black Joe in Memphis many years ago These United States I This is a common but erroneous form of expression says an exchange Wise I educated and national men use it It is a remnant of state sovereignty of seces sion of confederacy It brings up mem ories of evil bloody sickening days It drags before the present the bloodstained history of the past There is no such thing as these United States There is such a thing as this United States j and it is a great Nation always to be spelled with a big N Uncle Sam is proprietor of the ranch The Company Needed

has been so much overlooked as that relating to physical culture Thera can be no ex cuse for this on the part of intelligent parents and teachers And especially is there no excuse for neglect to take ample outdoor exercise in a climate like ours in Utah Wishing to call the attention and thought of the readersof the 

DEMO CRAT to this vital subject we subjoin the following taken from the New York Her ald A man without muscle is as badly off in this rough and tumble world as a man without brains Parents take pride in their children when their heads are packed like a pawnbrokers shop with all i sorts of odds and ends of information I but they do too little to encourage the symmetrical development of their bodies They forget that robust health consti tutes about threequarters of the problem of human happiness and that it is crimi nal neglect of the highest welfare of the boy and girl to keep them at their books until they lose all appetite for out of door sports Half the men in the world are broken down with dyspepsia and the other half are broken up with rheumatism The women who are not suppose to have any muscles indulge in the luxuries ot SICK headache and neuraliga A half hours vigorous exercise in the morning before I the business of the day begins a brisk walk of a dozen miles would sweeten the temper and make life worth living Such is our physical condition however that if you should turn a number of ordinary citizens into a gymnasium for an hours torture with the parallel bars and fifty pound dumb bells and the inspirating trapeze you would have to pick them up from the floor like chestnuts under a tree after a gale of wind Our clerks and their employers also three hours on a hard road with a leap here and there over a fence or ditch would have to be brought home in furniture wagons and a large proportion of them deposited at the undertakers We have not yet learned the secret of right living No man lives well who does not send hours every day out of doors We are asthmatic rheumatic spleeny and hard to get along with at home because we believe in brains and not in
