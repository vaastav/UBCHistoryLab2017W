The following testi mony elicited will give an Idea of tho Maa : tTharle* M. Chambers sworn.—l saw the prisoner, Scott, one night, four or five weeks 1 Mince, at a dance at (Canterbury Hall. A friend and myself got into a dispute there, when the j priwner approached us and represented him- | *Mf a* a United States detective. I remarked. " Well, if you are a detective, I hope yon will lei us out of here." He "Oh y»vs, 1 wIU pass you out -, but a crowd assembled in front of aa, and I drew a small knife ami threatened to stick some or them if they did not let us pass. Wo finally succeeded in get ting ont, and some, two or three days after wards the prisoner had me arrested on a \ charge of attempting to take his life. The j Chief of Police dismissed the case as ex- ' aremely frivolous. A short time after this, the prisoner came to me nnd demanded of me flfiy dollars, stating that he wn.« a Govern ssent detective; that it was not his desire to have me arrested, but he had been obliged to j do tt; ihat It Was done by theordPr of Major Oroft, and that he could have sent me jJist where he plon*ed. He further stated that he was drawing $180 per month from the Govern ment. Parker Wescott sworn.—-I was in a buggy ] with Charles Chambers whan the prisoner bad him arrested. Hoard the prisoner say he was a United States detective, from New 'Or leans ; that Chambers had promised him fifty dollars for getting him off at the police office when he was arrested. James Ml 11 ward sworn .—I am one of the pro prietors of the Spotawood Hotel. Scott, the prisoner, stnyed ut the hotel during a part of October and November last. When he first oame there ho registered his name us Samuel W. Scott, sud look a room on tho second floor. Some two or three days afterwards he entered the office and Innnlred for one of the proprie tors. I Invited nlm In, and he made n state aa*nt. In effect, as follows: That he was a United States detective, from Now Orleans, end thst he was here for the purpose of reco- 1 verlng a quantity of Jewelry which bad been stolen ; that be was employed by the firm of ! Brutus Long k Co. to ferret the" matter out; that he did not know bnt he might lie detailed j hers some time, and asked whether I could not board him cheaper than I was doing. I in formed him that he might take a room on the apper floor for $73 per month, and he agreed to do it. He Was, I think, nt the house seven teen days, but has n»!Vt>f paid his lioard bill — About a Week after his arrival, Major Croft asked m» Whether I knew him or not. I then told the Major what Scott had stated to me. Und be expressed some distrust concerning his { giootrs) honesty. I then questioned Scott aboat his being a d*>tocttve, and he said he was here With OhO Of the chief detectives of Phtln talphla, named Franklin. After this, I tele graphed Deputy United States Marshal J. \ W. Sharkey, of Philadelphia, to loam whether j Scott's statement* were true or false. The an- | awer received (which is here produced) .was 1 that Franklin had not boon In Kichmond since 1 the evacuation. I then hail Scott arrested, and I requested him to show his authority for repre senting himself as a United St-it«>« detective.— He replied that he could not do so. It was in consequence of his representations that he was i a secret agent of the Government that I gave j him credit for his board. W. F. Corkery, the other proprietor of the Spot* wood, testified that ho was present when fne conversation occurred between Mr. Mill ward and tlie prisoner; that he was acquainted In New Orleans, and never heard of such a arm as Brutus Long k Co. Mr. Millward recalled.-^Scott owes the Spotswood Hotel a bill of forty dollars. Major J. N. Croft, Chief of Police, sworn.— Scott came to my office about the 80th of Octo ber and inn ulred whether I had received a trackage for nlm. I told him I had not, when te expressed much surprise, and went on to tell me that he was a United States detective,, from New Orleans, and was here on very im portant business ; that a firm there had been robbed of diamonds to a large amount, and that he was employed to ferret the matter out. He seemed to be well posted in regard to de tectives in the country. I subsequently learned that he was not what he claimed to be, and that be was obtaining credit about the city through his false representations. I then tele fraphed to New Orleans, and received n reply ro.n the Chief of Police of that city that no such man as Scott was employed on their de tective force. I then arrested him, and told him what I had learned ; that he was 110 de tective, and that he had been swindling people about here through his deceptions, when he voluntarily confessed that he had acted wrong, nnd was no detective. Judge McEntee then found the prisoner guilty of obtaining property by false pretences, and asked him It he had anything to say. Tho prisoner replied: "I nave been a United States detective, and was honorably dis charged. I came to this city and made a lying braggadocio of myself. I desire to thank Major Croft for hla kindness to me before and after bt arrest." Judge McEntee: "Well, sir, I sentence you to confinement nt hard labor in the Virginia penitentiary for the period of one year." ~ prisoner: "Very well, that is a lighter sentence than I expected." The prisoner was then taken away under guard.* _j Msvoa's Cocsv.—Mayor Saunders held his Court on Saturday morning at 11 o'clock, when the following cases were brought to his notice: Isabella Onld, charged with shooting H. H. Meade with intent to kill. This nffair oc curred some three months a<ro, nt a drinking saloon kept by tho parties on Franklin street, and was caused by Jealousy. Meade was se verely wounded, but now si-ems t«» have en tirety-recovered. Mrs. Ould appeared In Court quite fashionably attired, wearing a Jaunty hat, with any quantity of beads, bugles and lace. Several witnesses were caned for the Commonwealth, but the only ones who re- Sionded were R. H. Meade, I*l win Tyler nnd r. White. None of the witnesses for the de fence were present. Mr. Manuaduke Johnson, counsel for Mrs. Ould, seated that they had net had sufficient time to summon their wit nesses, whose presence was necessary in order that his client might have a fair hearing. He therefore asked a continuance of the cn«*. To this proposition the Mayor absented, and post poned the hearing until Thursday next. Mrs. Ould waa admitted to ball In the sum of $1,000, with William J. Brown and D. D. Farqnhar as sureties, and the witnesses for the Common wealth were recognised to appear. John T. West was charged with buying thirty-two law books, knowing the some to have been stolen. J. L. C. Danner, the only witness in the cane, was called, but failed to respond, and the Mayor postponed the hear ing until Monday, admitting the accused to hall la the sum of three hundred dollars, with Stephen Mason aa surety. D. D. Mott was charged with stealing a watch, valued at twenty dollars, from Mar shall Ames. The accused was formerly aa officer in the United State* army, and stationed in this city. Mr. Ames testified that, about the first of last month, be let Mott have the watch for the purpose of selling it; that two or three days afterwards, noticing thar Mott did not hare the watch, he questioned him, cad was MM that he had told It.

Policeman John Hornn testified to the facts hi lhe case, aa lie understood them, nnd stated that while be was endeavoring to keep Deb)- I rue quiet, about 1 o'clock In the morning, the latter called him a d-*d Yankee something not mentionable to ears polite. J. A. Owen*, a Witness for the defence, testified that Dolarue did not make a disturbance, nor use thephrase attributed to him by the policeman. Never ' theless the Mayor required security in the Mitn of three hundred dollars for his good be hnvior for twelve months.

For an hour previous to the com- j mencment of the exercises the members of j Sunday Schools were constantly arriving, and ] by the* time the meeting opened the body of the church Wn* crowded with bright and hap py looking children. The meeting was other- | wise largely attended. Mr. Asa Snyder pre- j sided, and the proceedings were opened with ■ Krayer, after which " The Beautiful Land of Bet " was sung.

Ja cob Manning, a well known and very pious minister of the Virginia Conference, who has , lately been appointed missionary to labor ex clnsivelv for the Sabbath school cause in the . city of Kichmond and its suburbs and in Man chester. This denomination has recently awakened to a lively sense of the importance , of this cause, and is putting forth extxaordi nary efforts to push It forward.. Mr. Manning. Ih his remarks, adverted to-the remarkable; scene before him—the bright faces and Beam- j lug eyes of the little boys and girls—as a beau tiful sight. He also spoke of the importance j of the missionary enterprise for which he had been selected. He should feel happy In going oat Into the highways and byways of the city to bring iii all the children to the Sunday school; but he urged the friends of the schools, . the officers and teachers, not to relax their ef forts, but to co-operat«;with him and labor as ( porscveringly as*they had ever done before for the good of the cause. After the close of Mr. Manning's remarks, • a collection was taken up to aid the cause, and twenty life members were made by 11n payment oY ten dollars each—making a lotal of two hundred doilars. Th»- m«v>tln|f warn also addressed by the I»ev. John E. Edwards, who urg«»d the member- o« , the Union to perseverJag efforts to push for- j ward the cause. He congratulated the associ ation that they had a good President, a good missionary and such liberal friends. Alluding to the statistics presented, he said the forty two conversions reported for the month among the scholars was an interesting fact, and he earnestly hoped that during the com ing year God would more abundantly than ever* bless the schools. The Exercises were interspersed with the singing of beautiful hymns, eon duo ted, by the Sabbath School of Clay Street Church, and ! performed in a very creditable manner. | The interest of the meeting was kept up until a late hour In the afternoon, when the children aad their friends dispersed with a feeling of i renewed attachment to the cause. Much good, we are assured, will result from the workings j of the Methodist Sunday School Union. j The neat meeting will be held on tho second Sunday la January, at half-past two o'clock la the afternoon, with the Manchester Sabbath School.

Spoimbo a Sbatiso Posh—Oa Saturday , I last the water was drawn from the pond lying ! north of Broad street, just beyond Trinity Church. It appears that the boys had stopped ' up the culvert with, the view of making a good skating pond, and the water rose to siuli a height that it threatened to overflow its banks. Accordingly, the county authorities ordered aa I " abatement of the nuisance," which was done, as above stated. A teat had to be pro- ; cured to approach und break open ihe culvert. j The boys lament the loss of their pond, though I they think the •* suspension " will be only tern- ; porary. To-oav the Hustings Conrt of the city of | Richmond holds a session at the City Hall. Among the first cases to occuny its attention will doubt fees be that of Mrs. Kirby, who was recently sent on for examination on the charge of killing her husband, Robert F.

There seems to be a determina tion to stand by the President among the Re publicans in Congress. His message has given such general satisfaction aa to secure him the confidence even of those who do not agree to all his suggestions.

The Choir introduced tho aervtceaby staging "Glory to God In the Highest oa Earth, Pence and fOood WIU to Men." Beai John Young than offered prayer, mad stated The ob ject of the meeting, and upon calling for an organisation! appropriate to the occasion, the followingo/Bcers ware elected, via: Hamilton Pope, President; General J. T. Boyle, Hob. p. B. Mulrand Hon. W. F. Barrett, Vice- Presidents, and Rev. R. Morrow, Secretary. After the congregation had united in singing, stirring addresses were delivered by Rev. J. D. McKee, Rev. John C. Young, city pastors ; Hamilton Pope, General Boyle, Hon. W. F. Barrett nnd others. Letters were read from Rev. E. P. Hum phrey, D. D., and Rev. R. G. Brank, heartily endorslng the Board and expressing an earnest desire to promote its success by active co-ope ration. An appeal was now made to the audi ence to demonstrate their earnestness in this cause, which was responded to in a spirited manner, resulting in a few minutes' tions to the amount of ai.ooo. This was highly* gratifying, as the work has bnt fairly com- Kced, and testifies that the hearts of this de are truly in the work of relieving the destitution of their brethren from all quarters of the State. Reports come to the Board that the Presbyterians are fuUy awakened to the importance of immediate action, and a liberal support is confidently hoped for. The Board have perfected all the arrangements necessary to effect a prompt distribution of the funds to its hands. After singing the doxology, " Praise God from whom all blessings flow,*' the congregation dispersed, while the choir sang "Haydn's Hallelujahs to the God of Israel." Thus closed one of the most harmonious nnd interesting occasions in the history of the Press byterians in this city. Troubles among the Fenians. New Yobb, December !♦.—At the session of | the Senate of tho Fenian Brotherhood, held in Now York on the 7th Instant, articles of im peachment were filed against John O'Mahony, President of the Brotherhood, for perfidy and malfeasance in ofl&ce.

Mr. O'Mahony having taken no steps to meet tho indictment against him, the Senate to-day resolved itself Into a Court of Judicature, according to the provisions of their Institution, and having investigated the charges, declared them proved, and deposed O'Mahony from the position of President. A unanimous vote was then passed calling on the Viec-Presldent, Mr. W. R. Roberts, to qualify by taking the oath of office, on which that gen- j tteanam was eworn Into office, stipulating be- j forehand that no compensation should be at- | tachedtotheposltlonwhileheoccupledlt. The Secretary of the Treasury, R. D. Klllan,has also been deposed on grounds similar to those advanced against Mr. O'Mahony. An address to the Circles has been issued by the Senate and forwarded by mail. 1 The Test Oath-Southern Members— Interesting Wedding. j Waphibotob, December 9.—lt is understood I I the constitutionality of the act of Congress presenting the test oath is now before- the Su- j preme Court In tho appUcation of A.
