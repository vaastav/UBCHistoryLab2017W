THE MESSAGE. * The message of President McKinley is conservative, clear and non-sensa tional. There is nothing in it to cre ate alarm, or awaken distrust in the ability of the administration to conduct the affairs of the Government safeiy and prosperously. The three matters of greatest impor tance in the document are the Cuban and Hawaiian questions, and the affairs of the Government Treasury. Con cerning the first the President stands ference with the Cuban war, except so far as to make strong and respectful appeals to close the unhappy struggle and secure peace to the island that Will be honorable to Spain and give to the Cubans the measure of freedom and home rule to which they are en titled. He expresses the belief that these ends may be secured and points to the changed attitude of the Spanish Gov ernment and the recent declaration of the Spanish Cabinet, In which the new policy for Cuba is outlined that the I'resident believes will or should result in the institution of reforms giving In this connectievn he argues at length Government should recognize the bel- Ifgerency of the insurgents and insists that such recognition would not only be disadvantageous to the Cubans, but would be unfortunate for American in terests. So far as recognition of Cuban independence Is concerned, he declares that the point has not yet been reached that will, under the laws of nations, justify puch recognition, and to that end as well as upon the question of rec < gnltlon of belligerency, he quotes lengthily from the message of President Grant in 1875. Throughout ail these! expressions there flows a strong current of sympathy for Cuba, and emphatic denunciation of the policy of Spain under the Weyler regime, which he contrasts with the milder, more hu mane and manly administration of the present Oaptain-Genera". The attitude of the President con cerning Cuba will not please the radi cal friends of the insurgents, nor find sympathy among the very large body of American citizens who hold that rec ognition cf the bvll«g- rency of tlv insur gents should be given. The President will command respect, however, for the courage he manifests in facing so stT-ong a sentiment among his fellow countrymen who disagree with Lim regarding our Cuban policy. Cer tainly no one will be found to phargs upon him insincerity in tb's regard or lack of deep conviction and sound pa triotism. Concerning Hawaiian annexation the martter is dismissed with a very few words, but they are positive and un mistakable, and evince trust in the 8-snate that the annexation treaty will i.>e ratified. As to the currency ques tion he comes forward in a strong de fence of the policy of President Cleve servation of the gold reserve. As he ing in gold, but is compelled to redeem at all times in gold. So long as that policy is forced upon the Administra tion he declares that it must and will continue to borrow to maintain the gold resorve. He condemns this policy, declares it to be uneconomic and unpatriotic, and tain definite plans, more fully 6et out in the report of the Secretary of th.' Treasury*, to which he refers with an prrvul. He would have the currency, so long as redeen tale 10 gold paid out as gold. National banks should be of the tax upon such issue he would limit their notes to §10 minimum and all national banks should be required to redeem In gold. These matters must be taken up tor consideration separately later on. and examined at length. At present we can only paus* to say that we believe that the country will concur in the con tention of the President that it is most an economic and unwise to continue a policy that compels the Government to furnish all the gold required for ex changes and export. There is nothing in all this that sug gests the slightest fear in the mind of the President that the new revenue system will fail to produce the income necessary for the support of the Gov ernment. On the contrary he expresses the faith that it will, but adds that as yet not sufßeb nt time has elapsed to en able the new system to develop its full possibilities. Expression is made that the scheme of the Monetary Commission is not complete, and that whatever the out come the Administration has faithfully kept its pledge to do all that within it lies, to bring about an international agreeim nt concerning the relations of gold and silver. There is strong recommendation of in crease of our naval strength both in ships and men, and that at least one more battleship shall be provided for the Pacific Coast. He pronounces for the Nicaragua canal and for assertion of the purpose of the Government to secure from the sale of the Kansas Pa cific Railway the full dues of the Gov ernment. The President strongly urges such legislation and activity as are necessary to further the increase of our foreign trade through reciprocity and the fostering by legislation of our foreign commerce. The message will be well received by the great mass of the American peo ple, since it is frank, not equivocating, is easily understandable, and is vigor ous in assertion of the policy of the Administration. From political op ponents it will have adverse criticism on the ground that it defends a revenue system which they insist is not a sufficient revenue producer. The more conservative of the people will find the message fair minded, honest expres sion, and generally wise, though the more ardent friends of the Cuban cause will not fail to voice their regrets, that the President's views of international law are not in accord with their hopes and desires. 

SPAIN'S CUBAN PLAN. If all else claimed for it io conceded, the autonomous proposition of Spain to Cuba will be rejected, because the judicial system and the management of :.he revenues are to be kept under the thumb of Spain. "Without control of the courts, home Government," cay the Cubans, "will be a farce. If we are not capable of ad ministering a judicial system above the jurisdiction of petty' magistrates, we are fit only to be slaves," they add. Spain in her new plan about to be promulgated by Captain-General Blan co, reserves the right in her own inter est to maintain a differential duty in her favor, until her industries are re habilitated. When that is accomplish ed, say the new Ministry, all tariff matters will be turned over to the Cu bans. The point of objection is that this promise is indefinite. It is left to Spain to declare when, in some far distant future, she no longer needs differential protection. It may be fifty and it may be a hundred years hence, and it may be so far beyond the present as to be a hollow promise of relief. Practically, the Cubanis are certain of nothing as regards tariff regulation if they lay down their arms upon the promise thus made by Spain. But this is not all. Spain proposes that as to minor magistrate's the islanders shall have free sway, but as to anpc-llate tribunals they must be content with what Spain sends over or selects from among residents of Cuba. tice what are practically foreign courts are to be the administrators in Cuba- Still further objections are raised to the SO-eaUed autonomous plan, that It provides that the navy and the army are to be under the control of Spain. Cuba is to have a Legislature, it is true. and to legislate concerning local af fairs, v.ith the right of absolute veto reposed in the representative of the crown resident in Cuba. This seems to the Cubans hollow also, since with leg^!at : on thus hampered, Spain will have the power to prevent the exercise of real home Government. Finaily, while Cuba is to be given it will be so small as to be ineffective. Cuba concedes that she could not ex pect a majority in the Cortes, and does not ask it, but she does wish to be independent of legislation in the na tional body, have power to set up a home Governor with a Cabinet and the usual Ministries, and the right to main tain and discipline the militia, all which is denied in the autonomous plan D W pjosented f<_r Cuban acceptance. We can understand very easily why Cbs Cubans raise the objections to the scheme that they do—they have twice tried Spain on her promises of reform, and in each cao-e has found her to be untrustworthy. They have reasons tn ; ttfty to suspect that th<-> new promises The "Sketch" tells of an unnamed but vigorous literary critic who defends the split infinitive with great valor, claim tag, despite the purists who abhor and split infinitive is essential to the vigor of the national speech.

SACRAMENTO BADLY RECORD-UNION, WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 8, 1897. VOICE OF THE PRESS. EXTRACTS FROM EDITORIAL EXPRESSION. ! State and Coast Opinions on Sub jects of Living News Interest. San Jose Herald: In Denver several grocers have been indicted for selling oleomargarine. Why should they not sell it, provided it is not under false pretenses? If any one prefers oleomar garine to butter, quality and price con sidered, he should have the right to buy v unhindered by law. Any dealer who sells oleomargarine for butter should be punished for selling goods un der false pretenses, just as in the case of any other one guilty of that offense. But to make it more particularly Ille gal to sell oleomargarine than anything else is an unjust discrimination against an xrticie of merchandise that should have Jus* the same rights as others. AN OBJECT LESSON. San Diego Union: Punishment of of fenders against the election laws is rare, jpo it is encouraging to note the recent sentencing of an election officer in Philadelphia for making a false re turn, to a fine of $">OO, to suffer an im prisonment of nine months, to be dis qttalilied from office-holding for seven years, and to be deprived of the right to vote for four years. This is an ob ject lesson which ought to play its part as-a warning to all persorts who may be called upon to act as election officers. In this instance the punishment was imposed for an offense committed at the lecent election, and, therefore, all the exemplary influence of a trial and a conviction speedily following the com mission of the crime seems to have been attained. It now remains to be seen whether the good effects of this object lesson will be speedily counteracted by a pardon. THE PHYLLOXERA AGAIN. San Jose Mercury: While a crop of twenty million gallons of wine this year would seem to indicate that the phylloxera, concerning the ravages of which so much has been said from time to time, is doing no particular harm among the vineyards of Califor nia, it is a generally recognized fact that this enemy of the vine is steadily spreading, and that if left alone it will in time destroy every viney-ard in the State. Happily the grape-growers have the remedy in their own hands, and by planting resistant vines as the occasion demands they can gradually re new their vineyards without materially decreasing in the meanwhile the aver age annual output of wine. That cer tain varieties of vines are immune from this disease is a fact which has been thoroughly established, but there is a difference of opinion among leading vineyardists concerning the most eco nomical method of substituting resist- A CAKE STORY.

Oh, of course! There never was a streaky, heavy, soggy, indigestible cake made but it was charged to some wo man—generally a bride. One would think the writers hatl never seen any I bakers' cakes. However, as the heav- I mess got into this cake by design and ! was intended to help prisoners to es cape 4, it. is good of the dispaches to give the credit for the clever scheme Ito a .voman. Of course, it was a man | that discovered the heaviness of the A HOWLING FARCE. Stockton Mail: The "Examiner" and I "Call" are engaged in an extremely [ lengthy and uintet esting controversy as to which is responsible for sending the Bear to the relief of the imprisoned whalers. We shrewdly suspect that when the course cf human events has demon strated that this whole relief affatir is I a howling farce, the esteemed eontem | poraries will make haste each to prove that the other got it up. It is a good bet that the "relief par | ty" will never get within a hundred I miles of the "imprisoned whalers." It is a sure bet that if the "relief party-" ever does reach the "imprisoned whal ers" It will find those astonished wor- I tlttes very comfortably enjoying them j selves and amiably anxious to take care of their forlorn rescuers. SUBDIVISION OF WEALTH. Portland Oregonian: The fact that vast aggregation of wealth in this country arc, as a rule, subdivided, and even scattered widely, upon the death of the men who have heaped them up, averts the. danger to our republic pre dicted by alarmists from the accumu lation of greait fortunes. These great fortunes are divided and subdivided constantly, split asunder, as it were, by the impact of the arrow of death"— as a reosnt writer puts it. He adds that a few years ago William H. Vanderbilt held in his hand about $800,000,000, but that ir. a moment that hand became ion. which is still going on. began. There InMng no law of entail in our country, fortunes are constantly shift ing hands, ami the rich family of one generation is likely to be impoverished in the next. \N FUROR ABOUT CLIMATE. Stockton Independent: Clergymen of ments and equally rash conclusions. At a recent meeting of Unitarian ministers in 3a:t Francisco, one of them gave voice to a conclusion that was exceed ingly rash, and does not appear to have od\aneed a single reason why he arrived at it. That conclusion is that the climate of California is calculated just the way he expressed it. but it nvans the same thing, Unitarian min iste-rs are generally men of thorough ecluca'ion, good reasoners and good gene-nlizers, but this man seems to be a glaring exception. What is Califor nia Climate? He talked as if he thought it was ail alike, whereas it varies more than the climate of any other State in Hie Union, and perhaps more than any other country in the world Stretch ing over nearly ten degrees, from near ly 12 to 42 north, the climate varies as much as that of the Atlantic States from Sav.ir.nnh. Oa., to Albany. N. Y. FATHER DUCKY'S PLAN". Oakland Enquirer: Father Ducey, a Catholic preacher in New York, who has been often to the front in recent years, has concluded a series of ser mons on social questions, and in the last one he remarks: "The great ques tion of our day which, according to Leo XIII., and the judgment of the best mlndf in the civilized world, demands immediate solution if our society and the republic are to be saved, is a blank sp' t in the minds of the people in so ciety." Anyone who talks about an "immediate solution" of the social question is verging on nonsense. Such I questions ay» not settled off-hand, but work themselves out by a process of gradual evolution. The race has been for thousands of years engaged in the solution of the social problem, and douotless it will be engaged on it for many more thousands of years. To quote Father Ducey again: "The pres ent social, economic and religious con dil one of the world are all wrong and exist in criminal contradiction to the teachings of Jesus Christ." "All wrong" is a very comprehensive term. If things were "all wrong" there wouid be no hope of reformation, since reformation is an evolutionary change from worse to better. Father Ducey should be sat isfied to say that things are partially wrong, or largely wrong. A GOOD SCHEME FOR THEM. Oakland Tribune: How vaudeville artists will hold up their heads in fu ture. Queen Victoria has stamped the seal of royal approval on them by hav ing a troupe appear before her at Windsor Castle. The advertisement the "stars" got means top-notch sala ries for them for awhile, because every showman will be after the performers that appeared "by order of the Queen." It looks as if some shrewd American advertising man is around that part of the country. HOW THEY* DIFFER. Fresno Republican: The English bi metailists are adding to the difficulties that are at present obstructing the way to an agreement by differing widely as to the proper ratio. One element stands by IU to 1, another prefers to 1, while still others btiieve that the best policy- would be to commit the move ment to a ratio approaching the com mercial value of silver. There is con servatism and safety in the latter pol icy, but it will be looked upon with dis favor by the free coinage advocates in this country, who contend that this Government alone can safely open its mints to the silver of the world at the present ratio. 

111-:STIIICTTNG IMMIGRATION. Tulare Register: It appears to be exceedingly probable that there will be decisive legislation at the coming ses sion of Congress in relation to shutting out undesirable immigration. That subject has been long before the peo ple and the time seems ripe for action, perhaps not as extreme action as some would like, but action that will keep from our shore the ignorant, the pau pers and the vicious and that is really all we want kept out. There is yet room in our country for millions of for eigners wiio wish to seek shelter and liberty under the folds of our starry banner, but we are already over crowd ed with those who seek only license, bad liquor and worse politics. It is right to discriminate. It is wrong not to. IT IS VERY TIRESOME. Santa Rosa Press-Democrat: When the Stockton "Mail" refers to the vain glorious "antics of the "Call" and the "Examiner" over that Bear relief ex pedition as a bowling farce, it just about his the nail on the head. It might go farther and say that the vast amount of space those great journals devote to sounding their own praises and revilrng each other is rapidly be coming very, very tiresome to the gen eral public. It is almost inconceivable that papers of their standing should fib their columns and exhaust their ener gies in this unseemly fashion, day after day. It may.be gratifying to the mil lionaires who own them, but it is bound to destroy much of the ponfidence the public reposes in those very enterpris ing papers. Such journalistic exhibi tions might do in the backwoods days of long ago, but something better is expected of metropolitan journalism of to-day. PRIMARY LAWS. Oakland Tribune: The Eastern States have all taken up the question of primary laws and at most of the com ing sessions of the Legislatures the matter will come up in the form of bills. One has already been prepared for New York and is modeled somewhat on the lines of the Stratton law in California, the most noticeable difference being that it is not required to have the pri maries all held the same day-. In the language of the bill: "In order that none- but Republicans shall tike part fn Republican primaries and Democrats in Democratic primaries, a system of registration shall be in force." The outlook for the measure is somewhat dubious, as the boss system is so pro nounced in that part of the country that it will find little difficulty in over ruling an Act aimed fsjfeotly at its power.

Mrs. Ruth McEnery Stuart writes for the December "St. Nicholas" a South ern sketch entitled "An Old-Time Christmas Gift." Mrs. Stuart begins her sketch as follows: Mimi was white and Yuyu was black, and they belonged to each other. Of Course these were not their real names; Mini was christened Euphemia. and Yuyu's name was Julia. The little girls were the same age. exactly: and on the very day they were born they were presented to each other. Of course the babies knew netti ng about it at the time, as they were both asleep; and even if they had been awake, they would not have understood, as they had had no experience in the ways of the great world into which they had just come. The presentation was a very pretty ceremony, although it was very r slight. It all happened in the old slavery days, on a Louisiana plantation. When the mistress of the place heartl that a little black daughter had come to one of her favorite slaves at the same hour that her own wee babe was laid in her arms, she sent for her hus band and whispered something to him. and he smiled delightedly and called the black fellow Tom from the dining room, and gave an order that sent him grinning out to the quarters. Then, presently old Granny Milly came trudg ing into the great house, with a big gray bundle in her arms. It was Christmas morning, but there were late honeysuckles in bloom and humming-birds at large. Still, it was thought prudent to wrap the new Christmas baby snugly 7in a soft wool shawl for her first little journey in the world. Old Granny Milly was so fat that she could hardly walk, but she bore her self proudly as she carried the little slave baby across the narrow field and through the garden up to the groat house. The "boy" Tom had told every body he had met on the way out, and by the time Granny had started there were many spectators at the cabin doors, and a flock of barefoot black children followed her even to the very limit of their range in the campus of the quarters. It was a fine thing in those days for a slave-born baby to be chosen as a maid to a young white mistress, and the old women who stood with their tur baned heads together watching, all agreed that "Sabina's chile" was "sho' born into luck." When old Milly, short of breath from fat and importance, finally approached the great bed upon which the white mother and pink baby lay, the master of the house bade her place the children side by side, and then he gently opened their tiny right hands, and laying them one within the other, closed them for a moment. Then he lifted the white hand and placed it on the black baby's head. This last was a double signifi cance and meant obedience on one side and protection on the other. The joining hands meant simply that the children were pledged to lifelong friendship, and that they should stand by each other as long as they both should live. The servants who had tiptoed into the room to see the presentation all declared that while they held hands both babes had smiled in their sleep, and it was considered a good omen. The ceremony closed with a short thanksgiving and prayer, and the r ants standing about the bed and out in the hall all bent their heads while the master asked that heaven would bless the children to each other. This was all. And then old Milly proudly took her tiny charge, wrapped again until it looked like a gray co coon, back to its mother fn the cabin. The babies did not meet again until the Sunday, a few weeks later, when they were both baptized in the great square parlor. They were to have six years to sleep and play and grow in before they should assume their rela tions. On every birthday there was a formal visit, when the little Mimi put into the growing Julia's hands a great bundle, so big and heavy that a strong hand had to support it during its pas sage. This contained clothing enough for the coming year—a few new things, and such of milady's dainty cast-offs as the black baby could use. The children often met in the inter vals, naturally, as when Yuyu's mother, s'abina, would come to the house on an errand, bearing Yuyu astride her hip, or sending her toddling on before her, as she grew older; and when Sabina would go in to confer with her mis tress, she would send Yuyu to the nursery, saying, "Run along an' see yo' little mistus." Picked Out the Eggs Herself. The other day a woman went into a grocer's and said: "I want two doze-n hen's eggs. They must all be eggs laid by black hens." The grocer said: "Madame, I am will ing to accommodate you, but you have got the best of me this time. I don't know how to tell the eggs of a black hen from those of a speckled or white one." She said: "I can tell the difference mighty* quick." "If that is so, madame, will you kind ly pick out the eggs for yourself." She did so, and when the two dozen were counted into the basket, the gro cer looked at them and said, sugges tively: "Well, madame, it seems as though the black hens laid all the big eggs." "Yes," she said, "that's the way you tell them."—Hardware. The Cure for Americanitis. Americanitis is on the increase, the wise ones say.
