COTTON CKOWEKV CONVENTION. The American Colton Growers' Protective Association, through Its President, Hector D. Lane, has called a meeting to bo held in Memphis, Tenn., on Mouday, December 30. The Sentinel is requested to urge the attendance ef a delegation from this section, and feels inclined to do so, for the business-like wording of the call leads us to believe that some thing may be done at this meeting to improve the present cotton situation, or at least a foundation laid for future action in the premises. The call for the convention is based on the patent fact thut "cotton is too low; there is a cause for this condition, and it is the purpose of this conven tion to find the cause and adopt the course necessary to better the condi tion." The president of the Association says further: a in is "It is the opinion of the best minds of your country that this consumma tion can only be reached by a resolute, continuous and systematic iule of ac I tion laid down by authorized represen tation, and adhered to by the musses of the cotton growers. "I shall not waste space by in dulging in arguments of the necessity of this action. Five-cent cotton and aturnl effect is its own most poteDt I Je.ider in this cause, and the sounding adjectives of the orator and the well ! rounded sentences of the journalist are j not necessary to awaken the Soutli to | the sad realization of our condition and what is to follow without prompt remedial action on these lines. "The importance of the situation ad dresses itself to our common country. There is no one interested in the ma j teria! prosperity in the South who will not have to bear their pro rata of | this burden. "Upon the* part of the ! Cotton Growers' ? i , i 'American Protective Associa ' tion," I appeal to the peeple to join us in a patriotic, systematic and con j servulive effort to combat these ills 1 that afflict us. All agricultural so i cieties are requested to send represen tations. Wc respectfully invite the presence of hankers , commission men, merchants and all those directly or i indirectly interested in cotton grow J ing.' The President's BI< isage. i We have dutifully and patiently read L. . , ' , ' ' . that drearv message of President Me , \ _ ® Ivinlev to the Congress which assem ,, , \ i bled last Monday, and our humble . . . .. 4 . , 1 judgment is that its most distingulsh : log features are its verbosity and pon j derosity. thousand words were used to express views that eouhl have been voiced in Something like fifteen fifteen hundred, for we find nothing in the message that has not already been discussed by himself and his adminis tration in the public prints. Brielly told, Mr. McKinley expresses satisfaction with the Dingley bill; rec ommends a reform in the currency system, but doesn't suggest anything new: favors the establishment of a national quarantine: upholds the civil : service system: recommends the annex ation of Hawaii, but discountenances j any interference in Cuban affairs, and s i lowj very plainly his toadyism for 1 Spain's good will. The remainder of t) ie message discusses departmental affairs and ison the who lean exceeding ]y i :]tQe document, which is without , weight except in avoirdupois. i Capt. W. S.

Mr. Taylor has been a valued contributor to the Commercial Appeal for some time past, and will no doubt make his new department of that paper a decided feature. Mr. T. M.
