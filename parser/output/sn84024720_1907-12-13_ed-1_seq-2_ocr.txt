They en calling in loans.refusing to t paper, refusing often in some sto pay money on checks on res, when tbe money stood to lositor's credit.

XCLUSION OF JAPANESE. nand for the exclusion of the >se comes from that portion of ntry where the Sand Loiter led tome years ago, that section mayors of cities steal, and other Beers become common felons, c same spirit wbich excluded Inese, again asserting itself, it ghost of Dennis Kearney. If lad been a nation of spirit its would never bave been excluded ie United States unless at the ime all other nations were ex But just anybody could then aina around. Tbe same cannot said of Japan. Japan bas hum lat was considered the greatest oi Europe, certainly the most 1. She did it, and she did it et y. Now Japan has a right to I, aud our treaties accord her c treatment as is accorded "the .vored nation," Her subjects te, have a right to go anywhere sople are allowed to go, and ild be untrue to them if she not demand tucb privlliees. c Sand Loiter has arisen iv iia again, and demanded their id. The reasons for this de re few and far betweeu. We ie press tbat some attorney of ie of Langdon, ot San Erancis hss been one of the pecsecu fcSchinitz and Reuf, says the me must go because tbey Me it." Certainly they are no more so than tbote lv\o icititn feeutle men he has just sent to the penitenti ary.

Sand Lotter, for this Congo will Dever work. But shall a iticians at San Francisco push antry into trouble witb Japan unt of tbeir objections to tbe in of persons of sobriety and y? It seems so. Already our fleet )e moved around to tbe Pacific compelled by the bombastic talk of a few people on the Pacific coast, and the cringing politicians at Washington, coupled with tbe desire of our brave naval officers to have trouble some where. At this iuueture Japan bas s *nt for her Ambassador in this coun. try. What does it mean 7 We bave not heard that a Gaitteai ot Czolgos is among the Japanase Im migrants, bat such and many other equally as bad are among immigrm i from other countries. We bave not .o far met with tbe "Black band" or "Mafia" among Japanese, and there are no Herr Musts or Emma (ioldmans among tbem known to us. Tbe Jap anese seem to lacs such valuable citi zens, such welcome immigrants, aud as compared with our negro citizens,tbey are, as individuals, aud as a nation, as far above tbem in honesty, virtue and patriotism, as the mountain above tbe plain. It bas not been thought neces sary to buru any Japanese for un speakable crimes, as is the case with our colored citizens. They are indus trious, thrifty and sober, and their conduct as a class is irreproachable. But they work. A horrible crime to be sure, and since they do this they must not come iv bere lest tbey spoil a good thing, lest they break up a mo nopoly emigrants from other coun tries hope to establish, or rather bave established. Some day these Sand Lotters of California will force Uncle Sam into trouble witb Japan on ac count of this Dennis Kearney idea,and Uncle Sam will get his whiskers and hair both trimmed, if not his eye teeth ■ So i'.ng as negroes can roll in from Attica, and Dagos from Italy, and Europe's offdcouriugs cm swarm to our shores uuhindered and unlimited, tbere is no principal upon which we can exclude Japanese. But if we undertake it we should bave more reason to do so than the vaporings of Sand Lotters, California politicians and some labor unions on tbe Pacific coast. Certainly it seems ironical wheu we know that Mayor Schmitz and Solicitor Reaf of San Francisco, both foreigners and both now in the penitentiary, were foremost at one time in advocating Japanese exclusion because it is claimed they are "a dis honest people." . CONSERVATIVE STATESMAN. Editor Dispatch: By spontaneous approximation, the two great American leaders of radical ism, Roosevelt and Bryan, seem to have coalesced. At least, their recent apparently prearranged meeting at the White House, in Washington, aud Kthen occurred between them, irs to indicate it. Should these gentlemen happen to be at tbe head of the tickets of the two domi t political parties at tbe next eoiUI election, it would be of concern to the voter wbich he They appear to be in full ac n all live and vital political ques tions. The American people never meant to declare either of them dic tator. They have twice In a most emphatic way notified Mr. Bryan tbat they did not need bim for any purpose. At tbe last November elections, in bis own state, Nebraska, and the state of j Kentucky, where he made himself and nis political views most conspicuous during tbe campaign, the suffragans I made tbeir desire manifest that Mr. tiryan should retire to private life. Nothing, however, seems to daunt bim. In tbe light of all these facts be continues, unsolicited, to decide to, and force bis views upon, the demo cratic, party, a party founded and existing today, upon principles and policies utterly variance with those ad vocated by bim. Not only this but hi X further, and dares to dictate to chief executive of our national rnment, whose power was made ble by tbe political heresies of v, and pledges democratic aid in .. . consummation of tbe radical views of the executive. What democratic congressman does Mr. Bryan own? If there be any such sboddj goods among tbe democratic representatives in congress, the party should now com mence preparation to rid itself of all such at the next election. However much Mr. Bryan's friends may admire bim personally they are doing him and themselves an injustice, and are rendering tbe democratic par ty and the country bad service by con tinuing to urge his nomination. There now exist doubled and quadrupled reasons for declining to support him tbat existed in 1896 and 1900. Demo cratic principles cannot be eliminated except by a destruction of our republi can form of government, bat, another nomination of Bryan would most probably result in the elimination of Bryan from public life, and a total de struction ot tbe democratic party. Nothing, perhaps, more thoroughly disgusts tbe American people, than persistent arrogance, egotism and self importance in a public man, and witb such, patience finally ceases to be a virtue. Hence, if tbe democratic ■' again nominates Bryan, there ict be enough of men remaining b ranks to make it at all form id v a national political contest, c adiiering to the cardinal princi ples of democracy will be compelled to secede from the party calling itself democratic, ally themselves with those adhering to the old creed and thus form a new party under another name, in order tc perpetuate the principles upon which the government was found ed and must exist. The problem is narrowed to this: Will those American citizens who call themselves democrats, permit one political heretio to manufacture a new creed, force it upon their party, and then force his nomination? A West Virginia Democrat. —Staunton Dispatch and News, 5.v inst. By "spontaneous approximation" we have arrived at the conclusion tbat tbe above styled West Virginia Demo crat "coalesced" with Mark Hanna in 1896 and 1900 and voted straight for McKinley, or worse yet for Palmer and Buckner. The same "spontaneous approximation*' brings as to tbe con clusion that he is sick of bis job, for judging from the grimmaces he makes he would not be in more torment had he "coalesced" with some rat poison. The same "spontaneous approxima tion" to bis Democratic tendencies leads as further to believe that in 1904 be beheld the "consummation" of his political desires in tbe "elimination" of Mr. Bryan and tbe elevation of Mr. Parker, on wbicb occasion he came back as a lost speep, and allied himself with other "suffragans'' under the the barner made of that ''shoddy goods," with a "formidable determi nation to perpetuate the persistent ar rogance, egotism and self importance" of tbe fence jumpers, malcontents, renegades, campaign fund grabbers, and corruptiocists, who had along witb Mark Hanna and other election bribers in previous elections, made politics in American a stench in the nostrels of civilization, the fruits of which we are now enjoying, for we know positively now tbat this putridi ty and rottenness surrounding us was given its caste and impetus in the cor rupt politics of 1896, when voters were bought as sheep and the presidency ! was stolen. Even then the hated Bryan got one million more votes than B beloved McKinley, and as between bated Bryan and tbe beloved Par-! ker as a vote gatherer we feel ashamed tospeak,it Is sosaddeuiug if not humil iating a subject. Inasmuch,howevre, as West Virginia Democrats of like ten dencies as the above writer, have so effectually handed their State over to the Republicans, these "spontaneous approximations" of opi ion as to what real Democrats should do,or witb whom Mr. Biyan aud his suffragans should coalesr, aie of too little importance to be seriously considered. Tbey will no doubt, therefore, leave this West Vir ginia adviser and those wbo think as he does to tbeir own meditation.*. Since no matter bow clean tbey may be washed, at tbe first opportunity they will return again to their wal lowing iv the mire. • —.> s 

PREACHES ONE THING, PR AC HUES ANOTHER Tbe government, at least tbe bead of it, is counseling tje people to have confidence in the banks and put tbeir money in tbem. Tbe government, however, does not let any of its money go into banks in tbis country. It sup plies tbe New York banks abundantly —bat here even a bank of National deposit is not allowed to bave money collected by the Poßtofnse or tbe In ternal Revenue department. All such money must go to Washington. Thus our country is drained in that way witb no returning relief. It is a poor rule tbat does not work: both ways. Tbe government preaches to the peo ple a doctrine it will not practice causing tbem to lose confidence even AND THEY DID CAST LOTS. Two Senators from North Dakota recently drew straws for wbich should name certain appointees. Tue Presi dent of tbe United States held the straws. So it only made a straws difference whether Dick or Tom got the place—both, we suppose, were po litical heelers, and t bere was only tbe slightest shade of difference between tbem, both likely were unfit. But Ibis is tbe first time we have heard that for the vestments of Government offi cials did they cast lots. The recall of Ambassador Aoki by the Japanese government from Wash ington, just as our fliet is sailing for tbe Pacific ocean, caused a fall in stocks in New York, though very few of them bad far to fall Long Dale furnace has shut down, the first time in its existence. It withstood all provious panics—but a Roosevelt panic it couid uot withstand, it was too strenuous. There is little in the President's message wbicb resembles him except 'its verbosity. It consists <.f over '30 000 words. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. (from our Hezuiar uorre.pondeni ) Washington, D. C., December 7. — Quite a sensation was created in tbe political world on Friday wbeu the President stated to a pro nirient bank er of Pennsylvania, who told bim that the people of that State wanted bim for another term. "That cannot be. I cannot serve beyoDd my present term. lam grateful to the American people for tbeir kindly feeling toward me, but somebody else must carry on tbe work." Tbe conviction is grow ing among the national committeemen of tbe Republican party, iv session in Washington this week, tbat this state ment is final and the belief is current tbat an official statement will be made, to tbisrffecr, before many more weeks. This conviction as it spreads leaves some of the eommitteemen without anchorage. Few aie willing to risk the chance of falling out witb tbe ad. ministration, and some have recourse to tbe entirely safe coarse of declaring for Mr. Roosevelt despite his personal j attitude. But this conviotion is causa for infinite relief among those politic ians who at heart wish some other candidate, but who fear the conse quences of aligning themselves with the faction which opposes Mr. Roose velt. Thus it will be seen clearly that the Republican brethren do not dwell together in peace aod harmony. Evidence has already been given tbat tbe army nominations snot to tie Senate by the President are not to be permitted to go through without question by that body. Protests have been filed against confirmation of Brig. Gen. J. B. Aleshire, to be quar termaster general, and against Brig. Gen. William W. Witherspoon, of the War College, on the ground that they have been advanced over the heads of officers ahead of tbem in rank. The real facts in tbe case are that Senator Hopkins, of Illinois, has a constituent in Chisago who is endeavoring to palm off on the government a batch of horses pronounced unfit by Gen. Ale shire wbo is an expert in these matters. Hence the bold up of his promotion by the Illinois Senator. The recall of Viscount Aoki and the' information received at the State De partment from our. Ambassador at Tokyo that Baron Kogoro Tskahira will in all probability succeed Viscoant Aoki as Japanese Ambassador at Washington, have created no little sensation in diplomatic and adminis tration circles. Baron Takahiras appointment would undoubtedly be acceptable to this government, and he is on very good terms with President j Roosevelt. Some effort has been made to make it appear that Ambassa dor Aoki's return to Japan is a symp tom of friction in the relations between the United States and Japan but this is treated as absurd by tbe adminis tration. While tbe real reasons for tbe recall are not as yet perfectly un derstood, it ie quite certain this coun ty has bad no hand in the matter. Tne recall is an affair of tbe Japanese [ diplomatic service, and its motlt c mast !be sought for in tbe purposes and 1 methods of Japanese diplomacy. ! The President's message to Congress excited little interest or comment, but ; one opinion seems to be universal and .' that is that it was entirely too long and it is considered somewhat signifi cant that but one newspaper in the city of New York carried the message in fall. Announcement was made in Wash-! ington on Thursday nigbt k that the citizens of Cleveland, Ohio, are more than anxious to have tbe Democrat.c convention meet there, and when the Democratic National Committee meets in Washington on Thursday next, it is whispered that Mayor Tom Johnson of that city will be on hand witb tbe promise of a fund of $100,000, all of which bas been raised, and much by popular subscription, to bave tbe next convention beld in tbe Forett City. So far as is known, no other city will submit a proposition promis ing as much money as Cleveland < ffere, and it is understood tbat its citizei s are inspired not alone by tbe desire to eet big conventions in the babit of meeting there, but that the condition of Republican affairs in tbe State aug ments tbeir desire. The advance guard of t c committeemen, Tom Tag gart of Indiana, tbe National Chair man, is expected to arrive in Wash ington either Saturday of this, or San day of next week. The three sessions held by tbe Na tional Rivers and Harbors Congress convention in this city, were marked by addresses by men of prominence who represented every section of the Uuited (States. The speakers included governors of States, presidents of large railroad companies, and others wbo bave the cause at heart. Local Option for Washlng'ai. Although tbe temperance fight in the District of Columbia bas not act ually opened, it is promised tbat it shall be inaugurated the first week in January, at the latest. Several organizations will have charge of the fight before Congress. It is claimed that if the Committee on the District of Columbia, of the House of Representatives, is constituted as expected, a majority of its members will vote to prohibit the sale of liquor in the capital, or to allow the citizens of tbe District to vote upon tbe ques tion, in accordance with tbe provisions of a bill introduced by Representative John Lamb, of the Third Virginia District. Tbe spectacle of residents of tbe national capital casting ballots on election day would be novel in tbe ex treme, since few of tbem, comparative" ly, have ever witnessed such a thing. It bas been nearly forty years since the right of suffrage was taken from tbe District of Columbia, the national government disfranchising many thousands of white citizens in order to prevent practical domination of the negro in the government of the capital of the nation. Tbe local option idea is thought to be popular in the District of Columbia. Ople Read Says Nobody but Bryan. Opie Read who lectured here last week was seen in Richmond on Mon day by a Leader reporter and from that paper we get tbe following: Opie Read, conjurer of smiles and tears, founder of the Arkansas Travel er, author and lecturer, with touseled hair and black necktie awry, sat in tbe office of the Radcliffe Lyceum Bureau, American National Bank building, today and talked- interestingly of the prospect for the nomination of Bryan, the advantages of Chicago as a place of residence, Bill Nye, James Whit comb Riley, English humorists on tbe American lecture rostrum, his own affection for his native Tennessee and a variety of other subjects, say the Richmond News Leader. "Tell as something about yourself the reporter suggested. ''Tut, tut," remonstrated the humor ist, "I ye been touring the Southern country, down to the borders of Mexico; I've been into the Black Hills. everywhere, and have heard nothing but Bryan. The name seems to pre vade the atmosphere. lam convinced tbat the people will have no other nominee in the coming presidential election." ■ a, , If you should buy 95c worth of goods of us and tender $1.00 to pay for the same, you would wait for your change, would you not ?
