The President’s annual message to Congress was read before that body on Tuesday. The message fills twenty col umns of the average newspaper and uses the new form of spelling recommended by the Simplified Spelling Board. It covers a wide range of public questions, some much discussed, others not so much considered by ,tbe public, and while it will meet with hearty approval by most of the President’s supporters it will no doubt be just as severely criticized by others not in accord with his views. Opening with an allusion to our nation al prosperity, a characteristic of the Chief Executive is reflected in the closing des ertatiou on the importance of the prepara tion for war, a reflection of the big sties policy also being seen in the recommen-1 dation for an increase in the fighting I strength of our uavy. The enactment of law prohibiting cam paign contributions by the great corpora tions of the country is a recommendation which will find universal favor. Consid erable discussion is also devoted to the control of the great corporations, which have become a public menace. Federal supervision is urged, the bills passed at the last session being highly commended but further legislation insisted upon. Government ownership does not find favor with the President, as he says con trol and regulation by the Government is the best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railroads. The limiting of working hours of rail road employes to eight hours is favored, and the employment of children in fac tories denounced as a crime. Lower tariff or else absolute free trade with the Philippines is desired, and the admittance of Porto Ricans to citizenship favored. The Japanese question, which has been much before the people of late, with war and other talk, is given a great deal of space in the message, and the Japs come in for unstinted praise, the demand being made that these people be pnt on the same footing with other for eigners and given the right of naturaliza tion as American citizens. In order to reduce ‘'swollen fortunes” a graduated tax on inheritances is recom mended, and a graduated income tax. While the President praises the present Congress as having done more good work than that of any other in our time he re minds them more is needed and crowds enough recommendations in bis message to keep them busy for months to come. Many other of the salient points might be mentioned but elsewhere in this issue the message will be found in condensed form and the substance of it gleaned by our readers without the reading of it in its entirety, requiring possibly more time than the majority of people would devote to it. Four bids were received and opened at Washington for the supply of Chinese labor for the Panama canal, the wage figures ranging from nine to thirteen cents (gold) per hour. For a ten-hour day this would mean from 90 cents to $1.30 per day. It is understood that this is the rate at which the labor will be sup plied by the contractors, and not the amount which will be paid to the laborers The United States will pay from nine to thirteen cents an hour to the labor agent for each of the coolies which he furnishes. Tue laborer will receive what is left after the labor agent deducts his commission, which will probably be 25 per cent. The laborers will receive from six to nine cents an hour. The President is back from the Panama Canal and is literally iu the saddle, just as much so when he sits at the Council table surrounded by his Cabinet as when he rides in the Park. As I have said political wise acres predict a dull and for mal session with no legislation to speak of outside the appropriation bills. Con gress doubtless expects to do nothing much beyond this indispensable legisla tion but there is a personage in the White House, when he is not everywhere else, who has little reverence for precedent and not the slightesi fear of innovation. It would be just like biui to ask Congress to do several other things and recently Con gress has gotten in the way of doing what he asks, not altogether because be asks it but because it is known that an unpre cedented tnajorita of the people are at his virile back and elbow. Therefore it is | possible that since be has recently again i and again reasserted that be will not have third term he may try to make Con- j gress work eight hours a day or over time during his present term and enact that legislation with regard to Santo Do mingo. the Philippines, the inheritance tax, the Panama Canal, and an elastic currency, for which he has stood. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. The last session of the Fifty Ninth Con gress will have convened by the time this letter is in print and in spite of the pre dictions that it will do nothing but pass the appropriation bills there is a strong probability that the session will be oue of interest and will perhaps be a continua tion of the strenuons legislation of the first session. The Ship Subsidy bill which has been up in several recent Congresses only to be consigned to the grave of a Committee, has a fair chance of being passed. There is a strong public senti ment even in the interior states and far removed from either the Pacific, Atlan tic or Gulf littorals in favor uf restoring sea supremacy to the United States. The | reason behind this sentiment is not merely the promotion of American trade I but a desire to enure American seamen in order that we may have in time of war that indispensable source for recruits to our war vessels which has always given England her supremacy on water aud has recently enabled Japan to win the most brilliant naval victories since the days of Nelson. Secretaries Root and Shaw did not give prominence to this phase of the question iu their recent speeches. Their plea was for a wider commerce on Amer ican bottoms, but the menace of war cloud already bigger than a man’s hand in the East is sufficient to make it prudent to mau our ships-and to have a reserve such as can only be maintained in modern times through an extensive subsidized merchant marine. *** The Post Office Department of the United States under the management of the present Postmaster General Cortelyou is probably better conducted than it has ever been in recent times. More irregu larities within the Department have been exposed and more frauds using the mails as an auxiliary have been exposed than in any recent or perhaps than in any pre vious administration. Nevertheless the Post Office Department of the United States, like every other Department of the Government, is loaded down with useless live as well as useless dead material, the establishment costs much more than is necessary and people of the United States who use the Post Office to a greater ex tent per capita than any other people in the world have to pay twice as much for the service as they ought to be required to pay. Mr. Boyce, the great publisher of Chicago, has emphasized these undis puted facts by proposing to take over the entire postal service of the United States and conduct it for one-balf the amount that it is now costing the people, thus saving the country probably from fifty to seventy millions a year. But this is not the only advantage that he and the pow erful syndicate back of him hold out. He proposes to reduce postage for letters to one cent and to reduce the other three classes of postage for mail matter in an equal ratio. There is not the least doubt that it can be done and with profit to the contractors, and there is just as little doubt that every other department of the Government except perhaps the military and naval departments could under priv ate management be made more efficient and much less expensive. * * # The Government Printing Office, that mammoth asylum for pampered political printers, has been in a state of turmoil all summer. Few people in the United States know how huge and corrupt this excresence bad grown to be. IfTts nearly three thousand employes were polled and required to say what they thonght the object of the Government Printing Office was an overwhelming majority of them would answer “to furnish salaries aud places to the favored and elect of the printing profession,” namely themselves. It has been so long run as a kind of eelymosynary institution that when Pres ident Roosevelt appointed a real business like, practical printer as its manager the effect was like an explosive or a ferment and the office has been iu a seething con- i dition ever since. Printers from the j outside and from the inside have used every variety of persuasion and threat! with the new Public Printer. The papers i of Washington have taken the part of the ' great mass of spoiled and unruly employes \ because it is the popolar side and because ! the papers depend in great part upon ; these people, their cousins, sisters aud aunts for patronage, but, although the' new man, Public Printer Stillings, has' j been iu charge only ten months and working under great disadvantage it is known that he has saved hundreds of thousands of dollars, and how he has done it will soon appear iu a report now ready for Congress. Yearly Picture Talcing. Some families make it a custom to visit the photographer’s yearly, all go ing together to sit for portraits singly ;>r in groups. It is a good custom, but lias to be strictly observed or it may begin to be honored in the breach. One family permits no postponement of the yearly trip to the photo gallery. A day Is set, and every one must go. There fire no penalties for nonattendance at Hiis family reunion before the camera, because there are no infringements of the rule. The custom began, with this family many years ago, when the first baby came to It. Today It has a com plete photographic record of family life for almost a generation. Some of the children are married and are now photographed with their own children, while death has made vacancies 1b the later groups.—New York Press. Another Story. An aged Scotch minister, about to marry for the fourth time, was ex plaining his reason to an elder. "You see, I am an old man now, and I canna expect to be here verra lang. When the end comes I wad like to have some one to close my eyes.” The elder nod ded and said, “Awell, meenister, I have had twa wives, and baith of them opened mine.”—London News. One Valuable Asset. “What’s the matter with the man in the second story of this house? The ioctor’s been coming here regularly for '.'he past three months!” "Oh, he’s the doctor’s best patient. He doesn’t get well and he doesn’t die!”—Philadelphia Inquirer. A Texas Wonder. There’s a Hill at Bowie, Tex., that’s twice as big as last year. This wonder is W. L. Hill, who from a weight of 90 pounds has grown to over 180. He says “I suffered with a terrible cough, and doctors gave me up to die of Con sumption. I was reduced to 00 pounds, when I began taking Dr. King’s New Discovery lor Con- ‘ sumption, Coughs and Colds. Now after taking 12 bottles, I have more than doubled iu weight and am completely cured.” Only sure! Cough and Cold cure. Guaran teed by Eli T. Reynolds, Druggist. 50c and
