The mfcaion of these gentlemen is well known to Gen.

It is the habit of Senator SrxxiR to come to each session of Congress with his satchel fall of new bills. It teems, from a notice whiih he gave in the Senate onTuesday, that during the last recess he has concocted a new plan to shut out ten States, by an act of Congress, bom representation in Ooneress or voting upon the Constitutional Amend ments on the alleged ground that the gov- crnments of those States are illegal and void. That it was predetermined in joint caucus during the last session tokecp them out from any participation in tho next Presidential election we knew, and so stated at the time; and that the Hon. Tbaddics Stevix de clared in his place in the House that he ut terly repudiated the idea that they were to be taken into account in ascertaining whether three fourths of the States shall hare ratified the pending amendments to the Constitu tion, vre also knew; but by what process and under what excuses or disguises we could neither conjecture or divine. Here the " Great Giastlcus " comes. It is to go back ward over all the legislation had sinco the war, inclusive of all the laws referred to in Tnr. PaxsiMNT'a , ,t t ,i.,i. a law tu be uotsed ir.tr an Hntotea v.iA v.. I two thirds of both Houses, that (hose States are illegally organized and ought not to be repraented in Congrett or allowed to vote upon the Conttitutional Amendment!. This is, of course, only tho prelude to the contem plated movement to exclude the electoral xotetof thote Statetrom the count at the next Presidential election. We denominated this plot to muzzle the voice of those States in the political affairs of tho country last spris; a conspiracy against the Constitution; and we have since seen no reason for changing our opinion. We have been silent upon the subject re cently only because the conspirators hare themselves been silent Mr. Scxuxa having taken the guardianship of the monster, and having given notice of his intention to intro duce it into the Senate as a Radical prede termined measure, the duty Is again imposed npon us of exposing its fearful enormity. The original caucus plan was to endeavor to get some Senator into the Vice President's chair at the time appointed for counting the next electoral votes who will be willing to ignore the packages containing the certifi cates of the several electoral colleges of the unrepresented States, and who will refuse to break their seals, thereby rejecting those votes altogether. As soon as the project came to our knowledge wc took occasion to remind those gentlemen that they had bor rowed the idea from the followers oi Jonx C. Brecxmxidoe, who talked of serving the Lixcolb votes, In the winter of 1881, in the samo way; but they had not the courage to attempt to carry it out. We took occasion to soy farther, that in tho event that tho electoral votes of thoso States would, with others, elect a President if counted, that can didate, whoever he might be, would bo Pres ident, or we would have another revolution, more bloody perhaps than the one we have passed through, because there would be a loyal sentiment In tho North to support the South in her electoral rights. Although we do not suppose that anything wo may say will deter the majority In either Jiranchfrom prosecuting this measure through tonlaw,yotwemust utter our protest against It as a very dangerous as well as revolution ary measuro, and one which will one day or another return to plague its inventors. With what sort or metaphysics can Mr. Scxxer pretend that the States in rebellion did not reorganize, themselves legally since the war t Is it because Tax Paxsuizxr, following Mr. LncoLx's precedent, had initiated tho move ment by and through provisional Governors t This is Gen. Butler's point ; and we suppose it to no his. Has It not been shown over and .again that The Preside! possessed tho power to appoint provisional Governors by tue laws or nations ? Then, how Is It to be made out by any argument having the faint est semblance or reason that those State governments are illegal t We shall see as the measure proceeds.

There is no doubt that "those who heard him read Itpmafafy, at' different timet," will "scarcely recognise it," as we are assured that no tuch persons exi'sf. The writer or the paragraph quoted above goes so far as to say " "The proposed three constitutional amend. ments, which I know tceie 'n, have been left out" At the time the bogus message appeared. attempting to foreshadow the real document, knowing there was no basis for the statement, we printed in our issue of November 29 the following paragraph: "Somebodvhas telerrashed to tho country that President Johnson will propose several amendments to the Constitution in his forth coming message." Mr. John son's pretent opinion it that (Ae Constitution hat teen 'amended' enough, and that it ought not to bt tinkered any more" The message itself is not only a direct con tradiction to tho b'ogus production and veri fication of our statement, but it is consistent with Mr. Jbmcsoit's record, since he has been President, relative to amending the Consti tution.' This correspondent must be one of " those who heard Tm PaxaiDEKT read it privately, at different timet I" He has made a mistake.

RADICAL DIFFICULTY IT MUST BE SURMOUNTED. The proposition to make Congress per petual instead of perennial met with unex pected difficulties when it was broached in the House yesterday. The Connecticut mem bers are not elected until tho first Monday inApriffand some obstacles in the way of fixing an earlier election exist In the shape of organic laws. In California an election cannot be held so say the Representatives of that State at the time it would be neces sary to hold it in order to get the new mem bers here on tho 4th of March, because of the rainy season, which prevents the inhabitants in some parts of the State from assembling at the polls. Now ii is a little strange that some progressive radical did not Only pro pose to override the fundamental law's of Connecticut but to abolish the rainy season in California. Surely, in view of the great necessity that Congress should sit hero suck ing their claws and watching Tni Pusionrr, they would be justified in revolutionizing the meteorology of the Pacific slope. If the clerk of the weather should prove refractory, knI"!,lca biml Let ths Progressives press this point. Let their motto be, "A perpetual Congress and no rest for the Washington bed-bugs 1" RADICAL MISREPRESENTATIONS The radical correspondent of the New York Timet makes another statement about Tui Pkesidkxt's message which is about as true as that correspondent's prediction that Mr. Jonxsoit would recommend to Congress the adoption of three amendments to the Constitution. The radical sensational item izer says : "Following the advice of leading Demo cratic friends, he saw fit to reiterate his old doctrine of restoration," Ac. We pronounce this statement as without the slighest foundation in truth. Mr. Jobh so.v; unlike Mr. Ratxoko, adheres to his original line of policy on restoration because he believed it was right when he first an nounced it, and believes so now, regardless of the "advice of leading Democrats;" and Congress acknowledged the principle when it admitted Tennessee and allowod ex-rebel Btoxk to take a seat in the midst of the rad ical members of the House.

Last evening the National was crowded in every part, all the seats, the extra seats and the standing room being appropriated and tenaciously held to the end of the play of "Elizabeth," In which Madame Ilirroat and her troupe illustrate some of the most in tensely interesting pages of English history. The critics of other cities having awarded, by universal acclaim, the first place in Ristoxi's repertoire to Queen Euxabxtu, a great num ber of our best people deferred all other en gagements to attend her representation of this remarkable character. Tbey found out when the performance was ended that the praises by the critics had been justly bestowed, and the house warmed up to a much higher pitch of enthusiasm than at any time previously daring the Ristoei engagement.

THE NATIONAL gEPPBLIOAN, FRIDAY MORlTCNGr, DECEMBER 7. 1866 THE 1ADI0AL CAUCUS. THTr i? r jT '. v i Hoa Henry J, Raymond In the Valley of Humiliation; ' The following report of tho doings of the caucus held by the radical members of Con gress, Wednesday evening, appears in the Northern papers : The caucus of the Republican members of the House, held at the Capitol this evening, was unusually large, nearly a hundred mem bers being present. The following measures, reputed from the select committee, were agreed upon: First. To pass a bill regulating the organi sation of the House, directing the Clerk to place no names on the roll from States not represented in the preceding Congress or de clared entitled to representation, and pro viding that no electoral votes shall be counted from any State not represented at the time in Congress. Second. To pass a bill remedying the de feet in the law which may prevent any State from canvassing the votes for President and Ylce President Third. To pass a law changing the time of the meeting of every Congress, with a view to assembling on the 4th of March. Fourth. To raise a special committee for the rigid investigation of the New Orleans riot, the' number of lives destroyed, the pro perty burned, and to what .extent Govern ment officers were involved' therein. The committee to have power to aend for persons and papers, to be accompanied by the Ber- eantalarms, and to report appropriate egtslation. Fifth. To order a select committee to' In vestigate the proceedings under the laws for the collection of direct taxes in the rebel States, and the seizure and sale of abandoned and confiscated lands and other property. Sixth. The Committee on Pensions to in- Sulre whether any pensioners In the disloyal tates, struck from the, pension rolls, have been restored in violation of law. Seventh. A special. committee to investi gate the facta connected with the release of the murderers or the Union soldiers in South Carolina, recently set at large. Mr. Ashley, of Ohio, said he noticed as present the Kentieman who had drawn no the address of the Philadelphia Convention, and asked If he was a member of the Union party and had any right there. The chairman, Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, rcpuea, amia mucn laugnter : " Whllt tkt limp holla oat to lura, la viitn iiBDtr nay warn." Mr. Raymond, on being asked whether he did not participate in the Philadelphia Con vention, replied that he had. but not in anv spirit of hostility to the Union party ; that he entered the Convention to strengthen that party, uunxing it snouta oe mete conserva tive man was. nut wnen Me round the Con vention likely to lead to the defeat of the Union party he abandoned it, and had ever since done his utmost to maintain and sup port we vniou pony, lie aiso saia uat ne approved of the measures reported here this eveninsr. Mr. Schofield moved that the gentleman be allowed to remain in the caucus or not, at us option, ana to judge lor Himself whether he was a member of the Union party or not Mr. Lawrence, or unto, asked Mr. Rav. mond whether he adhered to the doctrine of the Philadelphia address, and particularly to the clause that tho rebel States could not ratify the constitutional amendment without dishonor? Mr. Raymond was understood to deny that there was such a clause in It. Ho adhered to tbat address according to hla own con- sirucuon oi u, out not- according to Ine con struction sometimes put upon it by others. Mr. Stevens could not see how Mr. Ray mond could pretend to any connection with the Union party alter his membership in the Philadelphia Convention, and his authorship of the address put forth by that body. Messrs. Darling and Hale, of New York, and Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, spoke in favor of Mr. Raymond remaining in the caucus, and Mr. Morris, of the same State, and Mr. Cook, of Illinois, against his doing so. Mr. Raymond made some further explana tions with regard to the Philadelphia address, when the caucus adopted Mr. Scofield's reso lution by a vote of 66 against 25. Mr. Schenck, of Ohio, offered a resolution that no gentleman can honorably and con sistently be a member of the Union party, and act with Union members of Congress, m caucus, who adheres to the address of the Philadelphia Convention, held in August last After considerable debate on the resolu tion between Gen. Schenck and Gen. Banks, Mr. Bingham and others, it was laid on the tabic, on motion of Mr. Bingham, on the ground that it was entirely out of order, as Ft referred to the case of Mr. Raymond, which had been previously settled by the resolution of Mr. Scofield. The vote was close on laying on tho table, being 38 to 36. It Is proper to say that no press reporters were present and that the whole was ob tained from the recollection of members. The caucus passed a resolution, unani mously, that the members of It were bound to sustain the propositions reported as party measures. Mr. Stevens moved that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the proceedings of ine caucus, nut it adjourned berore a vote was taken on this motion. Tho Baltimore Council and Got. Hwann. In the Baltimore City Council tho follow ing resolution was presented on Wednesday anernoon: Retolved by the Mayor and City Council o Baltimore, That a committee bo appointed with a view of preparing an address to the National Congress now assembled, settina- forth our grievances received at the hands of a recreant mate uovernor by His very liberal construction and Interpretation of our State laws: to make a formal demand upon that body for the protection of the loyal people of maryianu oy a rigid eniorcemem oi me laws oi ine mate as tney now exist Afrer considerable discussion, the resolu tion was laid on the table for the present Cenaare of Gen.

Deri's message, makes the following pertinen t remarks) "With regard to the const! tutional amend ments he Is, very properly, s) lent He could not have aliudea to them in terms of recom mendation one way or the c ither, with pro priety, ior two very sumue m reasons t in tho first place the matter has passed from Congress and gone to the States. He could not nave recommended Congress to take any new action without i mpertinence: neither could he in tho second place proxrly make anv recommendation to the Stat !a a com munication made to Co ngress under tie Con stitution. The Impropriety will reaiUy sug gest itself to any into fllgent reader, of the President's seeking officially to influence the action of States with regard: to changes in the organic law, of which he is the recot, vised and sworn executive and defender. 'With regard to. the question of suflV-age, which is now so deenlv arltatlno thu . lun. try, the absolute reticence of the Presld ent may be similarly explained. The question ' is concededly one wh'.ch belongs solely to U e States. Congress has nothing whatever t o do with it other than by proposing amend ' ments to tho Federal Constitution to chango me provisions by which It was originally placed in their keeping. It would, therefore, navo been absurd in the President to recom mend that subject to the further considera tion of Congress. So far, therefore, from con cciving tbat the President has been guilty of an act of omission with regard to the amend ments and the suffrage question, we are of the opinion that he acted wisely and well Id resisting the temptation which existed tu allude in direct terms ta two such politic si firebrands. It was far wiser and better, and we trust It will prove far more effective, for the President t impress upon Congress the vital truths, the warnings and admonitions of the Pater Patrice, of Jefferson, and of Jack son contained in their' utterances quoted by him; and thus, by indirection, to bring Con gress up to the apprehension of the dangers against which those elder statesmen, have left their solemn warnings." - K.
