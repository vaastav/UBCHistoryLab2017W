Chicago ©tifcune. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5,1800 MONETARY. Tuesdat:Ev*kiito, Dec. 4, 1860- There has been no unusual pressure to-day qv cr the pajjnents of the lit and 4th, being the lari day, and obligations so far as wo know baling been p’fpmpUy met. In every line except exdxange the money market here was never better supplied. Currency slnci- the panic commenced luts been dally accumulating, and the hanks generally are burthen «d with dejmslts, whlcli neither they nor their cus tomers know bow to use. With exchange at any decent' price, large amounts would bo remitted East, But, as it la, payments are delayed as long as ]K>s>lhl«, and In many cases extensions arc mutual ly nrrahgcd, hoping that rates mast come down. As yet there seems little prospect of a change for the JH-ttcr, for to-day selling rates arc firm at 8 rent, premium. Soles are made only sparingly to customers. Some houses arc charging 10 9 cent. Buying 6Jtf©7X. Gold4e firmer. Buying price 7 $ ccqt. pr**™, selling 8, and firm. The following arc the dobing rates of F.

A disposition thus Car seems to prevail to 'ask the Legislature for each amendments as will effectually prevent the iseoc of unredeemable cur rency. That displace to the character of Illinois nil are determined shall be effectually wiped out. Those who are obliged tobuy exchange at the pres out exorbitant ; rates feel considerable bitterness towards the banks; but we hare Utuo doubt that u conservative spirit will in the end prevail, one that will be willing that men with real capital shall es tablish banks, and that men who have been amass iug fortune* on what they owe the people, shall tie ruled out. That smart game has been played about long enough. ' / Milwaukee.—The SentineJ of this morning *-ays: / •' Money matters remain in etatu quo. Exchange I- scarce and firm a* ever - at G $ cent, premium, mnuinally. The requirement* of produce nj>cnit t<trs being light, there Is no scarcity of currency ti med the demand for business purposes, but during tiii* unsettled state of Lnaticlal affairs at the East the bank* arc not djspos’ d to make ad vances on doubtful paper, and that includes a great tl-.’al which, under orcliauy circumstances, would nut be questioned. Eschange yesterday wa»T sccnt., so that It was really 2 ?? cent cheaper In Milwaukee than in this city. The difference le due to Wisconsin currency being more easily convertible. In Mil* waukee quotations for exchange arc made for their own currency, while here Illinois and Wisconsin arc taken without discrimination. At times dur ing the past two or three weeks Wisconsin hat Been purchased at 102 $ cent premium, and lii tome eases even 8 $9 cent was paid. Pirrsncsau.—The GozeUt of yesterday has the following: There is a hopcfalfecUng among bankers,wltha rlow but steady growth of confidence. Tito movements in the Exchange market was tiuite favorable, end this is perhaps the most reli able indication presented of the strength and char :w>rof the undercurrent in financial affairs.

(Jwin, Harlan, Johnson of Tenn., Thomson and Wilkinson, appeared in their seats. Prayer was offered by the Chaplain. Mr. Bigler, iu behalf of the Committee to wait on the President, reported that they had performed their dnty. The President’s Message was delivered by A. J. Glossbrenner, his Private Secretary. The Message was then read. President** message* After alluding to the great commercial, ag ricultural and other material prosperities t>f the country, the President asks, Why is it, then, that discontent now so extensively pre vails, and the union of the States, which is the source of all these blessings, Is threatened with destruction? The long-continued and intemperate Interference of the Northern peo ple with the question of slavery iu the South ean States has at length produced its natural effect. The different sections of the Union are now arrayed against each other, and the time ha* arrived, so much dreaded by the Father of his Country, when hostile geographical parties have been "formed. This docs not proceed solely from the claim on the part of Congress or the Territorial Legislature to exclude slave iy from the territories, nor trom the efforts of the different States to de feat the execution of the Fugitive Slave law; but the immediate peril arises from inces sant and violent agitation of the slavery ques tion hi the North for the last quarter of a cen tury which has produced its malign influence on the slaves, and inspires them with -notions of freedom. Hence a sense of security no longer exists around the family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to ap prehension of sen ile Insurrection. Many a matron throughout the South retires at night iu-ilread ofwbat may befall herself and child- Ten before the morning. Should this appre ’ hensiou of domestic danger extend and inten sify itself until it shall pervade the masses of the Southern people, then disunion will be come inevitable. Self-preservation is the first law of nature, and no political union, however fraught with blessings andbenefitsin all other respects, can long continue, if the necessary consequence be to render the homes and fire sides of nearly half the parties to it habitu ally and hopelessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds of suck a union must be severed. It is my conviction that this fatal period has not yet arrived. . t After referring to the incessant agitation against slavery at the North for the last twen ty-five years, both by the press and the people, and asserting that the time of Congress is oc cupied with violent speeches on this never ending subject, he remarks: How easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery question forever, sind restore peace and harmony to t his distracted country. 11 can be done by let ting the slave States alone, stud permitting them to manage their own State affaire, as they only are responsible before God for slavery ex isting among them, and with which the North lias wo more right to interfere than with the similar Institutions in Russia or Brazil; and Hie I'rcMdcnt still relics on the good sense and forbearance of the people. He alleges that it is out of the power of any President to accom plish but little; which leads him to observe tUaithcdection of any one of ourtcllow-cltizens to the office of President docs not in itself af ford just cause for dissolving the Union. The late election having been held In strict con formity with the provisions of the Constitu tion, docs not justify a revolution to destroy tins very’ Constitution. Reason, justice and regard for the Constitution, all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the President elect before re sorting to sneh a remedy. Mr. Buchanan refers to the fact that the President’s province*is not to make but to execute the laws. It is alleged as one cause ■ for immediate secession, tliat the Southern I Slates arc denied equal rights with the other State* iu the common territory. But by what authority arc these denied? Not by Congress, which has never passed, and I believe never will pass any act to exclude slavery from these Territories; and certainly not by the Supreme Court, which lias solemnly decided that slaves arc property, and, like all other property, their owners have a right to take them into the common Territories, and hold them there under the protection of the Constitution. The anticipation that Congress may pass some law obnoxious is no good reason for dissolution. The President reasserts the power of Con gress over property in the Territories, and the sacred rights of property arc recognized by the Constitution. '• The most palpablf/vlolallon of constitu tional duty which has yet been committed, consists iti the acts of different State Legisla tures to defeat the execution of the fugitive' „lavc law. It ought to be remembered how ever, that, for these acts, neither Congress or any President can justly be held responsible. Having been passed in violation of the Federal Constitution, they are, therefore, null ami void. It will be the duty of the next Presi dent, as It has been my own, to act with vigor in executing the Fugitive Slave law against confirmed enactments of State Legislatures. We are not to presume in advance that he will violate his duty, which would be at war with every principle of justice. Let us wait for the overtact. , . . iue *’ ugitivc Slave law has been carried into execution in every contested case since, the commencement of the present Administration. Let us trust that the State Legislatures will repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments. Unless this shall be done with out any unnecessary delay, it is impossible for any human power to save the Union; and the Southern States have a right to de mand this act of justice from the Northern States. Should this be refused, the injured Stales, alter having first used all peaceful I means to obtain redress, would be justified In 1 revolutionary resistance tpJUe Government of I the Union. .

Jack- Message pi 1833, relative™ the Nttliliea jtfon Ordinance of South Carolina, and says this government was intended by its founders to be perpetWSgpd not to be annulled at the pleasure of anv one of the contracting parties. The President then enumerates the powers conferred on Congress by the Federal govern ment, and that these powers may be effectual, it also possesses the right to layondcollcctall import duties and other taxes, ami has adopted effectual means to restrain the States from in- . terfering. In order still further to secure uninterrupted exercise of those high pow ers against State Interposition, it is provi ded that this Constitution and the laws of the United Stales which shall be made in pursu ance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall he made, underthc authority of the Uni ted States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws cf any State or Territory' to the contra ry notwithstanding. Tim government mated by the Constitution, and deriving its authority from the sovereign people of each of the sever- Staies.has precisely,the same right to exercise iu power over the/peoplc of all these States iu the enumerated cases, that each one of them possesses otfer /subjects not delegated to the United States,imt/teserved to the Slates re spectively, or tqitfie peofllfi. To-the extent of the delcawcdrlfowcre/Jlie' Constitution of the United StStds is al nihelliv'part of the Consti tution of each StalCjJßtid is as binding tin its people; as thouglrttjhad been actually user!- ed-fherciu. *- \ , This Government, therefore, is a great and_, f.vcrful Government, invested with all the dilutes of sovereignty over the special sub ts to which its authority extends. It may asked, then, afe the people of the Stale without redress against the tyranny and op pression of the Federal Government ? By «« means. The right of resistance on Hie part ot I the governed against the oppression of their ■ Government, cannot be denied. It exists in -1 depcmlcntiy of all constitutions, and has been i i in iiiri-ifrt nil prrHl-* of the world’s history.. rEnt the distinctlbnjnust ever be obsmru, that this is rcvolntloiNqraiust an established government, and not a 1 from it by virtue of an iuhcnffj^onstitnliouiil r *ln short, let ns look thelbngcr hßsb... faee Secession is neither more nor revolution. It majrfSr it may not bea jusltfi: tile revolution; brft still it is a revolution. What, in tbejneantime, is the responsibility and true position of the Executive? He is bound to taße care that the laws be faithfully executed jftnd from this obligation he cannot be absolved by any human power. But what if the performance of this duty in whole or in part his bceojrndered impracticable by events over whirtflie could have exercised no con troUr Such, at the present moment, is the crt£cihroughont the State Of South Carolina, •so fat as the laws of the United States secure the Administration of justice by means of the Federal Judlciarvnrc concerned. All the Fed eral officers within Its limits through whose agencies alone these laws can be carried into ex ecution, have already resigned. We no longer have a District Judged District Attorney, or Marshal, Carolina. In fact, the whole machinery of the Federal Government neces sary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people has been demolished, and it would be difficult, if not Impossible, to replace it. The only acts of Congress on the statute, book bearing on this subject arc those of pth February, I?X>, and 3d March, ISO 7. These authorize the President, after he shall have as certained that the 3larshal with his post-c com itatus is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case, to call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid him in performing this service, having first by proclamation commanded the insurgents to disperse or retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time. This duty can not by any possibility be performed In a State where no judicial authority exists to Issue process, and where there is no Marshal to exe cute it. and where even if there were such an officer, the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to cany out more effectually the objects of the Consti- still continues to be collected as heretofore at the Custom House at Charles ton, and should the Collector unfortunately resign, a successor may be appointed to per form this duty. It U not believed that any attempt will be mode to expel the Lnucd States from Its property there by .force, but \\ In this I should prove to be mistaken, the offi cers In commanu of the forts have received or ders to act strictly on the defensive. In such a contingency the responsibility for conse quences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants. . In reference to recognizing a seceding State ns an Independent government by the Presi dent, he says that would be a naked act or usurpation on his part, and it Is his duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all Its hearings. The probability of an emergency soon arising when Congress will be called on to decide the question whether it possesses power to compel a State to remain in the Union, authorizes him to express the opinion that no inch power hu been delegated to con* 200 Hoxw Starch. 100 Kega S.

It is evident that this is not among the specific and enumerated tiowers granted to Congress, and it is equally apparcnl that its not necessary ami proper fox carrying into eiccUtK'H ™yone of these powers. . . The President, declares that to make war upon a State Is at variance with the spirit of the Constitution. After having conquered a Slate, how arc we to governor It? We could nut govern it by deepotiepower, nor could we by physical force compel its people to elect a Senator and Representative, and perform all other duties appertaining to an independent Stale. The fact is that ohr. Union rests upon pub lic opinion and can never be cemented by tbc blood of its citizens shed In civil war. If it cannot live in the affections of the people, it must onc'day perish. Congress possesses ma ny means of preserving it by conciliation, but the sword is not placed In their hands to pre serve it by force; but may Ibe permitted sol emnly to invoke my countrymen to pauscand deliberate before they determine to destroy this, the grandest temple which has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began! It has been consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the glories of the part; and by the hopes of the future. The Union has already mode us the most prosperous, and ere long will,. if preserved, render us the most powerful nation on the face of the earth.' In every region of the globe the title of Ameri can citizen is held in the highest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land, it causes the hearts of our countrymen to swell With honest pride. Surely, when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss wo shall recoil with horrer from the fatal plunge. By such a dread catastrophe tbc hopes of the friends of freedom throughout the world would; be dc trojcd,and along night of leaden despotism would enshroud the nations. Our example for more than eighty years would not only be lost, hut it would be quoted as a conclusive proof that man Is untit forself government. . The slavery question, like everythin** hu man, will have its day. I firmly believe that it bng already reached and passed the culmina ting point; but if in the midst of the existing excitement the Union shall perish, the evil may then become irreparable. Congress can contribute much to avoid it by proposing and recommending to the Legislatures of the sev eral States the remedy for existing evils, which the Constitution has Itself provided for its own preservation. t , The President proposes that ids explanatory amendment to tho Constitution be adopted by Congress for the final settlement of the true construction of the Constitution on three spe cial points: Express recognition of the right of property in slaves In the States where It now exists or may hereafter exist. The duty of pro tecting this right in all the common territory throughout their territorial existence, and un til they shall be admitted as States in the Union, with or without slavery, as their Con stitutions may prescribe. A like recognition of the right of the master to have his slave who has escaped from one State to another, restored and delivered up to him; and of the validity of the Fugitive Slave law enacted for this purpose, together with a declanitionthat all Stale laws impairing or defeating this right arc a violation of the Constitution and arccon ecqucntly null and void. Such mi explanatory amendment would, it is believed, forever terminate the existing dis sensions, and restore peace and harmony among the States. , . The President then discusses our foreign re lations. Our relations with Spain have been complicated by the refusal ot the Senate to ratify the contract for the adjustment of the Cuban claim, so-called. The President reiterates his commendation for the acquisition of Cuba by a fiiir purchase. With the exception of Mexico, oar foreign re lations arc general!'" of a satisfactory character. In relation to Kansas, the President says: The desperate band recently assembled under a notorious outlaw in the southern portion of the Territory to resist the execution of the laws and plunder the peaceable citizens, will, I doubt not, be speedily subdued and brought to justice, _ . . lie recommends a Pacific Railroad, congrat ulates the country upon the apparent diminu tion of the slave trade and tho extinction of the filibustering sentiment, and in view of the destitution of Kansas, recommends to Con gress that If constitutional measures of relief can lie devised, that tho subject should be duly considered. After the reading of the message, Mr. Cline man moved to have it published, lie thought it fell short of investigating the eriss. The President elect is known to be a dangerous man, and his party would eventually control t he Government, the Supreme Court included. He did not think tho States had acted precipi tately In his judgment a number of tho States would secede within sixty days. In South Carolina the submission party was small. The wisest thing Congress can do is to divide the public property as fairly as pos sible, after paving the public debts. Mr. Crittenden replied, hoping the exam lie of the gentleman would not. oei followed. Jlcttcr not come here at all. The Union was worthy of great sacrillce and concessions. He looked forward to disunion with fear, dismay and trembling. They must search for means of reconciliation and harmony, lid hoped there would be no angry debates. North Caro lina always had carried the olive branch of approved of the desire to pro serve the Union. -When the Union ceases to protect Nor thUarolina she will bid it goodbye. * Tile usual copies were ordered printed, and the Senate adjourned.
