Today it would take 200 bushels to buy that suit. Yet had clothing been reduced in price pro portionately with corn, $60 suits of clothes would now be selling for $12. Last year 10 bushels of corn would buy a $15 pair of shoes. To day it takes 50 bushels. Last year a good pair of shoes could be bought with one cowhide. Today it takes 6- cowhides to get the shoes.

Immediate suspension by the ex- product? during the present crisis and collapse of the farmers' mar kets, as was resorted to during tha war emergency to protect the coun try from serious consequences of un restrained market manipulation. We should immediately re-estaty lish-trade relations with foreign countries and arrange credits- that will enable Europe to' buy our sur plus products. -Ultimately we should provide for a national marketing board, in which the producer wiil be represented, with power to the board to regulate the rate ot marketing and to advise and asstet in stabilizing prices, that injury -to producer or to consumer thru ruinous practices or conditions may be avoided. And finally we should see that in future adequate credit -is provided for farmers thru short-time and long-time loans, adapted fairly and practically to the pecular conditions of the farming business, to afford farmers the same credit accommoda tions now afforded other lines of business and that they may not be compelled to dump their products on a glutted or demoralized market.

A statement by one of the directors was that the bank had been aided for some time by the Federal Reserve system, but that de preciation of live Btock and grain values, and farmers refusing to sell their grain, were given as a reason for closing the doora. The amount on deposit by creditors-of the bank is not stated, but it is given out by one of the directors that the bank would probably be reorganized un der new management and reopened for business &s soon as marketing and financial conditions improve. It is said that the bank has had hard luck in the loss of considerable live stock security, and that it made liberal loans to oustomers who have not been able to repay them, up to the present time.
