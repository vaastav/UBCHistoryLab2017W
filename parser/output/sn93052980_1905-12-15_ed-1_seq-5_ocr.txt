NECTING NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK. . -- Completion of Borings Under Hudson River— One of Greatest of Engineer ing Feats. 7- After half a century of speculation on the practicability of tunneling the Hudson river from New Jersey to the island of Manhattan, it is now possi ble to walk dry-shod from Jersey to New York. The twin bores have been completed; that is, they have been cut through and cased in, though of course some finishing touches are yet to be put upon them. It was a few days ago that in the presence of the engi neers, the directors and a dozen re porters, W. G. Oakman, president of the Hudson Companies, split an old brick bulkhead with a hydraulic jack and completed the first Manhattan- Jersey tunnel system. There was a six-inch gap in, the wall. A gang of "ground hogs" rammed the breach a little wider, and the party crawled through into New York city. The old wall that was cut through •was seven feet thick. It is the relic of a former failure to tunnel the Hudson. Twenty-three years ago the engineers of the old Hudson Company, after cutting a considerable distance under the river, abandoned the enter prise and walled in the unfinished work with this brick bulkhead. ■ Two tube-tunnels run parallel be neath the Hudson river, the work of boring them being done under direc tion of the New York and New Jer sey Railroad Company, but this com pany entrusted the actual performance of the work to the Hudson Companies. The present, tube has been two years in the course- of construction. The tubes will cost when completed about $13,000,000,' and the entire work will cost about $30,000,000. Fifteen Feet in Diameter. The tubes are 5,700 feet long, 15% feet in diameter and are intended for one track each, with a sidewalk for workmen. Two tubes have been start ed on the New Jersey shore, to run under the river to ,Cortlandt and Church streets. These tubes will be 16% feet in diameter. The tubes just completed will connect on the New Jersey shore with the Pennsylvania and the Lackawanna terminals. In Manhattan one branch will connect •with the subway under Fourth ave nue at Astor Place. Another branch will run to Sixth avenue and Thirty third street A trip through the entire length of the tunnel from the subway to Hoboken -will cost only five cents. About six hundred men have been em ployed in the tunnels. Cars will be running through these tube-tunnels in eighteen months. The eafety of transportation in the tunnel needs no demonstration, for trains will run in a steel tube the strength of which to resist pressure has been care fully worked out. Being laid from fifteen to fifty feet below the river bed, It cannot be affected by the ac tion of tidewater. The tube is a steel lined hole in the earth, and except for THE

TURKEY STUFFING ? Christmas Dinner Incomplete With out This Ol d-Fash.oned Addition. The latest and most obnoxious crank in th gastronomic line is that deluded epicure who asserts that Christmas turkey must be served without "stuffing." He says it is an anomaly, a thing without reason, an insult to the completeness of the bird. He even declares that it de tracts from the sweet flavor and deli* cate aroma of the king of. fowls. Thus he thrusts himself into the pub li'.- arena,' a most unwelcome '•butter in," striving to accomplish the down fall of an historic institution. He is not a true American. He has never tasted "stuffing as mother made it" —the real Simon-pure article, spooned out of the deep recesses of the royal bird in great crumbly masses that fill the room with rich aroma and the heart of man, woman and child with joy unconfined. :,, . ■ It is the soul of the turkey, Is stuff ing. With the bird itself one is al ways bothered about what part he will have— whether white meat or dark; whether a wing, a thigh, or a drumstick; whether the wish-bone, the liver, or "the part that went over the fence last;" but for the stuffing, American ..sentiment is universal. The only question Js: How much does one dare to eat? And then that en trancing, sagey odor, from the mys terious "yarbs" that enter into the mak ing—as sweet -as the summer breezes over new mown hay— as delicate as the fragrance of orange blossoms on a wedding day. And perchance, in addition, we shall catch the sublime suggestion of an onion, wafted into our quivering nostrils, . and recalling some dear departed maternal ' spirit who ministered to -our boyish wants in days of yore. Turkey straight, without stuffing? Not while there is, breath to sound a protest. It is the mission of civiliza tion to mix with naked nature the toothsome miscellany of tradition; to blend the -work of nature and man; to sweeten with our best endeavor the plain blessings of an all-wise Providence. That's what gave us "stuffing;" and until the heart of man grows cold,— until the race loses its teeth and lives on pills and tablets and predigested pap, • its < multitudes will insist on turkey as mother served it. Down with theories. Give as stuffing or take the turkey back. of the hangings are row after low of tiny monkey skulls, the eye sockets of which are illumined with electric lights. The "divine Sarah" has parted with her pet tiger, and now has for a com panion a large and ugly baboon, whose ears have been pierced so that they may carry huge rings of solid gold. Bernhardt is said to look as young as she did twenty years ago. Her face is without wrinkles, and her step is as spry and her manner as vivacious as when she first electrified her native city as an actress. JACKSON; AMADOR COUNTY, CAL., DEC, 15, 1905. FORTUNE FOR A ROSE. A WONDERFUL NEW VARIETY WHICH BRINGS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. Is a Ravishing Pink and Crimson Tea —One to Two Hundred 'IhousanJ Dollars Expected Prof it— Other Huge Figures for Flowers. i■ A Washington gardener has origi nated what is believed by expert flor ists to be the finest rose ever grown — tlie Queen Beatrice. It is a tea of a peculiar shade of pink with a touch, in the bud, of light crimson. Its par ticular merit lies probably in the fact that none of the beauty of its coloring is destroyed "either in natural or arti ficial light Added to this it has a fragrance equal to, if not superior to that of the American Beauty. The rose, grows on straight and Stur dy stems from two to three feet long; its parents are the two well-known va THE NEW QUEEN BEATRICE ROSE. rieties, Liberty and Madam Chatenay, the former, one of the most popular crimson varieties, but uncertain in the production of perfect blooms. Queen Beatrice has none of the faults of its parents and combines all of their good qualities; it is resistant to insect and mildew attacks, and capable of forc ing on the hothouse bench. Grown at Gardiner Hubbard Mansion It was originated by Peter Bissett, and will be put on the market by Florist F. H. Kramer, of Washington. Bissett is the head gardener of Mrs. Gardiner Hubbard, the widow of the late Gardiner Hubbard, at one time president of the National Geographic Society. She is the mother-in-law of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone. The new rose was produced at her beautiful suburban residence, Twin Oaks, just outside of the national capital. The leading florists of the country have known of the existence of this rose for a year and have made various tempting offers for it, but it remained for Florist Kramer to offer $30,000 and finally secure the beauty. Such a fabulous sum for a rose seems insignificant, however, when it is remembered that but a few years ago Thomas Lawson of "Frenzied Fi nance" fame paid $30,000 for a mere carnation, while the greater amount of $125,000 was expended for the "Fi ancee" carnation. It is .hinted that Mr. Lawson cleaned up over $100,000 out of the Lawson pink and the buy ers of the "Fiancee" carnation easily doubled the amount expended. < Origin of the American Beauty. And yet the "American Beauty" of whom every flower lover is fond has a very, very sad history. A number of years ago a Washington gardener who made only a specialty of garden roses, received from abroad a ship ment of plants, among which was a "mongrel." This, with out-of-door cul ture produced very large and fragrant blooms.. It attracted the attention of Thomas .Fields, a Washington florist. Nothing was known by him of tho forcing qualities of this rose in the greenhov.se, but as he rather liked Its color and general appearance, one af ternoon whilo her husband was ab sent, he purchased the single plant from Mrs. Ready for five dollars. Ready, when he retnred and was told of the sale, believed that his wife had asked too much for the flower. Fields experimented with the plant and found thnt it exceeded even his fondest hopes. He named it the "American Beauty" and probably cleared $25,000 on this one deal. To-dny Ready is still a gardener, doing odd jobs for peo ple around town— spading up gardens, supplying rich earth and planting shrubs. - Mr. Kramer is a Washington florist with large experience in the flower line, many new and interesting nov elties having originated in his green houses. Among the popular garden roses which he produced are the "Climbing Meteor," a climbing varie ty with large red blooms; "Champion of the World," "Robert E. Lee," "F. H.. Kramer," and many other sorts which have been sold to catalogue houses and named by them. He has just originated the "Climbing Ameri can Beauty" which will probably be listed by flower-sellers next spring. He recently exhibited in Washington the "F. H. Kramer" carnation— a deep pink sort-r-whieh many well-known florists have declared to be the equal of either the "Lawson" or "Fiancee." He ■ states that no plants of the '•Queen Beatrice" rose will be ready for distribution before the spring of 1907 during which. time a large sum of money will he expended in the erection of hothouses and the cultiva tion and growing of .hundreds of thousands of young plants. The es timate is made that probably $150,000 or $200,000 will be made from this flower. Attempted Graftings. Various artifices have been tried by clever but unscrupulous people to ob tain specimens of the "Queen Beat rice" rose, many cdming into the Kramer establishment where a huge bouquet of the blooms was on exhibi tion, offering to . purchase at large prices a single flower for a bouton niere. Others have gone so far as to order elaborate funeral designs with the proviso that nothing but this par ticular kind of rose be used. These were only dodges to obtain the healthy wood for slipping and growing, for the best time to make rose cuttings is either just before or immediately after the plant comes into bloom. One Washington florist who origi nated the "Ivory" rose — a handsome white flower, and a sport of "Golden Gate"— was unwise enough to sell cut flowers, thereby enabling the purcha sers to propagate the variety cheaply. The Washington Florists' Club re-, cently awarded the new "Queen Beat rice" rose a certificate of merit, the first of the kind ever given by the club. The new flower is so striking and • beautiful that every member of the club consented to the award. Comfort on Uncle Sam's Ample Breast. "Cupid Is. one of the best recruiting officers that Uncle Sam has," confided one of the sergeants attached to the recruiting headquarters. "Back of nearly every enlistment there is a woman in the case. - Lovers' quarrels chase a lot of fine lads into the serv ice. Your romantic youth gravitates to the recruiting ofl3ce after a serious break with his sweetheart as naturally as a duck takes to water. 'It seems to him the most fitting way in which to sacrifice himself when love's young dream is apparently dispelled. Way down In his. heart he nurses the idea of making his erstwhile inamorata pad, and it's the army or navy, with the possibility of death in battle, for him. Again, other first class material is recruited by the desire of young fellows to sport a uniform before their girls. In such cases Cupid does his recruiting through vanity. But in both ways he manages to fill up big gaps in the ranks of Uncle Sam's fighters." ' One of the richest boys in the world is the adopted son of the late million aire, Zeigler. He is fourteen years old and will inherit nearly ? 20,000,000. Edwin Booth for a long time aver aged twenty-five cigars each day. THE 

PUBLIC LAND FRAUDS. PRESIDENTS PUBLIC LAND COMMISSION RECOM MENDS RADICAL CHANGES IN LAWS. ?=•£• Three men went out west to seek their ' fortunes. One located in the Middle West— not the Middle West perhaps; as It is _ generally known, but the central section of the west ern half of the United States— in the desert country. He started his suc cessful career by taking up a govern ment claim under the desert-land act He was in the cattle country— the cow~ country— and he made his strike hi cattle. • ■ . -■; His friend went further north, still in the desert area, close to the Cana dian line— in the sheep country. He took up a government homestead claim and commuted it The third man went into the far northwest— the Oregon country of Lewis and Clarke— and he took up a" government timber claim. He located in a land where lumbering was done. And these three men became great cattle and sheep and timber kings, and incidentally landlords; and their operations- while widely different were singularly similar. They filed on their government claims and at the earliest • possible moment each man "proved up and sold out" for cash to larger land grabbers." And so they learned the. mode and got their start toward land grabbing themselves. The desert entryman was supposed under the law to live at least three years on his 320 acres and to expend during that period $960 in construct ing irrigation ditches and other Im provements, and make it his home. This was what was promised .for the law when it was slipped through Congress. Aa a matter of fact, this man spent a day with a team making a fake irrigation reservoir and .then another day running a couple of fur rows around the land, making oath that this constituted an irrigation system for its . reclamation. Then within six months *he "proved up," made the required 'payments to the government, and secured a patent to his land. The homestead entryman, who, un der the law, must reside continuously on his claim, erected a slab, one-room shanty, 10x12 feet ,and during a per iod of fourteen months slept in it just five times. This was the extent of his home making. Then he, too, made oath of what he had not done, offered the required payments to the govern ment and secured title to his land. The timber entryman went into the finest timber-section of the United States— the dense forests of the far northwest— and under the timber and stone act selected 160 acres of land, the timber standing upon which was worth $75 an acre, and- swearing that he wanted it for his own personal use, purchased it from the government at the fixed price of $2.50 an acre and Immediately disposed of it So that within fourteen months these three men had secured from Uncle Sam an aggregate of one square mile of gov ernment land for their own benefit and use as homes, and sold it out to

No nation has ever been so reckless or has been so mercilessly robbed of its . public land resources as has the United States. Since the early history of the republic, land in vast tracts has been granted to individuals and cor porations, and in spite of the public attention which of late years has been directed to the matter, the absorption goes on at an alarming rate. It seems difficult for the man who has lived in the west for years to realize - that there is any good reason why ho should. not debauch and buy out hun- - dreds of others who are willing to sell their birthright as American citizens, thus enabling him to acquire a do main which ->vould have been princely in the days of feudalism.
