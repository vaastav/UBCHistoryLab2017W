" 'FSLDAY. DECEMBER 10, 1869. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To the Senate and House of Representatives. Hi Io coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate of this great nation, it is with gratitude to the giv erofill good for the many benefit1 we enjoy. "We are blessed with peace , ; - at home, and are without entangling - ' alliances abroad to forebode trouble, with a territory unsurpassed in fertil ity, of an area equal to the abundant upport of 500,000,000 of people, and abounding in every varitty of useful -'- 1 minerals in quantity sufficient to 6up- ply the world for generations; with exuberant crops ; with a rariety of climate adapted to the production of every species of earth's riches, and - -'suited to the. haiiU, tastes and re "': -Vqdirementa 4f every living thing; ; . 'with a population of forty millions of t free people, alt speaking one language; ", AwitL facilitis foe every mortal to ae quire an education with institutions closing to cone the avenues to fame or any blessing or fortune that may o b coveted f wH freedom of the pul ''"'pit, the press ' and the school; with a revenue flowing into the na tional treasury beyond the menta of the government ) ; Harmony is "teing rapidly require supply restored - within our own borders, manufactures - hitherto unknown in our country are springing up. in all directions, pro- dacine a degree of national indepen dence unequalled by that of any oth ; er forei.: i These blessings and count less others are entrusted to your care, - and more for safe keeping for the brief period ef your tenure of office. : ' la a abort time we most each . of us ; return to the ranks of . the people, who have conferred upon us our hon ors, and account to them for our stewardship. I earnestly desire that neither you nor I may be condemned by a free and enlightened constituency,- nor by our own consciences. 

RECONSTRUCTION. f i Emerging from a rebellion of gi , gantio magnitude, aided, as it was, by the sympathy and assistance of na tions' with which we were at peace, eleven States of the Union were, four - years ago, left - without a legal state government, a national debt had been , contracted, American commerce was almost driven from the seas, the in dustry of one-half of the country had been taken from the control of the capitalist and placed where all labor ; rightfully belongs, in the keeping of the laborer. The works of restoring state governments loyal to the Union, of protecting and fostering free labor and ' providing means for paying the interest on the publio debt, has re . ceived ample attention from Con gress.;: Although your . efforts have not met witk the success in all par . tieulars that might havt . been desir , ed, jet, on the whole, they have been "more successful than could have been reasonably anticipated. Seven states , which passed ordinances of secession have been fully restored to their places in the Union. The eighth, Georgia, held an election at which she ratified her constitution, republi can in form, elected a governor, mem bers of Congress," a state legislature and all other officers required. The governor was duly installed, and the legislature met fend performed all the aetfi required of them by the re construction acts.of Congress. Sub- c. seauentlv. however, in violation of the constitution which they had just ratified, as since decided by ; the su preme court ol the state, thsy unseat ed the colored members of the legis lature and admitted to seats some members who are disqualified by the third clause of the fourteenth amend ment to the constitution, an article which they themselves had contribut ed to ratifv. Under .these circam- stanees, I would submit to you wheth er it would not he wise witnout de lay to enact a law authorizing the goyernor ef ..Georgia ;to convene the "members originally elected to the leg s viBlature, requiring each member to take the oath prescribed by the re construction act and none to be ad ' mitted' who are ineligible under the third clause of the fourteenth amend- . ment.; The freedmen, under the pro--"tection which they have received, are .-caakinfr' rapid progress in learning, and no oomplainta are heard of any lack of industry on their part when they receive fair renumeration for their labor. .- LOSS TO AMERICAN COMMERCE. W i The means provided for paying the interest oa the public debt, with all the other expenses of the goverment, sre more thanamnls.. The. loss of i.tir; commerce ia me cniy result oi the late rebellion which has not re-r ceived sufficient attention from you, To this subject I shall call your earn est attention. I will not now sug gest plans by which this object may be effected, but will, if necessary, make it the subject cf a special mes - sage during the session of Congres. VIRGINIA, MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS. At the March term, Congress by joint resolution, authorized the exec utive to order elections in the 6tates of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas, to submit to them the constitutions which each had previously, v in con vention, framed, and submit the con stitation, either entire or in separata parts, to be voted upon at toe discre tion of tho Executive. Under this authority elections were called. In " Virginia the election took place on the 6th of July, 1869. The governor and lieutenant governor elected have been installed, the legislature met and did all, required by this resolu tion and by all the . reconstruction ' .acts of Congress, and . abstained from -all doubtful authority. I recommend that her Senators and Representa- ' tires be admitted, and that the state . be fully restored to its place in the family of states. Elections were call ed in Mississippi and Texas to com mence on the 30th of November, . IS69, and to last two days in Missis. sippi, and four days in lexas. at elections have taken place but their result is not known. It is to be hop ed that the acts of the legislatures of these states, when they meet, will be ; euch as will meet your approval, and thus close the work of reconstruction. THE RETURN TO SPECIE PAYMENT. Among the evils growing out of the rebellion and not yet referred to is that pf'au irredeemable currency, , It is an evil which I hope will receive your most earnest attention. It is a dutyt and one , of the highest duties of the government, to secure to the citizens a medium of exchange of fix ed, unvarying value. This implies a return to a specie basis, and no sub stitute for it can be devised. It should be commenced now and reach- - ed at the earliest practicable moment, . consistent with a fair regard to the interest of the debtor class. Imme- 7' diate resumption of speaie payment if practicable would not be desirable, ' it would compel the debtor class to fay beyond their contracts th pre mium on '. gold at the ' date cf their puiehasa, and would bring bankrupt cy and ruin to thousands. Fluetua- tiocs, howerer. in the paper valu" of the measure of all values, gold, is detrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the man of business aa in voluntary gambler, for ia all sales when future payment is to be made, both parties "peculate as to what wi:l bo the value of the currency to be raid and received. I earnestly re- commend to you, i a. - . then, such legisla- tioc as Trill mEHrt a gradual return a rrmarti n I TiTltsSTl I TT TT1 W r L. mj AIM j- - diate stop to the fluctuation in the value of currency. The methods to secure these results are as numerous as are the speculators on political economy. To secure the latter I sec but one way, and that is to au thorize the treasury to redeem its own paper at a fixed price whenever presented; to withhold from circula tion all such currency redeemed un til sold again for gold. The vast re sources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, ought to make our credit the best on earth. With a less burden of taxation than the citizen has endured for six years past, the entire publio debt could be paid in ten years; but it is not desirable that the people should be taxed to pay it in that time. Tear by year the abil ity to pay .increases in a rapid ratio, but the burden of interest ought to be reduced as rapidly as can be done without violation of the contract. The publio debt is represented in great part by bonds having from five to twenty and from ten tD lorty years to run, bearing interest at the rate of six per cent, and fire per cent, respec tively. It is optional with the gov ernment to pay their bonds at any period after, the expiration of the last time mentioned upon their face. The time has already expired when a great part of them may be taken up. The time is rapidly approaching when all, it is believed, that are now due dit be replaced bv bonds bearing a rate of interest not exceeding four and a half per cent, and as rapidly as the remainder become due that they may be replaced in the same way. . To accomplish this, it may be neeessary to authorize the interest to be paid at either of the three or four of the money centers of Europe, or by any assistant treasurer of the United States, at the option of the holder of the bonds. I suggest this subject for the consideration of Con gress. Also simultaneously with this, the propriety of redeeming our currency as before suggested at its mtrket value at the time the law goes into effect, increasing the rate at which the currency will be bought and sold from day to day, or week to week, at the same rate of interest as the gov ernment pays upon its bonds. THE TARIFF AND INTERNAL REVENUE. The subject of the tariff and inter nal taxation will necessarily receive your attention. . The revenues of the eountry are greater than the require ments, and may with safety be reduc ed ; but as tho funding of the debt in a four or a four and a half per cent would reduce the annual current ex penses largely, thus, after fundinz, justifying a greater reduction of tax ation than would bs now expedient, I su-rjrest the postponement of this auestion until the next meeting of Congress. It may be advisable to modify taxation and the tariff in in stances where unjust or burdensome discriminations are made by the pres ent laws, but a general revision of the laws regulating this subject 1 rec commend the postponement of for the present I also suggest the renewal of the tax on incomes, but at a reduc ed rate, say of three per cent, and this tax to expire in three years. With the funding of the national debt, as here suggested, I feel safe in saying that tne tax irom revenues and imports may be reduced safely from sixty to eighty millions per an num at once, and still further reduc ed from year to year, as the resources of the country are developed. THE 

TREASURY. The report of the secretary of the treasury shows the receipts of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30,7 169, to be 8370,943,747, anLthe expenditures, including in terest bounties &c, to be 8321,390, 597.' The estimates for the ensuing year are more favorable to the gov ernment, and will no doubt show i large decrease in the public debt. The receipts of the treasury, beyond exnenditures. have exceeded the amount neoessary to place to the sink ing fund, as - provided by law. To lock up the surplus in the treasury and' withhold it from circulation would lead to such contraction of the currency as to cripple trade and se riously affect the prosperity of the country. Under these circumstances the secretary of the treasury and my self heartily concurred in the pro priety of using all the Burplus cur rency in the treasury in the purchas ing of government bonds, thus re ducing the interest bearing debt of the country and of submitting to Congress the'question of disposition to be made of the bonds so purchased. The bonds now held by the treasury amount to about S75.000.000, includ ing those belonging to the sinking fund; I recommend that the whole be placed to the credit of the sinking fund. Your attention is respectfully invited to the recommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury for the creation of the office of commissioner of customs revenue, for the increase of salary to certain classes of officials and the substitution of increased na tional bond circulation to replace the outstanding three per cent, certin cates : and most especially to his recommendation for the repeal of laws allowing shares of fines, penal ties, forfeitures, etc., to officers of the government or to informers, lhe of fice of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is one of the most and responsible under the ment. It falls but little, arduous govern- if any lft 0f a cabinet position in its im portance and responsibilities. 1 would ask for it, therefore, such leg islation as in your judgment will place the office on a footing of digni ty commensurate with its importance and with character and qualifications of the class nf men required to fill it properly. THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA. As the United States is the freest of all nations, bo too its people sym pathize with all people struggling for liberty and self goverment. But whPe so sympathizing, it is due to our honor that we -should abstain from forcing our views upon unwill ing nations and in taking an interest ed part "without invitation io the quarrels betwesa different nations or between governments and their sub jects. Our course should always'be in conformity with strict justice and law, international and locaL Such has been the policy of the administra tion in dealing with these questions. For more than a year a valuable pro vmce in bpain. and a near neignoor of ours, in whom all our people can not but feel a deep interest, has been struggling for independence and free dom. The people and government of the United States entertain the same warm feelings and sympathies for the people of Cuba, in their pend in struggle, that they manifiested throughout the previous struggles between Spain and her former colo nies in behalf of the latter; but the contest at no time assumed the con ditions which amount to a war in the sense of international law, or which would show the existence of a de facto political organization of the insur gents sufficient to justify recogni tion of belligerency. .The principle is maintained, however, that this na tion ia its own judge when to accord the rights of belligerency, either to a people struggling to free themselves from a government they believe to bs oppressive, or to independent nations at war with other. The United Slates have no disposition to inter fere with the existing relations of Fpain ta her colonial possessions on this continent. They believe that in uue time Spain and other European powers vfill find their interest in ter minating those relations and estab lishing their present dependencies a independent powers members of the family of rations. These dependenc ies are no longer regarded as subject to transfer from one European power to another. When the present rala tions of colonies eeasa they are to be come independent powers, exercising the right of ehoice and of self control in the determination of their future condition and relations with thero powers. The United States, in order to put a stop to bloodshed in Cuba, and iu the interest of a neighboring people, propesed their good offices to bring the existing contest to a termi nation. The offer, not being accept ed by Spain on a basis which we be lieved could be received by Cuba, was withdrawn. It is hoped that the good office of the United States may yet prove advantageous for the settle ment of the unhappy etntc. .Mean while a number of illegal expeditions against Cuba have been broken up. It has been the endeavor of the ad ministration to execute the neutrality laws in good faith, no matter how un pleasant the task, made so by the suffering we have endured from lack of like good faith towards us by other nations. The United States schooner Lizzie Majorwas arrested on the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two passengers taken from it and carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representa tions of these facts were made to the Spanish government as soon as of ficial information of them reached Washington. The two passengers were set at liberty, and the spanisn government assured the United States that the oaptain of the frigate in making the capture bad acted witn out law; that he had been reprrmand- ed for the irregularity of his conduct, and that the Spanish aumonties in Cuba would not sanction any act that could violate the rights or treat with disrespect the sovereignty of this na tion. The question of the seizure of the brig Mary Lowell, at one of the Ba hama Islands, by the Spanish author ities, is now the subject of correspon dence between this government and thoBe of Spam and Great Britain. The Captain ueneral ot Luna, about May last issued a proclamation authorizing search to be made of ves sels on the high seas. An immediate remocstrance was made against this, whereupon the captain-general issued a new proclamation, limiting the right of search of vessels of the United States, so far as authorized under the treaty of 1795. This proclamation, however, was immediately withdrawn. I have always felt that the most inti mate relation should be cultivated between the republic of the United Statese and all independent nations on this continent It may be well worth considering whether new treat ies between us and them may not be profitably entered into to secure more intimate relations, friendly, commer cial and otherwise- THE 

DARIEN CANAL. an ca nal to connect tho Atlantic and Pa cific oceans through the Isthmus of Darien is one in which commerce is greatly interested. Instructions have been given to our minister to the .Re public of the United States of Co lumbia to endeavor to obtain author- itv for a survev bv this eovernment j j i' in order to determine the practicabili- ty of Bucn an undertaiung, and a charter for the right of way to build by private enterprise sucn wont u the survey proveB it to be practica ble. In order to comply with the agreement of the United States as to a mixed commission at Lima, for the adjustment of claims, it became nec essary to send a commissioner and secretary to Lima in August last. No appropriation having been made by Congress for this purpose, it is now asked that one be made, cover ing the past and future expenses of the commission. MEDIATION BETWEEN SPAIN AND PERU. The - good offices of the United States to bring about a peace between Spain and the South American re publics with which she is at war, hav ing been accepted by Spain, Peru and Chili, a congress has been invited to be held in Washington during the present winter. A grant has been given to Europeans of an exclusive right of transit over the territory of Nicaragua, to which Costa Rica has given its assent, which, it is alleged, conflicts with vested rights of the citizens of the United States. The department of state has now this sub ject under consideration. THE 

SPANISH GUNBOATS. having made representations that there was a state of war between Peru and Spain, and that Spain was constructing in and near New ' York thirty gunboats, which might be used by Spain in such a way as to relieve the naval force at Cuba so as to operate against Peru, orders were given to prevent their departure. No further steps having been taken by the represen tative of tho Peruvian government to prevent the departure of these ves sel.!, and I not feeling authorized to detain the property of a nation with which we are at peace on a mere exe cutive order, the matter has been re ferred to the courts to decide. The conduct of the war between the Al lies and Republic of Paraguay has made our intercourse with that coun try so difficult that it has been deme ed advisable to withdraw our repre sentative from there. THE ALABAMA CLAIMS. Toward the close of the last admin istration a convention was signed at London for the settlement of all out standing claims between Great Brit ian and the United States, which failed to receive the advice and con-1 sent of the Senate to its ratification The time and the circumstances at tend' ng the negotiation of the treaty were favorable to its acceptance by the people of the United States, hut its provisions were wholly inadequate for the iettlement of the grave wrongs that had been sustained by this gov ernment as well as bv its citizens The injuries resulting to tho United States by reason of the course adopt cd by Great Britain during our late civil war increased tno rates oi in surance, in the diminution ot exports and imports, and other obstructions to domestic industry and production, in its effect upon the foreign com merce of the country, in the decrease and transfer to Great Britain of our commercial marine, in the prolonga tion of the war, and increased cost both in treasure and in lines of its suppression, could not be adjusted and satisfied as ordinary commercial claims which continually arise be tween commercial nations; and yet the convention treated them simply as such ordinary claims, from which they differ more widely in the gravi ty of their characler than in the mag nitude of their amount. Great even as is that difference, no word was found in the treaty and not an in ference could be drawn from it to re move the sense of unfriendless of the course of Great Britain in our strug gle for existence, which had bo deep ly and seriously impressed itself upon the people of this country. Believ ing that a convention thus miscon ceived in its scope and inadequate in its provisions would not have pro-j duced the cordial settlement of pen- ding questions which alone is con- siitent with the relations which I de- to have established between the and Great Britain, I resardad the action cf the Senate in rejecting the treaty, .to have been! wisely taken in the interest of peace a3 a necessary step in the direc- jtionofa perfect and cordial friend-! ship between the two countries A 'sensitive peopla conscious cf their power are more at ease under a great wrong, wholly unatoned, tnanunaer, the restraint of a settlement whicn satisfies neither their ideas of justice aor tfceir grave sense oi me gnev- ance they have sustained. The re- jection of the treaty was. followed by a state of public feeling on both sides which I thought not favorable to an immediate attemct at 'a renewal cf the negotiations. I accordingly so instructed our minister to Great Brit ain, and found that my views in this regard were shared by Her Majesty's ministers. I hope that the time may soon arrive when the two govern ments can approach the solution ef this momentous question with an as surance of what is due to the rights and dignity and honor of each, and with the determination not only to remove the causes of complaint in the past but to lay the foundation of a broad principle of public law which will prevent future differences, and tend to firm and continued peace and friendship. This is now the only grave question, which the United States has with any foreign nation. RECIPROCITY WITH CANADA. The question of a treaty for recip rocity between the United States and the British provinces on this conti nent has not been favorably consider ed by the administration. The ad vantages of such a treaty would be wholly in favor of the British produc er except, possibly, a few engaged in the trade between the two sections. No citizen of the United States would bo benefited by reciprocity. Our in ternal taxation would prove a protec tion to the British producer almost equal to the protection which our man ufacturers now receive from the tariff. Some arrangement, howeyer, for the regulation of commercial intercourse between the United StateB and the Dominion of Canada, may be desirable. OTHER RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN. The commission for adjusting the claims of the Hudson Bay and Puget's Sound agricultural company upon the United States has terminated its la bors : the award of $650,000 has been made, and all the rights and titles of the company in the territory ot tne United States have been extinguished. Deeds for the property of the com pany have been received. An appro priation by Congress to meet this sum is asked. . The commissioners for determin ing the northwestern land boundary between the Uuited States and the British possessions, under the treaty of 1856, have completed their labors, and the commission dissolved. In conformity with the reoommend ation of Congress, a proposition was early made to the British govern ment to abolish the mixed courts created under the treaty of April 7, 1862, for the suppression of the slave trade. The subject is still under negotiation. THE FRENCH CABLE. It having come to my knowledge that a corporate company, organized under British laws, proposed to land upon the shores of the United States, and to operate there, a sub-marine cable under a concession from His Majesty, the emperor of the French, of an exclusive right for twenty years of telegraphic communication between the shore of France and the United States, with the very objectionable feature of subjecting all -messages conveyed thereby to the sovereignty and the control of the French and British legations at Washington to be made acquainted'with the probable poliey of Congress on this subject, as foreshadowed by the bill which pass ed the senate in March last This drew from the representatives of the company an agreement to accept as the basis of their operations the pro visions of the bill or such enactment on the subject as'might be passed du ring the approaching session of Con gress ; also to use their influence to secure from the French government a modification of their concession so as to permit the landing upon French soil of any cable belonging to any company incorporated by the author ity of the United States, or of any State iu the Union, and on their part not to oppose the establishment of any such cable. In consideration of this agreement I directed the with drawal of all opposition by th6 United States authorities to the landing of the cable and to the working of it until the meeting of Congress. . I re gret to say that there has been no modification made in the company's concession, nor so far as I can learn have they attempted ta secure one. Their concession excludes the capital and the citizens ot the United States from competition upon the shores of France. I recommend legislation to protect the rights of citizens of the United States as well a3 the dignity and sovereignty of the nation against such an assumption. I shall also en deavor to secure, by negotiation, an abandonment of the principle of mo nopolies ia Ocean telegraphic cables. Copies of this correspondence is here with famished. NATURALIZATION. other countries, less fortunate than our own, sometimes induce their citi zens to come to the United States for the sole purpose of becoming natural ized. Having secured this, they re turn to their native country and re side there without disclosing their change of allegiance. They aocept official positions of trust or honor which can only be held by citizens of their native land; they journey under passports describing them as such citizens, and it is only when civil dis cord, after perhaps years of quiet, threatens their persons or their prop erty, or when their native state drafts them into its military service, that the fact of their allegiance is made known. They reside permanently from the United States ; they con tribute nothing to its reenues, avoid the duties of its citizenship, and they only mate tnemselves Known by a claim of protection. I have directed the diplomatic and consular efficers of the United States to scrutinize car fully a'.l such claims of protection, The citizen of the United States, whether native or adopted, who dis charges his duty to hi3 country, is entitled to its complete protection. While I have a voice in the direction of affairs I Bhall not consent to in fringe the Bacred right by conferring it upon fictitious or fraudulent claimants. PROTECTION OF IMMIGRANTS. On the accession of the present ad ministration, in was found that the minister for North Germany had made applications for the protection of em igrant passengers to which no re sponse had been given. It was con cluded that to be effectual all the ma ritime powers engaged in the trade should join in the measure. Invita tions have baen extended to the cabi nets of London, Paris, Florence, Ber lin, Brussels, the Hague, Copenhagen, and Stockholm to empower their rep resentative! at Washington to simul taneously enter into the nego tiation and to conclude with the ' Unite! States conventions identical in form, m-king uniform regulations m to the couatruclion of the parts of j vessils to be devoted to the use of ( emigrant passengers, as ta the quali sire I ty andqaanty offood, as to the med UnitcdStatei ical treatment of the sick, and as to the rules to be observed during the voyage in order to secure ventilation, ; to promote health, to - prevent iatru snd i sion, and to protect the females, and providing for the establishment of j tribunals in the several countries for ; enforcing such regulations by snm i j mary process. 

RUSSIAN HEMP. ; lour attention is respecuuny cau- ed to the law regulating the tariff on Russian heme, aad to the auestion j wnether to fix the chargeB on Russian j temp t;ter thaa they are fixed upon Afan;'!a.wi3 not a violation cf our j treaty witQ TUS5j, placing her pro ducts upon the same footing with those of the most favored nations. MANUFACTURES. Uur manufactures are increasing with wonderful rapidity under the encouragement which they now re ceive, with the improvements in ma chinery already effected and still in creasing, causing machinery to take the place of skilled labor. To a large extent our imports of many articles must fall off largely within a very f e years. Fortunately, too, manufac tures are not confined to a few locali ties, as- formerly, and it is hoped will become more and more diffused, mak ing the interest in them equal in all sections. They give employmeat and support to hundreds of thousands of people at home, and retain with ns the means which otherwise would be shipped abroad. The extension of railroads in Eu rope and the cast is bringing into competition with our agricultural products like products of others coun tries. Self-interest,- if not self-preservation, thereforc,dictatates caution against disturbing any industrial in terest of the eountry. It teaches us, also, the necessity of looking to oth er markets for the sale of our sup plies. Oar neighbors south of us and China and Japan should receive our special attention. It will be the endeavor of the administration to cul tivate such relations, with : all these nations as to entitle ns to their con fidence, and make it their interest as well as ours to establish better com mercial relations. a RELATIONS WITH CHINA. Through the agency of a more en lightened policy than that heretofore pursued toward China, largely due to the sagacity and. efforts ofone of our own distinguished citizens, the world U about to commence largely increas ed relations with that populous and hitherto exclusive nation. As the United States have been the iuuatory in the new policy so they should be the most earnest in showing their good faith in making it a success. In this connection I advise such legisla tion as will forever preclude the en slavement of the Chinese upon . our soil under the name of coolies, and also prevent American vessels from engaging in the transportation : of coolies to any country tolerating the system. I also recommend that the mission to China be raised to one of the first class. " is THREE ESSENTIALS. On my assuming the responsibilit ies of Chief Magistrate of the United States it was with the conviction that three things were essential to its peace, prosperity and fullest develop ment. First among these is strict integrity in fullfilling all our obliga tions; second, to secure protection the persons and property of citizens of the United States in each and ev-J ery portion of our common country, wherever they may choose to move, without reference to original nation ality, religion, color or politics, de manding of him only obedience to the laws, and proper respect of the rights of others; third, the union of all of the states with equal rights inde structible by any unconstitutional means. To secure the first of these, Congress has taken two essential steps: first,' in declaring, by joint resolution, that tho public debt should be paid, both principal and interest, in coin; second, by providing the means for paying the same. Pro viding the means however, could not secure the object desired without a proper administration of laws for tho collection of the revenues and econo mical disbursement : of them. To this subject the administration has most earnestly addressed itself, with results, I believe, satisfactory to the country. Thero has been nj hesita tion in changing officials in order to secure efficient execution of the law, sometimes, too, where, in a mere par ty view, undesirable political results were likely to follow from acy hesita tion in sustaining efficient officials against remonstances wholly political. For the second requisite to our growth i and prosperity, a true and firm, but humane administration of existing laws, amended from time to time as they may prove ineffective or harsh and unnecessary, are probab ly all that are required. The third cannol be 'attained by special legisla tion, bui must be regarded as fixed by the constitution itself and gradually acquiesced io by the force of public opinion. THE TENURE OF OFFICE. .It may be well to mention here the embarrassments possible to arise from leaving on the statute books the so-called "tenure of office act," and I earnestly recommend its total repeal. It could not have been the intention of the framers of the constitution, when providing that appointments made by the President should receive the con sent of the Senate, that the latter should have. the poyer to retain in office persons placed there by Fed eral appointment against the will of the President. The law is incon sistent with a faithful and efficient administration of tho government. What faith can the Executive put in' officials - forced upon him, and these,' too,whom he ha3 suspended for reason? How will such officials be likely to serve an administration which they know docs not trust them? if 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. From the foundation of the govern ment to the present time, the manage ment of the original inhabitants of this continent, the Indians, has been a subject of embarrassment and ex pense, and it has been attended with continuous robberies, murders and wars, t rom niy own ezpeneuce upon the frontiers and in Indian countries I do not hold either legislation or the conduct of the whites who come most in contact with the Indians blameless for these hostilities. The past, how ever, cannot be undone, and the ques tion must be met as we now find it. I have attempted a new policy to ward these wards of the nation, (thej cannot be regarded ia any other light than wards), with fair results so far as tried, and which I hope will be at tended ultimately with great success. The Society of Friends is well known as having succeeded in living ia peace with the Indians in the early set tlement of Pennsylvania, while their white neigbors of other sects, in other sections were constantly cm broiled. They are also known for their opposition to all strife, vio lence and war, and are gen erally noted for their strict in tegrity and fair dealings, luese considerations induced me to give in of by the management of a few reserva- uons of Indians to them and throw I the burden of the selection of agents j upon the society itself. The result j has proven satisfactory. It will be ; found more fully set forth in the re-! port ot the Lommissioner of Indian ' Aflairs. 1' or superintendents and Indian agents, not on reservations, j i officers of the army vrere' selected. ! i army vrere selected. The reasons for this are numerous, and when Indian agents are sent there, or near there, troops must be sent also. The aent and com - minder of the troops are independ- j ent of each other, and are subject j to orders from different departments! of the government. The army of-j ficer holds a position for life. The I agent is one at the will of the rres - ident. The former is personally interested in living in harmony with the Indians, and in the establish- ment of a permanent peace to the end, that some portion of Ins life may be spent within the limits of a civilized section. The latter has no such personal interest. Another reason is an economic one, and still another hold which the government ha3 upon a me omcer to secure a faithful discharge of duties in car rying out a given policy. The building of railroads and the access thereby given to all agricultural and mineral regions of the country is rapidly bringing civilized settle ments into contact with all tribes of Indians. No matter what ought to be the relations between such settlements and the aboriginies, the fact is that they do not harmonize well, and one or the other has to give way in tne end. A system which looks to the extermination of race is too horrible for a nation to adopt without entailing upon it self the wrath of all Christendom, and engendering in the citizens a disregard for human life and the rights of others. Being dangerous society, I see no substitute for Euch a system except in placing all the Indians on large reservations as rapidly a3 can be done, and giving them absolute protection there. As soon as they are Jitted for it they should be induced to take their land3 in severally, and to set np territorial governments for their own protection. For full details on this subject, I call your special at tention to the reports of the Secre tary of the Interior and the Com missioner of Indian Afiairs. ' J i j ! . j ! j i J THE WAR
