MONROE, LA., DECEMIBER 7,1872. 0. W. MoaROANKI. Editor. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. WAlrHZNGToN, Dec. 2.-The Presi dent's message was at 1:40p. m. receiv .el and read. It commences with a rec ognition of the blessings which the Amerclean people have enjoyed within the past year. The only' exception b ing the great fire In Boston. It refers to the Geneva arbitration and its satis factorylresults, which left the Govern ments, American and English, without a shadow on their friendly relations, which it sincerely hoped may forever remain equally unclouded. It recom mends the immediate creation of a Board of Commissioners to decide on the amounts to be paid to individuals. It compliments Mr. Adams and Mr. Bancroft for their eminent services in the matter of the Geneva and San Juan arbitrations. The decision in thelatter leaving the United States" for the first time without any question as to dis puted boundaries. In regard to the fisheries and to our relations with the British North American provinces, the President says that lie has received notice that the Imperial Parliament and the Dominican Government have passed laws to carry the provisions of the treaty of Washington into opera tion, and he therefore recommends the legislation of Congress in the sanme di rection. He speaks of the friendly ro lations of the United States with all the governments of Europe. IIe refers to the Vienna International Exposi -tlon, and recommends the fitting up of two national vessels to convey the goods of exhibitors to Trieste, and sug gests that a proposition be lmade to have the next great exposition in this country in 1876, at the time of the Con tennial Celebration in Philadelphia. He refers to the disturbed condition of Caba, and says that no advance to wards pacification in that Island has been made, while the insurrection'had gained no advantages and exhibited no more of the elements of power or pros pective success than a year ago. Neith er had Spain succeeded in repressing the Insurrection. The parties to the strife were standing the same as for a along time past. The continuation of slavery in that Island lihe regards as among the strongest causes of the con tinuance of strife, and he thinks that the abolition of slavery anil the insti tution of other reforms could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It was greatly to be hoped that the present liberal government offpain will voluntarily adopt that view. Referring to our relations with Chi na and Japan, the President recom mends provisions for maintaining four American youths in such of thosecoun tfies as part of tile diplomatic llhnily of Ministers. He gives details of the revenue re ceived in the past year, and of the re duction to the amount of'over one hun dred million dollars of the public debt. He expresses a doubt whether any other reduction in taxation is practica ble for the present, and le recommends that no more legislation be had on that subject except to correct such erriors of omission and commission inl the pres eant laws, until sullicient time shall have elapsed to prove that it t..: eo done and still leave suoficient revoej ' to meet current expenses, pay the in terest on the public debl,t, and provide for the sinking fund, atnd suggests also that the currency shall be, as soon as possible, brought to a par with gold. IHe says that various enterprises will bei brought to the attention of Congrtnss for the cheapening of transportations of produce from the west to the Atluitic· coast, and suggests that steps, slhoulld Ib taken to gain all available information to insure equitable and judicious: legis-' lation in this connec"tionl. I It* rifrs favorably to the proposed route t, con nect the Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charleston and S.t\'ainnI, by way of the Ohio :and Tc'tenl.use rivers; also to the proposed extension of the Kanawha and Ja:nls ltiv,r ('a nal and the Che.peake and (hio Ca nal, and to the proposed t':in:l triarouil. Niagara Falls. lie says thall:t there should be an almost continucouts sy.tcet of land-locked navigation front MaLine to the Gulf of Mexico, n:luroi having provided a greater part of the route, and the obstacles to be overcome being within theskill of engireers.l ie call0s attention to the wveaknless of the Amiter ican navy anld eindorses the ret'coniluueiLI dations of the Seerir.ary of the Navy in that respect. 1i ...1.':n: l-s nul-:ili( nt for steamship lint, to lhrar-il, an, bi tween San Francisco, New Z'a-il-t i and Australia; also on the inc'rea~se the salaries of the Ilelts of bLureit:'.. He favors tihe abolition oif tlil franllkil privilege iandt reconllunltnls a Ioltditt. tion of its existing c\vil. Le :dlo re commends thle :dititionti " -onlly t'-rs· of the best nllihodtl of :ujolirinll' ti ti- t tie of all telegraphll lii,'.S now, iti ope'r ation, and of conltictinl tha:t ser\i'tct' with the post:l Sl'rvi..

I peace will induce an abatnl!onniiwnt ,f I all such comblnation· , anid wil it I will be unnrccerssnyr to calrr,- ioLtt.l- t tionS or Inflict punlshl!cnto ill otrler to I protect citizens from the lawless doings of such combination. Hle makes sug gestions in regard to the Indians that they should all be confined to the ter ritory south of Kansas, and that farms be secured to them in fee and severally. He recommends a further census be taken in 1875, but that no reappoint ment of members of Congress be made under it in only one of the territories. Utah is in the.econdition of affairs regarded by thi President as unsatisfac tory. It had seemed to be the policy of the Utah Legislature to evade all responsibility to the United States Govern ment, and even to hold a posi tion hostile to it. He recommends a careful revision of the present laws, and tle enactment of Jlaws that will secure peace and the equality of citizens there before the law, and thd ultimate extinguishment of polygamy. lie recommends an appropriation to reimburse the city of Washington for work done in front of the public reser vations, and for the embellishment of the public buildings and grounds. Ile favors the action to give greater eclat and success to the observance of the conteunial atnivcr.3ary of American independence. In regard to Civil Service he says he will carry out the rules during his term of ollice, but suggests that there be direct action of Congress to make the system binding on his successors, so as to require for the public service a practical method of obtaining faith ful and eflicient oflicers and employ The reading of thle mcrnsagc was conpleted at 2:50 o'clock, having occu pied one hour and ten minutes. THE 

ALAIIAAI ANARlCItiSTS. The New York IlHrald says: The unfortunate character of the re construction policy applied tothe South by the Rlepublican majority in Congress is maniftisted in the political disturban ces which have followed the elections in Louisiana, Alabama and other cx rebel States. Under our system of gov emrinent it has b.'en our boast, justified by the experience of nearly a century, that our constantly recurring popular elections serve us a safety-valve to po litical excitement, and that with the result of the appeal to the people all our troubles terminiate. Thei defeated party, however :strong, generally ac cepts the verdict of thle najority, and goes peacelully to work to repair its ill fortune. In tihe States we have named the election has only 1been a farce, and t disgraceful conflicit hIas arisen between the rival parlties in dcliance of the pop ular will. In seine inst:lnces serious consllequences are said to be threatened. The politicians elsewhere take sides in accordance with their aitilimations, and help to aggravate the evil insteald of endeavoring to relnive' it. The spec tacile is ono11 disl(gracful to the nation, :ant it illustrates the disordered condi tion of the country, anti the pressing necessity of a clhanllie in ouar Southern pol icy. In Alabanma, two Legislatures are in ses::sion.

They will not long suffer contending factions and ambitious politicians to plunge them into anarchy and to destroy their business and property. When Presi dent Grant makes it evident that lie is resolved to trust the Southern States as they have trusted him, and to leave them as free from Federal interference and special laws as are the other States of the Union, we shall soon have an end of the present disgraceful scenes, and the verdict of the people at the polls will be accepted at the South as peacefully as at the North. It is only to be hoped that the President will be backed up by Congress in his new Southern policy. Nothing is more certain than that the past efforts at re construction have been a failure. For this Republicans and Liberals,who are now in the opposition, are equally re sponsible, and hence they should unite in repairing the mischief themy have jointly done. AN 

IRON ISLAND. Tihe London Daily Telegraph lhao tilhe following of the new war-ship, DI)vas tation: That the Dovastation is a st:ccess, so far as she has been tried, is now admit ted. The ponderous monster, which squats upon the astonished waters with a dead weight of 10,000 tons, takes any ordinary waves with stolid indifflerence, whether she receives thenm end-on or upon bow, beam or quarter. The pro digious hill of foam which her stem piles up when under weigh, washes, as was expected, clean over her forward deck, and she is often submerged aft; i but her massive mid -section rides, quietly enough, and those on board her when anchored in the rolling tide-way at Spithead say that she wats "steadier than the houses ashore." She turns with great readiness, and itn a small circle, and her speed, as proved in six trials along the measured mile, is not only equal to the promise of her de signers, but it exceeds expectation. The mighty engines driving this island of iron with an indicated power of G,Gl00 horses, with seventy-seven revolutions to the minute, got fifteen knots and a half out of the ship, and her mean rate at full steam is thirteen knots and three quarters. Here, therefore, is a craft vulnerable only to a very Sew guns, has the swiftness of a mail packet, and the handiness-thanks to her twin screws -of a tug, while she could utitlze these qualities to hurl upon the saitls of an opponent the awful force of all her 10,000 tons moving with the velocity of a spear. On board this remarkable man-of-war there are no less thian thir ty-four distinct and separate engines, and, indeed the value which she rep resents is as serious as her flghting ca pacity. What remains to he learned is tile behavior of tle ugly giant in a real lBiscay gale; and whether or no tihe coll-de-sac which she carries aft will or will not prove a mistake in a heavy following sea. With stability assured to 55', with no top-gear to set her over, and with decks which can be lmermeti cally sealed, she would be satf enough; but whenever she (does roll, or pitch, or send, the rivets and fittings in her huge . body will be shrewdly tried. Except the Rlussian monitor, Peter the (rent, Snothing floating could resist or even " challenge such it ve'ssel, at one, so Sstrong and -swift. The torpedo, no doubt, may yet b. so developed asj to r make the Devastation and all her t em i rible sisters impotent against a dlefencd Sed coast. On the high sells at present rshei hias no superior, though we suppollls ithe day will come when even this 'amnzing construction will he us iobso lete as the three-deckers of Ne'lsen.
