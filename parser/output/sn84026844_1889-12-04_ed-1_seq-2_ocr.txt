WKuruwt peace with the Begum of Boojoo and chu rest of them, uud we are thaukful^ National aid to education, says the President; ami those who don't like it* 04ii tuke the lens of it. Tub Presideut fuigot to say that West Virginia is booming. Is it too late to Utiud hack to the printer for correctiop? Hbsi'kctbd AuarcUi&ts, read what the President says and resolve to behave yourselves or get out and blow up with s Jiue other country, It was unkind of Governor Wilson to dub Judge Jackson "Twe," These things stick to men, and are not handy to have hi the House. It Is solid Civil Service reform, not the begun article, that wius the Presi dent'* praise. Uoad what he says, pro fessional reformers, and go to. IIkvision of the tariif, (eduction of tht surplus, all without reducing the meas ure of protection given to uny iudiibtry, This is the pure milk of the word. Tub new Congressman firmly settled in his seat uud clinched on the othei Bide, can't understand how the other fel low feela cooling his heels iu the ante chamber. Tub President is solid ou the pensiot question. No deserving veteran in tin almshouse, is a good'cry. Tho count!] is not bo coldly meau that it will closi its ears und its heart to that appeal. Tub Message cuutuins 15,020 words almirably handled by the Westeri Union Telegraph Company. It requirei sane approach to perfection to do tlm along with the ordinary business of thi day. If you want to kuow what tho Presi dont thinks, read his Message. Then are no concealments, no mental reserva lions, lie hits straight out from tin shoulder. That's the kiud of u mat your Uucle Ben is. lr ]'resident Harrison has his way, ou: flag will ouce more wave over a uier chant marine, to tho protlt of tho coun try iu peace and for its protection in war Other nations foster their shipping, ant ours is not too old to learn. CAsr your eye over Wheeling and see whether the old town is not going ahead There is no margin fpr wild adventure, but there is the solidity to make salt investments. Wheeling has bueu very slow iu her day, but she always iiaf bueu sure. Wbut Virginia elected three Repub lican Congressmen, and nut onu ol ilium it ullowed lo takoJiiH scat. This is tie viay tho Democratic boasca run tiling in West Virginia. If it Lad been kuuwn tiiat tiio Republicans would haveu sure majority without Vest Virginia, tiio mischief might uot have beeu concocted. _ Tim tuiuurity report (roui tboGuber * natorlul contest co&iuilltco will bo tcady ut any time It may bo wantod, and prub ably soouer. 'l'bo majority nood not further delay because ol it. And when will the majority report bo ready? Or are there to be no many majority reports tbat it will take anutbci year to bring thorn la out of the cold ? National supervision of National ?lections, Is tho doctrine of the Mesjagc. 6o.it ought to be. Tho National Gov ernment is uot an alien. If tho people of auy State mean no wrong they will ? not object to Uncle Sam being tlioro to J jirotoct tho rights of all the pooplo. The suppression of votes in Muuisalppi touches us closely In Wost Virginia. Tim AlraMiye, Ho far as tho President's Message Is u reluniu ol eveula it can contain nothing now to tho country. So far us it relates to the l'resldent'aoplnlons ol events, his view of auy peudiug question, and Ills recomuienilatlono to Congress, it stands vastly lint of the public utterances of tho day. Though addressed to Congress, and Intended for the enlightenment of that body, it is nono tho liss the com munication of tho head ol tho greatest ol governments to the most remarkable o( peoples. Much that It is tho duty of tho President to present formally to Congress has already boon given In tho newspapers and need not be given again In tho published message. So jnuch as lias real lifo In It every body oilft.ht to read, This tho Ixmu oascwi picaenta to day, not a lino more than should bo read by every one who desires to know (i>o President's uiln 1 on the most Importune questions of the time. President Harrison dodges no public question. No topje Is omitted which he might reasonably be expected to treat. Ho discusses .each question caluily, without passion but with Intense earuestness whurfe the question ilp|teals to hlui as a man and a cltlsun. Tim .Message might have been delivered from the bench ol the Supreme Court, so judicial Is Its tone. Its eloquent appeals for lair play might have cowo from the most dlgulllcd uf orators. , It is n communication that will lro- I pteis tho mind and Isy hold ol the heart. Tliu country csnnot fall to ap preciate and commend the entire frank ness with which tha I'ressldsnt lakes all the people Into Ills coulldenco. Tho Mwssiie will set tho country to thinking rndro seriously on some questions which demand Its most n-rloim thought.

Why Hill tiut Mail WUU CUvwiaml. A'iw Yurk Cotrufxjndeut l'hUadtlvhii JVim. I waa told to-day by a gentleman iu u position to speak the truth, that the be giuumgof the antagonism between Gov eruor Hall and Mr. CleveiamL-so far as the Governor waa concerned, had its origin in u circumstance very uiuch like thut which caused the antagonism be tween Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Hewitt. ;\h my informant learned it, Governor Hill waa iutereatfd to the extent of $5, 000 in cartaiu mining or other property somewhere in the remote Went for whicn lrgialatiou waa needed at the hands of Cougrc*8. A bill was introduced and missed for a perfectly legitimate object, it ia paid, tt.o mdirect result of which would have beeu an appreciation of Mr. Hilt's intern*', so that he would have Men worth $75,000 at Ifaat. After the hill was panned, information of this effect of it waa conveyed to Mr. Cleveland and lis at once vetoed the bill. Governor tiill heard of this circumstance and the lioe waa at once drawn betweeu theui. The action of Mr. Cleveland indicated, however, thut he had already himself drawn it. _ Tiai Principle of Cincinnati Commercial* Tito contention of the ailvermen has always beeu that both metals must be in ihe standard, and that the actual meas urement of value should be found be* tweun the two rather than in either ex clusively.
