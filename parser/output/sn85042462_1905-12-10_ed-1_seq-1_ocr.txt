EXCLUSION ACT WILL STAND Members of Congress Say There Will Be No Modification By Associated Press. CHICAGO, Dec. O.— A dispatch to the Tribune from Washington says: Con gress will not enact any legislation modifying the Chinese exclusion uct. As a result tho boycott of American goods will bo reimposed shortly and there will be a greater development of the anti-foreign feeling throughout China..-. :;■■. : The prediction ys to tho attitude of congress waa nuide yesterday by lead ers of both house and senate. Tho policy of the Chinese people Is based entirely upon this attitude. In edicts issued by the Chinese emperor tho peoplo were urged to refrain from boycotting American goods pending action by congress. The viceroys of various provinces piocldlmed President Roosevelt had given assurances that congress would pass remedlary measures and that the Chinese should contluo to purchase all goods as heretofore until the purposes of the legislative branch of the Ameri can government developed. It is understood the Chinese legation lure has been making Inquiries an to the prospect of action by congress, and is satisfied there Is no chance what ever of the enactment of a satisfactory legislation. A deadlock has occurred in the treaty negotiations between Minister Rock hlll and Na Tung of the Chinese for eign office as a result of the refusal of the former to nllow the admission of : Chinese laborers into r the! American I possessions in the Pacific. ■ ■:• In exchange for -this privilege Nn. 'Tung was willing to define the classes of Chinese which should he granted entrance Into -the United States, thus authorizing the government to exclude everyone who failed to como directly within those classes. With congress unyielding and treaty negotiations Im [posslble of. successful conduct, the president is confronted by tho proba bility, of a serious blow to American commerce in the Orient. During the last year increase of export was chief ly to China, Japan and four other countries, amounting In the case of the first named empire to $41,000,000. <>C this sum $23,500,000 wrts in cotton cloth. $10,000,000 In copper and J3,G00,000 in mineral oils.
