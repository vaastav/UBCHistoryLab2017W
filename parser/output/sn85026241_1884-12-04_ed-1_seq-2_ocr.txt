It is a subject of geuferal congratulation that aXU-r tbe coniro-rr st at tbe polls was over, and while tbe alight preponderance by which that issue had been determined were, as yet unas certained, the public peace suffered no disturbance, but the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result Nothinr could more strikingly wusiraie tbe temper of tbe American- citizen; bis love of order and bia loyalty to 'law; nothing eou W moresienaliv demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political institutions.'-tight years have pmisea since a controversy eoncerning the result of a National election sharply called the attention Of the Congress to- the necessi ty or providing more precise and oeBaile regulations for tbe counting of theefceo toral vote.

THE NATIONAL FINANCES. Tbe condition of our finance and the operations of the various branches ol the public service which are connected ith tbe Treasury department are very fully discussed in tbe report of tbe Sec retary. It-appears that the. ordinary revenues for the fiscal year ended June i0, 1S&4, were: From customs, 19d,007.- 489.76; from interval revenue, 8121,586,- 0721? from all other sources, $31,858,- 3073. i Total ordinary revenues, 5348, '516,869 82. ' -' - - - - - Jhe public expenditures during the same period were: For civil expenses. $22,312,907.71; for fore'gn intercourse. $1,260,706.37; for Indians. $6,475,999.29;. for pensions, $53,429,228.36; for the mi iutry establishment, including river and harbor improvements and arsenals, $39. 429,60356; for the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery and ira pruvemenla at tbe navy yard, $17.292,.i 001.44; lor miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light houses. Had collecting therevenue.$43,939.710.U0 ; f -r expenditures on ac-onnt of the Disq uiet of Columbia. $:i,407.099.62 ; for iu teresl on tbe public debt. $34,578,378.48; for sinking fund, $46.790,229.50.. .Total ordinary expenditures, $290. 1 96,483.88. leaving a surplus of $57,603,396.09. As comparedwilb the preceding fiscal year there was a net decrease of over $21, uOo.uoo m the amount of expenditures. Tbe aggregate receipts were less than thoae of I lie year previous by about $54, (100,000. The .falling of revenue Iron! uktMns made 'up nearly $20,000,000 of this deficiency, aud -tout $23,000,000 ol hie remainder was due to the diminished leceipis from iueniil taxation. - "The Secretary estimates the total re ceipts for the fiscal year, which will eua June 30. 1885. at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures at $290,620,210 16, il. which sum an-iueiuded the interest on l be debt and Hie amount puyahle le Ui sinking fund.--This would make a sur plus for the entire year of about $39, 000,000. r . The value of exports from tbe Uniteu States to -foreign countries for the year eudinx June 30. 1S84, was as follows: Domestic merchandize, $724,964,852 ; for eign,: $li.548.7i7. Total merchandize. S7 40.5 13.609. Specie. $67,133,383. Total ex puts of merchandize and specie, $807,- 646,992. Tbe cotton aod cotton manufactures included in this statement were valuei at $208,900,415; the breadstuff's at $162. 544,715: tbe provisions at $114,416,547 and tbe mineral oils at $47,103,243. Dur ing the same period the imports were a follows: Merchandize, $667,697,693 ; gold and silver. $37,426,262; total, $705,123. 955. More than 63 per cent, of the en tire value of imported merchandize con sisted of the following articles: bugai and molasses, $103,884,274: wool and woolen manufactures, $53,542,292; silk and its manufactures, $49,u49,128; coffei $49,686,705; iron and steel and manufac tures thereof, $41,464,590; chemicals. $38,464,965; flax, hemp, jute or like sub stances end manufactures thereof. $33,- 463.398: cotton and manufactures ot cotton. $30,454,476; bides and skins othet than fur skins, $22,350,906. SILVER COINAGE. I concur with the Secretary tbe Treasury in lecommending the immedi at 6 suspension of the coinage of silver dollars and of the issuance of silver cer tificates. This is a matter to which in former communications I have mort- tban once invoked the attention of the National legislature. It appears that annually for tbe past six years there have been coined in complisuce with tbe act of February 23. 1878, more than twentv-seven million silver dollars. Th number now outstanding is reported b the Secretary to be nearly $185,000,000. whereof but little more than $40,000,000 or less than i2 per cent, are in actual circulation. Tbe mere existence of this fact seems to me to furnish of. itself a cogent argument for tbe repeal of the statute which has made such a fact pos sible.!' JJut there are other and graver considerations that tend in the same ci rection. The Secretary avows bis con' victioa that unless this coinage and the issuance of silver certificates be sub peuded silver is likely at no distant day to become out sole metallic standard The commercial disturbance aud the impairment ot the National credit that would be thus occasioned can scarcely be overestimated hope that tbe Secretary's suggestions respecting the withdrawal of circulation of the one dollar and two dollar notes, wi'l receive your approval. It is likely thai a considerable portion of ihe silver now encumbering the vaults of tbe Treasury might thus find its way into tbe currency. . ABOLITION OF EXCISE TAXES. Iu my annual message of 1882, 1 rec ommended the abolition of all excise i axes except those leiating to distilled sun its. This recommendation is now renewed. In rase these taxes shall be abolished the revenue that will still re main to the Government will, in my opinion, not onlv suffice to meet its reus sonable expenditures, but will afford surplus large enough to prrmit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advi sable, when the results of tecent revenue laws and commercial treaties shall have shown in what quarters these reductions can be most judiciously effected. One of the gravest of tbe problems which ap peals to the wisdom of Congress for so lution is the ascertainment of the most effective means of increasing our fore.gn trade and thus relieving tbe depression under which our mdustiiesare now lau guishing. The Secretary of the Treasury advises that the duty of investigating this subject he intrusted in the urst in stance to a competent comruissinn. While fully recognizing the consilera tions that may be urged agan.s. this course, I a in nevertheless of the opinion that upon the whole no other would be likely to effeet speedier or bettir results. REDEMPTION OF BONDS. . Tbe 3 par cent- bonds of Government. to the amount of more than $100,000,000, have since toy last annual message been redeemed by tbe Treasury. Tbe bonds of that issne still outstanding amount to little over 200.uou.uuu, about one fourth of which will be retired through the operations of the sinking fund the coming year. As these bonds Mill cor, s tit ute tbe chief basis of the National banks, the question bow to avert the contraction of the currency, caused by their- retirement, is one of constant y increasing importance. It s ems to be generally conceded that the law govern ing this matter exacts from the banks excessive security, and that upon their present bond deposits a larger circula tion than is nowallowtd may be print ed wi'h safety. I hope the bill that paused the Senate last session ....i. I ting tbe Issue of notes equal to the face I value of deposited bonds will commend itself to the approval of tbe House of Kepresetitativ-es. 

EXTENSION OF FOREIGN TRADE. In the course of this communicaUon reference nas more than once been made to the policy of tbe Government as re gards tbe extension of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare fie general pnnciples that should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this dW rection. Tbe main conditions of tbe .virtu luai . -v, w. i,- -1 , cMi ...wn.vw,., pecple in uvibanical pursuits and ferule Sr4-.-..,s.. JL - ..i Ill lU W svr V. a sauw vivu of territory, rich in agricultural products and iu nearly all tbe raw materials ue oetsary for successful manufacture. We have a system of productive establish ment more than sufficient to supply our own tdeinanus the wages of labor noH where else so great, the scale of living of our artisan classes is such as tends to sqcure; .their persoual comfort and the developmeut of those higher morals aad'.intelleotualaculties that go to tbe making ot good citizens, our system ot las. aqd tariff legislation is yielding a revenue which is in excess of tbe present needs of the government; tbese are ele ments lTom which it is sought to devise a scheme by which without unfavorably changing the condition of tbe working men. our nisrebant marine shall be re lieved from its enfeebled conaition and new Markets provided for sale beyond our border., of J he manifold fruits of our industrial enterprises. Tbe problem is complex and can be solved by no single, measure o& innovation or reform. The couuiries of tbe American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United States the natnral marts of supply and demand; It is from them we should ob tain what we do-not produce, or do not produce to sufficiency1, and it Is to them the surplus productions of our tields.our uilia and our workshops should flow under , condition that will equalize or favor Uieao. in comparison with foreign compeiilioBii Four paths of policy seem to point to'thw end.-'. Jr. - . First A serf) of reciprocal commer cial treaties wilhthe countries of Amer ica, which shall foster" between us and them an unhampered movement of trade, and the condition of these treaties should 1 tbe free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce In return for admission free or under fafored scheme of duties of our own products, the benefits of such ex change to apply only to goods under tbe dag of the parties to tbe- contract, tbe removal on both sides from the vessels io privileged, of all tonnage duties and imports, so -that -their vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and tbose of the other contracting parties, though without infringing on tbe reserved borne ouaeling trade, tbe removal or reduction f burdens on Che ex port td product of those ceuntriee coming within the bene fits of the treaties,- and the avoidance of the technical restricliops and penalties by which our intercourse with tbose countries is at present hampered. Secondly The establishment of tbe consular service of tbe United States on a salaried - footing, thus permitting the reliuquisbmept of consular fees, not only as respects vessels under the Na lional dag. but also as respects vessels of tbe treaty nations carrying goo Is en titled to tbe benefits oi the treaties. Thirdly t he enactment ot measures to favor tbe ' construction and mainte naoce of a steam carrying marine under tbe flag of the United States.
