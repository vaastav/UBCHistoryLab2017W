"I knew that the 30-inch sewer in the First ward was not properly built, and to satisfy my mind I crawled through It from .Magnolia to Xapa, thence to Sprague street, and from there to Crestline. I found the bottom of the sewer run ning up and down like an ocean wave or a camel's back, and this accounts for the congestion of refuse from the Stanton packing house in the sewer rlast summer and the terrible odor exuding there from, as exposed in The Press. "The condition of the sewer bed was called to the attention of the First Ward Improvement club, and since then I have been a marked man. with the staff of the engi neer's office. "The first dose they handed me was on the acceptance of the Atlan tic street alley sewer, in which 1 was forced to go 1 4-10 feet deeper without extra compensation on the claim that my men had changed the stakes. It was clearly the error of the engineer's office, but we were made lo pocket the loss. "On the Eighth avenue sewer. Mr. Maloney first placed me in charge, but learned that on my ac count the- engineers would not give the points.
