It was the open ing of the door, as it were, to good health and energy of brain and body.

ENLARGES POWERS OF THE COMMISSION Kevea Members, Servlas; Sevea Years, at "alary of 10,O4NI, way Pass I ps)romp1al4a I ai der tho .Art. WASHINGTON. Deo. . The Esch-Town-send railroad bill, which passed the house tit its lust session,' has been redrawn and was Introduced In the house today by Mr. Townsend. The bill -embraces all of the features of. the .oftrfer measure, but is drawn so a td jtecify the things which may be done by the Interstate Commerce commission. In addition It has a publicity feature and the bill gives the commission jurisdiction over refrigeration and terminal charges. It, also directly prohlbts the car rier from, granting any shlppr the priv ilege pf collecting . his product and then getting a special rate under the short-term provision for changing rates. As explained today y Mr. Townsend, the bill "expresses IM ideas Of the president In hls'tnessnge and will, If enacted Into law,, amend the Interstate commerce law so as to make it rnore effectual tn. securing exact JuBtlcj between 4he carriers, ship pers, producers and bo'nsumers. It amends the substantlva law so as to embrace within- the '; powers 4 of the commission" all Interstate carriers of Interstate and foreign commerce,, whether by. railroads or partly by railroads and ; partly'' by water, and In cludes specifically In the term transporta tion all crs, vehicles, -ventilation, refrig eration, elevation, transfer, storage and all other' fttcilUies, and instrumentalities of shipment ad carriage, as well as terminal, siding and industrial (racks, thus giving the commission authority over the so-called private car and .other agencies, . .Enlarges ttte' Commlaaloa. ; ' ,. "It enlarge the . interstate Commerce commission t , seven . members, increases the length, of tlttiin tefm of office to seven years and tl eSrlo to $10,000. This la done at the, president's aUggestlon, as the Increased. powerf conferred upoo. the com mission will 'Increase Us duties , and ..re sponsibilities and require, th best nwn ob tainable.' Thlij commission, will compel the establishment "of Joint through -rate for interstate traffic and abolish the cus tom which exists in some cases of bill ing shipments within the borders of a stata and tnen compel a reBhlpment. "It seeks' to abolish the so-called midnight rate evil by enlarging the time in which a purpose or scheduled rate can be changed to sixty days, .and compels the carrier, to itemise Its schedules and . rates in ac cordance with, thelnst ructions of the coith mission. . This schedule must also show the division of fares or charges between so called trunk or through lines and terminal or Industrial roads. "The bill also provides that the commis sion shall decide promptly and within ninety days after hearing all cases brought before It. .It contains practically the same provision of the Each-Townsend bill, which authorises the commission, upon complaint and. after full hearing, to determine whether a rata, orv regulation is reasonable or unreasonable, and if unreasonable, to substlttue the reasonable maximum rate In its stead, and it may. order both a maxl- mum and minimum rate in cases involving the relation t f rates when It finds that course -necessary- to enforce the ap pllcatlpri MfcC itfatentlat' . charges, and such ord;fW,5lJia'o)nmlssioh shall go Into effect sjilthln thirty days after which it la mad. ' Provides for Conrt Proceeding's. This same provision Applies also to Joint rates and where the 'carrier parties to such Joint rates fail to agree on the di vision of the same, the commission may determine the share of each carrier. "It also- provides for a rehearing upon any order which- the commission has made on the application of each party to tha case. In chse the carrier Is dissatisfied it can on petition begin proceedings In the federal courts of the Judicial district In which it has its principal operating office, alleging that the order of the commis sion Is unlawful and praying that it be vacated and set aside. When such petition is filed it is the duty of the attorney gen eral to give notice, as provided under the expedition act of February 11. 1904, where upon the court, consisting of three circuit Judges, or two circuit Judges, and a dis trict Judgo, shall proceed directly to de termine the lawfulness of the commis sion's order, in which case the commis sioner is the defendant and the attorney general has charge of the defense. Either party to the proceeding may appeal from the decision of the expedition court di rectly to the supreme court. No provision Is made for suspending either th order of the commission or of the trial court,, for the reason that the court, whether ex pressly permitted by the bill or not would have the power to enjoin any order if the proper . showing is made that the order or decree la unlawful., ....... , Inspection and Reports. "The bill flso provides that the com mission' shall have authority to designate and employ speciaK Agents and examiners, empowered to administer oaths, examine witnesses and receive evidence; this Is done to expedite business before the commis sion. "The bill also provides for the fullest poHKlble reports from the railroads of every detail of their business and business relations showing receipts and disburse ments, all contracts, private or otherwise, and gives the commission power to re quire specified methods of keeping ac counts and of making reports. The bill also authorizes the commission and its agents to inspect at any time all books of accounts, records, memoranda or contracts, and Imposes fines and imprisonment tor keeping and. reporting anything but-true and full records and for withholding any information from the commission. "The president in his message calls par ticular attention to tfiree matters which should be included in any measure to amend the Interstate commerce law: First, to provide against co-called midnight rates; second, to empower the commission with authority to tlx. upon complaint and full hearing, a reasonable maximum rate In place of one found by the commission to be unreasonable, and to have ft go into early effect; . third, to compel the widest publicity of railroad bookkeeping and methods. , This, the new Esch-Townsend bill fully accomplishes."

SOLDIER MAY BE FATALLY HURT Foand Wandering; In , Seml-ronseloua Condition with Hend Badly Battered. Sergeant Rogers, Company M of the Thir tieth infantry, stationed at Fort Crook, vas found stumbling aimlessly along Capitol avenue last night at 8 o'clock. He wax In a J semi-conscious condition from the effects of many wounds and bruised on his head and face. He was taken into the rooms at 920 Capitol avenue, whero the police surgeons attended, bis Injuries. , There- were 'no less than six scalp wounds, 'that had the appear ance of having been Inflicted by the toe of a heavy boot ox shoe. The soldiers, of whom there were quite a number In town, said the sergeant had last been seen' by them In Burk's saloon at Tenth and Davenport and that he wae then In the company of a pri vate by the name of Frank Bowers. They said that Rogers had drawn $83 on the last pay day. In his semi-conscious state little could be learned from him as to how or where he had been assaulted. In a lucid moment he Lsaid he had $12 when at the saloon. He also said a negro had assaulted him, but where this was he was unable to tell. His friends from the fort think he was assaulted either In the saloon or In the dark street as he was leaving, there. He was not found, however, until the blood had had time to dfy in his face. His money was ail gone. Frank Bowers was arrested on Harney street near Fourteenth at 9:30. He was charged with drunkenness and was unable to tell any thing about Rogers'. Injuries. At 10:30 Rogers was reported worse. He was taken to the police station, where it was .discovered that he was suffering from a fracture of the cheek bone. After his In juries had been attended to again a bed was prepared in one of the cells to accom modate him. It was not thought that rob- bery was the canse of the assault, though It is probable that some money was taken from Rogers during or after the time he re ceived his wounds.
