While the victorious 'march of popular government is deemed certain; and most thinkers admit that its course cannot be stayed, but it will soon take triumphant possession of all thrones in all lands, the fact is not received by all with equal ap provaL There are those who watch the advancing tide with'dislike and 'distrust; they look upon it as an impure and head long torrent that will sweep 'away mosfif not all the world has heretofore held ousred and venerable in manners and and leave only min andAevastatfon In its track. Some of the ablest and most earnest advocates of human '.rights and popular institutions, find much to deplore in the present results of democracy, admit that St has brought with It many evils. Prominent among these deplorable evils are its alleged destruction of all nobil ity of spirit and chivalry of feeling, and its degrading that pride of personal honor and lofty self-devotion, -so conspicuous in former". ; Hwi*a t to a mean and low scramble and'struggle for place or profit; Mr, Mill says ho is charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal'state of human beings is that of struggling to get’ on: that the trampling, crushing, elbow ing. and treading on each other's heels, which form the existing type of social-life are the most desirable lot of humnn kind; The Northern and Middle of the United States are specimens of this stage of civilization in 'very favorable stances- Having apparently gotten rid of all social injustice and inequalities, all these advantages seem* yet to hare done for them is, that the life of the whole of one sex is devoted to dollar-hnuting, «»tis of the other to multiplying the breed of dollar-hnnters. This is not a kind of so- dil perfection which the philanthropist of the fixture will feel any very eager de sire to assist in realizing. It cannot be denied that the picture thus given is, in many respects, true, though the shadows are, perhaps, a little too dark, and the lights not quite strong enough. Indeed, the evil has been grow ing for many years and to-day, the greed for money, the passion to get* rich is so strong among otir people, and its various methods of bribery and corruption have become so vast and bold, tbftt 1 they even threaten to undermine the founda tions of our free institutions. One of the most pressing problems of the hour is how to check the speed of this malignant* dis ease, which threatens to cat out all manli ness and honesty from the public heart, and leave the country a prey to the vilest kind of fraud and dishonor. A distinguished French thfnker, seeing how the Bed Bepubllcanism of Europe was exposed to the ravages of the same mean love of wealth, has laid before them some views which he hopes may moderate and control a malady so fatal Says the cele brated Benan to the French Democracy, 44 To become rich should not be the high est aim of any man. Riches may have their power, and to those ambitions of the power riches give, they may be an object of eager pursuit; but there are . other things that have a greater power, and the pursuit of which is a far higher amhtHnti Before God the poor man, who is courage ous and free from envy, the simple devout man, the obscure woman who prepares well her every day task, are superior to the rich man who dazzles the world by his opulence, and the vain ™aq who fills the world with his own name. And, strange and astonishing as it may seem to the devotee of wealth, a nobler and higher ob ject of ambition than riches is poverty." Bessys, 4, D0 cot tell the poor man that he is poor from his own fault; do not teach him to free himself from poverty as from a shame, make him love poverty; show him its nobleness, its charm, its beauty, its sweetness. This was the crowning work of Jesus; the exaltation of poverty was his master stroke. Men toil strive to become rich that they may become inde pendent : but the pretended independence of the rich man is an illusion. The' rich man, on the contrary, is the least Inde pendent of men, the least fitted for truth. He depends upon riches; bis opinions and sentiments are those which belong to his riches. A society which Say for its a mad pursuit of riches, is condemned to power!essneas and mediocrity.” This distinguished writer says nlao, and it would be well to give heed to his warn ing : 44 Blind are those who think the men who hold the power in their hwmin an omnipotent democracy, mad in the chase for wealth, will stop before any legal priv ileges or defences behind which fortune may be intrenched, so long as fortune is, in their eyes, the great and only prize.” And from some things which have taken place in our county, it would seem that we were fast approaching this very condition, and that no rights of others, and no princi ples of law and justice, can stand long in the way, when a combination of bold and desperate men have resolved to enrich themselves by seizing the property of others. It is, we fear, but a dream, that any of our democracy will ever take upon Cbem ffclves vows of poverty, or ever devote themselves to the self-denying life of the mendicant, but it is, notwithstanding, true, that all we hold most precious is in peril from this mad and headlong pursuit of wealth. W ith the present mania for get ting rich, ohr boasted free institutions them selves seem to be rapidly changing into simply improved devices for enrichingthose wbo know how to use them for making money; and oar noble democracy only the fatert method for rendering rascality hon orable, and furnishing with dignity and power the biggest end most desperate job bers and gamblers. OUR LAD? 

LECTURERS. Some of our exchanges, including the Cincinnati Commercial, Gazette, and St. Lonis Democrat have broken forth in a fervor of indignation over the alleged flap doodle and moonshine served up by our lady lecturers. We are told by these severe critics that when the male oratori cal biped sets forth_on his pilgrimage un der an engagement to repeat a single lee tore every night for a hundred nights, learning, wit, humor, logic, novelty, force, and pathos are on their travels. But wheu our ladies of the rostrum pack up their band-boxea and their trank* fall of false hair and other feminine combinations, for a similar tour, the crowds gather, not to hear what she has to ssy* bnt t 0 hetr a saying it. like the song of the dying ’ swan, the in terest lies, not in the melody of the strain, but the creature that sings it. : We ure told that tha so unaccustomed to hear a lady “tell her mind,” straight through for an hour at n stretch, without being interrupted, that the dulcet strain charms with its sense of nov elty ; that what we admire in Anna Dick inson is not the wise saws and modem in stances, not the prophetic yearnings of the fiery soul, not the convincing historical demonstrations, but the play of her pretty little foot, darting In and out from its hiding place, like a mouse Xrom its cover, as suggests the antique and dainty Sir John Suckling We are assured, also, that much of the eloquence of Olive Logan lies in her graceful figure and tbo piquant way in which she says all that a woman should, which necessarily includes much ihal a woman should not, Alisa Edgarton, the Fearl of the Platform, is the greatest offender of aIL The fact that she is young proves sufficiently that she is not wise. Her beauty convicts her of mediocrity, for all sweet women are soft. And, finally, how dare she lecture upon so delicate a subject as marriage and divorce, and pro tend to be conservative, when everybody must perceive that, if she were really con servative, she would not lecture at all. .We Xeel enlightened by all this sublime tittle-tattle vu tbepart of our masculine. contemporaries of Cincinnati and] 81. Ixrals. if any of the female lecturers hare ever occupied their midlenoesTwith any thing more stupid than these' accusations themselves are, they would he half' proven. Did the writers once stop to inquire .who ere the mason line’lecturers from whom wo roceivo’theee periodical overdoses of pro fandity, wit, and bathop ? How many of them are thereVho, In addressing ai au dience’ of ’weß-infonhedT persona, Convey any instruction? "They recall'ftota I»nd irelhs with which 'wa aio, or 'haTC boon, familiar;' they emtmartio T and' group a sortea of faota; so as to make" them' j - “ Point a moral or adorn a tale";*' ~ ■ but this is all. ' On the’whole; the best story-teller is the best lecturer,'whether male or female; Audiences in' our rnral, and even* metropolitan; towns tom oat to lectures for social reasons mainly,~of which the lecture .is the pretext. LadieVgb to see the “ styles.” to enjoy; the pleasure of aggregation,' of seeing meh-and worn «n assemble In flocks and Herds, • where their appearances', can be observed 'and noted, In-short, to “see and be seen.'’ Men go to rest, observe, and be ammsed. Inslmclion is not, after all, half so import ant in this life as amusement. The Jfation has sunk • nearly $50,000 -in making ■ the most instructive and thoughtful journal ever "issued ..in this, country, and has at tained only 5,000. or .6,000 circulation, while Carl Pretzel issues his Leedle Fan dereTy with a grin on - every page, and lo! an edition of 10,000 is sold of the first number. The -President’s message gets fewer readers than Bret Harte’s “ Heathen Chinee.” - The same holds into in the lecture-room. If feir Isaac Newton could retnrn to earth and lecture learnedly on the law of gravita tion, or Professor Salford would explain to an audience how he calculates the size and density of Saturn, mentally, in four and a half ; seconds, we suppose, their hearers would be bored. Bnt a house can be pack ed on all occasions where a good laugh is promised, because laughing is so much more important to the health' and .destiny of mankind than mathematics, ■ The com mon practice of - mankind, or what we oall their “ horse sense,” is in this respect bet ter than the teachings of the pedagogues and 4 * scientists.” We prefer a lady leo tnrer to the male biped, therefore, because they more thoroughly .fill the place which belongs to a popular lecturer. They amuse us oH.the.wajr down. • J 4 j We distinctly aver that we want no 'wis dom, nor instruction; no statistics oh pauperism in Tartary,, or essays onj the synthesis of Genesis, at the Ups of lovely woman. We don't want to have a fleshing eye and.delicate cheek associated in our minds with ugly discussions about anthxo pomoiphitio hallucinations, or the coloniz ing period of the Aryan and Semitic races. As between ell that and a plain oyster stew. with crackers, we ahoold choose the Saddle Bocks. Our contemporaries of Cincinnati and St Louis should apply mustard to their backs. Their circulation, the little they have, runs entirely too much to the brain. 'When they have recovered their healthy judg ment, they will perceive that the qualifica tions of a lady lecturer are a sylph-like form and a soft fascinating voice, an elegant train and a graceful ease in disposing of it, a dear complexion and splendid teeth, a ravishing smile and a flashing eye. There should be vivacity, gaiety; mirth, *fancy, wit, and trenchant tit-bits of sarcasm, to show character and individuality. As the string upon which all these womanly pearls are strung, there should be, if necessary, a lecture, a reading, a declamation, a song, or a dance, it is no great matter which, so long as it is light, aerial, fantastic and amusing. jm AND JAT. We give upa large portionof to-day‘aSup plement to an article from the Westminster JUmUtr, both the length and title of which may possibly repel some of our readers. The title is so familiar that many persons doubtless think they are equally familiar with the subject, while others, perhaps, who have turned away from It before, will turn away from it now, persuaded fh»f t as they never yet have mastered the subject of the railroad ring of New York, they never can. Nevertheless, we venture to republish the article, long as it is, and venture further to commend it as most entnrtaming and use ful reading, both to those who understand and those who do not understand, the ways of Jim Fisk and Jay Gould with the Erie Bead, and the great September gale in Wall street in 1869. The story could not be told in less space, and could not be told at all with anything like the clearness and cleverness of this narration, except by one who has waded through volumes of evi dence, of legal documents, and of contem porary events, to educate himselt fo the task. It is a chapter in our history as in teresting as. any that has ever, been written of the great financial bub ble of John Law, which expanded and burst a century and a half ago, and more important than that, inasmuch as the author of that scheme was himself honestly deluded quite as much as he deluded oth ers, whOe the modem financiers,! with whom this story deals, make no pretensions to honor orlioncsty, and are only distin guished from other rogues and thieves by the gigantic character of their schemes. Nor is such a history unworthy of the study of the moralist, as well as of the pol itician and the financier. Success cov ers more sins than charity. But it cer tainly is a serious question as to what the real moral condition of our society is now, and what it will be when the young men now just entering upon the affairs of the country shall come to make and control thorn, if such a creature as this Jim Fisk can be much longer, not merely tolerated, but greeted with applause and looked up to with ad miration. As a leader of fashion of a cer tain sort, as a Colonel of a regiment of a thousand young men, who are only too glad to flock around his standard, as a man generally who expects and receives far more applause for his success in accumu lating riches than condemnation for the means he uses, he is the centre of a certain degree of consideration and respect which may well bear analysis. This certainly can not be denied by one who reads the article to which we refer;—the essential character of this-m&n was just as well known two or three years ago as it Is to-day,- and, without pretending to any particular or Puritanism, we are free tos ay that no one vhomadc any pretence to be a gentle man, or had any claim to be anything above a thimble-rigger, or the lower sort of blackleg, could possibly associate with hi™ who stopped to reflect upon what manner of man he really was. Bat, as yet, so far is this notion from being the popular one, Fisk is, at this moment,' in the enjoy ment of a certain sort of popular esteem and admiration. Even President Grant, as' this narrative.'khowa, with all his natural reticence, and Ms soldierly scruples, could accept his hospitality and admit him, to a certain degree, into confidential rela tions. The phenomenon -is certainly one worthy of serious consideration, and the. deductions to be drawn therefrom, as to the moral condition of American society, might possibly be startling, "We do not mean to tell over again in brief the story of the gold conspiracy ; bat there is ane-point>whioh is pertinent to what we have said already, and which the writer in the Weitvitmter, though he seems to point at it, does not distinctly state. It will be observed by the careful reader that Fisk was hot, in the early stages of that business, in the confidence of Gould. So long as the latter expected' to reap a gigantic fortune, greater, had he succeeded, than it ever yet fell to the lot of one man to make, the chosen companion of his other ventures was left out of his councils. It was only when ruin, as gi gratis and complete as the fortune he had 1 hoped and schemed for, stared him in the face, that he called in Jim. The great day was Friday, the 24th of September; bat Fisk knew nothing of Gould's operations till after the 10th. He, Gould, had schemed to influence the policy of the President and the government; had bought Corbin; had secured Butterfield; had heaped up mill ions upon millions for a rise; but Fisk was left ont in the dark. But there came presently that stage in the affair when some new and desperate step was to be taken, not that there might be success, but that there might be escape. Gould knew hfa man, and thenceforward he and Fisk worked together, and on. the final, fatal day the policy they had resolved upon was carried out with the result they aimed at. .Fisk bought and the market was -rm . all the millions which, wUhoulJihM unpre oede&ted rise would have sunk him deeper than ever plummet Bounded, whether moral or material. He escaped niter ruin, bat where was Fist? Why did not. the' load that would, have carried down Gould carry .Aim down? His resource was ah unfailing one. * With a boldness unmatched in’any of their operations be fore, these conspirators based all their cal culations upon the fact that Fisk had. nei ther character nor reputation; that he could no more bo sunk than a rotten egg. He, therefore, repudiated all h!s contracts —slipped his neck from under the burden, and left it to fall upon the shoulders of other people. Ho doubt the rogues were breathless and frightened at the success of their bold game when. they, fled to the gor geous den at House to divide the swag which Gould carried away with him; After that, the rest ~was easy. The ingenuity of Mr. Field,* and the* legal era dition of that eminent judioial light, Jus tice Barnard, could be trusted to put ev erybody in the position of a criminal who aaked a settlement of a gold contract which Gould wasudt disposed to make. ' . Whether a living person would naturally prefer to be himself -or a dead man, is a conundrum which’ came very near being answered at the recent press banquet in this city, where one .of the speakers allowed that he would rather be Horace Greeley than to he any one of several deceased persons, among whom were particularly mentioned Julius Ctesar, Napoleon Bona parte and John Hilton.

K, ISTCk THEOHICAGO TRIBUNE. SUNDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1870 HE WORLD OF AMUSEMENT.’ Beethovon. The- Centennial Anniversary of His Birth. NUsson., i Interesting Details of Iler Sea son. i 7b the Editor of The Chicago TViburu: It seems to me that in all -my recollections of muslo in Chicago, recollections which’ run back nearly twenty years, Eheu! lempus ftigit, I can recall no such musical season as thepreseut. First/ there was that pleasant English opera season. Then followed, the superb Lefra&e, the delightful Bamabee- Smith concerts, the memorable Thnm«« orchestral season. the combination of and toilette by that musical-modiste Clara Louise Kellogg, the too brief season of Ade laide FhUUppe, last week the Beethoven Cen tennial, and this week Nilsson. : Perhaps I am an enthusiast, but it seemed to ms, as I heard the ' Ninth Symphony re hearsed on ThoradayJtaomiDg, that it was the noblest, the grandest, the most dignified and far-reaching work of art which God Almighty ever allowed man to perform. It Beamed to me to be the whole of life concentrated in one 'picture by the power of music—not the life cf a butterfly or a society “catch,” bat the life that is real and earnest, the life that is worth living, although it is pierced by fate and crowned with tboma. Goethe drew the same picture at one sitting, and Shskspeare baa portrayed it, passion by passion, in ml his plsys; but the words hamper and fetter the movement and the reality of the terrible story. Von can see it, but you do not feel, it; * for in words there Is a boundary you cannot pass, but In muslo there is inspiration and suggestion in the master band of genius, which carries you above the Fates spuming In the upper air, and raises the curtain which veils the Infinite, In that first moment occur the everlasting question ing of,and struggle with. Fate, the alternations between hope and despair, tic to® and de feat, the pretence of the gloomy shadow which always darkles between us and the un quenchable light. In the second, pleasure summons all heruymphs andsatyra,her sylphs and bacchantes, passing before us to m *a rev* elry, hut' in tbs background still follows that gloomy abide, and its wild shneke pierce through the din of the reveller aa the shriek of a piccolo pierces through the massed harmony of a full orchestra. The third movement is aa elegy, full of buried hope and yet of placid' redgnation. Man ceasee his useless struggle. Neither the philosophy of Facet nor themet aphjaics of Hamlet avail. The 0 f Pleasure is drained and there are only bitter dregs at the bottom. But in the fourth move ment the human voice speaks and dissolves the charm. Voice calls unto voice as wave answers to wave, and, finally, the great chorus of humanity bids the millions embrace, for love and peace have prevailed and universal liberty and universal brotherhood proclaim the victory of Man. And this, it seems to me, is the grandest theme which has ever yet en gaged the mind of the artist; this is the crown ing harmony of art. In listening to Mr. Collier’s admirable ora tiopon Friday evening, I could find but one statement to which exceptions might be taken, viz. s “ Mendelssohn was Hebraic.” I greatly fear that some disciple of Wagner has indoc trinated Mr. (Jollier with the Judaism iu mu sic. There is no distinctive national charac teristic in Mendelssohn’s music. He is the boundary line between the old and the new. His music Is a departure from the figured forms of the old to the dramatiii color realism of the new. Mendelssohn wrote for all the world as Beethoven did, but Mendels •obn was objective, and Beethoven subject ive. Beethoven had no such tints as mark the Midsummer Night’s Dream music, and Mendelssohn no such subjective meta physical power aa marks the Ninth Symphony. Beethoven was massive, majestic, ragged, and colossal; Mendelssohn was stately, ele gant, graceful, and beautiful, and the music of the two masters is a perfect tone-picture of their lives aa influenced by snmmnding circumstances, which, in the one case, were always friendly; in the other, always adverse. Uendelsahon was the poet of sentiment, the Jean Paul of romance; Beethoven was the poet of sentiment and intellect combined, the Goethe of all time. Mendelieohn has always seemed to me to be like a beautiful, symmetrical tree in a ear den, every limb drooping in graceful curve, its trunk perfect in taper, its foliage exquisite In greenery, its blossoms delicately tinted and loading the air with their odorous breaths. Flowers of lovely hue now all around It. The fairies bold their moonlight revela in the rich grass under its leaf canopy. The miner's boy meets bis betrothed there. The first .violet blossoms there. The birds sing in Rebranches their sweetest raring songs. Only the gentle zephyrs rnatle its leaves. The sun la never clouded, but all day weaves through its inter facing boughs a pattern of delicate light and shade.- No rude galea disturb U in this seques tered garden. Life flows on calmly ana se renely, undisturbed by a ripple. On the other band, Beethoven has always seemed to me like a mountain oak, which has endured the storms of centuries, and wrestled many a time and oft with the fierce blasts. Its top rises to the heavens, and its roots strike down deep into' the earth, anchoring themselves among the primeval rocks. It catches the suggestions of the Infinite, be cause it is near the heavens. Nature whis pers to it her mysterious secrets, because its roots are entwined about her very heart. The storms and the lightnings of years have twitted and bqnt and wrinkled it, but it has gained sturdiness and ragged strength with each new attack of the elements. Its bark is wrinkled, its limbs are jagged and knotted, like the . arms of a. gladiator, but it stands there solitary and alone, msjoatic, strong and grand, defying the winds and the UgbU nings, defying time itaelf. And yet upon this* bough and that bough, in this feaf and leaf, in vernal green and autumn gold, there is beauty, and the birds ring in its branches. It catches the first light of the gray morning, and the last gleam of tbo purple eve. We look at the tree In the garden and admire and love. We lookupon the tree as the mountain, and wonder and worship. Under the one, the furies and elvea may disport themselves: under the other, the Druids worship. Under the one Apollo basks with bis lyre; under the other Jupiter, the Cloud-Bearer, rests with hisjlgbtxunga. .. Not Hebraic alone, Sir. Collier, but, band In band, the two great nxaaters of mono go sing ing down the stream of time; and fn those twain is all music for all the ages—all music for hnmanitj, from the sorrowing heart of a woman np to the universal brotherhood of mas, and, beyond these, to (bo everlasting attributes of the Deity. And, in leaving Beethoven, it would not bo Just to deny Mr.Balatka the tribute which he c serves, for to his conscientious endeavor and to his unremitting labor is duo our enjoy ment of the Ninth Symphony. Previous to this time he had given ns the first. Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Symphonies, aninow he has crowned his la bors with tbe Ninth. And, while thanking him for my share of pleasure, I hope he will not reel contented until he has added tbe Third (the Heroic), and made the list com plete. And now we go from Beethoven to Nilsson, the fair-haired singer of Smoland. Conader ing the predictions of disaster in another journal, it Is rather amoving to see that the sale for the NiUaon season has never been equalled in this country. Unto this writing, tbe sale of season seats has amonnted to -f9,000, and of single seats to €5,000, which is pretty good for a faOnre! In fact, it seems to me that any well regulated person should be delighted to fail this way as often as'pos sible. .It is not tbe first time that Chicago has shown herself to bo the • only city in the country which can properly support legiti mate amusements. Chicago gave Bistort the beat season she over hid. Chicago gave Parepa the most golden reception .the pin guid prims-donna ever experienced. - Chicago gave to Mad. Seebach the largest house she ever knew. Chicago gave toflbeodore Thomas the most overflowing concert he ever saw. Chicago gave to EngUsh opera a season un paralleled in profit, and now Chicago once more tenders the Scandinavian rfira the most royal and lavish welcome she has ever had. All of which goes to show that Chicago knows what a good thing is,, for the reverse of this prodigality is equally true. There is not a dty In the United States which will send so few people to a really poor entertain ment. It strikes me that, without anv petsontl Imowledge of this artist’s vocal aSthties, she ia worthy the welcome we extend to her. She tae oome tip from the humble beginning of a little peasant maiden pickingnp a few coppers at the Tillage fairs of Sweden, with her voice and violin, and by dint of her talent alone has made her name known in every part of the world, as one of the recognized queens of eong. This little Scandinavian, once offered the munificent sum of six dollars per yeiar by a strolling juggler, if she would join his Jronpe, has stood before Queens' and Emperors, and the maiden of low birth baS compelled recognition from them by the power of a sceptre more commanding and more universal than theirs—the supremacy of music over the com mon heart. She triumphed even in Paris with a Fioiefla who was not a Sybarite. She made for MozarTe Ihnna &vira and .isfra jirnnmanle the first real success they ever achieved in France. She gave Marguerite with the true German sentiment and the pas sion of nature, and Paris. which at first ob jected to her Marguerite because It was not a gnsette, at last recognized it as a great work SL«*: now. having conquered the French JlioieUa (for ft ia essential ly the Dame ~ am. Camellias), the Ger man OrtfcfcTi, and the Italian FJcirc, ‘“ecrownea the whole wo* by the realization of Bhakspeare s (ghetto, her dramatic coun trywoman. and made It her master piece. And now this peasant girl, this once obscure canutrice of the Theatre Lyrique, comes to ns as the successor of Jenny lend, and be tween them are many points? of resem blance. Both are Swedes. Both are rifted with phenomenal voices. Both owe to their wonderful natural gifts their elevation from a bumble origin to the attainment of fortune and of world-wide fame. Chicago win give her such welcome as she deserves, but probably the most touching wel come of allwill come from her countrymen In th» city. They hare tendered her a reception and banquet, on Thursday evening next at the new and elegant Gorman House, now the finest ball m the city. She has accepted the same by tdegrspb, and I may now give yon the details « they have been arranged by the Committee of the SveaSociety: Mil* Nilsson will ride from her hotel to the hall in drawn by four white horses, escort ed by the Committee and her company fax car- After the introductions to her conn ♦ry people. and others, she will be presented •tth a.besutifol wreath of solid gold, with her monogram* In diamonds.

Th° Beethoven Centennial Festival closed last evening with one of the grandest concerts ever given in this city—grand in its music, and grand tn its performance; and it was specially intoest- Ing. as affording another proof with the proper care and stndy, we have the resources right here at home to produce music of the high* est order. The concert opened with the overture to “ Egmont,” which was admirably played by the orchestra. Mile. Anns Roseta followed with the Ah! ptrfiio, the grand aria from “Fidelia,” in w inch her robust voice and explosive method told with floe effect, especla’ly in the delivery of the passionately and tn tensely dramatic reci tative. Her great range of voice was also thoroughly developed, ; and the aria „ afforded the _ best opportunity wc bare yet- had ol heating her voice at tta best. The third number was toe im mortal “ Adelaide,” and It was a rare treat that it was given to Blscboff to slog it. He has done many good things heretofore, bat nothing so good as this. Indeed, few tenors, even among the pro fessionals, have ever acquitted themselves so ad mirably. Always true in tone, always neat la de livery, and with the most perfect exoressloo, he sing in a manner which fairly outdid himself. The song has not often been snog here, and hith erto llabehnsno has always sung it best, but he most now yield the palm to Bisctoff. The per formance took the audience fairly by storm, and an eneort was enthusiastically awarded him. * a The Glory of God,” with its stately qdUods, was then given by the fall choras. Mile. Rosettl followed, with the delicious and smoothly flowing ana from 44 Egmont,” (Freud voll nod teld roll) which was sang with sacb taste that she gained an m~. tort, ana replied with an bravura ana la which the displayed remarkable executive ability. This led the way to the grand feature of the evening, the Ninth Symphony. We have already published a very full and accurate analysis of the vartous movements of this great work, and need not re peat them on this ooc&alon. Tbeorchestra showed more decided stndy than they have ever evinced before. Many of the old players, among them DeClerqne, who has been absent too long, were tn their places, and with 'the new organization and new disposition of the forces, the orchestra really achieved wooden with IhhntM&catt work. Where the general perform ance was so excellent, and the spirit of determi nation so manifest, we have no disposition to And fault with, small details. The orchestra seized the work, micsbretdth sad Immensity, as they bare neverdonebefore with any worxof Beethoven’s, and every playerplayed wuo close attention to hts work, and with an honesty of effort (praiseworthy in the extreme. The Germania Msunerchor ladles and genUemen.nnmberlog about 100 voices, sustained the chorus in the last Mr. OoodwlUie taking the baritone solo and Mile. Roeeta, Miss Wordrageo. and Messrv. SchnTtxe and GoodwllTJe, the quartette. Weneed sot say that the chorus is difficult. That is palpa ble enough to any one who heard it. The Men nerchor snnaounted the difficulties, however, and gave the grand Ode to Joy in an admirable manner. Among all their choral efforts the Mwu nerchormsy claim this as their best. The Centennial Is at an end, and the thinks of every lover of music are doe Mr. Balstkt, his ad mirable orchestra, and the Mgnnerchor. for the superb music they have given os and the excel lent manner In which they hare rendered It.

Secretary Belknap was before the House Com mittee on Military Affairs yesterday. The bill of • Senator Wilson, which passed the Senate, for ex tending the time ol mustering out supernumerar? officers from January 1 to July i, was under con sideration. The Secretary said tne principal ar gument against the hill was one of economy, for if It passed, the appropriations lor the War De ganment would nave to be increased about 1200,000 beyond the estimated, to give six months more pay to these officers, while the argument in favor of tie btr was solely that of extending the ume six months longer, which would be so act ol ktndcets to officers who, without such legisla tion, most abioptly leave the service tn a fort night. The number of officers to be Urns mas tered oat he estimated at from issno 180, of whom about one-half ooght to go oat for inefficiency and other causes. The remainder of the officers, who were supernumerary when the Army bill passed at tne last session, have been assigned to Oil va cancy*. placed open the retired mi, or have re signed. the number thus disposed of being more than 200. The committee were not agreed on the question of extending the time. The bill was laid over tm Monday for further action. The orders received at the Internal Revenue Bureau Indicate a belief throughout the West that the Stamp act will be abolished at this session of Congress, a; least, so far as documents are : con cerned.
