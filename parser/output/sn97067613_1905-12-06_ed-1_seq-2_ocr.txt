Raspe Exodus, 33-19, "I will make all my good ntBH to puna before then," Every man, woman and child lias somettjiug to bu tu.iuklul for. Nj Iii is desi it iite of heaven sent blessings. God's ttooduess is constantly made manifest to u in all walks ot liti in the nation aud in the ntnti; in the city and iu the count r.; in the chinch and iu the home; in prosp'-rt'y and in adversity; in health and in ciokuess Ever wirti us ii the hpiric of the Fattier, to bless and consult; toguiird and to guide; to reward and to for givi ; to strengthen to iuvigorateand to siive from earth-scorn bondage; to rescue from the whirlwind of sin; to protect from the cold olastolpiej udicf : to lead over the rough places of lile beset with' the snares of the tempter; toe pitlalls of carually Oieu thoughts, the sorrows heir lo the fl ;sh, the doubts murderous to faith, tiveu so every child of God is blessed, it he will but have faith iu the good ness of the Father and live as near as possible in imitation of the pure life of His beloved Son, Jesus the Christ. Let us then, not be blind to God's goodness and loving kindness, but ict us like Moses of old week to catch a glimpse ol God's faceand be thank ful lor his manifold blessiugs to us and to the cluldreu of men. That the soul who longs lor a clear sight oi God's face, who strive by thought, woni, and deed to embod. the Eter nal Christ in his life; who uueeltisLly piay to Almighty God iu glad appre ciation of all the joys and blessings ot hie has Itse't already luiUIId the promise given unto the Israelitish leudei : "1 will makeall my goodness to pass before thee." Such a i,oble soul knows the larger life aud by virtue of its knowledge will be led to glorify God and be thankful. And so the promise comes to us to day. Will we doubt God's goodness and the fulfillment of his promise? Or will we, perhaps, be so engrossed by the subtle materialism of the day, that we have no time to meditate for a season upon the various gifts; felici ties, the joys, the eucctBses the vast funds of blessings that have enriched and sanctified pur lives? Or, again, will we so far mistake the spirit ol Thanksgiving Day as to make it an annual celebration of intemperance, a feast day for the bodily gratifica tions, rather than a spiritual feast, a erlud thanksgiving for the soul? Would it not be good for us, on this hallowed day, to try and see some of the ways in which God has male His goodness known to us, right here, in our own town? His goodness is manifested to us iu the mo6t out ward aspects of our villaeo. Look ye at our situation nestled among the everlasting hills! What an inspi ration to the soul of manl As the mountain towers to the sky crowned with a cap of snow, so may our spirits rise up out of the darkness of earthly things to heights before un known, of sublimity and heavenly light, bedecked with a glory too wonderful for kings, yet well becom ing to that priceless gem, the soul of man. 0 mountain, we would olimb thy Bid, For thou art migbty, strouE and bold; Let us rest where strength aud peace abide. And love thy tender fold. Thou art our friend, etfer firm and true, One law of truth, of hope and love; Thou innpireth every soul anew, For the Father above. Thy path ia upward and onward, Symbolical of life's story; Man progressing toward his Lord, Aad everlasting glory. We are thankful for thy peace on earth, A shield and fortress thou hast ever been; A witness to both death and truth, 0 mount, we would pray and sing! , Kev. Otto S. Happe. But, apart from the symbolical and the sacred associations, there ate natural offices filled by the moun tainsthey give flow to water, mak ing our picturesque river possible; they bring about fertile soil which yields a bountiful harvest; they purify the air and with their vastness, their beauty, their sublimity they inspire the soul with energy that makes tor progress, purity and protection. Let us then, be thankful for the messages read from our mountains. Truly has God blessed us; may we open our eyes and behold how nature has beautified our village. Aside from beauty, God's goodness is passing before our eyes when we be hold the various external facilities which add to the prosperity of our town. Bu-laess, social, educational and religious advantages, all serving mankind. Comforts upon comforts, pleasures following pleasures, the goodness of God springing up in our midst. Let us be thankful I In the second place, do we not feel also, that God's goodness passed be fore us in generous provisian for education? The mental, moral and spiritual training of the young. Has not God done well by us, to give out of his bountiful store such education al advantages as we hera enjoy, dis trict schools, graded school with effi cient teachers, and an Academy to mould the lives of our young men and women. To bar out the night of ignorance and superstition, and to shed the light of knowledge into their maturing minds; to help them to be c me better citizens, to be loyal to the nation, state aud town; to bless their parents, mankind, and to glorify their God. Let us be thankful ! And again, does not God's goodness pass also to our homes, where love is and where are the suggestions for the best life of the state and the world? Truly we have been the favorite ones of God. But, my friends, think ye that God is not in your specific homes. If bv chance the Anirpl of death, or the plague of sickness, or BUSINESS CARDS.

He knows what is best for us. We, with our finite minds, cannot measure unto His thought Sorrow on our part for the bereave ment of a beloved one is natural ami right, yet should we not be glad that the departed soul has put on tne im mortal life and reigns as a star of day. Illness, too, has its place in the world or it would not exist. Nature makes no mistakes. Adversities are to strengthen us, to prepare us for enater achievements and possibili ties. Thus, often ignorantly and blindly we curse God's goodness, see ing only the immediate result. Let us look deeper and be thankful. Yet, a fourth point remains for which we are to raise our voices in elad thanksgiving. Do let us feel, that the goodness of God flows to us through all our churches! We rejoice in the catholic spirit, which speaks in this haven and answersall those who love the name of our blessed Lord and Saviour. May we not be exceed ingly thankful that hereinour midst, the churches have found the very heart of God and his goodness. That the walls of sectarian prejudices have been raised, that the larger brotherhood has become their Ideal, that the clergy has taken on the Pauline spirit of fraternity and broth? erly love and that man walks beside his comrade, not with a spirit of malice and adversecriticiem; but with the friendship of the Uhristly life in his heart. Let us praise God and be thankful! We are also glad that we are permitted to discern God's good ness, in that our churches are em bodying the one thought of present ing Divine things. Striving to per fect mankind; to elevate his soul; to bring him nearer to Christ; to teach him that he possesses an immortal spirit which must be fed with divine thoughts, and which must mature in the light of spiritual things and in the atmosphere of the heavenly. We are glad our Father, to be brought face to faca with the beau tiful thought, that ourchurches have 'so far obeyed the Christ command to bring comfort to weary souls and to bless them with the benediction of heavenly grace. Let us lift up our voices with thankful songs of praise for the divine pity and forgiveness of our heavenly Parent, which flows to the devout soul through the came and spirit of Jesus. And all these special gratitudes we group together and place them upon the altar of our thankfulness to God. It is only as we realize this, only as every good thing which we win for ourselves through our own wisdom and labor becomes likewise the gift of God, and every kindly human soul touching us with benefaction and warming our hearts to thankfulness is seen to be but a channel whereby the love, the tenderness, the infinite cherishing of All-Father enters our lives, that our gratitude finds its full est expression as a part of the Univer sal anthem of thanksgiving whereof the chorus is. "0 give thanks unto the Lord, for lie is good and His mercy endureth forever."
