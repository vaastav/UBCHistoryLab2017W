Vvv uiid the jiiilKiuviil of the hi)(hi't juiliiiul trihunul of the Stutu, is the one record tliut hu will IiIuaIi fur when nil his other infliinities hIiuII have bwii furullon. It is a ro prouch u ioii the siipivmu Executive authorities ol the Stule ; uu incH'uccu blu libel upon jiiHtice ; a litiniiliulin coiilcKoiuli ot the suboriliiiutioii tit luw to the polilicul ponvr of poluntiul ciiiuinalH, and a pcrsunul stigma upon lli l!nl',ilnnil.r ll f T.ttlt Htm, U'.i It II lllllt ............ is an empire ill wealth, power and law- loving population. It is a mockery ol ilurtranfl by llurtninfl ; an exhibition of pelulcnee and uiiKurrunted iinputu lions upon otliciK that tu'lly jars with his proverbially char and deliberate judgment, and it accuses bim us no mingled eiinmng and bate eould uecure bim, ol sell procluiiued synipathy with a leader ot murderers, whose deluded sluves have peopled sixteen gibbets, in obedience to bis promptly anil willingly signed death wari'uuls. So grave ii.puhlie paper fro n llieCbiel Mugislruteot t he. Slate on sogruve a sub ject, should be aeiupulously free from errors of fact and errors of act uation. II is statements that "the attempt Iroin the fust to muke political t upital out ol the (Kehoe) cum', and to pn jmliee the publie against the possible I'uvoruble action of the authorities ;" that there was " uiit'ommon anxiety to push tech. nieulilies to exitcluehs to secure bis (Kcboc) conviction and execution lor a crime of filiten yeurs' standing ;" that he "preferred loieat a lillle longer under the imputation uhich has been indiistriuusly eiicululed since the trial, rulher thun erect the gallous in a po litical campaign," and that "whatever polilicul advantago could be gotten from tnuking the pardon or execution of a criminal a polilicul question, I tie- sired the opposition to wholly enjoy,'' are most unbecoming in tbe chief ud. minietrutnr of the laws, because ull ure wuntitig in dignity and most ol them essentially wunling in truth. The only peisons who havo given polilicul consequence to the case of Kehoe are d'oveinor Ilartruult him self, his ti listed and honored pulisun friends who ore proven traders injus tice in Hurtrafi's name, and the trim inuls with whom they truded. On these points we are not left to conjee tore. The sworn testimony of John J Slattery In tho trial of Alexander Campbell, in Carbon county, should havo been sudli ient of iiself, however lightly Governor Hurlrui'ill may huve regarded bis solemn oath to administer the luws, to make him pause and con template the nil lull into which he bus fallen. Mr. Klulleiy is n merchant ol Tuscaroro, Schuj Ikill county, enjoyed more popular respect than any other known member of the Mollie Mugiiires, and was once the cuudiduto of the Democratic party for Associate Judge in bis county. He testified in the Campbell case in 1876, that Kehoe pro posed to or agreed with bim, during the Gubernatoi ial contest between llurlruiilt and Pershing in 1875, to transfer tho vole of the Mollie Muguire to Ilarlranfl for cash consideration Major General SiglVicd, who received bis military commission from Uariraiill and who was then and is now the in cumbent of the sinecure but lucrative office ot Inspector of Boilers by the fuvorof Uurtranft, and wes communis cated with on the subject, and he asked delay until be could confer with parties at Ilarrisburg. lio promptly visited tbe State C'u,tul and telegraphed tbe Mollie Mugoiro contractors to meet bim at his (Sigfncd's) borne in 1'otts villo that evening. As requested, Ke hoe, Slnttcry, Dunning, Chairmnn of tho Republican County Committee, and Judge i'.yon, met ut Sigfried's bouso, and tho contract for tbe deliv ery of the Mollie Maguire vole to Uurt ranft wus then and there agreed upon in detail, and some twelve or thirteen hundred dollars paid to each of tho Mollie Maguire leaders Kehoe and Slattery. Kehoo was then County Delegate of the Ancient Order of Hi bernians, the highest position in the order in the county. That Kehoe and bis followers did support Ilurtranfl against Pershing for Governor in 1875, is ono of tho now undisputed facta of that contest, and that Hart ranlt's friends lost their money by losing quite an equal number of repu table Republican votes in tho more in telligent and law-abiding portions ol the county, is abundantly demonstrated by an examination of tho returns. One year thcreulter, Kehoo was arrested lor murder. Whim first arrested, he was hilarious in his defiance of bis ae cusers, although six distinct niurdon were laid to his charge, hut as public opinion asserted its sunctily for the majesty of luw and the saluty of socie ty, be learned thai the manipulation of juries was ended and that bis con demnation was probuble. It was then that he declared bis last rcfugu his one aourco of safety even against the highest judgment of the law, and that relugo was Governor llsrliunll. Mr. George Byerly, Warden of the prison, tustiQed in the trialof Kehoe.tbal Keboe clared to him that "tbe old man at Har risbnrg (Ilurtranfl) would not go back on them." Incarcerated In prison as a murderer, with six known murders charged against him, and with convic tion regarded as inevitable, be sum moned tba plighted fuitb made lo doubtless not by llartranft, and defied tho law and all tbe instrumentalities of justice. Of these sworn declarations, mada in open Court under the so verily of tbo rules ol evidence and of cross-examina tion in a capital trial, Governor Uart- ranf. had lull knowledge, for they were published and commented upon by tbe puulio journals at tbo time. They were the agencies which invested the case of Kehoo with political interest, and it was tho highest and holiest offi cial duty of Governor llartranft lo ac quit himself, If ho could, by so admin istenng the laws as to defy theimpula tion ol Killlical obligation, to the leader of banded murderers. He tailed to do so. He x ecu ltd tbe hapless slaves of tbe County Delegate, Rome of whom were proven to have committed their irihicii TTriRtfrciKjo tu ftviicA . iHnv'iifi- tory orders. There was no tremor, no licHlatiuii, uo apuluy to criinii, when they were consigned by bisdeulb war runts to tbe gallows, nor did be consult the et'imoim or the uhb or flow of pulili eul uiuiflicti when bo nietiMircil the number of their days. They weie powerless ; they eouiinunJed no follow ing ; they hail iiiieonliucls of the past, no votes lor delivery in iboluliii'e; there were none to timlie " political capital ' i.'.tw thuiri'a-ei,ttnil ihey uieJ unwept mivu hy the smitten hoUNehiihl gods ot their lowly homes, liut when the lile of Kehoo wits to be weighed ill the scules of jiiHtice ; when he hail been convicted before one of the most im pnrlial ami capulile Judges of the State; when the full Court ol throe Judgoi Icnrned in the luw, patiently heard the motion for a new trial uud refused il, and when the Supreme Court unani . . , , ...i,,,.,,,.,, ,s ,i, , ' ....... lower Court, distinctly declaring tht1 Verdict to be in accord with both the luw and the evidence, the most dis graceful jugglery Ihut blois the admin istration of justice in Pennsylvania, was played between the Hoard of Par dons and HurlruiiH losave Kehoe from' thu penalty of tho luw. We spcuk plainly because Govurnot Hurt rault bus tiiudo il necessary. He hud resolved, lor reasons we cunuot ussutne to stale lor liim, lluil Kehoe should not be ex ecuted. His desire lo reach clemency in the case arid escape absolute re sponsibility fir it himself, was an open secret ; and tho melhod preferred was to delay by every possible pretext un til hu could end his leriii uiul ihusgno Kehoo over lo his successor under thu custom, now a universally respected luw that torbids uuu Governor lo issue a death warrunt when his predecessor hud opportunity lo do so. Thu Bourd of Pardons, two of whom were bisowu confidential Cubiuel olllcers (Secretary Quuy and Attorney General Lour), was obedient to his purpo.to On January 7, 1877, the Supreme Court decided that Kehoe had been legally and justly condemned, and the counsel ol Kehoe, oneof whom w usol llie Kehoe Slattery party ut General Siglricd's home to burier for Ilartruult in 1875, according to Sluttery's testimony, well under stood that delay was safety. They inado no formal effort for purdon or couimutution until after the death war rant bad been issued in March and then I hey appeared with thuir prayer for a hearing. It was granted us they well knew il would he ; tho denlh warrant wus recalled by llarlrunft, and ihe Hoard of Pardons decided by a lie vote not to recommend clemency. Attorney General Lear then voted silh Secretary McCandless against saving Kehoe, and Secretary Quuy und Lieutenant Governor Lulta voted to commend him to the Executive tavor. Tim fuels ol tho case were then tein porutcly sluted by this journal, and ihe tiovci nor appealed to nol to, permit the udniinistrulion ol justice to become involved in number polilicul struggle, us it was in 187"). Neither at thai time, nor at any lime ihercaltcr, did we demand llie life of Kehoo. On the contrary wo urged the Governor lode cide the c.tso ou its merits ; and if in his judgment Keboe bad been convicted mainly by reason of bis general bad character, or by the tide of passion thut followed the exposure of ihe ilol lie Muguire murders, or if there was alter discovered evidence that throw any reasonable doubt upon the issue of his guilt, we declined that the law loving people of all parlies would sus tain In in in refusing to execute Kehoe, We begged him to dispose ol the case manfully as Us exceptional importance merited, and warned him tliul with tho law unexecuted while its judgment was unquestioned, and Kehoe in prison dur ing a desperate partisan battle neither the Executive nor the administration of justice could escspo the gravest Im putations of perfidy in tbe one or un pardonablo weakness in both. And this journal but spoke and appealed as did the entire unshackled press of the Commonwealth, and they voiced the universal conviclionsol honest cilixens. Hut Governor llurtrauft hailed and turned the hopes of tbe criminal classes of tho Slate low urd the very fountain ol authority. Uud he halted bravely he would have commanded respect; but be baited, trembling us bo halted, and counseled only with Ins fears ol something that was undeclared to the world. Tho Board of Pardons was made the Utile sand pilo into which he thrust bis bead. It was made to re consider tho case, ostensibly to decide whether tbe sentence should bo com muled to imprisonment lor life just what had been decided before: and tor three months tbo Hoard plnyed Hurt- ranlt's purl, by delay on various pre texts, until .September, when a tie vole again decided lo refuse a rcconimcndn lion lor clemency. Heeielury Quay having retired from tho Cabinet to be come Recorder of Philadelphia, See re tury I. inn had succeeded him, and Linn, being until illed in running shuri curves, hu relused lo follow Quay and luvor Kehoe. But ns onool llurlianft's Cabinet bad lallen out of line, hu bad Atloiliey General Leal', ol liUle Use beyond playing mlitical jumping jack, in a beer lint, and Lear was made to revel se Lear and lavor Ihe reprieve be had opposed belure. Lear uud Latta voted lo save Kehoe in September, and Linn and McCandless voted lo execute the judgment ot the law.

They in voku the searching criticism of the ad minislralioii that thus sulks ut the altar of justice when murder by the potential partisan is to be punished. They recall how tho prison doors swung open for Maiaiind Dougherty lo givo llartranft the support of cor. nipt adverse elements in 1872 ; bow del nuchcry ran riot in ibis cily and fraud held high carnival to make bim Governor; how Dougherty wus killed by his in irderous u-s icuttes wilhm a few months thereafter ; how Mum wus speedly returned to prison for a mur derous attempt upon ihe life of one of his benefactors who hud contracted for his deliverance, and how llurtrauft pardoned Mara for bis second illustra lion of bis murderous purpose, which met and vanquished juslieo by politi cal potvor. They remember how the partisan organs of the Governor in the coal regions, have been compelled to denounce his prostitution of the pur doning power in lulllllliient of political contracts; how Beamish mock, the luw and defies justice boeuuso be Is stronger than the law ilsell, and bow ballol-slulfors and embezzlers have found ready barter tor clemency in ex change for political debauchery. They remember bow Delancy, yet in office in tho Kxecutivo Chamber, has been an open polilTiil broker between justice and crime, without offense to Governor llurlrunll; and, with these momories quickened by the Governor's intemperate disrespect for the courts, the luw, for his own high office and for himself, the letters of IliftrnnO. and Lear will bo accepted as the wiurd echoes of the Kehoo contract at the Sigtried conference in 1875, and of the Kehoe trust in llartranft that be hissed ut tbo law through the prison bars in 187G. Tho Ancient Order of Hibernians promptly acquitted ilsell ot the slain of the Kehoe murderers by cutting off from the order tho organization in the counties of Luzerne, Schuylkill and Northumberland; the courts havo been fuithfiil to the law even in tbe tempest of murder; public sentiment bus asserted its omnipotence and made a smirched Kxecutivo smito as he pleaded his sympathy with crime, and to Governor Uarlranfl and Attorney General Lear belong the exceptional distinction ol confessing that, but for their tears, tho murderer would be master ol the administrator ot juslieo in our boasted Commonwealth.
