MESSAGE PLEASES SPAIN Ministry Accepts President McKinley's As surances of Good Will. Senor More*, However. Renenti the Implied Threat of Intervention In Cote Autonomy Falls. A dispatch from Madrid to the New York Evening Telegram yesterday says: Taken as a whole, the impression created here by President McKinley's message Is very good. Although individual ministers refused to give personal opinions on the matter, a dip lomatist who enjoys the entire confidence of the cabinet?the time who replied so effectively It. the Herald to Estrada Palma ?made the following statement for the Evening Telegram: "I am only echoing the opinion of the en tire cabinet when I say that the message is regarded as extremely favorable to Spain. "It recognizes, amply, her rights. It ren ders Justice to the efforts of the present government to restore order, peace and prosperity to the island. "It expresses plainly the opinion that the autonomy contained in the decree lately issued is generous and ample, and admits quite as plainly that the insurgents have no further excuse fcr opposition and claim ing iecogmtion of belligerent lights. "1 am ceitain that the ministers of the cabinet arc- gratified to a degree, and re gard the message as a most hopeful indi cation of the ultimate success of Spain's efforts. At the same time, others among the ministers feel certain that certain clauses in the message call for some protest." M. Moret is believed to be among these latter. The diplomatist says: "President McKinley says under certain conditions that if Spain, after having a fair chance to put the reforms into opera tion, is without complete success. the nited States, in the cause of humanity ?inu in the interests of commerce, will be compelled to interfere. Now, what does 'a fair chance' mean? Does it mean, as we Spaniards hope it does, that the Insurgents will understand that filibustering will lie suppressed? That those found guilty of fomenting resistance will be_ severely punished? , "I'1r ,his CHSe Spain asks nothing more success of her efforts there. . e arc thousands. In fact, a majority of the population of the island, who ardent ly long for peace, who desire only to en Joy the lioerty granted them now. If those who remain intractable find all hope of help from the I nited States cut off on the one hand and are opposed, on the other hand, by the remainder, the war will be totally at an end within two months. "But suppose they think by keeping In arms tne 1 nited States will Interfere with Jf* cer^a*n time? The sreopraphicaP con ditions of the island and the nature of the conditions prevailing^ there might enable ihem to keep up a scattered, desultory war fare for an indefinite period. In fact, the hope of future help from America would ?.a Premium on insurrection. Remember that a large number of the ir"?rn.,s nre not any more infatuated with independence than with autonomy. j remain up in arms because the con hatem ?* pcaceful la,'or are what they "Therefore. I repeat. President McKin le> s message in reference to 'a fair chance' means that. say. for perhaps a year the insurgents will be cut off from every form H' '"hort' Spaln ,s left 10 deal with h<r own people in the fairest s-mit of humanity and a desire for reconciliation ami Justice, the insurrection in such event must ( le out v.ithin a couple of months This interpretation of Presiden McKin ley s message is not accepted. "It is believed fhe references, such as above, were intended by the President to pacify a certain section in Congress."

James Mickey, who is not an Irishman, as his name would suggest, but a coal black negro boy. about eighteen years of age, was sentenced to Jail by Judge Kim ball in the Police Court this morning for assaulting a colored girl named Maggie Mason.
