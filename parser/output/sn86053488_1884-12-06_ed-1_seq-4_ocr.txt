MILAN" EXCHANGE . W. A. WADE, 1'ublisher. TerMv$1.50 perainnm In Adraace. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1884. While in Nashville the other day, Judge Ferris, "the orphan's friend" informed us that the Randall Cole In dustrial School aud Farm had been chartered and that provision would he made to receive youths of all eex es and colors, keeping them separate. Workshops will he erected, a good school opened, and everything he made confortable. The idea is to provide a place of correction for youth ful and incorrigible violators of the lw for tlje whole state, with the view of reforming and making useful citi zens of them, instead of sending them to the penitentiary, where their asso ciates would be only the hardened adult criminals. The Judge has worked faithfully for this scheme for many years, and the munificent liber ,ality of Col. E. W. Cole in donating a large and well-improved farm for this purpose has made the plan feasi ble. We trust the incoming legisla ture will amend the criminal laws so that the plans of these charitable gen tlemen can be successfully carried out and that a liberal appropriation may be made for its maintenance. At a thanksgiving sermon in ) Wheeling, West Virginia, Rev. Dr. J. E. 'Smith "alluded to the growth of the country, and epoka of the elecs tion of Cleveland and the supplanting ! of a party which controlled the gov ernment for a quarter of a century by another party, and said that in no oth er nation on the globe could this be without war and bloodshed. But, he added, there is one shame, one blight, one crime on the present page of our history which the Almighty will yet wipe out as he did the former shame aud crime, slavery. He then arraign ed the Solid South, accusing the Democrats of disfranchising, defraud ing and bull dozing the blacks, and denounced the recent alleged election of Cleveland as fraudulent and shameful." Mr. Lee Fitzgerald, late of the lo cal staff of the Nashville American, has accepted a position as assistant editor of the Christian Advocate, of which his father is editor. He is a sprightly, live newspaper writer "a chip of the old Mock' and will be a valuable addition to the Advocate force. His associates of the American presented him wiih a valuable raouo- rram diamond ring as a mark of their esteem when he left them. Louisville Times: Gen. Logan of course goes down wun tne liiaine craft; but so far he has not made him self a confounded fool about it. Logan has fought too many hard battles to go on into a corner ana wnimper or get on a platform and rave and rant because he is beaten iu one of the greatest contests of his life. He con ducts himself iu the presence of defeat like the true soldier that he is and wins the respect of honest men of all parties by his manly acceptance of the inevitable. But; all good men may now proper ly, pertinently and patriotically in . quire, whether a century's experience does not justify a thorough coosidera tion of the necessity for extending the Presidential term; for withholding the franchise from public servants; for greatly shortening campaign periods; aud for fixing election dates in other than business seasons. The Current. Congress met last Monday. It is thought that very little busiuess will be done before adjournment for the holidays. Ihe Presidents message was read and referred. It will be found On the inside of this paper, and the reader can digest it at his leisure. Texas gave Cleveland a plurality over limine of only 164,000 and a democratic majority of 128,021 over all. Texas is -a grand state, and if Clevelaud docs not give her a cabinet officer we shall always think ' be is ungrateful. Mr. Duncan R. Dorris, one of the best city editors and short hand repor ters in the state, has returned to his old love, the Nashville American. The nress of the state will welcome a him back. The only bar that tramps are un familiar with crowbar. Frankfort Yeoman. You forget bar of soap, neighbor. They seem to be less familiar with that than with any other. Gov. Hamilton, of Illinois, decided that Leman, republican, was elected iu Chicago. This leaves the legislas ture a tie on joint ballot. The Vicksburg (Miss.) Herald, Democraic. neatly retorts: "The Cincinnati Commercial Gazette, among other lies of wonderful dimen sions, says there is a reign of terror in the south. Ihe uegro laborers are reaping a rich harvest in the cotton and sugar fields, and they know of do terror whatever. They are many times better ofl than the Hocking Val ley miuers and other fearfully op pressed In borers in the North." The Muifreesboro Fne Press b serves that the Democratic party in Tennessee at this time has too many articles in its creed. "Its platform by the addition of non-essentials has be come so large that hardly any one man can swallow it all. little things are made tests of Democracy that should be regard e'd as inditfereut."

At Clarksville, to-night the jury in the caseoi w m. morrow, as principal, ana Ransom Morrow and Dr. P. F. Bela- my, charged with the murder of James lirown, colored, seven years ago, re turned a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, with mitigating circumstances. ' The jury was out from 4 till 8 o'clock, and the result of the trial created great excitement un account of the high social position aud wealth ot the accused. Ihe trial had been in progress for a week. Many witnesses were examined aud tne best legal talent n Montgomery County was represented on both sides. It was one of the most sensational cases ever heard iu the South. It was proved by a witness that Wm. Morrow made a confession as to the murder. Mor row said that Brown had attempted to outrage Mrs. Bellamy; that he met Brown iu the woods, shot him six times with a revolver and theu went tochurch. When found the body was partially burned, several pieces of wood having been placed on the corpse. Belamy was afterwards tried for the murder and acquitted. Another wit ness was told by fUnsnru, Morrow and Dr. Belnmy that Wm. Morrow had committed the deed. All the witness es to the confession were threatened with death if they revealed what hud been told them. It was also sworn that Ransom Morrow and Belamy had induced William Morrow to kill Brown. The defendants are also charged with murdering Nick Over ton, colored, and hiding bis corpse in a cavr. liiey are also mentioned in connection with the killing of two men named Sligh. Walker Blaine's Scheme. "Walker Blaine," says a Washing ton dispatch to the Springfield Re publican, "is really a candidate for the vacant judgeship of the Court of Alabama Chums, although it is place requiring a large knowledge of marine law, and he never had any law practice, save in his position as Assis taut Attorney before this court, where his career has been far from brilliaut. The judgeship is worth SG.OOOayear, The President has Ultimate! that he will make the appointment if Mr Blaine personally requests it. The historian ha? been known to declare wiihin three months 'hat he would not enter the portals ot the White House again during the Arthur administra tion. Paternal affection may vet pre vail over wounded pride."
