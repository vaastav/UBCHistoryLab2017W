l- BROWRSYILIiRAID TREATED BY IAFT Cood of tlie Service Demanded Discharge of Colored Soldiers. MURDERERS SHIELDED BY SERVANTS OP LAW Men Sworn to Support Govern ment Hid Facts of Crimes, He Reports. $pe*!al to The Journal. Washington, Dec. 6."There-can be doubt that the squad of men who moved. together from the fort to" this town and did this shooting were guilty of murder in the first degree. He (In- spector General Girlington,), became convinced* that there was a conspiracy of silence in the battalion to protect the criminals and while he concede^ that there might be a" number of niren innocent both of the crime and of the suppression of evidence, he deemed it necessary, in the interest anid for the good of the service to recommend the issuing of the order, which he had told the men would be made and enforced, unless evidence pointing to the crimi nals was forthcoming." The above are extracts from the an nual report of Secretary of War Taft, issued yesterday, in which he reviews nt length the discharge of three com panies of colored soldiers as the result of tha "shooting up" of Brownsville, Texas. President Eoosevelt has been criticized for indorsing the order of General Garlington, but Secretary Taft's report is eloquent in the defense f the attitude of his chief. Soldiers Shielded Slayers. Every effort was made to clear the mystery that enshrouded the raiding of the little Texas, town, says Secretary Taft, bufethe secret has proved impen etrable. It was not the desire to dis charge the entire battalion for the crimes, which evidence indicates were committed by members of the battalion, but the knowledge that a single battal ion of soldiers, which harbored from nine to twenty murderers, would Btrike terror in the hearts of any com munity in which it chanced to be sta tioned, forced the issue. Every angle of the affair is treated !n the report. The evidence, with a few exceptions, points against the soldiers. The bullets which were with reck less abandon into houses and hotels, one of which killed a barkeeper and another that seriously wounded the chief of police of Brownsville accord ing to reliable testimony, were of the caliber and model of those used in the new army service rifle. Expressions shouted by the raiders as they pursued theif murderous march thru the town indicated that they sought to avenge the slights of which they had been the brunt.

On the succeeding year he was firmly convinced that his life would end on the anniversary .of her death. As the day approached he became visi bly weaker.

Smith, 2920 Garfield avenue S. The Chappell family at Jefferson City, Mo., were Mr. Jones' owners in the antebellum days. The records of the births on the old plantation in Halifax county, Virginia, had been carefully preserved and the birth of Morgan Jones- was entered Aug. 10, 1805. Only the other' day Mr. Jones was recalling slavery days" in the south. "My earliest recollections,'' he said ^are of the old plantation days in Vir ginia, I can remember the big White house of the family and the little negro cabins. I spent my "early days in the tobacco fields. I was a giant in those days, and was told by a slave dealer and my master that I was the strongest one of my. race in the south. "In 1823 I moved with my 'white masters out to Missouri. I then became coachman for the family and was with them until the emancipation proclama tion. As coachman I was able to look about and take "notice, and you-.toay be sure that I watched the growth of the abolition movement. As soon as the slaves were pronounced free I started for Minnesota and have been in Min neapolis ever since."

Generally speaking, the colored peo pie ot the District of Columbia are sat isfied with the situation, but there are i'Bome hotheads, including among them, unfortunately, some of the lightest col ored of the hybrid raop, whfr have de termined that if the. government wins a successful test case 4a Sa Francisco they ,wili have a similar one instituted here in Washington. It. is easy to see therefore,' that if the government persists in its conten tion that an alien cannot be forced to go to a separate school, unless all other aliens are forced' to go to the same school there will be a splendid chance for foreign-born colored men in the District of Columbia to stir u a' dis agreeable muss. some'' Its members are counting on very hearty co-operation on the part of northwest ern people along* all lines* Marshall to. GQ Into .-Field. [While Representative Marshall was gjoing over the situation with Commis sioner Lane, he evinced- such a remark able grasp of-thed situation that-the aske him if he could possibly get away from his congres sional duties for the purpose of re turning to the northwest? and assisting in the work of collecting testimony. Mr. Marshall said that he would be glad to go if by so doing he could be of any help. Mr. Lane replied that he could be of great help and it was agreed that Mr. Marshall should leave Washington in time to arrive in Min neapolis by this week Saturday and in North Dakota by next Monday morn ing. This will give him a chance for a week of hard work before the Min neapolis hearings begin. It will be Mr. Marshall's dutvto look up_ evidence of a character that the com mission wants to see that men who are competent to testify are rounded up and brought to, Minneapolis. He will spend the week in traveling over his state and in writing and telegraphing constituents regarding the shortage. Fortunately for this mission, there will ^e nothing going sm in congress be tween now and the noliday recess which will require Mr. Marshall's p/esence in Washington, and he can therefore go away on this particular errand with*1 out neglecting his congressional busi ness. The real work of the session will not be taken until after holidav recess. Reciprocal Demurrage Remedy. Mr. Marshall has been giving a good deal of consideration to the question of remedies and has about made up his mind that the shortage evil can best be met by some kind of reciprocal de murrage legislation which will require the hauling of freight in* the order of its delivery -to the road by shippers. With this idea in mind he, is getting copies of reciprocal demurrage bills that have been introduced into various jSl state legislatures in the past few yoars and will look them over carefully after the holidays with a view to introduc ing a bill in congress, should the char* acter of the testimony taken at the Minneapolis hearing warrant. Commissioner Lane said this morning that he hoped the Minneapolis hearing might be concluded in five or six days. This, he thinks, ought to be a sufficient length of line, provided special agents and othersjiow at work in the field col lecting evidence, including Representa tive Marshall, succeed in securing enough specific facts.

The president's action in calling. Viscount Aoki, .the Japanese ambassador, to the White House for a conference in connection with a new treaty with Japan has mystified offi cials in Washington in view of the rad ical statements in his message. The Japanese ambassador made his visit yesterday and discussed with the pres ident a proposition to negotiate an en tirely new treaty, specifically recogniz ing the right of^each country to ex clude the laborers of the other. Such a provision is contained in the present treaty, but both the president and the Japanese ambassador thought it would satisfy the pride of the Jap anese if their rights to treat the Amer icans as the Americans treat them were recognized. Would Shut Out Laborers. Such a treaty would be easy to have ratified by the senate. It would almost inevitably be followed by a Japanese exclusion law, barring out all laborers from the mikado's islands. Our labor ers'would thereupon be'barred by Ja pan. It was said today that Secretary Root, under the direction of the presi dent, is actually engaged in the nego tiation of a new treaty with Japan which will specifically admit the peo ple of that nation to the same rights of education as are granted to European aliens, no more and no less. If it be true that such a treaty is being nego tiated it will never ge^ farther than the inside of- the senate. The present sentiment in that body is such that not over 10 per cent of the republicans and none of tKe democrats would vote for a treaty which in any way attempted to limit th*e rights of a municipality or of a state to manage its own school system. If there is a decision at San Francis co sustaining the government on the ground that the citizens of friendly na tions must be treated alike under the favored nation clause of our commer cial treaties, an entirely new situation will be presented here in the District of Columbia. 90,000 Negroes Wait Decision.

Using the same cunning with which, as charged* he concocted the plot to lure pretty "Billy"' Brown to her death, Gillette has been frustrated in what is believed to have been a bold effort to end his own life.
