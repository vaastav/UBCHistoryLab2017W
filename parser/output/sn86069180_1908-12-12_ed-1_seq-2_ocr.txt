Clua natter Address all Cononolcatloai to the KENTUCKY IRISH AMERICAN 33537 Weat Oreea St 3 TRADES COUNCIL Y LOUISVILLE KY SATURDAY DECEMBER 12 1908 1 THROW XO STONES I I The editor of the Syracuse Catholic i Sun must be sure at his brethren In the South Last week he wns moved to remark One is filled with somewhat of amazement that no newspaper editor has been shot and killed In the South for more than two weeks All the crime is not In the South neither arc all the mur der committed jn the South lbc most horrible crimes and murdi mysteries in the United States ar committed north of the Ohio river The old admonition concerning pe pie who live in glass houses might be taken to heart byour esteem contemporary WASTED WORDS If Congress would enact oneten of the legislation recommended b President Roosevelt in his Intest message the United States would be I greatly benefited Unfortunate the trusts and moneyed Interests of the country control a majority of < United States Senators and llepr sentativcs and it is extremely doubtful ful If one of the measures recom mended by the President will gJ through No Democrat will or can agree with Mr lloosevelt in all his 1 recommendations and yet his mes sage furnishes not only food for re 1 flection but shows that our Chief Executive aims at the betterment ot the masses Although a Congressional Comm tes is now engaged in tinkering with the tariff the President ignores thnt question altogether He unhesitatingly ingly admits that the Sherman ant1 trust law is n failure and can not be 1 enforced He urges Congress tl I enact a law permitting corporations to exist under Government super vision and also advocates greater publicity in corporation affairs Of course the trusts and corporation will fight to the last ditch to proven any such legislation Nor arc tht greatly afraid They know that President Roosevelts administrate will end within three months anrt 1 they have no idea that his successor will prove inimical to their interest The President also urges drastic measures for the protection of the wage worker but there are few foolish enough < to believe that the present Congress will pay any heed to his admonitions None doubt his dictum that labor should have a greater share of the national wealth but will the great corporations of the country permit legislation looking to that end Ills advocacy of the extension of the savings bank system and the author ization of postal savings banks inuj meet with the approval of the masses but will a majority of our national legislators pay any heed to the advice of a man so soon to retire from office In March President Roosevelt will step down and out He has no more pie to distribute and consequently can influence few votes in either branch of Congress Advices from the mountains show that Republicans in the Eleventl Congressional district of Kentuckj paid more attention to Caleb Power in jail than since he was pardoned AAttorney R S Rose a brotherinlaw of Powers was a candidate for Com monwealths Attorney in the Twenty sixth Judicial district which includes many mountain counties Caleli Powers stumped the district for him and Rose was hopelessly beaten This ought to put an end to Calebs Congressional aspirations u Dr I N Bloom one of the School Trustees from the Sixth and Seventh wards in answer to an editorial in the Louisville Evening Post pre sented the editor with a few pertinent facts The Doctor does not hesttdte to say that the Louisville school system stands very low in comparison with other cities of Similar size lIe does not leave thn editor of the Post a leg to stand oa D Hyland Kusclls idea to give the clerks of the various Louisville stores and business houses a three days holiday at Christmas is meeting with popular Savor In some lines of busi ness lt will not be possible to make stich a concession but the majority of employers will readily grant the desired cessation from labor I IE yon are in business and believe I te
