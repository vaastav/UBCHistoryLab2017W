ASSASSIN'S TRIAL. The Great Question ot Gultean's Sanity Now Under Consideration by Uw Court At Washington. Guiteau Is Playing the Insanity Dodge Tor All It Is Worth. Testimony Showing that He Has Been Hard Citizen, Luntttle or Otherwise. MONDAY, DKCL 8. Guiteau was late in [arriving at the court house. An immense crowd lined the sidewalks, and upon alighting from the van the assassin evinoed unusual trepidation, and begged the officers to take him around to the back entrance. He was assured hid escort was ample, and with trembling steps he quietly shuffled through the angry crowd. Dr. Eennon, managing editer of the Chicago Medical Review, gave his opinion that Guiteau was insane. The witness baaed his judgement ofGuiteau'a insanity upon hereditary taint, upon impartial judgement, excitable emotions, and upon inspirations, which also include a motive. The witness admitted that when a man committed a torime while acting under a delusion of divine inspiration and then conduct ed himself precisely as a criminal would do, it would be presumptive against his inBanity. Guiteau (angrily)—You are going too fast in this matter. We want facts, not your judge ment The witness had stated the thing right The lord injects into the spirit and then teus a manjto use his own judgement to work it it out That's just in my case. That's the way I got my inspiration. The Lord don't employ fools to do his work. He gets the best material Guiteau suddenly interrupted the examina tion, and despite Scoville's efforts to restrain him, broke out in severe denunciation of his wife, saying he had just noticed a discourse from her which was full of mis-statements, and if she came into conrt to testify against him he would show her up. Bichard J. Hinton, editor of the Washington Gazette, had seen the prisoner at the republi can headquarters in New York, and formed the opinion" that he was exceedingly ill balanced and egotistic. The witness resumed by saying that the prisoner seemed to be a per fect nuisance about the rooms, but was inter rupted by Guiteau, who retorted:- "You were a nuisance yourself. I'd rather be hung as a man than acquitted as a fool, and I won't have any more of this kind of evidence."" Dr. Chas. A. Nicholas, of Bloomdale asylum, replied to a hypothetical question proposed by Scoville: "If the evidence to which I have lis tened is correct^ I should say the prisoner is insane." Dr. Folsom, of Boston, thought if the hypo thetical proposition put by Scoville wss correct in all particulars, the prisoner was insane when he shot President Garfield. Dr. Samuel Worcester, of Salem, declined to express an opinion until counsel explained what he meant by the term "inspira'ional." Guiteau, impatiently—"When it is an inspira tion by the Deity on my mind of a thought and power foreitrn to my own will and mind. That's what's meant I've told you a dozen times." Witness was finally told by Scoville to stand aside. Dr. Wm. W. Godding, of the government asylum for the insane at Washington, thought that at the time set forth in the hypothetical 'question, if it were true, the prisoner was un doubtedly insane. Dr. James H. McBride, of Milwaukee, and Dr. Channing, of Brook line, Mass., also thought, taking all the hypothetical propositions to be true, that the prisoner was insane. »r. vr. T. tisher, of Boston, would dislike to be confined to the statement of facts contained in the hypothetical questions, .but if compelled to answer he would Bay he should judge the prisoner was insane. Witness was informed by the prosecution they would want him as a witness. Scoville announced that he had no more witnesses present and woald introduce but two or three more before closing the case. 

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6. Charles B. Farwell, member of congress from Chicago, related bow Guiteau called upon him and wanted money to buy the Inter-Ocean, and told the witness if he would loan him $200,000 he would make him president of the United States. Guiteau cried out emphatically "That is false 1 I never made any such prop osition. I asked him to invest some money in the enterprise, but he said ho had already put $10,000 in the Inter-Ocean and would not gut in any more.** He said he never thought •n. Farwell was asked the prisoner a whether GuiteM right and wronfc ville and Guiteau, Id distinguish between amidst protests from Sco answered: "There were grades of insanity,and did not think the prisoner so insane but that he could distinguish between right and wrong. Scoville desired to note an exception. Guiteau cried excitedly, "I want this understood right here. I will put a atop to all this irrelevant nonsense. I acted from inspiration. Judge Cox, well that will do?" Judge Cox replied to the prisoner, "You have said that manv times, and you were not to in terrupt the courf again." George Gorham, editor of the Republican took the stand. A discussion ensued between counsel upon the form of a question in which Guiteau insisted on taking a part. Turning to Scoville, he said, "You are getting a little cracked yourself on this subject I won't have your line of defense. It's altogether too nar row." Gorham was told to step down when Guiteau shouted out, "Come back. Gorham was relieved for the present The prisoner be came involved in an angry altercation with Scoville, in the course of which he became very violent and denounced him as ne politician ana no lawyer. "You insinuated yourself upon the defense just because you happened to be my brother-in-law." Judge Porter undertook to address the court, when Guiteau shouted im periously: "Now you just keep quiet, Mr. Judge Porter. You are altogether too talkative tbia morning." Scoville stated that he desired to have President Arthur testify in the case, and also Grant and Cpnkling. The rest of the time was occupied in reading Guiteau's book "Truth." 

WEDNE8EAY, DEC. 7. The assassin was brought in as usual, look ing very much as he did yesterday, an oda little wvotcb in k4wk emt, wlrite shirt .lid elMtding— collar encircled by an eminently respectable black necktie carefully tied. Above tne black bow knot is a sensual face, irregular in con tour with a rough skin, pimpled on the fore head, and close cut hair. He is eminently re pulsive in appearance at all times. When he is angry he becomes a snarling brute. Be addressed the court asjsoon as his hand, cuffs had been placed in the drawer of the counsel table, on the old subject The ques tion, the principal question, was as to his as piration which resulted from the political com plications of last summer and yet Scoville, blundering along on another theoiy, had sum moned none of the great leaders of the repub lican party to testify respecting it He wanted the court to issue the subpenas he asked for yesterday. Of course the court again declined, and Guiteau, changing his pleading tone to one of determination, fiercely demanded an ex ception to the ruling. John Wilson Guiteau was in tears when his brother concluded the story of his suffering and privations during his tour. He coula scarcely command his voice when he spoke to him. but4he hardhearted assassin half sneered *t lum as lie snorted out: "And what are you orying at now?" Gen. Sherman .was called to identify the let ter written by Guiteau. As he left the stand Guiteau said, '1 thank yon, general, for having ordered out the troops (hat (lay. it nadn't been for you 1 wouldn't be hwe to-day. I owe my life to the protection whioh you and Mr. Crocker gave me during that period when the mob spirit was rife." At this the general smiled grimly. E. P. Barton, a lawyer, A L. Green and G. W, Londe, all of Freeport, III, testified that they knew the Guiteau family and considered them all sane* Dr. North was the most positive witness in troduced by the defense, and by his showing the entire Guiteau family were more or less in sane. 4XHUB8DAY, DKcnant S. As soon as the criminal court opened tiii# morning, Guiteau shouted out: "A brack in Chicago says I talked with him about thiB case. I donTt know the man. It is false." CoL Bockwell called ss the first witness of the day Mrs. J. 1L Wilson of Leadville, CoL She knew L. W. Guiteau from her earliest recollections. The witness was questioned in Agard to vari ous members of the family, and stated posi tively that she never saw indications of insan ity in any of them. SpeaJdng of the prisoner's father, II W. Guiteau, the witness said: "Mv pnole, Luther, visited me frequently, and I loved him with very trader affection. Onr whole famOy were delighted with his lovely Christian character, ana each a thought as that he might in any degree be of unsound mind never entered my head. All this midst con stant interruptions from the pris oner and shoutings to others. Gniteau be caraennged at Judge Porter and shouted, Now hold your thunaer till you get te the jury, judge you are doing this sort of thing too nrter, withont noticing the outburst, continued in a most impressive man* ner to argue his point, when Guteau broke in again, "lfmnot a criminal, and I won't be nntil I un convicted. I won't have that word. You just hold your eloquenoe tillyou get at the jury»» OoL Corkhill called Geo. a Maynard, who verified on several material points the testi mony of the preceding witness. The com* was about to announce the usual reoees, when John W. Guiteau arose and said: "Your honor, I greatiy desire to make a personal ex planation. My father iadead—"Guiteau broke to, interrupting him: "Oh! shut up! and ait down! You have been vindicated." Davidge hne objected to any more side soenes. The prisoner had oontinually been allowed toin terrunt proceedings, and at this rate the trial would soonbeepmea faroa JudgeOax settled ttie matter by saying: 'I see no ocoaskm &Lr. jMy emlanation on four Jart," andthe rsoesswas tbentakea Cbtogo. «. an •M naa met the prisoner at SooVUle's summer residence in 1878. "Ihis man never saw me but onee," interruped Gui teau. The wife of Mr. Barrett testified in the same way. Howard Dunham, of Boston, testi fied to Guiteau's sanity. Scoville read the answer of President Arthur to the interrogatories. To the first and second questions, whether he knew the prisoner and how often he had ssen him, the president re plied that he knew him that he has seen him at least ten times, possibly twenty times. To the oueetion whether he had ever conversed with nim, he replied: "No, excepting tore turn the ordinary salutiona of the day, and once or twice in answer to his request to be employed in the campaign as a speaker by the republican state committee, of ,which I was chairman." To the question what political service the prisoner rendered the republican party during the presi dential campaign the answer was, "None, that I know of." The fourth question was whether or net anything in the prisoner's relations to himself. Gen. Grant, Senator Conkling or any other of the republican party to furnish him with any ground for supposing that he would receive a political position. The answer is no. The Prisoner—That is a matter of opinion. The last question was: "Did you ever give him any reason to think he could have any po litical or personal influenoe with yon?" The answer is: "I never did." The Prisoner—He never had occasion to. The next witness was Bev. B. A McArthur pastor of Calvary Baptist church, New York. As soon as helwas sworn the prisoner remarked* "I know Dr. McArthur very velL He is a nice fellow: very high toned in every way. I owe him $95." The witness began to relate how the prisoner introduced himself and wife to him (the witness) at the close of the service one Sun day, and at the same time presented a letter cf dismissal from the First Baptist church, chi- The witness told of the prisoner and wife be ing received into the fellowship of the church and of the wife later asking urgently for mon ey, handing him a promissory note of the prisoner for $100. About the 30th of April, 1871, he was sum moned to appear before the advisory commit tee to answer the charge of gross immortality There were three counts in the charge: First that-he took money which his wife earned by working in a hotel in the country and which was remitted to him to assist in supporting him and spent in dissipation with other women!. •The second count was that he had been guilty of frequent acts of violation of his marriage vows. The Prisoner (again breaking in)—I on'y mar ried that woman on ten hours' notice, and that is reason enough why I should not live with her. The Witness—The third count was that as a result of these various acts of infideiitv, be was suffering from a vile and loathsome disease. The Prisoner—That's false. The Witness—I recited these charges to the prisoner and he acknowledged the truth of every one of them. He stated that his excuse was that his wife was absent that nature's de mands had to be met and he could not resist the enticements of lewd women on the streets! The District Attorney—We present this testimony because we want to show that what the defense calls insanity is nothing more than devilishness. It was with some difficulty that the applause that greeted this remark could be quitou. When order was restored the the witness rensnmed his testi mony, and said it never occurred to him for a moment that the prisoner was other than sane. When the cross-examination was closed, the prisoner, looking up at the deck, announced that it was the cockcrow, and time to go home. O* alna inquired "How many more witnesses tike that have you, Mr. Corkhill? I think it is as outrage on the public. If you had to pay sue of that money yourself, you would go slower." Adjourned. 

FRIDAY, DEC. 6. The testimony of to-day supported admir ably the theoiy of. total depravity, and broke down much of the little left of the original in sanity theory. Friends of client and cred itors, whom he had swindled, ministers of the gospel, lawyers, doctors, business men, with one exception, they had the same story to tell —that he was, so far as their observation went, a shrewd rogue rather than an insane inno cent At the opening Dr. McArthur, of New York, again took the stand. Guiteau broke in ex citedly, and shouted out: "It is purely in the nature of a confessional. McArthur is not an expert or a lawyer, and 1 object to his telling the jury and the American people facts which I told him years ago in regard to my history." The court ruled the evidence could be admitted as tending to show the general character of the prisoner. Corkhill—Did you ever see anything in the prisoner to indioate insanity? Answer—No sir, I never did. Guiteau here broke into one of his noisy har rangues. CoL Corkhill desired the court to reelralii the prisoner, when Guiteau turned to him and said: You go slow Corkhill, yon are spotted, and as soon as this business is oVer the president will remove you." W. S. Oadwell, the physician who treated L. W. Guiteau during his last illness, never de-. tected any evidence of any mental unsoundness.' George W. Plummer was then called. Guiteau immediately scouted: "I owe this man $20, but it has cost the government $2C0 to get him here Guiteau continually interrupted, and finally the witness said to him: "It -seems that your, close relations with Deity of late have corrupt ed your manners." The prisoner latighed heartily at this sally, and said: "Well, that ain't so bad, Plummer, for a western man." "Did you ever see anything in his conduct tbat indicated unsoundness of mind?" was the next question. "No, sir," replied the witness noth ing whatever. He seemed to be a man of abil ity, vain and conceited but then he had 'late from New York city,' on his card, and we ex pected the rest." This convulsed the court Stephen JEnglish of New York, with whom Guiteau had an office hi the insurance business was asked if he ever detected any sign of in sanity, and replied that on the contrary he was a remarkably clear-headed, shrewd lawyer. He completely outwitted the .witness. Warren G. Brown, attorney at Law, of New York, was counsel for Mrs. Guiteau in obtaining a divorce from the prisoner. lie has believed the. latter perrecuy sane. The witnees was constantly interrupted by the prisoner. The witness con sidered Guiteau sharp, keen and rational Mr. McLean Shaw a counsellor of New York, detailed a portion of a conversation (terrible in import now, even then not lightly regarded) between the assassin and himself in 1872, wherein Guiteau announced his. intentions of winning notoriety if he had to imitate Wilkes Booth and kill a public man to do it The au dience (huddered as Shaw calmly and distinctly related the incident and gave the portion of the conversation re ferred to, while Guiteau grew so excited that he could scarcely articulate the abusive epithets which he showered on Shaw. Dr. Walter Kevpstor of the Northern Wis consin insane hospital and one of the best known specialists on nervous and brain diseases and insanity in this country, who has been summoned aa an expert, says tnatrhe fully be lieves that Guiteau is sane, and that his eccen trioies in the court are simply acting.

CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS. MONDAY, DM. 5. Senate.—The senate met at noon. Bills were introduced for the appointment of a tariff com mission to place General Grant on the retired list of the army: by Mr. Sherman, a 3 per cent funding bill: also A resolution regarding royalties on patents. All the senators were present except Jones of Nevada. Mr. Hill of Georgia had so far re covered from the late operation bn his tongue that there does not seem to be muoh more inco herence his speeoh than usual. The senate looks lonesome with its great lights gone, and the faces of Conkling, Blaine and Carpenter are sadly misBed. Logan, Windom, Sherman, Kellogg, Anthony, Morrill and Feiiry are the oldest and most familiar figures just now. HOUSE—All the republican caucus nominees including speaker Keifer, were elected and sworn in, as were all the members of the house except the two absentees. Mr. Keifer made a little speech on assuming the chair, in whioh he suggested that the present is an auspioious time to enact laws to guard against recurrence or dangers to our institutions and insure tran quility at perilous times in the futura Objections were made to sev eral members taking the oath of office, but they were withdrawn One incident ocourred which threw the house into convulsions of laughter. Mr. Moore (rep.) of Tennessee, is anew member, young, enthusiastic, deeply impressed with the pro found responsibilities of a representative in congress, and anxious to win fame and distinc tion. An old member would regard Dir. Moore as simply a freBh young man. When Chalmers, of tbe Mississippi "shoe sing" disttrriet, was called up to be sworn in, Mr. Moore objected. Chalmers' seat is con tested and if the rules did not require the com mittee on elections to dispose of is case, the house would assuredly have been warranted in refusing him admittance. Mr. Moore, how ever, did not content himself with entering a simple objection which would have served every purpose but he had to make a spread eagle speech, protesting in the name of justice, of law, and of humanity againat Chalmers being administered the oath. When Mr. Moore, as to whose title to a seat no question exists, came forward to be sworn, Mr. Bragg of Wisconsin arose,and with great solemnity protested in tne name of law, of justice and of Casey Young, Mr. Moore's democratic predecessor, against the swearing in ef Moore. The republicans and democrats alike shouted and screamed with laughter, and Mr. Moore, .not at all abashed, joined in the fun. Finally, all the members against whose admission objection had been made were sworn in. This was all the business done on Monday. 

TUESDAY, DEC. 6. SENATE—Mr. Windom introduced two bill! in the senate to-day at the request of Delegate Pettigrew. One was to create the state of Da kota, the other to establish the territory of northern Dakota. The bill for the former de fines the boundaries as follows: Beginning at a point on the western boundary line of Minnesota intersected by the 416th de gree north latitude, thence southerly along the west boundary line of Minnesota to a point of intersection ot the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers, thence up the Missouri and along the north boundary line if Nebraska to the 104th meridian west longitude, thence north along said meridan to its intersection with the 46th degree of latitude, toence to the place of be ginning. The rest of the present area is created inta the territory. Mr. Ferry submitted a resolution instructing the commissioner of patents to report bv bill or otherwise such legislation as enall protect all innocent purchasers and users of paienteii. under tne laws from payment of any royalty on any patented article abandoned to the public, unless claim shall be made two years after purchase or first use of the device. J?h6 resolution refers especially to drive wells, from which the people of the. west have suf fered severely through the Bharp practice of dishonest agents. The same thing is being at tempted lately in the matter of barbed wire fences. HOUSE.—Mr. Haskell offered a resolution declaring s. Campbell, delegate elect from Utah Territory, entitled to be sworn in on a pnma facie case. The resolution was under .diacHssion, a point Df order being raised against it by Cox, when the president's message was received and was read, and the question of swearing the delegate from Utah was post poned until to-morrow morning, when members proceeded to draw for seats. A resolution was adopted for a committee to repert proper proceedings on the death of P^ent Garfield. The house then adjourned until Friday, with the understanding that fur ther adjonrment be taken until Tuesday to give the speaker time to make up the lisl of committees 

WEDNESAY, DEC. 7. SENATE —Tbe senate members of the joint committee to prepare a memorial on the late president Garfield were appointed. Bills were niroducfd for ill* admission ot -K«w-Jhzlm„ into the Union to establish the department of agriculture and commerce to make trade dol lars legal tender for the allotment of lands in severalty to tbe Peoria and Miami Indians of the Indian territory granting pensions to sol diers of the Mexican, Creek, Seminole and Black Hawk war. Senator Sherman, speaking of David Davis' attitude in the senate organization, thinks the best course for the republicans to pursue is to let matters stand as they are and wait a year, when they will have a clear majority and can act without embarrassment Upon the conclusion of the morning business the chair announced that Morrill's tariff com mission resolution was the next business in or der and awarded the floor to that senator, who declined to speak at this time, and the senate adjourned. HOUSE.—Not in session. 

THUBSDAY, DEO. 8. SENATE.—Mr. Morrill made along speech on his tariff commission bill, arguing from the protective stand-point Bills were introduced providing that officers of the executive de- Eouse artments may have seals in the senate and of representatives to make wives com petent witnesses in trials for bigamy in the ter ritories to exempt bank deposits from taxation giving 160 acres of land to the widows or mi ner children of Union soldiers who served in me late war to retire United StateB judge* at a certain age in relation to the presidential suc cession. A bill passed bestowing the franking privilege upon Mrs. Garfield. The senate committees have been remodeled to some extent to give ex-Secretary Windom a place. Senator Edmunds had the chairman ship of two comhiittees—judiciary and foreign affairs. He gives up the foreign affairs to Mr. Windom. There was a desire to have Mr. Windom on the finance committee, but it could not be well arranged that way, ana he is satis fied to take foreign affairs, on which he has had large experience.

The bouse then adjourned until Tuesd y, when the introduction of bills will be allowed as on Monday. A Disastrous Fire in Chicago. The large four-story brick warehouse of D. M. Osborne A Co., on south Morgan street, Chicago, was entirely destroyed by fire Satur day moraing. The building was filled with reapers and machinery, on which there was an insurance of $1(10,000. The building itself was insured for $25,000. The loss on'stock was $280,000 and on building $40,000. The loss is total, but there wero no casualties con nected with it. The cause of the fire is unknown. Increasing Number of Failures. One hundred and seventy-three failures are reported during the last week throughout.the United States and Canada—the largest number for any one week so far this year. The in crease is mainly in the New England and west ern states. Sharp Work of a Mammoth Monopoly. The standard- oil company monopoly is having a curious and interesting oontest in Columbus, Miss. Three years ago the merchants at tbat place asked the oompany to vary the prices according to the market, and, upon being refused, combined togeth er and bought oil from other qdarters. The Standard oompany then lowered its rates, and finally got a local agent into the field to undersell the merchant's at retail, but still the latter refused to surrender, and to this day have handled none of the company's goods. Finally the monopoly has put a great quantity of the groceries into the town to he sold at cost, and a nmnii dealer who had built up a petty business in chipping dried beef for nis customers had to se& the great company set np its op position slioer next door to ponish him for refusing to sell its oil. Mr. Henry Morely, of England, recently said to a New [York reporter: "I have been greatly struck, by the immense size of the American stores, especially the dry-goods sttores.

LATE PRESIDENT, A FEELING TRIBUTE. To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: An appalling calamity has befallen the American people. tmce there chosen representatives last met in the h*iia where you are now assembled. We might else recall with unallayed content the prosperity with which throughout the year the nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous, its varied industries have thriven, the health of its people has been preserved. It has maintained with foreign governments the un disturbed relations of peace. For these manifestations of his favor we owe him who holds our destiny in his hands tbe tribute of onr grateful devotion. To that mysterious exercise of will which has taken from us the loved and illustrious citizen who was but lately the head of the nation, wo bow in sorrow and submission. The memory of his exalted character, of his noblo achieve ments and of his patriotic life will be treasured forever aa a sacred possession of the whole people. The announcement of his death drew from foreign governments and peoples tributes of sympathy and sorrow which history will re cord as signal tokens of the friendship of na tions and the federation of mankind. 

FOKEIGN RELATIONS. MAINLY PEACEFUL. The feeling of good will between our own government and that of Great Britain was never more marked than at present In recog qition of this pleasing fact, I directed, on the occasion of the late centennial celebration at Yorktown, that a salute be given tbe British flag. Aside from the correspondence, to which I shall refw hereafter, in relation to the pro posed canal across the iBtlimus of Panama, little has occurred worthy of mention in the diplomatic relations of the country. Early in the year the Fortune bay claims were satisfactor ily settled by the British government paying in the fall the sum of £15,000, most of which has already been distributed. As the terms of settlement included compensation for injuries suffered by our fishermen at Ashell bay, there has been retained from the gross award a sum which is deemed adequate for these claims. The participation of Americans in the exhibi tions at Melbourne and Sydney will be approv ingly mentioned in the reportB of the two ex­ hibitions soon to be presented to congress. They will disclose the readiness of our country to make successful competition in distant fields of enterprise. Negotiations for an internation al copyright convention are in hopeful prog ress. The surrender of Sitting Bull and his force upon the Canadian frontier has allayed all apprehension, although bodies of British Indians still cross the border in quest of sustenance. Upon this snbject a cor respondence has been opened, which promises an adequate understanding. Ou troops have orders to avoids meanwhile, all collisions with these Indiana The presence at Yorktown of representatives «f Ihe republic df France, descendants ef IflAyetto and his gallant com patriots, who Off allies in the revolution, has served to etveagthen the spirit of good will which has always existed between the two na tions. Yoii wili be tarnished with the proceed ings of THE 

BIMETALTC CONFERENCE, held during the summer at the city of Paris. No record was reached, but a valuable inter change of views was had, and the conference will next year bo renewed. At the electrical exhibition and congress, also held at Paris, the country was creditably represented by eminent specialists, who, in the absence of an appro priation, generally lent their efficient aid at the instance of tbe state department While our exhibitions in this almost distinctively Amer can field of achievement have won several awards, I recommend that congress provide for tne repayment of the personal expenses in curred in tbe public interest by the honorary commissioners and delegates. No new questions respecting the status of our naturalized citizens in Germany have arisen during the year, and causes of com plaint, especially in Alsace and Lorraine, have practically ceased, through the liberal action of the imperia government in accepting our often expressed views on the subjeot The application of the treaty of 1868 to the lately acquired Bhenish province has received very earnest attention, and a definite and lasting agreement on tbia point ia confidently expected. Tbe participation of tbe descend ants of Baron Yon Steuben in tbe Yorktown festivities and their subsequent reception by their American kinsmen strikingly evinced the good will which unite German people and our own. Onr intercourse with Spain has been friendly. An agreement concluded in Feb uary last fixes a term for the labors for the Spanish and American claims commission. The Spanish government has been requested to pay the late awards of the commission, and will, it is believed, accede to the request as promptly as on a former occasion. By recent leg­ islation onerous linos have been imposed upon American shipping in Spanish and colonial ports for Blight irregularities in manifest One case of hardship is specially worthy of atten tion. The bark Mazonica, bound for Japan, entered Manilla in distress and is there eougbt to* be confiscated under tbo Spanish revenue laws for an alleged shortage in her transhipped cargo. Though efforts for her relief have thus far proved unavailing, it is expected tbat the whole matter will be adjusted in a friendly manner. SYMPATHY WITH RUSSIA. The resolutions of condolence on the assas sination of the Czar Alexander wero appropri ately communicated to the Russian govern ment, which in turn has expressed its sympa thy in our late bereavement It is desirable that our cordial relatione with Bussia should be strengthened by proper engagements assur ing to peaceable American citizens who visit the empire the consideration which is due to them as citizens of a friendly state. This is especially needful with respect to American Israelites, whose classification with the Baltic Hebrews has evoked energetic remonstrances from this Government A consular agreement with Italy has been sanctioned and proclaimed, which puts at rest conflict of jurisdiction in the case of crimes on shipboard. Several im portant (NTFC^ATLONAZ. CONFERENCES have been held in Italy during the year. At the geographical congress of Venice, the Boni face congress of Milan, and at the Nice con gress of Turin, this country was represented by delegates of branches of the public service, or by private citizens duly accredited in an honorary capacity. It ia hoped that congress will give Bueh prominence to their participa tion as they may seem to deserve. The abolition of all discriminating duties against Dutch colonial productions of the Dutch East Indies as are imported there from Holland has been already consid ered by congress. I trust that at the present session the matter will be favorably concluded. Th9 insecurity of life and property in many parts of Turkey has given rise to correspond ence with the porte relating particularly to tbe better protection of American missionaries in the empire. The condemned murderer of the eminent missionary, Dr. Justin W. Parsons, has not yet been executed, although the gov ernment has repeatedly demanded that ex emplary justioe bedonei THK 

SWISS OOVCKMICBNT has solicited the good offices of our diplomatic and oppunlar agents for the protection of Its citizens in countries where it is not itself rep reseated.' This request has within proper limits been granted. Our agents in Switzer land have been instructed to protest against the oonductbf the authorities of oertain com munes in permitting the emigration to this ooontry of criminal and other objeetfonable peMoui Several such persons* through 1 the eo-opsitflktion f-ot ^fhe eomniis- sioners of emlgrati«i%tNew Yorlc, have been sent baek by the steamers wbidh brought them. A continuance of this coarse may prove ft more effective. remedy than diplomatic remonstrance. Trea ties of commerce and navigation and for the regulation of consular privileges have been concluded with Roumania and Per via since their admission into the family of European nations. As is natural with con tiguous states which have like institutions and like aims of advancement and develop ment, tbe friendship of tbe United States and Mexico bas been consistently maintained. The government has lost no ocoasion of en couraging the Mexican government to a beneficial realization of the "mutual ad vantages' which will "result/ for more intimate' commercial intercourse and from the opening of the rich interior of Mexico to railway enterprise. I deem it im portant that means be provided to restrain the lawlessness unfortunately so common, and to suppress the forays of the reservation Indians on either Bide of the Bio Grande. The neigh boring 'states of Central America have pre served internal peace, and their outward rela tions towards the United States have been those of intimate friendship. These are en couraging signs of their growing disposition to subordinate their local interests to those which are common to them by reason of their geographical relations. The boundary dispute between Guatemala and Mexico has furnished this government the op portunity to exercise its good offices by pre venting a rupture between those states and for procuring a peaceful solution of the ques tion. Tbe Cesta Bica government lately formed an engagement with Colombia for settling by arbitration the boundary question .between those countries providing tbat the post of mr bitrants be offered successively to the king of tbe Belgians, the king of Spain' and the president of the Argentine confederation. The king of the Belgians bas declined to act, but I am not as yet Sdvised of the action of the king of Spain. As we have oertain interests in the disputed territory which are protected by treaty engagement with one of the parties, it is important that the arbitration Bhoulil 

INTEB-OCEANIC WATERWAY acoss the Isthmus of Panama are of great na tional importance. This government has not been unmindful of the solemn obligations im posed upon by its compact of 1846 with Colombia as tbo independent and sovereign mistress of tbe territory crossed by the canal, and sought to render them effective by fresh engagements with the Colombian republic, looking to their practical execution. The ne gotiations to this end after tbey had reached what appeared to be a mutually satisfactory solution here, were met in Colombia by a disavowal of the powers which its envoy bad assured and by a proposal for ne gotiation on a modified basis. Meanwhile this government learned that Colombia had pro posed to tbe European powers to join in a guarantee of tbe neutrality of the proposed Panama canal, a guarantee which would be in direct contravention of onr obligation as the sole guarantee of tbe integrity of Columbian Territory, and of the neutrality of the canal itself. My lamenied predecessor felt it his duty to place before the European powers the reasons which make the prior guarantee of the United States indispensable and for which the interjection of any foreign guarantee might be regarded as a superfluous and un friendly aot Foreseeing the probable reliance of the British •sirsmnirnt on the provisions of the Clayton-Bww treaty of 1850, as afford ing room for ft plfcee in the guarantees which the United Btslss oonvenanted with Colombia four years before^ I have not hesitated to sup plement the aotioa of my predecessor by pro posing to her majesty^ government the modifi cation of that instrument and the abrogation 6f such clauses thereof as do not conflict with obligations of the United States toward Colom bia or with the vital needs of the two friendly parties to the compact. CHILI AND PERU. This government sees with great concern the continuance of the hostile relations be tween Chili and Peru. An early peace between these republics is much to be desired, not only that they may themselves be spared further misery and bloodshed, but because their con tinued antagonism threatens consequences which are, in my judgment, detrimental to the interests of all the republican governments on this continent and calculated to destroy the best elements of our free and peaceful civiliza tion. As in the present excited condition of popular feeling in these countries there has been a serious misapprehension of the po sition of the United States, and as separate diplomatic intercouse with each through inde pendent ministers is at the same time a serious subject, owing to the want of prompt recipro cal communication, to temporary misunder standing, I have deemed it judicious at tbe present time to send a special envoy, accred ited to all and each of them, and furnished with general instructions which will enable him to bring these powers into friendly rela tions. 

VENEZUELA CLAIMS. The government of Venezuela maintains its attitude of warm friendship, and continues with great regularity its payment of the month ly quota of the diplomatic debt Without sug gesting the direction in which congress should act, I ask attention to pending questions affect ing the destination of the sums thus far re ceived. The relations between Venezuela and France, growing out of the same debt, have been for sometime past in an unsatisfactor state, and this government, as the neighbor and one of the largest creditors of Venezuela, has interposed itself with the French govern ment, with the view of producing a friendly and honorable adjustment. COMMERCIAL INTERESTS WITH BRAZIL. I regret that the commercial interest between the United States and Brazil, from which great advantages were hoped a year ago, have suf fered from Withdrtiwal of American lines of communication between Brazilian ports and our own. Through the efforts of our minister resident at BuenoB Ayres ani the United States minis ter at Santiago a treaty bas been concluded be tween the Argentine Republic and Chili dispos ing of the long PeilditiB r«taKOniou bimud»rT question. It is a matter of congratulation that our government has been afforded the oppor tunity of suecessfully exerting its good influ ence for the prevention of disagreements be tween the republics of the Amorican continent 

TREATIES WITH CHINA. I am glad to inform you that the treaties lately negotiated with China have been duly ratified on both sides and the exebange made at Pekin. Legislation is necessary to call its provisions into effect. The prompt and friendly manner in which the Chineso govern ment, at tbe request of the United Statee, con ceded the modification of the treaties should secure careful regard for the interests and susceptibilities of that government in tbe en actment of any laws relating to Chinose immi gration. These classes of the treaties which forbid tbe participation of citizens or vessels of the United States in the opium trade will doubtless receive your approval, and tbey will attest the sincere interest of our people and government in tbe commendable efforts of the Chinese government to put a stop to this de moralizing and destructive traffic. In relation both to China and Japan, some changes are desirable TO our present system of consular jurisdiction. I hope, at some future time, to lay before you a scheme for its im provement in the entire east 

RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. The intimacy between our country and Japan, tbe most advanced of tbe eastern nations, con tinues to be cordial. I am advised tbat the emperor contemplates the establishment of a constitutional government, and tbat be has al ready Bummoaed a parliamentary congresB for tbe purpose of effecting the change. Such a remarkable step toward complete assimilation with our western system cannot fail to bring Japan to closer and more beneficial relation ship with ourselves as the chief pacific power. A question has arisen in relation to the exer cise in that country of judicial functions car ried on by our minister and consuls. Tbe indictments, trial and- conviction the consu lar court at Yokohama of John Ross, a mer chant seaman on-board an "American vessel, have made it necessary for the government to institute a careful examination of the nature and methods of this jurisdiction. It appears that Ross was regularly shipped under protection of the United States, but was by birth a British subject My predecessor felt it bis duty tp take the position that by his service as a regular shipped seaman on board an American merchant vessel Boss was subject to the laws of the service and to the juris diction of the United States ebnsulate author ties. I renew the recommendation which bas been heretofore urged by the executive upon the at tention of congress. After the reduction of such amount as may be found due to America, tbe balance of the indemnity found heretofore obtained from China and Japan, which are now to be found in the hands of the state de partment be returned to the governments of those countries. HAWA11AH ISLANDS. The king of Hawaii, in the course of his homeward return after a journey around the world, has lately visited this country. While our relations with that kingdom- are friendly, this government has viewed with concern the efforts to seek replenishment of tbe diminish ing popnlationof tbe islands from outward sources to a degree #hteh may impair the .na tive sovereignty and independence in which the United Statea wss among tbe first to testify a lively interest. V, UNIXPAIRKD AMNESTY. Relations of unimpaired amnesty have been maintained throughout the year with the re tractive governments of Austria, .Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Hayti. Paragnay and Uru guay, Portugal, and SwMen ana Norway, and this may alsobs said of Greece and Equador, although our relations %ith those states have for some years been severed bv the with drawal of appropriations for diplomatic rep resentatives at Athens and Quito It seems ex- $:W:*r v' not with­ out our consent affect onr rights, and this gov ernment has accordingly thought proper to make its views known to the parties to the agreement, as the questions growing out of the proposed inoed scale, and I decidedly recommepd sach a course with respect to EquadQr, which is likely within the near future -So play 'an im. portaht part among the nations of thersouth-: era Pacific. INTERNATIONAL BED CROSS WORE. At its last extra session the senate called for tbe text of the Geneva convention for the relief of the wounded in war. 1 trust tbat this action foreshadows such interest in the eubject as will result in the admission to that humane and commendable engagement INTERNATIONAL RULES.OF THB-ROAD. I invite your attention to tbe propriety of adopting the new code of international rules for the prevention of collisions in the high seas, and of conforming the domestic legislation of the United States thereto, so tbat no confusion may arise from tbe application of conflicting rules in the case of vessels' of different nationalities meeting its tidal waters. These international rules differ but slightly from pur own. They have been adopted .by the navy department for the gov ernance of the war ships of the United States on the high seas and in foreign waters, and in disseminating the rules and in acquainting the shipmasters with the option of conforming to them within the jurisdictional waters of the United States, they are now very generally known and obeyed. INTERN ATIOXAIi. FOREIGN COMMERCIAL REPORTS. The state department still continues to pub lish to tbe country «the trade and manufactur ing reports received from its officers abroad. Tbe success of this oourse warrants its con tinuance and aucb appropriation as may be re quired to meet tbe rapidly increasing demand for these publications with special reference to tbe Atlanta cotton exposition, the October number of the reports was devoted to a collec tion of papers on the cottdp goods trade of the world. TUB INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE for which, in 187% congress made provision, assembled in this city in July last, and its sessions were prolonged until March, although it reached no specific conclusions affecting the future action of the participant powers. The interchange of views proved to be most valu able. Tbe full protocols of tbe sessions have been already presented tq the senate. INTERNATIONAL SANITARY REGULATIONS. As pertinent to this general subject, I will call your attention to the operations of the national board of health, established by act of congress, approved March 3, 1879. Its sphere of dnty was enlarged by the act of June 22, in the same year. By the last named act the' board was required to investigate such measures as might be deemed necessary for preventing tbe introduction of contagious or infections diseases from foreign conntries into the United States or from one State into another. The execution of tbe rules and regulations prepared by the board and ap proved by my predecessor has done much to arrest the progress of epidemic disease, and has thus rendered substantial service to the nation. THE INTERNATIONAL SANITARY CONFERENCE, to which I have referred, adopted the form of a bill of health to be used by all vessels seek ing to enter the ports of the countries whose represetatives participated in its deliberations. This form has been preserved by the qational board of health, and incorporated with its rules and regulations, which have been ap proved by me in pursuance of law. The health of the people is one of supreme importance, and all measures looking to their preservation, against the spread of contagious diseases, and to the increase of our sanitary knowledge for anch pur pones, deserve the attention of oon gress rTYAXCIALu THE TREASURY. The report of the secretary of the treasury represents in detail a highly satisfactory ex hibit of the state of the finances, and tbe con dition of various branches of the public ser vice administered by that department The ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 10, 1881 were: From customs $198,159,676 02 Internal revenne 135.264,385 51 From public lands .. 2,221,863 17 From tax on circulation and de posits of national banks 8,116,115 72 From repayment of interest by Pacific railway companies 810.833 80 From sinking fond for Pacific railway companies 805,180 54 From custom fees, fines, penal tie#,etc '. 1,222.514 86 From fees on consular letter pat ents and lands 22,244,984 99 From proceeds of sales of gov ernment property 262,174 00 From profits on coiuage 3,468,485 61 From revenues of the District of Columbia 2,016,199 23 From miscellaneous sources 6.268,801 34 Total ordinary receipts $360,782,297 00 Tbe ordinary expenditures for tbe same period were: For civil expenses For foreign intercourse. For Indians For prisoners For the military establishment, including river and harbor im provement and arsenals For the naval establishment, in cluding vessels and machinery in improvement at the navy yards .-. For miscellaneous expenditures, includins public buildings, light house, and collecting the rev enue For expenditures on account or the District of Columbia For interest on tbe public debt.. For premium on bo^ds purchased SILVER. In pursuance of the policy of the govern ment to maintain silver at or near the gold standard it was made receivable for all cus toms, taxes and public dues. About $00, 000,000 of standard silver dollars are now outstanding. They formed an unnecessary addition to the paper onrrency, as the current amount which may readily be supplied by the national banks is shown to be sufficient In ac cordance with the act of February 28, 1878, tbe treasmy department has monthly caused at least $2,000,000 in value of silver bullion to be coined into standard dollars. One hundred and two millions of these dollars have been already coined, while only about $34, 000,000 are in circulation. For tbe reasons which he specifies, I concur in the secretary's recommendation that the provision for coinage of the specified amount each month bo re pealed, and that hereafter only so much be coined as shall bo necessary to supply the de mand. GOLD CERTIFICATES. The socretary advises tbat the issue of gold certificates should not for the present be re sumed and suggests that the national banks may be properly forbidden by law to retire their cur rency, except on reasonable notice of their in tention to do so. Such legislation wonld seem to be justified by tbe reconstruction of certain bankB on the occasion referred to, in the secretary's report. Of the $15,000,000 of fractional 'currency still outstand ing only about $80,000 bas been ledeemed the past year. The suggestion? that this amount may properly be dropped from future statements of the publio debt seems worthy of approval. So also does tbe sugges tion of the secretary as to tbe advisability, of relieving the calendar of the united'Statee courts in tbe southern district of New York by the transfer to another tribunal of the numer ous suits there pending against collectors. THE 

REVENUE from customs for the past fiscal year was $198,159,676.02 an Increase of $11,637, 611.42 over that of the preceding year $138,098,562.39 of this amonnt was col lected at the port of New York, leaving S50, 251,523.63 as the amount collected at all tbe other ports of tbe country. Of this sum $47,977,137.63 was coUeoted on sugar and molasses, 3»7,285,624.78 on wool and manu factures, $2,462,534.34 on. iron and steel and manufactures thereof, $19,038,665.81 on manufactures ot silk, $10,825,115.21 on manufactures of cotton, $6,469, 643.04 on wines and spirits, making the total revenue from these sources $133,058,720.81. The expenses of collec tion for the past year have been $6,419,345.20, an increase over the preceding year of $387, 410.04. Notwithstanding the increase rev-a tone from customs over the previous year the gross value of tbe imports, ineluding free goods decreased over $25,000,000. Tbe marked decrease was in tbe valne of unmanu factured wool $14,023,682. and in that of scrap and pig iron $12,810,671.' The valne of imports on Bngar, on the other hand, showed an increase of $7,457,474, of steel rails $4, 345,521, of bar iron K2,154,204, and of steel in bars, eta* $620,046. Compared with the previous Vsar, there was an inorease of merchandise ana a decrease of $06,738,688 in the value of imports. The WDMl average inerease of Imports of mer-1 jrc^ vr* chandise over exports thereof, for ten years previous to June 30, 1873, wss $1,488,922, but for theiast'six years there bas been an ex cises of exports ever imports of merchandise of $1,180,668,103, an annual aver age of $196,778,017. The specie value of' the exports of domestic merchandise waft $376,616,473 in 1870 and $883,925,947 in 1881, an increase of $307, 309,474, or 135 per cent The value of im ports was $435,958,408 in 1870 and $642, 664,628 in 1881, an increase of $206,706, 220, or 47 per cent during each year. From 1862 to 1879, inclusive, the exports ot specie exceeded the imports. The largest ex cess of such exports over imports was reached during the year 1864, when it amounted to $92,204,929, but during the year ending Jnne 30, 1880, the imports of coin and bull ion exceeded the exportB by $75,891,391, and during the last fiscal year the excess of im ports over exports was $91,168,650. REFUNDING. In the last annual report of the secretary of tbe treasury the attentidh of congress was called to the fact that $469,651,050 in 5 per cen tum bonds and $203,573,750 in 6 per centum bonds were to become redeemable during the year, and congress was asked to authorize tbe refunding of these bonds at a lower rate of in terest The bill for such refunding having failed to become a law, the secretary of tbe treasury in April last notified the holders of tbe $195,690,400 6 per cent bonds then out standing, that the bonds would be paid at par on tbe first day of July follow ing, or that they might be continued at tbe pleasure of the government, to bear in terest at the rate of 3^ per centum per an num. Under this notice $175,055,150 of the 6 per centnm bonds- were continued at the lower rate, and $17,632,250 {redeemed. In the month of May alike .notice was given re specting the redemption or continuance of tbe $439,841,350of percent b^nds tben out standing of these $401,504,900 were con tinued at 3*2 per centum per annum, and $38, 336,450 redeemed. The 6 per cent bonds of the loan of February 8, 1861 and of tbe Oregon war debt amounting together to $14, 121,500 having matured during the year the secretary of the treasury gave notice of his in tention to redeem the same and such as have peen presented have been paid from the sur plus revenue. There have been also redeemed at par $16,179,100 of the 3*2 per centum continued bonds, m%kjng a total o'f bonds re deemed or which have ceased to bear interest during the year of $123,069,650. THE PUBLIC DEBT. The reduction of the annual interest on the public debt through these transactions is ab follows: Bv reduction or interest to 3*2 per cent $10,473,952 27 By redemption of bonds 6,352,340 00 Total $16,826,292 27 The 3*2 Per centum bonds being payable at the pleasure of the government are available for investment of surplus revenue without the pavment of premiums. Unless these bonds can be funded at a much lower rate of interest that they now bear, I agree with the secretary of the treasury that no legislation respecting them is desirable. REDUCTION OF REVENUE. It is a matter for congratulation that the busi ness of the country has Deen so prosperous dur ing the past year as to yield by taxanon a large surplus of iucome to the government If the revenue laws remain unchanged, this surplus must, year by year, increase, on account of the reduction of the public debt and its burden of interest, and because of the Eankersand $17,941,177 19 1.093,954 92 6.514,161 09 5,005,027 96 40,466,460 55 15,686,671 66 41.837.280 57 3.543,912 03 82,508,741 18 1,612.268 78 Total ordinary expenditures.. $260,712,837i#9 19,- Leaving a surplus of revenue of $100,06! 404.98, which was applied as follows: To the redemption of bonds for the sinking fund ....

Tbe sum of $74,480,201 was applied to this fund, which left a deficit of $16,205, 873.47. Tne increase of the revenue for 1881 over that of the previous year was $19, 352,901.10. It is estimated that the receipts during the present fiscal year will reach $400, 000,000, and expenditures $270,000,000, leaving a surplus of $130,000,000. rapid increase of our population. In 1860, just prior to the in stitution of our internal revenue system, our population but slightly exceeded 30, 000,000. By the census of 1880 i is now found to exceed 50,000,000. It is estimated that even if tbe annual receipts and expenditures should continue as at present, the entire debt could be paid in ten years. In view, however, of the beavy load of taxation which our people have already borne, we may well consider whether it is not the part of wis dom to reduce the revenues, even if we delay a lictle the payment of the debt It seems to me that the time has arrived when the people may justly demand some relief from their present enormous burden and that by Sue economy in the various branches of the public service this may readily be afforded. 1 therefore concur with the sec retary in recommending the abolition of all in ternal revenue taxes except those upon tobac coin its various forms, and upon distilled spirits and fermented liquors, and except also the special tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles. Tbe retention of the latter tax is desirable as affording the officers of the government a proper supervision of these articles for the prevention of frauds. I agree with the secretary of the treasury that the law imposing a stamp tax on matches, proprietary articles, playing cards and drafts may with propriety ba re- ealed, the law also by which banks and are assessed upon their capital and deposits. There seems to be a general sonti ment infavor of this course, and in tbe present condition of our revenues the tax upon deposits is especially unjust.- It was "never imposed ia this country until it was demanded by tbe necessities of war, and never exacted, I be lieve, ia any other country even in its greatest exigencies. Bankers are required to secure their circulation by pledging, with the treasurer of the United States, bonds of Ihe general government The interest on these bonds, which at tbe time was 6 per cent, is now in most instances 3*2 per cent, and besides, tbe entire circulation was originally limited by law, and no increaso was allowable when the existing banks had practically a monopoly of the business. There was the suggestion that for the franchise to the favoring grantees the government might -very properly exact a tax on circulation. But for years the system has been free and tbe amount of circulation regulated by the publia demand. The retention of this tax has been suggested as a means of reimbursing the gov ernment for the expense of printing and fur nishing the circulating notes. If the tax should be repealed, it would certainly seem proper to require the national banks to pay tbe amount of such expense to the controller of the cur rency. TAX ON 

LIQUOR AND TOBACCO. It is perhaps doubtful whether the imme diate reduction of the scale of taxation upon liquors aud tobacco is advisable, especially in view of tbe drain upon the treasury, which must attend the payment of arrears of pen sions. A comparison, However, or tne amount of taxes collected under the varying rates of taxation wbicb have at different times prevailed, suggests the intimation that some reduction may soon be made without crippling the revenue. TARIFF REVISION. The tariff laws also need revising, but that a due regard may be paid to the conflicting in terosts of our citizens, important changes should be made with caution. If a careful re vision cannot be made at this session a commis sion such asw as lrftelv approved by the sen ate and is now recommended by the secretary of the treasury would doubtless lighten the la bors of cougress whenever the subject shall be brought to its consideration. ARMY AND NAVY. •THE WAR DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the secretary of war will make known the operations of that department for the past year. He suggests measures for promoting the efficiency of the army by adding to tbo number of officers, and recommends the legislation necessary to in crease the number of enlisted men to 30,000, to tho maximum al lowed by law. This he deems necessary to preserve the peace aud suppress disorders ana marauding in new settlements, to protect settlers and thoir property against Indians, against the encroachments of intruders and to enable immigrants to establish homes in the most remote parts of our country. The army is now necessarily scattered over such a vast extent of territory that whenever an outbreak occurs reinforcements must be hurried ''from many quarters over a great distance and at heavy cost for transportation of men, horses, wagons and supplies. I concur in the recommendations of the secretary for increasing the army to the strength of 30,000 enlisted men. It appears .by the^secretary's report"that In the absence of disturbances on tbe frontier the troops have been actively employed in collecting Indians hitherto hostile and locating them on their proper reservations tbat Sitting Bull and his adherents are now prisoners at Fort Randall that the Utos have been moved to their reser vation in Utah. During the recent OUTBREAK OF TBE APACHES it was necessarj to reinforce the garrisons in Arizona by troops withdrawn from New Mexico. Some Apaches are now held prison ers for trial, while some have escaped, andthe majority of the tribe are now on the reserva tion. There is need of legislation to prevent intrusion upon the lands set apart for the In dians. A large military force at great expense is now required to patrol the boundary line between Kansas and the Indian Territory. The only punishment that can at present be inflicted is the forcible romoval of the intruder and the imposition of a pecuniary fine. which in most cases it is impossible to collect There should be a penalty by imprisonment in such cases. The separate organization of the sig nal service is urged by the secretary of war, and a full statement of tbe advantages of such permanent organization is presented in the re port of the chief signal officer. A de tail of the nsnal Vork performed by the signal corps and the weather bureau is also given in that report Iask attention to the statement of the secretary of war regarding the requisitions frequently made by the Indian bureau upon the subsistence department of tho army, for ths casual support of bands or tribes of In dians for which appropriations are exhausted. The war department should not be left br tea son of inadequate provisions for the Indian bureau to oontribute for the .main- 7 tananoe of the Indiana.
