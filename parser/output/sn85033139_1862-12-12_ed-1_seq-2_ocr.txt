We do not make tins aunmii.ceuie' t on the strength oi tlie speech of Fernando Wood Hi New ’lurk a few days ag ) though Mr. U oo*l -poke positively and distinctly ol .-udi jim pioposUioiis having been made V\ e m -.ke it on the strength id inlormatinii dr red, explicit, and which we ourselves know to be per felly reliable (Jl the precise terms ot the proposition "e ale not at libcity lo speak, but they a;e such as the poihli could honorably make and the north could honorably ac cept 1 hey are such as, made the basis ot settlement, would icsioie lire old Union. b.nce the ailm;nis, radon became p* s-e.-s --ed ot these proposition* Congress have as senibled and tlie President ha- snbmnte 1 ins annual message. No mention is made in iho message of any knowledge by the President ot any n**w avenue bv which peace is possible, ihe whole In potlresis ot the message is that peace and settle merit are attainable oniv bv continuance <d ihe war and the enforcement of the uuiver.-al emaucipad.iii scheme. Looking at the message alone, the inference i irresistible that the administration have contemptuously rejected the overtures from tl*e south, and that their demand is still fur blood. If it so he that tlie adrninstralion have determined to withhold from the c'untn ali information concerning the wol i igue-? ut the south ;<> ssop> the war and return to the L mon on j j-i and houoraf 1c terms, that infor itiartoii must lie communicated to the country in some oilier wav.

We give up a large portion of this week’s Pilot to the Message of President Lincoln not for anything wise, benefi cial, or patriotic that it contains, but to show our readers how the President is troubled with “nigger on the Drain.” The message commence? with “ nigger,” and ends wiifT**‘ nigger,”—not a word for the benefit of the w hite people of the country, who a;e now loaded down with heavy tax es and a worthless currency, and a fair prospect of a divided and ruined nation. In the language of the New Votk Express —“The leading, principal, cardinal topic ’n the Message, is the " Negro,”—a word carefully suppressed in the federal Consli tnt'.on, but a? carefully elaborated upon by Mr. Lincoln. W hat the Fathers of the Constitution hesitated to touch, Mr. Lincoln Lurie? himself in, all over. The great and pervadb g defect of the Message, is the imaginary idea of the President— that this federal government was created to da about everything, instead of little or nothing and that the chiefest abject of its crcatian was to fee negroes, lienee, the I’roiilent devotes half of his Message to this great idea—never, tlie business of tiik Nation ; but ever, before lie and his came into power, the business, when the business of an} body, of the State. “ What Catholicism, Roman, or Epis copal.— what Methodism or Baptism,— what Uoivetsalisnl, or Unitananism, — what Judaism, or Mahotnedanism, are to our Constitution, —so the negro ought to he, and was under the dogmas of \\ ash inoton and Fuanklin, —all subjects for differences of opinion, and for toleration ihe tine theory of our government is ?Hat, as a man can have any religion lie pleases, or none—so in the State-, what the men of ihe Sta'es decide on, they can have, in social, or socialistic organization —negroes as slaves, or negroes as voters negroes in amalgamation, or negroes tabooed as in Illinois. One State ha? nothing to do with the social organization of another. If in Maine they choose lo live on ice water, that is no reason why the hof, muddy Mississippi shall not be drawn in Louisiana, Arkansas or Mis ouii. if in Massachusetts they choose to let the women vote, that would te no cause for disunion in South Carolina, If in Califor nia, they give equal suffiage lo the Chi nese, or in Minnesota to the Sioux, that is no cause for rebellion in Vermont.— Our Sunday is the Sit unlay of the Jews, liic Friday of the Mahomedatis—but that i? no reason why we, Christian?, should have a civil war, it there were among us, a w hole Stale of Jew?, or Mahornedans.— Fire Sunday of New O; leans is a horror to Boston, and he Sunday of Boilon is a horror to New Orleans— but that, is no reason why the two cities should fight.— '*ur Fathers alttempted to create a Gov eminent of great toleration for ail soils of differences in habits atui customs. — Mr. Lincoln is attempting to amalgamate all climates, all habits, as well as these dif ferent social organization®, lo confound latitude and longitude —the ice and the orange, the banana and the potato, the negro and the white man, of course must fail. Ihe longer he persists in it, the longer the civil war must last—for he is attempting *o overthrow nature, and tlie laws ol God, as well as man.” Ocit Public Debt. —Secretarv*Cu aseT report, recently made to Congress, esti mate-. the public debt, on the Ist of July m-x, at One pillion nod Fifty Millions of Dollars. A nice little account to run up I by an Adrninist radon one of the planks of who-e platform is a rigid economy in gov eminent*! expenditures ! 1 i Innocent Men Imi'hisoned Five c iti z* ns of Washington, have filed affidavits before Judge Advocate Tcrneh, stating that they had been arrested by defective* acting under orders from the War 1 e -parlment, on trivial charges, RO d released from irnpr or rr><>nf or par jug fjr, fo $ JOO A most Inhuman Act. A few weeks since we gave an account of the shooting, in colJ blood, of ten .citi zens of Missouri, by order of one Gen. Me Neil, an officer who dKgraces the Union array. These m*n were murdered on the sole ground that a Union citizen of the vi cinity had been missing for several days, and could not be found. There wa no ev idence whatever that the man was foully dealt with, and if *o, that cither of those en poor human beings hail anv hand in it. It was enough for this devil in human form, with shou’der straps, to judge them •‘guilty ” without trial of any kind, and have them shot—one by one—in the pres ence of their w ives and children. The Cos lambus (Ohio) Crisis has the following se quel to the horrible affair : “Tk man for whom General McNeil shot ten some time ago, and which was noticed in the Crisis . has returned home alive and well, and his wife, before the ex ecution of those men, went to him (Gene ral McNeil) and pleaded with him to wait and see it he had been killed before he ex edited those m*n. and the brute spurned her. I can write no more” As yet the government has made no sign as to what it will do in the case of Gen. McNeil. The return of the missing man alive and well reallv neither adds to nor takes from the atrocity of the murder of the ten men, but it brings the matter home to the dullest and most prejudiced comprehension. Ihe St. Joseph (Mo.) Journal savs that this wholesale murderer of innocent men met with several merited rebuffs at St Louis lately, lie approached Gen. Me- Kinstcy and offered his hand. The Gen eral said to him, I don’t shake hands [with a murderer” McNeil afterwards j asked three gentlemen to drink with him ;in the Planters’ House saloon. They turn led on their heels and said, ‘ We don’t | drink with a murderer.” This was tl pre j caption he met with almost everywhere he I went in St. Louis, and no doubt tlie ghosts {of the murdered men haunted him by dav i and by night. “ The way of the trans ! grosser is hard.” Improvements —Notwithstanding the dullness in business caused bv tlie war, in j olher towns, we bave bad several substan i tial btrihiings erected in Manitowoc during j the past season. We will particularly mention the hand |-ome store erected by onr enterprising i fellow-ci'izen. Mr O. Torhipon, near the north end of the bridge. At a heavy out lay of money he has erected a splendid building, which, for size and desbrn, can hardly be excelled in this or any other western town. Its dimensions are very large, and it is handsomely finished and ornamented inside. The j aiming and graining of its interior departments is ot the best artistic skill, and the store, in a!' its accomodations and conveniences to purchasers, is all that could he a*k'd. Mr. Tourison is one of our live mer chants, w ho, by honest and fair dealing, ha? won an enviable reputation among our bu-iness men. 13y liberality to his customers, and business qualifications, he lias succeeded in aliening a position sec ond to no other merchant in Northern Wis tonsin, and we hope he will continue to increase hrs aheady heavy business. — He is now moving bis stock of goods from in? old place of business to his new store, and will be happy to see his old custom ets and many new ones at his new estab lishment. Loyalty.— The Abolition fanatics have been in the habit of calling eve r y man dis loyal who would not agree with them in the manner of conducting tire war. J lie Philadelphia Catholic snubs these crea ture? as follows : “ Loyally here and now means devotion to the Union, the Constitution, and the le- Ultimate government of ihe United States. It does not mean the adoption of any pe culiar theory as to the shortest way of pul ling down the rebellion. To call a man disloyal ora traitor because bis sober son-e disapproves of your bobby on the right way ot ending tlie war, is simply to prove yourself a narrow-minded, persecution loving fanatic.” Marine Losses for November. —The table of marine losses in the Atlantic ocean for the past month shows a loss in the aggregate of fifty one vessels, of which eight were ships, four were bark®, seven were brigs, twenty three were schooners, one a steam lug, and one a sloop Of this number seven were cap'ured by the rebel steamer Alabama, and burned ; four sunk after collision ; eight were abandon ed ; three are missing, and one was hurri ed. The total value of the property lost, destroyed, and missing, is one million four hundred and sixty three thousand five hundred dollars. A Kkw German Regiment. —lt is stat el that Gov, Salomon intends to organize a new German regiment from the drafted men. and give 'he command to Col. Fritz Annexe, who formerly had charge of the batteries raised in this State while in camp at Racine. Rebels Forufting A letter from Fortress Monroe, under date of the 3d, say that Petersburg, and along the route between there and Richmond is being for tified, by digging rifle pits and throwing up strong earthworks. Large Torres are at wo*k upon ih*rn dar and nighf. Meagher’s Irish Brigade. Gen. Thomas F. Meagher's Irish Brig ade is now the advance force of Burnside's arntv. Much dissatisfaction was express ed by its officers on the removal of Gen. McClellan from command —so much so that several of them immediately tendered their resignations. So many lesignatioi.s were handed in that Gen. Meagher was compelled to decline receiving them, and issued an address on the subject, in which occurs tiie fulilowing language : “ These resignations, the Brigadier Gen eral has reason to believe, were f**r the most part prompted by the recall of Major General McClellan from the command of the Annv of the Potomac. Unless ho misunderstands them they were intended hs a signal expression of devotion to that trusted and beloved \< utig general. But devotion to a general, however popular and richly endowed with talents, and bv nature magically qualified to atracl and bind soldiers to him, ought not 1 e allow ed to interrupt f>r a moment the lova! and intimate relations which should ever unite the soldier to Ins flag and the citizen to the Stale.” The residence of Daniel Devlin, Esq. at Manhattanville, near New Yoik, was the scene of a veiy interesting ceremony a few days since, which was witnessed bv a large company of ladies and genii emen including Archbishop Hughes, August Belmont, James Brady, Dr. Ives, Judges Daly and Hilton, and Sheppard Knapp. The ceremony was the presen tation of anew and superb set of colors to brigade, and the transfer of their old and battle-torn colors to the tempo rary custody of Mr. Devlin, an old and hard-working friend of the brigade.—- Brief and felicitous speeches were made by one of tiie officers of the brigade, Capt. McGee, deputed to return the old colors, ami by Mr. Devlin, to whose care they' were consigned, and by Mr. Spalding in presenting and a gallant officer in receiv ing the new colors. Ihe old flags are a touching memorial of the services which the Dish Brigade has rendered to tho country. 1 hey are stained with winds and rain, torn imo tatters, pierced with bullet and shell spl nter-, ami stained with noble biood Ihe new ones tire exceed ingly beautiful in color and design. Tho names of the various b uile-fieUis in which ! the biijjade lias won its unfad ng laurels are inscribed upon their folds, ami the new fields in which they wii renew their old victories will alas! be recorded as they have been in the flags now preserved iu | llieir honor.

The President, too, is reported as having lately made the remark that the army is less in numbers to day than when the last levy was made for three hundred thousand men ! Die Size of ant Army.— Secretary Stanton, in his annual report, makes the statement that, there are now ten military departments; and the armies operating in those departments, according to official re turns, constitute a force of seven hundred and seventy-five thousand three hundred and thirty six men ; that since the date of the returns, this number has been increas ed to over eight hundred thousand, and when the quotas are filled up, will amount to over one million of men. - our’.to n News. — The latest arrival born Europe brings advices that the news of the removal of McClellan caused a de pression in American securities, and was generally regarded by the English press n.a a political move made in consequence of the Democratic victories in several stales.
