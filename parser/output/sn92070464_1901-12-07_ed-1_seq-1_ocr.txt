If ever anarchy Is triumphant. It triumph will last for Imt one red moment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy niirht of dtspotlsm. For the nnorchlst himself, whether he preach s or practices h's doctrines, we nerd uot hnve one particle more concern than tnr any ordinary murder er. He la not the vtctlti of Metial or noinieai injimimw tmn are no wrontx to remedy !n his raae.

They and those like them should be kept out of this country: nu if found here they should he prnmpily deported to the country from whence they came, nnd fur reaching p ovlslon should be made for the punishment of thoae who stay. No matter "alls more urgently for the wUeat thought of congreaa The federal courts should be given Jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill a president or any man who by the constitution or by law Is In line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be pro nortioncd to the cuo'tnlty of the of fenae againat our Institutions. Anarchy la n crime ngaluat the whole human rneo; and all mankind should band against the anarchist. Ills crime should be made an offense againat the law of nations like plrac and that form of man stealing known aa Ihe xlave trade: for It la of far blacker Infamy than either. It shuuld be ao declared by treaties among all civilised lowers. Such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dialing with the crime A grim coinmentaiy upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the attitude or the Inw toward this very criminal who had Juat taken the lire of the president The people would have torn Mm limb from limb If It had not been that the law he defied waa at once Invoked In his behalf. 8i far from hla deed being committed on be half or the people n gainst the govern eminent, the government was obliged at once to nxert Ita full poller Kwer to save Mm from instant death at the handH of the xoplc Mon-over his died worked not the slightest dlntora (Ion ill oiir governmental system and the ilailit' i of tin- H nrrenee of sttell iIiciIh mi inattei how great It might

He favors the couaervntlve control of the Imge corporations of the country, on this subject lie anya "There Is a widespread conviction n the minda nf the American people hat the great corporations known aa mats are tn certain of their features and tendencies hur.ful to the general welfare. This springs from no spirit or envy or unchaiitableneas, nor lack or pride in the great Industrial ach'evementa that have placed thla conntrv at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy- It does iiot rest upon a mck of intelll gent appreciation or the necessity or meetins clianalna am changed condl-l tlonn or titde with new methods, nor upon Ignorance or the fact that com bination nf capital In the effort to ac- compiled g.ent things la neceeeary when 'be worlds nroereas deraanda that great things lie lime.

"Wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawn! of forest io- sources, whether or wood, water or grass, fro-n contributing their full share to be welfare or the penplo, but. on the contrniy, gives the nmiur aiice or larger and more certnln aup- plles.
