The Hetch-Hetchy bill enables .San I'ranelsco not only to acquire valu able water rights which will allow the i.ity to add materially to it.s water .supply, but aNo power rights which v.lth the beginning of municipally owned street car lines now being built, will have nn Important bearing on the municipal ownership .situation there. This is doubtless the reason that the Jletch-IIetchy bill has been fought to bitterly. Paid bureaus of "information" have ent out reams of matter over the country as to why congress should refuse Fan Francis co's request to take over this land. Home newspapers have been misled Into advocating such a refusal on the basis or acn "information." Or else they have followed their own inclina ation In opposing matters in which the public interest is concerned and private interests threatened. The worst thing the power trust pres3 bureau did in this connection, however, and It seemed for a while that thi3 maneuver might be success ful where others failed, was to plead that the ncenic beauty of Yosemlte all-?y would be destroyed by this grant to the city. Naturalists, even men of such note as John IVfdir were persuaded that the matter of scenic beauty was so important that the grant should be turned down. Other good men and women over the country were enlisted aga!nst the grant in the same way. Now the real facts seem to be that the actual detrimental effect on the Yosemlte valley "scenery is almost negligible, while the grant will give' the people of San Frincisco a good foothold for continuing their light against the tyranny of the city's trac tion and power Interests, which be came nationally notorious in the time of ex-Mayor Schmitz and "Abe" ltcuf. In position to extend their usefulness. The things of most Importance to be considered are keeping pupils In school beyond the lower grades, giv ing them practical Instruction and training and making It possible for working girls and boys to avail them selves of school privileges. These are as much entitled to rudimentary edu cation as the more fortunate child ren who are not obliged by circum stances to enter the ranks of bread winners. The ideal plan for the conduct of public schools is yet to be devised or produced through .an evolutionary process, but every advance made, every improvement added brings them nearer to the goal. GIVK l.S A FAIH CHANCK. We are not so blind to the advant ages of .South Bend as a location for th Grand Trunk railway shops as to concede that any other city on the line between Chicago and the Canadi an border is in the comparison. It seems inevitable that If the rail way company's best Interests, includ ing its convenience, is considered, the hop3 will be located either here or at Mishawaka. Against South IJend, pre judice 13 the only thing that can have serious weight with the railroad com pany, and that is purely a speculative quantity. If prejudice on account of the Di vision st. matter Is to havea weight in deciding the matter it should find an ameliorating circumstance in what outh Bend and some of Its citizens have done Indirectly for the Grand Trunk company. It was a Eolith Bend man, the late Judge Thomas S. .'tan field, who made it possible for the Grand Trunk to have Its present di rect and advantageous lines from De troit and Port Huron to Chicago. The story of Judgo Stanfield's ser vices In, organizing an Indiana com pany and assisting the old Peninsular Bairoad company In securing Its right of way through this state was recently told by The News-Times. It was a story of opportune aid rendered at a A 

I'KIISOXAL RESPONSIBILITY. It was buzzed around on Saturday that Mayor-elect Keller would today make public his appointments. With out the slightest desire to hurry him we hope he will. Not being among the wise) ones who have figured out the slate in advance we are consumed with curiosity. And when we know, It will be a fas cinating pastime to analyze the dope by which our next mayor reached his conclusions. With the abundance of material provided by three or more political parties to choose from and with an eye to the eternal harmonies It must have been some Job. The News-Times has considerately refrained from burdening Mr. Keller with recommendations or reminding him more or less obviously of his in debtedness to certain alleged contribu tory causes. The election, put the se lection of his cabinet up to Mr. Keller and The News-Times was content to leave It there without exerting other influence than that which may have been found in a legitimate reproduc tion of current expressions of public opinion and sentiment. Inevitably more or less information concerning Mr. Keller's Investigations has leaked out and it la known that some good material for official posi tions has been included In his consid erations, and from this it may be as sumed that he has tried to associate efficient men with him in his coming administration of city affairs. Mr. Keller, if he has completed his list may not have succeeded as well as he would have liked in securing for the various positions at his command the men best fitted to perform their duties. If ho it will be his misfortune as well as the city's, so far as it proves to be a misfortune. not an unmixed evil. The state needs the moisture. We. may not pet the Grand Trunk shops, but the Grand Trunk will know we are after them. Pres. Wilson's railroad plan for Alaska, if successful, will form a. fac tor in future governmental relations to railroad problems. Government ownership of transportation lines is one of the problems we must sooner or later thresh out. A musical event of extraordinary interest will be the first concert of the Ingersoll symphony orchestra, an al most purely local organization which promises to give South Bend a more prominent position in the musical world.

Miss Couzins lacked the essential quality of consistency. BY nti:i) C. KFLLY. WASHINGTON. Frank Buchanan, one of the Illinois representatives, was international president of the BriJge and structural Iron Workers union at the time of the hie strike back in 1901' or thereabouts. Byron It. Newton, a reporter for the New York Herald, was covering the New York phase of the strike for his paper and had to call on Buchanan nearly every day for news. One after noon Buchanan said to Newton: "If you'll drop In about this time to morrow I may be able to give you a good inside tip, provided you don't use it as coming from me. I'll know then whether the strike can be set tled." Newton called as requested, but Bu chanan had left town unexpectedly, and NewH did not see him again until a few days ago when Buchanan hap pened to drop into his olhce. You see, each had risen in life since the time of the strike; Buchanan to con gress and Newton to his present Job as assistant secretary , of the treasury. ! Buchanan did not recognize New-' ton, but Newton knew Buchanan right oil. "Well." said Newton, looking up calmly from his desk, "you've been a long time coming across with that tip about the strike." alis vj:ll. "All is well" the word is said By the blind men to the blind. And the Tory nods hi head Quite contented in his mind: "All is well" men starve and die In the midst of plenty's store. Babies weep and motbers cry, Famine lingers at the door. Children toil In roaring mills. . . Bobbed of all their hours of play. Doing work that stunts and kills "All is well." the Tories cry. Women take the wage of shame. Driven by the scourge of want: Ftlll the slogan is the same, "All Is well," resounds the vaunt. Law Is trampled under foot. Bight is sunken In the mire And the thug, the vicious brute. Beat and slug and killfor hire. Men who dare to speak the truth Pace within a prison cell; Power rules that knows no ruth. Yet men murmur, "All is well!" Fetid street and filthy slum Toll that makes men's lives a hell. Want and woe and vice and rum Let's bo thankful "AH is well!" 

BEBTON BBALEY. I sc 5C THE MELTING POT) COME1 TAKE POTTCCX Willi US. J The recent wedding of the presi dent's daughter recalls the case of Charlie Hand. Charlie was a talented little Knglish Journalist and was sent over here by one r fche leading London daily papers to write the account of Alice Itoose velt's marriage to Nick Longworth. AVhen a king's daughter gets married. It Is, of course, the big stuff over there, and the paper took the marriage of a president's daughter with almost equal seriousness. They were not con tent with getting the accounts cabled by any of the press associations, but wanted their own exclusive story the next morning by their own man on the Job. Ho they placed him on a boat, bade him attend the wedding and then rush to the nearest cable station. "When he arrived in Washington, ITnd made a rather startling discov ery, to wit: The wedding was on Saturday and his paper had no Sunday edition. Michael Donohoe, one of the Phila delphia congressmen, went back to visit his old home in Ireland not long ago. It was his first time back since he was honored by a seat in congress, and e made it a point to comment on his achievements to one of his old schoolmasters'. "You probably haven't -heard that I'm now a member of congress," sug gested Donohoe. The old man just stared at some thing eight or ten miles away and said nothing. "You know in the United States it is considered a great honor to be sent to congress," went on Donohoe. The old man gave an almost Inaud ible little grunt. "Congress, you understand," pur sued Donohoe, "is the national law making body. The other branches of the government are the administra tive and Judicial and the three are co ordinated." "Uh-hu " murmured Donohoe's former teacher. "And," continued Donohoe, "the law-making branch is divided into two houses. I am a member of what is known as the house of representa tives. I have been elected to a sec ond term, too." Tho old man cleared his throat at last and spoke. "Michael," he said, "I always did feel sure that vou'd eventually be sent SOM E WH K B E. Suppose you wer. a poor ignorant mother and your baby was sick and suffering for proper food and intelli gent Oare, how would you feel to ward the Children's dispensary? Former Sen. Joe Bailey built him self a fine big house on one of the best residence streets in Washington and moved into it shortly before he re signed from the? senate. Tho place must have cost somewhere between $30,000 and $50,000. .Some persons with a big house to pay for might have hesitated about giving up a reg ular salarv from the government. But Bailey didn't seem worry about it any at all. He seemed to think he could find work. A few weeks ago Bailey came out of the United States supreme court room, where he had been arguing an important case, and met a friend in the corridor. "Well, how're you making out?" inquired the friend. "Oh. in't complain," replied Bailey. "I think I paid for my house this af ternoon." Which, considering what a tidy little place the house is. wasn't a bad after noon. Ballev used to keep telling the folks back in Gainesville. Texas, how he was looking forward to dropping out of politics and returning there to his law practice and old friends.. He still has his little home there and a law otnee. Both are locked up awaiting his return. But the chances are that It may be a long wait. What would be the fun of a man leaving the supreme court chamber, where the big fees are pulled down, and going back to Gainesville to open un a little old law office and try cases involving the location of line fences and drainage ditches? WE are taking with a grain of salt tho statement circulating in tho news papers that one out of every 54 peo ple in the stato of Indiana owns an automobile. By actual count 5 4 peo ple, we know. Including ourself, own automobiles, with one exception. THE Joplin policeman who told a woman wearing a slit skirt to go home and get some clothes on may have been right under the antiquated Mis souri laws covering public decency, but the law should hesitate to under take keeping up with fads and fancies in feminine attire. The policeman, who lost his job on a charge of im pertinence, was simply a victim of circumstances.

(North Judson News.) Paper money amounting to $230, which Thomas Small, a farmer, living at Rich Valley, Ind., had placed in his shoe, had disappeared when he reached Wabash and opened his shoe to pay for a purchase in a Wabash store. Mr. Small had placed the mon ey in his shoe before leaving home and had not missed it until he opened his shoe to pay the clerk. OUR besetting Inadvertence is changing clothes without transferring out latchkey. What is yours? Wonder How They Traced Him. (Sassopolls Vigilant.) Twelve skunk hides were stolen re cently from the barn of Mark Oppen helm, the Dowagiac produce and fur buyer, and Fred Dean Northrup, of Laporte, a young man residing near that city, is in jail and has confessed to the stealing. The officers suspected the young man and traced his move ments.

Mrs. Lewis Halderman, of Iarwill, who is one of the best informed la dies in the county, believes that the recent message of President Wilson is the finest one she has ever read, and she has read them all since the time of President Buchanan. AT this season of the year it hap pens that the weather and a man's bills aro in the same condition. BegH to He ma in Far Away. (North Liberty News.)

So far as can be learned the only living white man who had explored all the books of Dr. Eliot's Harvard clas sics before they became celebrated as the Ave foot shelf, was Sen. O'Gorman. From early boyhood O'Gorman has spent-his substance for books, and even year his notion of the life ideal is to be the proprietor of some nice, dingy little second-hand book store. Dong before he was of age he had read scores of books that the rest of his associates could not even pro nounce the names of. When Eliot's five-foot shelf came out some time ago. O'Gorman got the list and check ed them over. He had read every one back In the days when most young men of his years were still reading Alger stories. (Copyright. 19 n. by Fred C. Kelly.
