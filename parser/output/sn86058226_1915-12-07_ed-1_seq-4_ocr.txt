'If ?f.1 President Wilson's Message President Wijson. today presented the most forceful message he has asked the American con gress to consider. The document centered about the preparedness program and the chief execu tive endorsed the plans made public by Secretary Garrison and Secretary Daniels. He asked for more men and ships, and asked congress to pass laws making effective the plans outlined by the secretary of the army and the secretary of the navy. The American people have been aroused to the weakness of the army and the navy and to the need of military and naval preparedness. President Wilson's plea for legislation, to bring about adequate defenses to repel invasion echoes the sentiment of the American people as a . whole. Europe's great war has thrust upon the Ameri- can people the awful truth that our boundaries are open to invasion at many points and that our army and navy are absolutely inadequate to re pel a designing foe and to protect our country. A bigger army and a bigger navy are needed. Both Democrats and Republicans in the lower house ought unite on the broad basis of patriotism and remove the danger by the enactment of a meas ure sufficiently broad to bring relief. The chief executive voices a patriotic senti ment and one that will appeal to every true American when he denounces in unqualified terms those aliens who have become American citizens;' but still are "preaching and practicing disloyalty", by f participation in plots . against American neutrality. Nefarious dynamiting of munition plants making supplies for foreigners setting fire to plants engaged in the same work and connivance with foreign- agenta in schemes designed to benefit any of the belligerents are in essence; treason against the United ' States. We cannot deny that an alien always' will have sym pathetic interest in the welfare of his. former country, but we insist, with the president, that when a foreigner swears allegiance to the United States he becomes an 'American; and his "whole soul, all his opinions, all, his deeds,, fought 'to 'be American.. Ah American cannot serve two mas- tersV v He must be an American ;-This applies both to British andGeiTOana.. TKe president is right in 3nsis.tingCthat f'such creatures of disloyalty H and anarchjr. must be crushed out'-and the hand of out power should close over them at once." The blowing up of mu nition plants to stop -munition shipments is -re course to anarchy and mob spirit,! The men . de signing these .plots and those conniving at their execution forfeit all rights to be called American citizens. : l'f . ' It cannot .be gainsaid that the European, war has made the problem of national revenue a diffi cult and trying one. Some sort , of plan to re habilitate the finance of the nation is heeded. President Wilson puts this problem squarely -up to Congress, l .The president has little new to say regarding the domestic problems, matters which' he says he will leave to the discretion of congress. - His conclusion is the patriotic - sentiment : ; "For what we are- seeking' how, what in my mind is the single, thought of this message, ; is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation.- We would serve it in the spirit of its peculiar geniusr It is the genius of common men for self government, industry, justice lib erty and peace. We should see to it that it lacks no instrument, no faeilityor vigor of law tomake it sufficient to play its part With energy, safety and assured success. In this We are no parti sans, but heralds and prophets of a new age."
