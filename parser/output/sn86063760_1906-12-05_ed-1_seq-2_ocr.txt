The discharge by Presiden Roosevelt of three negro com oanies of United States troops from the service, for shooting into houses and killing without provocation citizens, is an inci dent that the political-negrc preachers, and Senator Tillman will not allow closed, and they are taking advantage of it to manufacture political capital. In his recent speech at Chicago Senator Tillman criticised the president for summarily dis charging these soldiers without giving them a trial by court nartial, and charged the com mander-in-chief of the army and navy of the Uiited States with transcending his authority as he should not have done, and there by perpetrating an injustice. The political-negro preachers regard the president's action as a reflection on the race, and in urging him to reconsider and modify his order they tacitly threaten the Republican party with withdrawing their support. So far the president remains steadfstby refusing to enter tain the idea of reinstatement o: this band of conspirators whc are banded together by the bonds of secrecy to protect those of their number guilty of inur dering innocent and unmolest ing citizens. The presideni takes the position that the mat ter has been thoronghly investi gated by General Garlington, who by the way, is a South Car olinian, and upon his report and recommendation the order of dismissal was issued and, it must stand unless there is such new evidence as will justify him in reopening the case. 'So it will be seen that threats by vote procurers have no effect nor wil the criticism from Senator Till man swerve the president in his purpose to punish soldiers, white or black. who so far forget the dignity of the uniform as tc "shodt up the town" in which th'ey are stationed. - Now comes the South Carolins Senator after going all over th( country denouncing the negrc and boasting of taking from him his franchise, and advocating the repeal of the fifteen amend m'nt to the constitution, all ol tis for so mnch per speech, ii the press dispatches are true, threatens to further fan the flames of race prejudice by pos ing as the defender of the negro that his rights may be restored, consistency thou art' a jewel. Il Senator Tillman'is sincere in his 'wind-jamming tours for a price, then he mud4~e insincere in ~prosecuting trhe president foz discharging these negro soldiers from the army. and if he carries au hialleged threatto introduce aresolution to inquire into the action of President Roosevelt in the B3rownsville affair it will establish his inconsistency and prove that for self gain, whetber it be money or notoriety he is willing to take any side of a questioni, calculating only which side. will profit him most. The Senator~ proposes to make a * political coup by this scheme of *pretending to appealjfor justice to the negro soldiers. -His pur >pose being, by this move, :to win the negro vote away from the Republican party in the closely contested itates, and in the next national election have them vote the Democratic ticket. This is a statesmanship which .cannot be defended, not even by the most ardent admirer of the Senator, hypocrisy is not to be admired in politics any more than it is in religion, and when -our Representative poses to de fend what -h'e would designate "outrage justice" only to embar ass the opposition party with the hope of winning from it some of its votes, there is no sincerety -about it, neither is their any statesmanship in it, for the rea son that nis scheme does not represent his State, which to a man is ready if the opportunity is given, to endorse the action of President Roosevelt, and a Rep r'esentative taking a position contgiry to the wishes of his people, for no other reason than it will embarass the other side, or in other words "put them in a hole," is petty politics, because the country is not benefitted, the only possible benefit is to office holding politicians. -Suppose President Roosevelt 'exceeded his authority, why shonl'd Tillman step forward to become sponsor for these drunk en negro soldiers who committed murder, and their comrades who are protecting them by refusing to make known the guilty? It does strike us that if any iniquiry is to be made it should come from those who are catering to the negro for his vote and not from a man who is forever preaching all over the country for a money consideration that the negro should have all of his political rights taken away. Any man who boasts of "the shot create the impression that we of the South treat the negro on election day as we would the wild beasts in the swamps, is out of place when denouncing the president for punishing summarily these negro soldiers, and only represents an element whose ideal is successful politics regardless of the country's good. Since the above was written we find that Senator Penrose has taken the wind out of our senior Senator's sails by obtain ing the floor on the opening of Congress, and securing unani mous consent, introduce a reso lution of inquiry into the Presi dent's action. Senator Foraker of Ohio offerred a substitute, and requested that it be read and both his, and the resolution of Senator Per'rose lie over. 

THREATENS TO PROSECUTE THE PRESIDENT. Senator Tillman is determined to stay in the limelight. If re ports in circulation here are correct. in the early days of the session of congress he will create a greater and more startling sensation than any speech he has made or any measure he has introduced during the entire timc he has been a member of the Senate. It is understood here that Sen ator Tillman will introduce a resolution in congress calling for an investigating of President Roosevelt's action in dismissing from the army without honor and without trial by court mar tial three negro companies, some of whose members committed murder at Brownsville, Texas. Senator Tillman has not yet arrived in Washington and it is impossible to verify this rumor, but it is believed that his speech in Chicago indicates that he will take such action. In that speech almost at is conclusion, after he had painted as black as possible the specter of negro domination and after he had given a very low estimate of negro character, Senator Tillman said: 

EXCEEDED HIS POWER. "Now as a general illustration of the injustice that is sometime done, President Roosevelt dis charged three companies of col ored soldiers without court-mar tial, and in doing this he punish ed innocent men for the crime of a few. In doing this he tran cended the authority of the law as he ought not to have done." Representative Garner of Tex. announced yesterday that he would introduce in the house a resolution providing for an in vestigation of the Brownsville affair on the first day of the new session It is believed that the Tillman and Garner resolutions will cause a bigger stir than was created by the South Carolina Senator's resolution for an inquiry into the violent ejectment of Mrs. Morris from the White House. There is great interest manifest ed here in this newest aspect of the Brownsville. affair. WHAtT IS 

TILLMAN AFTER? No part of Tillman's speech has created greater interest than his criticism of President Roose velt for dismissing the negro troops. This criticism was whol ly unexpected and therefore the most interesting feature of his speech. It had been expected that his denunciation of negroes would be unmeasured, but it was wholly a surprise thut he should condemn the president for al leged injustice to negroes. Politicians have searched for a reason for that criticism of the president and some think they have found the answer in the re port Tillman is to introduce a resolution calling for an investi gation of the Brownsville case. A sCHREWD 

MOVE. A Republican politician in dis cussing the report today, said: "If Tiliman does introduce an investigating resolution it will be the smartest thing he has done since he became a Senator. It will put the Republicans in a hole. It will hush Reptiblican criticism of the president and force congressmen and senators of his party to stand by him practically to a man in his action in dismissing the negro troops. Tillman is schrewd enough to see that such will be the effect of introduction by him of a reso lution providing for an inquiry into the Brownsville affair. "The country has taken it for granted that everyT Southern senator and congr assman will endorse the actior. of the presi dent in dismissing the colored soldiers. Their murderous con spiracy was conceived and car ried out in a Southern state and Southerners were the victims. Almost without exception, South ern papers have endorsed the dismissal and with the exception of Tillman practically all South ern public men who have spoken at all have spoken in support of the president's course. 

CREATING A DIVERSION. "Of course, the negroes of the South have condemned the dis missal, for it is a trait of negro character for the race to stand together, even in protecting its members who are in the wrong. The negroes of the North have been equally unanimous and vociferious in their condemna tion. The protests of Southern nogroes would have little effect, as they are practically disfran chised, but the case is different with northern negroes. In close elections they are the balance of power in several states and can determine the result in a number of Northern congressiona] dis tricts. Census figures give the nube of negro votes in states and sometimes by another, a follows: New York, 31,425; New Jer sey,'21,474; Delaware, 8,375; Maryland, 60,406; West Nirginia. 14,785; Ohio, 31,325; indiana, 18,186; Illinois, 29,962: Mis souri, 46,418; Kansas, 14,689. There is every reason to be lieve the next presidential elec tion will be the closest and hardest fought since Cleveland was elected in 1892. The Demo cratic candidate will carry the solid South, of course, and it might be possible for the negro vote to swing into the Demo cratic column some of the-states I have named. "Republicans in congress are not unaware- nor unmindful of this situation, hence the strength of the protests from Northern white men against the presi dent's action. I think it doubt ful if the Republican critics in congress would have proceeded the extreme length of open ac tion to reverse or modify the president's dismissal, but un questionably they would have brought enormous pressure to bear privately to secure some concessions shown in the past that he,. is susceptible . to the argument that he should pay at tention to the arguments of his party's leaders as to what is best to do to serve his party's needs. 

BLOCKED BY TILLMAN. ,'But the astute Tillman will effectively spike the Republican guns and make it political sui cide for the Republican leaders to do anything but make the best of the siutation, if he does introduce the resolution it is said he will propose. Many Re publican senators will agree that the president exceed his author ity in dismissing the .negro troops, but they would not dare to vote for a resolution to that effect introduced by a Southern Democrat, and least of all, when its author is Tillman. His reso lution will also make it imposs ible for them to bring pressure to bear privately upon the presi dent, for if such- pressure were brought and the president should yield to it, the public would re gard it as a victory for Tillman. and it would not modify negro resentmen t against the summary punishment of members of their race by a Republican president. "if Tillman does introduce his resolution, it will effectively squelch all further white Re publicans protest against the dismissal of the negro troops. But, Tillman will realize that he has the Republicans in a hole and will never let escape the op portunity it will give him to make one of his characteristic ally sensational speeches-a speech which will be sure to fill the senate galleries.-W.

PRICE, in Columbia Record A Good Message. President Roosevelt's message to'congress is without doubt an able State paper- It treats in a lucid manner many important questions, and in a non-partisan spirit. There is not a sentence in the whole document, that in dicates partizanship, and any Democratic or R ep'u blica n can endorse t h e most of the president's d el i vera n ce . Space will not permit us to com ment on the message, but we will give its several subjects He recommends criminal prose cution for law-breaking corpor ations, and that campaign con tributions by corporations be prohibited. He denounces lynch ing, and favors capital punish ment for attempted rape, and a law to protect the victim from giving her testimony in public. He wants capital controlled, but it should not be unjustly treated Inheritances should be taxed. There should be an amendment to the constitution so that there can be a national law for divor ces- He condemns San Francis co's attitude toward the Japan ese Advocates a strong navy. and that the army and navy should have its personnel on a high plane. He favors. Ameri can shipping and currency re form- The duties ent'ailed by the Monroe doctrine fully car ried out.' '.The paper while long is very interesting, and the views of the President on lynching will meet with the approval of all law-abiding citizens.

A recent decision of the Unit ed States supreme court has made the enforcement of the dis pensary law harder to enforce. The decision says that no liquor can be seized in transit and held that actual delivery is necessary I before seizure can be made. The effect of this decision will pre vent constables making seizures at the depots, and give illicit dealers an opportunity of secur ing and hiding contraband liquor. It is to be hoped that Claren don's grand juries in the future will refrain from making any reference to the court house, at least, until the little demagogues of politicians are without influ ence with the masses.
