; FEITXFR ON DEBT LIMIT WOULD AMEND CONSTITUTION TO IN CLUDE CITY'S SON -TAXABLE REALTY IN 10 WAX CENT CALCULATION. Thomas L. Feitner. president of th*- Department (nf Taxf-i and Assps«=mpnt!.. in a letter to Controller CMer has taken exception to the following state ment quoted from the Controller's recent address "before the Chamber of Commerce on the debt limit of the ritr: President Feitner the other day advocated the eIIOT-.-lng of the city to tax its own P ro^£t>- If t*o* were accomplished it would increase the "rait of Indebtedness some 15C.000.000. and would be _ a very Flrnpl^ way of reaching the point and obtaining: money for Immediate relief.

BATTLE WITH CHTNEBE PIRATES. HOrSEBOAT ATTACKED RV CREW OF A JUNK-AMERICAN SERIOUSLY HURT. [BT TELrSBArH TO THE TRIBrNF,.] San Francisco, Dec 17.— C. A. Burckhardt. a young man connected with a well known family of brewers in Indianapolis, who represents silk, tea and matting importers in China, arrived here on th« steamer Coptic to-day. For four months he has been In Canton and Yokohoma hospitals recovering from wounds received In a battle with Chinese pirates on the Canton River. Last Jun°. with three other white men. he was going up the Canton River in a houseboat, when the party was attacked by a Chinese piratical junk. Burckhardt was ill with fever, and the at tack was a. surprise. About eighteen pirates swarmed over the rail of the houseboat and the Chinese crew took to the water. Burckhardt was shot three times, but killed two pirates with his pistol, and his companions, who were unhurt, shot six others. Then the pirates retreated, but thr<?w stinkpots, one of which badly burned Burckhardt, and another, which would have sunk the houseboat, was to«se«i overboard by him and exploded, tearing away part of the deckhouse. Burckhardfs wounds were serious, especially one in his shoul der and another in his foot A CORNER IX BROOM CORK. Chicago. Dec. 17.— The National Broom Manufact urers* Association of the United States and < 'ana. met here to-day. Over SO per cent of the manufact uring plants of the United States were represented.

Tt was said that the crop In Missouri and Okla homa is far short of th" a\-erage this season, and this together with the fact that the Union Broom Supply Company has gathered in nearly all the available corn, has brought the price of that com modity to a place where, it is said, there is no profit in the manufacture of brooms. t-VIT OVER THF MAMMOTH CAVE.

TRYING TO SAVE ELM-ST. REFORM CLUB PROTESTS AGAINST AP PROVAL OF PROPOSED FRANCHISE FOR A STREET RAIL ROAD THERE. The Reform Club, through Milo R. Maltble, its secretary, has sent to Controller Coler a protest against approval of the proposed franchise for a street railroad In Elm-st. The proposed franchise was sent by the Municipal Assembly to the Board of Estimate with a request to have the value of the franchise fixed, and the board referred it to Mr Coler for Investigation. The Reform Club be lieves that the franchise should be opposed for the following reasons stated in the letter: First-Traffic will be interfered with. With the exception of Elm-st.. there la at prwnt no "ortn mid south thoroughfare In or "BarjO^wliolJJMJ district of New-Tort that does not co it. *\n all^t one pet of streetcar tracks. The / tree^ K\»S counted that the quick delivery at Sfoods to and from the stores and warehouses * tarded and at timef Impossible. ™s condition which has steadily grown worse. «as appr eaated stasis subs gsgrjagg has been afforded, because for the »? 8t >**%££. The ordinance provides for an . an " v r al th p - lJ fl m s c t nt fl^ 0 per cent of the cross receipts for the i 1i 1 " 1^* compensation under this PJW»stoB wyM^a ceed 15,000 for the mile or mile and a .half of dour, c tr-r-k -nd prohaMv not more than J3.«W. It H , ■opo.eTi f,,r P t^is Ssteniflcant sum £> ££*»<*■£ nanv to maintain tracks in a street that has just been widened at a cost of $6,000,000. the interest on which at th- ow rate of 3 per cent amounts to J i.m.. in other words, a company »«»«*■££•£ haps one-fifth of the street pays only one-sixtieth of the cost of widening alone. , he ordinance also requires the company to pave between the tracks nnd two feet on either side, but this is not a heavy burden, and the companies have e ™^ed the re auiiement In the past, ,md now owe the city man:. SundrSds Of thousand- of dollars for pay in-; Third— The ordinance can be easily evaded, it provides for payment to the city of a percentage of th« gross receipts but Elm-st. does not reach the City Hall where fo many would enter the cars at nighti "and it ends at Astor Place, from beyond which the large traffic in the morning comes. Thus the receipts upon Em-st. itself would be small and ontyvery inadequately represent the value, of the "ourth^-Fares are too hi h. The ordinance legal izes a five cent fare for twenty : years, and yet the line is only about one mile in length. The cits has no power to compel a reduction. Flfth-The franchise period Is too Jong. For twenty-flva years it is irrevocable, except for-viola tion of the contract— a theoretical but not a prac tical remedy— and the company may have a re newal for twenty-five years more upon a. revalua tion of the franchise. Sixth— The grant completes the monopoly aestred by the Metropolitan company. This company al ready controls the entire surface street railroads upon Manhattan Island. The only important north and south street of any length that it does not control is Elm-st. Chapter 190 of the Laws of 1573 granted a portion of this thoroughfare to a subordi nate company of the Metropolitan Railway, but it has not been used, and there is some question whether the courts would consider the grant valid. If they should not. the city could use the Elm-st. line with oast and west streets reaching the fer ries as a leverage, either by promoting the com petition of rival companies or by refusing to grant the franchise until the Metropolitan company ac cepted the city's terms. But whatever may be the policy adopted the city certainly ought not to complete the monopoly of th« Metropolitan com pany on such unfavorable terms to (he city and without a provision rendering the franchise rev ocable at the will of the city.

There is likely ...to be some .outcry' in" Vienna owing to the fact that a -flat has gone forth that some houses in Bogner strasse must be pulled flown. Among these houses Is the Black Caniftl wine shop, a place full of associations. It was founded in the seventeenth century, and has re mained in the hands of the same family ever since. It was a fa-vorlte resort of the composer Beethoven, and many of his letters are preserved there. The most curious . feature of the- place was its early attitude toward its employes. No shopman or oellarman -was ever paid his salary. ' The amount «tue to him was credited In a ledger, and if he wanted to buy anything he had to obtain permis sion of the proprietor. The result of this" enforced thrift was that after a few years he found himself .ho iiiisEssor oX a .socd sun of. money. . _. SCHLEY'S PROTEST READY.

ANOTHER "FLYING DUTCHMAN.* 1 A GERMAN SHIP MAKES THE VOYAGE FROM HAMBURG IN TWENTY-THREE DAYS. Captain Van der Loo of the German ship Najad^. which arrived here yesterday from Bre men, tells a story of a trip across the Atlantic that was made so quickly for a sailing vessel that ho misht almost be called a fitting suc cessor to Captain Van dor D^ken, the flying Dutchman. The Naiad" left Bremen on November 15. Before she had be«n many hours out of port she ran Into the British steamer Westmoreland, bound in from Liverpool, and as a result had one of her plates torn. The captain kept his course, however, until the wind had become a gale, and h*> was obliged to run into Cuxhaven. the port of Hamburg. In order to ride out the ugly weather. From Cuxhaven the captain railed on November 22. without stopping to re pair th" plate, and kept hit; course across the Atlantic until h* sighted Bandy Hook last Sat urda> _ v . „ . The wind was then so strong offshore that he •wnp unwilling to attempt proceeding further, and was obliged to stand off and on until he was able to make port yesterday Had It not been for his delay off Sandy Hook. Captain Van der Loo would have made the run across the ocean— 3..Vx"> miles, according to the chart, or nearly 4.000 miles in actual distance sailed in twenty-three days Throughout the trip, although the wind was furious th* weather remained fair, and not. a single rope was carried away. When the sud den Increase of wind was encountered off Sandy Hook Julius Kuhlmann. a young German, twen ty years old, while attempting with several others to reef the fore upper topsail, was swept off the yard by the stalling of the sail in a stl dpn Ku«t of wind and fell overboard and whs " \ft«r discharging a miscellaneous cargo, she will th*n load with 80.000 cases of rase oil an 1 rail for Yokohama.
