We hare hod (he promise of three band within the lat four weeks, and alt have failed us. We are alone and of course cannot get out the Stand ard as it should he. We shall do the best we can, and our subscribers must he patient. It is worse for us than it is for them. We shall publish no paper next week, unless we cun get a journeyman. The fact is, there nre hut few printers in the state ; nearly all having gone to the war. Four have left our office alone for the array of tho Potomac, and there is probuhly not an officii in tho state hut what hr.s done us well, or better. " That's what's the matter." 1. S.

IIo has hut lit tle to say about the war hardly enough, we think. Tkntii Rkgimknt. The following is an extract from a private letter from Capt. Hiram It. Steele of Co. K, (Derby Line) lOlh regiment, dated Camp Gro ver, Offutt's Cross Road, Md., Nov. 20tb : " We lelt our old quarters at Seneca Lock with all the log cabins and other improvements last week Thursday, (13th) and came to our present camp. Our whole brigade are now encamped togelh r and drilling. Ours is the last regiment and has the right of the brigade. The new camp is pleasant and healthy and twelve miles from Washington. We are not attached to any division but form an Independent brigade, under command of Col. Davij of the 30th fllass., Gen. Gro ver having been ordered to a more re sponsible position. Our Colonel Jewell is very populnr. We are proud of him and mean he shall be of us. Capt. Chandler has been pro moted tu Major. I enjoy the life here very much, like better than anything else I ever did. I went with Capt. Frost of the St. Johosbury company as officer of the day, a few days since, to a store near our camp and seized a quantity of whiskey and emptied it into the ground. We en force the Maine law without any jury trials. We have bad no encounter with the enemy yet. I hope you will hear a good account of us when we do."

The Rbbicl Aumt is Viikiinia. The Baltimore correspondent of the New York Herald assert) that 83,000 rebel troops have been ordered from the West and South to the defense of Richmond against the refits of attacks the Confederates expect to be made upon that city. He also estimntes the rebel nrmy to he 405,000, and that por tion of it under the general command of Lc to be 350,000.

' yr( Mj.) Afureury. From the Eighth Regiment. We are permitted to publish the follow ing letter from F. D. ButterGeld of Co. B, 8th regiment, now on service in the Signal Corps to Col. Steele of Derby Line : Thiiiodkauxvillu, La., 1 Nov. 9, 18C2. J Friend Steele, Yours of ultimo came duly to hand ; I thank you for the favor nnd the interesting matter it contained, and will endeavor in return to post yon in the afluirs from this distant portion of tho great battlefield. I am at present very comfortably quartered with others of the signal party in the once flourishing village of Thibodeaux, but now almost deserted. We have a large two story house assigned to our party, and as our services are not required in camp, we are taking things easy. On the 2-ith ultimo General Weilzal's brigade, consisting of five regiments, 3 cavalry companies and ten batteries, left New Orleans in transports and landed at Donaldsonville, twenty five miles above. We expected some opposition in landing, hut were disappointed, as we should have had an admirable opportunity of teach ing the rebels thut non-interference is their best policy when our gunboats are arrived. We quartered in the deserted houses of Donaldsonville Suturday night. Next morning we took up our line of along Bnyou La Fourche on both sides of which there is a turnpike road, intend ing to form a junction with the 8th reg iment at La Fourche railroad crossing some fifty miles distant. We marched some twenty miles the first day and en camped in the open field at night. We saw some guerillas during the day and shot one captain. We were on the march early Monday morning, first taking the precaution to throw one regiment, the 8 1 h New Hampshire, across the Bayou, not knowing when or where we miht meet the enemy, knowing thut they were in force somewhere in tho vicinity. We had in from the start a bri gade, enabling us to crofs at any point. From information obtained from some captured rebel pickets we expected some warm work before night. My position was in the rear with the 12th Connecti cut. About 12 o clock we heard the booming of cannon. I soon received the message that the enemy were in position on both sides of the Bayou and for the 12lh to move forward and cross the Bay ou to the support of the 8th New Hamp shire. The orders necessary fur the men to relieve themselves of their knapsacks were promptly given and executed, and we moved forward on the double quick abuut half a mile and across the Bayou. We were under a heavy fne w hile cross ing as the enemy's batteries were endea voring to destroy the bridge. The ene my consisted of the 18th Louisiana and Crescent City regiments on this side, posted In riflo pits under cover of woods- supported by three pieces of artillery, commanding our approach on either side of the Bayou. In front was an open field in which the 8th N. II. and 12ih Conn, formed and advanced. Tho en gagement lasted something over an hour, when our hoys charged nnd the rebels skedaddled. Ve captured 208 prisoners and one gun, and killed Col. MePhettrs. The rebel force on the other side of the bayou consisted of 500 militia and Shin nies battery of six pieces, but finding our force so large retreated after firing a doz en shots. The two Louisiana regiments nre veteran troops and haye fought in Virginia, but could not stand the charge of our biave troops. Our loss in the en gagement was 17 killed and 74 Bounded, that of the enemy much less, owing to their position and our superior numbers. I nm of the opinion tl.nt they would noi have made a stand nt all if they hnd known our force. I had the misfortune to have my horse wounded by n piece of shell and become unmanageable; cannot quite agree with soma writers that there is music in shell and solid shot. We met tho 8ih Vermont on Wednesday ; they met wilh no opposition coming up the railroad track, hut had considerable re pairing to do. The 8th have gone on some 18 miles above. We have direel communication with the city by rail and telegraph. Tae rebels have all skedad dled and we hear are in force above Ber wicks' Bay ; do not know whether we go further or not. I am in good health and spirits. Do wish " Mac" might get time to clean out Virginia. Mansfield' Dispensatory says that most of the Sarsapanlla of the shops is inert and worthless. Dr. Ainr in r;tinn on this drug states that not only is it in ert as found in the shops, but so also are most of the preparations from it, or bear I ing its name. He shows, however, that President's Message. Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: Since your last annual assembling, an other year of health and bountiful har vests has passed. And while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way, all will he well. 

FOREIGN AFFAIRS. The correspondence touching foreign affairs, which has taken place during last year is herewith submitted in virtual com pliance with a request to thut effect made by the House of Representatives near the close of tho last session of Congress. If tho conditions of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been nt former periods, it is cer tainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are might rea sonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to expect that the maritime powers, which at the beginning of our domestic difficulties so unwisely and un necessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that position, which has only proved less injurious to themselves than to our own country ; but the temporary reverses which afterward befell the na tional nrms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple jus tice. The civil war which has so radically changed for the moment the occupation and habits of ihe American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition, and affected very deeply the prosperity, of tho nations with which we have car ried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing throughout u period of half a century. It has at the same time exci ted political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agita tion throughout the civilized world. In this unusual agitation we have for borne taking part in any controversy be tween foreign states and between parties or factions in suc'.i states. We have at tempted no propagandise and acknowl edged no revolution, hut have left to ev ery nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contempla ted by foreign nations wilh reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and often exaggerated effects, and the conse quences resulting to those nations them- j selves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwiee. The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade bus been put into operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of especial pleasure to acknowl edge that the execution of it on the part of Her Majesty's Government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of the United Slates and the rights of their moral and loyal citizens. Tho Convention wilh Hanover for the abolition of the Stadt dues has been car ried into full effect under the act of con gress for that purpose. A blockade o! three thousand miles ol sea coast could not he established nnd vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present, without committing occasional misUkes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their sulj-cts. A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside, nnd carrying on trade under treaty stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, nnd possibly to produce neutral reclamations between nations which have a common interest in preserving peacu and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have, so far as possible, heard and redressed com plaints which have been presented by friendly powers. There is, however, a large and augmenting number of doubt ful cases upon which the government is unable to agree with governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United Slates or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of foreign nations which the governments of those slates are not at once prepared to redress. I have pro posed to some of the foreign nation thus interested mutual conventions to ex change and adjust such complaints. proposition has been made especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted. COMPENSATED EMANCIPATION. Oil the 22d day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Execu tive, a copy of which is herewith submit ted. In accordance wilb the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully recall your attention to what roiy be called compen sated emancipation A nation may be said to consit of its territory, its people and its laws. The territory is the only part which is of cer tain durability. One generation passeth away and another generation comcth, but the earth abideth forever. It is of the first -mportance to consider and estimate this ever enduring part that portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States is well adapted to be the home of one national family, and it is not well ndnpted for two or more. Its vast extent and its variety of cli mate and productions are of advantage in this nge for one people, whatever they might have been in former ages. Steam and telegraphs in intelligence have bro't these to be an advantageous combination for one united people. In the inaugural nddress I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of dis union as a remedy for Ihe differences be tween the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot im prove, and which therefore I beg to re peat. One section of our country believe slavery is right and ought to be extend ed, while the other believe it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugi tive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the Afri can slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly support the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This I think cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases, after the separa tion of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade now impeiftct ly suppressed would be ultimately re ceived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the others. SEPARATION IMPOSSIBLE. Physically speaking, we cannot separ ate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between. A husband and wife may be divorced aad go out of the presence and beyond the reach ol each other, but the different parts of our country cannot do this they cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, ei ther amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before ? Can aliens make tieaties easier llian friends can roads a laws ? Cun trea ties he more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws tan be among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always, and when, after much loss on both sides and 10 gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. There is n line straight or crook ed suitable for a rational boundary upan which to divide. Trace througl from the east to the west upon tho line between the free and slave country an! we shall find that a little more than one third of its length are rivers easy to be crossed and popula ted, or soon to be populated, thickly, upon both sides, while nearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people nmy walk back and forth without any cons:iousness of their pres ence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass by writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up on the part of the sec tional obligations upon the seceding sec tion of the fugitive slave clause, along with all other constitutional obligations ppon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. But there is another difficulty ; the great in terior region, bounded east by the Alle gbanies, north hy the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by the line along w hich the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia1, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota and the Territories of Dacotah, Nebraska and part of Colorado has above ten millions of people and will have fifty millions within fifty years fF not prevented by any political folly or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United Slates certainly more than one million of square miles, one half as populous as Massachusetts already is, or would have more than seventy five millions of peo ple. A glance at the map shows that, ter ritorially speaking, it is the great body of the Reuublic The other parts are but marginal borders to it. The magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific being the deepest and also tin richest in developed resources in the production of provisions, grains, grasses, aud all which proceed from them. This great interior region is naturally one of (be most i upon ant in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which has as yet been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products and we shall be over whelmed with the magnitude of the pros pect presented, and yet this region has no sea coast and touches no ocean any where. As part of one nation its people now find and may forever find their way to Europe by New York to South Ameri ca, and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But separale our common country into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not perhaps by a phys ical barrier, but by embarrassing and on erous trade regulations; and this is true wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, nnd still the truth remains that none south of it can trade to any part or pluco north of it, and none north of it can trade to any part or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west and south, are indispensable to the well being of the people inhabiting and to inhabit this vast interior region, which of the three may be best is no proper question ; all are better than either and all of right belong to that people and to their suc cessors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask whero aline of separa tion shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to the great outside world. They too and each of them must have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any nation al boundary. Our natfbnal strife sprung not from our permanent part, not from the land we inhabit, not from our nation al homestead. There is no possible sev ering to this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In all jts ad aptations nnd amplitudes it demands Union nnd abhors separation ; in fact it would ere long force re-union, however much of blood nnd treasure the separa ibn might Miavo cost. Our strife per tains to ourselves, to the passing genera tions of men and it cannot without convul sion be hushed forever with the passing of one generation. Tit a Mississippi a.ki ti;e Xoivrn west. The Grenada (Miss.) Appeal of Nov. 14 has an article treating of the relations of the Northwestern States with New England, the effect of the war upon each section, aud the interest of the former in the navigation of the Mississippi. New England is repre sented as growing rich upon the war, from active employment furnished to its spinners, shoemakers, shipwrights, foun ders, nrtisans of all kinds. The West, on the contrary, has no new demand for its products, is shut out from the great Southern! market, and is paying enor mous freights to railways owned by Eastern capitalists for transporting its grain, flour nnd bacon to the Atlantic seaboard. Under these circumstances the Appeal is not surprised that the Northwest is clamoring for the destruc tion of Vicksburg, and the opening of the Mississippi to commence. But at the same time the Appeal contends that the capture of Vicksburg will not affect the commercial condition of the North western States, because until Mr. Lin coln can line both shores of the Missis sippi, from Cairo to New Orleans, with armed men, no trading vessel can nav igate its waters. The Northwestern States profess to ho fighting for the Union, but that means nothing more than free trade on the Mississippi. When Vicksburg is taken tljey will find themselves as far as ever from their ob ject ; and as "they have no sympathy with New England, further than New England may aid the - West in opening the great river to the commerce of the West," the Appeal believes they will be reaily to cut adrift from (he East. Af ter these speculations the Appeal comes to the nub of the matter as follows : Twelve months ago a gentleman pro. posed to the Confederate authorities to go to Ihe Northwest, and quietly and through the press, to urge the necessity of an alliance between those States and those of the lower valley of the Missis sippi, It was then thought by our lead ers that we would soon put an end to this struggle, and (be Northwest, under the supposition that we sought to deprir j them of their most valued commercial rights, has continued to furnish the Fed eral Government with (he bravest and best troop in the Northern armies. Of late, this subject has again attracted at tention, and if we nre not ill-informed our government has been induced to give it serious attention. Southerners may imagine that they can detach Ihe great Northwest from tl.s Union, but they will find themselvts greatly deceived. Rebel Negotiations. There ap pears to have been some truth, after all in the recent rumors of some negotia tions going on between leading rebels nnd certain prominent Democrats of New York city. In a speech delivered last Saturday e;vening, Fernando Wood is reported to have spoken substantially us follows : " Mr. Wood said he had received in formation uud had communicated it to tho government, that under certain cir cumstances the South were ready to re turn aye, from leading statesmen of ti e South. Men of position and influence in the southern confederacy had express ed a desire to return under a Democratic rule ; the past lo he forgotten, the public debt oh both sides to be provided fur, and they were willing to let by-goues bn b) gones if the North would, and tho Union once again bo restored. (Terrific cheers, lasting several minutes)." Feveiis. There have been an un usual number of cases of fevers in this vicinity the present fall the old inhab itants say more than heretofore for many years. Some one who has taken pains to ascertain, finds there have been some ninety cases in and within one mile of Bradford village. They have not been howevei of a malignant type, and but few cases comparatively have proved fatal. Bradford Telegraph. TJOStOll TVlXX"lSLOt. ( Corrected Weekly from the X. E. Farmer.)
