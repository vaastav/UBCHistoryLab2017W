He savs that it chon and t ot be presumed in a Ivance that, the President elect will fail to enf< rce the Fugitive Slave Law, as this would be un just and contrary to Christian charity. Let us wait for the overt act. He then de j dares against the right.of secession, and says to admit it, the Union tn ghi I.* brok- i en into fragments in two week- Hr* quotes the language of .Ja< k-on and Madi-on.— ■Secession is altogether founded on .m in ference in the ('• uistirnti'ifi The Union was designed to be rerpe’u ated. lie then quotes the Constitution in support of this view- The framers of the Constitution never intended to plant in its bosom seeds for its own destruction. They were not unmindful of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolu’ion. The right of resistance against tvrann- and op pression, however, cannot be denied T his right is asserted in the Declaration of In dependence, bnt secession is neither more nor less than revolut’- n He speaks of j the atfairs of South Carolina He does ! not apprehend that an attempt will be made to seize the fort, but if in this he is mistaken, the officers have orders to act -ti icily on the defensive. Let the respon sibiiitv rest on the hands of those who provoke the contest He invokes bis countrymen to pause before attempt ing to destroy the Union which ha- conferred so rnanv benefit*. He argues that Congress can do much to restore peace by propos ing and recommending an amendment to the Constitution for remedying the exist- | ing evil. The very coure he recommends is to j have an explanatory clause or amendment of the Slave question, first, expressly re cognizing tie right of property in slaves in States where slavery now is, ,>r may hereafter exist Secondly, ft.e first duty of protecting such tights in all the coming Territories, until the latter are admitted 1 a.-, in the Union. Thirdly, a like recogni j tion. After alluding to the great commercial agricultural and other material prosperities j of the country, the President asks, *• why i* it tl en that discontent now *o exten- j sively prevails and the union of the States • which is the source of a'l those blessings is threatened with destruction. The 1 otig continued and intemperate in tei terence ofihe Northern people with the question of slavery in Southern States has av. length produced its natural effect. Ihe different sections ofihe Union are! now arrayed against each other, and the ' time has arrived so much dreaded by the | father of his country v\ fieri hostile geo- ' graphical parties have been formed.

Sooner or later the bonds ot union must be severed. “ It is my conviction that this fatal pe riod has not yet arrived.’’ After referring to the incessant agitation against slavery at the North, for the last thirty years, loth by the pre-s and 'he peo pic and asmrliiig that the time oft -egress i* occupied with violent lies on the never ending subject, he remarks; ** How easy wou'd it be f-.r rhe Arneri- i can people to set'! the slavery qtiestion , forever, and restore peace and harmonv to this districted c * .ntrv, which can h* done by letting the slave stn’e- done, and per milling them to u mage their own state affairs, as they only are responsible l-efc-re (rod for slavery existing among them, and wtth which li e North has n more right to interfere titan with the similar institutions in Russia and Brazil The I’resident still rehe on the good sense and forbearance -if the people v ing it is out of the p>srni any President to accomplish but little which !ed him to observe that the election of any one of our fellow citizens to *hc office of I’reei dent doe* not ofitaelf afford just -a :• * for dissolving the Union.

It will be the duty of the next President as it lias been mv own, to act with vigor in executing the fugitive slave law against conflicting enact met sot -late legislatures We are not to presume in advance that lie will violate h e duty, which would be at war with everv principle of justice.— Let, us wait tor the oven act. The fugitive slave law has been carried into execution in every contested cas<- since the commencement of the present administration. Let ns trust that the State legislature* will repeal their uncon stitut oriel and obnoxious enactments. — Unless this shall be done without unn r essary delay, it is impossible fur any hu man power (<> save the Union.

The only acts of Congress on the statute book beating on t is subject are those of 28t.. Feb uhi v. 1705, and 3d March 1807 These authorize the pres dent after he shall have a--enabled ’hat the Marshal with hi * p "e comtia ins i- unable to ex ecute cim o ciim.n.a' p.-.*ce>- in any par ticular case to cab <*nh •- iiidiiia. and employ tile arm, mid a .' \ to aid him in petfonnir g this service, having first bv prodam t on commanded the insurgents to disperse and retire peacably to their respective abodes within a limit and time. This duty cannot Ia any possibility be performed in a state where no judicial au thorily exists to issue proce-s, and where there is no marshal to execute it, and where even if there were such an officer, the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present laws can not he amended so a- to carry out more etfeciu ally the objects of the constitution. The revenue sti 1 continues to be collected as heretofore at the Custom House at Charles ton and should the collector unfortunately resign a successor may be app duted to perform this du'y. It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel he United Sta'es from its property there by force; bu if in this I should be mistaken the offi ers in com maud of the bets have received orders to act strictly on the defen-ive In such a contingency, the re-pon-ibilit j fot conse quences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the as-ailants. In reference to reorganizing a seeding state a an utdepemh nt government, hv tlit- President, he says it. would he a naked art of usurpation on his part, and if is his duty to submit to Congress the tv hr ; ■ question in all its bearing.-. The probability, of an omo r g< nr-*. soon arising when Congress ml, I 1 . ... and on :o decide the question whether it p .s-essen power to compel a Mate to ta gu in the Union, authorizes him to exp < ■ titeopin ion that no sm-h power has been delega’ed to Congress, or to ativ other deparunenl of the federal government. it is manifest that this is n t among the specific and enu erative powers granted to Congress, and it is equally apparent that its exerci e is not necessary and proper for carrying into execution any one of these powers. The President declare* that to make war upon a state is at variance with the snirT ot the Constitution, and af'er having conquered a state how aio we to govern i' : We could no*, govern hv despot <• ik.w <-r, nor could we ov p ivsicai force compe iis people to elect ,i om *or and I)). e-eii lative and pet niio. !• r duties upper laming to an ;n- • •in ,■ s ate.

In every foreign reg.ou of die Globe the title of \uterie oi <-itiz**ns is held in ice highest respect, and when pronounced in a foreign land it causes lire hearts of our countrymen to swell With honest pride Surely, when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss, we sli.di recoil with hor ror from the fatal plunge Bv such a dread catastrophe the h pes of the friends of freedom throughout the wot Id would be destroyed, and long night of leaden des pot ism would enshroud the nations. Our example for more than eighty years, would not only be lost, but it would be quot ed as a conclusive proof that man is unfit tor red government. The slavery que-lion, like every thing human ha its day. I fervently believe that it lias already reached and past the culminating point ; but if in the of the existing excitement the Union shall j er ish. the evil may then become irreparable Congres can contribute no ch to avert it bv proposing and recommending to the legislature of the several states the reme •iy for existing evils which slie Constitu tion has itself provided for its own prefer v.Vion Hie President proposes liiat bis explanalorv amendment to the Constitu tion be adopted bv for the final settlement of the Prim construction of the constitution on three special points An express recog’ t i iouofthe lights of pro er tv in slaves m the 'tate> wliere i> n >w t *x ist.

Removal of the Remains of Co lumbus. It is stated from Havana that the re mains of Christopher Columbus, the Djs. coverer of the New World, are again to he removed to anew anil splendid cemetery soon to be opened near that city They are to be deposited in a silver urn. upon which will be inscribed in letters of gold, the most remarkable events of his great enterprise. A bronze statue is also to be eiec’ed over them, representing the great discoverer in the attitude of revealing the grand mission of his wonderful life. Columbus died Ascension day. the 29th of May, iu about die seventieth year of his age His obsequies were celebrate! with great pomp at Valladolid and his body deposited in the convent of San Fran cisco. Thence, nine years after, in dm tear 1513 it was removed to the Carthu sian nionasfry of Seville, where was like wise d**posit< (} the body i f hi* Diego. Tweu'y-three t ears after, in the year 1 />-'JG, the bodies ot Dot Ij the Admiral and his son were removed with appropriate pomp and ceremonies to the New Woi'd he had dscoveied, anil interred in the principal chapel ot S:m Domingo, rli-paniola.— There ti ev remained undisturbed tor the period of 259 years, !n the year 1795 however, at the close i.ftlie war between France and Spain, all the Spanish possessions in the Ish.nd of Hispaniola weie ceded to France, whete npon a request was prefei red to the French Governor to have tße remains of Colum bus removed to Cuba. The request was granted, and on the 20th of December, 1195, the vault in the cathedral of San Domingo was. for the first time in nearly three hundred yec<r, opened. Wirhin," shvr the record of the event, 11 were found ihe flagmen's of R lea-ten coffin. >. nnmh r of honos, and a quantity of m-niid, ev it J - 1 . lv the remains ot a human b >dv. 1 tu-'H were carefully collected and put into a • a>e of gilded lead, about hair an ell in length and breadth, and ii rd in iieigo!, secured bv ati iron .o<-k. .<• kev o' which wa • delivered to tha A . hop. The case was enclosed in i cufii i covered with black velvet, and ornamented with lace fringe of gold.” After appropriate funeral ceremonies, th3 body was taken on board the ship Sa Lorenzo and taken to Havana, where it arrived on the 15ih of January, 1790 It was received in the most solemn manner, with all the honors given to a sovereign. “ On arriving at. the mule, the remains were met by the Governor of the Island, accornpanied by In’s generals and military staff. The coffin was then conveyed be tween files of soldiery, w hich lined the streets to t he obelbk. in ihe Place d'Anne* here it, was receive*! in a hearse prepared for the purpose. Heie the remains were formally delivered to the tfovernor and (’attain (reieral <>f the Island, lit© key given up t<> him. the cotlin opened and ex amined, acd 'tie sale transportation of its • ontents auiuetittcated The ceremony concluded, (he solemn rites for the (Bad were perfumed bv tlie Arc.hibi.sbop, and the remains of the g- eat discoverer were again deposited in the wall, ©n the right side of the yrand alter of the Cathedral of Havana, where thev have ever since remained, the object of reverence to at! visitors of the Island. Nothing c m he said against auv honors that may be done, on occasion of opening a new cemetery in Havana to the memory of one so illoustiious. The erection of a sta'ue would certainly be very appropriate. But why again disturb the bones of the great discoverer ? They n..w rest in a con secrated place, in a building whose walls have only become tinner as they grow gray with years, and which proof, so far as any edifice can be proof, against the elements gives everv guarantee of protection, and why should the mortal remains of the great Admiral be not allowed, then, to rest at last in peace ?
