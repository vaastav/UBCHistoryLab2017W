TWENTY-FIVE CENTS PER MONTH. Roosevelt's Annual Message Submitted to Congress Today WASHINGTON, Dec g—President - velt's annual message, the last :, L t the present executive M ill send ..tigress, was r.ad in' the house and senate today. The galleries were ked. The senate gave the closest Attrition today to reading of the pr ssident's message following the cer emonies of swearing in Senator Cum mins of lowa. The reading began at 12.17 and was completed at 1:55, when adjournment was taken until to morrow. The house also listened at t ntively, then adjourned at 2:40. The message was in part as follows: 'The financial standing of the na tion at the present time is excellent, .tnd the financial management of the nation's interests by the government during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our currency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly to be hoped that the curren cy commission will be able to pro pose a thoroughly good system which wil. do away with the existing defects. Corporations. "As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, and especially the railroads, I can only re- I eat what I have already again and again said in my messages to the con ure s. I believe that under the inter state clause of the constitution the important factors in modern business. United States has complete and para mount right to control all agencies of Interstate commerce, and I believe that lit- national government alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure jus tice from, and to do justice to, the great corporations which are the most Important factors in modern business, [be! ye that it is worse than foily to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, hecause such a law can be en forced only imperfectly and unequally, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead of an unwise eft >rt to prohibit all combinations, there shall be substituted a law which dial expressly permit combinations whii-h are in the interest of the pub lic, but shall at the same time give to 8 ime Agency of the national govern ment full power of control and su pervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be the ■ecuring entire i übiicity in all matters which the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by Judicial hut hy executive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form 9f Improper favoritism or other wrong doing. • The railways of the country should be put completely under the interstate commerce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and con trol over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been ~re of the most valuable features in recent legislation. ' Telegraph an l te'ephone companies engaged in interstate business should t"* rut under the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission. ' The opposition to government con ;" >1 of these great corporations makes its most effective effort in the shape °f an appeal to the old doctrine of states' rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in an restricted individualism in business, 1 t as there were formerly many sin cere men who believed in slavery— that is, in the unrestricted right of 3 n individual to own another individ aal These men do not by themselves have jreat weight however. -The ef fectlve fierht against adequate govern- control and supervision of in dividual, and especially of corporate, wea th engaged in interstate business Is i Mefly done under cover; and es- Pc taffy under cover of an appeal to states' rights.

EVENING STATESMAN of all government. Some must lie | outside the domain of the federal gov ernment. But there is legislation (which the federal government alone :can enact and which is absolute'y vital Sin, order to secure the attainment of | our purpose. Many laws are needed. Labor. "There are many matters affecting I labor and the status of the wageworker to which I should like to draw your attention, but an exhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspects is not now necessary. This administration is nearing its end; and, moreover, under our form of government the solution of the problem depends upon the action of the states as much as upon the ac tion of the nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set before you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them in mind. A blind and ig norant resistance to every effort for j the reform of abuses and for the re ; adjustment of society to modern in jdustrial conditions represents not true conservatism but an incitement to the wildest radicalism; for wise radical ism and wise conservatism go hand in hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change is made unless in the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady ef forts in many different directions, to bring about a condition of affairs un der which the men who work with hand or with brain, the laborers, the super intendents, the men who produce for the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share than at pres ent of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to invest it in the tools and instruments by which all work is car ried on. Protection for Wageworkers. "The above is the merest * sketch, hardly even a sketch in outline, of the reforms for which we should work. But there' is one matter with which the congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any palt ering with the question of taking care lof the wage woskers, under our pres ent industrial system, become killed, cripp'ed, or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority of wageworkers must j have their rights secured for them by j state action; but the-national govern j ment should legislate in thoroughgo ing and far-reaching fashion not only Jfor all employees of the national gov jernment. but for all persons engaged J irj interstate commerce. The object j sought for could be achieved to a j measurable degree, as far as those (killed or cripp'ed are concerned, by proper emp'oyers' liability laws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out. I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward pro viding old-age pensions have been tak .en in many of our private industries, j These may be indefinitely extended through voluntary association and con tributory schemes, or through the agency of savings banks, as under the recent Massachusetts plan. j To strengthen these practical measures should be our immediate duty; it is not at present necessary to consider tne larger and more general governmental schemes that most European govern ments have found themselves obliged to adopt. The Courts. "I most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of increasing the to taly inadequate salaries now given to our judges. On the whole there is no I body of pub ie servants who do as valuable work, nor whose moneyed re ward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with the su oreme court the judges should have their salaries doubled. It is not be fitting the dignity of the nation that Hts most honored public servants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn in private life that the performance of public ser vice by them implies an exceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. "It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the iong delays which now obtain in the administration of justice, and which operate with pecu liar severity against persons of small means, and favor only the very crimi nals whom it is most desirable to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should be devised. Much of this in tolerable delay is due to improper re gard paid to technicalities which are a mere hinderance to justice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has resuted in a striking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic. "At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent and sweeping attack upon the entire judi ciary of the country, an attack couched in such terms as to include the most upright, honest and broad-minded judges, no less than those of narrower mind and more restricted outlook. It was the kind of attack admirably fit ted to prevent any successful attempt to reform abuses of the judiciary, be cause it gave the champions of the unjust judge their eagerly desired op portunity to shift their ground into a 

WALLA WALLA, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1908. ( championship of just judges who were unjustly assailed. Last year, before the house committee on the judiciary, these same iabor leaders formulated their demands, specifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compro i mise, stating they wished the princi ple of that bill or nothing. They in sisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no injunction should issue ex cept to protect property right; and specifically provided that the right to carry on business should not be con strued as a property right; and in a second provision their bill made in a labor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons that would not have been uniawful if done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalized blacklisting and boy cotting in every form, legalizing, for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike commission so unreservedly con demned; while the right to carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under that protection which the law j throws over property. The demand was made that there shou'd be trial by jury in contempt cases, thereby most ser iously impairing the authority of the courts. All this represented a course of policy which, if carried out, would mean the enthronement of class pri vilege in its crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the most essential factions of the judici ary in all civilized lands. "The violence of the crusade for this legislation, and its complete failure, il lustrate two truths which it is essen tial our people should learn. In the first place, they ought to teach the workingman, the laborers, the wage worker that by lemanding what is im proper and impossible he plays into the hands of his foes. Such a crude vicious attack upon the courts oven if it were temporarily success ful, would inevitab y in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the great mass of citizens together forc ing them to stand by all the judges, competent and incompetent alike, rath er than see the wheels of justice stop ped. A movement of this kind can ultimately result in nothing but dam age to those in whose behalf it is nomi nally undertaken. This is a most healthy truth, which it is wise for all our people to learn. Any movement based on that class hatred which at times assumes the name of 'class con sciousness' is certain ultimately to fail, and if it temporarily succeeds, to do far-reaching damage. 'Class con sciousness,' where it is merely another name for the odious vice of class sel fishness, is equally noxious whether in an emp'oyer's association or in a workingman's association. The move ment in question was one in which the appeal was made to all workingmen to vote primarily, not as American citizens, but as individuals of a certain class in society. Such an appeal in the first place revolts the more high minded and far-sighted among the per sons to whom it is addressed, and in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among all other classes of citizens, whom it therefore tends to unite against the very orga nization on whose behalf it is issued. The result is therefore unfortunate from every standpoint. This healthy truth, by way, wi 1 be learned by the socialists' if they ever succeed in establishing in this country an impor tant national party based on such class consciousness and selfish class inter est. "The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of government. Respect for the law is essential to the permanence of our In stitutions; and respect for the law is largeiy conditioned upon respect for the courts. It is an offense against the republic to say anything which can weaken this respect save for the grav est reason and in the most careful'y guarded manner. Our judges should be held in peculiar honor; and the duty or respectful and truthful comment and criticism, which should be binding when we speak of anybody, should be especially binding when we speak of them. On an average they stand above any other servants of the community, and the greatest judges have reached the high level held by those few great- j est patriots whom the whole country delights to honor. But we must face I the fact there are wise and unwise judges, just as there are wise and un wise executives and legislators. When I a president or a governor behaves im properly or unwisely, the remedy is • easy, for his term is short; the same ] is true with the legislator, although ! not to the same degree, for he is one of many, who belong to some given legislative body, and it is therefore less easy to fix his personal responsi- j bfllty and hold him accountable there- j for. With a judge, who. being human, is also likely to err, but whose tenure is for iife. there is no similar way of holding him to responsibility. Under ordinary conditions the only forms of pressure to which he is in any way j amenable are. public opinion, and the action of his fellow judges. It is the ' last which is most immediately ef fective. and to which we should look j for the reform of abuses. Any remedy applied from without is fraught with 

ESTABLISHED 1861 risk. It is far better, from every stand point, that the remedy should come from within. In no other nation in the world do the courts wield such vast and far-reaching power as in the United States. All that is necessary is that the courts as a whole should exercise this power with the far sighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the future while they act In the present. Let them exer cise this great power not only honest ly and bravely, but with wise insight into the needs and fixed purposes of the people, so that they may do jus tice, and work equity, so that they may protect all persons in their rights, and yet break down the barriers of privilege, which is the foe of right. Forests. i ' If there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our child ren and our children's children to per form at once. it is to save the for ests of this country, for they consti tute th I first and most important ele ment in the conservation of the na tural resources of the country. There are of course two kinds of natural re sources. One is the kind which can only be used as a part of a process of exhaustion; this is true of mines, na tural oil and gas wells, and the like. The other, and of course ultimately by far the most important, includes the resources which can be improved in the process of wise use; the soil, the rivers, and the forests come under this head. Any really civilized nation will so use a'l of these three great national assets that the nation will have their benefit in the future. Just as a farm er, after all his life making his living from his farm, wiil, if he is an ex pert farmer leave it as an asset of increased value to his son, so we should leave our national domain to our child ren, increased in value and not worn out. There are small sections of our own country, in'the east and in the west, in the Adirondacks, the White Mountains, and the Appalachians, and in the Rocky mountains, where we can already see for ourselves the damage in the shape of permanent injury to the soil and the river systems which comes from reckless deforestation. It mat ters not whether this deforestation is due to the actual reckless cutting of timber, to the fires that inevitably fol low such reckless cutting of timber, or to reckless and uncontrolled grazing, especial y hy the great migratory bands of sheep, the unchecked wandering of which over the country means des truction to forests and disaster to the small home makers, the settlers of limited means. "Shortsighted persons, or persons blinded to the future by desire to make money in every way out of the pre sent, sometimes speak as if no great damage would be done by the reck less destruction of our forests. It is difficult to have patience with the ar guments of these persons. Thanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, we have already crossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and no measures that we now take can, at least for many years, undo the mischief that has al ready been done. But we can prevent further mischief being done; and it would be in the highest degree repre hensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or temporary cost interfere with such action, es pecially as regards the national for ests which the nation can now, at this very moment, control. inland Waterways. "Action should be begun forthwith, during the present session of the con gress, for the improvement of our in land waterways—action which will re sult in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars upon thes% waterways, yet the traffic on nearly all of them is steadily declin ing. This condition is the direct re sult of the absence of any comprehen sive and far-seeing plan of waterway improvement. Obviously we can not continue thus to expend the revenues of the government without return. It is poor business to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it. National Parks. "I urge that all our national parks adjacent to national forests be placed completely under the control of the forest service of the agricultural de partment, instead of leaving them as they now are, under the interior de partment and policed by the army, the congress should provide for super intendents with adequate corps of first class civilian scouts, or rangers, and further, place the road construction under the superintendent instead of leaving it with the war department. Such a chamge in park management wou d result in economy and avoid the difficulties of administration which now arise from having the responsibi lity of care and protection divided be tween different departments. The need for this course is peculiarly great in the Yellowstone park. This, like the Yosemite, is a great wonderland, and should be kept as a national play ground. In both all wild things should be protected, and the scenery kept ivhoily unmarred. "I am happy to say that I have been able to set asfde in various parts of the country small, well-chosen tracts 3f ground to serve as sanctuaries and nurseries for wild creatures. Denatured Aichohol. "I had occasion in my message of May 4, 1906, to urge the passage of some law putting alcohol, used in the arts, industries, and manufacturers, upon the free list; that is. to provide for the withdrawal free of tax of al cohol which is to be denatured for those purposes. The law of June 7, 1906, and its amendment of March 2, 1907, accomplished what was desired in that respect, and the use of dena tured alcohol, as intended, is making a fair degree of progress, and is en titled to further encouragement an 1 support from the congress. Pure Food. "The pure food legislation has al ready worked a benefit difficult to overestimate. Indian Service. "It has been my purpose from the beginning of my administration to take the Indian service completely out of the atmosphere of political activity, and there has been steady progress to ward that end. The last remaining stronghold of politics in that service was the agency system, which had seen its best days and was gradua ly falling to pieces from natural or pure ly evolutionary causes, but, like all such survivals, was decaying Blowfly, in its later stages. It seems clear that its extinction had better be made now, so that the ground can be cleared for larger constructive work on beha'f of the Indians, preparatory to their in duction into the full measure of res ponsible citizenship. On November 1 only 18 agencies were left on the rost er; with two exceptions, where some legal questions seemed to stand tem porarily in the way, these have been changed to superintendences, and their heads brought into the classified civil <service. Secret Ssrvice. "Last year an amendment was incor porated in the measure providing for the secret service, which provided that there should be no detail from the secret service and no transfer there from. It is not too much to say that this amendment has been of benefit only, and could be of benefit, to the criminal classes.

Wilkins, of the local Salvation army corps,, for the annual Christmas dinner for the poor and needy of the city. Already the baskets which will contain the delicacies of the holiday season have been secured, and boxes for the do nations of the more prosperous have been placed in the business houses. Friday has been set as the day for the appearance of the "boiling pots" on the street corners, and old Santa will not be lacking. It is estimated that in the neigh borhood of 40 boxes will be put out this year b.v the local army workers each box containing sufficient provis ions for a family of six people, and two chickens will be substituted for the beef roast that was given last year. It is requested that farmers or others wishing to donate poultry to the cause, leave the gifts with Ad jutant Wilkins at Army headquarters. West Alder street, or at his home. 704 West Poplar street. An estimate of the cost of t". ; e Christmas program as mapped out by Adjutant Wilkins will aggregate $190, and in order that there may be no dis appointments, it is desired that sub scriptions be made as liberally as pos sible. Each basket given out is to cost approximately $3, and as there will be 40 of them, the cost of the dinners alone will reach the $120 mark. The tree to be at Army barracks, 117 West Alder street, has been estimated at $30, and hired help and sundries have been listed at $40. In addition to the expenses incurred for holiday cheer, Adjutant Wilkins estimates that shoes and clothing will be needed, as last year more than $20 was required to supply the needy with clothing. Any cash that may be left over after the holiday festivities are closed, will be used in purchasing clothing and shoes. Bierd of Pardons Meets at Prison H. T. Jones, J. H. Davis, M. L. Piles and C. S. Reed, members of the state board of pardons, are in session at the state penitentiary this week, and have a list of about 200 applications for leniency to consider. It is probai N that their work will occupy nearly the entire week, and that the results o£ the meeting will be given out about Saturday.

The various locals throughout the state are now electing representa tives, and by the announcements of elections alone, the Garden City is deriving no small amount of publicity. While this city is not centrally lo cated, thus preventing some of the smaller organizations from being rep resented, it i s thought that the conven tion will be exceptionally well attend ed, as there are a number of important business considerations to come up for discussion. It is probable that the meetings, except when the convention goes into executive session, will be public, the tendency of the labor or ganizations being more and more to ward the publicity of their transact ions. Secretary Robert Carey, of the Y. M. C. A., has tendered to the local com tee the use of the assembly room, with a seating capacity of 400 people. Elks Announce Big Carnival "Good!

The executive committee, consisting of Fire Chief William Metz, J. J. Kauffman, B. C. Holt and H. B. Ker shaw, is formulating plans for one of the jolliest times ever indulged in by Walla Wallans. and the fact that the city's two heavy-weights, Metz and Kauffman, are on the committee, backed by such live fun-producers as Holt and Kershaw speaks most fav orably for the success of the under taking, which wiH be along lines sim ilar to the fraternal carnival conducted by the Maccabees in Armory hall for the past several years. While definite announcement as to certain members to be contained on the week's program cannot b> given at this time. Chief Metz. with a "naughty little twinkle" in his eye, said this morning that the "stunts would be new and original." That is enough.

Raymond, state superintendent of the Anti-Saloon league of Washington, has resigned his position, and Boyd P. Do ty, attorney for the organization, has been appointed to succeed him. Yes terday a dispatch from New York stated that Mrs. Raymond had brought suit for divorce at Stratford. Conn., and that the allegations made in the complaint involved two members of Mr. Raymond's former congregation. Rev. Mr. Raymond's resignation was sent to the executive committee of the Anti-Saloon league two weeks ago. At a meeting of the executive com mittee, held shortly before noon Sat urday at the headquarters in the Ar cade Annex, the resignation was ac cepted and Mr. Doty appointed to suc ceed him. L. E. Kirkpatrick, one of the mem bers of the executive committee, said last night that the league knew noth ing of Mr. Raymond's domestic af fairs, and that the superintendent had resigned because' of ill health. "Rev. Mr. Raymond is badly in need of a rest," said Mr. Kirkpatrick. "He has been suffering from an affection of the throat, which was aggravated by the strain of public speaking. He informed the cemmittee that he had been advised by physicians that he must either take a complete rest soon or submit to an operation. "As the resignation had not been formally accepted by the committee and a successor to him had not been chosen until Saturday, it was not deemed necessary to make a public announcement. Mr. Raymond had an engagement to speak at North Yakima and left Saturday afternoon for east ern Washington. Mr. Doty also had a speaking engagement and I believe left in the afternoon."
