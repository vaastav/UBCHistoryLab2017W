Friday was cold as Greenland's icy mountains; Satur day, ditto; Sunday, a regular sou'wes tor, accompanied with rain; Monday mid. Tuesday mild and pleasant enough Wednesday not so much so ; and Thurs day regular winter again, with heavy snow-clouds banking up in t lie northern heavens. The Knoxville Chronicle calls it "our genial climate," and wo rather think it is. Muss in tho Mountains. Tlio engineer of a North Carolina ap pie-wagon, who reached this place in the early part of tho week, says several more distinct shocks of earthquake were felt along tho i'.ig Smoky range about ten days ago. Ho reports that tho pco plo living on and contiguous to the mountain aro becoming nervous at their frequent occurrence, npprchcndiiig a heavy calamity sonio time, sooner or later. lie also states that a day or two subsequent to tho more recent shocks, largo numbers of deer and bear were RQcn in the adjacent valleys, having, no doubt, been frightened from their ac customed haunts bv the unusual com motion In the mountain. The Forty-Third Congress. Tho Knoxville Chronicle is pushing the claims of lion. Horace Maynard for the Speakership of tho new House of Representatives with a good deal of en ergy and plausibility, lie possesses am pie qualifications, and certain v no one has ever served party and party inter csU with more untiring zeal and devo tion. New England having tho Vice President in the election of Senator Wilson, the Chroniclo thinks the pro motion of Mr. Maynard to the third of fice would be a grateful recognition of the claims of a section which has been for sonic time without a direct repre sentative in the general government. The Speaker of the present House, Mr. Blaine, it is thought, will not bo a can didate for re-election. Alabama. The muddlo in tlio Alabama Legisla ture continues the Radical insurgents holding out and meeting in a separate building. United States troops are sta tioned in tho vicinity for what purpose is not stated, but it is supposed their presence is intended to overawe the le gally elected body, and secure tho re turn of Spencc, the administration can didate, to tho United States Sonata. When a Radical has onco tasted the emoluments of office, nothing but death and the devil will ever wean him. The daughter of the horse-leech ain't a cir cumstance to him in point of tenacity. This revolutionary programme on the part of the Radical clement in Alabama is &lighlly illustrative of tho moral ef fect of Gen. Grant's re-election by an increased majority. The Chattanooga Herald. The publication of tho Daily Herald has been suspended and tho paper will hereafter appear as a weekly, which its proprietor thinks will bo better adapted to the wants of the pcoplo of that sec tion, and more profitable to himself in a financial point of view. Chattanooga possesses superior advantages of loca tion, and in duo course of timo will at tain to a population of fifteen or twen ty thousand inhabitants; but it is not able as yet to support two daily papers in fact, hardly one as it ought to be sup ported to make it a live and flourishing institution a benefit to the community and profitable to tho proprietors. But wo think Governor Bard makes a mis take in merging the Daily Herald into iv Weekly. It seems to us that a Semi Weekly, witli news and local affairs as the specialities and politics the incident, might be niado to live, and, in connec tion with a good job office, grow into something more substantial and profit able than the present stinted and poorly paying journalism of the interior towns. Wo intend no reflection upon any one, and merely throw out the suggestion for tlio consideration of our friend, whom uc would bo glad to bcc prosper.. Death of Horace Greeley, Tho telegraph dispatches last Satur day morning announced tho deatli of tho Hon. lloraco (Jrcolcy, which occurred a few tninute8 before 7 o'clock on tho previous evening. Having been for more than a quarter of a century at the head of tho ablest political journal of tlio country, and universally recognized for his great moral and mental worth, his death is regarded as a national calamity and tails forth expressions of regret and sorrow from all classes, Ho was a great and a good man In tho fullest and strongest sense, and has left tho Impress of a mighty mind and of a noble and generous naturo upon tho history of tho times in which ho lived and labored. Mr. Greeley was a nativo of Now Hampshire, and was near the closo of his C2d year. We copy from tho Tri btino an account of his illness and last hours : So for as any of his associates knew, Mr. Greeley was in almost as good health as usual when on the day after tho election ho wroto tho card announc ing his resumption of tho editorial charge of the Tribune. His sleepless ness, known to few, became greatly worse, but for years ho has sullcred moro or less from the samo difficulty, and now it is clear that a sufficient al lowance had not been mado for the in tenso strain upon him throughout the summer, especially during the last mouth of his wife's illness. But it soon became evident mat his sirengtli was unequal to the hard task to which ho set himself. Ho wrote onlv three or four careful articles, not one of them half a column in length; most notable, per haps was that entitled "Conclusions," wherein ho summed up his views of the canvass. In all ho wroto less than three and a half columns alter his re turn, contributing to only four issues of tho paper. Two or three times he hand ed his assistant short articles, saying: "lliero is an Idea worth using but J have not felt able to work it out properly, you had better put it in shape." At last on Tuesday, the 12th iusjant, lie aban doned the cllbrt to visit the office regu larly, and sent for tho family physician of Mr. A. J. Johnson, a friend "with whom he was a guest and in whose house his wife had died. Every effort was made to induce sleep, but ho grow steadily worse till it became evident that Ii is case was critical. Dr. Geo. C. S. Choalc and others were in consulta tion, and finally it was decided to take him to Dr. Choate's residence, two or three miles distant from Mr. Greeley's own country house at Chappnqua. Here ho received the unremitting attention of Dr. Choalc, and here Dr. Brown Se qnard, Dr. Brown anil otlier3 were call ed in consultation. Tho insomnia had developed into inflammation of the brain, and under this the venerated pa tient rapidly sank. At times he was de lirious; at other times as clear headed as ever. lie. lost llcsh and strength with startling rapidity and in a few days the possibility of his speedy death forced it self into unwilling recognition. It was not however, till Thursday thai his as sociates and family brought themselves lo admit it, and oven they still clung to his faith in the vigor of'his constitu tion. On Wednesday night ho failed very rapidly, Thursday afternoon and veiling ho seemed somewhat easier. During the night he slept very uneasy, muttering occasionally, and frequently- raising ins right hand. J owards morn ing he was more quiet, and between 8 and !J o'clock fell into a nearly uncon scious condition, which continued with some intervals through tho day. He made occasional exclamations', but man v of them in consequence of his extreme weakness and apparent inability to tin- sli what he begun, were unintelligible. About noon however, ho said finite dis tinctly, and with some force: "I know that my Redeemer liveth." During tho day ho recognized various people, his daughter many times, the members of his household at Chappaqua, M. John R. Stewart and Mr. Reid. On tlio whole ho sullcred little and seemed to have no moro than tho ordinary restlessness which accompanies the last stage of dis ease. During the day his extremities were cold, and there was no pulse at Uie wrist; the action ot the heart was very intermittent and constantly diminishing in lorce. uc nan not asked lor water or been willing to drink it since his stay at Dr. Choate's, but during Friday he asked for it frequently, and up to within halt hour ol the end tic manilestcd in various ways his consciousness of what was going on around him, and even an swered in monosyllables and intelli gently questions addressed to him. About null past three he aaid verv dis- linclly : "It is done," ami beyond the briefest answers to questions, this was his last utterance. His younger daugh ter, Miss Gabriollo, was with him through Thursday evening. Through out Friday tho elder daughter, Miss Ida, was in constant attendance as she had been during tho whole of h:s illness, and Mrs. Greeley's before him. Other members of his Chappaqua household were present with Mr. and Mrs. Jno. R. Stuart and a few other friends. Noth ing that science or affection could sug gest was wanting to case the last hours. The wintry nights had fairly set in when tho inevitable hour came. With out sleighs were running to and fro bearing' to Chappaqua the nearest tele graph station, the latest bulletins which thousands of anxious hearts in the grout city near by kept demanding. Within, tho daughter and a few others stood near the dying man, wiio remained con scious and seemingly rational and free from pain, though now loo weak to speak. In tho adjoining room sat. one or two more friends and physicians. At leu minutes before 7 o'clock the watch ers drew back in reverend stillness from tho bedside. The great editor was gone in peace, after so many struggles in honor, after so much obloquy. The Press dispatches nnnounco the wreck of the steamship Dalmatia, from Liverpool to tho Mediterranean.

Both Houses of Congress met on Mon day. At 1.10 p. in. tho President's uies sago was received and read. Wo pro- sent a synopsis of tho document: It commences with tho recognition of tho blessings which tho American people havo enjoyed within tho past year, tho only exception being tho great' tiro In lloslon. Jt refers to tho General Ami (ration and its satisfactory results, whirl) left tho two Governments, tho American and English, without a shadow on their friendly relations, which it is sincoreh hoped may lor over roniain unclouduij It recommends tho immediato creation of a board of commissioners lo decide on tho amounts to bo paid to individu als for damages incurred by tho Confed erate privateers. It compliments Hon amines r mucin Attains, ino American Arbitrator at Geneva, and Mr. Itancrolt, Minister nt Berlin, for their earnest set vices in the matter of tho Geneva and the San Juan Arbitrations, The decision In tho latter leaving the United States for the first timo without any question as to the disputed bounda ries. In regard I o tho fisheries and to our relations with the Ilrilish Norlh American Provinces, the President says that he has received notice that tho Iiii- pcr:al Parliament and tho Dominion Government havo passed laws to carry tho provisions of the Treaty of Wash ington into operation, and he, therefore, recommends a legislation of Congress in the samo direction. He speaks of the friendly relations 'of the United Stales witli all the Governments of Europe. Ho refers to the Vienna International Imposition, recommends the fitting mi of two national vessels to convey the goods of exhiblors to Trieste and sug gests thata proposition be made to have the next great exposition in this coun try in 187li, at the time of tlio Centennial Celebration in Philadelphia. 

CUBA. He refers to the disturbed condition of Cuba, and says that no advance to wards pacification in that island has been made, while the insurrection had gained no advantages and exhibited no more of tho elements of powcror pros pective sncces'i than a year ago. Neith er had Spain succeeded in repressing Hie insui reclion. Tho parlies to the strife were standingin the same attitude as for along time past. Tho continua tion of slavery in that island he regard ed as among tho strong causes of the continuance of the strife, and he thinks that, the abolition of slavery and the institution of other reforms tliere, could not fail to advance tho restoration of peaco and order. It was generally to lie hoped that tho present liberal gov ernment of Spain will voluntarily adopt that view. OUR 

FINANCES. He gives details of tho revenue re ceived in the past year and ol tho re duction to the amount of over one hun dred millions of the public del)!. He expresses a doubt whether any further reduction in taxation is practicable for the present and ho recommends that no more legislation bo made on that subject except to correct errors of omission or commission in tho present laws until sufficient timo has elapsed to prove (but it can ho done and still leave sufhcient revenue to meet the current expenses, to pay interest on the public debt and lo provide for the sinking fund, lie suggests, also, that the currency shall be as soon as possible brought to a par with UOlll. 

IXTKKNAL IMPIIOVEMENTS. Ifc says that various enternrises tvill be brought to the attention of Congress lor the cheapening of tho transporta tion of produce from the West to the Atlantic sea-coast, and suggests that steps should be taken to gain nil availa ble information to ensure equitable leg islation. In this connection he refers favorably to the proposed route to con nect tho Mississippi Valley with the At lantic ntCharlstoji and Savannah, by way of the Ohio ond Tennessee River, also to the proposed extension of tho Kana wha and James River Canal and Hie Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and to the proposed canal around Niagara Falls. He says that thcro should be'an almost continuous system of land locked navi gation from Maine to the Gtill'of Mexi co, nature having provided a greater part of tho route and tho obstacles to bo overcomo being within tho skill of engineering. , OUB NAVY AND COMMERCIAL MARINE He calls attention to the weakness of tho American navy and endorses th re commendations of tho Secretary of the Navy in that respect. He recommends subsidies for steamship lines to Brazil and between San Frencisco, New Zea land, and Australia; also an increase of the salaries of the bends of bureaus. Ho favors the abolition of tho franking privilege and recommends a modifica tion of its existing evils. Ho alsoi'c commends the adoption by congress of tlio best method of acquiring tilie to al I telegraphic lines now in operation, and of connect ini l lint service with the pos tal service. It is not probable that the subject can rcceivo proper considera tion at this session, but ho thinks t lie movement might bo iniatiated so that futuro action may be had fair to the government. Secretary Iioutwell's Report. The Treasury report says that neces sity exists for a new issue of national bank notes. The Secretary exonerates Assistant Treasury Ilillhouso from neglect of du ty in the stamp division defalcation in the Assistant Treasury at New York. The Secretary again reccom mends Ihe passage of a bill to amend and consoli date the navigation and customs collec tion of the United States. As the lead ing pursuits of the country are now stronger than ever before, in the posses sion of ndeqnato capital and a supply of inlelligent laborers there may be a mod crate reduction from lime to" timo in the rato of duties as the diminishing expen ses of tho Government shall permit without cither Alarming that or injur-! nii; i a nor. He says the circulation of the banks 'fi',0"ld bo fixed and limited and that , " .' ? 1c."a", '.,0 v" V10 ..OI Vr lishcd by law should remain in tho Trea sury Department. A degree of ilexi bilitv in the volume of currency is 09. in vin iikiiivii 1, JLIIIII UIU llllllin UliVU sential for two reasons. First, the busi-J ness of the Department can not be trans acted properly if a limit is made and the power to raise tho circulaliou abovo or! reduce it below that limit Is donted. Secondly, there Is a necessity every uti lumn for moving tho crops without de lay from tho South and West to tho seaboard that they may bo In hand for export and consumption as wauled, The problem Is to find a way of Increasing tho currency lor moving tho crop nud diminishing it onco when that work Is done. This is a necessary work and in asmuch as it can not he confided to the hanks tho power should bo reposed In tlio I roasury Department. Believing that the country is not pre pared lo sustain the policy of couliac lion the Secretary considers tho means by which tho value of oureiirreiicy may be improved. 1 he basis ol a policy of Improvements must bo found in a slur dy refusal lo mid lo the paper in circu lation until it is ol tlio samo value es senlially as coin. Tills being accepted as tlio settled purpose of the country, there can be no permanent iucreaso in Ihodil ference between paper and coin, and an opportunity will he given for the Influ ence of liatural causes, tending upon the whole to a better and sounder finan cial condition. All legislation limited in its operation to the paper issues of the (lovcrniiieiit, whether bearing inte rest or not, and which in ilsellocis shall tend to diminish the market valuo of coin, will he found upon analysis lo contain a plan for contracting the vol ume of paper currency, and all legisla tion so limited which 'does not contain such nplau will prove ineffectual. I ho Secretary, without proceeding to the discussion of the general subject of resin g specie payments, thinks all will have been gained that is of value, when the treasury shall be prepared to pay lliedeiiiand notes of the Govern ment in coin.'and tho hanks shall be pre pared lo pay their notes either in coin or legal lender notes, mid then our good lortuno will clearly appear in this, that our jiii per currency is not exclusively of National Bank notes, norexelusively of United Slates notes. Important Stamp Knit. A suit was decided in tho United States District Court at Jellerson City, Missouri, which all'ccts nearly all the ail roads in the State. It appears that the bonds issued bv many counties to ailioads have not been stamped accor ding to law, and the United States brought, suit to, enforco tho penally. The suits against Jackson and Buchanan counties were made test cases. The de fendants demurred on the ground that as public corporations the counties were not chargeable with intent to evade the law, and were therefore not proper par lies to u proceeding of this kind. The demurrer was sustained by Judgo Kre kcl and the suits were dismissed. Loyal Claimants. The New York Tribune says a host of loyal Southern claimants will be in Washington this winter begging Con gress to pay them for property destroy ed by the Union army during the war. Tho House was hist spring disposed to consider these claims with some favor, and a bill ordering the payment of one of the claimants was passed by tho Sen ate as well as by the House, but was vetoed by the President. As the next Congress will probably bo moro un favorable to such claims as this, wo may expect the doors of tho Capitol to be besieged by these pcoplo from tho day Congress meets until it adjourns. American .Sunday School Union. Tho following summary of the work performed by tho American Sunday school Union tlio past six years, in Ten nessee, will certainly commend the Un ion to'tho confidence and liberal sup port of the religious community: New Schools organized 280 Teachers in the samo 1,72!) .Scholars " " 14.731 pchools visited, aided, addr'd 5)41 Teachers in the same 4.f)!)f! Scholars ". " 4I,:4. Families visited 3,7ti!) Iiibles and Testaments distr'd 3,000 Sermons andaddr's delivered l,4:j; An Honorable Exception. The Philadelphia Press closes an elo quent tribute to the memory of Horace Greeley in these words: "Wc do not conceal our sorrow at this untimely and unexpected calamity; but we are consoled in ono respect at least : that in tho struggle which has cost the nation its greatest and purest journalist, though on tho adverse side, we treated Horace Greeley as a friend and gentle man. W e resisted his aspiralions to our best ability, but never wrote or spoke a syllable that was poisoned bv person al abuse, or not accompanied by the wannest triuutes to Ins integrity, bis capacity, his patriotism and his genius." Music In tho Air. The Richmond Whig, discussing the "Policy of General Grant," arrives at the conclusion that "ho must ignore all parly before ho can have the confidence and support of the whole country; and if ho cannot do this lie had as well turn over the government to Morton and Ihe rings and go nt once lo Long Branch and take his ease." Tho New York Herald commends patience, and says: "Thcro is music in tho air, if we may take t lie wavering in the regular repub lican line as any indication thereof. Chattanooga Items.

Judgo Merriuioi. is Selected Senator 1 from North Carolina, receiving S7 votes 1 to Vanco's SO. I Washington News. Wo clip from tlio correspondent of tlio Courier-Journal of tho 2d: In tho Senate tho attendance was small. Mr. S ii tn ii ci looked nearly as well as usual, and created a sensation by of fering a resolution to striko from the army register mid Hie regimental flags all allusion to Ihe battles of tho Into war. There Is no probability that the Iladi ciils will allow this to'pass. Mr. Wil son and others cllect much surprlso at it introduction. There Is a lobby hero struggling to have ship-building materials mado free of duty. They say Iho measure will restore the American shipping in three years, and are ready lo provo'it over a hot t lo of champagne to a member of Congress or any other man. The indications are that tho Senate will not follow tho liberality and leni ency of the House in dealing with the Greeley Republicans. Tho feeling to wards'theui is very hitler, and in the case of Mr. Trumbull it is intense. Ho is to be removed from tlio chairmanship of tho Judiciary Committeo unless he resigns. Tlio Commissioners appointed to ex amino Iho Not thorn Paciliic railroad arc expected to make a 1'ormidublo report of the road on Tuesday next.

Tho common-places of tho messago were listened to witli little interest, and at one timo tho speaker had to restore order. As was expected, Gcnoral Banks ask ed to bo excused from further service on tlio Committee on Foreign Itehilions, relerring lo Ihe tact he was no longer in full political sympathy with the ma jority. Butler and lilly-etght other Itadicals voted to get rid of him ; but tho House ruled otherwise. A Haunted School If oust;. They have a "haunted"' school-house in Newbury port, Mass. Ihe last edifice in tlio world about which such disreput able noneseii.se should be promulgated.; There nro tho usual raps ; latches are lifted, and doors are rattled, and one day "the pale face of a boy was seen looking through tho window between the entry and tho school room." The teacher opened the door leading into the entry, when a boy who appeared to a pupil a yearsiiico dead was seen gliding up stairs to the utile. Tlio teacher follow ed, overtook the apparition, and "grasp ed it wilh such force that her nails left their prints in the palm of her hand; but she found herself grasping a mere shadow, which gradually vanished.'' Of course people visit this seminary in crowds, and we aro told that, a school committeo are to havo an investigation. Greeley vs. Public Opinion. Wasiiixoton, Due. 1.

Hon ace Ci: 1:1:1. ky. A Good Conductor. Such cases as tho following are rare enough to deserve a general recogni tion : Mr. John Maxwell, a conductor on the Pennsylvania railroad, has been in the employ of the Company for 20 years, and no accident has occurred on his train. He obeys all orders, and is one of the most obliging men on the road, A correspondent speaks in high terms of tho services he has rendered to the company, and says ho is deserving of suitable recognition at the hands of the Company. Not Much Difference. The Kansas City Times is responsible for the follovt ing : The season for "broken rails and no body to blame" is now at hand. This recalls a dialogue we heard once last winter between two profane Chicago men who were going to bed in a sleep ing ear on a certain railroad that runs into St. Louis, and on which there had been a number of Occidents. "Well," said one, "we nro certain of one or two events we shall wake up either in St. Louis or iu h 1." "Yaas," drawled the other, yawning, "but then tho dif ference isn't enough to mae a man lose Iii3 sleep thinking about it." Disgusted. The Indianapolis Journal, an admin istration organ, protests against the pro position to run Gen. Grant for a third term thusly : "Tho country has reason to bo dis gusted witli those super-servieeablc Re publicans who nro gabbling about re electing Grant for a third term, and who actually seem anxious to place them selves on record in favor of the project, if indeed so ill-timed and misshapen a suggestion can bo called a project." Trunk Itailway. The tendency of railroads at the pre sent day is to consolidation, and the ef fect upon interior cities is generally of a damaging character. These consolida tions result in discriminations against tiicm, ond their only remedy is ono or more local railways owned and con trolled by them and thcro citizens, who, having tlio power to do so, can compel the roads to discriminate in their favor.
