LOCAL ITEMS. Day of Prayer.?The House of Bishops ofitlic Episcopal Chnrch iu the Uuited fetates having determined to unite with the Church of England aud all her branches and dcpeudeii 0169 iu the .observance of Friday uext, the -Oth instant as a.day of special prayer and supplica tion tor the success of the missions ot the Church and ior the incr< a e of the ministry there will be extia services held in all Episcopal churches in this city and throughout the coun try on that day. The day was set apart tor this service some time a>;o by the Archbishop ! of Canterbury, the Primate of the English Church at the-'request of the venerable ,kSocie 1 ty for the Propagation of the Gospel," aod so soon as it was kubwn in this country that such a day was to be observed by the Anglican Church, there was a wide spread .desire mani fested among the clergy and laity of the Epis copal Church to unite in the observance aud hence the action of the House of -Bishops as stated above. Yesterday iu all the Episcopal churches iu the city uotice was given of the special service, and the people were earnestly urged to devote the day, asfar as possible, to acts of devotion and to unite in supplicating the Divine blessing upon the missionary effort of. the Church and to implore the Divine Ilead of the Church that He wo.uM send forth more laborers iuto Mis harvest. The gatherings for prayer next Friday will not have the character of missionary meetings. '1 he special object of the occasion is uot for the support ot mis sionaries, but for interceding before Almigh ty God for an increase of the gilt of His spirit aod of His hbssirgs upon the work. The reasons' given for setting apart a day of intercession bef >re the close of the year are that the reports of the missionary so cieties bear testimony to the fact that the prin cipal stations are calling for additional laborers; that the general advanced state of many ot the principal missions has made it necc&jary to provide ministers of high attainments and spe cial gifts to meet present necessities, aud that everywhere all things seem to be in progress towards some great event. The intermingling of the heathen and Mohammedan with Christ ian nations; the upheavings ol the most solid foundations of social systems; the altered posi tion of the lloman Catholic Church iu Europe; these and many other siiiusof the times have it is claimed, produced upon the minds of Chris tian>s generally a solemn impression that we are on the eve of events foretold iu prophecy. The service prepared aud set forth for next Friday iu allKoiscopal churches is in the form of moru iug prayer the usual exhortation, confession, absolution, ver.sides and coileets to be followed by special prayers. KiVEll Xi:\vs.?'The ice is pretty well broken up, but as there has beeu uo wind to carry it off, the river is still blocked up with it as low down as the V\ hite House. Most ot the river steamers have, however, recommenced their trips, aud should the preseut weather coutiuue for a day or two longer, navigation for sailing vessels will be unobstructed. A tow of seven coasters and three oyster boats arrived up last night, aud otie of four coasters aud three oys ter boats this luoruing, all of which, with the exception of two oyster boats that stopped here, went on up to W ashington. '1 tie schooner Geuerat Grant, heretofore reported cut through and sunk a- Bryan s Point, has had her inasi.*> cut away by the ice. A Latleau belonging to a colored man named Smith, sind loaded with furniture, is reported sunk at Sheridan s 1 oint. The schooner I). B. Woife, heretofore reported ashore iu Washington's Reach, has gotten off aud gone on down the river, but was run into by a three master and hud her mrdusail earned away. The sloop reported ashore oil St. George s Island, and whose cargo of oysters was brought ut> bv the steamer G< orgearma, has goitcu oft. During the gale that blew her ashore a colored boy aboard of her i"ll overboard and was drowned. A tow bound dowu from \\ ashing ton yesterday parted <Giesboro , some tour or five vessels got adnlt iu the ice, and on- ot them, au oyster boat, was uiu.-hed and suiik. Her crew aud the vessels adrift were hi ought to this city by the Washington ferry boat. The Maryland lorry boat, \ lrgiuia, this rnoiu iug resumed her tiips that have been suspend ed for a week past, and the steamer Wawaset will resume her trips to Curriotaan to morrow morning.

I he Georgeauua, for Baltimore, also left this alter noon, aud it is said will make but oue more trio this winter. The E. C. Knight, tor 2jew York, also left this afternoou. The Columbia, from Baltimore, due yesterday evening, arrived this morning. A fleet ot about ti l teen vessels is reported between here and Indian Head. Four coasters and three oyster crafts were tow ed down yesterday by two tugs. Christmas at St. Mary's Church.?In view of i he disgraceful conduct of some ot those who attended the services at St. Mary's Church at4a. hi., last Christmas, it has been deter mined to admit uo one, this year, without a ticket. The members of the congregation are always glad to see persons who do not agree with them in religion, at their services, but they cannot tolerate laughing, talking and other improper behavior in their church ou the most solemn occasions; and aa there seems to be uo other way of preventing it, they have adopted the plan mentioned above, bach pew holder will le furnished with a uutuber of tickets equal to the seats in his pew, and a committee to be announced hereafter, will give tickets on'application, to the rest of the con gregation, and to such other respectable per sons as may desire to be present, seats being provided for them in the galleries and vacant, pews. Thus, all who attend will have com fortable scats, and those who come to worship God will not have to witness conduct which would disgrace a theatre. As, improper con duct seldom takes place during the day, tickets will not be required for the later Masses and Vespers. C. tfc 0. Canal.?The Georgetown corres pondent of the Baltimore Sun says: "The president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company has fulfilled bis promise of keeping open the canal until the latest period pussible in the season. Notwithstanding the ice, boats have with the aid of an ice breaker, managed to work through,but caual commerce wiil cease absolutely next week and the water be drawu oif the upper levels. The ice breaker has been sent up the caual aud will bring in all boats now due." ? ' Rki.H!!OL*s Skkvioes Ykstkrpa.y.?The ser vices in the several Churches yesterday were at tended by congregations of the u-ual size. Ow ing to the indisposition of the pastor no service was held in the Second Presbyterian Church at night, liev. Mr. Black occupied the pulpit of the M. E. Church at both the morning and evening services. Kcv. Dr. Sparrow preached in J the morning at Christ Clurch. The pulpits of the | other Churches were tilled by the resident clergy. The following is a report of the w< rk done dur ing the day by the Yountr Mo? 's Christian As sociation: The Mission Sabbath School on the lvishwharf had its usual session of in-arty work and interest At the Jail the usumI interesting' exorcises were held. The Alms ll-mse services wore again largely attended, with a lair com mittee at work; the exer.-ise- were of the usual fervent character. The Sunday Prayer Met ting in the Methodist Protectant Church was one uf the largest ever held by the Association, and in point of interest rarely equalled. The speakers on the occasion appealed to the unconverted; special prayer was made for the recently con verted, and the lover- of Jesus present were re quested to remember the work at this season, and the revival work in the Chuieht-s in their Vravers. This prayer meeting will be held next Sunday in the liuptist Clureh. Attention is culled to the notice of the Su perintendent of Gas. 1KOM
