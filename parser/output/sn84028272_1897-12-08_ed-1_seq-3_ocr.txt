SHARP REPRIMAND. Fall Text of the Rebuke Administered by the Secretary of war to Capt. Covering, Washington, Dec. 7. Secretary Alger yesterday made public the reprimand administered to Capt. Covering by sen tence of court-martial, as follows: By order of the president, the proceedings, findings and sentence In the case of Capt. Lot i-ring. Fourth infantry, are approved. It Is. however, disappointing that an offense so grave and an example so far reaching as this should have been visited with so light a penalty. There Is no question but that Private Ham mond deserved punishment for his conduct, but he should have received It in a lawful way. The military laws governing the army are ex plicit. They prescribe the duties of officers and enlisted men, with the penalties for their violation. Under them, both have rights and obligations. When, therefore, an officer with the intelli gence and experience with which Capt. Cover ing Is oredltei, not only violates these laws, but exhibits such a lack or humanity as la shown in this case, he should receive a more severe sentenoe than a mere repiimand. Committing auch ants degrades the officer more than the soldier he punishes and shows unfitness for the oare and command of men. Under excitemeut men frequently do things which In cooler mo ments they recall with sorrow and regret, but this case Is aggravated by the fact that after weeks of deliberation this officer evinces no re gret for his wrongful acta.
