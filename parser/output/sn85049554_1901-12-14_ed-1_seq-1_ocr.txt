VOL.XXVH 9en. Bruce Hamilton Surprises and Captures an Armed Force of Boers, Makes Long Night March and Pounces Upon Gen. Viljoen's Laager. Frightful Death Bate Shown by Returns Flom Boer Concen- 1 tration Camps. tendon, Dec. 14.—Kitchener reports to the war office: "Bruce Hamilton, af­ ter Ions night march, surprised Plet VHJoens* laager at dawn of December it Witkraens, twenty-five miles north of Ermelo and killed sixteen Boers and captured seventy-six armed prisoners: Many others were wounded *nd were left at the farms. He also re captured one of Benson's guns, the oth *r having been destroyed. Two field cornets were among the prisoners." Sec­ retary of War Broderick wired the gov­ ernment's congratulations upon the brilliant achievement. London. Dec. 14.—The delay in the publication of the November returns from concentration camps, issued to day, was apparently due to the govern ment's desire to accompany the an Bouncement of the pitiably high death rate with some kind of official explana tion. The blue, book, issued today shows 8,156 deaths of whites in October, ©f which number 2,833 were children iWi 2,807 deaths of white in November, of which 2,271 were ohlldren. This tnakes the total number of deaths In the last •iz months 13,942, or a death rate ap proximating 253 per year per thousand Among colored persons there were 1.308 deaths in two months. The blue book contains the government's plans for breaking up the camps, as recently out lined in the speeches of War Secretary Broderick. Wafe* Secretary Brodclck and reports or medical officers blame the death rate on the filthy habits of the Boers, conceal ment of diseases, feeding babies on meat and heavy dough bread and black coffee, and the admission to the camp Tf half-starved refugees riddled with disease. In one instance of aTaatch of refugees brought in there were eight iroiibund cases and three bodies. The national anthem has been revised In order to make it accord with the new ^monarchy. As it present sung it reads: "God save our king." This, apparently, •was not imperialistic enough for the present court, besides which the word "gracious" was held to be more applica ble to the queen than the king. So at the coronation the refrain will be changed to "God save our lord the king," which, by the' way, was used in the ekrllest extant copies of the anthem, dated 174S. 

OFFER TO ARBITRATE. Uncle Sam Tenders Good Offices to Avert Argentine-Chili War. Washington, Dec. 14. The United States has tendered its good offices In the crisis now pending between Chill nd the Argentine Republic. The fact )ias not been made known officially, nor will it be for obvious diplomatic reasons. Whether the mediation of the United States would be effective or not depends Upon the countries In Interest. This country will not act In the controversy unless both countries accept its offer un qualifiedly. Representatives of each of thS coun tries were at the state department yes terday and talked with Dr. Hill,assistant secretary of state. The controversy is one Involving both the question of treaty rights and a more complicated Sue involving the boundaries of the countries. It appears that while the ,status of affairs as affecting the two na tions is a serious one, the assurances of *fsterday show there is not the immi nence of war that has been indicated by press reports. The claim is made that Chill has ,shown great patience and forbearance. In the present controversy with Ar gentina a treaty between the two coun tries is Involved. It is one which pro vides for the neutrality of a strip of country and a water course now a part Of the Argentine Republic territory. Chili has claimed that Argentina was fortifying the neutral strip contrary to treaty stipulation. Argentina, on the other hand, has denied that such a con dition exists, and explained that the op erations complained of are simply those of civil engineers engaged In the pre liminaries to an extensive railroad project. This simplifies the controversy for an arbitrator. There is an inclination to drag Into the existing differences an old boundary trouble. It i* believed foreign governments will take our action In good part. In view of the recent temporary occu pation of a portion of the isthmus of Panama and a prompt withdrawal of our forces, the United States has shown its good faith in dealing with the south ern republics. There is no disguising the fact now that the foreign nations were considerably exercised by our landing troops at Panama and Colon. 

TERRITORY OF JEFFERSON. Congressmen Are Urging Legislation for Indian Territory. 'Washington, Dec. 14.—Much activity is being shown by Congressman Moon, of Tennessee, and other democratic members in the house in the advocacy of his bill for the creation of Indian Territory into the territory of Jefferson.! Judge Moon is the ranking member of! the minority on the house committee on territories and says that he will press his bill vigorously. He argues that there is urgent need of legislation for Indian Territory, on account of the existing conditions. Delegate Flynn, of Oklahoma, had a conference with Judge Moon today on the situation in the territory. Mr. Flynn not opposed to the measure offered 'fe. by Judge Moon, but is urging hip bill for single statehood for Oklahoma. He has had a number of conferences with members of the house and the senate over his measure and lias explained at length the provision of his bill which makes It possible for counties of the In dian territory to be admitted to state hood with Oklahoma as rapidly as they are organized. He is opposed to any proposition looking to single statehood for both territories and is pressing lus arguments upon those who are making an investigation of the situation. Mr. Piatt, of Connecticut, who has shown special interest in the territorial ques tion, has indorsed Mr. Flynn's plar for the final union of the territories, and other members of both branches of con gress have approved it. The advocates of a territorial fornn of government claim to be gaining many converts, and It is said that most of those who are now working for separate statehood will finally be induced to sup port Judge Moon's bill for the estabish ment of the territory of Jefferson. Sam Powell, of Wagoner, I. T.. and Harvey Maxey, of South McAlester are using their efforts to secure territorial form of government for the Indian terri tory and to leave the question of ndl vidual statehood or union with Oklaho ma to be settled by future events and legislation. ACCEPT DEWEY'S VIEW Senators Generally Adverse to Starting a Congressional Investigation of Schley-Sampson Controversy— Dew ey's Decision Likely to be Accepted by the People. Washington, Dec. 14.—Secretary Long has before him for review the report of the Schley court of Inquiry, which he Is carefully reviewing. The question has been raised how far Dewey subs ribed to the opinion expressed in the first re port and in the findings by appending his signature, that signature being re quired of him by regulations, regardless of his Individual opinio— In response to a questiur. on the point the |udge advo cate general of the navy says: "According to naval practices, by af fixing a signature to the report express es full concurrence in all the findings of fact and opinions reached by the court, except those with respect to which he has, In terms, signified dissent in his minority opinion." Opinion in the senate Is divided'as to the probability of congressional inves tigation of the Schley controversy, but is upon the whole against such a course. The majority of republican senators ap pear adverse to opening the question there. This view includes the friends of Schley. Democratic senators gener ally seem disposed to wait upon the expression of opinion by friends of Schley, altho all declare they are will ing to vote to atlopt a' resolution ntfttlng confidence in the admiral. Reprcsenta tice Pearse, who represents the Mary land district from which Schley came, stated today he would introduce reso lution in the house for congressional In vestigation of the Sampson-Schley af fair. Other representatives were seen as to the probability of congretslonal investigation, many holding the coun try would accept Dewey's view as con clusive. THE CATTLE ARE DYING.

If these proposials are refused by the Argentine Republic, Chile will make no further propositions. The refusal of the Argentine Republic will be taki.'n as In dicating that that country desires war. The newspapers here publish bulletins assuring the public that all matters be tween the two countries will be honora bly arranged. British Views of Canal T.-eaty. London, Dec. 14.—The two leading weekly reviews, altho they both sup port the government, adopt curiously different tones In discussing the Hay Pauncefote treaty. The Spectator thinks that all statesmen and diplomatists con cerned In the matter deserve the great est possible credit for the wise and sympathetic handling of the problem, while the Saturday Review, after a ref erence to Senator Lodge's speech as a clear proof of t'/ie complete nature of Lord Landowne's surrender to the United States, goes on to say: "If the history of diplomacy has shown anything it has proved i:he abso lute helplessness, of broad principles and wide Implications In dealing with un scrupulous politicians." Row at Santiago, Cuba. Santiago de Cuba, Dec. 14.—The in dependent party held a great demons tration here last night in favor of Gen. Bartolome Masc\ their candidate for the presidency. A orowd of negroes num bering several thousand gathered out side the building In which th3 meeting was held, and with their cries of "Viva Palma" made It Impossible tor any one to hear the speeches. The police'were unable to disperse this assemblage. The Independents aver that the ma^or of Santiago encouraged this disturb ance.

Commander Clover Says United States Navy is Inferior. Washington, Dec. 14.—Commander Richardson Clover. United States naval attache at London, reached Washington yesterday and called at the navy de partment. He expressed some Interest ing views which are quite likely to at tract considerable attention at home and abroad. He is among the best informed officers on naval matters in Europe. He said that the British naval force is much stronger than anybody has any Idea of, and that our own navy is, in comparison with most of the European naval powers, greatly Inferior and of practically little consequence. "The habit In Great Britain Is to be rate and belittle the navy of that coun try, and this policy is, In fact, encour aged by the British admiralty. It serves to deceive foreign observers in regard to what Is being done and as to the navy'fl real efficiency. "The British navy Is equal In strategic strength to any other two continental powers who make any pretense to sup porting navies. I have known men of the admiralty to employ placard men to parade the streets making comparisons of navies to the detriment of the British service. This excites popular apprehen sion and interest in that subject. It has had this effect. "There are no serious defects In the British navy. Of course, they have their troubles, but they do not amount to anything and the naval authorities do not get Into any such distressed frame of mind as described by the dally pa pers. The navy league over there and the pres3 seem to be party to the great conspiracy. Our policy is quite different. We are willing to rest content with what we have and have led ourselves Into think ing that we amount to something as a naval poweri We would stand no show at all In a conflict with most of the Eu ropean nations, and we ought to get over the absurd notion we have In re­ LAST EDITION* 5 O'CLOCK.

Field of Popular Subscription Left En tirely to the Association Organized to Erect a Monument at Canton—Con gress May Authorize a National Me morial at the Capital. Cleveland, Dec. 14—Judge William R. Day, ex-secretary of state and president of the McKlnley National Memorial As sociation, has issued the following statement to the public adopted by the trustees at their meeting in Washington, Dec. 7th: The McKlnley National Memorial As sociation was organized by the Imme diate personal friends of President Mc Klnley to afford an opportunity for the people of the United States to express their personal love and devotion to the late president by the erection of a fitting memorial at his grave. The trustees were appointed by the president of the United States, the first meeting for or ganization having been held at Cleve land, Oct. 10. It is the distinct purpose of the association to erect such a mem orial as will fittingly typify those exalt ed qualities of character, simplicity, dig nity, devotion to duty and'high Ideals that were so eminently exemplified In his life and purposes. T^his memorial is, to rise above the groye at Canton, Q.. where he will finally rest In accord with his own expressed wish. In bringing the purposes of this Asso ciation before the people, the earlier work has been necessarily one of organ ization. This has progressed rapidly and satisfactorily. It is desired that an organization be perfected in every state and teritory, and local organization In cities, towns and rural districts, with a committee in charge working in connec tion with the state auxiliary is* urged. The public should be given the fullest opportunity to subscribe. The trustees desire to express their deep sense of obligation to the press of the country for its earnest support thus far, and to recommend that all news papers act as agents for the receipt of subscriptions. By a resolution passed by the Ameri can Bankers' Association, all banks have been cteslgnted depositories for subscriptions. All postmasters will re ceive and forward moneys, and all ex press companies will Issue money orders free of charge, and, when necessary, forward money free. In foreign countries the ambassadors, ministers and consuls of the United States will receive and forward sub scriptions. In every case the name and address of the subscriber should be forwarded to the treasurer, Myron T. Herrick, Cleve land, O., for preservation In the perma nent archives of the Association, and in Oder that souvenir certificates may be sent to each. The souvenir certificate adopted by the trustees will be worthy of preservation as a work of art and as evidence of the holder's participation in the erection of the national memorial. It has engraved upon it a portrait of Pres ident McKlnley and. In shadow, pictures of the president's home at Canton, the capltol and white house. The public is especially cautioned against any enterprise attempting to make capital out af the sentiments of affection which inspired the desire to rear at the grave of our late president a memorial which shall fittingly honor hir? memory. It Is the desire of the trustees thnt all contributions shall be the free will offering of the people, and they re spectfully request the public to dis courage all propositions which may seem to have as their object the obtain ing of money by giving all or part of the proceeds to the memorial fund. The public is hereby notified that the Mc Klnley National Memorial Association has no connection with or relation to any other association or to any enter prise of a commercial nature. After a conference at this meeting with the representatives of the William McKlnley Memorial Arch Association of Washington, the following resolution was adopted: "Resolved. That it be the sense of the trustees of the McKinley Memorial As sociation that the field of popular sub scription should be left to It for raising the sum necessary to provide a. suitable memorial to the late president at Can ton. where his body lies: and that this association should Join with the William McKlnley Memorial Arch Association of Washington In memorializing congress to erect a national memorial at the capltol of our country to commemorate his services to the nation." The Arch Association acquiesced in thlB resolution and has-properly ceased to solicit popular subscriptions, leaving the field to the McKlnley National Me morial Association, thru which the peo ple of the United States will build a memorial of affection at the last resting place of their beloved nresldent Wil liam McKlnley. Notes of Discord Heard About State Fair Natters—A Sug gestion. Horticulturists Want Iowa to Spend Some Money for An Exhibit. Judge Given Altho Old in Years I Will Again Practice Law. Special to Times-Republican. Des Moines, Dec. 14.—There were several notes of discord heard during the past week of agricultural meetings. "If the state agricultural department is to sell the cool under the fair grounds," said a well Informed observer of things in general yesterday, "I would suggest that the board be required to turn the money into the state treas ury. Then I would have the legis lature make a change and elect the directors, one from each congressional district, instead of allowing the elec tion to be made as at present. I would provide for minority representation on the board. There are proportionately about as many real farmers In the leg islature as In the gatherings that select the directors. At present the board does about what it pleases with the funds on hand. I would have the money go into the stnte treasury like any other funds of the state. They have asked that their department be made a state department. Let it be made so in fact and only at one end, leaving the other loose. Let the money be paid out in warrants the same as any other money of the state. Or put the matter of construction of build ings under the board of control and have the work done as carefully there as in any other of the state Institu tions. I can not see why we should be so indifferent as to the use made of money realized from the coal belong ing to the state and other ways, and yet exact such strictness with the educa tional institutions. For instance, here we have the whole state set at sword3* points because one of the heads of a state college Incurred some expense while appearing before the state legis lature on request, and yet these men connected with the agrlculaural and hortlculaural societeles come to Des SJjjSfres and have their railroad fare paid and hotel bills paid by the state of Iowa, and then put on a little more for good measure, in addition to a liberal per diem. I do not find that the board of control has any power to go over the books of these societies and make sugestlons as to the right way to use public funds. Why not make of these societies real state de partments and treat them exactly as state Institutions?" Such a movement would meet with strong opposition at once, but it may be said safely that a large number of members of the legis lature are considering the matter. The horticulturists have assumed that the legislature will this winter provide for a suitable board to look afjter a proper exhibit of Iowa at the Louisiana Purchase exposition. The commission which Governor Shaw called into existence some time ago seems to have realized its utter inabil ity to accomplish anything for the Iowa exhibit at St. Louis ostensibly to contract for space for an Iowa build ing. But Iowa may not spend a lot of money in a building, and the committee could do nothing more than ask that a certain space be reserved for Iowa until after the legislature meets. An other committee of the commission was named on publicity and promotion and to make the people of Iowa familiar with the plans of the fair. This com mittee has done nothing at all. But is assured that a commission will be named, clothed with the power to secure an Iowa exhibit and the horticultur ists are going to make a demand that on that commission there shall be at least one man who is especially Inter ested In horticulture, and especially in pomology. This has not been done at previous expositions where Iowa has been represented. It Is expected that if the frlut growers are granted the right to name a man for the commis sion they will name M. J. Wragg, presi dent of the state horticultural society, who Is also a director of the state de partment of agricultural society, who is also a director of the state depart ment of agriculture and superintendent of the horticultural department. Then the live stock interests will want a man on the commission, and the manu facturers will demand representation, and the mining interests will want something and the school and educa tional interests will be asking a place— which leaves the prospect of places for the merely politicians very poor Indeed. There are 23 lawyers In the senate and 25 In the house. There are but 7 farmers in the senate and 22 in the house. In the house there are 14 bank ers and a in the senate. There are 4 editors In the house and 2 in the senate. Nearly all professions are represented— one druggist in the house, a cigarmaker in the house and an ice dealer.

The county will also have several other candidates for appointive po sitions. Dr. J. I. Gibson, of Denison. has been In the city this week attend ing the agricultural meetings and also looking after his chances for reap pointment as state veterinarian. The place will likely go to P. O. Koto, but the appointment will not be made until spring. The Des Moines coal mine owners are not pleased with the news of a movement to merge the coal mines of Iowa Into the combination controlled by Morgan and others. They say they will fight the matter to a finish and that the combine can not get a footing In the Des Moines district.

New York, Dec. 14.—According to a decision handed down by Justice Law rence in a suit brought for the purpose of obtaining a construction of the will of Cornelius van Shalck Roosevelt, who died In New York In 1887, Presi dent Roosevelt, who Is a nephew of the testator of the will, will inherit be tween $100,000. and 1150,000. Cornelius""Van 'Sfirtfclc TWwreve!t v'who lived In New Jersey for a number of years before he died, left upon his death an estate valued between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000. ThQ estate consisted, of be tween $400,000 and $500,000 In personal property In this city and a great deal of real estate in this state and New Jersey. Mr. Roosevelt left a will dated March 6, 18S4. The suit brought against the estate has been pending for a long time. The testator bequeathed to his wife, the aunt of President Roosevelt, and who died last year, all of his property In trust. The trustees and executors, under the will, upon the death of the widow, were obliged to pay certain annuities out of the estate. The fourth clause of the will, the provision under which the president, with his brother and sisters and cous ins, will receive considerable sums, reads as follows: "On the decease of my said wife I do devise and bequeath nil my estate, real and personal, subject to the pay ment of the said annuities, to my nephews and nieces, Alfred Roosevelt, W. Emiline Roosevelt, Mary E. Roose velt, Leila Roosevelt Schuyler, Theo dore Roosevelt, Anna L. Roosevelt, El liott Roosevelt, Corinne Robinson, wife of Douglas R. Robinson John E.

Roosevelt, and Frank Roose velt, to be divided equally between them, share and share alike and I do declare and direct that no part of my estate shall in event pass to, or be paid over or received by Cornelius Roosevelt or his issue, and I hereby exclude him and his issue from having or receiving any part of my estate." Four nelces and nephews died after their uncle, the testator, and their in terests will pass to the heirs. Short Telegrams." S. L. Hall, a sewing machine repairer, was found dead near Eufaula, I. T.

[Atlantic Monthly.] The newspapers, with all their faults, are among the most constant aids to the vigilance which is the price of the lib erty that is protected by the courts. Who believes that the police, the prose cuting officers or the judges would en force the laws and respect private per sons as well as they do now If the eye of the reporter and the pen of the editor were not at the daily service of every voter? The occasional pettifogging of attorneys is a necessary evil, Incidental to the conservative power by which the legal profession upholds and tests the law as it exists, and exercises a fore sight gained froim history and informed by present business. Yet sharp practice is kept in check by the fear that It will be reported. In England, In the reign of James II., there was not a word in the Gazette about the trial and acquittal of the sev en bishops who had dared to tell the king that he was not above the constitution. It Is better to tolerate the worst news paper in the United States than to have a censorship of the press. We have to take some risks, and our people prefer the risks of freedom of speech. They who abuse it by foolish declarations lose much of what influence they have by the Indifference or ridicule with which our people are accustomed to treat absurdi ties and those who publish criminal suggestions are more easily watched and taught in their earlied career than they would be if our government required them to be more secret. Indeed, the peo ple of the United States do not know how to do without freedom of speech. The repressive policies of other govern ments, judged by their effects, are not alluring. The more open and fearless way Is the better \yay for trying to give every human being his share of truth and right, as well as his just portion of punishment. We can not escape suf fering of some kind, and we are learn ing that no tests are too severe for the ages In their development of the high est types of human character. Until Individual life shall not need to fear exposure, publicity will be the dreaded weapon of public order as well as of private rpvpnge. And It Is Impossible to foreteif wl*»n publicity will not need to be subject at least to the restric tions of .our existing or futoi* !«•(, THE
