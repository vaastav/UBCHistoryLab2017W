Fannie Elsslcr, the celebrated dnmcer, is dead. president Arthur has sent in his last message to Culamurcaa. The ticket ecilpers anda ticket agents are at war in New Orleans. The railroad rate war, brought down the fare between St Louis and Chicago to fifty cents. President Arthur extends the hospitalities of the White house to President elect Cleveland while lreplaring for inauguration. The Soewing Machine business does not appear to be as good as it was a short time ago; the Singer Co. shut down, and now conimes the Howe Co. with the same perform wu0ee. The Live Stock division of the 1xposition, have issued a catalogue I of premiums for stock. The list is a very liberal one, but it ought to have been issued six months ago at least. Ti e democrats have not control of Illinois Legislature after all. The news that they had was a little pre vious. The Governor, to whom the matter was referred, decided in favor of the republicans. Cjapt David L. Payne better known as Oklahoma Payne died suddenly at thie breakfast table of the hotel De Barnard, Wellington i amsas Nov. 28, He was alpar ently in the best health ahen he entered the breakfast room. A. H. Murphy, a keeper of tihe New Orleans workhouse was killed on the street Monday. lie had charge of a gang of prisoners at theI time. Judge T. J. Ford and his brother Pat Ford are charged with the killing, An official report on the Panama can.l says; When the work is fin fsbed and the river Chasgre has ben turned from its source the meeost arduous part of the munder. taking will be over. Which is no doubt a fact. Two ear loads of thie Iowa exhlibh it bfor the Exposition were wrecked last Sunday, and were reported to be a total loss, thus preventing lowus frons making an exhibit. This was a mistake as many of the goods in the wreok were uninjured, auI it takes over eightecen cars to sorry Iowa's exhibit,. THE

R. R. The management of this road, have at last settled down to work, and the raising of the road bedal is! in progress. The part west of Dlelhi - will be attended to first and then the section between D )elhi and I Delta - will be raised. A train lhad of con victs, and their llulnder went west - last Saturday, and early in January tIO convicts are expected to be at - work. S'The plan of raising the sectionl R of road between lhelhii atl Monroe I - first, would seem at tirst sight to be, a sort of hind part before ar - ralngeent. awl the tonlly collllOll sense view to take of it is, that the company is satisfied that the levees ' 0now up, together with those Ieing! put up, will insure the east end of the road fromt overflow. On lno other ground can the idea of fixing , the west end first be rea:sonablyti supposed to be the proper thing. Previous to this year, thile laill trouble, has been between Tatlu lab and Waverly. Between those l points the water was deeper, on1 the track, than anywhere elte on e the road. The Canal hayou swamp has Luae tho place where the water was deepest. Just west of Lake t One was another bad place, and from Tensas, about four miles east, at ,was another bad stretch, and final s ly from half a mile west of Tensas, (Henley bayou) nearly to Waverly, the track was under during every 0 overflow. For these reasons, at 0 the first blush, the east end would e appear to be the end most requir ing attention, but the building of Ashton levee changed the appear tance of things, and now, if the levees alrealdy up, hold, all the water from the Mississippi that comaes into North Loutsiana albove Delta is shunted off west, and goes through the country west of bayou e Macon, whlich is therefore the first e section requiring attention. S Railroad companies are not given 0 to sentiment; they are enunentiy t practical, and the very fact of their devoting their first efforts to the hlighest half, of the part of the road Sto be worked on, is a strong argu e nient in favor of safety from over Sflow for this part of the parish. a The company evidently have con n fidence in the levees, they evident ly believe this end of the road will Sbe safe front overflow, and the ex d ample set by them, is a safe one to follow. So get ready for a crop year, exercise faith, and go ahead. lPROCEEDINGS OF THE
