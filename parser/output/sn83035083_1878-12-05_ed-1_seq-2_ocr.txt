The city of Cleveland has a debt of $8,400,000. Tt was mostly contracted during the days of inflation, and the idea of the gold-bugs is that it is just as easy to pay it in hard-pan times. The Montgomery (Alabama) Ad vance is a Democratic paper. Its edi tor is James A. Scott, a colored man, and good work he did during the late contest for the Democratic ticket. Over two millions of acres of new lands were taken up in Kansas by set tlers during the year ending June, 1878. Surely, " Westward the star of empire takes its way." The Legislature of Georgia re-elected Senator Gordon almost unanimous ly. He received every vote in the Sen ate and all but five in the II o use, those live being Independents. The Cleveland Herald and some of the other Republican papers are sug gesting the name of Majah McKinley ae the candidate of their party for Governor next fall. So, it seems Hon.

Resumption is to take place on the 1st of January, a little less than a month from now, and then if any one Who baa 'worthless,' 'dishonest rags' and wants to convert them into glit tering gold he can jnst pack them up aud go to Washington or New York, the only places where they arc pay able. Ok Friday morniBg last, Dr. Heyl who was on trial at Zanesvllle for body-snatching, asked leave to with draw his plea of not guilty and enter ed a plea of guilty to the four indict ments against him. Evidence has been obtained against him showing that he has been engaged in the business for some time, aud that some seventy bodies have been shipped by him to a prominent Eastern medical institute. The fact that Governor Hampton re ceived 100,000 majority at the late elec tion in South Carolina is urged by the Radical politicians as evidence that the result in that State was brought bout by fraud and ibtimidation. But then they should remember that there was no Republican ticket in the field and Hampton's majority was substan tially the entire vote cast.

It is a lengthy document, altogether too long for us to put in type at the late hour at which it came to hand. It contains little that is new or that was before unknown to the country, in regard to the views of ! Mr. Hayes upon the great questions j which have claimed public attention for the past year. It is regarded by j the friends of Mr. Hayes as rather a weak and common place affair, and those who expected to see him go back upon his Southern policy mani fest great disappointment at its tame ness upen that subject. A TVashing- ton dispatch says: "The Republicans j do not regard it as a document which I will aid them politically, nor the Dem ocrats as one which their adversaries can get much comfort out of." We are within four weeks of re sumption, and everybody is looking forward to that important event with intense anxiety. Shermau and the goldites feel confident that if nobody wants coin and the greenback aud bauk notes are not sent home for re demption there will be no difficulty j in maintaining resumption.

The case of Matilda Hart, adminis tratrix, against the receiver of the At lantic & Great Western Railroad, which has been on trial at Warren since last Wednesday week, was given to the jury at noon Tuesday. Last Wednes day a verdict of $1,000 for the plaintiff was rendered. The damages claimed were $10,000 for causing the death of Ira Hart, who was killed while at tempting to cross the track a half mile west of Warren station on the 2d of last February. There is trouble in the Senatorial families at Washington over the pros pect of their having to recognize the colored bride of Bruce, the colored Seuator from Mississippi. Etiquette prescribes that when the wife of a new Senator, or new wife of an old Sena tor, goes to Washington, the wives of other Senators shall pay her a social visit. The high-toned ladies of the capital revolt at the idea of calling up on a colored lady, aud it is reported have held a conference with a view of changing the social law- Out upon such nonsense. The recent death of Colonel Walton Dwight, at Binghampton, N. Y has caused considerable excitement among the life insurance companies. Within three months provious to his death he had succeeded in securing policies in favor of his wife and son to the amount of $253,600. It is the theory of some insurance men that Dwight intended, when he took the policies, to be a dead man before the next quarter's premium became due, because he was financially embarrassed, and it would have been difficult for him to raise $3,000 necessary to pay them. Old Peter Cooper is the father of Edwin Cooper, Mayor of New York, and father-in-law of Abraham S Hewitt. Both Edward Cooper and Hewitt are hard-money men, while Uncle Peter is soft on the finances. A carrespondent says the son and son-in-law have had many discussions with tbe old gentleman ou finances. The old man was accustomed to say to his friends. "Now, these two boys of mine meaning his son Edward and his son-in-law, Mr. Hewitt are smart able and very intelligent in everything but this money question. But when ever this question comes up they talk like boys ten years old." The old man's head is level. The money-value exchanges at the New York Clearing House lor the year, ending October 1st, amounted to twenty thousand millions of dollars. In all this value only nine hundred and fifty millions of dollars were alc ually handled. The inflation of paper creel i ts thus amounted to over nineteen thousand millions of dollars. Yet the very fellows who practiced this infla tion are the loudest howlers against the inflation of government credits in the whole land. It might probably in terfere with their own system of in flation. Compromised. The Tiffin Advertiser of last week makes the announcement that O. C Zellers, the absconding Cashier of the National Bank of that city, has settled with the bank and is about to bo al lowed to return to the United States. The amount of Zeller's embezzlement from the bank was supposed to be about $46,000. Of this sum It is said that John T. Norris, who was the first to discover the whereabouts of the ab sconding Cashier, obtained $15,000, of which sum ho was compelled, to pay the Bank $10,000. E.T. Stickney.who was bis bondsman for school fHnds, recovered about $10,000. lie gave to his attorneys in Ctuada aud other parties $10,000, of which sum it is re ported Norris got $2,300, He has giv en up all his real estate, and all that he has to shew to-day is but about $6 -800, and his lost reputation. The Bank will realizo about $30,000 out of Its compromise. Norris aud his con federates will have about $7,300. The Advertiser says: ''Zeller has been nearly squeezed dry. He found that his wealth took unto itself wings and has flown away." Repkesentetive Foster " appre hends" that Congress will pass a bill repealing all sections of the revised statutes which provide for the , appoint ment of supervisors of election, but that it will not be passed as a direct proposition in the Senate, The only danger he apprehends of the failure of collision stopped the machinery, dui the Appropriation bills is that tl.eDem-1 force of the wind and the hcad : ' o,i i .ho ,ivii .

About a quarter to one o'clock on ' the night of the 24th of November the Hamburg American line Steamer Fomerainia, Capt. Schwenaon, which sailed from New York on the 14th ult., for Hamburg, and arrived at Flymouth at midnight ou the 21th, collided during a dense fog, with the Welsh bark, Noel Eiliin,of Carranoon, from Rotterdam lor Cardiff in ballast, about eight miles south of Folkestone. The Pomerania at the time was on her way from Plymouth to Hamburg. The steamship foundered in about ten minutes after the collision and from fifty to sixty of her passengers were lost. Among the passengers was Louis Lauman, of Akron who gives the following statement of the occur rence : " We had a capital run and got to Plymouth about 3 in the morning of the 25th iust. We landed some pas sengers and took some for Hamburg, and then ran tor Cherbourg and land ed the passengers, nearly all of whom were cabin. Those left were mostly between decks. The crew consisted of 111 men. We have hero at the Sail or's Home 172. I waaiu bed last night about 11 :45 o'clock when I felt a sud- den bump as if the Pomcrnia had struck upon a rock. I was alarmed, but I did not think at lu st that it was anything serious as we had kept a good lookout and the Captain appear ed to be very careful. It was his 126 voyage, he had told us. Ho celebrat ed his 125 when he was last at Ham burg. A few seconds after the collis ion tbe steward aud some of the crew came rushing to us and said a sailing barque had run into us and we were all to go on deck, and I went ou'deck directly and saw our ship's light, but tbe fog was so great I could see noth ing else. But they told mo the barque had run away. The crew were then all busy lowering the boats. The ship was beginning to sink. In lowering the boats there was great confusion, everybody trying to crowd into them. One boat filled and sank immediately after it got into the water, and two others were smashed by collision. The boats were fastened np tight and we could not get them undone. The Pomerania was sinking rapidly. There were a number of women among the passengers, I don't know how many, but eight have been saved aud a baby. I think the baby's moth er Iras been drowned. Our captain had some fireworks on board and let them oil. We managed to got into the boats that remained and had been there about ten minutes when the steamer Glengarry picked us up. She cruised about a long time. Our cap tain had a chance to save bis life, but would stick to his ship. I saw him when our boat got away from the steamer, standing on the bridge giving commands, trying to maintaiu order aud Rave as many as he could. In twenty minutes after collision the Pomerania went down. She did not keel over but went down gradual ly. The ship which ran us down I never saw at all. They told me she was a sailing barque, and that with a north northeast wind, she camo bowl ing along and ran right into us. I thought until we lauded we had run upou a rock as the Schiller did. It was very thick weather. There was a good lookout on the Pomerania all the time. She had smart sailors, and had two men on the bridge, aud two fore-part from the time sheneared the channel. Our boat was so crowded it was nearly even with the water. Terrific Boiler Kxploslon. A special from Unioutown, Pa., dated the 29th ult., to the Enquirer, gives the following account of a terri ble disaster near that place, by which six men were killed and seven others seriously wounded : " The boiler explosion yesterday afternoon at the coal works of Reed Bros., near Dunbar Furnace eight miles below hcre,turu3 out to be worse than wa3 at first supposed. At the moment of the explosiou two men were instantly killed, and one died within an hour; two more, John Mowey and Joseph Vayone, died last night, and the sixth, Morgan McGill, this afternoon. John Dougherty, the pit boss, is seriously hurt, and his re covery is considered improbable. Sev en other men aro suffering from wounds, scalds aud burns, but none of them are thought to be latally injured. The disaster occurred in this way : Eight men were on the roof of the boiler-house, and with the assistance of a number below were erecting a new smoke-stack. The steam pene trating through the roof annoyed the men above, and Vayone, the yard-boss, ordered the escape-valve to be closed. This was done, and within two min utes the boiler exploded with terrific force. Daniel McGarvey, the engin eer, was thrown a hundred feet in the air, and one hundred and fifty feet distant, into an adjoining field. He alighted on his head in a beaten clay foot-path, in which his head half bur ied itself. The force of the fall rup tured his abdomen, and let his entrails ont. John Mowey was scalded to death. His flesh was cookad until it was so tender that his abdomen burst ed under the distention of his stomach and bowels, and these organs pushed themselves to the surface. Richard Evans was killed by a bar of iron striking him across the forehead, and imbedding itself in his brain. Wayne died last night and McUill this alter noon from internal and external in juries. The boiler was toru into shreds Hardly a fragment as large as a man's hat can be found. Of the boiler-house nothing can be found, except here and there a stick of wood. The general demolition could not have been more complete. With the exception of Mc Gill, all the killed leave large families. Reid Brothers arc bearing all the fu neral expenses." Itivcr IMsnwtcr. Nkw Orleans, Dec. L The steam er Charles Morgan arrived to-day from Cincinnati. Her officers report that at 4 o'clock this morning a collis ion occurred at Bringier's Point, op posite Doualdsonville, between the Morgan and the Cotlou Valley, of the Red River Transportation Company line. The Cotton Valley sauk and twenty lives were l06t. The boat and cargo are a total loss. The Cotton Valley left here yesterday for Red River with a full assorted cargo and a number of passeugers. When the collision occurred the wind was blowing a gale and the raiu falling in torrents. The Morgan was coming down, the Valley going up, the boat rounding a point.
