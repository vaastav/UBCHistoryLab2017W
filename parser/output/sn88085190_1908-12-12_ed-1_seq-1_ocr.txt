It apparently does not occur to them that the collector of cus tom 3at Port Townsend and the Treas ury Department at Washington know i a good deal more about the necessity and convenience of an office here and \ the worK done here than they do. i As a matter of fact, while the receipts i of the office are not large, there being comparatively few importations of dv ! tiable merchandise, the pore ia one lof the most important of the smaller 1 ports of the district and is growing in importance each year. Although I the present year haa been a rather ] quiet one in most avenues of business, there have been between forty and fifty 1 foreign entrances and clearances of I vessels here, besides quite a number of ■ entrances and clearances coastwise — Ito and from Alaska points. For the latter no fees are charged. There have also been a large number of reports ;of small '.-raft going to and coming from British Columbia points—prin j cipally Victoria and Sidney. All are j required to report at the customs j house but no fees are collected from I vessels of less than five net tons bur den. There have been numerous en tries of merchandise and commercial products, most uf them free of duty, and receipts from various sources have amounted to some hundreds of dol lars. Exports of domestic products during the year have amounted to many thousands of dollars in value and imports also have aggregated a considerable sum. There are frequent changes of masters of vessels and chances of documents and numerous admeasurements of vessels for the ascertainment of tonnage. For these services no fees are collacted. No measurement made and certified by the deputy collector here has ever been changed or questioned in any respect. Previous to hi 3 appoint ment in the service in this county the work was done at other ports, prin cipally at Port Townsend. or officers 1 were sent for the purpose whenever < occasion required, which was seldom. las few boats large enough to require ' measurement were then built in the county. Friday Harbor was made a sub-port \of entry by order of the Secretary of the Treasury during the latter part of October. 1900, and the office was open ed for business Nov. 1 . Mr. Culver was not an applicant for the position of deputy collector, but the appoint ment was voluntarily tendered him by Col. Huestis, then collector of the district and one of the most capable and honorable men who has ever been in the government service in this state. A strict disciplinarian, ab rupt, direct and outspoken, he is one ; of the most kindly, generous an<l just men whom it has ever been the privi lege of the writer to know,. When !he left the service, because of ill health, the employees of the district made him a present of leather cover ed furniture valued at several hundred dollars, before bis administration there had been many charges uf cor ruption and incompetence in the dis trict and its reputation was at a low ebb. Since he took charge there has been a vast increase in the volume of business,and no district in the United States has had a higher rating in res pect to honorable aad efficient admin istration. He was aucceeeded by Hon. C. W. Ide and he by Hon. F. C. Harper, who served together as members of the state senate in the early nineties. Like Col. Huestis they are "teetotalers" and men of the strictest integrity, highest moral character and fine bus mess qualifications, who are most highly esteemed by all who know them, either in public or private life. It has been the good fortune of the deputy collector here to serve under them all and so far as he knows not the slightest complaint relating to bin official work has ever been made against him. The Valley Presbyterian Church is in excellent financial condition and a most gratifying spirit of liberality and helpfulness is being displayed by the member* and others who at tend the services there. A special contribution jost taken for the im provement fund brought in f 60. Dr. McKinnis made a business trip to Seattle the first of the week. Chief Points of the President's Message Following are the leading features of President Roosevelt's message to Congress, submitted last Tuesday: The Constitution gives tv the gov ernment the paramount rgiht of con trol over all corporations doing an interstate business. All corporate combinations of cap ital for business pursuit should be made legal by substituting a new feder al law for Sherman anti-trust law. but bring all such combinations un der absolute governmental control, making the abatement of abuses the prerogative of the executive, rather than of the judiciary. Absolute divorce of interstate oor poratious from stock gambling by es tablishment of governmental control of issues of securities, by enforcing publicity, simple methods of ao coun.s, etc. Abolition of all rebates and special privileges. Short term franchises for all cor porations engaged in public business, particularly those using water power. Place railroads absolutely under the control of the Interstate Com merce Commission and so enlarge the powers of that body that it will be made thoroughgoing. Control by the Interstate Com merce Commission of all issues of railroad securities; arbitrary control ani regulation of ali rates and con trol of all traffic agreements between systems. Give to guiding genius of railroads just due of wealth, but abolish pos- The Condition of Governor-Elect Cosgrove Side lights on Gov.-elect S. G. Cos,rove's condition, his life nt Paso Rubles, bis visitors and his surround ings, are given in a column and a naif special dispatch in The Portland Oregonian of last Monday, that paper having sent its San Francisco corres pdndent .to Paso Eobles Saturday night to reconcile the conflicting re ports regarding Washington's execu tive-elect. As summarized, this staff correspondent reports the following findings: Access to Cosgrove is absolutely denied everyone except the physi cians. Mrs. Cosgrove, Mrs. Roy Kin near, who is his daughter, and her husband; C. S. Young, an old college friend, and Bamford A. Robb, of Se attle. All office seekers and Washington politicians have been met at the hotel lobby by Mrs. Cosgrove, and politely but firmly told that there was no chance to see Cosgrove. When Cosgrove goes to his steam bath in a wheel chair, he is closely guarded from any one who might ad dress him. Mrs. Cosgrove says his one ambi tion is to get to Olympia. for the in auguration, and that he would instant ley begin talking politics to visitors with deleterious effect. There appears no likelihood of this retqrn, however. He has not respond ed to treatment. "He sleeps better than when be came, but has shown no improvement so far as the disease itself is concern ed." Mrs. Cosgrove herself said. He has been taking two baths a day, but Friday he missed altogether. So he did yesterday. His doctors have stopped talking. Doctors Sawyer and Dresser shrug their shoulders when questioned. "Bnght's disease is always dan gerous." they said. Outside rumor goes farther. Cos grove is said to have told his mas seur: "111 not live much longer and you'll not have to bother with me many days." Bamford Robb said : Seeds For Apple Trees The apple for propagation is usually raised from seeds obtained from oider mills. These are sown in autumn in broad drills and they remain in the seed beds from one to three years ac cording to the soil. When the seed lings are a little more than a quarter of an inch in diameter, they are taken up in the spring and planted in nur sery tows. The trees are budded the following autumn. Apple trees whan transplanted to or ohards should bare been budded for two years. They should be six or seven feet high and have a proper bal ance of bead or side branches. sibilities of using railroads in stock gambling operations and huge swin dles upon the public. Premiurp upon individual initiative bat control of principle of individual ism in business. Cry of "State Rights." when rais ed in connection with the centraliza tion in the central government of the power to deal with centralized wealth, is not sincere, but is raised by those who oppose governmental control of interstate corporations and stand for absolute and unrestrained individual ism in business. Bring telegraph and telephone com panies doing interstate business un der control of Interstate Commerce Commission. National and state control of all natural resources. Men who produce and find market for that which is pro duced should have far greater share uf wealth than at present. Working men should be interested in the cor porations for which they work and produce. Practice of issiung ex-parte injunc tions should be greatly reduced. Few cases in which there is excuse for such procedure. National laws to protect wage work ers in the employ of incorporations and the government, when injured in such employ, or worn out in service. Increased salaries for judges of fed eral bench recommended. Recommendation for postal savings banks and a limited parcels post re newed. If he doesn't go to Washington soon he may not be alive to go in January." He is barely able to move from his bed to bis wheel-chair. Some days he is moody : others bright. He fluctuates much. He has been eating cornmeal mush and toast, with hot water. Now. however, he is on liquid peutonoid alone, by Dr. Dres ser's order. Mrs. Cosgrove absoluttsly denied the reported deal with Gov. Albert E. Mead, by which Cosgrove would not return north for inauguration if Mead would concede certain patronage. CoHgrove has dropsy as well as Bright's disease. His baths have been principally hot air, not steam. As the story goes, John S. McMil lin, who registered from Roche Har bor, Wash., was particularly stren uous in his efforts to have a conver sation with Cosgrove, but went away gnashing his teeth. It is worthy of note, also, that the hotel register shows the names of several Seattle and Washington people, since Cosgrove arrived. They are R. C. Graves. D. A. Robinson. W. W. Powers and wife. John S. McMillin, Roche Harbor, S. Hyde. O. S. Williams and J. S. Gra ham. [The statement contained in the above article that Hon. John S. Mc- Millin was a recent caller at Paso Robles and that when he was refused permission to see Mr. Cosgrove, as all visitors are, be "went away gnash ing his teeth," is in all probability a gross exaggeration, to which the leading paper? of the northwest read ily give currency because they are not friendly to Mr. McMillin. Mr. Cosgrove and Mr. MoMillin have been personal friends for many years. If, while the latter was in California on a business trip, he went to call upon his old friend, be was doubtless grievously disappointed to find bis condition such that he was unable to see him, even to express his sympathy and good wishes, but it is not at all probable that he "went away gnashing his teeth."] Although Commissioners Buchanan and Oayoa came here last Tuesday to atteud a special meeting called fur the purpose of considering the peti tion for the incorporation of Friday Harbor, no meeting was held, it hav ing been discovered that the boundar ies described included more than twenty acres of unplatted land belong ing to Jan. F. King. A new peti tion was immediately drawn and it was quiokly signed by eighty electors resident within the described area, the population of which has been as certained to be ot«t 400. It will be presented at the regular meeting of the board In January. ]SO. 46 The Best Apples for The Northwest In an atticle written for the special apple section of last Sunday's Poat lutellitjencer, Mr. Wm. Taylor, pom ologist in charge of Oeld investiea tions, U. S. Department of Agricul ture, makes the following recommen dations as to the varieties of apples best suited to northwestern condi tions of soil, climate and markets: "The planter ut apples in the more favored portions of the Pacific north west should not be satisfied with any variety ranking lower than "r«ry good" in dessert quality. Such showy but unpalatable sorts as "Alex ander," "Wolf River". "Bietigheim er." "Ben Davis" and similar varie ties ought not to be tolerated in dis tricts where "Yellow Newtou." "Eso pus Spitzenburg.''' 'Jonathan.'' ''Yel- luw Bellflower," "Winesap," "Mo- Intosh" and "Rome Beauty" are known to succeed. "Regardless of its beauty, produc tiveness and durability, an apple of poor dessert quality is destined even tually to find a low level in the mar ket. Present indications are that aa production increases and closer dis crimination is exercised by consumers the difference between good and poor apples in the market will be greater than it has been in the past. The exact determination of varieties the relative valueu for particular localities and uses is a task requiring years of careful observation and test and cannot be accurately forecasted. The safest guide to the planter ia the bebavior of the vaieties that are al ready under test in his locality. Bat' for the region in general the follow ing doubtless comprise the best com mercial sorts that have thoroughly demonstrated tneir values: "Baldwin," "Esopus Spitzenberg", "Grimes Golden," "Gravenstein". "Jonathan." "Mclntosh," "Red Canada," "Rome Beauty." "Tompkins King," "Waeener," "Winesap," "Yellow Newton." Of the newer sorts some of the most Dromiaing are "Delicious," "Stay man Winesap" and "Winter Banana." These are well worthy of planting in an experimental way. but until more thoroughly tested should Dot be heavily planted in commercial or chards. Foi the higher elevations, where cold endurance by tree and fruit bads 19 an essential, such varieties as "Yel low Transparent." "Oldenberg" (of ten grown as "Duchess"). "Weal thy. ""Patten Greening" and "North western Greening" may well be plant ed." The State's Loss By Fisheries Decision C. C. Dalton, the commissioner ap pointed bj the supreme court for oar state to investigate the Columbia iiver dispute, says the decision is a great loss in territory and jurisdiction to the state of Washington. It gives to Oregon nearly exclusive control of the salmon fisheries and islands of the Columbia river, and onotber very im portant matter, the control of the pi lotage of vessels on the river, because the court brings the boundary line close to the Washington shore. All of the seining grounds and the great er part of tbe gill net fishing ground* on tbe river are now inolnded within the state of Oregon. Pound net, or trap fishing is not affected by the de cision, exoept probably a few fish traps on tbe south side of Sand island and a few fish traps on some of Uw smaller islands. The dedal on settles the title in the state of Oregon to all tbe island* and submerged tide lands that have been olaimed by both states ever since Washington was admitted into tbe Union. Tbe loss from fish ing licensee will not amount to mom than $500 annually, a part of which was paid to Oregon. Tbe decision settles the contention and attempt of Oregon to enforce the recent direct legislation lawa of that state, regulat ing the fisheries of tbe river to the shore of the state of Washington by the claim of exclusive jurisdiction of all of the riTer .
