Heads ot Departments With Great Care PREMIERSHIP IS BOTHERSOME Difficult to Find a Man to Measure Up siiito Judge Taft's Requirements—None ?{, w- Doing His Own Selecting. Special to Times -Republican. Washington, Dec. 17.—The business of making: a cabinet for President Taft Is hopelessly in the air. The amateur cabinet makers have demonstrated marvelous capacity. They have presented Mr. Taft with a fine array of cabinet material, and have even taken the trouble to arrange it in orders—in fact, in an infinite num ber of orders—for his convenience, Mr. Taft however has not decided anything about the cabinet. This can be said with the utmost assurance of its accuracy. A few points are determ ined but Jthey do not reach to the point of settling any of the personal phases. For instance: The secretary of state in the new cabinet must be a 'tried, skilled and well known lawyer. For secretary of the treasury it is desired to have a man who will have a general and Intimate knowledge of what may toe called academic finance, as distinguished from banking. The knowledge of practical banking will also be wanted. The secretary of the treasury must be a man free from any record or af filiations whioh would associate him with Wall street or any other special interests. Every member of 'the new cabinet will have to be a man who has grown to cabinet .'size and established a cab inet size reputation independent of as sociation with administration In recent years. Material Is Scarcc Material from whioh to seiecc ui« secretaries of state and the treasury is found to be especially scarce Lyman J. Gage came from the presidency of a great Chicago bank to toe head of the treasury. He would not meet Mr. Taft's requirements, and no other man of the Interests and affiliations of Mr. Gage would. Likewise, Postmaster Meyer has been mentioned prominently in all the cab inet gossip as a serious .possibility for the state portfolio. But he does not measure up to the requirement of be ing a great lawyer! James R. Garfield has been discussed as the probable successor of himself at the interior department and it is not to be assumed that he is out of consideration for the post But Mr. Garfield hardly measures up to= the de mand that members of the new cabinet must have earned reputation aside from their relations to latter-day ad ministration. The same applies to William Loeb, Jr., who has been put In all the cabinet prospectuses. In short, it can foe said with entire assurance that Mr. Taft has laid down for himself a few general rules, which, If they shall be rigidly adhered to, will make impossible a considerable number of the men who have been re garded as likely material. Premiership Difficult to Fill The secretaryship of state is a difficult place for Mr. Taft to fill be cause he would like to have a great premier. He would toe pleased beyond measure to retain Mr. Root at the state department. This is now out of the question because Root is to be a senator. The men quite qualified to fill the position, and at the same time to fill the public eye in that position, are few. Senator Knox is one, and For mer Senator Spooner another. Mr. Spooner resigned from the senate be cause he wanted to earn money and he has been earning it, according to all accounts, at a most gratifying rate. He refused two or three cabinet posts while he was in the senate. It is re garded as almost impossible that he would now become premier, at a time when the position entails greater social duties and expenses than ever be fore. Knox Would Do. Senator Knox is another man who would fill the bill for the premiership and the impression gains ground day by day that he may toe the choice. It will surprise outsiders more than his close friends, if he takes the posi tion. It is in line with his ambitions and tastes, and moreover the political situation in Pennsylvania is said not to have been most agreeable to him. He is compelled to be the junior sen ator, with a senior who is the political head of a great machine and while relations between Knox and Penrose have always been excellent, yet the situation naturally is not entirely to the liking of Senator Knox. No Call for Young *Men. Gossip has had to do with a num ber of the young men of the Roose velt administration, as possible of probable cabinet members. It may be doubted whether any one man will be placed in the Taft cabinet whose first claim to distinction and recognition had dated from his relations with the Roosevelt administration. Mr. Taft wants a cabinet of his own of men with ready-made reputations: of men tried and tested, and recognized ts first-class men asidei from any asso ciation they may have had with the recent conduct of public affairs. sf*„ :fei of Roosevelt's Young Men Will Bo Retained in Official Household—Taft i, very likely to be a great surprise to people who with a narrow horizon have been gossiping about the members of a rather obvious group of possibilities.

As soon as the re sult of the election became known a great crowd that had assembled out side the parliament building broke in to cheers, and salutes were fired from the forts and Haitien gunboats.
