Press : The conundrum maker proposes this: "Why is the Ohio Legislature like the mills of the myth ical gods of the ancients?" The ready were mutilating the connty records, answer to which is : Thev grind slow- thus endangering all titles to property so that no man's property was safe for a moment. The following is given as a brief history of the affair : The troubles date as far back as the municipal election in June last. The whites of the city made a desperate effort to redeem the city from the cor ruption that had been going on there for over four, years. The negroes nominated a ticket, composed almost exclusively of their ewn race, and en deavored to carry the election by ex tensive colonization from the country, even going so far as to band them in military organizations. The leading negro, who fills the office of Chancery Clerk, declared in a public speech that the whites would yet be proud to ally themselves by maruTage with colored men, and that, were be not married, he eould easily secure as his wife any white belle in the city. But fer a counter military organization on the .part of the whites they would have been overpowered at this election by the votes of the country negroes. The irritation produced by their proceed ings was further aggravated by the recent discoveries that Davenport,Car doza and Dorsey, all filling important ly. Whether the remainder of the answer "but they grind fine" ought to be given, the revolutions of the future will determine. There seems to be a fixed purpose to reduce the pay of the county officials of the state, especially in the large counties, so that "court house rings" will have less of golden links in them hare now. Seme four or five bills, having for tbeir purpose this end, are pending in both theHouse and Senate. It will require wise action, if no injus tice is done the officers of the smaller counties. Some propose to make all offices salaried, by requiring all fees and costs to be paid into the county Treasury, which will simply result in paying for county work by au unequal tax, the man with or without prosperi ty, drawn into law, paying perhaps largely while his neighbor, more for tunate, pays little or nothing for this purpose. Another plan proposed, is to reduce all fees and costs about thir ty per cent, from the present rates. In order to "deal justly" counties A farmer in Oregon has had a field of sixty cr of grain eaten by rabbits and all of hi other fields have suffered, to a less extent, from their depredations.

Seven frame dwellings occupied by German families at Brighton, a suburb of Cincinnati, were destroyed by fire at an early hour Monday morning. The flames spread with such fearful rapidity that many occupants of the houses were obliged to escape with out clothing, and it was with great difficulty the children were aroused and rescued. records. The Sheriff, who was about to receive $150,000 of taxes drawn from an impoverished people, was also found to have only a straw bond.

It is also believed that the subject will come up iu some way or other before Cengress, and probably lead to a de bate in which many of the issues of the last general election will be reviewed. A bill has been introduced into the Legislature "to permit teachers in rur al districts' to adjourn tbeir schools on holidays and for one week wWcn the Teachers' Institute is in session.". Of course this is a proper subject for leg islation. Nothing should be left to the people of the ''rural districts" who furnish the money to "run the ma chine."' '7 '"' 'i : him -1 Juuue Jso. J.

Tite Fin ancial Chronicle gives de failed re urns of the cotton industry of the Udited States for the fi.-scai year ending July 1, 1874. showing the tollowing results : The cotton lala-ii by Northern mills amounted to 1,1ft. 417 bales; by Southern mills. 12S.526 bales : or a total of 1,305,943 bales. Duriny the year there was atlttvcl to the mill shock 85,000 bales, to that the total consumption of the mills was 1.220,043 bales. The present number of Ifbtton mills in the United States is 847, of which 0i0 are in the Northern States. The number of spindles its 9,415.333, against 7,114,00jin 1800.

By consent of both parties the casewns sent to a referee, with the understanding that Miss Proctor should then testify that all stories al leging criminal i'utimacy between her and fieechijr were false, and thai Moulton should declare that he had no knowledge of their truth, and he should pay all of Miss Proctor's ex penses and ether costs of. the suit. This was done, and the case was then settled.

At a caucus of Republican Senators held the day after the assembling of Congress a discussion on the financial question developed the fact that the lack of harmony which existed at the last session still exists.

One ef the hardest-lessons for young people to .learn is to praetfce economy It i a harder duty for a young man to Southern Appeals to The "Great Father." The country has been afforded two excellent specimens as showing the revolutionary effects produced by Grantism in the South, Both these specimens came from Alabama, where the thieving Federal carpet-baggers haye been mast active. First we had the ''Republican county officers" of Eufaula and Clayton, in Barbour County, calling ou the Federal Gov ernment to send down troops to pro tect them against the "White Leag uers." At the very time that this call from the Barbour County politicians and carpet-baggers was received at Washington, the new Democratic Governor of Alabima was delivering bis noble and patriotic inaugral ad dress at Montgomery, In the course ot which he said "he would regard it as "one of his highest aud most sacred -obligations to see ibat the laws are "Jaiihlully executed, and (he rights of "all citizens, without regard to race or "color or previous condition, duly "guarded and protected." As the election is now over, of course this stupid requestjWhich less than a month ao would hare beu a godsend to Landaule't Williams for Southern-oat- rage capital, was treated as of course it ought to have bceii treated, and the -llepublican officers of Barbour Coun ty" were advised to call upon their own State authorities if they needed protection. The otBer specimen came from the Mayor and Aldermen of Tnscurabia, which town suffered so severely from the effects of the gale the other day. These men sent an appeal by telegraph to President Grant personally asking for immediate relief by the order of a supply of rations" Thus Grantism and carpef-bagaTsm in the South have taught the people ot these two districts at least to be lieve that the present President not only has authority to order the Fed eral army to any part of the Union to protect a small gang of politicians in a bar-room brawl, but that he - abso lutely holds the key of the Treasury, aud can Walk in and take out as much a- he want3 whenever he chooses.

Almost at i.he very opening of the session Mr. KelU-y, of Pennsyjvanii, Kef the ball in mo'ion, iii a speech in advocacy of his 3,!i5 . iti'rcoiivertable bond propo sition, in which he attacked the Presi dent's resumption policy vigorously! and was warmiy supported by Gener al Butler, who, in his usual acrimoni ous manner, pitched info everybody who presumed to differ Irom him. The discussion was ended for the time be ing Try a motion to print made by Mr. pccniriHlate and save his first thousand I .Cox.; but a warm t me. may bo expect- dollars than his next ten thousand. A t ed on the subject belore the close of man can become economical without ' tic session. being mean, ana n is one oi nis mosi solemn duties to ly up sufficient in Jiis days of strength and prosperily to. frovide for himself and those who are or may be dependent on him in the .days of sickness or misfortune. or competent men will hardly under take to do the work now required. Some parts of the state are calling for more judges, for the Common Pleas courts. Before this is granted it is quite desirable that there be an inquiry after the fact ef how much are the present incurnbereuts doing. It ought to be a legitimate question to propose i r Does two hundred days and sometimes less, make a fair year's work ? The Constitution-making disease that broke oat all over the state two or three years since, culminating first at the State Capital, and then stopping over at Cincinnati, for a number of mouths, although seriously checked by the people last August, is showing decided symptoms again in the Gener al Assembly. All sorts of projects break out in different parts of the Representatives Hall from day to day The ladies who wish to vole are in formed that now is the time to press their claims by the voice of petition. Mr. Ramsey, of Adams, having spok en for them, by proposing an amend ment to strike the word "male" from Hie Constitution. The author of this proposition, by the way, is one of the most manly men in the body, old in years but young in heart, keeping abreast the tide of the world's pro gress. "Shall we go home to Christmas?" is a a.uestion wrestled with every few days, and yet unsttled, while the ta ble groans with the motions and countermotions bearing upon this momentous (turkey) question. Very likely in due time, an adjournment will bfc effected, the country and the turkeys saved, while no one's record will be spoiled by voting against an adjournment, and then aneakiug home without leave.

The President asserts, in his mes sage, that the Kellogg State officers of Louisiana had a majority of the legal votes, not withstanding the proof be fore the Senate Investigating Com mittee most clearly demonstrated the contrary, and the Committee, which was composed. mostly of Republicans, were forced to report that the Kellogg Government was a usurpation.
