Tho Spaniards Have Digested President' McKlnley's Message The Final Passaga of tho Cuban Chapter Stumps Them They Sec Through the Velvet GIovo that Strokes Them tiently tho Iron Hand thai May Crash Them Eventually. -r Nkw Yokk, Dec. 12. A dispatch to. Ihe Herald from Madrid says: One decided object has attained by (l... .......-".I.... .. ...... . ...... 1 1 . t I. in ill m iug away of doubt and uncertainty' For days before the message was re ceived the morning press had reported rumors that the message would bo, markedly unfriendly to Spain in char" acter. These rumors the evening pa pers either coutradicted llatly or re peated in more pessimistic terms, just as thoy happened to be favorable or unfavorable to the government. A-1 JNow that tiie message Has been ae livered and digested, it is explained that all parties look upon is with acer- tain dubity. It is the final passage. right to intervene under certain con ditions, that has been most comment ed upon here. This passage, says tho Ileruldo, is the most important of all, and the Heraldo only voice3 the pre vailing opinion. The Imparcial calls it a hint to tha Cuban insurgents to perservere in their present attitude, so that tho American republic may have a pretext for sweeping Castilian influence out of Cuba; while tho Liberal, a paper more, rather than less, favorable, to the pres ent government, admits that it is hard to have to reecive quasi censure from a foreign power, although it argues that both iu form and spirt the messago is favorablo to Spain. The Im parcial goes on to urge upon the government the necessity of immedi ately increasing the navy, so as to bo ready for putting into action the men ace contained in the message, should the war not be brought to au end very quickly. The lasUpoint is the one that gives the ministry the most trouble. There seems no earthly reason why the pres ent guerilla skirmishing should not go on just as longastheCubans concerned in it do not caro to work, as one of the ministers said, that in the hope of se curing the intervention of the United States tho insurgents might avoid a decisive conllict, and remain nominal ly in arms until the expiration of tha time the executive at Washingtor it have accorded Spam.
