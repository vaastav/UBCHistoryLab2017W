L HALE IS A "GOPR" CHAMPION FORGING TO THE FRONT IN THE SIX-DAY CON TEST. SPRINTS STILL IN ORDER. (THE CROWD AT MADISON S(|UARE TREATKD TO SOME FAST BRUSHES. MILLER CONTINUES IN THE LEAD. Waller, in Spite of Desperate Ef forts, Is No Longer v Serious Factor in the Race. NEW YORK!* Dec. B.— At midnight the indomitable eighteen were still pedaling their way, lap after lap, around the high-banked floor of Madi -Bon Square garden. From midnight to midnight Miller had put more than 350 miles behind him. This marvelous rec ord on the third day of the great race carried him along to a total of more than 1,200 miles in seventy-one hours, 139 miles ahead of the former record. During this weary journey Miller has left the track but for a few hours. "With the exception perhaps of Ste phane, the Frenchman, Miller had up to late in the afternoon had less sleep than any otfler man on the track. And. notwithstanding this, Miller is seem ingly in as good condition as he was yesterday, when experts claimed that he and Rice, the Wilkesbarre coal miner, were in the best shape of all the riders. The next man to Miller at the pre^int time is Rice, and he 13 something more than fifty miles be hind. But he is strong and seems to have the same determination that car ried him almost to the front in the big race of last year. After sixty hours of what seemed to Americans to be the fiercest kind of rivalry, Stephane has given in to Ri vierre, and the latter has put more than 100 miles between himself and his fellow countryman. Indeed, Rl vierre holds a dangerous place in the front ranks. He is third man in the race and has a good lead on those be low him. Stephane, Rivierre's quon dam rival, took the sulks tonight, which accounts for his lost ground. He disappeared from the track for a cou ple of hours, and even after that he rode only at intervals. The score at 1:15 a. m. waa: Miller, 1,238 miles; Rice. 1,162 miles; Riverre, 1.127 miles; Schineer, 1,143 miles; Moore, 1,099 miles; Waller, 1,096 miles; Pierce. 1,070 miles; Hale, 1.067 miles; Stephane, 1.02G miles; Elkes, 1,000 miles; Golden, 1,007 miles; Enterman, 9r,S miles; Kinz, 922 miles; Gannon, 932 miles; Julius. 873 miles; Beacon, 718 miles; Gray, 72G miles; Johnson, 671 miles. Miller was ICO miles and four laps ahead of the record for seventy-threo hours. The man to be watched from now on Is "Teddy" Hale, the champion. The "foxy" work hinted at by his friends earlier in the week is beginning to be come aparent. From a despised"*'tall ender" he moved up within the past twenty-four hours until at 8 o'clock to night ha has passed Pierce and forged Into sixth place, with 140 miles between him and the leader. The rivalry be tween the French and German riders ls one of the curious fioatures of the contest. Schineer, Miller and Waller, ■when on the track together, always encourage each other and make com bined efforts to get the better of Riv erre and Stephane, while the French men stick close to each other and coach in their mother tongue.

There were two spills during the night and early morning. Miler's wheel sliped from under him as he was about to dismount and he fell down the incline, but was not hurt. River re fell in the same way without any worse result. Beacon slipped off his wheel to the floor. When picked up he was fast asleep. He was the first of the racers to fall asleep on his wheel. The col ored man. Gray, would have quit dur ing the night had it not been for his trainers. A feature of the race was when early this morning Gray's train ers folowed their man around the track with a stick urging his to "get a move." At 3 o'clock Jimmy Michael, the Welsth rider, made his apearance on the track and the big crowd at once trans ferred its attention to him. Paced by tandems and triplets, the middle-dis tance champion wheeled a five mile ex hibition and covered the distance in 10:25. Sprinting remains the rule on the track, and the great audience that had gathered by 8 o'clock were witnesses of a great surprise in a sprint, in which Julius, the Hoboken lad, was well up in front. Rice pushed around at an even pace, with a sponge cocktail clinched between his teeth. - Beacon was with the sprinters. Riverre was riding alone, reeling off lap after lap at a stady, telling pace in his effort to recover the ground he had lost. Miller dashed about with a huge boquet, the gift of admirers, fastened to the handle bars of his machine. Elkes- left the track for about ten minutes and came in for a great sprint when he returned. Miller passed a century ahead of Schock's record during the sixty-ninth hour. "When the results of that hour were announced, the* string began an other spurt, with Rice in the lead. Muisc still inspires the men to those wonderful feats which have made this match so sensational. Billy Young is a disgusted man. Stephane has disappointed him. He was off the track for two hours and a half. He got off at 7:30 p. m. and kicked about his saddle. Young re paired }*. He went about five laps and then the handle bars displeased him. Gouglotz looked after them. Then he started off again, but came back with another wail about the sad dle post. "I want a shave," was his next de mand. Young was staggered. "You can ride just as well without it," Young replied. "I want a shave," was the sullen response. A barber was secured and after Stephane had been attended to, the rider, mounting his wheel, de clared that he would continue wheel ing until Saturday night. Then young grinned with delight. Gray got back about 9 o'clock and looked fresh as a daisy. He rode in fairly decent style. Miller's work is marvelous. He goes pumping away in a peculiar manner that Is as effective as deceptive and he manages to keep fifty miles be tween himself and Rice, who is push ing hard to close the gap. Waller is making a mighty effort, but it seems a fruitless one, to get back to the front. There is too much ground for him to cover, and if he comes in one, two. three, he will be a. wonder. The short match races tonight were exceedingly interesting and did not have the suspicious apearance that chacterized the performance of the previous night. Arthur Zimmerman rode one-third of a mile in the garden tonight in 41% seconds. Harley David son, of Canada, tried to do Fred J. Ti tus, in a mile scratch race. The Cana dian set the pace, but Titus passed him on the first lap and held the lead all the way thereafter, although on the seventh lap Davidson came near en ough to be alarming. Titus won in 2:14 4-5. E. C. Bald gave a mile ex hibition, doing the nine laps in 1:55 4-5. The pursuit race between Titus and Davidson was of the most exciting character. Titus overtook Davidson after a chase of fourteen laps in 3:20 Just as this race was finished Miler rolled off his wheel asleep. He was raised from the track and in a few minutes went on again. Miller ls very anxious, and earlier in the evening, finding himself locked in his stall where he had been sleeping, dressed himself and pounded on the door until he was permitted to come out. Michael was next announced for a five mile exhibition, but on the first \sfp the valve of the rear wheel blew out and he was called off temporially. Edward Taylore, the French champ ion, then gave a two mile exhibition, paced by Lamberjack.Gougoultz and th "black and white" Olive team. The ex hibition was a very fine one. Taylore's pick-ups were all in good style, and he made the two miles in 4:00 4-5. Michel then got off without a mishap and made the five miles in 10:19 1-3. CHANGING YACHT RULES. St. Paul Yachtsmen Not Satisfied With Former Action. The yachts which bear away the honors in the interlaken races to be sailed at Minne* tonka this coming summer will have to be as fleet cr fleeter than those which captured the pennants at White Bear last summer, and may not hs built on almost any plans or lines, as provided by an agreement which was formulated at a meeting held feeantly by the St. Paul yacthing cammittee, when it waa proposed to gain the concurrence of the Minnetonka sailors In the plan of entirely dis regarding the water line measurement in the construction of new boats. It appears that although the skippers from th* 1 big lake consented to a continuance of the plan now in fores and under which the com peting yachts were built and sailed, thoy did add a suggestion some time back that the present waterline measurement be disregard ed, and a e-ommittae of the White Dear club, consisting of Messrs. C. M. Griggs, H. T. Drake and Walter S. Morton, a week ago, practically made their club a party to the new arrangement. The yacht owners got together at the Abex- THE 

SAINT PAUI, GLOBE- THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, IS9T. deen last night, and after a discussion of the matter, lasting several hours, decided that the departure was too radical, and that the new boat 3, which will surely be built this spring to compete, should be obliged to show their superiority over the boat 3 which have sailed for the club honors in the past seasons. It was decided, therefore, to over rule the action of tbe committee In a friendly way, and the same committee will notify the' Minnetonka men of the change. There Is said to be no doubt that the sailors from Minnetonka will cheerfully assent to It. At the meeting last night there was con siderable informal discussion regarding th* several new boats wbich are in contempla tion, and the opinion was that the St. Paul club will be in every way equipped to meet the fleet new yachts which the Minneapolis men mean to launch when spring comes, , Several of the pennants which were won dur ing the past summer on White Bear were dis played and presented to the owners of tho winning yachts. MILWAUKEE MAY REVOLT. Three Fast Men Suspended by tbe L. A. W. MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. B.— Three of Milwaukee's fastest cyclers were today, upon order of the national racing board of the League of American Wheelmen, suspended for a period of three years from participating In any bicycle races run under the sanc tion of the L. A. W. The action has caused the biggest sensation in cycling circles for a long time. The riders suspended are Her bert H. Mason, Morgan S. O'Brien, Phil Nickel and John McDonald Jr. The suspend ed riders are charged with participating in unsanctioned races at Elkhorn under assumed names and action by the board was taken after a thorough investigation. If the state ment of intentions announced today is car ried out, it will result in a revolt of Mil waukee racing men against the L. A. W., and the introduction of Sunday races in Mil waukee next season. There has been talk of such a movement for some time. Un less there ls some change in the length of the suspensions, or if they are not removed, some of the rider 3 say they -fill lead in the rebellion.

Action by tbe National Trotting Board of Appeals. CHICAGO, Dec. B.— An executive session of the board of appeals of the American Trot ting association, was held today. All the cases that were heard yesterday as well as a number which were submitted to the board by correspondence were discussed. The most important case was the application for rein statement of R. T. Kneebs, who was impris oned in Germany in 1895 for starting a "ringer." Kneebs made a pathetic appeal for reinstatement and after some discussion it was granted as an act of clemency. American Henley. CAMBRIDGE. Mass., Dec. B.— The Har vard Crimson will print tomorrow a letter from R. C. Lehmann, coach of the university crew, upon the proposed "American Henley." He says: "The nearest analogy to our Hen ley would be brought about, if for instance, the rowing colleges of America were to enter crews at the annual regatta of the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen of America. I do not express any opinion as to the desirability of establishing either an American Henley or a general lnter-collegiate regatta. There are obvious difficulties in the way, and not the least of these is the lack of any general desire among American university men for the establishing of such a regatta." Racquet Contest. MONTREAL. Dec. B.— Peter Latham, pro fessional racquet champion of the world, and Perry Ashw6rth, formerly amateur champion of Great Britain, today defeated George Standing and Briggs, the Montreal profes sionals. Score: First game won by Latham and Ashworth, 10 to 13; second game won by Standing and Briggs, 16 to 14; third game won by Latham and Ashworth. lo to 10; fourth game wen by Latham and Ash worth, 15 to 9; fifth game won by Standing and Briggs, 16 to 13; sixth game won by Lit ham and Ashworth, 1G to 4. The total aces were: Latham and Ashworth, 91; Standing and Briggs, 73. Field Trials. DANVILLE, Ind.. Dec. B.— The Indiana Kennel cluib is holding the December field trials here today. Entries are from New York New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Long Island Wisconsin and a large number of Indiana dogs will also take part in the different events. Twenty-five dogs started in the Beagle derby today. Tomorrow there will be a fox chase south of town. This is claimed by visitors to be the ideal fox chas ing ground in Indiana. Tomorrow the trials for all dogs will occur and some excellent sport is assured. The meeting is under ths direction of Robert Houlawell, who has a dozen dogs for the different classes. Boating Conference. ALBANY, N. V., Dec. B.— Capt. D. Mar vin Goodrich, of Harvard: Capt. Frederick D. Colson. of Cornell, and Capt. Payne Whit ney of Yale, representing the boating in terests of those colleges, arrived here today and went into conference at the Hotel Ken mere. The greatest secrecy was observed and it was announced that the result of their deliberations will not be made public until the conferees had reported back to their colleges. They Will Meet. NEW YORK, Dec. B.— After much corre spondence between the respective managers of Jimmy Michael, the Welshman, and A. A Chase, the English middle-distance cham pion, the managers met tonight and agreed to make arrangements, tomorrow, for the match. It is thought from the nature of the conference tonight that articles will be surely signed for one or a series ot races between Chase and Michael.

' ■* Li_ SIX AMERICAN { VESSELS AJtE KNOWN TO HAVE LANDED EXPEDITIONS. i > ili THE DONS THEMSELVES CARELESS. O I*. t * - . i Cuban Coast Less Closely Watched Than That Under the Jurisdic tion of America, WASHINGTON. Dec. B.— Secretary Gage has submitted to the department of state his report upon the action of the treasury department in sup pressing filibustering expeditions to Cuba in violation of neutrality laws, a synopsis of which is as follows: Secretary Gage puts out the fact that during two years and a half six American vessels of an aggregate of 1,331 registered tons are alleged to have successfully landed expeditions from the United States in Cuba. With the exception of the Laurada the six American vessels alleged to have suc cessfully taken part in expenditions in Cuban waters are small tugs and a pilot boat, each of less than 100 tons and obviously incapable of carrying large numbers of men or large quan tities of arms and ammunition. Three foreign vessels of an aggregate of 1,778 tons are alleged to have been success ful in the same effort. Referring to these foreign vessels, the Norwegian steamer Leon, the Danish steamer Horsa, and the British steamer Ber muda, the secretary invites attention to the fact that the crews of these vessels are required to be shipped be fore the consuls of their iespeclive nations in accord with the Jaws of those nations. He suggests that in quiry might be pertinent whether tbe Spanish authorities informed these consuls of the alleged expeditions and whether or not s^me, measure of re sponsibility does i not 1 rest on the Spanish authorities foi* the alleged de parture of these' vessels, or, if the consuls were notified,- whether the same measure ot responsibility does not rest upon them. ..This suggestion is made not to shift responsibility but to show that if these 1 alleged expedi tions started without' the knowledge of treasury officials tljey also depart ed without the Knowledge of officials of other nations whose action was a necessary prelimiiiaryr. to clearance. "With the vessels referred to it !s alleged there have, been associated about a dozen harbor tugs, three or four lighters, a few small steamers and about a dozen small sloops and schooners, in all less than fifty. On the Atlantic and Gulf coasts in ISOU there were 1.666 vessels under 200 tons, and 217 vessels of 1,100 tons or less, a total of 13,585 American vessels of a description and locality available for filibustering purposes. That only six out of 13,585 American vessels suc ceeded in reaching : Cuba, and that less than 50 had any share In these expeditions. Secretary Gage says, is a demonstration -first bfithe law-abiding spirit of the nation and of the obedi ence of the people to the president's proclamation, and second, of a whole sale and repressive fear on the 'part of those who might be disposed to be lawless and violate our obligations as a neutral nation and of a belief that their efforts would be frustrated by the authorities of the United States and that the risk of discovery and punishment greatly outweighed any chance of profit from the exceptional ly high money rewards offered to ves sel owners by the Cubans. "Eight revenue cutters, with crews of 317 men armed with fifteen guns, have cruised 75,788 miles, occupying 160 months in the aggregate, patroiing th.: coast to prevent filibustering expedi tions They have captured seven ves sels and 115 men; have broken up two

Out of the sixty alleged expe ditions only four have been broken up by Spain. Illustrating this statement, he refers particularly to the expedition that left on the Laurada from Balti more and landed at Banes on March 27. Banes is an Important seaport on the northern coast of Cuba, with which the United States carried on a valuable « ARCHITECTURAL IRON "WORK. CONFECTIONERY. MATTRESSES AND IRON BEDS. Roberts A. &. 0.

Several of the other Indians have followed his example. ls prepared to avow the inability or indisposition to defend her interests in Cuba, Secretary Gage holds that the responsibility for the success of this expedition may properly be fixed upon Spanish officials in Cuba, who had been fully informed by the Spanish le gation. The Spanish authorities have repeatedly asserted that all of the sea ports of Cuba were in their possession. Secretary Gage makes no cstimaterof the cost involved, which has evidently been very large, deeming the extent and results of the work performed by the departments a betTer measure of the fidelity of Its officers to their oaths That true friend to all suffering with colds and coughs, Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup, will always help and never disappoint you, as other cough remedies do. and a better standard by which to nuasure their efficiency. WEVLER LIKES IT. Glad He Wan Dree—ad Down In Mc- Klnley'n HeiMge. MADRID, Dec.

Tomorrow the Carlist deputies will meet to discuss President Mc- Kinley's message to congress. It la said they intend to provoke popular manifesta tions against the message. According to a dispatch from Barcelona, Lieut.

CLEVELAND. 0.. Dec. B.— Under an or der from the state board of equalization, the basis on which the backs of this city aro taxed, has been heavily Increased. The tax able valuation of the twelve national banks has been increased $1,151,000 and that of the thirty-six state banks 1273,000. This ac tion Is taken because the present valuation of the banks on the tax duplicates is much lower than that shown by the reports made by the national banks to the comptroller of the treasury. The banks -claim that they are legally entitled to the offsets which have been allowed heretofore, and they will fight the matter in the courts. Episcopal Convention. DES
