On Friday tiro Iron-dads and f eytn Irani ports sailed from Hampton Roads for the fcouth with sealed orders A dmslou commauded bv Gen. Emory Waa on board thalransports. The dltltlon contltta of thn New Tork regiments, I , a PeDnsjlranla regiment, and Massachusetts rrgimem, containing alloy ewicr uiuit iudu imi thousand men. Some of the correspondents at Fortress Monroe say that thla force has gone to reinforce Gen. Foster In North Carolina, bnt It Is not readily seen why the transports need have been accompanied by lroncladi, If such Is really their destination. It had been previously supposed at Forlresa Monroe, that thla force un der Gen. Emory was to form a part of General Banks expedition. The wiseacres who would hare It lhat Gen. Banks was going to Jamea rlTer, begin to doubt whether that extraordinary piece of strategy, with the anticipation of which they have been amusing themselves, la likely to b attempted. Nothing, Indeed, could be more absurd than to aupposeShat the military authorities here, who, not long ago, withdrew Gen. McClellan from the James river, would now stultify themselves br sending Gen. Banks there. That pet scheme of the semi-secessionists of the North, the concentration of our whole mill tary power upon the capture of the worthless town of Richmond, Is foiled. The Administra tion is too wise to listen to such suggestions of folly and treachery. Blows are to be struck upon the further South, where the rebellion Is most vulnerable. That point la' settled by the sailing of Gen. Banks force south ofthe capes of the Chesapeake. Precisely where he will strike, will be known In due time; but our ralth Is strong that he will strike at the right place and strike heavilr. Anywhere rather than at Richmond I From the Southwest we hare news of the success of the expedition from St. Helena undir Gen. Ilovey, in crossing to the left bank, of the Mississippi and capturing Grenada, after com pelling Its precipitate evacuation by the enemy, and the destruction by them of large quantities of stores and of many locomotives and railroad ears. Grenada Is In the line of the retreat of the rebel forces which are retiring before Gen. Grant, and Its capture mu-t compel them to take some other route. It Is not to be doubted that this expedition of On Hover, which comes so opportunely In aid of the operations of Gen. Grant, was arranged in concert with him i At St. Louis, the prevailing speculation i, that Gen. Grant will now strike off southeast erly towards Mobile, leaving the capture of Vlcksbur? tn the expedition of (ten. McCler nand, now about ready to start down the Ml i-elppl. From N'ashrllle we have a dispatch, uuder date of the 7th Instant, announcing a sharp rn iragrment with guerillas In that vlclnlt, in which one of our brigade- under Col. Morris a as captured. The number of men in the brigade is not stated, and may have been smalt, as many of our brigades are reduced below the proper proportions of regiments. ToorTsettlils disaster, we hare reported a handsome repulse of the guerillas who ventured an attack tiHn Geu Frre, at Gallatin UENTEIIN VinuiXIA. To-day, the question of admitting Western Virginia Mi a sovereign State Into thla Union, cornea upln the Houieof Representatives, We ran bnt hope for the complete trlnmph of free dom In tbe recognition of this struggling peo pit fcr States rights. It should be enough to satisfy every Republi can member, whatever may be hit notions of dividing but es.tbat such men as Vallandinfrham go against the proposition. They would for ever tie this people to the ear of human slavery, as they would every free State of this Union. o not with the men who would keep this true and loyal people tied to the Letcher govern ment and to the bastard confederacy of Jetf, Let every member ofthe House, who would now do a good work for liberty, give his vote and his Influence In behalf of this measure. There Is one view of this question which we desire to present briefly. Shuuld the tiiutbern Confederacy succeed, which by the way we do " not admit as a contingency likely to happen,.) inougn ii is among me possiomues 01 ine iu tnre, then it will be Infinitely better that this people should stand as an Independent State In the Northern Union, than that Its territory and Its people should be chained to the dead carcas of Eastern Virginia, which, In such an event, will go with tbeConfederacy,draggingdownto perdition Western Virginia with them. . Let the members of the House contemplate' ever possible advantage and disadvantage I and then let, them act for freedom, confident ' that the admission of this people Is what free I dom and Justice require at their hand" ' MiSStVCBUSETTS RlMEF

Mr. BAYARD thought this Government was especially valuable from Its protection to the citizen. In no other free government was the citizen liable to arrest at the discretion of any and every officer.

There had been complaint that the Government had been too lenient, and that man who had been simply Imprisoned had not been hung or shot. He would like the resolution to lay over.

A bill of this kind should be met with fairness and with all the deliberation the House could bring to Its con sideration. There were a variety of opinions concerning the bill, and It was one besides of great importance. Such a bill might not he necessary! at all to Indemnify the President, as he had only acted In accordance with the pow ers already vested In him by the laws. Never theless, he concurred with Mr. Stevens that a bill of this character was proper under tho cir cumstances. But concurring with him, he would regret above all things to see such a measure thrust through tho House without a moment's consideration. It would be discredit able to the country and to the House ( and for himself, he would be ashamed to go back to his constituents if the bill was passed without debate or consideration. Mr. 

VALLANDIGHAM. The objection raised is not to the postponement, but to making it a special order. Mr. COLFAX Tho motion of postponement belngwlthdrawn.tho question comes up wheth er the bill shall lose the place on the record or be passed at once.

Tho question was tully understood It had been dis cussed all over the land, and It was admitted that all the President had done had been done by the authority of law) but notwithstanding that, he was willing to pass a bill to indemnify the President He had taken the responsibility of sating so before his constituency, and he wouiu take tne responsinuity 01 acting nere. wponslbllltv of acting 1 Mr.

Still, believing with the gentleman irom rew York, (Mr. Olin.) that It would look better to glre time to the House to examine It, I offered to glre that time, but was not permitted.

The bill sim ply provides that the President, the Secretary of State, and the Cabinet, and all who, in pur suance of that authority, hate made arreBts during this rebellion, shall be Indemnified and made harmless. That is the full extent of the bill. He would not vote for a bill with such a provision as that he referred to.

A remedy can only exist where a wrong has been done.

Mr. STEVENS, from the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a bill empowering collec tors, assistants, and overseers to administer oaths, Ac. The subject was postponed.

Mr. RICHARDSON proceeded to review and page of It, he said, was devoted to the negro, while not a word was said about the brat ery, the chivalry and good conduct of the soldiers In the field. No word expressed, no mention made of the maimed, the sick and the wounded no sympathy expressed for tho widows and or phans no w ord about the progress of tho w ar, which could hare been atoided by honorable compromise If the President and his friends had desired so to do. The whole sum and sub stance of the messago amounted Just to this, " take care of the negro." Ay, fight, mortgage the white man and his children for ever, all for 1 lU0. " OI ,u?

We confess to a pretty strong feeling with fltcm In this matter, from what ws have recently learned ofthe facts In the case. The working classes of England are strongly with us against the Southern rebellion. It Is Mc aristocracy lhat favors vcrsA. The common peo ple love liberty and hate despotism, and though, they now suffer for bread, even their sympa thies are all with the North, while the British aristocracy, the haters of republicanism, de sire to see our country overthrown.

It Is said that the native North Carolina troops belonging to the organization streauously Insist on a vig orous and prompt enforcement of the confisca tion and emancipation acts of Congress. Of course tbey do. It takes the Northern men like Richardson, Yallandlgham, Fernando Wood, and John Van Buren, toadvocato the contlnu anceof Blatcry, and thus the continuance of the war. Enlightened slaveholders will very soon see who arc their friend. Many people are anxious to know the desti nation of Gen. Bankss expedition. The pub lic mind, a short time since, rested upon the assured fact that It was bound for Texas. We had as well believe this to be the goal as any other point. Without doubt, Gen. Banks will give the country to understand, at no distant day, where he Is, and what he Is doing. Let speculation fret Itself till that hour ar rives. News from St. Louis Is to the cflect that Gens. Hlndman and Marmaduke havo a force of 25,000 strong, with which they attempted to force General Blunt's position at Cane Hill. The enemy drove Inour picket s.three miles, but on our being reinforced, the enemy was repulsed. The opinion of Gen. Blunt Is that the demon stration made Is to cover their retreat, as they were felling timber all night, probably to ob struct the road to prevent pursuit. Blunt held tho enemy in check four days. He is already reinforced.
