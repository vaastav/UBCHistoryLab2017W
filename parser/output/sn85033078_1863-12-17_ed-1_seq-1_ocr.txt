The annual message of the President to Congress is published on (lie inside of to tliv’s paper. It is evidently the production of Abraham Lincoln, and nobody else, and, like all Ihe state papers which emanate from him, cannot fail to be received with heart felt approbation by the loyal portion of the American people. The position he arsmnes in regard lo the rebellious Slates will lomm ml i.seif lo ’he judgment of every meditative mind. He does not recognize o> correct the doctrine of lion. Charles Sunni-r and other statesmen, | that the m ceded States have reduced them- ! selves to the condition of territories and can j be restored to the Unitm only by new acts of j admission from Congress, ilc announces as j the proper course to pursue, to stand by the j I coon men in the revolted Stales and assist I them to re-organize their State governments | in their ow n w ay, subject to National laws. The Proclamation appended to .the Mes sage is a most important, and, it scorns to us, wise document. To the Scut hern masses i who have committed treason against the gov- I eminent, he oilers full pardon on their taking | the oa‘h of allegiance which he prescribes. It, will be seen ti-.it certain classes of leaders receive no Midi offers of pardon, and. the p c- | sumption is, that (hey must, sooner or later, ! ■swing by the neck for their infamous crimes, j Gon ni.K.ss AmiAn.ni Li.ncoi.n ! -

RAPIDS, WISCONSIN.—THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17. ISG3. Profitable Xuveetmenls. We would direct the attention of our read i ers to the advertisoiccnt, iu ar.o her column. 1 under the head of “U. S. 5-2‘G?.” Hon. <l. | Van Sceenwyk, preddent of the Batavian Ba k, La Crosse, is agent for this seed n of I the State, and of him Bonds may be ordered | or had at ail times. j The Philadelphia Xorth American gives j the following excellent advice to ail who wish | to invest money, and it is w-.il for ail who J are in funds to hood its counsel; Though money has been temporarily scarce, : capital continues abundant; and the recent | tumble in the stockmarkot lias brought cap | italists to a realizing sense of the unreliable . character of many of the S( eurities dealt in. i It i- greatly to the credit of the Government that its loans, of all the se urit - daily dealt j in on the market, have maintained.their in | tegrity of price better than almost anything | else, its Five Twenty year six per cent, loan, j the interest cu which is promptly paid in j gold, has b en subscribed to all through the : pressure in the money market, at an average jof more than two mil Tons per day. And what S is not the least gratifying fact iu connoc -1 turn With the daily largo subscriptions to | tiiis popuh r , >an, sc; re ;ly any of i: is return ed i.i tire market for sale. It is taken for in | vestment, and is held with unfaltering con- I fiJence in its relh-.blitv. And whv should It not be? It is g -eii that the Governmon* now, after two years of the most gigantic war that the world has evi r known, experiences no diffi culty in commanding the necessary means M prosecute it,or in paying regularly the interest in gold ns it fails and ie. if this can be done while the war is being waged, who cm antici pate any difiiculty in readily accomplishum it when the war shell be ended? What better investment thou, for capital, than the ‘'Five Twenty - ’ Government loan ? But if aav doubt, let him r< f i to the statistics furnished by the census table of various nations of the ! w rid. The facts which they present will prove the . most satisfactory mode of dis- i peJiing the numberless gloomy apprehensions j which are being continually conjured up by those who are disposed to exaggerate the ex- j tent ot the calamity occasioned bv our rebel lion. A reference to the suite of most of the prosperous nations of the old world clearly disproves such a position, and shows that the highest conditions oi national advancement have not been materially affected bj the ex tended wars in which those nations have bet u immemocially engaged, and that a heavy national indebtedness has not proved an unmitigated evil. lor instance, Great Britain, Franco and the Xe norlands will undoubtedly ba conceded ' to represent the highest prosperity that lias | been attained by any ol lac Aurotiean nations, j And yet no nations Jiave yet been called upon ! to endure fiercer or more prolonged w ars, do mestic and foi Re, sh.o-, tiny. The effect Ims been, utupiesrionably, to incur an enor mous national indebtedness; but neither their wars nor their indebtedness have had the effect to destroy their elasticity, n< r to check the progress of their general prosperity.— The result w ould have been different, proba bly. if those nations had been fallin. r into de cay, instead of being, as they really were, in a suit' of development; and in this respect their case resembles our own. with enormous auvan:ages rt our favor, rina-e nations, while undergoing toe trials of war, were opp- s ,-cd by the eviis of an immense exodus of their people, caused by the density iff their popu lation, the impossibility to provide occupation 1 for them, the low p: iee for labor, an i ih'j scarcity of tomtom. Compared with onr own | country, they possessed slight room for future ! ci velopiiieni; they wi re settled in everv pa !, a id no vast territory lay Invi ugly open io encimiMenterprise and Settlement, — Their great problem has over been what to do with their surplus population, which, in its turn, has sought new fields for adventure and seif support in countries like onr ow n. where an illimitable territory waits to b '■ developed, and where incalculable resources invite in dustry a.id energy, flic encouragmr.ent to bo derived from these Tads and comparisons of circumstances ’s very groat, and to the :• ind of any d.i.- )i ss 5 ma; e i cas uer is conclu sive that the course of this great country, is onward mid upward, and that its credit will live unimpaired to the end. i(cte ii.Ohh'tiserotijis. ilrsnd iTaaaory. r POE undersigned has now on hand, and! 1 will continue to keep, a large stock ofj

Prudence an I self-interest muA force the minds ot those the formation I of National Bunking Associations, as well as the minds ot all who have idle money on their hands, to the prompt conclusion that they should lose no. time in su svi.t_>in° to this most popular Loan. It will soon bo" b.vond their reach, and advance to a handsome pre mium, as was the result with the “Haven Thirty” Loin, when it was all sold and could j no longer be subscribed for,at par. It i* a Six per Cent. Loan, the Interest and, Principal payable in Coin , Ih>‘ i yielding e>, ,-I Xineper Cent.per n at the present rate of premium on coin. The Government requires all duties on im- | ports to be paid in Coin; these duties have for a long time past amounted to over a Quar ter ot a billion ot Dollars daily', a sum near ly three limes greater than that required in the payment of the interest on all the 5-20’s! and other permanent Loans. . So tb.,t it is ! hoped that the surplus Coin in the Treasury, at no distant day, will enable the United States to resume specie payments upon ail liabilities. The Loan is called 5-20 from the fact that whilst the Bonds may run fer 20 years, "vet Hi Govern t has a pay' them off in Gold at par, at any time after 5 years, Tm: J.riEiiF.sT is paid half-yearly, viz: on the first days of November and May.
