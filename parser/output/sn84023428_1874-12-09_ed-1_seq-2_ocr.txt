The following are hints of what It contain.', were published on Monday. And associated press despatch says The president's message was not quite com pleted. owing to a delay in receiving the report of the. Districts of Columbia com misaioiiers, a reference to which will be added to the message, Monday morning Although the rrestnent has shown the Mcfsagc to no pen-on other than those of the cabinet and the copyists, there is the best reasoll for believing it will contain substantially the following points, foundud on an expression of the President to inti. mate friends since th messago was Mib mitted to and cordially indorsed by the cabinet ou Friday last : The President says that, although be did not commence tb? preruratinn of his message until week ago Friday, some of the newspapers pre viously prognosticated its contents, al though he had consulted nobody ns to what it would contain. There is no doubt the nicssngd will state that our relations with all foreign powers are friendly and without distuibiiree, though there is an unsettled question with Vcneztiula, which has not paid the awards of the joint com mission under the convention of 18GG. Congress, it will be recollected, strongly expressed its sense on this subject in Feb ruary, 1873. The President, in his mes sage of last December, said there was reason to believe the hesitancy of that republic in recognizing the claims sprung in part, at least, from r.-ul difficulty in discharaiii" them in connection with its obligations to otlior governments, and therefore the expediency of further for beuratiec on tho part of our government was believed to bo worthy of the consid eration of Congress. In additiuti to Vcn zuelii we have unsettled questions with Spain, growing out of the affair of the of tho Virginiui and other grievous trans actions on the part of the Spanish author ities in connection with events in Cuba. The magnitude of the offenses has not been reduced since the President's previ ous message, a year ago. A this unset tled condition of affairs in Cuba cannot long continue, it may becomo necessary for other nations, with our own, to inter fere to terminate the insurection which has so long prevailed, the Spanish govern ment having unsuccessfully attempted to suppress it. In tho moan time the com ineice of nil countries, and especially that of tho United States, suffers, the flags of the United Slates and Englaud having l een insulted. Tho president says in this conversation, although he does not state the fact in his message, that the United States purehaso about 80 per cent, of the Cuban exports, and therefore tho duties paid by American citizens contribute to this extent in helping Spain to conti.iuo the war against tho Insurgents, The President had hoped thai by the meeting of Congress, Monday, the pietent negoti ations with Spain would havo ended, but in this ho has been disappointed. He therefore says in his inessago littlo or nothing ubout the iudemnity, pending the negotiations, but at u future time will present the subject to the special consid etation of Cougress. The positional' tho President on the financial question is positive. He desires aud will recommend the resumption of specie payments at tho earliest practical day, but does not believe this pan be reached as soon ns the first of January, 187G. He does not name any day, leav ing Congress to devise means to seeure this desired end, it being the duty of Con gross to do so. Tho legul-tonder clause of the currency act should be repealed, to lake effect as to contracts madj after tho day to be 6xed by law for its repeal. Power should be given to secretary of the treasury to obtain gold from and after the date fixed by the resumption of specie payments by the issuanco of bonds. In addition to this, tho rewuuesof the gov ernment should bo in excess of the ex penditures to support resumption ; greater economy should be practiced in alljdepart nienlB of the government, aud If necessary the customs and internal revenue laws bi changed, in order !o secure a larger amount of revenue. With the return of specio payments, banking should bo free. Vill-holdorj should continue to bo protect ed as at present under tho banking law, and thero shoulJ bo no limitation to the volume of the curroncy, as the communi ty itseif should determine what amount is icquired for business transactions, instead of leaving tho executive, secretary of the treasury and Congress to fix the limit. It would bo the duty of Congress, however, to make regulations regarding free banks of issue, and to state the conditions on which they can be organized and transact business, tho legislation to be iu accord ancc with the new order of things, or, iu other words, tho resumption of specie payments. There should be no monopoly by fixing the amount of issue. Tho Pres ident will recommend that Congress do not interfere with tho present currency act, passed dnring the lust session, unless to nmend it so as to conform with a plan .of the resumption of specie payment. Tte I'rcaidcot will nuke no reoommen - datioo on the subject of internal improve nicula by 'he general government, but will merely refer to the fact that Congress has a It end v appointed committee on transportation routes to the seaboard, which has already mado its report, and will give further information from wore recent investigations, Considerable space is devoted t affairs in Arkansas, the reasons given why he declined to interfere in the recent difficul ties in (bat state, and ho adverts to the facts narrated in his special Bieaaugo to Cungress, in February, 1873, relative to Louisiana, in which he said he had no specific recommendation to mako on the subject, but, if there were any practical way of removing those difficulties by leg' Dilation, then be earnestly requested that the question might be taken at that ses- of Congress. Ho was extreme! anxious to avoid any pretense of undue interfer ence iu state affairs, and, if Congress dif fered with him as to what ought to be done, be requested its immediate decision to that effect, otherwise he should feel obliged, as far as he could, by the exer cise of legitimate authority, to put an end to tho unhappy controversy which disturbed tho peace and prostrated the business of Louisiana, by the recognition uud support of that government which was recognized and upheld by tho courts of the state. It seemed advisable that he should state which courso he should feel bound to pursue in reference to the matter, in the event of no aetico beios taken by Congress at that time, but sub ject to any satisfactory arrangements that might be made by tho parties to tho con troversy, and which of all things was the most desirable. It would be his duty, so far as it might be necessary for him to act, to adhere to tho government heretofore recognized by him. The pres. ident again submits this question to Con gress, and will continue to act as ho has horetofore ncted relativo to the affairs of Louisiana, unless otherwise controlled by Congress. Tho President reiterates his confidence in tho Jniian peace policy. If adhered to he says it will produco additional ben eficial results, nnd ultimately free the frontier of Indian depredations. He al ludes to the civil service reform, as close, ly adhered to as the opposition manifested against it permitted. Its results havo been made beneficiul, having elevated the capacity and tone of appohtmentr iu the several departments of the government, but it would bo impossible to continue the reform without, the direct support of Con gnjss, sanctioned by the people. He al ludes te the reports of the heads of the several departments which accompany the message, and calls attention to their re spective rcccommcndations. Ho again rec ommends tho pussago of a law establish ing a court for tho adjudication of claims of aliens against the government, a bill for which purpose was introduced by Judgo Lawrence at tho previous session of Congress. Tho President docs not al lude to Utah affairs, tho subject being left open for future consideration. He calls attention to tho fact that Cliinose emigrants continue to be brought to the country under the condition of slaves, ac cording to contract, snd also women, whose character is such as to demoralize the communities in which they are loca ted, aro brought over. Ha itivites legis tioo on this subject, saying it will bo his pleasuro as well as duty to enforce any law ou the subject Tho annual report of Secretary Rob- eson sljows the navy to be in a remarka bly efficient condition, both as regards the number of vessels, their armament, and sea-going qualities. Their prerent num ber is 103, with 1254 guns, tho arma ment having been slightly increased by an increase in tho number of guns on the new ships. Of the iron-olads, or armed ves sels, 16 lira of a class and in condition for actual and efficient service ; four others of the class of powerful doublc-turreted monitors are actually on hand undergoing repairs, and a fifth is well worth the same attention, but the rcmaiudcr may be count ed as really useless for any active and eflicent purposo One-balf of the steam navy adapted to cruising is in commission and in actual service This number of vessels cannot be prudently diminished, but if it is to be maintained there must be a gradual and constant addition to the ta vy to supply tho places of those which are each year fouud to bo worn out and unfit for further service, and for this purpose a fixed amount of tonnage should bo built every year. This amount may be small, but it should be constant and unfailing To this end tho depmtmect has accumu lated a large amount of live-oak timber in tho various navy-yards, where it will year ly improve in condition and be available as the very best material for the frames of any ships it muy at any time bo neces sary or desirable to build. The Virgioius affair is referred to, as is the presence of yellow fuverat Peosacola. An account is given of tho naval drill in the gulf of Mexico, and uredit awarded to tho naval academy and torpedo school. The detail of certain sailing ships for the state marine schools is noted, and the ef- I forts to secure emigration of Icelanders to I ' Alaska, The aecretary ia the interest of our navy and of eoomif rec earnestly rec j oaitnendf thai, if the IcelaaJio commit Ice shall find at any point on oar Pacific coast a satisfactory location, whatever assistance the government is competent to extend toward tabluhing an Icelandio colocy thero be promptly offered. The secretary calls atteotioo to the im portance of the bydiograghio office, and recommends that it receive from Congress such mpport as may place it on a footing with the most important of such institu tions abroad. He thinks special attention should be givon to the surveys of the North I'aoifio ocean. He alludes to the report concerning navy yards to be made by the Senate naval committee, and re news the recommendations made in his previous aonual reports in reference to oa vy yards and urges the propriety of in creasing aud developing their resources. He calls attention to the use of torpedoes as a means of naval warfare. The disci pline of the marine corps is reported cred itable, but the force should be enlarged. The actual expenditures of tbo ovy for the last fiscal year were $26.254,156 ; the appropriations available for the current fis cal year, $'9,273,731. of which $11,854, 447 had been drawn to Deeen-ber 1. of which about (9,060,000 had been actual ly expended, It was a conscientious aud consider ate acton thepatt of Col. Rcdfield Proc tor of Rutland, president pro tempore of the senate, to decliue the double pay us ually allowed that officer, and the act is all tbo more praiseworthy because he claims there was do merit in it, bis con struction of the law being that only tho president of the Senate, aud not the presi dent pro tern., ihall receivo six dollars a day.

Rumors have been afloat for about a day to the effect that a young man in the employ of a far mer south-west of this village hud just remarked that ho knew whero the missing bundle of Miss Rail's elothing was.

CorrcHpondence. To lout Ou awai road, for the people, living south of the riier, for the one taken from them by the R. R., are sure to be required ; and at a cost of, probably, not less than four thou sand dollars. Eleven hundred ate due thj late select-men, and as it is now in lata, there will be added in costs, doubtless, five hundred dollars more. The Bonds, now to be issued, being forty-eight thousand, and the interest on them, during their life, will, with the charge of collecting, be a fraction over sixty thousand dollars more. On the town there has been a debt, of long standing, of three thousand dollars. Tho whole (exclusive of the bridge and road referred to above) amounts to one hundred aud twelve thousand six hundred dollars The Grand List is now. I think, forty-two hundred dollars.--Great as this burden is, it is, in my opinion, our duty to enter into such arrangements with the corporation as to lift it by a few installment!. It is not with us as it is with growing towns. Al ready they have men of wealth, and more, from time to time, are to be expected. Such towns, therefore, will be in a better condition to meet such liabilities in the fu ture than in the present. The contrary is the case with us. We have no men of wealth, and not but a few in, what way be called, easy circuin tauces. I look for no incomers with riches, and any, who may come, will be nnlv such ss buy out those now here and wishing to remove. Many of our farming class are not yet out of the debt they contracted, on buying their farms. 'Their current expetccs arc such as to leave but a small sum tovard liquidating their debt. Super-add to these expenses those which this east burden will impose, and, if no bankruptcies follow, tow men will be more grateful than 1. To me, therefore, the future holds out no better prospects than tho present. And, for one, I prefer to sacrifice ourselves, who have involved our town in this great calamity, rather than fasten it upon posterity, who, so far as the future may be divined by the present, will have burdum enough of their own. Doe any one reply "that the town cannot meet such installments, as I sug-ger-t." My answer is ready. We can do it as well as any in the coming twenty years. At any rule, if we cannot, none during the life of the bonds can. Then, in honor, not to say in morals, it is im peratively onus to reliovo tbe coming town, from such a crushing load. There it no timo to be lost. Li-t a request be mode, by our citizens. ChadwtcR and Knight to Horace Fairbanks not to al io f the bonds to pass out of his hand, uu- til we see if wo can compromise, by three or four installments. And (if he will agree to it) let a town meeting be convoued at tho earliest day, to test the taxpayers on the matter. Better to settle the matter now than to have so appalling an incum brance lie upon our properly. Nay let this matter go down and what prudent man who detests debt will consent to re main in the town? I am willing to be taxed for my proportion cf the sore bur-i den now. J A VI K9 DoUGUEHTY, Johnson, Deo. 5, 1874. Johnson, Dec. 8th, 1874. Mr. Editor: In your editorial of Dec. 2d, I notice a tiradd on your representative, who if as vilo a man as you represent him to be, should not be allowed to enjoy the confi dence and respect of such a largo propor tion of all who know him, and go unscathed, except by editors whom he does not pat- rouize. I am not a member of tho party that elected him, but am a member of his family, eoncqucntly have taken iutercst in this matter of "mileage grab" enough to ascertain tho facts in tho case, which are as follows: The said representative was a member of tbe mileage committee, he labored for the short route for Lamoille County, together with the adoption of the same plan throughout tbe State and in the final adjustment of this county was the only one who voted for the short route. After this he consulted other represent lives similarly situated in this county. who could not got to Monlpelicr by public con. veyance in any one day, except by rait and they dooided as it was the custom of tbe Stste, and the only route they trav eled by publio conveyance, to accept it. Your representative is not a policy man to receive or rejoct this fee as a praotical politician might ; but did receive pay for 110 miles, Johnson representative for 117 and Eden representative prorata Now would it not be a hard matter to make this community believe that these men did all commit an unpardonable wrong by ac cepting this fc. Would it not be well for the publio to know that you are actu ated by a personal hatred, and tha. bis opinion of you is such that he deems your article of too little consoquenee to answer, This explanation I trust you will deem proper for me to make, and thanking you for past personal favors, I remain Yours truly, R.

Mr. Smith niaJe some re ply, to the effect that they brought them Iu with them, supposing that he referred to their coat, which they had thrown off in the Gold, while at work. But Pcrlc ns said lie didn't mean that, but referred to the ololbos of Miss Ball. Smith then drew out a story which led him to suspect thst he was on a clue and so bo thought he would quietly follow it np. Taking into bis confidence Geo. Bron son. tbey went to the young man's homo in Fairfax and there the boy's mother. Mrs. Riggs. told them the same story that he had. with some other particulars. The story in brief is that a man named John Mason, soma fifty years old, aud a spinner by occupation, had spent consid erable time at Mr. Riggs' when uot at work in the factories at Fairfax, Euos burgh Falls, Sholdon or elsewhere. He had been thero the week beforo tbe mur der and told them that when ho came again ho might bring a friend with htm. On Saturday night July 25th the next day after tho murder, two men came to their house after they had retired and tried to get in, one calling on both Mr. and Mrs. Riggs to open the door, but they refused them admittance, Mrs. R. is positivo that the man calling was John M ason. Ho was not seen aftor for some six week, when ho returned there, and in conversation went on to describe bow Miss Hall was murJored. He said it was dono by one man, though another was preseut; that he sprang in behind her, seized her and when she screamed ho struck heron tho head with a stone; that ho then drew her over the fence, which ho had previously thrown down, and drag ged her to the thicket; that she (here caught hold of a staddle aud he 6truck her hand with a club breaking thee of the fingers : that other blows wore then dealt, and they drew her further on into tho woods ; that they pushed her watch aud belt one side into the leaves (and the woman gave such description of tho watch as he gave her, and it is said to he toler ably like); that after they hud lain her behind the stump she rolled be: lieud for some time und then breathed her last ; they then laid her out ami went down to tho stream nod washed themselves, taking along her bundle; that they examined her wallet before leaving her, but found nothing in it but her teacher, a certificate and some poetry clipped from a paper; they first buried her bundle, which he said contained her drawers, night dress, slippers etc , in the sawdust at the mill but afterward took out a stotio from the underpiuing and thrust it in thero. Tho young man Perkins says that one of tbo men then went off south towards FniiTux and the other camo to St. Albans and took the train south. Mrs. Riggs at the time called the utteotion of Deputy Sheriff Ilalbert to tho mutter, and he went to her house and investigated it. But he had no confilence in, it, and the woman herself says that folks don't al ways believe what she tells. But thero is another and even more sus piuiojs circuit stance iclated by her, relat ing to the Minard murder, which occurred only a few days before tho murder of Miss Ball. The next day after that murder, and before it was known in St. Albans, she says that Mason c.ime to lior house and told her all about it. She had not then heard of it, but afterward h:urd the faots as they betsamo known to the public, and they uorrosponded with the story that ho had told her. At that time she asked him to fix tho clock, which was out of re pair. He said he coulJu't for he hadn't any tools not even a knifo. She says she knows that he had previously hndakuite, for she had used it and broken the point off one of the blades. She was then asked to give a description of the knife, which she did, aud it corresponded precisely with the appearance of the knife that was taken from the body of Minard. She was aikcd if sbe should know tbe knifo on sight, and she thought she would. A large numbor knives were then produced and she se lected one that she was very positive was Mason's. It was the same knife that was taken from the body of Minard. Muson disappeared shortly after relat ing the story to her and his whereabouts are not know. While the authorities are by no means sanguino this will lead to a discovery of the murderer of either victim, yet the story is sufficiently suspicious so that they will learn what moro about it they can. Masou had known Miss Ball, ha-i seen ber at her sister's in Sheldon, and it is said he acquired a viol.mt dislike for her. Mrs Riggs says when he told her tho strange story he said the girl was mar dered frem ill-wjll and uot to cover up an other crime A boy, aliding down a step hill at WeH "Randolph, the other day, when a train of cars suddenly cam upon tha crossing beforo him, after it wag too late fo atop his sled, but he fortunately passed under one of tho ears and escaped injury!
