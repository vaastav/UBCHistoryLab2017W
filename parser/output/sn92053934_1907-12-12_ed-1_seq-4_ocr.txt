Financing Hie Waterway. St. Louis Republic: The net result of last week's work in Washington in behalf of river and harbor improve ments is that the largest waterway association in the country, national in scope, has urged upon the congress of the United States the adoption of a continuous and consecutive plan of waterway improvement. The approval by the Rivers and Harbors congress of a large bond is sue for the purpose of carrying fn--ward the work need not be taken to me;m that the issue of those bonds is asked for. if the work can Ik con tinuously carried forward, on a well formed plan, with money supplied from the general revenues.

Cortelyou threw $20,000, 000 clear to Wall street, and nothing was said about it. the proceeds of bond sales be made available only if they should become necessary. The strong recommendations of the president's message, coupled with tb general admission that our inland waterways have become absolutely necessary to the country's commer cial and industrial progress, should be conclusively persuasive with con gress, at the present session, to make some such safe and certain provision for betterment of navigation in them. Neglect to do so will cost the repub lican party heavily in the elections, of lftOS. "I suppose it is my Scotch bluntness, girlie," 1 answered.

We climbed the other side of the canyon and started along the trail, nar row as it skirted the sand hills and hiird to follow. At its end Madeline was pink cheeked, and her hair was blowing about lief sweet face in dusky little crinkles. "I can't explore the rocks and the caves and all tbe wonders of tbe deep till I get my breath," she declared, dropping on the sand. "There's plenty of time," I answer ed, comfortably sitting down by her, "We have the whole long day before us." "A whole long day?" she repeated musingly.

My house and the house -which sheltered Madeline and the other houses on the bluff were probably not in danger. But my dredg er! When n'mau stands twelve feet above ocean level and cannot viewlhe open sea because of the height of the! breakers, he clearly understands the fate. off a gold dredger or any other object in its very jiath. In the course of hours it was an over. Looking at tlie deceptive cairn one never would have imagined the destruction the sea had wrought. I stooll on the beach and viewed the wreck of my fortune. Fifty thousand feet of lumber which had once been the boat lay scal'.ered. along the shore farther than the eye could reach. Ten thousand dollars', worth of machinery which had lteen' the motive power of the boat lay here and yon in millions of pieces, burying , themselves in the sand, while the work' of brain and toll of hands had been as nothing to the sea in her madness. I As I stood there a voice came sweet ly to my ears, and a hand was laid timidly on my arm. 1 "It seems such a pity, Jamie, such a dreadful thing to have happened!, but I do believe everything that hap pens is for the liest if we can only look at it right. I'm so sorry, but you aren't entirely discouraged, are you, Jamie?" - ' , My pulse leaped at the sound of her voice. If I could have had her. what would I have cared for any other loss in the whole world? ' "There are many worse things In life, girlie," I answered, smiling at her. "I shall do the work again; that's all. It wouldn't do to let my self grow; discouraged." Then a most surprising thing hap Iened. My little Madeline, with a wonderful look in Ver dark eyes, stood on tiptoe and raised her face to inc. "Jamie, let me help you start again. I was such a little fool tbe other day. You didn't tell nie you loved me. Yon just talked about :$ tending money on ,me. and you seemed so sure of me that I thought I knew you meant it right, loo, but I I the demand does create the supply, Jamie. The law is unfailing." It was such a baiting little voice and such a delicious liirle pink face raised to mine. I kissed the trembling lips with one long, thankful touch. and whe:i I let the little girl go from my embrace she laughed, though a lit tle shakily. "Would you rather have lost tbe boat. Jamie, and, found your sweet heart?" And I answered, "Another dredger can be made, but In all the world there is only one Madeline." fV. fth5v: II i l II Personal Beauty
