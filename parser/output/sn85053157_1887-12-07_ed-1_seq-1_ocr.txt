( nexpc:t.ed Numbers of Cattle and Sheep Taken to Market by the Northern Pa cific. The widely circulated reports of the loss ,,f cattle in Montana last winter were such ,s to convey the idea that there would be a heavy falling off in the live stock traffic this fall. The conclusion, however, is not warranted by the facts as the figures will prove. The Northern Pacific has hauled cast from Montana and Western Dakota this season 72,450 head of beef cattle against 80,950 in 1886, a decrease of only ,5i0x head. Last year 2,280 head of cattle were shipped east from Washington Ter ritory, but on account of the coast demand i.ing greater this year none were shipped, 5( that the shortage from Muntana and W\esteru Dakota is only 6,220 head. The Itub her of sheep brought to market this year by the Northern Pacific was 99,638 ieadl, against 110,525 head last year, a de rease of 10,895. These figures show a de rease in the stock movements of only 10 per cent., whereas conservative judges had estimated at least 50 per cent, as whole fioeks of sheep were literally wiped out .ast winter. In spite of the losses of last winter and the decline in the market, stockmen are now planning to replenish :heir ranges, and next year will see large iiumbers of tattle driven into Montana arid Western Dakota. The officers of the Northern Pacific road are very much pleased wilthi the showing in the stock rmovement, as the company is interested as ,leeply as any other one concern in the sue ess of the live stock industry in the orth west.- Pioneer Press. Choteau County's Wealth. From an interesting abstract of Cho teau county's assessment for the current year, furnished by County Clerk Rogers, we learn that the assessment of 1887 shows an increase over that of 1886 by sonic `786,873 as follows: Total valuation, 1887. ............4,371,555 do do 1886........... 3,584,682 Increase, ........... 786,873 The10 above satisfactory showing resulted mnainly from an increase in values of lands, town lots, and improvements on public lands, and to a less extent by an increase in moneys and credits, merchandise, and other assessable property. The only items showing a decrease are those in cat tle and swine-the formea representing a loss of $542,511, and the latter a decrease of $1,930. It will be seen from the above that Choteau county's record will com pare favorably with that of any other in the territory, and with the developments now going on in this section, it promises to continue close to the head of the pro cession. Railway Notes. [Indepeudhnt, 27th.] The Montana Central train went out yesterday with a hundred passengers. The Montana Central yards extend tc the crossing of the main line of the North emrn Pacitic, two and a half miles from the depot. Plans have been prepared and work will begin to-morrow on the erection of a round house for the Montana Central. It will contain seventeen stalls, be built of brick and iron under the latest style of architecture and located about 200 yards westerly from the main depot building. The passenger fares from Helena to points on the Montana Central are as fol lows: Single fares to Marysville Junc tion 85 cents, Mitchells, $1.45; Wolf Creek, $1.90; Craig, 82.30; Hardys, $3.05; Cascade, l3.45; Ulm, 84.20; Great Falls, $4.90; Sand (')ule, 85.;5. Round trip fares from Hel (ena to Marysville Junction, $1.55; Mitch ells, 352.5; Wolf Creek, $3.45; Craig, $1.15; Ilardys, $5.50; Cascade, 86.25; Ulm, $7.60; (;reat Falls, $8.85; Sand Coulee, $10.20. The freight depot of the Montana Cen 1ral is rapidly approaching completion, i.nd work has begun on the passenger depot. Mr. T. C. Power, who came out from St. I'aul over the Northern Pacific limited L'epress, is very enthusiastic over these :rains. He says they can hardly be ex ,'eded by any of the celebrated trains on the old roads of the east. He says that there is a little friction just now that 'auses some delay, owing to the trains be- I ing started a few months before it was intended to do so. This was caused by the Union Pacific putting on fast trains tO Portland and attempting to capture the )regon and Washington mail from the Northern Pacific. The latter had to put :Io its fast train immediately. Mr. Power says the roadbed is in most excellent con dition and everything will be running smoothly in a very short time. The editor of the Railway Age has been C'ontinuing the investigation into the rec (hrds of rapid railroad building and in pur suance of the work addressed a letter to fMr. C. P. Huntington, of the Central and Southern Pacifics, in regard to the matter. 'he latter replied that the Central Pacific construction forces "roused themselves r;td laid ten miles and a few hundred feet in one working day, without resorting to artificial light, as appears to have been done in the case of the Manitoba road." But "it was necessary to haul a portion of the ties and rails out in advance." To this the Railway Age says: "It will be seen that Mr. Huntington confirms the statement already made in these columns to the effect that in accomplishing this remarkable achievement the rails were laid simultaneously at several points; and hence it remains that the Manitoba per formance ranks as the most rapid work of continuous tracklaying ever accomplish ed."_ Neihart : ews. J. H. Seifred, of Neihart, arrived in the city yesterday, and brings favorable news regarding that promising camp. During the past few weeks a number of men have been engaged in doing representation work I on the mines on Snow creek, and the re sult of the developments so far have been such to renew their confidence in the value of their respective properties. Mr. Seifred is himself interested in the Jenny Whipple, and 'a recent assay of ore from this prop erty gave a showing of S53 in silver and S2 in gold to the ton. Wm. Seifred and Gus Okerman are interested in the Snow drift, and there is every indication that they have a veritable bonanza. Messrs. Briggs, Macqueen, Dunc. McDonald, Hamilton and others have also been at work on their claims, and are all well sat isfied with their present prospects. The ore in this district is free milling, and it only needs transportation facilities to make Neihart the most prosperous camp in the west. Mr. Seifred states that the miners of Neihart find Benton the most satisfactory trading point in this section; it is as con venient to reach as any other, and goods can be purchased much lower in the Ben ton market than elsewhere. A 

SQUARE DEAL. Eastern Mail to Come via the St. P., M. & M. R. R., Commencing December 15th. From the following telegram. received this morning by Messrs. W. G. and C. E. Conrad, it will be seen that the long wish ed for change in the transportation of our eastern mails will soon go into effect. Un der this arrangement, the mails will reach here 60 hours out from St. Paul, a saving of 36 hours over the present route: ST. 

PAUL, December 2. Conrad Bros., Benton, Mont.: We have an order establishing mail service on our line to Benton and Great Falls, to begin the 15th inst. A. MANVEL. The Future of the Manitoba. It is stated by persons who are thor oughly well informed that within two years the systems now controlled by Messrs. Hill and Broadwater will be known by names only in history. There is no longer any doubt that the directors of the Chicago, Burlington & Northern and Chicago, Burlington & Quincy have their index finger pointed to Montana and ultimately to Seattle and ikuget Sound. It is not more than three years ago that Wall street was much agitated by rumors originating in well known financial circles that overtures had been made to Presi dent Hill and the board of directors of the Manitoba railroad towards a joint interest in the Manitoba system pointing to the future control of the latter company by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. It is within the recollection of many of our fi nancial men of Montana that this rumor came from such well founded sources that the Manitoba stock jumped fifteen points in two days and gradually continued to climb toward the maximum limit it had touched during the previous two years. In well informed eastern circles it is gen erally believed that St. Paul and Minne apolis are but temporary northern termi nals and that Helena, Butte and Anacon da are the objective points at which the C., B. & N. is aiming by control of the Manitoba-Montana Central system. We believe this statement to have some foun dation in fact. The directors of both roads quite recently left Boston and visit ed northern Dakota and Montana, begin ning at St. Paul and inspecting every mile of the Manitoba road in daylight to Fort Benton, Great Falls and Helena. On reaching Helena they came to Butte and Anaconda and gathered as many statistics as to freight earnings in this district as was possible, leaving thoroughly satisfied that a fair share of the traffic of Butte and Anaconda, with the latter's greatly increased facilities in the immediate fu ture for the reduction of ores and conse quent increase in the present enormous output of copper matte, would alone fur nish a profit sufficient to pay the operat ing expenses of their transportation de partment between those points and Dev il's Dake.-Butte Miner. Found Guilty. 

CLEVELAND, O., December 2.--John Coughlin, a partner of Blinky Morgan, indicted for the murder of Deltie D. Cul ligan, was foMnd guilty o, naLmu r in the first degree at Ravenna this afternoon. A motion for a new trial was fll&L WANTS $4,000,000. The Suit Brought by Jesse Farley Against J. J. Hill et al. Eight or nine years ago the St. Paul & Pacific railroad bonds were a drug in the financial market. The line had been built by Dutch capital, and the bond, were nearly all owned in Holland. The country had not recovered from financial depression, and railroad stocks of all kinds were very low. The St. Paul & Pacific bonds were quoted at five cents on the dollar, and this opportunity for specula tion was not lost on Jesse P. Farley, a res ident of Dubuque, Iowa. He approached J. J. Hill, now president and principal owner of the Manitoba railroad company, and advised him that for the small sum of $750,000 the bonds of the road could be purchased, a controlling interest secured, and when the money movement should again become easier a fortune could be made. Mr. Hill hadn't that amount of money to his credit at that time, but he went to Commodore Kittson, a warm friend, and pointed out the advantages to be derived from the purchase. Commo dore Kittson hadn't the money, but he had warm friends in Canada who possessed a controlling interest in the Bank of Mon treal, and there the money was procured and the purchase made. Two others be side Mr. Kittson, Mr. Hill and Mr. Farley were interested in the deal, and each was to have one-fifth interest. Mr. Farley's modesty, or perhrps some other motive, prevented his name appearing as one of the purchasers, and when the deal was finally consumated he was-as he claims in his complaint-ignorcd in the transac tion. He made every effort to have his claim recognized, but without avail. The value of the stock appreciated rapidly, and when Commodore Kittson sold out his interest he realized a sum that seven fig ures are required to enumerate. Every one knows what the Manitoba road is to day, and what its stock is quoted at, and knows further that the St. Paul & Pacific franchise is the keystone of the entire fab ric. The sum Mr. Farley demands is nearly S4,000,000, and the case, after being tried in the United States courts of the state, went to the supreme court of the nation, and was returned with the advice that the complainant had grounds for ac tion, and ordered the taking of testimony. Thus far nearly six hundred pages of tes timony has been taken and the end is not yet. Mr. Farley is fortunately a man of means, and he never expects to see the end of the case because of his advanced years. He will leave the lawsuit as a leg acy to his son. The case bids fair to be another case of "Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce," without the romance that Dickens wove about that historic litigation.-Pioneer Press. Territorial News. It has been decided to form a post of the G. A. R. at Anaconda. The :Butte street cable car line is now almost completed. and will be operated by a steam motor. The citizens of Butte are considerably elated over the new deal in freight rates, which places them on an equal footing with those of Helena. It was a simple matter of justice to the great mining camp, and the' new arrangement will doubtless prove profitable to all concerned. It looks as though Agent Williamson was likely to get into some difficulty over the leasing of grazing privileges on the Crow reservation. He was instructed to invite bids for the same, but let the con tract without receiving bids. Somebody has been making about $20,000 a year on the transaction, and it is suspected that Mr. W. has a finger in the pie. Old Accounts Collected. S. Toby, Jr., representing the United States Mercantile Protective Association, of New York city, with branch office at Helena has introduced amongst our mer chants the system of the association he represents, the object being to facilitate the collection of debts, to prompt debtors to pay, and to inform members regarding people who do not pay, and thus prevent merchants from being defrauded by a class of people who never intend to pay their honest bills. We hope to see the merchants make the system a source of protection. Nobody Waits Them. News having been sent out from Wash ington, that an attempt was to be made to remove a portion of the no;thern Indians to the Crow reservation, the citizens of Billings have met in mass meeting, and voiced their indignation,at the contempla ted outrage. The authorities seem to think that the proposed location is pre ferable to the one now existing close to the international boundary line, as trouble is constantly being fomented by the continual raids made bnk and forth between the British Indians and our own. Wherever the authorities may ultimately 4hoide to remove th-. Indians now roam tog over the northern reservation, it may be taket for granted. that there will be strong opposition 6orithe part of their neighbors. They would be looked upon as an intolerable nuisance anywhere. It is a foregone conclusion that their reser vation will be opened to settlement the coming spring, and it is to be hoped that neither the citizens of Billings or any other Montana town will have cause to complain as to th~ solution of this prob lem. Preparations for the Permanent Line.- Fifteen Tlrousand Ties! The Manitoba is engaged in unloading at the Benton side tracks fifteen thousand railroad ties. While the employees here do not have anything to say about what these ties are intended for, it is well known that they are to be used in build ing the permanent line from the M arias through the Cracon-du-Nez hill and up the Missouri to Fort Benton. The 3Iani toba proposes to get everything ready this winter, and in the spring the heavy gra "ding will be commenced from both ends. Fifteen thousand ties will lay about seven miles of track. t,.litical D)iviqiol of the House. The clerk of the house has issued an official list of members elect, by which it appears that the strength of parties will be: Democrats, 168; Republicans, 153; Independents, 4. The four men classified as independents are: A. R. Anderson, Iowa; John Nichols, North Carolina; Sam uel I. Hopkins, Virginia, and Henry Smith, Wisconsin. In twenty states the Repub licans are in the majorty, and in the event cf the next presidential election being thrown into the house, would cast the vote o! that number of states fbr their candi date for president. One state, New Hamp shire, is equally divided. The vote of the four members classified as independents, cist with either party, would make no dif ference in the status of the two great par ties in this particular.

The Helena Board of Trade met yester day and passed the following resolutions: Whereas, An act of congress, approved March 7, 1887, entitled "An act to restrict the ownership of real estate in the terri tories to American citizens," has had the effect of entirely shutting out foreign capital from investing in the mines and mining property in Montana; and where as, by the decision of the attorney general of the United States the restriction of ownership in real estate designed by said law is held to be applicable to mineral lands as well as to agricultural realty; and, whereas, the aforesaid law of con gress is detrimental to the development of the mining lands and mineral resources of Montana; therefore, be It Resolved, That the Helena Board of Trade" respectfully petition the congress of the United States to repeal that .por tion of the act aforesaid that has refer ence to foreign ownership in mines and mineral lands in the territories. Resolved, That copies of this resolution be forwarded by the secretary to the Hon. J. K. Toole, delegate in congress from Montana, and to the president of the Unit ed States senate.-Independent. A Wonderful Legacy. E. K. Norris, who died on the street a few nights ago, and who had for three years been in charge of the upper floor of the Comique' left a legacy which bids fair to stir Butte from center to circumfer ence. It is neither more nor less than a minute record of his daily life, detailing the name of every man who visited the Comique, the company he was in, the numb r of bottles he bought, how long he stayed, and how full he was when he went home. It is truly a wonderful document and full of weird interest to those who do not know where the Comique is. Norris was a Jim Dandy, and left probably the most important posthumous document of any man of modern times. It is believed that he was slightly aberrated, but his eyes were clearer than his head, and he had an unhappy faculty of jotting down everything that he saw. I-d he lived longer he could have disposed of his diary to the parties chiefly interested in its sup pression for about two-thirds of their earthly posessions.-Inter Mountoin. "As Others See Us." A gentleman recently over the Manitoba says itis amuing to note the restlessness of the people of Great Falls and Benton along the line traveling on the ca&. They can scarcely realize that the road is re iy completed and. that they are going i.y rail wherebta -few months ago they thumped along on the old stage coach,.- usband .AA .- L. A Shooting Scrape. 

HELENA, December 2.-A serious shoot- ; ing scrape occurred on Main street, near Worth's saloon, at one o'clock this morn ing. John McTierney, familiarly known under the sobriquet of "Flick," exchanged shots with one Jerry Manning, and as subsequently developed, the latter re ceived three wonnds. The matter origi nated in a trivial quarrel between the two men, in which threats were freely uttered, and on meeting soon after midnight on Main street, Manning opened fire on his opponent. Flick lost no time in giving battle, and six shots were quickly ex changed, which resulted in Manning fail ing severely wounded. Officers arrived at the scene and arrested both parties, and on examination Manning was found to have received three wounds, one of which is likely to prove fatal. Flick was un injured. The latter is generally regarded as a quiet and inoffensive individual; but Manning on the contrary was of an ugly and quarrelsome disposition, and was al ways making a gun play of some kind. Both men are now confined in the county jail, and the friends of the imprisoned men are greatly excited over the affair. Btutte'sf Water Supply. BUTTE, December 2.-The committee appointed two weeks ago to investigate the new water supply of the Silver Bow Water company as to whether or not it was contaminated by the sewerage from the grave yard, made their report to-night to the city cauncil. The committee con sists of Major Kenyon, Dr. Haugh and Al dermen Butler and Owsley and were as sisted in their work by leading mining men. They sunk wells and in other ways ascertained to their satisfaction that the water underlying the whole section is con taminated and that there are the best of reasons to suspect that the grave yard contaminates the water. It was also dis covered that a slaughter house with a filthy corral is situated up the gulch from the water works, and that the stream of water which passes through the same must of necessity find its way to a greater or less extent into the reservoir well. The. smelters in the vieinity also serve to ren der the water nnwhole.oome. The waterI in the wells near the smelter and slaugh ter house are entirely unfit for use. The committee unhesitatingly condemn the new supply. Fire at WValkerville. BUTTE, December 1.-Six houses were burned at Walkerville this morning at about half past three o'clock. Sullivan's boarding house, two frame buildings own ed by Milton Rog rs & Son, of Omaha, Dennis Driscoll's house, the Hiberma hall and Foo Lees' laundry. For a time the fire threatened to burn a good portion of the town, but by the active work of the Alice company's firemen, and by tearing down some small buildings it was confin ed to the limits described. Sullivan's loss is about $6,000, insured for $4,000. Hibernia hall, loss, $4,000; insured for $1,500. The loss on other buildings is about $8,000 with no insurance. The ori gin of the fire is not known. The de struction of Sullivan's place is in one re spect a blessing, as it war' built in a sort of sink hole and was most unhealthy. Three of Sullivan's boys have died here this fall from illness brought on by the unhealthful surroundings. * .- - Guarding Chqmnberlain. WASHINGTON, November 30.-Four Pinkerton detectives, employed by the British members, are guarding the British commissioners, and are keeping an es pecially vigorous eye on NMr. Chamberlain to see that some crank does not attempt to exterminate him. Mr. Chamberlain says he does not fear any violence. At night one of the detectives guards his sleeping apartments, and when he goes to his meals the Pinkerton detectives occu py seats at the adjoining table until he has finished, They are always around, and when he goes out for a walk or. drive they are always with him. When in his private apartments all callers upon Mr. Chamberlain or any of his party are cau tioned, questioned and observed by a de tective, who stands sentry at the foot of the stairway r Sullivan and Mitchell to Fight. LoNDON, November 29.-Sullivan and Mitchell were matched to-night to sight to a finish with bare knuckles for £500 a side. The date of the fight is not yet ar ranged. Fighting ifor the Advantage in the Senate. WASHINGTON, December 2.-The caucus of the democratic senators was held to day to which an informal report of the caucus committee was submitted respect ing a decision of the cases ,f, seniaors Turpie, of Indiana, and Faulkner, of West Virginia. The matter wIa diiaused it considerable length but no timi of action reached and the matter was put over un til to-morrow at 12 o'clock, to which hoir the aucus adjourned. The usual course of procedure is to swear in new senators, two at a time, in the order in which their names are on the alphabetical list. The two parties are exactly e·qual in strength at the start, but with =he administering of the oath to the first . enator on the list, Mr. Aldrich, the republicans will have a majority and can control the current of events if no delay in proceedings are re sorted to. Members of both parties are struggling closely and with a view t, checking any attempt by their opponents to secure an advantage. The democrats have caused telegrams to be sent to the absent, summoning them to be present to-morrow. The absent to-day wvere, sen ators George, Hearst, Blodgett. Hamptn, Gibson.

HELENA, December 3.---L. Scn'er. a railroad laborer, yesterday made a m: play at Jack Noland, a gambler, in an u;, town barber shop. He was orerpowered when about to tire and received a severe blow on the head with a poker, intiicte i by Noland. The melee was soon quieted by the arrival of officers who marched the combatants off to jail. In the afternoon they were examined by Magistrate Eng lish, resulting in the discharge of Noland and the conviction of his opponent. The latter was awarded 30 days in the county jail for bad behavior. More hood News !or Butte.

The President's Message. 

WASHINGTON, December 2.--Secretary Fairchild has completed the preparation of his annual report to congress. It gives his views in regard to the surplus and tar iff at considerable length. The pres.~- '. message will be sent to congress Tuesday. Suicide, DENVER, December 2.--Coroner C. iK. McHatton, one of the most popular me:: in this city, was found dead in bed to-day from the effects of an overdose of lauda num. The deceased had considerable do mestic trouble lately, and for several days and nights was unable to eat or sleep. It is thought that the drug, was taken to produce sleep, and not with suicidal in tent. He was a native of Louisville and in high standing in the order of Knights of Pythias. In Favor of the C. P. R. CHICAGO, December 2.-The deferential allowed by the American trans-contine:n tal lines to the Canadian Pacific is thirty cents on first class freight from New York: and 25 cents from Chicago to San Fran cisco. On other freights the deferentials in favor of the Canadian Pacific range from 25 cents to 5 cents. A Claim for Damages. HELENA, December 2.-In a case om: trial at Bozeman wherein the Northern Pacific is sued for the loss of a car load of horses, the defendant has brought a wit- ness from Texas to testify in its behalf. The plaintiff in the case is A. W. Haul. The horses were placed in a box car in stead of a stock car and while en route were smothered. Arensdorf's Last Hopes Disappearing. SIoux CITY, December 2.-To-day has been one of the most important days ir_ the trial of Arensdorf for the murder of Haddock. Hon. Byron Webster, of Du buque, United States revenue collector, testified that from about 10 o'clock until the fatal shot was fired on the night of the murder he was in Sheperd's saloor_ and restaurant and that Arensdorf was not there. The importance of this evidence consists of the fact that Sheperd's is the piace where Arensdorf locates himself at the moment of the murder and for some time before, and is a vital portion of the alibi. Retired on his Laurels. LONDON, December 2.-Advices from Melbourne say that Beach, the oarsman, has resigned the championship and re tired from aquatics, and that Hanlon has challenged Kemp.
