In considering the large Increase of revenue from distilled spirits for the last six months of the fiscal year ending June 1)0, 1869, the subjoined facts should be remembered. There were In bonded ware houses on 1st July, isos, as shown by the accounts kept in this oillce, 27,278,420 gallons of spirits. This included all claims for leakage then outstand ing, and a large quantity claimed to have been de stroyed by the burning of several bonded ware houses, as well oh certain amounts which had pre viously been withdrawn upon fraudulent bonds and were still unaccounted for. Under the provisions of the act of July 20, 18CS, as amended, all spirits in bonded warehouse at the time of the passage of the act were required to be withdrawn ami the tax paid thereon prior to July 1, 1869; and by this requirement 24,383,951 gallons of spirits were necessarily forced upon the market during this fiscal year, and served, to that extent, to Increase the revenue irom this source; while on the 1st of July, 1809, there remained in bonded ware house of the new product only 16,643,833 gallons. It thus appears that the quantity of spirits in bond, to bo withdrawn and tax paid during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1870,1s less by nearly eight million gallons than the quantity which was compelled to be withdrawn and tax paid for the llscal year ending June 30, 1K09.

Referring to the comparative statements of re ceipts for di Heron t periods so far as the samo relate to tobacco, I havo to say that, during tho first six months of the fiscal year 1809, the gain In cigars over the corresponding period for tho year 1808 was lifty-slx per cent. The loss on chewing and smoking tobacco for the same period was Ufteen per cent. ; the increased revenue from these articles under tho la of July 20, 1868, not being realized until after January 1, 1869, while on cigars tlie appreciation commenced Immediately after the passage of the law. The number of cigars returned for taxation during the last seven years is as follows: 1863, at an average tax of 12-31 per 1000. 199,283.21 1864, at an average tax of ti 37 per looo. 492,780,700 186,1, at an average tax of f 1 8-20 per 1000.. 93,2;io,8j I860, ata uniform tax of lo per looo. .. 847,443,894 1867, at an average tax of KO-60 'j per 1000. 43,8iia,4.10 189, at a uniform tax of (5 per looo rvjo,3:tr,,o.vj 1809, at a uuiform tax of f.l per looo 991,030,931 It will be seen that during I860, when thn tax was t a uniform rate of ten dollars per thousand, only 847,443,894 cigars weru returned for taxation, while under the present law there were returned for the year I860 nearly three times the quantity, with the tax at the uniform rate of five dollars per thousand. The amount of tax collected on cigars was for the fiscal year 1809 $1,9.17,079 1866 3,471,438 Knowing an increase of revenue on ono article for 18U over lsoc, at half tne rate of taxation, -of 11,43,241 Revenue SttiinpN.

This increase, though considerable, is by no means reckoned satisfactory. It has resulted mainly from the policy of this oillce, in April last, requiring all stamps to lie so placed ou thu Instrument of writing as to exhibit the entire face of the slump, and pro hibiting tho practice which had obtained oxleu slvely of covering the supposed half of one stamp by the attachment of another, when in fact the stamp was cut In two, and one-half used to represent a full stamp In another Instance. Tho gross receipts from stamps for the last fiscal year were 16,4?t710. For the current year they are estimated at $17,Nio,000, but It la believed that this tax ought lo yield at least I .lu, 1100,000. Incomes from Individual. The total amount collected on the annual list of incomes for 107 was 127,417,907 For 1808 23,390,373 For 1869 up to November 2.1,293,630 This last sum will bo increased to an amount over twenty-six millions. As this tax expires with the assessment for 1870, it will be for Congress tu dotcriulno whether we can part entirely with the receipts from this source of revenue; and, If not, whether any substitute van be devised more Just and equitable, and less burden some to taxpayers. If the Income from this source cannot ba spared from the general receipts, and other objects cannot be lound more acceptable as a substitute, it Is for Congress to determine whether or not the tax shall be renewed. In considering this nuectlon, after determining the total amount which ouuht to be realized from Inter nal revenue sources, and considering carefully what will lie realized by the present system, without re sorting to lucernes, the question will present Itself, whether the entire income tax, as now assessed, shall be revived, or whether it shall be renewed at a less rate of taxation. My opinion is that, so long as a large Internal revenue is required by the financial necessities of the Government, a portion of that revenue should be collected from Incomes. Tho reasons for this seem apparent and forcible. This tax reaches simply the prollts of trade and business, and the Increased wealth of individuals from invest ments. If the tax were paid as these prollts and accumulations accrue, it Is believed that It would be thonght objectionable, tint, lining required to lie paid all at one time, and often Bfter the Income has been reduced by the expenses of tho taxpayer, or lein vested In business, it seems more onerous, and is more seriously complained against. The objection most frequently and earnestly made against this tax Is that It leads to a system of espi onage Into private affairs that Is not only offensive but sometimes Injurious to Individuals. I do not see why this objection mny not, with equal force, be urged against all taxes upon personal property. Such taxes cannot be collected without ascertaining tho amount of taxable property pos sessed by the tax-payer. The law imposing a tax upon incomes does nothing more than this, If so much. It simply requires a truthful and honest statement of the actual Income of the tax-payer during the preceding year, which can be compfled with us easily, and wiih as little exposure of private affairs, as any other law national, state, or muni cipal which seeks to raise revenue from the per sonal estate of tax-payers. After all. It Is but a tax upon the increased wealth of the nation; and when It Is understood that Gov ernment securities are exempted from taxation, and that the interest on these securities produces a large amount of the Income of taxpayers, I sulVaiit if it will be wise to abolish the Income tax so long as the labor, Industry, and business of thn country are directly or indirectly subjocted to any considerable taxation. Expenses of foiled Ing the Revenue. There were paid for expenses incident to the collection of the revenue for 1803 js, 770,814 For 1N69 17,394,395 Deduct the amount paid to store keepers, act of July 20, 18CS 603,018 Leaving for this year on the basis of the ac count for 1808 6,785,477 Decrease In favor of 1869 $1,991,337 By an amendment to the act of July 20, 1803, passed March 4, 1869, the compensation of storekeepers Is to be repaid to the Government by the manufactu rers of distilled splrltB aod owners of warehouses. These repayments are found to be (lilllcult to collect, and I am of opinion that this mode of paying store keepers should be abolished at once. Only 1175,785 of the amount expended by the Government for this purpose had been repaid on the 80th of June, 1809. The accounts of this bureau do not show precisely the expenses of collecting the revenue for each year, because the amounts charged during each year em brace expenses actually Incurred in the preceding year. The expenses or the bureau for the year 1868 were 1567,214 Deduct the cost of printing stamps, and for tent 150,000 Actual expenses of the bureau for 1868. . 417,214 Fxpenscs for the year 1869 1050.395 Deduct for printing stamps, etc 250,000 Actual expenses 400,395 Decrease In favor of 1809. 16.819 Prior to the act of July 20, 1868. no stamps for dis tilled spirits and tobacco were required.

INTERIOR. Annual Report of Secretary Cox- Operations of His Department During the Year The In dian Question and its Present Aspect. From the lengthy report of General Jacob D. Cox, Sccretaiy of the Department of the Interior, which was transmitted to Congress at noon to-day, we take the following extracts, embracing the most material portions of the document: During the last fiscal year public lands were dis posed of, by cash sales, ami by grants for home steads, railroads, etc, to the amount, of 7,6iiO,Ml-97 acres, a quantity greater by 1,010,409-47 acres than was disposed of the previous year. An appropriation of $,'s4,420 for tho Patent Oillce the coming year is asked for. It is estimated that, exclusive of the amount chargeable to the navy-pension fund, 30,ooo,ooo will be required for the pension service during the next llscal year. In the matter of the new policy towards the In diau tribes, the Secretary suggests the following I unoerstaud this policy to look to two objects: First, the locatlou of the Indians upon fixed reser vations, so that tlie pioneers and settlers may bo freed from tho terrors of wandering hostile tribes; and, second, an earnest effort at their civil i.miou, so that they may themselves be elevated lu the sealo of humanity, and our obligation tu them as fellow-men be discharged. In carrying out this policy a great practical diffi culty has arisen from the fact that in most instances a separate reservation was given to each tribe. These reservations have been surrounded and gra dually Invaded by tho white settlers, and the Indians crowded out of their homes, acd forced to negotiate for a new settlement, because their presence, tlielr habits, ami their manners were distasteful to their new and more powerful neighbors. 1 It is believed that the only remedy for this condi tion of things is to encourage the Indiana to as semble upon larger reservations, where their num bers will be aggregated, and where the more civi lized of them vtill iniluence the others in striving to progress In the arts of peace. Congress has already passed an act to enuble the civilized Indians of the Indian Territory, properly so called, to form a gene ral organization, with most of the elements of a ter ritorial government; but the requisite appropria tions have not been made to carry the plan Into effect. 1 would earnestly recommend that no further delay be made in this matter. Tho associ ated tribes, of which the Chorokees have taken the lead, aie those best fitted for a fuller experiment In self-government. They are already familiar with mostjof the forms of executive, legislative, and ju dicial action in use among us, and 1 believe them well prepared to dispense with the tutelage of our agents, if they may havo a dologiite of ftielr ovy,i upon the iloor of thu House of Hcpre.senlatlves to speak for them, JJoto they and we ore suffering for tho lack of such direct representation. The white constituencies which are nearest to thorn are tho ones of all the nation whose interests are most lu opposition, and whose personal tendencies are most host ile to lnoirs. The representatives of such constituencies would be more tliau human If they were not tntlueuccd by this fact, ltcprcsentatlon chosen by tho tribes tlieiu-s-dves, aud responsible to themselves, is the only mode of making tho country acquainted with their condition aud with our obligations to them, lu such a territory the tribal organization would easily merge into thu county, and the territorial legislature would not bo very different from the grand councils at present in vogue among them. The Indians north of the Platte river are not yet prepared lor a similar concentration; but the time cannot be far distant when two or three principal ludiun territories may properly embrace all the tribes cast of the Kooky Mountains. Without such a system they will Inevitably go through the old processor being first surrounded aud then over whelmed and destroyed by the white immigration. As they advance in intelligence they will need no urging to adopt this plan, for they will see as plainly as we that the existence of their race depends upon it. The same policy of concentrating tho tribes will apply to tho country wcBtof the Kocky Mountains, and will be equally necessary whenever aud wher ever the feuds existing among them can be so far settled that they can live together in peaceful neigh borhood. I'pou such permanent reservations farms should be allotted in severalty as soon as any dispo sition to agriculture Is awakeued, aud every induce ment offered to stimulate the desire for property of a fixed character. The late peace commission negotiated trtSa'los with all the principal tribes east of the lto ky Mountains, and were guided in their action by the general views stated above, which, Indeed, may be said to have been accepted by all disinterested persons who have had any opportunity of examining the subject. The treaties were duly ratified, and so became the solemn contract between tho United States and those tribes. It is rteeplv to be regretted that specific appropriations were not made to carry out strictly the terms of the treaties ; for.allhough tho general appropriation of two millions has tieen used as far as possible in thn fulfilment of the obligations incurred, the .Commissioner of Indian A (lairs has been met at every step by distrust of the good faith of the Government, aud all pro mises regarding the future have m?en doubtingly received and ai swered by the Inquiry, whnt agree ment could be more blurting than that mado under the authority of Congress by so distinguished Eersonages as the ambassadors of the United Stata7 verythlng attending tho Peace Commission was of a nature to excite the Imaginations of the Indians, and to Impress them wltn the belief that now, more than ever belore, we were thoroughly In earnest lu our negotiations. The disappointment is propor tlonally great, and the comparative quiet whicn has l een maintained throughout the year could only have lioen secured by greatly increased care and un tiring effort on the part of the officers of the Indian Durcau and of the army officers, who have co ope rated with the greatest zeal la acrrylng out a peace ful policy. The report shows that the sum of 12,075,892-89 was requisite to defray the expenses of tho Courts of the I'inted States for the llscal year ending June 30, I38.I. In addition to the estimated receipts from lines, penalties, and forfeitures, tl,2on,noo will he required for tills service during the next liscal year. This snm Is less by 1300,000 than that appropriated for tho present year. in relation to appointments In the civil service the Secretary remarks: The first measure of reform Is to raise the standard ol quiillilcatlon, make merit as tested by the duty performed the solo ground of promotion, and secure to the faithful incumbent the same permanence of employment that Is given to officers of the army and navy. Under the present system, the general conviction among the clerks and employes is that the retention of their places depends much more upon the political iniluence they may command that npon energy or seal In the per formance of duty. After a careful examination of the subject, I am fully persuaded that the measure I have suggested would have enabled this depart ment to do the work of thepaxt llscal year with a corps of clerks one-third less in number than were found necessary. 

POSTAL. Annual Report of Postmaster-General Creswell Our Gigantic Mail Sys tem Its Operations During the Fast Year The Franking Privi lege. a From the annual report transmitted to Congress at noon to-day by tho lion. J. A. J. Creswell, Postmaster-General, wo take the following extracts, which embrace all the points or general Interest : The ordinary revenues of the Postal Department for the fiscal year ended June 80, 1809, were $18,344,510-72, and the expenditures t23,098,i31'60. The estimated expenditures for the year ending June 80, 1371, are 12.1,581,093 The revenues, estimated at 10 per cent. Increase over last year. 120,178,901 Standing appropriations for free matter 700,000 : , 20,878,961 Leaving a deficiency of 4,702,132 The lore going estimates do not Include tho special appropriations in the nature of subsidies for mail Bteamship service between ton Francisco, Japan, and China; for like service between the 'United Slates aud Brazil; and for like service between Ban Francisco and Sandwich Islamls. The total number of postage stamps, stamped en velopes, and newspaper wrappers was 502,722,bG0, of the aggregate value or l.o7S,001-fo. Tho amount expended for new mail bags of all kinds was vj,42i, or 131,4 13-13 more than the amount expended the preceding year. Tho cost of mail-bag catchers, re cently introduced into the service for delivering and receiving malls from and on railway trains at full speed, was tiooo. Tills anion ut does not appear lu the table last mentioned, but is included in thu item or mall bags. "Since the completion or the railroad line to the Pacific, arrangements have been made to have re cords kept showing the time occupied iu the transit or malls rrom Washington, New York, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, and St. Louis to Denver City, Salt Lake City. Sacramento city, and San Francisco and back. The records or arrivals on the Atlantic side during tho month or October havo reached the department. They show that malls are carried through rrom San Francisco to Washington in 6 days, 23 hours, and 15 minutes; to New York in 6 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes; to liostou In 7 davs, 4 hours; to Chicago in & days, 7 houri, anil 30 minutes; to Cincinnati In 5 days, 22 hours, aud 30 minutes; and to St. Louis In 5 days, 1 hour, and 30 minutes. The above figures show the time of the shortest trips. The total number of letters passing between the United States and foreign countries (Canada ex cepted) during the lost year was 12 590,054, of which 6,638 858 were sent from, and 6,957,796 received In, the United States. The increase over the number exchanged in 1868 is 1,403,122. Estimating the num ber exchanged with the Dominion of Canada, or which no accurate account is reported, at 3,000,000, the whole number or letters exchanged lu tne mails Willi foreign countries exceeded 15,5o0,000. Tile total postages on letters exchanged with foreign coun tries, estimating tho postage on letters to aud Iroin Canada at $350,000, amounted to $2,014,1S3,15. The free-delivery system has been In operation during the year in forty-eight of the principal cities, with the following aggregate results: Number of letter-carriers 1,248 Wail letters delivered 80,071,nw Local letters delivered 18,3-.0,027 Newspapers delivered 21,9.14,898 Letters collected 89,885,009 Amount paid carriers, including inci dental expenses $I,183,91.1-.H Postage on local matter $000,107-42 This shows an Increase over last year of Letter carriers 48 Mail letters delivered 15,730,500 Local lctteis delivered 4,298,721 Newspapers delivertd 6.044,183 Letters collected 20,720,31 Amount paid carriers, including incidental expenses $187,930-72 Postages on local mutter 19ii,is5-oo Tlic number of the several classes of letters, do mestic and foreign, received at the dead letter oillce during the last llscal year was as follows: Domestic letters, classed as Ordinary 9,S37,472 Drop 450,000 l uiunllable 801,934 Hotel 20,528 Fictitious 17,417 Heglstered 8,072 Keturued from foreign countries 62,0M3 Total domestic letters ". 8,7.ij,670 Foreign letters 103, lbO Whole number 8,952,802 The largely increased use of stamped envelopes bearing "return requests," that Is, requests that they be returned to the writers al ter a stated number of days, has operated to decrease lu a considerable degree the number of dead letters. While the num ber and value or money letters received are about the samo as those or tho preceding year, the per centage or decrease In letters containing other valuables ranges as follows; IVr cent. Letters containing bills of exchsngo, drafts, hecks, deeds, and other valuable pupeis... 19-85 Letters containing Jewelry and other property 63-94 Letters containing articles of small value, postage stamps, photographs, etc nr, Ordinary letters without lnclosures 11-92 Ordinary letters and circulars destroyed 74-14 The whole number of money order Post Offices lu operation during the last llscal year was 1408. Two or these were discontinued, aud 219 new meney order offices were established July 12, 1809, making the present whole number 10-6: The number or orders Issued during the year was 1,264,143, or the aggregate valuo or $24,848,060 The number paid was 1,218,874, amounting In value to $24,447,377 To which should be added thu amount or orders repaid to purchasers 200,747 ' 24,654,123 Excess or Issues over payments i3,B34 The Postmaster-General mentions the fact that no American vessels are engaged in the foreign mail service, and makes the folia in? tetnarks: Propositions have been made to this department by parties represented as responsible and ex e rlenced In ocean steam navigation to contract fo the conveyance of the Unltei states malls 10 European ports by Ami rican Heara hips of the Or t flln.a iml (if Annul KnpfVl to th fi&tj.kff mtan mat. nw carrying the malls, at a compensation limited to the ! amount 01 sea posmgen, upon condition tnat the department should bind Itself for a long term or years, mbject to the approval f Ciiigre; and some nave offered In thM 1 ounociion to fix the rate or sea postage at two cents per half ounce Hut, at the general law relating to contracts for carrying the malls on the seas expressly limits the authority of the department to a term not exceeding two year, I have declined all propt s.iU to contract for a longer time, not desiring In any manner to forestall tho action or Congress upon a subject or so much im portance. If It be possible, I should greatly prerer such legis lation by Congress us would so far revive and en courage our own ship-building Interests as to en able American builders and mechanics to enter into active compeilt'.on in the construction and equip, ment of steam vessels with the builders and me chanics of other countries. If, however, it should be decided that this cannot be done, then I would respectfully suggest tho propriety of so modifying our navigation laws as to authorize the Issuing of American registers to such foreign-built steamers as may be purchased aud employed by citizens of the I 'nited States under contracts with this department in the transportation of our foreign malls. Should either of these recommendations bo adopted, and authority given to the I'osimastr (eneral to contract ror the conveyance or 11111II3 by cea for a term of ten or fifteen years, at a compensa tion not to exceed the ocean postages, It la believed that lines of first-class American steamers w nld be speedily established for the conveyan -e of our mu'U and freights across the Atlantic, and that there. v great bcncilts would Inure to the commercial anil other Interests of tho United States.

Thero are present more members than was anticipated. The galleries aro crowded, liotwithntaudlng the pelting rain and dis rrial weather. After prayer by Rev. Dr. Duller, the tlcrk proceeded to call the roll. f ream In the Hennte. Notwithstanding tho Inclement weather a goodly assembly was gathered In the Senate Chamber be fore noon to witness the opening of tho second ses-?i-VV .1th0 1'0rtT-,"',t Congress. More than one-ha-f of tho spectators were ladies. Senators com menced coming lu on tho floor about 11 o'clock, and hearty congratulations were exchanged between those who had been parted for so many months. Hie vacant chair of Mr. Fcssendcn was often glanced at, and a sad expression swept across the fac. s or his surviving brothers at the memory or ouo who was gone rrom among them roicvcr. One thing was particularly nottceable.and In marked contrast to the opening or the sessions ror last four veara Then Senators met each other with Btern aiid contracted brows, and gathered together In excited little knots, discussing "the man at the other end or lite avenue,' and how best U) circumvent his plans and purposes. To-day all was smiles and serenity ; no whispers, no fierce ejaculations. 4 III V U K i: N N. 

FOUTV-KIK8T TKItM SECOND KESSION. Senate. W'AsrtiNOTON, Dec. ft. The Senate met at noon, with tifty-tlve members present. The resignation of Senator Crimes was received. Mr. Ixit M. Morrill was sworn In as Senator from Maine. The credentials of the Virginia Senators were pre sented and laid on the table. A committee was appointed to inform the House and the President or the Senate's readiness to proceed tv business. A large number or bills were introduced and ordered to bo printed, among them bills by Messrs. Drake and Sumner, restricting appellate powers or United States Courts in tho late rebellious States, and by Mr. Morton to provide ror the reconstruction or (ieorgla. on motion Mr. Kditrand's bill on the same subject, reported last session, was mado the special order ror next Wednesday. The Senate at 12-50 took a recess ror half an hour. House. The IIousc was called to order by the Speaker at noon, when the proceedings were opened with prayer by tho chaplain, Rev. Mr. Butter. The roll or mcmiiers was then called by States by the clerk, and a large majority answered to their names. The roll having been completed the Speaker announced that there were 180 members present. Mr. Brooks (N. Y.) presented as a question or privilege the credentials or S. S. Cox, member-elect rrom New York. The Speaker stated that there were several gentle men present, Including Messrs. Cox, or New York, Harnum, or Connecticut, li rooks, of Massachusetts, and the members-elect from Alabama, who had not been sworn in; and he invited all or them whose rights to Beats were unchallenged to present them selves and take the oath at the same time. Mr. Paine suggested that perhaps tho better mode would bo to make a rormal reference or the creden tials or all those members to the Committee on Elec tions. Tho Speaker remarked that his suggestion had been that only those members whoso credentials were absolutely unchallenged should present them selves, and that he would not administer the oath to any member against whom ail objection should bo made. The usage had always been to allow mem bers to be sworn in against whom thero was no ob jection, without rurther ceremony. Mr. Brooks remarked that iu point or fact the cre dentials of Mr. Cox had been presented early in March last, unchallenged, aud Mr. Cox had been ac tually appointed by the Speaker as a member or the Committee on Hanking and Currency. Mr. Paine said he did not object to any individual member. He had only suggested a general rule which ho thought ought to be adhered to. The several members elect then presented them selves at the bar to take the oath or oillce. Mr. Kelley objected to the swearing in or Mr.Sher rod or Alabama, and Mr.Whittemore objected to the swearing in or Mr. Dox or Alabama, and those gentlemen were directed to stand aside. The oath was then administered to Mesirs. Bar num, or Conn. ; Brooks, or Mass. ; Cox, or N. Y. ; Burchard, or III., and Buck and Barclay or Ala. On motion or Mr. Schenck, the Clerk was directed to inform the Senate that a quorum or tho House had assembled, and that the House was ready to proceed to business. On motion or Mr. Schenck, a committee or three was ordered to join a similar committee or the Senate to wait npon the President or the United States and Inform him that Congress had assembled and was ready to receive any communication ho might he pleased to make. The Speaker appointed as such committee Messrs. Schenck, Dawes, and Woodward. Mr. Schenck then moved that the House take a recess until half-past one o'clock. Hesuld It had formerly been the usage for Congress to wait until it heard rrom the President before pro ceeding to any legislative business, and he thought it well to return to that old custom, and to observe that same deoorom and courtesy which had formerly prevailed. There had been reason;durluga few years past more satisfactory to gentlemen for changing that pructl e, and It had fallen Into disuse, but he trusted that they would go back to the old land mark. During the delivery or these remarks there were symptoms on the Democratic sido or a readiness to get up a discussion. Just then a message was re ceived rrom the Senate that it had appointed a com mittee to wulton thy President. Mr. Schenck, ichiunlning the floor after tho mes sage from the Senate was delivered, said that, for fear the House might get Into a discussion as to the reasons ror departing rrom that custom or bite years, he would move the previous question. (Laughter.) The previous question was seconded, and the mo tion was agreed to.. The House thereupon, at 12V o'clock, took a re-cc-fiH till hair-past 1.
