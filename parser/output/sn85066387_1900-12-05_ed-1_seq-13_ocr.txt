States forces In China. General Breckin ridge also notes that the grade of briga dier general is abolished In most of the European armies and is nearly as archaic as that of commodore afloat. In regard to the question of the reor ganization of the standing- army the gen eral suggests a standard of two soldiers per 1000 of population and submits statis tics to show that in the proportion of sol diers to population, and to the area of country, and in the war budget in time of peace, the United States Is far. behind all of the great European nations.' \ . General Breckinridge claims for his de partment the credit of the discovery of postal frauds in Cuba. He makes recom mendation for additional clerical and mes senger assistance in his department, and also earnestly suggests that the War De partment provide the various military colleges throughout the country with cap able and efficient military instructors. Inspector General J. C. Breckinridge Presents His Annual Report ->•*-/-. to the War Secretary. WASHINGTON pec. 4.— The report o'f General J. C. Breckinridge, inspector general of the army, earnestly recom mends that the benefits of the law of March 3, 1S99, providing 1 for the retirement of officers of the navy, under certain con ditions, with the rank and pay of -the neit higher grade, be extended to include officers of the army.-" ¦ Mostof our wars have been fought on land, says the report, and as a matter of simple justice, rewards for army . officers should be no less extensive than those en- Joyed by officers of thu naval branch. The report touches also upon the disad vantages Imposed by Inferior rank In the army, citing as an Instance the China campaign, when General Chaffee, a junior among the commanders, was advanced from a brigadier to a major general to give him the rank requisite to his status as commander-ln-chlef of the United RECOMMENDS CHANGES IN AHHTY BETHtEMENTS BERLIN, Dec- 4.— Many of the Import ant Journals, like the Post, Tageblatt and National Zeitung, . refrain from comment on President McKinley's message/Other papers speak of the wid, '¦ even threatening language it is said to contain In regard to Germany. The Vosslsche Zeitung- says: "It is noticeable "that President McKinley refers very , coolly to . America's . relations with Germany.- As in important state docu ments of this kind every word has been carefully read beforehand, it is un doubtedly significant that President Mc- Kinley should describe the relations with France and England as friendly,, whereas, speaking of relations- with Germany, he merely remarks that they show 'evidence Of good will.* Such a distinction cannot but be intended and is «U1 the more sur prising In view of the very friendly speech to Germans delivered' by Embassador White at the Thanksgiving dinner of the American colony." • . 

LONDON, Dec. 4.-*-Comment on Presi dent McKinley's message to Congress is chiefly -devoted to 'the references to America's Chinese policy. The-. Dally Graphic says: "The policy of the -United States regarding China is not heroic, but it is certainly practical and there.ls ample reason to believe that it will prevail." The Times says: , "The message makes It clear that on the vital point of insist ing upon punishment -for the outrages Mr. McKinley remains firm. We are glad to see that on the subject of guarantees for Christian . converts the President makes a new proposal in advance of any put forward elsewhere. In regard to the indemnity question he is in agreement with some of the best opinion in Eng land." The Times editorially concludes with an expression of the hope "that Mr. McKinley's second term may be marked by "a satisfactory settlement of all out standing questions between Great Britain and America.". • The Daily News says: ' '"The message contains nothing new t and nothing very illuminating on matters that are old. It will be very closely scanned for its ref erences to China. Jt looks as though the American formula were ' that the powers are to specify the culprits and .the Chi nese Government is to specify the pun ishment. On such terms a speedy settle ment would undoubtedly be possible, but would it be effective or durable?" The Standard, which agrees with the Times that if all the powers had with drawn after the legations were relieved to the same extent as the United States there would not now be much chance of satisfaction, remarks: "The excessive anxiety to re-establish trade with China is, perhaps, the real explanation of some points that have not seemed satisfactory in the recent policy of the United States. In the opinion of the Standard, the Washington Government has "acted aa a drag on European diplomacy." The Daily Chronicle observes: "Clearly the United States Government is able to boast of a,n aggregate of imports and ex ports exceeding- two billions, and to pro pose a reduction of revenue taxation to the extent of thirty mllllons. : The admin istration has a fair justification, even if there be no very obvious need, for fur ther, encouraging the American mercan tile marine."
