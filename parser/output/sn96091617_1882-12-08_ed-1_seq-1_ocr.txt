The Republicans of this, tho Sec ond Congressional District, are now united 1 The Knoxville Chronicle, hereto fore, the mouthpeiee of the "de cent, sober and moral Republi cans" in this District, has been sold, for filthy lucre, to the "Phil listincs," i- c., tho "lloukites," the men who represented the princi ples (whatever they were) that wcic strongly, bitterly, vindictive ly and uanLKssiA opposed by such men as we forbear, and will not mention names, for have not the erring ones returned to the door of the great Republican household, and, looking wistfully through the portals, piteously beg to be re-admitted under the old roof even if they have to pick up tho crumbs that fall from the table? The late fight by tho "Great Moral Reformers" has ended in smoke ! The opposition gained the victo ry ! "Decency, morality and sobrie ty" are laid on the shelf! What is the the result? Ans wer: The pure patriots, who lott ed (?) decency, sobriety and mor ality, harmonize with the element they affected to despise, "for the good of the party," you know ! Deductions: Wo had rather favor "IToukim" as "Ruluism.' Why? Because Ilouk's issue was plain and Honest; the opposition's war-crv was that of the "outs," who wanted "in," as subsequent oven's clearly proves. The men who made such a fu riouswaron Houk now virtually admit that they sought to mislead tho people through the purest, holiest and best feelings of the human heart 1 Now let the brass band play and the monkeys grin, for "all is love ly and the goose" ah,! and there's the rub ! Where's tho goose? Whose goose is "cooked?" The Knoxville Chronicle, has been purchased by a joint stock company of Houk men, with Col Henry R. Gibson as editor-in-chief, Capl. Wm. Rule retiring. Tho new company is a strong one, and the new editorial manage ment have the brains and tho en ergy to make the Chronicle a good newspaper and an effective party organ. The paper already shows sign.? of improvement. While we always have and ex pect to continue., to oppose Col. Gibson's politics, as a man and as a political opponent he is bold and vigorous, and is successful in all his undertakings. His indomita ble pluck and perseverance and his vigorous brain will yet make him a "power" in his party. ' The editor of the Watchman gracefully acknowledges his errors and bows at the shrine of Repub licanism. His harmonican makes sweet music. One by one the prodigals are returning, and the Democrats who bolstered the bolt er's cause on high moral prin ciples arc stranded. To them wo say, in imitation of our Ropubli- 11 i T 1 1 1' can iciiow-citizens ! Jei s ue friends, and unite in solid phalanx against our common foe. Demo crats, friends, countrymen and brethren, come to the rescue of the Democrat. Our bazoo is in good tune. Come ! ,. MAIIYVILLE, TENET., THURSDAY, DEC. The policy of tho new Knoxviilc Chronicle is peace and good will towards all the erring brethren. The Chattanooga Democrat has enlarged to nine columns to the page. The unprecedented success of this paper is deserved. Congress reassembled last Mon day The President's Message is lengthy and well written, touching many needed reforms and ques tions of public interest. President Arthur is a sound thinker and a statesman when forced by the cold logic of party defeat to demon strate the fact. We predict that under the man agement of Col. Gibson the Re publican organ at Knoxville will be more influential and the party more triumphant than ever. The Democrats had better arouse from their lethargic leop and put in some effective licks for 1831. The stockholders of the new Knoxville Chronicle are said to be Col. II. R. Gibson, Rev. Geo. W. LeVcrc, lion. L. C. Houk. Col. J. M. Melton, Hon. 0. P. Temple, F. R. dcTavenicr and Col. Isham Young, all influential, highly re spected and worthy citizens. Capt. Wm. Rule retires from the field of journalism with the best wishes of the Dic.voop.at. He made a gallant fight for Congres sional honors, and after years of faithful toil for his party ho wns badly beaten by a man who start ed out in life under 'the most un favorable circumstances but who has by his talents and energy won fame and fortune. Monday next is Chancery Court, when we hero to meet a large num ber of our old patrons and several new ones, whose times have expired, we feel confident that we will get an increased circulation Monday, and hope to increase our already rapidly growing circulation at least one hun dred new subscribers. We 'have re cieved in tlio last few weeks great encou ragciiient, for which we feel thankful to our friends through out the county. The Democrat wiil be more interesting the coming year than it has been in the past, and as we have in the past relied upon the people and they have invar'a'jly sus tained as, wc chail trust. ihem for the future and know all will he well if we only make (lie necessary efforts to please our patrons. . Mr. M. II. Gillespie, a worthy citi zen of our county and a good ai.d true Democrat, is a candidate for Door keeper of the next House. J. 7. Gil lespie, uncle of M.

Away back in the forties, wc believe about 1814, so runs the story, tho Dem ocratic organ in Indiana was conduct ed by Bird B. Chapman, a politician of somo repute. It was a season ol political activity, and tho Democrats were rather despondent, as the tide seeded against them. At some local election preliminary to the ircnoral election in tho State, the Democrats unexpectedly scooped the Whigs, and a letter from an active Democrat communicating the news to the editor began with the injunction, "Crow, Chapman, crow." Sure enough, Chap man did crow, and using these words as a head-hue. in his next day's ed ition, lirst introduced the Democratic rooster as the harbinger of victory. The idea was a taking 0110, and the symbol was quickly accepted and came into general use, at least when the Democrats gained something to crow over. A Boston editor bounced tho cook cuffed two children, left his wife in tears, and mado a bee-lino for the office, and wrote: If you want to make the world brighter and better, begin by being kind and loving to thoeo in tho smull circle of your own family, and from that us a center work out as you arc permitted to go."
