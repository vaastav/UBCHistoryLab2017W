BANKS TO BLAME. A Lively Discussion Over the Bartlett Resolution. The Bartlett national bank resolution •was the stated subject tor discussion at yesterday's meeting of the board ot trade, notwithstanding whicii no de cision was reached,' and it went over for final action at the next meeting. At the request of the board, Mr. Bart lett restated the salient features of his plan, in describing which he said that while the banKs of the city have a cap italization of $5,450,000, they have in circulation less than $300,000, about one dollar in eighteen of their capitalization. He claimed that the banks had gone out of the business of supplying the people with currency, and hence the necessity of action by congress. Arguments were made by William Hill, of Hill & Sons; Mr. Nailer, of the Union National bauk; F. P. Powell and Maj. Bassett. Mr. Hill claimed that the national banks themselves were largely to blame for the recent financial stringency, and that their hatred of silver was largely at the bottom of the trouble, He declared that the free coinage of silver would remedy the troubles of the country very greatly. The New York cry of "Down with silver," and tiie fact that the New York banks were for free trade, as they are for the gold basis, was largely to blame for the condition of the country. He had been at the Pacific coast for a long time, and the condition of that part of the country and the Puget sound country was deplorable. Mr. Nailor thought that Mr. Baatlett's scheme was in the main a step in the right direction. But his own idea was to have the country return to the safety fund system, as formerly in operation in New York, substantially the sys tem of Canada, under which the na tional comptroller would issue to banks 40 to 50 per cent of their paid in capital in currency, the banks to pay to a safety" fund I}_ to 2 per cent of the amount for the safety lund lor the cases of Josses. For elasticity there could be a "marked is sue" of 30 or 40 per cent, taxed suffici ently to make it certain that it would . be recalled as soon as the emergency of the issue was over. THE ROAD HEARD FROM. Proposed Conference Over the Scheme to Lower the Milwaukee Tracks. The Milwaukee road has written a Communication to City Attorney Simpson requesting the privilege or a conference regarding the proposed lowering of the Milwaukee tracks.about which there has been such a bitter and animated controversy. The communication, which will be considered by the committee on rail roads, which meets Friday night, is as follows: "Since your notification of Sept. 0, re quiring the Milwaukee railway com pany, within thirty days thereafter, to begin lowering and bridging its tracks in your city, in conformity r to a report and plans adopted by your city council on the 25th day of August last, we have had the matter under thoughtful con sideration. "Aside from the amount ot expense, which that report, we think, much un derestimates—perhaps from want of full familiarity with all the details of such a work in their relation to an oper ated railroad— we discern such engi neering difficulties in the execution of those plans as to render them, in our judgment, impracticable. "Desiring a continuance of the pleas ant relations which have heretofore pre vailed between your city and our com pany, we should be pleased to confer with representatives of your city, in cluding your engineer, with a view to agreement upon some system of im provement sufficient for" the needs of your people and less injurious to our company. "We will meet you in such conference at any time after the lSth inst., and then be prepared to submit a proposi tion and plans." / "WOULD NOT TALK TURKEY. Clerk of the Supreme Court Hol comb Shy on Politics. Charles 11. Holcomb, the genial clerk it the supreme court, called on his Min neapolis friends "yesterday afternoon, but.when seen by a Globe reporter, he said that he was not talking politics. Speaking of the recent gathering of Republican sachems at the Nicollet house, an exclusive account of which appeared in the Sunday Globe, and in wliich his name was mentioned as a' probable candidate to succeed himself, he said that he did not care to discuss the situation, as it was a little early iv the game, and- then his well - known modesty would preclude anything of the kind". Strictly on the dead, however, he acknowl edged that in the event of L. P. Hunt, of Mankato, being a candidate for state auditor, he thought the latter's chances for the nomination were first-class, and from a Republican standpoint he be lieved he would have a walk-over. Mr. Holcomb is something of a diplomat, and if he carries any secrets locked up in his expansive bosom it is safe, to say that no disclosures will be made until the proper time comes. McAllister Is Cornered. Mayor Eustis Issued orders yesterday to the police department to investigate the buildings which Aid. McAllister says harbor gambling rooms. lt is well known that McAllister's motion Is a libel upon the owners of several of the buildings named, and McAllister admits that he may have been wrong "in cer tain respects." The probability is that the council will sit down on him at the next meeting, and should the major attempt to roast the council in his com munication upon the subject, the "com bine" will sit on his honor, too. "Wanted to Die. Pedro Blrdon, an Italian, who came to Minneapolis about four weeks ago, made yesterday what looks to be a highly successful attempt to end his life. He shot himself in the neck with a revolver. Birdon boarded at 110 First Btreet northeast, and it is supposed that failure to obtain work caused him to commit the deed. He was taken to the city hospital, and late last night it was reported that his chances for recovery were improving. * . iffZf. Demur toKiichii's Complaint.

AN INTERESTING CONTEST AS TO WHO WILL SUCCEED JUDGE CANTY ON THIS DISTRICT COURT BENCH Several Well Known Gentlemen Would Not Object to Wearing His Mantle— Benjamin Daven port Appears to Have the Hearty Support of His Party for the Place. In a very few days now Judge Canty, of the district court bench, will! vacate his seat to occupy a [position on tho su preme bench, to which he. was elected at the iate election. A lively interest is taken by the members of the legal fra ternity of Hennepin county as to who will succeed to his mantle, and as the' retiring judge is a Democrat it is natu ral that those of this political faith should' look upon, the plum with longing, The appointment of his successor will be made by Gov. Gov. Nelson, and while it would be in accordance with precedents, and a graceful compliment for tha latter to name a Democrat, still a majority of the. party would doubtless be opposed to ac cepting tl -; office if it is to be handi capped by pledges of the partisan judiciary stamp, and which would hamper the action of the forth coming convention. There are three prominent candidates named for the position, viz., Benjamin Davenport, Judge Mahoney and F. C. Brooks, all of whom are gentlemen of culture, wide experience and undoubted judicial acumen. Relatively speaking, and if the wishes of the profession are to be relied upon as a guide, it is understood that Mr. Davenport is in the lead, and he also has the support of the local organizations, such as the city and county committees. With regard to Brooks, a well-known local politician said last night that his friends were too ready in pledging their support to assist in nominating three Republican judges, when the time comes, in the event of his appointment now. The friends of Judge Mahoney are not saying much, but they continue to saw wood. _ This week another delegation of local statesmen will call upon Gov. Nelson to further urge the appointment of Daven port. The contest is a quiet one, but none the less, ardent, and the outcome will be watched with interest. FIGHTING TYPHOID FEVER. The Board of Health Preparing to Stamp It Out. The board of health met yesterday afternoon and discussed the typhoid fever problem. The prevalence of this disease during the past four months has beeu such as to excite great alarm. The analyses of the well water, which Dr. Drew has been making by order of the board, show that a majority of the cases can be traced to this cause, though not by any means all. It is rumored that the river water is not as pure as it ought to be. The typhoid fever report of the health department for August, September, October and November records 783 cases of typhoid fever, and 86 deaths. September was the worst month, its record showing 251 cases and 27 deaths. The total number of cases for the entire year up to Dec. I. is 1,859, and the deaths 125. Of the 738 cases of typhoid fever, which is. the record for the past four mouths, 404 used well water. The board of' health discussed the matter at some length, but decided to postpone all action until the next meet ing which will take place tomorrow aft ernoou at 2 o'clock. '■■-■:-. The proprietors of . the gas works at Nineteenth avenue i south and' First street, against whom the residents in that vicinity have complained because their wells have been tainted by the gases, etc., have agreed to pay the ex pense of sinking wells for the citizens to a depth sufficient to escape auy per colation from the upper soil.

John Wright, D. D., read one of the most interesting aud schol arly papers ever giveii to any clerical gathering in the city, lt was on Greek testaments, and showed a world of labor and knowledge. It was a great surprise to many of the clergy co hear that in the sixteenth century more editions of the Bible were printed in Italy than in England. A very warm tribute was paid to the German scholar ship, as being in the lead in knowledge in many cases, It is well that in Biblical knowledge men of different times, races and views have taken part. Revs.Fortin, Alexander and others spoke upon the paper. It was the de sire of the meeting that tho paper be published. There never was a more profitable clericus held by the breth ren. ALMOST A COLLISION. Narrow Escape While Going to Last Night's Fire. The fire department was called out at 9:30 o'clock last night by the discovery of dense smoke issuing from the rear of the Metropolitan meat market, No. 905 Nicollet avenue. The place is conduct ed by F. Smith, and when the depart ment arrived it was difficult to effect an entrance. The smudge was finally squelched, although the smoke was thick enough to cut. A portion of the building is occupied by the Nicollet Carpet- Cleaning com pany, and if the fire had gained head way serious results would have fol lowed, as the structure "is built of flimsy material. The damage was trilling, and the origin is involved in mystery. On the way to the fire what nearly proved a horrible collision occurred at the corner of Third street and Nicollet, between a hook and ladder truck and one of the steamers. They were coin ing from, opposite directions and met just at the turn, the hook and ladder wheelman driving his truck into the oooooooooood ©A Clock out off W order shows it on the© (§j face.

Tnere was gathered a large and ap preciative audience at The First Bap tist church last evening to listen to the lecture given by Rev. Joseph Cooke, of Boston. In the course of Introductory remarks by Dr. Hoyt, he stated that there would? be a lecture given: this evening at the above church on the sub ject of ''Municipal Government," which, in view of recent events, will no doubt be of interest. About a quarter ofa century ago Jo seph Cooke flashed, meteor-lite, above the horizon and astonished and dazed I all Boston with his brilliancy, and ever since has he been a thorn in the side of the followers of Darwin, Tyndall, Stuart Mill and Spencer. Nor has he lost any of his mentality or his brill iancy, as was evinced last night in his lecture, the sublect of which was "The Christian Idea, of Evolution, or God In Natural Law." In the course of his remarks he said that. we are not to feel that nature and- God are interchangeable terms any more than light and raiubow are inter changeable terms. It was no part of his plan to reply to Drummcnd, who really holds the same view as he does. In the universe only two things exist —mind and matter. Matter may trans mit force, but cannot originate ft. . All force originates in will. Evolution is never a cause, but a process. Nothing made by man has its motive within itself. No effect can be greater than its cause. If a certain effect comes out a certain cause went in. You can't take out of a hat more than lias been put into it. Some things God does through the glove, natural law; some things he does by -the hand. Matter is inert, mind originates. Causation Is the will, crea tion the act of God. The lecture was brilliant throughout, and showed profound research and knowledge of the subject. A ROMANTIC MARRIAGE. Harry Patteo Elopes With a Charming Belle From Manistee. Harry Paltee, the son and heir of James 11. Pattee, the money loaner, re turned to the city yesterday morning, and much to the surprise of his parents and friends he was not alone. On the contrary he was accompanied by a young and blushing bride who was -introduced into his sec for the first time, and who was received with more or less demon strations of affection. It appears that Pattee fiis has been a traveling salesman for the Faribault Shoe company, and that he took advantage of his Thanksgiving vacation to enter into the blissful state of matrimony. . The bride was a Miss Bertha May Hoyt, the daughter of A. Z. Hoyt, a well-known business man of Manistee, Mich., and the ceremony oc curred at Windsor, Ont.. last Wednes day. According to a preconcerted plan the young lady met her husband that, was to be upon the arrival of the train from the north at sa. m. on the day named, having taken her effects from the parental rooftree clandestinely the night before. From Manistee they went to Detroit, and from thence to Windsor, which is across the river from that city, the cere mony being persormed by Rev. A. J. Vining, a Baptist preacher. Tne parents of the couple on both sides were kept in ignorance of what was going on. and not until yesterday was the father of the groom apprised of the fact that he had a young and hand some daughter-in-law. Like the con ventional papa in the romantic plays, it is said he was fain to tear his hair, meta phorically speaking, of course, but that lie afterwards relented, and all that is now wanting to complete their cup of bliss is the parental blessing. ANOTHER UNION FORMED. Minneapolis Railway Employes Join the American Railway Union. The second union of the American Railway union in Minneapolis was or ganized at Harmonia hall last evening. Officers were elected and all the conditions of the union agreed to. The organization was the result of a rattling speech by G. W. Howard, of Chicago.the vice president of the Amer ican Railway union. He explained to the men the causes and the aims of the union, and pointed out what he declared to be its advantages over the Brother hood of Locomotive Engineers and otherunionsof railway .men. which form a federation, not a unified body or com pact organization, with one constitu tion, etc. After the meeting broke up about fifty of the railroad men, representing all the terminal lines and all classes of employes, from trackman to engineer, remained and effected an organization, of which the following were elected officers: President, A. S. Young; vice presi dent, Thomas Scanlan; secretary, J. HJ Blumenauer. . 

RECEIVER TO BE ASKED FOR. The Creditors of A. E. Horton Hold a Protracted Meetijig. The creditors of A. E. Horton, the Washington avenue furniture dealer, held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the office of Rea, Hubachek & Healy, who are the attorneys for most of them. What was decided on at the meeting was not given out. but it was rumored that some of .the Irate creditors wanted to have criminal proceedings brought against Mr. Horton, claiming that he sold his goods for -cash and put the money away, deliberately intending to defraud his creditors. Another class of people who are angry are some who bought and paid for goods at the sale last week,|and whichjwere not delivered before the sheriff swooped down on the store. The creditors filed an applica tion for a receiver in the district court yesterday afternoon. Mr. Horton said yesterday that he would make an as signment today.but had not yet decided whom he would name as assignee. His attorney is ex-County Attorney Thian, who was busy all day preparing papers for the assignment. Mr. Horton be lieves he will be able to resume ousi ness after everything Is straightened out, and says all goods sold that were still in the store when the sheriff took charge will be delivered by the assignee* The County Makes $1,500. At the meeting of the county com missioners yesterday it was reported that the expenses of the county due to the extra criminal work of November amounted to over $1,500. The county commissioners authorized the county attorney to employ additional legal help when necessary, the expense not to ex ceed $150 a month. This was the re sult of a recommendation by the grand jury. Light for the Seventh "Ward. The council gas committee will rec ommend that electric lights be placed at Seventeenth avenue south and Thirty fourth street and at Tenth avenue south and Twenty-fifth street. This is in re sponse to numerous requests from the Seventh warders, who claim that as the gas mains do not run to these points they are without light, and in danger of being held up. The New Engine House. Eighteen aldermen visited? the new Oak street fire engine house yesterday, and inspected it . from top to bottom. They came away well satisfied.

An Extremely Interesting Session or.- the Park Board Yesterday "» Afternoon — Mr. Loring's Ke "' port Is Read, and It * Proves, an Instructive and Able Doc ument—The River Boulevard. The most interesting meeting of' th c park board for many a month was held yesterday afternoon, It was interesting, because it developed a surprise." Presi dent C. M. Loring resigned from '-.the. board.? Not a member of the board, so far as is known, expected the resigna tion. After all the routine business of the meeting . had been ' disposed ' of, President Loring arose and read his,, annual report, which is always prepared.-; at this time in order to enable the secre tary to incorporate in the annual report of the park : board. At the conclusion ot the report Mr. Loring said: "Gentlemen, it Is with sincere regret that I have to announce to you my in tention of severing my connection with this board. Circumstances have placed; me in a position in which my action asa park commissioner might be construed as favoring my personal interests. Words cannot express how keenly I feel the necessity for this action, "which takes me away from the work in which 1 take so much pride and pleasure. But 1 shall not lose my interest in your work, and I shall watch its development with as much pride as if I were one ot the workers. 1 wish to express to you my thanks for the kindness and courte sies you have ever extended to me, and tho assurance that I shall always ta„e the warmest interest in your personal welfare, as well as yo ur public work.' President Loring had scarcely taken " his seat bafore Commissioner Rand moved that 25,000 copies of the presi dent's report be printed, and that 20,000 copies ba placed with the superintend ent of schools for distribution among the pupils. The motion was carried unanimously. Then the board ad journed. President Loring's report was in structive and interesting. It was ad mirably prepared and full of valuable information and sound suggestions. It impressed the members of the board as the work of a man who has made parks a life study and founded his knowledge of them upon extensive observation at home aud abroad. Mr. Loring's report reviewed the his tory of the Minneapolis parks, and told what improvement the park board has made during the past year. It also con tained some valuable recommendations, the most important of which was that the park board should" se cure the west bank of the Missis sippi river to Minnehaha falls for boulevard purposes and ' obtain a government grant of the river bank from the falls to Fort Snelling. The board should then exert its influence to induce St. Paul to acquire the river banks up to Fort Snelling, and tints the two cities would possess a match less driveway. Mr. Loring dwelt this connection upon, the necessity of a city in its younger days providing, itself with breathing places. <■ J ..;: "Cities, as well as animals.must have'; ungs. By securing the banks of bur . lakes, river, and Minnehaha creek we are building up lungs and bronchial tubes for supplying pure blood to our children." Your duty is not f done until you secure the west bank of the river and induce St. Paul to do the same.'* -In answer to the argument that the river banks are needed by manufactur ing and commercial purposes, Mr* Lor ing said that this question could be : set tled when the demand came, and that the park board would not . stand in the way of business institutions, or drive them away by exorbitant demands. Mr. Loring congratulated the park board for its economy, ' and furnished some interesting comparisons with other cities - in the matter ? ; of the proportionate cost of parks. Mr. Loring said that Minneapolis had secured a greater area of parks for a" much smaller amount of money than any other city. He cited statistics showing that Boston's ten parks, num bering 1,838 acres, had cost her $10, --359,502, while Minneapolis had paid for forty-three parks', with 1,664 acres, only $2,250,555. Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis all suffered by comparison. The reason for this was to be found in the generosity of the citi zens of Minneapolis, who have donated land and money and otherwise assisted the park board in acquiring lands cheaply. To these citizens Mr. Loring paid a high compliment. He also spoke of the time 30 years ago when a town meeting was held with a view to obtaining some land tor a park in the vicinity of Grant street. "There were present at that meeting besides myself." said Mr. Loring, "Col. W. S. King, Dorilus Morrison, George A. Brackett and two other gen tlemen. These last two opposed the purchase of the land, claim ing that it would not be needed, as the town was all park, and would prob ably never get as far up as Tenth

Lake Calhoun should be included in the park system, and the canal between it and the Lake of the Isles should be enlarged to admit of the passage of boats. -Mr. I Loring spoke in enthusiastic language of the Minnehaha parkway from Lyn | dale aveuue to Minnehaha falls, and [recommended that the: board secure the banks of Lake Amelia and make the lake a reservoir for the falls In times of drought. Columbia park, Powderhorn i lake. Lake of the Isles, Spring lake and j Lyndale park were all briefly touched .upon and further improvements recom mended. Referring to winter sports, Mr. Loring said: i ' "The board should encourage the use of the lakes in parks for skating and | other sports. The sight of the children j leaving the schools and hurrying to the skating pond sfter- several hours' con finement in rooms in which tho air has j become vitiated, and their bright, fresh, ) happy faces when enjoying the exhilor ating exercises on the ice, is one that [should stimulate our citizens to liberal appropriations for the . maintenance of the parks." The only other matter of Interest be fore the board Was the debate over the East river bank boulevard. The spe cial committee reported iv favor of issuing $20,000 worth of bonds to wards paying for the improvement, and Com missioner Foi well, of the committee, supported the recommendation. Prof. well said that his constituents on the East side wanted the driveway. :*?"? Mayor Enstis was opposed to the is suing of any more bonds at present, and made a calamity speech, in which he said that it would make him blush from head to foot to sign any such reso lution. Commissioner Ryan also ob jected, as usual, in behalf of the tax payers, but the board adopted the report by a vote of 9 to 4, the other two nega tive votes being those of Commissioners Rand and Dahu. The matter of furnishing skating privileges was referred to tlie committee on whiter sports, the superintendent of parks and the president of the board, with power to act.

SENATOR HALE — The message is made up of details. As to Hawaii, he leaves that to the fut ure. We expected him to favor the Wil son bill, and the Republicans are op posed to it. Senator Lodge— The most, ot the message was taken up with . perfectly harmless routine business. The clause about Hawaii appears to , announce the extraordinary doctrine that it is our duty. to overturn a government we have recognized in order to recognize an other government. On this theory we ought to instantly restore Texas and Mexico; and France,: which .'entered into an alliance with us during the Revolution, ought now to restore us, by force if necessary, to England. The statement in regard to the' tariff con tains one very interesting clause. This morning it was understood that Demo cratic members of the ways and means committee had not yet agreed as to the new taxes to raise ; internal revenue, but the president states in bis message what those new taxes are to be. It has always heretofore been believed that under the constitution the right to inaugurate money mills rested with the house of representatives. By this message it appears that now taxes are to be first determined by the president, who communicates them to congress, where there is nothing to be done ex cept to adopt them. The recommenda tions in regard to the civil service com mission and the increase of clerks for that service are in every way excel lent. f-ZZZ 

SENATOR POWER— I understand that the message was printed in London this morning. It should have been giveu out there yester day.so our British neighbors could have had more time lo tell us what to do about it. f i-z: : Senator Hawley— The message lacks vigor, and is a disappointment. The president's talk about tariff is common place in the extreme, and his remarks concerning the work of the ways and means committee are not justified by any information the country has. There has been no full meeting of the commit tee to censider some of these ques tions. Senator Dubois— is lacking in force, strength and Americanism, and must prove a great disappointment to the country. Concerning his recom mendation about bonds and the internal revenue monetary commission, I can only say that it looks decidedly as if the president thinks he can deal with the financial affairs of the country better than congress and the people. His statement of the Hawaiian question will be generally and justly criticised, and cannot be defended. Senator Jones, of Nevada The mes sage contains no suggestions or recom mendations which hold out any hope I for silver while the present administra tion is in power. .- 

SENATOR CAREY — The message is a disappointment. I ■ had hoped for some definite information i concerning Hawaii, and had supposed that the financial policy ot the adminis tration would be outlined. Senator Piatt— lt scarcely deserves comment. Senator Hansbrough— lt Is very weak and lame. Doubtless the message would have contained more life if it had been written after Van Alen had declined the mission to Rome. - Senator Shoup — I was disappointed to ascertain that the president had. not made any recommendation for the rec ognition of silver. Senator Dixon— lt was a very weari some message, and without any sugges tions as to the immediate interests of the country. Wo had a right to expect something concerning the currency, in wincn the message fails. His brief'sinr gestion concerning the" tariff contains nothing new. A number of other senators, of whom were Democrats, were seen by the Associated Press representative, but declined to express their views. Among these were Sherman, of Ohio; Aldrich, of Rhode Island; Hill, of New York; Daniel, of Virginia; Mills, of Texas; Coke, of Texas; Jones, of Ar kansas; Cockrell, of Missouri; Smith, of Mew Jersey; Harris, of Teuuessee, and Walthall, of Mississippi.

The total cash receipts from various sources for the year amounted to 84,479,734.14. The re port says: It is a mistake to suppose that the number of Indians is rapidly decreasing.
