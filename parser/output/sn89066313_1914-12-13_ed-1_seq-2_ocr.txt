TUMBLING CLASS FOB GIELS Miss Hate Have you the real Christmas Alice Arnold TTHI Charge of Instruction. Miss Alice Arnold, assistant gym nasium instructor, will have a tumbling class for University wom en. One girl said, "They have had me in a special "gym" class said I wasn't strong enough to take the regular work. Well, when I heard that there was to be a tumbling class, I'm so crazy about swimming, (and I knew tumbling would help me to be a better diver this coming summer) that I went right over to the doctor to get permission not only to take the regular work, but to take tumbling. Maybe you think I wasn t happy when he said "Yes 'pretty sure" you will get a pres- mentioned the problem of rural r credit as one of the pressing prob lems of the day. He said, however, V that it had not been possible for a suitable 1)111 to be framed for con sideration by this session of Con gress. , The need for reform in our pres ent system of farm credit is great. The average farmer in the United States owns his farm more or less encumbered. Agriculture in this country has no greater handicap than our system of short-time farm mortgages. ' In the thirteen years from 1900 to 1913 our food imports increased J175.000.000. During the same pe riod our exports of food decreased $44,000,000. Agricultural products formed $84.3 per cent of our total exports in 1880; in 1913 they were only 46.1 percent of the whole. Dur ing the same period manufactured products showed an increase from 14.7 per cent In 1880 to 48.8 per cent in 1913. Food supplies were 55.77 per cent of our total exports in 1880; 'thirty-three years later the proportion of food exports had fallen to 20.72 per cent Colonel F. D. Gardner of. St Louis has pointed out that along with this decrease of the propor tlon of agricultural production to '.he' total of the country's produc Jon had come a rise of 70.9 per :ent in the retail price of food for the .last ten-year period. He made the assertion that if our cities con- Unued to grow at the expense of o'uj rural districts it would not be long before we ceased to export foo'd and began to go hungry at home. Admitting that the most prosper rts nation and the strongest nation financially is the one that is capa ble of feeding others as well as its own people, it will be seen by these figures that the United States is fast drifting away from prosperity. Unless something is done soon to give a great impetus to farming in this country, we shall become one of the nations that must depend on' other peoples to feed its popu lation. The short-time mortgages that a great part of American farmers must labor under are one of the chief causes of the relative decline of agriculture. In other countries farm credits are long-time credits A system of long-time farm mort gages in this country would go a 'ent? COLUMBIA'S ELECTRICITY. In regard to the present electric light and power situation in Co lumbia, where the municipally owned plant Is not used to any ex tent in the day-time, the following facts have been discovered. The proposed cut in the rate for day current would increase the de-j i mand. This from a prominent elec trical engineer of the city. A municipal electrical supply store, selling day power devices at close to cost, would increase the demand. This from a former resi dent of Hannibal, where the plan is being used with great success. A combination of the cut in rates and an electrical supply store would greatly increase the day de mand. This from Columbia's best- known efficiency engineer. The city is considering both plans. This from the chairman of the water and light committee of the City Council. In several Colorado cities the day rates are just a third of the night rates. This from a dean of the University faculty. The local plant is in a condition for the day'rates to be cut in half, providing the demand be increased sufficiently. This from the superin tendent of the water and light de partment And finally, Columbia can sell day current profitably at 3 cents a One Good Story . . naner sheet before he trnns to his . cnlrlt ni- linio mil n NO nf finlr I ,, ...i, j ., OWn An(j so talking the friends! you are strong enough now I'll those persons from whom you are , turned Into their chambers, as the notify them to let you take the dawn was beginning to peep.

At 4:30 special steel cars for the students of the college will leave over the Wabash for St Louis and Kansas City. Several of the railroads out of St Louis and Kansas City have agreed to hold their fast trains for the "Stephens' Special" so that ! connections can be made and no time will be lost in getting home. Those who do not leate Thursday afternoon will go Friday morning. These arrangements were made so that University students might have the trains Friday afternoon and Sat urday.

Such a system would enable the poorer farmers to gradually pay for their farms and hold them unincumbered. The farmer's financial burden is heavier today than he can bear and prosper under.

The Ameri- 1 can farmer should have the same advantages as the American busi ness man under any conditions.

HOLLAND'S OPEN ABMS. electric light and power plant. Pre sumably they are Interested In it Yet its proffered current is being allowed to go almost altogether to waste during the day-time. This is inefficiency. Yet its day rates are higher than they ought to be, preventing any appreciable use of the day current This is bad policy. Yet its Inability to sell electrical supplies keeps away the last hope of Increasing the day demand. This is short-sightedness. "Give me the demand." says the water and light superintendent, "and 111 cut the day rates In half." Waiving the possibilities that they could be cut two-thirds or three fourths, this is a liberal offer. Cut the rates, sell the supplies and you'll get the demand such is the answer of the citizens. This looks like a deadlock, with one side or the other having to yield In order to start the ball roll ing. But the citizens are both sides; they own the plant and they use the product of the plant, the elec tric current Why can't the citizens of Colum bia get what they want as proprie tors and as customers? No reason at all. It's merely a matter of let ting the wants be known. students entered.
