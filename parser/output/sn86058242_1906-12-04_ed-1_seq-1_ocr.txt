JAPANESE JS CITIZENS Touches on Negro Question and Sug gests on Currency Reform and the Trust Regulation. (Special to Lake County Times). Washington, Dec. 3. President Roosevelt's message to the second ses sion of the Fifty-ninth congress deals with a number of new and important subjects, chief of which is the govern ment prosecution of the trusts, the abuse of injunctions in labor troubles, the negro question, the preaching of class hatred between capital and labor, additional legislation for the control of large eorportalons, a federal inher itance and income tax law and cur rency reform. Tho message opens with a statement of what the last congress left unfin ished, and of this he says: "I again recommend a law prohibit ing all corporations from , contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a bill has already past one house of congress. Let individuals contrib ute as they desire; but let is prohibit In effective fashion all corporations from making contributions for any po litical purpose, directly or indirectly. "Another bill which has just past one house of congress and which is urgent ly necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon the government tne right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; it exists in the Dis trict of Columbia by act of the con gress. It is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for tho de fendant on the merits, should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had indicted certain persons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained tho defendant's demurrer; while in another Jurisdiction an Indictment for conspi racy to obtain rebates has been sus tained by the court, convictions ob tained under it, and two defendants sentenced to Imprisonment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it is un fortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At present there Is no way by which the government can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of Justice are blocked without any real decision of tho question. I cannot too strongly urge the passage of the bill in ques tion. A failure to pass will result in seriously hampering the goverrment in Us fffort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy individuals or corpora tions who do wrong; and may also pre vent the government from obtaining Justice for wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an in ferior court has been against them. I have specifically in view a recent de cision by a district judge leaving rail way employees without remedy for vio lation of a certain so-called labor statute. It seems an absurdity to per mit a single district judge, against what may be tho judgment of the im mense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional," and then deny to the gov ernment the right to have the supreme court definitely decide the question." ICvavlon by TecbulealltlCM. "In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our criminal law, resulting in large part from the habit of setting aside the judgments of inferior courts on technicalities ab solutely unconnected with the merits of tho case, and where there is no at tempt to show that there has been any failure of substantial justice. It would be well to enact a law providing some thing to the effect that: "No Judgment shall bo set aside or new trial granted in any cause, civil or criminal, on tho grounds of mis direction of the Jury or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for errors as to any matter of pleading or procedure unless, in the opinion of tho court to which the application Is made, after an examination of the en tire cause, it shall affirmatively appear that the error complained of has re sulted in a miscarriage of justice." Injunctions. On the subject of the abolition of Injunctions in labor disputes, he says: 'J my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of applying1 injunctions in lobor cases should be wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions in Buch cases would stand the test of the courts; in which case of course, the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong t altogether to prohibit the use of in-. Junctions, it is criminal to permit (Continued on page six.) OLD

WILL GIVE DICKENS IMPERSONATION. William Battls Sterling will next Thursday evening in the number that is to be given arpear second in the Hammond lecture course. Battis is an impersonator of the works of Dickens and by many is con sidered to be one of the best in his line now appearing before the public. In these "Life Portrayals" Battis re produces some of the more widely known creations of the great novelists with all their . peculiarities of speech and dress, with an appropriate mono logue arranged from the book la which the character appears. DIES If! OBSERVATIONS OF ARTIE. They not n great Joke on the police department. Some feller told one of the cops that a wo man Jumped off the Monon bridge and moaned "In here" when she Jumped. He said her faithful dog bad been drowned trying; to save bis mistress. Charley See said he didn't be lieve It, cause the water In front of the old slaughter-house nut so thick that the lady could wnlk on It If she fell In. Enny how the police drug the river nil day and all they could And was another dog like the first. Then one of the cops got a bright Idea and after putting finger to his forehead and bury ing himself In thought for a while, he said he bet the woman went down Just to drown those dogs. Of course he may be wrong and a woman may have drownod If she did Its a pity, but I sometimes think the world would be better off If they'd save some of the good dogs and drown a few of the bad people. And the weather, Artief o Increasing cloudiness and warmer tonight. Wednesday rnln followed by colder weather Wednesday night. "WHITING STILL "KICKING Prominent men of Whiting, who will allow their names to be used in con nection with the matter if necessary, are of the opinion that the public should know once and for all time that Whiting has no intention what ever of annexing its self to Hammond. The proposition is a ridiculous one, ac cording to popular sentiment, from 4 every standpoint. hltlng Sua """ PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT. GANINE HOMANCE TUr. PAIII EI MIL UHLUI1 Dragnet Brings Two Dogs to the Surface of the Murky Stream. NO SUICIDE IN THE AFFAIR Startling Cry Proves To Be Woman's Wail Over the Doomed Pet Terrier. A second dog scooped from the bot tom of the Calumet river yesterday afternoon by the police after a hard day's work in dragging the river for the body of a supposedly drowned woman, who was thought to have com mitted suicide by jumping from the Monon railroad bridge last Sunday evening, gave a plausible solution of the mystery that has been stirring Hammond for the past forty-eight hours. Investigation now centers on the person who committed the "dog gone murder." and the possibilities are that he has been hiding in Hammond some where yesterday and enjoying the ex citement that he has created. As Mr. Watklns is hired by the Erie Railroad company to guard the bridge and give warning to approaching trains, it cannot be expected of him that he be a professional in things peTtaining to suicide matters. But he may TBtill Toe correct when ne says mat lie neara a woman s cry last Sunday evening which ended with tne words, "in here. The woman may have taken the little fox terrier in her arms and cried over him like one would over somebody that is dear to one and when she thought she had cried enough over him, she may have wound up her wail with the words "in here," as she tossed him into the Calu met. Mr. Watkins says that for a time he heard no more, which, by applying the Sherlock Holmes principle, is also very plausible, as the dog was too surprised when he first struck the dirty waters of the Calumet river to make another sound for a time. As for the woman she evidently walked away in order not to be a witness to the "crime that she had committed. She could not have gone very far when the dog began to bark. He barked for two reasons. First of all he wanted to get out of the Calumet river as it, in that particular place is very, very dirty, the slaughter house having for years emptied its filth into this very spot. He couldn't sink very easily as the water was too thick and occasionally he found a place where he could walk on the water, but soon he would again be stuck, While he was struggling hard to follow his cruel 'mistress she drew farther away from him and his bark became more desperate, until, in hi3 exhaustion, it finally died down and the dog in his hopelessness, gulp ed down several mouthfuls of th Calumet water, closed his eyes and resigned himself to the inevitable. He was after all a lucky dog. His body was found soon after his death. The fate of the one that was found late yesterday afternoon, and which evidently was drowned some time ago, was probably just as cruel as that of his brother.
