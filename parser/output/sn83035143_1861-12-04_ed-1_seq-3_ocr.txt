From Edgarton's Battery and the 41st Regiment. CAMP JENKINS, Ky., Nov. 28, '61. 00 00 00 Eds. LkADka We arrived lost night at the wharf at Louisville. Remained on board during the night, and debarked early this morning, and atSo'olock theoolumn moved forward through the streets of the oity in tke following order : Leland's magnificent band led (he way, playing one of those grand quioVwtep to which the people of the Forest ty heve often Intoned with delight ; than followed the ilai, while the Artillery brought up the rearV Notwithstanding the rain, the t1T u riagnifloent leceptlon. During the whole line) 4f ot" march the (oldier'i heart was oheered bj demonstration of wel come. Union flax h.nng from nearly every building, and front the window of all the dwelling beamed te (Mile of the patriotic ladietof LouitTille. Old aad young, white and black, hurrahed for the Union, and oherred ut on our way, and many timet wat the benediction, "Ood bleat you," pronoun ced .upon us. After marching a mile, we arrived at the splendid and oapaciou depot of the Louisville A Nashville Railroad. This we entered, glad to get shelter from a rathtr vigorous rain. Here we were to receive our Thanksgivi Qg dinner and a fine dinner for soldier it wie. Our total bill of fare con sisted of goo.1 fresh bread, good ham and good coffee. .Every soldier's face looked happy. A soldfer's life is calculated to make oae relish good "victuals ) and if we ever ate real Thanksgiving dinner, it was in the Louisville depot. Many of ns would have been glad to join, the yearly family gather ing in the old hettse at home, but we felt that we were in Use path of duty, and are ocsntenL , After dinner we marched to this camp, about five mile frotn the city, where we ar rived about one o'clock, but wiUhout cooking ubinsils and tentleaa. The baggage of the Battery waa with tbatt of tht 41st, and as we are separated from the reginnnt la o&mp, we are at thitwriting (7 o'clock:) still in the open air. I am sitting on ny knapsack writing upon part ot a barrel-htwd for a ta ble; a camp fire furnishes light Sot me, and m a consequence the lice on the paper era not very well defined. But at a sol dier must learn to look on the bright aide of things, and make the best of everything, tb vrill be a good lesson for me. For our supper thie evening we made- out finely. We had seme of Jenkin' corn ground at Gallipolis, and brought the meal with n. We borrowed some kettle from Capt. Kon kle, made aome mush, and ate it without condiments, on a chip, with a wooden kaife. We enjoyed it well. Oar trip to Gallipol was not productive of any very brilliant remit. Seven thousand bushel of corn, ten horse and one hun dred and fifty hog were confiscated, also two p risen ers were taken, with $40 confede rate scrip. No one waa killed, and no one made himself distinguished by acta cf valor. Tb Galliitoli Journal call n the "blood- let 41st." We left Oallipolia on Tueeday morning en board tbe splendid s trainer Telegraph. Tbe boy turned the palatial cabin into a cook room, and three time a day the orapr of army bacon would have been perceptible to the moetconfirmed muff taker And at night the long rows of sol diert lying rapt In slumber on the floor most have presented a strange scene tor this cabin. Our voyage down the riTer was one of interesting incidenia. W arrived at Cincinnati the tame evening we left Oalli polia, when we remained until Wednesday Boon. At 11 M. we left In company with the Major Anderson, the Tegular mall boat. We had an exciting race for SO mile, when we patted the Anderson and sped ewiftly down the riTer alone. Tne aoenery at thi time ot tb year i ranch more interesting below then above fflnoinnati, and had not been very ehilly our trip would haT been enjoyed hugely. Thit morning when we " turned out" we were turpi ieed to find two boat from the Kanawha, along aide, having on board the 34th Ohio, from Cheat Mountain. Aa the campaign hi over in Western Virginia, ssv ral regimenal have aome, mad mar ars coming from tbat section to engage in a winter oampeixn In Tennessee. The boys look hale and hearty and will do good ser vice in dispersing the rebel army at Bow ling Greed Can. Nelson's Brigade from Kaalera Ken tucky I now here, and a more exbtusted tnd worn out set of men I never saw. ' They have done more marohing over worse roads, and been more poorly clothed and fed than any other brigade In theservioe. Six weeks ago CaU Konkle left Camp Dennison with 156 good healthy men. Now after that rough rough march there ar aot 50 men fit for duty in hi battery. The Id Ohio went through that campaign without overcoat, and at a consequence many of the men are now sick with cold which will unfit them for service always, but costly as this campaign was for us, it was more to for the rebett. Prisoner ttatt tbat of tome fulloompanie not twenty were fit for duty at the fight at Piketown. - There it a very large force being collect ed here, and if desirable I will writ yon J. S.

Wood Laid Out in the Cold. ANOTHER VICTORY IN MISSOURI. Last Night's Report. CONGRESSIONAL. HOUSE. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Mr. May nurd presented the credentials of Mr. Clemens, Representative elect from the 4th distriot of Tennessee. He briefly related the eircumstanoe under which the election was held, saying that three mem bers were elected in East Tennessee men who declare for the National Constitution and for the flag under which they bad lived and under which they had honed to die. . On motion, the credentials were referred to the Commitleo on Eleotiona. On motion of Washburne, tbe President's Message was referred to the Committee of the Whole on tbe state of the Union, and hia motion for printing 60,000 extra copies waa referred to ine committee on Printing. Mr. Dunn offered tbe following: Whereas, Henry O. Burnett, a' member of this House from Kentucky, is in open reoeuion against the Uovernment of the United States; therefore, Resolved, That the said Henry C. Bur nett be and he is hereby expelled from this House, and that tbe Governor of Kenluoky be notified of his expulsion. Resolved, That the 8ergeant-at Arms be instructed not to pay Burnett's salary which has accrued since the close of the extra session. Mr. WiekliSe said he had intended to prepare and submit a proposition some thing like an obituary notioe of his col league. Laughter The latter was not only, as the resolution asserted, in armed rebellion, but head a Provisional Govern ment in Kentuoky and a revolutionary convention. Not satisfied with the treat ment of this Government to maintain the Union, nor satisfied with the course of hia own State, he (Burnett) assumed the im. portent duty ol organizing another Govern ment for the better protection of the lives, property and liberty of the people of Ken tucky, and in thin undertaking emoloved Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat assimilated in name, but in deeds, to Si mon Girty, who once headed the Indians In Kentucky. Three times haa the gallant 8tat of Kentucky declared by overwhelm ing majorities the would not leave the United states to run after strange gods, or for the so-called Southern Republic Not withstanding her repeated declarations for the Union ; in violation of tbe well known sentiments of the people of Kentucky, they had been told the object of the Convention and of tit so-called Southern Confederacy was to relieve them from despotism and to protect their rights, and we are deceived. We were told by the Executive of this so oalled Southern Confederacy that it was intended to respeot the condition of Ken tucky, which it was protended would not be dene by the Government of, the United States. The Union men of Kentucky never did deny the right of the Federal Govern ment to oooupy its soil for the exercise of the purposes Implied by the Constitution. Kentucky did acknowledge her okligatious and expressed her intention to fulhl them. The proclamation of the Governor of Ken tucky deceived the people, but the Legisla ture denounced it. Two messengers of peace were sent to tbe Jsxeoutive of the United Slates, and one to the President of the Southern Government, to know what was intended to be done with Kentucky. The former said it was intended to main tain the lass and Constitution of the United States, and that this was believed to be the will of the people of Kentucky. The latter declared he intended to respect the neutrality of Kentucky as understood by the secession party of that State ; but the tiputhern President did not tell them be had matured a plan to assail tbeui at toe different points ; nor did he tell them there was on the statute books of the Southern govern ment a law providing money and means, not to sustain Kentucky against oppression, but to carry her Into the Soutliern Comederacy, against the majority of two-thirds of the en tire State. The Provisional Governor of Kentucky waa sent to see the government at Richmond, meanwhile Burnett is at the head of tbe new order of affairs in the dis charge of bis duty, and an armed force has been gathered, corn posed o) young, desperate men, commanded by Buckner. In conclusion Mr. W. aud; With the bless ing of God I predict that by the 25th of December no rebel foot will be found on the soil of Kentucky. (Applause) Tbe resolution for the expulsion of finr- dttt was adopted. 

SENATE. The President's Message and accompany ing documents were ordered printed. Mr. tinmes ottered a bill tendeiing the thank ot Congress to Com. Dupont and those under his command for the recent vic tory at Port Royal. Laid aside till the for mation of the Standing Committees. On motion of Mr. Foster it was resolved that the Vice President appoint two mem bers to 6U the vacancies in the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institute, caused by the death oi Senator Douglas and the expulsion ot James Si. Mason. ,
