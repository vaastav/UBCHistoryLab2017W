DEMANDS REWARDS BE EQUAL General Breckinridge Feels the Army Is Slighted for the Navy. Washington. Dec 4 The report of Gener al J. C. Breckinridge, Inspector General of the Army, earnestly recommends that the benefits of the law of March 3. 1SW, pro viding for the retirement of officers of the navy, under certain condition", with the rank and pay of the nett higher grade, lie extended to Include officers of the nrrr. "Most of our wars have been fought on land," saS the report, "and as a matter of simple justice rewards for army oplcers should bo no less extensive than those en joyed by officers of the naval branch." Ho also touches upon the disulvantagcs. Imposed on Inferior rank In the arm, cit ing as an instance the China campaign, when General Chaffee, a junior among the International commanders, was advanced from a Brigadier to a Major General to give him the rank requisite to his status a commander In chief of the United States forces In China. General Breckinridge also rotices that the grade of Brigadier General Is abolished in most of the Kuropean armies, and Is near ly as archaic as the rank of Commodore afloat. In regard to the question or organizing tho starting aimy, the General suggests a standard of two soldier per every 1.W0 or population, and submits statistics to flhow that in the proportion or soldiers to population and totbe area of the country and in the war budget In time of peace, the United States Is far behind all or the great European nations. General Breckinridge claims for his de partment the credit of the discovery of the postal frauds In Cuba. lie makes recommendation for additional clerical and messenger assistance In hl9 department, and also earnestly suggests that the War Department provide the various military colleges throughout the country with capa ble and cfflcleat military instructors. c .1.1 . r.p i- a luIs for -nidi a project. tli rh would not ho xjs : sio " it th-s puint pn te fs w. re r li-vd. and M r.illnrii 1sk.1l Umeral Mprihr i.ot to cu lt r him the 1! tails of the ilnnic Cui.ril 'Miriiir npli'il tl at the s'lmiK" could In lull1 oer tlie hial of Ih-Rlmd like , the sword of Iu-uolIis ami he propostu a risilutinii tl it the sm nate should 1 ilte the iornniont to ecn.plete in nvdi itt K 1 titrations fir the muhllizatli.u of the arm and na In pripariiifj nmihiiw nuifs.ir to iinb-irk and di-imhirk as np 1P v p issilii, an .

Tage blatt and Nitlonnl Zeltung. refrain from comment on President McKlnlej's message. Other papers speak of the cold, even threatening. language it Is -iia to contain In regard to Germ my. The VcssiSChe .Ceitung sas: "It is noticeable that President McKinley refers, ver coolly to America's rel itlons with Germany. As In lmuortant state docu ment of tlds kind every word Is care full wiighed beforehand. It is undoubt edly significant that President Mc Kinley should describe the relations with France and England as friendly, whereas, "peaking of relations with Germany, he merely remarks that the show "evidenco of good will.' Such a distinction cannot but be Intended, and Is all the more surprising in view of the very frl-ndly speech to Ger many delivered by Ambassador White at the Thanksgiving dinner ot the American colony."

XIEVW PRESS SiVRCVSTIC. SPECIAL BV CABLE. Vienna. Dec. 4 (Cop right, 1, by tha New York Herald Company.) President Mc Kinle'si message does not meet with a xcry rriendly reception In the Austrian rrcss. It Is considered lac! lag In the diplomatic retro spect which is usuall a feature of docu ments or this nature which are intended for world-wide consumption. The Neues Wiener Tageblatt remarks with irony: "Imren ilhn in deed has developed now In to Imperialism in word. It Is easy to satisfy Americans with the one bolltary restriction, in regard to China." The Neue Freie Presse sas: "The message gives the impression that there Is a much better understanding be tween the United States. Russia and Japan than there Is between these three and tha other Powers." The Presse finds it surprising that Presi dent McKinley should speak of America fceeking to confer the benefits of freedom up on the Filipinos, seeing that the Filipinos re fighting lor that freedom. i V -I liDvgss-:
