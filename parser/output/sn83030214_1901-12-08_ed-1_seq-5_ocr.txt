The recent controversy between Buildings Commissioner Wallace and a number of archi tects and builders has finally been taken into the courts. Incidentally, District Attorney Phil bin has promised to Investigate alleged miscon duct on the part of the Commissioner. On the application of Frank T. Noble, a tax payer, Justice Beach in the Supreme Court yesterday issued an order directing Commis sioner Wallace to appear before him and shovv cause why a peremptory writ of mandamus should not issue to compel him to carry out the provisions of Section 105 of the Building Code. The order 1b returnable on December 11. The order further directs Commissioner Wal lace to show cause why- action should not be taken to prevent further violations of the law in the construction of the building at the south east corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane. The petitioner further asks that the owners of the building in question be compelled to comply with the law. While Mr. Noble appears as the petitioner, he represents a large number of architects and builders who are dissatisfied with the manner in which things are conducted in the Buildings Department. In his petition for the writ Mr. Nobie says that he is interested in the outcome of the mat ter embraced in the petition. He then says that James G. Wallace, under the provisions of the "reater New- York charter, was duly appointed a commissioner of buildings with administra tive jurisdiction in the Boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx. Mr Noble cites Section I<>s of the Building Code, which provides that wh?n the height of a fireproof building exceeds twelve stories, or more than ISO feet, all outside window frames and sash shall be of metal or of wood covered with metal, and that the inside window frames and s;i«h doors, trim and other interior finish may be of wood, covered with metal, or of wood treated by some process approved by the Board of Buildings, to render the same fireproof. Mr. Noble asserts that this section has never been repealed, changed or amended, and is still in efiect and that the building at Broadway and Ma'den Lane is being constructed in absolute violation of its provisions. The petitioner as serts that Commissioner Wallace was properly informed of the alleged violations of the law, but that he has failed to act. —^-j Several days ago District Attorney Philbin wrote a letter to Commissioner Wallace, inform ing him that if the alleged violations were going on they should be stopp-d at once. In return Commissioner Wallace inclosed a report of an inspector in his department to the effect that no violations existed. Mr. Philbin is awaiting the report of an investigation he has set on foot, and if the evidence warrants it he will place the case before the grand jury. Commissioner Guilfoyle, of Brooklyn, declared that he had not voted in favor of the plans for th<» building in question, and an investigation of the record shows that he did not. Mayer- & Gilbert, attorneys for Mr. Noble, promise a sensation when the case comes up for argument. Mr. Mayer was formerly counsel for the Buildings Department. TERMIXAL BILL MAY BE VOID. ALLEGED CXCOXSTITUTIOXALITT OF THE STATUTE FOR IXCREASIXG FACILITIES AT THIS END OF THE BRIDGE. An alleged defect has been discovered in the McCarren bill authorizing the changing of the Manhattan terminal of the Brooklyn Bridge. On account of this the act is believed by the Board of Estimate to be unconstitutional. The State Constitution provides: "No private or- local bill which may be passed by the legislature shall embrace more than one subject, and that shall be expressed m the title." The bridge terminal bill apparently embraces two distinct features, nan.ely. one for the exten sion of the terminal facilities, the other for a franchise for the elevated roads, which may be limited to terminal facilities at the City Hall station or may go to Harlem over a new route. In view of the probable defect in the law, it is said that Controller Coier will advise that no action be taken in the Board of Estimate on the terminal plans. MOUXT TERXOX'S GIRL BURGLAR. BELIEVED TO BE THE LEADER OF A BAND OF FEMALE ROBBERS. Mary Elizabeth Thompson, the seventeen-year old girl burglar who is locked up In the Mount Ver non police station charged with a score of rob beries, the police believe is the leader of a gang of female burglars who are directed by a "feece" in this city. Yesterday detectives began an investi gation which they believe will unearth a "fence" in this city whore the burglars in skirts dispose of their plunder. Mary, who is a Creole and small for her ago, was arraigned before Judge Bennett and remanded for trial until to-morrow. She will be held fur the grand jury on the specific charge of looting the house of Mrs. Samuel Hettinger at Xew-Rochelle. All of the booty was found in her possession. Mary, who was traced by the imprints of her French heeled shoes, which were found around the house she plundered, said: "I didn't steal anything. The things were given to me." Among those who the police say have been robbed by Mary Thompson are the following: Mrs. Samuel Hettinger, Horton-ave., New-Rochelle; Clara Morris, the actress, of Yonkers: Dr. James Barry. No. 104 Chester-st.. Mount Vernon. $800 worth of silverware: D. I. Car?on. Pelham Manor. $500; E. T. Gilliland, ex-presidnt cf the village, Pelham Manor; parsonage of the Rev.

A little Arab boy. from Bethlehem of .ludea. has been found wandering destitute in the streets of Paris. He is only fifteen years of age. and has passed through some strange adventures in search of his father, who left Bethlehem to seek his fort une in Paris a long time ago, and has not since been heard of. The lad mapaged to get down to the coast and get engaged as cabin boy on' a ship bound for France. On landing he proceeded to beg his way to Paris, where he has been found by the i)oliee. sleeping and starving, on a seat on the Boulevard Menilmontant. This ycung Bethelhemite had no notion, cf course, what Paris was like. It bears no resemblance to Bethlehem, snd a father is not so easily found. The police are taking care of this homeless wanderer from the Holy Land. TO DISCUSS 'THE riTY BEAUTIFUL."

Bloomneld, N. J., Dec. 7.— Great excitement was caused by a dog which ran wildly through the business portion of the town this afternoon. The streets were crowded with women and children, and when the do? made its appearance they dodged Into doorways and other places of safety. The animal bit several other dogs, and then dashed at Frank Smith, an employe of the Lacka wanna Railroad, and bit him on the leg. Smith ran to a nearby druir store, where the wound was cauterized. Charles Green, a twelve-year-old boy, was next attacked by the dog, and was bitten on the hip. William H. Hall, a letter carrier, was next attacked, but escaped being bitten. He kicked the animal in the side, and sent it rolling into the gutter. Patrolman Charles Durning appeared at that moment and shot the animal five times be fore he killed it. The dog is believed to have been mad. JUDOE DUNNE DECLARES they WERE wot GUILTY OF CONTEMPT. Chicago. Dec. 7.— Andrew M. Lawrence, manag ing editor of "The Chicago American," and H. S. Canfield, of the staff of that paper, who were sen tenced recently by Judge Hanecy to forty and thirty days, respectively, in the county Jail for con tempt of court, wore discharged from custody by Judge Dunne to-day. In granting a writ of habeas corpus to the re lators the court said that the case hinged on whether the case on which "The Chicago Ameri can" commented had been disposed of by Judge Hanecy or was still pending. Judge. Dunne held that the case in question had been finally disposed of by Judge Hanecy when he gave his decision from the bench. The fact that the clerk had not entered the order when the com ment on the decision was printed and published, therefore, does not show that the case was Btill pending. The act of entering the order on the record was merely a ministerial act. Judge Dunne said. Judge Dunne, admitted that the articles and cartoon to which Judge Hanecy objected were clearly calculated to intimidate and coerce the court, had the court not already rendered its de cision. Judge Dunne admitted that the cartoon in evidence was probably libellous, and the articles possible so. Harsh criticism. Judge Dunne remarked, is one Of the incidents and burdens ot" public life. "I see , no reason," he said, "why a Judge should be of- . fered a different remedy for attacks in the public prints that a President, or a Governor, or a Con- j gressraan. Criticism of a public official, if just. r will do good: if unjust, will do harm." : In concluding, the court said: "I am clearly of the opinion that the language used in open court by Judge Hanecy amounted to a final order dispos ing of the case under consideration; and, that being a linal order, under the doetrino of 'contempt' as laid down in this State by our Supreme Court in the i case of Storey vs. the People, the relators had a right to comment on and criticise that decision, even to" the extent of libelling the honored and respected judge who rendered that opinion, without exposing themselves to prosecution for contempt of court. The following is Judge Hanecy's comment on Judge Dunne's decision: '■Judge Dunne had the power so to decide, but he did not have the right. Any judge has the power to let every prisoner out of the peniten tia.-ies but they have not the right, nor does any body expect that they will." The contempt case and the habeas corpus hearing which followed grew out of an effort made by '•The Chi'Mgo American" to secure an order for quo warranto proceedings to compel the People s Ga~, Light and Coke Camrany to show by what right they operated in Chicago. Judge Hanecy refused to allow the quo warranto proceeding, and. following this refusal, "The Amer ican" printed articles and a cartoon strongly inti mating "that the Judge had been unduly influenced, and that when he again came up for election ne would discover that the people had no confidence in him Judge Hanecy cited Lawrence and Can field with others of the paper, for contempt, and found Lawrence and Canfleld guiky.
