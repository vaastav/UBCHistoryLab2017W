AND TTC1 n1 The Woodstock Standard starts off well undor the new management and bid fair to improve on tbe enviable record it dim made in the past. If those of our exc-hungcs who dip their editorials would only take them from the right paper they might have the bent there are in the "World." See? One of the most noteworthy pieces of newspaper enterprise whs the poll of Con gress by the N. Y. Press on the silver question. It has shown that no radical free coinage bill can pass this Congress. Tammany's roan Turner, door-keeper of the House, has the disposal of 130,000 in salaries. No wonder Tammany finds it pays to go into national polities and sneeringly asks the people "What are you going to do about it?" When the Senate met, the great state of New York, with its six millions of inhabr Hants, had only one representative, be cause Governor-Senator David B. Hill was trying to help the democrats steal the Leg islature of that state. We acknowledge the receipt of the re port of the Governor of AlaBka. It con tains much valuable information con cerning this distant territory, its resourc es and people, but is notwithstanding, rather dry reading tor the average citizen. The Fairbanks Museum of .Natural Sci ence at St. Johnsbury was dedicated with appropriate exercises Dec. 15th. This is another ol the many munificent gifts that this beautiful village has received from the Fairbanks family. Col. W. W. Clapp, for over twenty-five years editor of the Boston Journal, died suddenly in Boston Dee. 8th. He made the Journal the foremost newspaper in New England and leaves it behind as the best, monument by which to perpetuate his name. The President's Message, which the readers of this paper received in the Her ald Extra early Thursday, is conceded by all conservative papers to be an able, can did and strong state paper. The Presi dent has made very few mistakes and is daily gaining in the estimation of all good citizens. We are glad to note that Gaysville is aoon to have a lively boom. A stock com pany has been formed, the old brick fac tory is to be re-built and the manufacture of buttons begun. Buttons were once ' manufactured there successfully till a re duction in the tariff rendered competition of American help against foreign pauper labor hopeless. The secret is out. Had the democrats succeeded in their desperate attempt to steal the legislature of New York, the presidential electors, would have been chosen by the legislature and the people of the great Empire State deprived of all chance to vote in the presidential election of 1S92-. It is charged t hat David B. Hill had the bill all drawn to consummate this outrage. The trouble with the caucus system is that the people do not and will not turn out and attend them. In this state a nom ination is almost equivalent to an election. It is the bighest;duty then of every citizen to attend the caucuses and see that the best men are nominated. This paper has for years urged this duty upon the voters of both parties and we propose to begin early this year and keep it op.. Score another point for the McKinley bill. The manufacturers' price list of carpets for 1892 has Just been issued to the trade and there is a cut in tne prices of 10 to 20 cents a yard in the higher grades and even more in tfiose in common nse. In not a single rase bas the price been ad vanced and in only one instance bas the old price been retained. This means that the people can buy carpet the coming year cheaper than ever before in this country. The McKinley bill was Irani-' ed in the interest of the people and the people are already reaping the benefit in lower prices. j The Vermont Farmer's Advocate charg- j es that "the convention bas been too ab- j solutely controlled by pecuniary obiiga- tions of delegates to candidates" and de mands a halt. This is strong language. We demand the proof. Name a conven tion of either political party in this state that has been controlled by Tioney or where a majority of its delegates were 'con trolled absolutely by pecuniary obliga tions to candidates,' nd furnish . names, date and reasonable proof to substantiate the claim. It is just auch statements as this that the people know cannot be prov ed and aro not true, that discredit and lessen the editorial influence of the news papers. The New York Son of Dec, 10th con tained the following editorial that we commend as showing what the McKinley bill is doing: "Ships! ships! we now descry them Out on the main!" , And they are American-built ships, of . eteel and of iron and of wood; and tbeyl fro by steam or by sail; and they are for! fight or for trade; and their names are! the New York, the Newark, the Philadel phia, the Baltimore, the Cincinnati, the' Machias. the Montgomery, the San Fran-I cisoo. the Raleigh, the Oreeon, the Texas, the Indiana, the Massachusetts and yet : other names. And in the Maine shin- I yards there hare been built this year 134 I I vessels of various kinds, including stenm ! ers, schooners mid sloops. And the suip ; yards on our Western takes, as well hk un I on' suabaard, are busy this winter; and I i whale.mc-ks are built at West Superior, and sttiamnhip are built at Cleveland and I other plnc.jH. Aud from M.iine to Oregon j t he shipbuilder are laying kudu. We oulil to bave a thousand new Amer ican-omit vessels for the trade of our own waters and the commerce of the sous. And we should have them before tne close of the nineteenth century, that has but eignt yjars to run. Mate Politics. The Boston Journal rei-ently had a long article on Vermont politics and takes practically the same view of the situation that this paper did in a recent article. It says : . The Republican State Convention for the nomination of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, State Tress urer and Auditor of Accounts, will prob- amy oe nem in June, j ne time lor bold ing the convention is not too distant for the consideration of the question of can didates for these several oltices. In fact, a quiet discussion is in progress in political circles over tne uubernatorial nomination to be made six months hence Since the inauguration of the biennial system of elections in 1872, no Governor nas neen nominated lor a seoona term The re-nomination of the present excel lent Executive of the State has been sug gested by some of his numerous friends, but the proposition meets with noenoour agement from Governor Page. He fully appreciates the compliment paid him in this expressed approval of his administra tion, hut he feels that be bas already been highly honored by the people of Vermont anu that bis retirement Horn tne uovern orship at the end ot his present term is not only in compliance with a long-established precedent, but is necessitated by personal aud business reasons. Governor Pa ire has made one of the '.best Executives the State has had for. many yerrs, and bis administration has been of a businesslike character, creditable both to himself and the State. He will let ire from the Governorship with the well-deserted commendation of his constituents, w bom be has served faithfully and well. Among those who. have been proposed to bead the Slate ticket are Hon. Levi K. Fuller of Brattleboro. Hon. Henry A. Fletcher of Cavendish and Hon. Josinb Grout of Derby. The custom of promoting Lieutenant Governors to the Governorship prevailed with more or less regularity up to 1888, when Hon. Levi K. Fuller, who was made Lieutenant Governor in IHStt, broke the precedent by disallowing 'be use of his name as a candidate for Governor, in pur suance of a pledge made by his friends in lue convention iu n una lie nun Bricvwy for Lieutenant Governor. In 1WX) Lieut. Gov. Woodbury was defeated for tbe nom ination for Governor, largely by the non promotion idea which prevailed with many delegates. The friends of Hon. Levi K. Fuller now come forward and urge his nomination for Governor. They say that the prece dent of promotion from tbe Lieutenant Governorship to the higher olliee was broken by Col. Fuller and that as four years have intervened since he held the lower office he is wholly disassociated from the position and would enter the field on precisely the same footing as a man who bad never been Lieutenant Gov ernor. He bas many supporters for tbe head of the ticket. Col. Fuller is a lead ing member of the Estey Organ Company of Brattleboro. He was Senator from Windham county in 1880 and is comman der of the Fuller Light Battery, National Guard of Vermont. In ISHti, as before stated, be was elected Lieutenant Govern or, he is public spirited and a liberal contributor to educational and religious objects. He bas an extensive acquaint ance in the State, and is well known in business circles elsewhere. Lieut. Gov. Henry A. Fletcher of Caven dish has many warm friends w bo would like to see him promoted to the Governor ship, it is staled, however, by bis imme diate supporters that be is not a candidate (or the nomination. He was a soldier in the war of the Union and is a successful Windsor county farmer. He made a pop ular presiding officer of tbe Senate and made many friends during the last ses sion of the Legislature. Tbe advoi-ates of the nomination of Lieut. Gov. Fletcher are somewhat embarrassed by the fact that the Republican 8tnt Conventions in 1888 and 1S90 failed to continue tbe precedent of directly promoting the Lieutenant Gov ernor and" went directly outside of the in cumbent of that office in selecting a can didate for Governor. The present Lieut enant Governor is on record as being a gainst the promotion rule in 18510, but his mends argue mat me precedent ui uuu promotion has been established by tbe ac tion of tbe two last State Conventions, and that there are no good and sufficient rea sons w by the people should not exercise their choice and make the Lieut. Govern or t heir choice for Governor in 1892. The name of Major Josiab Grout of Der by bas been occasionally mentioned in political circles, for the Gubernatorial nomination in lwri. Major Grout is a I'nion veteran and one of the largest farmers in Orleans county. He was speak er of tbe Vermont House in lam and lss8 and made an excellent record. Major Grout is not in tbe held for nomination, but his position in the matter is under-j stood to be this: That it is early for can- didaU to declare themselves and that he dof not intend to seek the office, but in : this respect is w illing to await tha pleas- ure of tbe people. V hen jver they desire j his services in that high position be ex pects they will in some suitable way let him know. When tbe office seriously seeks him and he believes such .to be the case he will consider the matter. Major Grout is favorably know n to tbe people of Vermont. Of coarse the field is always open to "dark" horses, and it is rumored that sev eral good ones are being groomed for tbe Gubernatorial race. 1 bave heard the names of Hon. Victor I Spear of Brain tree, Hon. William Chapin of Middlesex and Col. Franklin Fairbanks of St. Johns bury suggested for the nomination -ii good men and true. Vermont Mooms. Gaysville, too, bas taken the bull by tbe horns. It has raised f-xWO and will build a button shop. Button, button, who s got tne button? Why, Gaysville of course. - Bethel comes to the front with a new and novel industry. It is tbe transporta tion of branches of spruce to New York city for Christmas greenery. The (boughs are done up in closely packed bundles of 100 pounds ch and over 100 of these ban dies are put into a car. Bethel took fiiiOO from the New Yorkers this season in this way. St. Johnsbury Republican. Tile President's M'-sii;e. This is the season of the year w hen the heads of departments send in their reports to the Chief Executive, and from these reports tbe latter mates up a mes.sr.gi-, stating-what he may have done himself, aud sends it out to the people. It is by this means that the chief officer of the government preserves the fiction of act ing as the chief servant of the people. In fuct, t lie officers of the government are.the people's servants and are in duty bound to account for their conduct as faithfully as the humblest servant to his Master. Act ing as servant, Pres. Harrison has once more accounted to the people, bis Muster And his work is open to the inspection and criticism of each particle of that vast body that in its concrete capacity we call servant. Very few people read these mes sages. It involves too much time and la bor. A few can spare these. More read by proxy, i. e., a man glances at the docu ment, assumes to have read it, puts on the appearance of wisdom when reference is made to it and the world wags along. It is expected that the newspaper men will know all about tbe message, whether they have read it or mt, and be able to give an intelligent explanation ot it. We do not often read these messages. "The Century" is much more interesting. But we have read this message. We were placed in circumstances where we could attend to it, and we can say that Pres. Harrison, as one of our servants has done the work of the past y'ear in a very com mendable way. He has had some difficult and unpleasant work to do, but we do not see bow he could have done it better. He bas had some unpleasant characters to get along with. He has been vexed and liar assed by some who should have been I help. But he has shown a good deal of wisdom in getting along with difficult matters. He has been able to work out difficult men, and on tbe whole has made a clear account of himself. We like the message. We call understand it. It is plain reading. It is not much like mod ern attempts to prove the inerrancy of the Old Testament. It deals with every day matters. It tells us about the admission of our pork into foreign countries after attempts had, been made to shut it out. And the progress it reports is exceeding ly interesting. We are glad we are not compelled to eat all the hogs that are dal ly passing through the State. It tells us how many brakemen were killed on our railroads the past year, and suggests that something be done to save the lives of these men. The figures will gradually work out as tbe "Odds and Ends" of plate matter and go to enlighten the people. A great many excellent little things have been done by Mr. Blaine to help along our commercial relations with the various countries of South America. This has come about as a matter of necessity, as this foreign trade wa being stolen away from us by European nations. The Whiting Library at C hester. The Whiting library at Chester is one of the most beautiful in New England. It was given to the tow n by Dr. Laurin G. Whiting and Abigail B. Whiting, bis wife. Dr. Whiting, who bad made a good fortune by tbe successful practice of his profession in Chester and vicinity, died in June, 1887, and by will bequeathed a certain sum for a free library, and also gave his wife tbe use of one-half of his es tate during her life and the right to dis pose of it by will. She died in May, 1888, and after a few specific requests gave the rest of the estate that she bad tbe right to dispose of to the town for a library. The town elected three trustees to bave tne con trol aud management of tbe fund Clar ence Adams, F. P. Mather and Hugh Hen ry, l be plans lor tne building were oy George H. Gurnsey of Montpelier, the same arcnitect wno designed tile Human Catholic church and the hospital of the soldiers' home in Bennington and many other buildings throughout tbe state. Tbe library front is 38 feet and the depth 47 feet. The basement, lighted by 19 win dows, is 5 1-2 feet below grade and 3 1-2 feet above, and is designed to be used for various collections. Tbe foundation of the building, 312 feet above ;rade, is of cut Chester granite, a gray stone of fine texture and susceptible of fine polish, and almost undistinguisbable from the cele brated Barre granite. The building itself is of dark brick, w ith trimmings of cloud ed marble. As one enters at the(front he passes into a vest ibule 5x8 feet. from one side of which stairs lead to tne rooms above and to tbe basement. At t he right is the lobby or resting room, 8 by 10 feet, and leading from this toward the west is a good-sized reading room. This is one of the pleas antest rooms in the building, as from its western windows a fine view of the park and the upper half of Main street is had. To the south of the resting room, after passing the librarian's room, is the book room, w hich is designed for 11,000 vol- umes. Ail ot tne interior wood nnisn is of quartered oak. The building is heated by a furnace in the basement, but the read ing room has an open fireplace and polish ed mantel. The contractors for the build ing were the Eagle Square Manufacturing company of South Shaftabury, Theodore A. Carpenter of Bath-on-the-Hudson hav ing general supervision of the work and Joseph Belgard and Frank Reynolds the special oversight of the mason and wood work respectively. Few towns in New England can boast of a more artistic and convenient library. Rutland Herald.

All societies are cautioned to be careful in the selection of officers for he ensuing year. Miss Lizzie Simonds of Aid No. 6, Barnet, recently died and tha burial service of the L. A. 8. ritual was sed for the first time in this division. In tbe recent sad and sudden daaths of Com rades E H. Trick of Burlington and Ira Langdon of Brandon the closest ties have been severed for some of our sisters and a sense of loss laid upon those Societies in which these men bad snown so -great an merest. We must all experience a sad ness at tbe removal of such men. It fore shadows the swift approach of the day when none or those wno onerea tneiriivea for our country in the trying time of the late war will remain to us. Let it be a continual reminoer to do what we may for them while yet they are with us. The war department has issued a medal of honor to Bvt. Maj.-Gen. N. M. Curtis, U. 8. Volunteers, lor distinguisnea per sonal bravery in tbe assault and capture of Fort Fisher, North Carolina, Jan. 15, 1865. Gen. Curtis was the first man to pass through the stockade and he used his sword, while his men used their bayo nets in driving the confederate gunners from the guns. At the fifth traverse, a shell exploded among his men, kilting or seriously wounding all but four. tien. Cur tis took the muskets of these me.i and fir ed upon the enemy while waiting for sup ports to be brought forward. On this day he recetved six wounds, one destroying his left eve. There are other battles in hich Gen. Curtis has shown distinguish ed valor as well as rare ability in com manding troops, and he has been mention ed.many times in orders. For instance.on the 16th of May, 1864, at the battle of Dm ry's Bluff, while colonel commanding the 142d N. Y. infantry, he performed heroic work, and was complimented by Uen.A.W. Turner commanding the division. Also on the 6th of May, 1862, while captain of the 16th N. Y. Vols, in tbe peninsular cam paign, he did gallant service and was so severely wounded that there weie serious doubts of his recovery. For this service he received special commendation from Maj.-Gens- Slocum and Franklin. Gen. Curtis's fame as a soldier and a gentleman is well known to Vermonters, some of whom bad the pleasure of serving with him and all are pleased at this recognition of his valor by Congress. Gen. Curtis is a resident of Ogdensburg, N. Y., and has just been elected member- of Congress from his district and will make his mark there as he did in the army.
